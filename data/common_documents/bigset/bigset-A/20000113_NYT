FRIENDS PAY TRIBUTE TO LEMON
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Bob Lemon was a sacred part of baseball
lore, but he was a man without pretenses who never left Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   He was with the Cleveland Indians that memorable post-World War
II summer of 1948 when they became the first major league franchise
to draw more than 2 million fans and when he and Lou Boudreau and
Bob Feller and Gene Bearden led the Indians to a World Series
title.
</P>
<P>
   He was the losing pitcher for the Indians against the New York
Giants at the Polo Grounds that early October afternoon in 1954
when Willie Mays made his legendary over- the-shoulder catch of Vic
Wertz's 440- foot drive to center field and when Dusty Rhodes
touched him for a 254-foot game-winning home run.
</P>
<P>
   He was the winning manager for the New York Yankees on Oct. 2,
1978 at Fenway Park when an unlikely hero, Bucky Dent, would launch
a seventh- inning, three-run homer that would slay the Boston Red
Sox in a division playoff game and ultimately would give the
Yankees the opportunity to beat the Los Angeles Dodgers in the
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1976 after a 13-year
career in which he had eight 20-win seasons on the way to a 207-128
record, routinely facing such renowned batsmen as Joe DiMaggio and
Ted Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite his immense achievements and his widespread fame,
Robert Granville Lemon, who passed away Tuesday evening at 79,
remained the same unassuming, low-key person he was as a teenager
when he graduated from Wilson High in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   He never changed, and he inspired such great fondness from those
people he befriended that one of them, George Steinbrenner, the
notoriously fickle Yankee owner, never stopped sending him
paychecks even though Lemon retired from the organization several
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob was the most regular guy I've ever known in my life,''
says Bob Harrison, the longtime major league baseball scout and
contemporary of Lemon who graduated from Jordan High in 1938. ``He
never once talked about being a Hall of Famer, or about anything he
did in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never heard Bob Lemon say an unkind word about another human
being,'' says Chuck Stevens, the one-time St. Louis Browns and
Hollywood Stars first baseman who graduated from Poly High in 1937.
``He might have been the nicest, kindest and most gentle man I ever
met in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Stevens pauses a moment, and then says, ``I also never saw
a man enjoy a cigarette and a pop as much as Bob. He was his
happiest when he was smoking a cigarette, having a toddy, and
sitting around with his pals shooting the breeze about baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Bob Lemon became a fixture at monthly Thursday
afternoon gatherings among former professional ball players at
various local restaurants. He usually would attend with one of his
closest friends, Bob Sturgeon, a one-time Chicago Cubs shortstop
and Pacific Coast League performer who graduated from Poly High in
1936.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lem and I had a lot of laughs and fun times together,'' says
Sturgeon, who now resides in Chino Hills. ``We were very close. I'm
the one who introduced him to his wife Jane. She was working at the
same place my dad was working, Strickland's, which was a radio and
electronics store at Fifth and Pine. I stood up for Lem when he
married Jane in around 1941 and he stood up for me when I got
married a year later.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nicest thing about Lem is that I never heard him downgrade
anyone. He was just a person who liked everyone, and everyone liked
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Lemon was a third baseman at Wilson High, and played that
position for a time with the Indians until the Cleveland manager,
Lou Boudreau, decided Lemon had a brighter future as a pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was playing for the St. Louis Browns in 1946, and Lou
Boudreau asked me before a game with the Indians if I had ever seen
Lemon pitch,'' relates Chuck Stevens. ``I told him I saw Lemon
pitch during the War years for the Los Alamitos Navy Base team, and
that he could really throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, darned if Boudreau doesn't pitch Lemon that day, and the
first hitter he faces is me. I hit a double off him, sliding into
second base. Lemon came over and said, `What the hell you doing to
me?'
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't long before Lemon got the grasp of pitching, and
became terrific at it. He had a great sinker. He had one of those
fastballs that just sank naturally. And what made him even more
effective as a pitcher is that he was like an infielder out there
at the mound. No one could bunt on him. And he also helped himself
often with the bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Another close friend of Bob Lemon, Red Meairs, the old Long
Beach Nitehawk manager, recalls the time in the late 1940s when his
team was in a softball tournament in Davenport, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a day off, and took the train over to Chicago to watch
Lem pitch against the White Sox,'' recalls Meairs, a 1941 Wilson
High graduate. ``We all visited him at the hotel before the game,
and he wouldn't let us go. And then he paid for all of our tickets
to the game. That was Lem. A very kind, generous person.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like an end of an era for me. I've known Lem every
since I was a kid. Heck, I grew up at 10th and Belmont and he grew
up at 10th and Ximeno. We used to play touch football all the time
around Wilson High, and years later after baseball games we used to
go over to Pop Lemon's gas station at Fourth and Termino and have
some sandwiches and beers together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the Navy with Lem, and we were stationed together for
a time at the Los Alamitos Navy Base. We had a heck of a baseball
team. Lem and I had so much fun together. He took me to the Hall of
Fame in Cooperstown about five years ago, and we had a blast. Great
memories with Lem. Nothing but great memories.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Lemon might have been the most down to earth guy ever,''
says Jerry Gardner, the venerable scout for the Tampa Bay Devil
Rays who graduated from Jordan High in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   During an interview I had with Bob Lemon last year at Phil
Trani's, the old baseball player said he knew the hours were
drawing to a close.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't betray a hint of depression.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ol' Lem seemed quite content that glad afternoon, as he
puffed happily on a cigarette and sipped an alcoholic beverage with
practiced deliberation.

TAINTED FOOD, WATER DRAWS COUNTY'S EYE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RYAN KONIG  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - Maricopa County has nearly three times the number of
illnesses caused by tainted food and water than a community of this
size should have, the county's top health official says.
</P>
<P>
   And two-thirds of those cases were never investigated because of
a lack of staff and money, says Dr. Jonathan Weisbuch, director of
the county's Department of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``The causes could be any one of a million things,'' he said,
ranging from improperly cooked meals in homes or businesses to
people not washing their hands before they prepare food or eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, we simply don't know the causes. And if we don't
know, then we can't do anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Weisbuch says the department needs more money, about
$130,000 from the county's general fund, this year to help pay for
an epidemiologist, a specially trained nurse and an investigator to
find out what's making so many people sick.
</P>
<P>
   The county Board of Supervisors could vote within 30 days on the
health department's requested budget increase, Chairman Andrew
Kunasek said.
</P>
<P>
   Maricopa County currently investigates about a third of the
4,000 annual reports of food-borne and water-borne illnesses. If
the additional funds are approved, Weisbuch said, the county would
be able to investigate most of the remaining cases.
</P>
<P>
   Among the cases that were investigated last year include a
September outbreak in which 500 county jail inmates suffered
nausea, stomach cramps and vomiting. Lab tests indicate the cause
may have been a tainted dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Another incident last year involved 21 people who became ill
after drinking unpasteurized orange juice blended by a Tempe-based
company. That company, Sun Orchard, stopped producing unpasteurized
orange juice.
</P>
<P>
   The caseload of 4,000 reported food- and water-borne illnesses
is nearly three times higher than it should be for a community of
this size, based on a recent study from the national Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Weisbuch said. The expected rate of
these illnesses is about 50 cases per 100,000 people, he said.
</P>
<P>
   By that count, the Phoenix area should have had 1,500 cases,
instead of 4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Weisbuch said the high number may be partly due to population
growth:
</P>
<P>
   ``We are adding 100,000 people every year to this community, and
1,000 new food businesses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   People new to the Phoenix area may need time to figure out how
to properly store or prepare foods that are more common to this
area, Weisbuch said. Even something as simple as leaving groceries
in a car for too long in the summer can foster bacteria growth to
unhealthful levels.
</P>
<P>
   Improper temperature is a leading cause of food contamination,
said David Ludwig, who is in charge of the food service inspections
division of Maricopa County Environmental Services.
</P>
<P>
   Some foods need to be heated to at least 190 degrees to kill off
bacteria. Others foods need to be stored at low temperatures to
curb growth of bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   There's a complicated set of heating and cooling procedures
needed for cooking, reheating, storing and serving different kinds
of foods, Ludwig said. Otherwise, bacteria could grow to the point
that they could cause illness. &QL;

EDITORIAL: THE LAW ON ELIAN GONZALEZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Thursday, Jan. 13: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno has correctly asserted that the
tangled case of Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban boy now living
with relatives in Miami, must be decided under federal immigration
law, not in the Florida courts. Her declaration will not settle the
complicated dispute that pits the Clinton administration and the
Immigration and Naturalization Service against congressional
conservatives and anti-Castro Cubans in Miami. But it is a start
toward legal clarity, which represents the best road out of a mess
where political agreement will never be possible.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Reno acknowledged in a letter to lawyers for the boy's
Miami relatives, the INS created great confusion with its initial
announcement that it ``could not grant custody and that such a
request would have to be put before the state courts.'' But as a
matter of law, the INS has authority to make the determination that
Elian's father in Cuba is the boy's lawful guardian. Immigration
law experts agree that the Florida family court that intervened in
the case by awarding temporary custody to a great-uncle in Miami
does not have the authority to overrule the INS. Ms. Reno said in
her letter that the government was prepared to go to federal court
to enforce its primacy in the case, and it should do so promptly.
</P>
<P>
   State-federal jurisdictional disputes were common in civil
rights cases in the '60s, and experience shows that calm
persistence in asserting the primacy of federal law is the best
course. Cooling-off periods can be valuable, too. So the INS
decision to extend the Jan. 14 deadline for returning the boy to
his father was prudent. That will give time for resolving the legal
disputes.
</P>
<P>
   It is too much to hope, of course, that political passions will
burn themselves out in that time. As one anti-Castro leader in
Miami said, Elian has become a symbol of that community's 41 years
of frustration with Fidel Castro and with its shorter-term anger at
the Clinton administration. But it is possible that the hysteria in
Congress, with its plans to bring Elian to Washington to testify or
grant him instant citizenship, will recede.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, it is clear that the INS should have acted more
confidently and promptly. But the fact that the INS let relatives
in Miami care for the boy does not give them a custody claim that
overrides federal law. Elian has remained in the exclusive legal
custody of the federal government since his arrival. The INS
correctly determined that the boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
is his sole lawful guardian, and has the right to make the decision
to have the child returned to Cuba. There is no basis in law for
overturning Gonzalez's claim because he lives in a Communist
country.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has the legal authority to enforce
the INS decision immediately. But the sounder and less disruptive
course would be, as Ms. Reno suggested in her letter, to settle the
matter in the proper federal court. That should take place before
the Florida judge, Rosa I. Rodriguez, convenes her evidentiary
hearing on March 6 and further stirs up the local community _ as
well as those in Congress and on the presidential campaign trail
who want to take advantage of this case.

EDITORIAL: SOFT-MONEY NEGOTIATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Thursday, Jan. 13: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The campaign managers for Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rudolph
Giuliani have begun a tentative discussion about eliminating soft
money from the Senate contest in New York. It is in the interest of
both sides to ban these unregulated expenditures. The talks between
Bruce Teitelbaum of the Giuliani campaign and Bill de Blasio of the
Clinton campaign got off to a positive start and should not end
with the testy letters the two exchanged Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The danger, absent an agreement, is that the need to raise a lot
of money will be taken as a license by both campaigns to engage in
financing schemes that circumvent federal limits on large donations
to individual candidates. Enforcement of the fund-raising limits by
the Justice Department and the Federal Election Commission now
verges on nonexistent, heightening the temptation to cheat. New
Yorkers, however, like voters elsewhere, have a right to expect
contests for powerful positions to be waged on higher ethical
ground.
</P>
<P>
   The early signs in this campaign were not encouraging. Giuliani
used New York City's tourist agency, NYC &AMP; Co., to run radio ads in
the city and upstate using the mayor's voice. Moreover, for much of
the past two years, Giuliani collected money through two political
committees that are subject to more lenient fund-raising
restrictions than his official Senate campaign committee. Using a
federal ``leadership account,'' Solutions America, and another
fund-raising committee established under lax New York rules to aid
elections to state offices like governor, Giuliani was able to
raise more than $800,000 from donors who would otherwise have
reached the $2,000 limit for his Senate campaign committee. The
committees shared at least one major fund-raising event, as well as
rent, administrative costs and salaries, including that of the
mayor's chief political aide, Teitelbaum. Apparently, the mayor
largely stopped raising and spending money through the two
committees after April 1999, when he formally notified the Federal
Election Commission that he might run for the United States Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, meanwhile, has exacerbated fears of a fall
campaign run in large part outside the normal federal limits by
aggressively channeling big, unregulated soft-money donations to a
special party ``victory fund'' to help pay for television spots
promoting her Senate candidacy. Giuliani, to his credit, has not
begun raising or spending soft money. But without a soft-money
truce, evasive fund-raising by both sides would inevitably spiral
out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Now both candidates seem to agree in principle to a ban on soft
money. De Blasio broke the ice Wednesday by phoning Teitelbaum. In
a follow-up letter, Teitelbaum said that Mrs. Clinton should repay
the Democratic Party for the nearly $400,000 in ads it ran for her
this summer. De Blasio fired back by citing Giuliani's suspect
committees and the NYC &AMP; Co. ads, and accused the Giuliani campaign
of rejecting further talks. Such posturing is understandable in any
political negotiation, but the matter should not end there.
Giuliani and Mrs. Clinton should instruct their managers to meet
and agree that neither of the national parties will be allowed to
flood New York with advertising financed by soft money.

EDWARD R. CONY, 76, FORMER TOP EDITOR OF THE WALL STREET JOURNAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (js) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Edward R. Cony, a former managing editor of The Wall Street
Journal, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1961 as a reporter for the
paper, died on Sunday in Santa Cruz, Calif. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pneumonia and complications from Alzheimer's
disease, said Richard J. Tofel, vice president for corporate
communications at Dow Jones &AMP; Co., which publishes The Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Cony had spent the last five years in a nursing home in Santa
Cruz but kept a residence in Aptos, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Cony announced that he had Alzheimer's in March 1988, a few
weeks before he was to have become president of the American
Society of Newspaper Editors. Although he had decided not to take
the post, the society's board elected him president before
accepting his resignation a few hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Roger Cony was born in Augusta, Maine, on March 15, 1923.
He served in the Army from 1943 to 1946. He earned a bachelor's
degree from Reed College and a master's degree from Stanford
University.
</P>
<P>
   He became a reporter, starting at The Oregonian in Portland,
Ore. In 1953, he joined The Journal as a reporter in its San
Francisco bureau. He later was bureau chief in Los Angeles and
Jacksonville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, he received the Pulitzer Prize for national reporting
for articles about business ethics in the timber industry.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, Cony became managing editor, the highest ranking news
position at the paper then and now. He became executive editor of
Dow Jones publications and news services in 1970, was named a vice
president of Dow Jones in 1972 and in 1976 became president of the
Dow Jones division that published The Asian Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, Cony became a vice president for news at Dow Jones, and
in 1980 was elected to the board of Ottaway Newspapers, a
subsidiary of Dow Jones. He was also president of the Dow Jones
Newspaper Fund from 1981 through 1988, as well as an associate
editor of The Journal from 1986 to 1988, when he retired.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Susan; a son, Daniel Cony of Aptos;
five daughters, Ann Cony of Sacramento, Calif., Elizabeth Hiltz of
Aptos, Katherine Dunn of Manhasset, N.Y., Marilyn Cony of Portland
and Lauren Cony of San Francisco; a sister, Margaret Cony of
Portland; and 10 grandchildren.

DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION PLANS ON SCHEDULE

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- With hopes the whole world will be watching in
seven months, officials planning the Democratic National Convention
in Los Angeles said Wednesday they are on schedule for the August
event nominating their next presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, can the trains run on time?'' said Lydia
Camarillo, chief executive officer of the event. ``We are confident
they will.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been working closely with the mayor, the Department of
Transportation, Caltrans, the Police Department and the Secret
Service and everything is on track.''
</P>
<P>
   The three-day event will involve some 4,600 delegates and more
than 17,000 media staying in 84 hotels in six cities in and around
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   At ground zero for all the attention will be the Staples Center,
which Joe Andrew, national chairman of the Democratic National
Committee, said has exceeded expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is such a new building wired for modern technology,
Andrew said the arena will allow Democrats to reach out beyond the
traditional media to include broad Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone in Florida wants to see what their delegation is
doing, they will be able to hook in immediately,'' Andrew said.
``If they are concerned about an issue, they will be able to track
where it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew said he is particularly pleased at the selection of Los
Angeles with its diverse population and emphasis on new technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have a convention that looks like and reflects
America,'' Andrew said. The party's nominee probably will be known
long before the convention, but Andrew said the party will not
attempt to make it simply an entertainment spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be about content and what the Democratic agenda is
for the next four years.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew also disputed accounts of any problems with the Los
Angeles Host Committee, which has promised to provide some
$33.5million in cash and services to offset the cost of the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The host committee has done everything we have asked of it and
has been there when we needed them.''

MARTIN RIDING INTO THE PGA TOUR AND UNDER A WORLDWIDE MICROSCOPE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   To reach the PGA Tour, Casey Martin has persevered through legal
battles, a painful disease, and intense media attention that has
made him a household name.
</P>
<P>
   So when Martin begins his rookie season at next week's Bob Hope
Chrysler Classic, excuse him for being nervous, as well as excited.
After successfully suing the tour in 1998 for the right to use a
golf cart during competition, Martin is about to realize a dream.
But once again, he will be playing under a worldwide microscope.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most stressful thing I deal with is the fear of failure,''
said Martin, who suffers from Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome, a
disease that affects circulation in his right leg. ``I don't want
to let people down. I've played well enough to make the PGA Tour,
and I hope and pray I will be able to continue playing as well as
I'm capable.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who spoke on a conference call from his hometown of
Eugene, Ore., earned his PGA Tour card by finishing among the top
15 winners on last year's Nike Tour, a satellite tour a level below
the PGA Tour. But Martin's long-term future remains uncertain. He
still deals with intense pain in his fragile right leg, and one
wrong step could lead to the end of his career. ``I'm at a high
risk for a fracture,'' Martin said. ``If I were to twist my leg, it
could break. My leg in the tibia region is very weak, which is why
I'm very grateful to have the buggy.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin won the right to play on the PGA Tour when a federal
judge in Eugene granted an injunction that required the Tour to
furnish him with a cart at all of its events, as well as those on
its satellite tour. At the time, he was the first professional
athlete to successfully sue under the Americans With Disabilities
Act for a change in a sports organization's playing rules.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Tour has filed an appeal, and a decision on the appeal
is expected some time this year. If the Tour wins the appeal,
Martin will consider further legal action, because the cart has
become a necessity for him to compete consistently with the world's
best players.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had not walked a round of golf since late in 1997.
``It has been a long time,'' he said. ``I hope and pray I don't
have to find out, but I don't know if I could go 72 holes or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a decline in my leg the last five or six years,
however we've noticed that since I've been riding, the
deterioration has kind of leveled. It hasn't gotten any better, but
it hasn't gotten any worse either. I think that's due to the fact
that there's less wear and tear.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin has also entered the Phoenix Open the week following the
Bob Hope, and he said he tentatively plans to play around 25
events. Tour players are divided on the Martin issue, with some who
feel he should be given a cart, while others believe that the Tour,
not the courts, should govern the rules of the game.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Martin is not worried about how he will be received on
tour, and he scoffs at the notion that a cart gives him an unfair
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had any problems with the guys on the Nike Tour,''
said Martin, who will be reunited on the PGA Tour with two former
Stanford teammates, Tiger Woods and Notah Begay. ``Not everyone
agreed with it, but I never had one problem,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't played with the PGA Tour guys enough to know, but I
don't anticipate any problems. There might be some, you never know.
I'll be able to answer that question better in a month,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walk more than you might think during a round. A lot of
times you can't really get close to a green. I read one paper that
said I would walk zero, but that's ridiculous. I walk a
considerable amount, and there's no top to the cart, so if it's
raining or hot, I'm totally exposed, which is good.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Martin has shown an ability to play his best under
pressure, both on the Nike Tour, and during the 1998 U.S. Open,
when he tied for 23rd, finishing higher than Vijay Singh, Mark
O'Meara, Justin Leonard and Ernie Els.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Martin will begin testing his game at the highest
level. And while he is uncertain how he will fare, he is grateful
for the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a thrill, but it's a challenge,'' said Martin. ``Most
people don't deal with the kind of attention I deal with until
they've won majors or shot 59 to win tournaments. But I've grown
accustomed to it. When I tee it up next week, it will be like a
dream come true.''  &QL;

AN AVENGING ANGEL ON THE TRAIL OF THE PIGEON POISONER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)  (mk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As sympathetic victims, common urban pigeons _ even
those murdered by the elusive poison-wielding serial killer who has
been stalking them in Manhattan for the past two years _ are a
tough sell.
</P>
<P>
   Mark MacDonald, a detective for the American Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals who has become the guardian angel
of all living local pigeons and an avenging angel for the deceased,
accepts that the 8 million or so pigeons that use New York as their
personal coop-and-poop receptacle will never be mistaken for man's
best friend.
</P>
<P>
   The ancient Egyptians and Romans found pigeons most useful when
cooked; Venice recently dealt with its pigeon overpopulation
problem by gassing 20,000 birds. In New York, exterminators can use
avitrol, a legal poison, to eliminate nuisance birds who befoul the
terraces, windows and canopies of the city's luxury abodes.
MacDonald bemoans but accepts that, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every 50 pigeons killed today, there's 50 more born
tomorrow,'' he says. But propagation isn't the point. What
MacDonald doesn't accept is mean-spirited murder, especially murder
with a domino effect that has also killed hawks, peregrines,
sparrows, bluejays and a pair of Central Park mallards: ``This Mr.
Evil is never going to make pigeons an endangered species,''
asserts the gray-muzzled MacDonald, who slicks his hair back Eddie
Munster-style and whose investigative mode is equal parts DeNiro,
Columbo and Dumbo (he says it helps to play dumb when you're about
to confiscate an illegal or battered pet or to collar the
ringleaders and patrons at pit-bull and cock fights).
</P>
<P>
   Against the pigeon killer, though, MacDonald is trying to play
it smart. He has to: ``He's going to make my life miserable until
he makes a mistake and we catch him, and God forbid the poison does
trickle down to a child or a domestic pet before we get him.''
</P>
<P>
   With or without public sympathy, but with the support of
``National Geographic Explorer,'' which ran a special about his
efforts last Sunday on CNBC (it will be rebroadcast on Saturday),
MacDonald is staying his course. There's a killer on the loose, and
he intends to find him, cuff him and charge him with animal
cruelty, now a felony that commands a four-year jail term and
$2,500 fine.
</P>
<P>
   It's an unsolved metropolitan mystery where the trail has turned
cold after more than a thousand deaths. The detective has
nightmares about the elusive bird-hater who continues to toss an
illegal and terribly toxic poison, carbofuran, into city streets
and parks where pigeons congregate. Accustomed to achieving closure
in his cases, MacDonald has become obsessed by his inability to do
so with this one, now in its third year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the very few cases in my career where I've done
what I swore I wouldn't do: Take the case home with me,'' he says
while rough-housing with Richie, a canine resident awaiting
adoption at the ASPCA's East 92nd Street headquarters. ``When I get
into the car, when I get home, when I'm with my kids, it's there. I
may be out on the lake fishing,'' says the detective, who practices
the catch-and-release method, ``but my brain is back on Fifth
Avenue, trying to figure out if there's some little detail I
missed.''
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the case of the pigeon perp was assigned to
MacDonald, an investigator for Humane Law Enforcement, a
pistol-wielding 13-person team that each year handles 4,500
complaints and makes 200 arrests.
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald, a 27-year veteran of the ASPCA, where he started out
cleaning kennels at 18 (and met his wife, who worked there 14
years), has a generous respect for all animals. Who else would feel
comfortable sharing office space with an impressively fanged
quartet of tarantulas (the biggest one is named Conan), a pair of
hissing cockroaches (one of his three children christened them Jack
and Jill), and a nasty-looking electric eel (call it Anonymous)
that packs an 1,100-volt charge. His Eeepy Creepy Day, which stars
confiscated animals, is always a big hit when he performs a
show-and-tell at city schools.
</P>
<P>
   He landed in the hospital with dog bites twice in the pre-1995
era when his squad, not the Center for Animal Control, was
responsible for rounding up strays, but MacDonald didn't hold it
against the biters. The Rottweiler who mauled his ribs was
defending his home, a junked car; the German shepherd who sank his
teeth through MacDonald's right hand was protecting a female. The
day he removed a pet bobcat from a Queens apartment, he ``felt like
a heel. They were taking wonderful care of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was MacDonald's fondness for pigeons, a relatively rare
trait in humans, that made him such a natural to pursue the case
when birds began convulsing, and dying, in droves two summers ago
on the Upper East Side. Aha! MacDonald's father once raised racing
pigeons, Canadian High Fliers and tiplets, back when he and his
five siblings were growing up in a Norwalk, Conn.,
household/menagerie that also contained dogs, cats, canaries, fish
and a monkey named Pete.
</P>
<P>
   He developed an appreciation for the birds, even the
nonpedigreed city pigeons. When MacDonald was 12, his father, an
engineer with Armstrong Rubber, was transferred and the family
moved to a tenement in Flatbush, Brooklyn. And that meant no more
rooftop coop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing those pigeons kind of broke my father's heart,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Like father, like son.

   Wendy Miller, an activities coordinator at Snowbird, Utah, was
leading a small group of people on snowshoes last month along a
mountain trail. The pace was easy because of the resort's
8,000-foot altitude. Most of the guests had just come from
sea-level destinations and were still adapting to the thin air.
</P>
<P>
   But one man kept disappearing into the woods, and Miller was
concerned. ``Snowshoeing is a great activity for people who don't
ski to get on the mountain,'' Miller said. ``Some people are afraid
of skiing, and some are even afraid of being in the mountains. But
I found out that the man who kept going off the trail had once
hiked the Himalayas. He was just trying out the snowshoes to see
how they felt. So I let him go ahead on his own.''
</P>
<P>
   The story reflects the widespread allure of snowshoeing, which
is drawing converts at every level. Ski areas, many for the first
time, are including snowshoes in their rental inventory. And at
least two national programs are touting what they see as the
fitness benefits of the shoe that walks _ or runs _ on snow.
</P>
<P>
   The national programs, a 12-week Venture-Reebok/WinterFit
instructional series and Winter Trails 2000, a free introductory
snowshoe fest this Saturday at 14 sites around the country, bespeak
the major marketing and sponsorship clout behind snowshoeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snowshoes offer the best transition from a workout club
environment to something more interesting than being inside all
winter,'' said Gary Johnson, a fitness expert for Reebok, the
athletic equipment company. ``They're comfortable and easy to learn
how to use.''
</P>
<P>
   Reebok has joined forces this year with Tubbs, the snowshoe
company based in Stowe, Vt., to offer its program in various gyms
and ski resorts. Besides Snowbird, snowshoe fitness classes are on
the schedule at Mountain Creek Resort, N.J.; Stratton Mountain,
Vt., and Catamount, N.Y. In addition, health clubs, such as the
Sports Mall Gym in Salt Lake City, begin aerobic preparations
indoors before urging people outside.
</P>
<P>
   The fitness component of snowshoeing is still being discovered.
A recent study by the University of Vermont reveals that
snowshoeing's movement is similar to running but without the same
physiological impact.
</P>
<P>
   The results indicated that, over a six-week period, snowshoeing
turned out to be better training for runners than running.
Researchers found that snowshoeing can burn up to 45 percent more
calories than walking or running at the same pace.
</P>
<P>
   The sport's surge in popularity began in the 1990s. The Sporting
Goods Manufacturers Association, a national trade group, estimates
that 1.7 million people tried snowshoeing at least once in 1998.
That compares to 7 million skateboarders and 5.4 million
snowboarders that same year.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the snowshoe craze comes from new technology that has
made snowshoes smaller and lighter than the five-foot-long bear paw
designs used by Alaskan fur trappers 50 years ago. Tubbs, for
example, now makes 27 different models, including snowshoes for
running. They range in price from $100 to $400.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're putting solid material where the old snowshoes were made
with hide lacing,'' said Kathy Murphy, marketing director for
Tubbs. ``The new materials are lightweight and practically
bulletproof.''
</P>
<P>
   Other manufacturers have come up with innovative designs created
for children. They include the T-Rex Snowshoe by Yuba, crafted in
the shape of a dinosaur foot, and the Snowpaw Snowshoe by
Redfeather, which is made to look like the print of an abominable
snowman.
</P>
<P>
   The Winter Trails 2000 event Saturday includes free snowshoe
lessons and equipment demonstrations at resorts such as Gore
Mountain, North Creek, N.Y.; Eagle Mountain at Lake Tahoe, Calif.;
the High Point X-C Center at Sussex, N.J., and the Tyrol Ski Basin,
Mt. Horeb, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   Snowshoeing takes about a six-inch snow base compared to about
two feet for skiing. But with a dearth of snow at many resort areas
this winter, organizers of Winter Trails suggest checking in with
the event's Web site at www.snowlink.com, or by telephoning the
American Hiking Society at (888) sno-hike. &QL;

THE PASSAGES OF PARIS AND OF BENJAMIN'S MIND  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some of us don't read fiction. We live on history, biography,
criticism, reporting and what used to be called belles-lettres. We
will be feasting on Walter Benjamin's ``Arcades Project'' for years
to come.
</P>
<P>
   Just published in its first full English-language edition, ``The
Arcades Project'' should also win readers with broader tastes. By
any standard, the appearance of this long-awaited work is a
towering literary event.
</P>
<P>
   A sprawling, fragmented meditation on the ethos of 19th-century
Paris, ``The Arcades Project'' was left incomplete on Benjamin's
death in 1940. In recent decades, as portions of the book have
appeared in English, the unfinished opus has acquired legendary
status.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arcades Project'' (Belknap Press/Harvard University Press,
$39.95) surpasses its legend. It captures the relationship between
a writer and a city in a form as richly developed as those
presented in the great cosmopolitan novels of Proust, Joyce, Musil
and Isherwood. Those who fall under Benjamin's spell may find
themselves less willing to suspend their disbelief in fiction. The
city will offer sufficient fantasy to meet most needs.
</P>
<P>
   Who was Walter Benjamin? For highbrow city lovers, he was the
Man of the 20th Century. His essays on Berlin and Paris have long
been required reading in art and architecture schools around the
world. They are among the seminal texts in the field of cultural
studies and the ethnographic approach it has fostered toward art.
</P>
<P>
   People read Benjamin not only (or even mainly) to learn about
the particular topics he took on _ Belle Epoque fashions, Art
Nouveau interiors, iron construction _ but also to absorb his
methods of urban analysis and extravagantly cultivated sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   For architecture critics, he stands as the supreme master at
subjecting buildings to the rigor of dialectical thinking. His
informed negations, his techniques for stripping away the lies a
society tells about itself, are among the sharpest tools we have
for unmasking the deceptions perpetrated by architects in the
present day.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin was born in Berlin in 1892 to a family of
upper-middle-class Jews. His father was a successful art dealer.
His formal education, which began in Berlin and continued in
Switzerland during World War I, included philosophy, literature and
aesthetics. In his early student days, Benjamin was active in the
Zionist movement.
</P>
<P>
   On his return to Berlin in 1920, he contributed book reviews and
essays to the feuilleton, or culture section, of the Frankfurter
Zeitung and other newspapers. His voice joined the raucous chorus
of the Weimar years.
</P>
<P>
   What became ``The Arcades Project'' started out as a newspaper
article. Benjamin worked on the project, with periodic
interruptions, from 1927 until his death 13 years later. In 1940,
fearing capture by the Nazis while he waited to cross the border
from France to Spain, Benjamin killed himself with an overdose of
morphine. He was 48.
</P>
<P>
   After his death, the manuscript was recovered by the essayist
Georges Batailles, who delivered it to the Bibliotheque National in
Paris, where Benjamin had conducted much of his research.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the published edition is divided into 36 sections,
labeled A-r. The translators call these sections convolutes, from
the Latin word for bundle, file, or sheaf, a reference to the
folders Benjamin used to organize the loose, handwritten pages of
his manuscript. The titles suggest the range of his subject matter.
The Flaneur. Baudelaire. Haussmanization. Fashion. Photography.
Prostitution. Gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Along with his own reflections, which range in length from one
sentence to several pages, the convolutes are stuffed with
undigested research material: passages from historical sources and
Benjamin's contemporaries in literature and philosophy. The book
includes two sections containing early drafts and sketches, and two
essays called ``exposes.'' Written in 1935 and 1939, and intended
as outlines, the essays are Benjamin's attempt to boil down his
fragments into extended expository form. As published, the book
gives readers the chance to digest this material for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The book is 960 pages long. Where to begin? The theoretical
heart of the book is Convolute N, ``On the Theory of Knowledge,
Theory of Progress.'' In fact, a reader could start anywhere. Like
a strand of intellectual DNA, every page contains the code to
Benjamin's sensibility. Forensics, anyone?
</P>
<P>
   The arcade itself is a building type that proliferated in early
19th-century Paris before Haussmann's grand boulevards ripped
through the city's ancient fabric. Typically sheltered beneath an
iron and glass roof, the arcade was a blocklong pedestrian passage
nestled between two masonry structures. It was lined on either side
with small shops, tearooms, amusements and other commercial
attractions.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, more than 300 arcades punctuated the Paris
cityscape. About 30 now remain, most of them clustered on the Right
Bank in the first and second arrondisements.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers to Europe may be more familiar with the still
fashionable British counterparts like London's Burlington and
Piccadilly Arcades. Milan's Galleria, near the Duomo, is the
cathedral of this commercial genre. More recently, the type has
reappeared in the mini-malls that dot the sprawling map of Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Some regard it as the embryo of the suburban shopping mall. The
arcade's most immediate progeny, however, was the grand magasin,
the imposing turn-of-the-century department store, exemplified by
Au Printemps and Galeries Lafayettes. The magasin was, in effect, a
vertical arcade, a stack of interior streets lined with handbags,
hats, cosmetics and other consumer goods and fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   For Benjamin, the Paris arcade was the most important building
type of the 19th century. The arcade may have lacked the heroic
muscularity of train stations, bridges and other feats of Victorian
engineering. It had none of the classical gravitas sought by the
Beaux Arts-trained architects of monumental public buildings.
</P>
<P>
   But the arcade represented a pivotal moment in modern history.
With it, society began its transition from a culture of production
to one of consumption. Beneath the arcade's greenhouse roof, the
technical apparatus of the industrial society was used to furnish
people's minds with images of desire. Benjamin will now take the
apparatus apart.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   His analytic approach could be summarized as a fusion of Marxist
and Freudian schools of thought. Benjamin did not read Marx until
late in life, however, and he rejected the scientific claims of
orthodox psychoanalysis. Perhaps on account of what Harold Bloom
calls the anxiety of influence, perhaps because he wished to avoid
the objective detachment these two ideologies claimed to represent,
Benjamin chose to absorb his ideas from indirect sources.
</P>
<P>
   From the philosopher Theodor Adorno, he acquired the skills of
``negative dialectic,'' a rejection of the classical idea that the
process of negation should lead to positive conclusions. From
Brecht, he learned that a popular art form could advance the cause
of a communist utopia. (Benjamin's Jewish heritage, meanwhile, was
intensified by his long friendship with Gershom Scholem, a scholar
of the Kabbala and its tradition of mystical literature.)
</P>
<P>
   But the most important direct influence on ``The Arcades
Project'' came from Surrealism. From Surrealists, Benjamin acquired
the belief that social revolution and psychological analysis went
hand in hand. The liberation of society from ancient hierarchies;
the liberation of minds from self-imposed repression: Surrealists
like Breton considered these complementary pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed in historical context, ``The Arcades Project'' can be
seen as the great nonfiction epic of Surrealist literature.
Interweaving dreams and their analysis in a single text, the book
evokes the demented rationality that we associate with Borges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dada was the mother of Surrealism. Its father was the
arcade.'' Benjamin is referring to the Passage de l'Opera, an
arcade where the Surrealists had often gathered to discuss their
ideas. It would be more accurate to say that Surrealism and ``The
Arcades Project'' were both rooted in Haussmann's boulevards. Their
construction exposed the decrepit parts of Paris that had long been
hidden within the maze of medieval streets. Chaos spilled out into
plain view like secrets of the urban unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   Haussmann lined the new boulevards with endless dream factories
(theaters, cafes, department stores), adorning avenues that had
been designed to facilitate cannon fire and troop movement in case
of civil unrest. The results were a jarring mixture of pleasure and
fear, euphoria and paranoia, a Surrealist composition similar to
the one we see today in Rudolph Giuliani's New York.
</P>
<P>
   The arcades had grown shabby long before Benjamin came to Paris.
Haussmann's boulevards had reduced them to haunted ballrooms
populated by the ghosts of yesterday's fashions. Places dedicated
to the pursuit of novelty, the arcades were doomed by the desire
they inspired.
</P>
<P>
   But under Benjamin's eye, the faded arcade became something new
again: an intellectual reflection. Like the ruins of the Roman
forum in Goethe's day, the decaying arcade was a springboard for
his imagination.
</P>
<P>
   For Benjamin, the 20th century is trapped inside the previous
century's dream. By interpreting the dream, he hopes to rouse his
contemporaries from their collective slumber. The arcade is where
the dream was manufactured. Like the factories that produced the
wares sold there, the arcade was an industrial machine. It relied
on display, advertising, newspapers and the other new technologies
of consumer manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   The Passage des Panoramas (extant, though the three cylindrical
viewing chambers that gave the arcade its name are gone) represents
another kind of technology, which the critic Jonathan Crary has
called the ``techniques of the observer.'' Zoetropes,
kaleidoscopes, stereopticons: these optical devices performed a
function similar to that of contemporary painting and fiction. They
taught modern city dwellers how to perceive the larger panorama
that was taking shape around them. Through them, the urban
environment was transformed into a dazzling pattern of subjective
spaces.
</P>
<P>
   The arcade itself was a visual device: a spatial frame around
the shop windows that inspired passersby with the desire to
purchase la vie en rose. Behind the windows, novelties continuously
appear. Parisians regard themselves in the reflective glass.
Benjamin uses the word ``phantasmagoria'' to describe the dream
state in which the social contract is rewritten.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arcades Project'' is an Enlightenment project. By bringing
awareness to its readers, the book will release them from the hold
of manufactured states of mind.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty years after his death, the phantasmagoria has become even
more gripping. Industrial production has been shipped overseas. The
manipulation industries _ advertising, fashion, mass media, spin _
have extended their influence to global dimensions. The
19th-century dream has been carried over to the 21st. All of Paris
is an arcade, and many American cities have remade themselves as
shopping malls in order to survive. Cities are fun! Cities R Us!
And the streets are safer than ever!
</P>
<P>
   Why wake up? And how effective a wake-up call can a choppy,
overweight, 60-year-old book possibly be?
</P>
<P>
   In their introduction, the translators address a mystery that
has long been part of the book's appeal. Is ``The Arcades Project''
unfinished, or simply unwritten? In 1936 Benjamin professed to
Scholem that not a syllable of the text had yet been written. How
could it have been? The book had its genesis as a feuilleton story.
This grew into plans for an essay, for a book, for another book.
</P>
<P>
   By 1930 it had expanded to what he described as ``the theater of
all my struggles and all my ideas.'' Over time, the project mutated
into the literary equivalent of its subject: a discontinuous maze,
composed of brief insights and digressions, along with quotations
that glitter from the pages like wares in a shop window.
</P>
<P>
   One enters a maze to get lost, as Benjamin observed. Did he want
to find a way out? He's trying to hold all of 19th-century Paris in
his head _ its ideas, plastic art forms, merchandise, as well as
its buildings and streets. At the same time, he's trying to fashion
a new lens for bringing this bygone city into sharp, contemporary
focus.
</P>
<P>
   Given more time, he might well have rendered his encyclopedic
insights into seamless, panoramic prose. But the question of what
might have been has a power of its own. That mystery is congruent
with the enigmatic urban spectacle he set out to analyze. Of
necessity, the reader is transformed into an intellectual flaneur,
a stroller through an imagination so overcharged that Benjamin can
barely sort out his own thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arcades Project,'' itself a ruin, has served a similar
function for writers today. In a convolute on demolition sites,
Benjamin writes that such places make ideal ``sources for teaching
the theory of construction.'' With ``The Arcades Project,'' he
provided a model for succeeding generations of writers who have
transformed the city into a major chapter in the history of ideas.
If the urban center no longer holds, it can at least remain an
enduring focus for awareness.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   More ruins: Marx, Freud, Surrealism. We look back at ``The
Arcades Project'' through the wreckage of many ideological and
artistic movements, including the three that influenced Benjamin's
thought. The communist experiment has failed. Freud's assertions of
scientific method have been discredited. Surrealism is regarded as
a closed historical chapter. ``Away with these old ideas!''
</P>
<P>
   But the issues addressed by these movements have not
disappeared. Social inequity and warped personalities are no less
glaring in public life today. What has visibly diminished is the
will to increase public awareness of these problems and the
cultural forces that veil them. Our promised liberation from old
ideas, like the New Deal, is seldom more than a smoke screen to
cover the return of even older, less appetizing ideas. Oligarchy,
for example. Social Darwinism. Or the relegation of art to the
painting of curlicues on an unsavory status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Art was a stumbling block for Benjamin. Trapped within his
negative dialectic, beauty was a suspect concept. This skepticism
was shared by the Surrealists, who believed that they were making
anti-art. (The published form of his convolutes may be the ultimate
anti-book.) For Marxists, art was a fetish commodity. For
Freudians, it was an abnormality to be diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   But where, in this bleak pathological landscape, was Benjamin to
place the beauty of his own mind? Where, for that matter, was he to
place the beauty of the city that clearly intoxicated him? He may
have wished to awaken people from the dream of the 19th century. He
brutally exposed the social and psychological forces that had
shaped it. But could he honestly claim to be immune to the charms
of the dream city created by those forces?
</P>
<P>
   Are only writers allowed to be aware? Are painters,
photographers, fashion and interior designers forbidden to enlarge
the public's consciousness of its time and place? Are architects
doomed to constructing mazes for mice? Why spend all that time in
Paris? Why write a book? Could Benjamin ask himself such questions
without short-circuiting his brain? Could these contradictions be
the rocks on which ``The Arcades Project'' crashed?
</P>
<P>
   And yet, even if Benjamin found scant quarter for his own
artistic genius, his book casts a penetrating light into the art of
our time. Some of today's most creatively ambitious designs _
projects by Frank Gehry, Rem Koolhaas, Jean Nouvel, Diller and
Scofidio, Philippe Starck _ can be seen as late flowerings of
Surrealism, a movement seldom expressed in architecture up to now.
In them, we see reflections of the changes that have transpired in
the city since the waning of the Modern movement.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin's writings are even more useful in interpreting less
flamboyant contemporary work. The depth of meaning he saw in common
architectural forms _ thresholds, mirrors, lighting fixtures _ can
now be seen in the work of architects like Steven Holl, Henry Smith
Miller and Laurie Hawkinson, Tod Williams and Billie Tsien.
</P>
<P>
   In a building by Williams and Tsien, for example, a door is
seldom just a door, nor merely an abstract geometrical form. It is
also a social and psychological device that pivots us between our
outer and inner worlds. A threshold is a metaphoric as well as
literal boundary.
</P>
<P>
   Architecture critics poking around in Benjamin's ruin will
encounter a challenge of minotaurian proportions. Can we prove that
buildings amount to more than walls in a maze? That they are not
just instruments of public manipulation? Ordinarily, we don't even
try. We accept that most buildings are lies. We even embrace the
fantasies when they are told in entertaining style. In the few
moments that post-Modernism was clicking, some of us went along
with its grand charade of a return to classical tradition.
</P>
<P>
   But if we claim that some buildings more than others deserve to
be regarded as art, then the question of hierarchy arises. And with
it the issue of truth. Otherwise, how can hierarchical rankings be
sustained? Benjamin's negative dialectic provides the tools for
subjecting buildings to closer interrogation.
</P>
<P>
   In their own time, buildings by Sullivan, Wright, Mies van der
Rohe, Le Corbusier were esteemed because they bore at least a
contingent relationship to truth. Like Benjamin, they conducted a
negative dialectic, stripping away the fakery of revivalist styles.
We value work by Gehry and Koolhaas for similar reasons. In it, we
see a negation of modern architecture's claim to hard, objective
truth, and an enlargement of the subjective dimension that modern
architects kept under wraps.
</P>
<P>
   Would Benjamin have banned the light from Paris skies? The Jicky
perfume that gave the woman walking ahead of him on the boulevard
her indefinable allure? I doubt it. For a critic, this is the
ultimate negation. We take the dialectic as far as we can, then
surrender to beauty with relief.

TAINTED FOOD, WATER DRAWS COUNTY'S EYE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RYAN KONIG  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - Maricopa County has nearly three times the number of
illnesses caused by tainted food and water than a community of this
size should have, the county's top health official says.
</P>
<P>
   And two-thirds of those cases were never investigated because of
a lack of staff and money, says Dr. Jonathan Weisbuch, director of
the county's Department of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``The causes could be any one of a million things,'' he said,
ranging from improperly cooked meals in homes or businesses to
people not washing their hands before they prepare food or eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, we simply don't know the causes. And if we don't
know, then we can't do anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Weisbuch says the department needs more money, about
$130,000 from the county's general fund, this year to help pay for
an epidemiologist, a specially trained nurse and an investigator to
find out what's making so many people sick.
</P>
<P>
   The county Board of Supervisors could vote within 30 days on the
health department's requested budget increase, Chairman Andrew
Kunasek said.
</P>
<P>
   Maricopa County currently investigates about a third of the
4,000 annual reports of food-borne and water-borne illnesses. If
the additional funds are approved, Weisbuch said, the county would
be able to investigate most of the remaining cases.
</P>
<P>
   Among the cases that were investigated last year include a
September outbreak in which 500 county jail inmates suffered
nausea, stomach cramps and vomiting. Lab tests indicate the cause
may have been a tainted dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Another incident last year involved 21 people who became ill
after drinking unpasteurized orange juice blended by a Tempe-based
company. That company, Sun Orchard, stopped producing unpasteurized
orange juice.
</P>
<P>
   The caseload of 4,000 reported food- and water-borne illnesses
is nearly three times higher than it should be for a community of
this size, based on a recent study from the national Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Weisbuch said. The expected rate of
these illnesses is about 50 cases per 100,000 people, he said.
</P>
<P>
   By that count, the Phoenix area should have had 1,500 cases,
instead of 4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Weisbuch said the high number may be partly due to population
growth:
</P>
<P>
   ``We are adding 100,000 people every year to this community, and
1,000 new food businesses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   People new to the Phoenix area may need time to figure out how
to properly store or prepare foods that are more common to this
area, Weisbuch said. Even something as simple as leaving groceries
in a car for too long in the summer can foster bacteria growth to
unhealthful levels.
</P>
<P>
   Improper temperature is a leading cause of food contamination,
said David Ludwig, who is in charge of the food service inspections
division of Maricopa County Environmental Services.
</P>
<P>
   Some foods need to be heated to at least 190 degrees to kill off
bacteria. Others foods need to be stored at low temperatures to
curb growth of bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   There's a complicated set of heating and cooling procedures
needed for cooking, reheating, storing and serving different kinds
of foods, Ludwig said. Otherwise, bacteria could grow to the point
that they could cause illness. &QL;

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
SAN FRANCISCO _ Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich returned to the
visitors' locker room in Sacramento in a rush Tuesday and, with a
quick order, cleared out everyone but his players. By the time one
of the strangest moments of this odd season had echoed through the
halls, he had one less player.
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Rockets left Sacramento with their seventh consecutive
road loss, center Thomas Hamilton remained behind. He will be cut
today, having all but dared Tomjanovich to set him free from what
sources said he called his unfair persecution by the Rockets coach
in a long, loud and often incoherent soliloquy.
</P>
<P>
   In front of stunned teammates, sources said, Hamilton told
Tomjanovich, ``Do what you have to do.'' Now the ranks of healthy
centers on the Rockets' roster will be reduced solely to a player
signed to a 10-day contract last week,
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Rockets began searching for Hamilton's
replacement, and the team could add a player as soon as today.
Former Celtics and Clippers forward Marty Conlon, former Celtics
and Rockets center Eric Riley, and former Timberwolves center Bill
Curley are among players available.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's official release will end the Rockets' experiment
with a 7-2, 330-pound enigma whose potential had intrigued them but
gone untapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it was best for the team,'' said Tomjanovich, who would
offer little else about Hamilton's brief tenure with the Rockets or
Tuesday's last straw.
</P>
<P>
   But because he was determined to cut ties quickly, Tomjanovich
said he had to make the move despite the Rockets' injury woes at
center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been around the league a long time and have seen some
crazy things,'' forward Matt Bullard said, declining to discuss any
of the conversations in the postgame meeting. ``It's too bad he
(Hamilton) chose to do that. He's got some skills we can use. But
if you're not with the team mentally, you can't have that kind of
player. He had a great situation if he worked hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just weird, one of the strangest situations I've ever
seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's departure leaves a void in the middle nearly as large
as he is.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Rogers, forced to play center since Kelvin Cato sprained
his right wrist Dec. 30, sprained his right thumb Tuesday night. He
would have been unavailable tonight anyway because of the funeral
of a brother who died Saturday. He is questionable for Saturday's
game in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Hakeem Olajuwon isn't due back from hernia surgery until
Saturday at the earliest. Cato is not expected back until next
week. Tony Massenburg, out since Nov. 25 with a strained groin,
might not come back this season at all.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Anthony ``Pig'' Miller, signed to a 10-day contract
Jan. 6, as the only healthy center on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockets were only too happy to exchange a ``Pig'' for
``Big Ham'' after Tuesday's bizarre scene.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, 24, had shown previous dissatisfaction with his
often-limited role. But when Tomjanovich called Hamilton and four
other players into the game with four minutes left Tuesday,
Hamilton remained seated until Tomjanovich insisted he play. Once
in the game with Kings fans mocking him heartily, Hamilton seemed
angry and disinterested.
</P>
<P>
   First he failed to notice a pass from Shandon Anderson. Then,
when Hamilton failed to get a pass from Cuttino Mobley, he rolled
his eyes, looked at the ceiling and trudged out of the low post to
the free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich called time out and asked Hamilton, ``Do you want to
play?'' Failing to get an answer, Tomjanovich said, ``I asked you a
question.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton remained in the game. But though usually among the last
to dress and leave the locker room, he was dressed and meeting with
Tomjanovich minutes after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Hamilton screamed that Tomjanovich had singled him
out for criticism and not given him a fair chance. He was also said
to have complained about his recent lack of playing time.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, who had started seven of his 22 games, played 21
minutes last week against Miami, scoring seven points with seven
rebounds. But he was scoreless in three minutes against the Jazz on
Saturday and had two points and no rebounds in his four minutes
Tuesday. He averaged 3.7 points and 4.1 rebounds with the Rockets
this season.
</P>
<P>
   When he trained, Hamilton was said to be an extremely hard
worker and was considered among the Rockets' strongest players. But
he often fell off his conditioning program entirely.
</P>
<P>
   He had begun to develop a jump hook that Rockets vice president
Carroll Dawson had shown him and had said it would become a staple
of his game. But because of his weight, he was unable to match up
with quicker centers and struggled to get the elevation needed on
many shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets signed Hamilton to a two-year, $1.1 million
contract. But the second season was at the team's option.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing to see, because he really doesn't know how
much talent he has,'' Miller said. ``There's a lot he could bring
to the game. I've been in situations like him, going into games
with four minutes left. That's what the coaches look at, trying to
see how hard you're going to play those last four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess he was upset. He felt like he should have been in
there earlier. It's a messed-up situation, because he could have
helped us. He's a big fella. He's young. He lost a lot of weight
over the summer. It was starting to pay off for him. He just needed
to keep working.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's departure from the Rockets was the latest in a series
of brushes with opportunity that have not panned out. A 1993
graduate of Martin Luther King High School in Chicago, he went to
the University of Pittsburgh but left before he ever played college
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   He played 11 games for the Celtics late in the 1995-96 season,
averaging 2.3 points and two rebounds. He has also gone through
training camps with the Bulls, Heat and Raptors.
</P>
<P>
   He is six months into a 36-month probation after agreeing to a
plea bargain for possession of 40 grams of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's departure left the Rockets with only nine healthy
players, including two, Miller and Devin Gray, on 10-day contracts.
Miller, Bullard and Kenny Thomas are the only centers or power
forwards available tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough, man,'' Bullard said. ``You get tested in different
ways. This is sort of our test _ if we can stay together and stay
positive through everything. We've had unbelievable bad luck,
injuries, guys going down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're holding together great. Any other team would
have fallen apart. We're still upbeat, having fun. We're passing
the test so far.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is a test that grows more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to win,'' guard Steve Francis said. ``You can
see it in everybody's eyes. Everybody wants to win, and it's hard.
We're starting over again.''

U.S. DRAFT OF ISRAEL-SYRIA TREATY REPORTED IN ISRAELI NEWSPAPER 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An Israeli newspaper on Wednesday published what it
said was a draft peace treaty framed by the Clinton administration
for Israel and Syria, laying out marked differences between the two
sides on the most difficult issues of borders and security
arrangements, but also showing likely agreement on other matters.
</P>
<P>
   There were few surprises in the document, which appeared in
Haaretz. It was described on Wednesday night by diplomats familiar
with the negotiations as a working tool that was not intended to be
definitive.
</P>
<P>
   On the most vexing issue, the border between Syria and Israel,
the document contains in brackets each side's well-known views of
how and where the border should be.
</P>
<P>
   The document describes Syria's position as ``based on the June
4, 1967, line.'' This is a reference to the border at the time of
the 1967 war, when Israel seized the Golan Heights from Syria.
Israel's position is described as ``taking into account security
and other vital interests of the parties as well as legal
considerations of both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Another stark difference in the document, which has also been
well-known, is how an early-warning capability on Mount Hermon on
the Golan Heights would be operated. The core of the negotiations
have centered on whether Israel would be prepared to give up the
Golan Heights to Syria and, if Israel were to do that, how it could
ensure that its security would not be threatened.
</P>
<P>
   The draft treaty published on Wednesday says that the Israelis
want an early-warning ground station on Mount Hermon to be manned
``with an effective Israeli presence.'' On the other hand, the
document says, the Syrians want it ``operated by the United States
and France under their total auspices and responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Successive Israeli governments have insisted that an
early-warning system on Mount Hermon was a key ingredient of a
peace settlement and that it must be manned by Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The areas on which the two sides appeared to have agreed,
according to the document, centered on diplomatic areas. The draft
treaty says the two countries agree to end the state of war and
enter into ``honorable, friendly and good neighborly relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, the two sides ``will establish full diplomatic and
consular relations, including exchanges of resident ambassadors,''
the document says.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats stressed on Wednesday night that the document
represented the American negotiators' best understanding of each
side's position. It was intended for both sides to consider before
returning to the talks that are set to resume in Washington next
week.
</P>
<P>
   But the document as published in Haaretz was missing several
elements from a document that President Clinton gave to the Israeli
prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the Syrian foreign minister, Farouk
al-Shara, last Sunday night, the diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   A rough time line that had been included in that document was
not published, and the Israeli newspaper did not publish a
disclaimer that appeared on every page of the original, the
diplomats said. The disclaimer said that the document was intended
as a working tool and was not final.
</P>
<P>
   Another major area of disagreement in the document concerned the
demilitarized zone to be established on either side of the new
border.
</P>
<P>
   For the Israelis, the zone encompassed ``both the area from
which Israeli forces will be relocated and the existing area of
separation established under the Agreement on Disengagement between
Israel and Syrian Forces of May 31, 1974.'' For the Syrians, the
document said that the demilitarized zone would be ``of equal scope
on both sides of the border.''
</P>
<P>
   At the close of the talks, which were held in Shepherdstown,
W.Va., the Clinton administration said that the two sides had been
given a document devised by the American negotiators as a way of
identifying the gaps between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   Both Barak and Shara, were encouraged by Clinton to come back
with responses for the resumption of the talks next Tuesday. Both
the Israeli leader and the Syrian foreign minister had to return
home to test the temperature of their domestic constituencies. In
Israel, 100,000 people rallied against giving up the Golan Heights
on Monday night, and new public opinion polls show more resistance
to a peace plan with Syria than had been expected.
</P>
<P>
   Shara, who is representing the Syrian president, Hafez Assad,
returned home to consult with Assad, who is the decision maker on
the Syrian side.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has sought to keep the draft treaty
as tightly held as possible, though there were qualms that it would
finally leak out in the Israeli press. The American negotiators had
stressed that they were concerned that making the document public
would make already difficult negotiations much more difficult
because any change in position from the published text would sound
like a concession.
</P>
<P>
   At the time that American officials offered their ``working
paper,'' they said they were not laying out new proposals for
resolving the most difficult issues.

The Minnesota Vikings know what it's like to be the St. Louis Rams
right now.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A year ago, the Vikings were coming off a first-round playoff
bye after whipping up on opponents all season. They had the most
prolific offense the league had seen in years. Defenses weren't
even coming close as they surged to a 15-1 regular-season record.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Randall Cunningham, while certainly not new to the
league, was having a career season, and with Randy Moss and Cris
Carter as targets, it seemed the Vikings couldn't be beaten.
</P>
<P>
   Until they ran into Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Vikings hope to pull an Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be a motivational factor for them,'' said St. Louis
coach Dick Vermeil, whose team will host Minnesota in a divisional
playoff game Sunday. ``They got so close and were so dominating,
and then they didn't get it done. I think our team would feel the
same way. That sticks with you for a long time. You never lose that
or erase that thought. It's got to be a motivator for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Vikings scored an NFL-record 556 points. The
rate of production slowed this year, but the Vikings still finished
third in the NFL in yards and fifth in scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Vikings have a lot of firepower on offense, and so do
we,'' Rams vice president of personnel Charley Armey said. ``The
Vikings have a lot of weapons, just like we do. You're going to
have two teams with great speed on that field. It really should be
something to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings think they're better equipped to pull an upset than
even the Falcons were last year. The Vikings are a more
well-balanced team than they were last season, with running back
Robert Smith running as well as ever. Smith, who played much of the
early season with a double hernia before missing three games after
surgery, was named the NFL's Offensive Player of the Week after
rushing for 140 yards and catching three passes for 58 yards and a
touchdown in Minnesota's wild-card victory over Dallas on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   When teams double-team Moss or Carter, the Vikings have found a
way to get the ball into Smith's hands, be it via a screen pass or
a running play.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have receivers like this, it's hard not to try to get
them the ball,'' Smith conceded. ``I don't remember any stretch in
my career where I've gotten the ball 20, 25 times so many games in
a row.''
</P>
<P>
   Four times in the last five weeks, the Vikings have run more
than they've passed. During that span, Smith has averaged 111 yards
on 21 rushes, a 5.3-yard average.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our style of play has moved more toward two tight ends and
more toward the run formation over the last four games,'' Minnesota
coach Dennis Green said. ``We think that's really our biggest
weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   That's hard to believe with a team that features one of the most
prolific receiving tandems in NFL history in Moss and Carter, but
perhaps Minnesota is taking a cue from the Falcons. Atlanta's
strategy last year was to run the ball, and the clock, keeping
Minnesota's explosive offense on the sideline as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the Rams) could be the Vikings of '98,'' Moss said.
``But some bad things happened to the Vikings of '98.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings are hoping the more balanced attack they used to
beat the Cowboys will add a dimension they didn't show when they
faced Atlanta last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sent out an alert,'' Vermeil said. ``We saw how well
Minnesota can run the ball against a good defensive front.
Obviously, Dallas was playing a seven-man front and
(double-covered) those receivers, so they weren't including the
safeties in run defense. But Smith did a heck of a job. They really
beat them running the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   This St. Louis team has no playoff experience, and the Vikings
are hoping that will give them an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's far more pressure than you've been under, and you do
get nervous, and you do have anxiety, and you do have concerns,''
Carter said. ``The only teams that say experience is not vital are
the teams that don't have any.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a process that Dallas went through with San Francisco.
It's a process that Green Bay went through with Dallas. It's a
process that we went through with Green Bay and also that Denver
went through. And all those teams, they had experience. And if you
look at last year's Super Bowl, I think that Denver's experience
outweighed Atlanta's.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Falcons also proved last year that an underdog can come
in and steal a game in a hostile arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, a lot of people are going to use that against St.
Louis, and I'm sure they're tired of hearing about it,'' Smith
said. ``They're tired of hearing about how they don't have
experience, how they didn't play anybody in the regular season, all
those things. To me, they don't mean a whole lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole new season. They've got talented players. We've
got talented players. It's time to suit up and play and let
everybody else on the outside worry about what's going to happen in
the game.''

FOR YORK, MAGIC NUMBER IS SEVEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ Today, jockey Ray York makes history. If all
goes right, the 66-year-old resident of Taft will hop aboard
Culebra in the eighth race at Santa Anita and become the first
jockey to ride in seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait,'' York said. ``It's going to be fun.''
</P>
<P>
   York, who rode his first race in June, 1949, as a 15-year-old
fresh off the farm, entered the Southern California racing scene at
the same time as the legendary Bill Shoemaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually rode my first race when I was still 15,'' York said
in a recent interview. ``I never thought I'd be riding
thoroughbreds, I wanted to be a cowboy.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of rounding up cattle, York rounded up wins on the race
circuit. In his career, he won 3,082 races, including the 1954
Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Derby was one of the greatest thrills of my life,'' York
said. ``I probably could have done better (in my career), but I
didn't have any brains at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   __ The weekend: Saturday's $300,000 Grade II San Fernando
Breeder's Cup Handicap could attract seven or more horses.
</P>
<P>
   Among those expected to run in the 1 1/16-mile event is Cat
Thief, winner of the Breeders' Cup Classic. Not to be overlooked,
though, are the Bob Baffert-trained General Challenge and Straight
Man or John Shirreffs' Cliquot among others.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert, for one, is confident about his chances Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe (General Challenge's) win in the Native Diver is a sign
of things to come,'' Baffert said. ``This horse is just so
talented. He's earned $1.6 million just fooling around. ''
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Baffert, who turns 47 today, said Wednesday he plans
to run Kentucky Derby prospect Captain Steve in the Jan. 30 Santa
Catalina Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   __ The one to catch: Entering Wednesday's races, jockey Kent
Desormeaux remained in the top spot among Santa Anita riders.
Desormeaux had 14 winners, followed by Patrick Valenzuela and David
Flores with 10 each.
</P>
<P>
   Among trainers, Baffert led the pack with seven wins. Ron
McAnally was in second place with six.

U.S. DRAFT OF ISRAEL-SYRIA TREATY REPORTED IN ISRAELI NEWSPAPER 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs to change time element throughout story; subs lead graf to
change wording, other small editing changes throughout) 
 (sw) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An Israeli newspaper on Thursday published what it
said was a draft peace treaty framed by the Clinton administration
for Israel and Syria, laying out marked differences between the two
sides on the most difficult issues of borders and security.
</P>
<P>
   There were few surprises in the document, which appeared in
Haaretz. It was described on Thursday night by diplomats familiar
with the negotiations as a working tool that was not intended to be
definitive.
</P>
<P>
   On the most vexing issue, the border between Syria and Israel,
the document contains in brackets each side's well-known views of
how and where the border should be.
</P>
<P>
   The document describes Syria's position as ``based on the June
4, 1967, line.'' This is a reference to the border at the time of
the 1967 war, when Israel seized the Golan Heights from Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's position is described as ``taking into account security
and other vital interests of the parties as well as legal
considerations of both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Another stark difference in the document, which has also been
well-known, is how an early-warning station on Mount Hermon in the
Golan Heights would be operated. The core of the negotiations have
centered on whether Israel would be prepared to give up the Golan
Heights to Syria and, if Israel were to do that, how it could
ensure that its security would not be threatened.
</P>
<P>
   The draft treaty published on Thursday says that the Israelis
want an early-warning ground station on Mount Hermon to be manned
``with an effective Israeli presence.'' On the other hand, the
document says, the Syrians want it ``operated by the United States
and France under their total auspices and responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Successive Israeli governments have insisted that an
early-warning system on Mount Hermon was a key ingredient of a
peace settlement and that it must be manned by Israel.
</P>
<P>
   If the security conflicts can be resolved, the document points
to diplomatic actions that would be included in a treaty. It says
the countries would agree to end their state of war and enter into
``honorable, friendly and good neighborly relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, both would ``establish full diplomatic and consular
relations, including exchanges of resident ambassadors,'' the
document says.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats stressed on Wednesday night that the document
represented the American negotiators' best understanding of each
side's position. It was intended for both sides to consider before
returning to the talks that are set to resume in Washington next
week.
</P>
<P>
   But the document as published in Haaretz was missing several
elements from a document that President Clinton gave to the Israeli
prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the Syrian foreign minister, Farouk
al-Shara, last Sunday night, the diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   A rough timeline that had been included in that document was not
published, and the Israeli newspaper did not publish a disclaimer
that appeared on every page of the original, the diplomats said.
The disclaimer said that the document was intended as a working
tool and was not final.
</P>
<P>
   Another area of disagreement in the document concerned the
demilitarized zone to be established on either side of the new
border.
</P>
<P>
   For the Israelis, the zone encompassed ``both the area from
which Israeli forces will be relocated and the existing area of
separation established under the Agreement on Disengagement between
Israel and Syrian Forces of May 31, 1974.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Syrians, the document said that the demilitarized zone
would be ``of equal scope on both sides of the border.''
</P>
<P>
   At the close of the talks, which were held in Shepherdstown,
W.Va., the Clinton administration said that the two sides had been
given a document devised by the American negotiators as a way of
identifying the gaps between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   Both Barak and Shara were encouraged by Clinton to come back
with responses for the resumption of the talks next Wednesday. Both
the Israeli leader and the Syrian foreign minister had to return
home to test the temperature of their domestic constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, more than 100,000 people rallied against giving up
the Golan Heights on Monday night, and new public opinion polls
show more resistance to a peace plan with Syria than had been
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Shara, who is representing the Syrian president, Hafez Assad,
returned home to consult with Assad, who is the decision maker on
the Syrian side.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has sought to hold the draft treaty
as tightly as possible, though there were qualms that it would
finally leak out in the Israeli press. The American negotiators had
stressed that they were concerned that making the document public
would make already stressful negotiations much more difficult
because any change in position from the published text would sound
like a concession.
</P>
<P>
   At the time that American officials offered their ``working
paper,'' they said they were not laying out new proposals for
resolving the toughest issues. They said such proposals would be
counterproductive so early.

2000 GOLF SEASON ROARS IN WITH FULL COURSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new season in professional golf is in full swing with some
familiar faces in new places, as well as some old reliables trying
to top past achievements.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods, who concluded last season with four consecutive
victories, built on his record-setting success from 1999 in
Sunday's final round of the Mercedes Championships. With his
victory, Woods, 24, became the first golfer in 52 years to win five
consecutive PGA Tour events. The only golfers to post longer
winning streaks are two Fort Worth legends, Byron Nelson (11 in
1945) and Ben Hogan (six in 1948).
</P>
<P>
   While Woods tries to approach his tour-best totals of eight
victories and $6.6 million in earnings from last season, two Texans
who combined for 40 career victories as PGA Tour participants will
move on to the next level. Lanny Wadkins and Tom Kite will be
rookies this season on the Senior PGA Tour. Both turned 50 in
December and are eligible to begin competition in the first
full-field event of the season, the Royal Caribbean Classic (Feb.
4-6).
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the home courses of the MasterCard Colonial and GTE
Byron Nelson Classic have undergone some off-season tweaks to make
them more challenging for PGA Tour participants in May.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the faces and places worth tracking in the
professional golf world in 2000:
</P>
<P>
   Inside the numbers
0 _ Tournaments in Fort Worth-Dallas on the 2000 LPGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   3 _ Tournaments in Fort Worth-Dallas on the 2000 PGA or Senior
PGA tours.
</P>
<P>
   7 _ Tournaments in Texas on the 2000 PGA, Senior PGA or LPGA
tours.
</P>
<P>
   8 _ Victories by Tiger Woods in 1999, most on the PGA Tour in 25
years.
</P>
<P>
   9 _ Texans ranked among the top 75 players in the world golf
rankings, including Southlake resident Brandt Jobe (No. 62).
</P>
<P>
   13 _ Players from Tarrant County competing on the PGA, Senior
PGA, LPGA or Buy.com tours.
</P>
<P>
   15 _ Texans with LPGA Tour cards.
</P>
<P>
   34 _ Texans with Buy.com Tour cards.
</P>
<P>
   35 _ Texans with PGA Tour cards.
</P>
<P>
   35 _ Texans with Senior PGA Tour cards.
</P>
<P>
   50 _ Events on the 2000 PGA Tour schedule.
</P>
<P>
   $1.4 million _ Prize money at the Bank One Championship (Sept.
22-24, Dallas).
</P>
<P>
   $3.3 million _ Prize money at the MasterCard Colonial (May
18-21, Fort Worth).
</P>
<P>
   $3.5 million _ Prize money at the GTE Byron Nelson Classic (May
11-14, Irving).
</P>
<P>
   $8.2 million _ Combined prize money at tours in Fort
Worth-Dallas.
National story lines
1. Topping the latest Tiger tale. Tiger Woods won eight PGA Tour
events last season, the most in 25 years. He earned $6,616,585, a
single-season record that almost doubled runner-up David Duval's
total ($3.64 million). In 1999, Woods also won his second major
championship (PGA), contributed to the greatest comeback victory in
Ryder Cup history and celebrated his 24th birthday. He began this
season with his fifth consecutive victory, behind only Ben Hogan
(6) and Byron Nelson (11) on the consecutive victories list. What
does Woods do for an encore? Is an encore possible?
</P>
<P>
   2. LPGA Tour celebrates its 50th anniversary. It stands as the
longest-running women's professional sports organization in the
world. A yearlong celebration begins with tomorrow's ``LPGA Night
of Champions'' dinner honoring the organization's 13 founders in
conjunction with the season-opening event, The Office Depot
Championship (today through Sunday), in West Palm Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   3. Great venues make for great championships (hopefully). Three
of the four major championships will be contested on some of the
world's most hallowed courses. In addition to the Masters
Tournament at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Ga., the U.S.
Open returns to Pebble Beach Golf Links in California, and the
British Open will be played at St. Andrews, the birthplace of golf.
</P>
<P>
   4. Rookies ready to rock Senior PGA Tour. Tom Kite and Lanny
Wadkins, who combined for 40 victories and two major championships
as PGA Tour competitors, join the 50-and-over circuit this season.
Tom Watson, a 34-event winner and eight-time major champion on the
PGA Tour, will spend his first full season on the Senior Tour after
becoming eligible in September.
</P>
<P>
   5. Casey Martin rolls on. By finishing in the top 15 on last
year's Nike Tour (now Buy.com Tour), the golfer, who has a physical
disability, earned full-time playing privileges on the PGA Tour in
2000. That means his golf cart could be headed to Colonial ...
unless an appeals court overturns the ruling that allowed him to
use the cart in competition, beginning in 1998. A ruling from the
appeals court is expected within the next two months. Martin has
said his physical condition (a circulatory disorder in his right
leg) has worsened to the point that walking 72 holes over four days
no longer is an option.
Tarrant County story lines
1. Mark Brooks returns to the scene of his greatest triumph.
Brooks, a Fort Worth resident, won the 1996 PGA Championship at
Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Ky., by beating Kenny Perry in a
sudden-death playoff. It stands as the only major championship won
by a Tarrant Country resident since Ben Hogan prevailed at the 1953
British Open. The PGA Championship returns to Valhalla (Aug. 17-20)
for the first time since Brooks' victory, and Brooks is exempt into
the field.
</P>
<P>
   2. John Grace's world tour. Grace, a Fort Worth resident, is a
nonexempt member of the Senior PGA Tour. But he has an exemption on
the European Senior Tour, largely because of strong finishes at the
1999 British Senior Open (12th) and 1999 Energis Senior Masters
(seventh). Grace plans to hone his game overseas, as much as time
and finances will allow, in hopes of landing a full-time berth on
the U.S. circuit in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   3. Greg Gregory's big chance. Gregory, a Burleson resident and
former UT-Arlington player who has been a regular on Texas-based
minitours in recent years, earned playing privileges on the Buy.com
Tour. It marks the first time that Gregory, 26, has had the
opportunity to compete regularly on one of the country's two
largest professional golf tours. Gregory caught the eye of local
golf fans by qualifying to compete in the 1999 U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   4. Hunter Haas gets his Masters moment. Haas, a Fort Worth
resident, earned a spot in the 2000 Masters by winning the 1999
U.S. Amateur Public Links Championship. Haas, the 1998 Big 12
individual champ while playing at Oklahoma, also reached the
semifinals of the 1999 U.S. Amateur. As part of his Masters
experience, Haas has lined up a practice round with Arnold Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   5. Colonial toughens its course. As part of a $4.5 million
renovation project announced in 1998, Colonial Country Club
officials have rebuilt all 18 greens and more than 80 bunkers since
the final putt dropped at the 1999 MasterCard Colonial. In
addition, the championship tees were pushed back at hole Nos. 9 and
14, six new fairway bunkers were added and 70 new trees were
planted. Officials at the GTE Byron Nelson Classic have tweaked the
TPC Las Colinas course as well, with tees lengthened at the sixth,
10th and 15th holes for the 2000 event. In addition, 1,500 new
trees have been planted and spectator mounts have been built to the
right of the 17th hole.
International story lines
1. Sergio Garcia's globetrotting. The Spanish teen-ager, who
finished second to Tiger Woods at the 1999 PGA Championship, earned
playing privileges on both the PGA Tour and European Tour for the
2000 season. Garcia, 19, said he plans to compete on both tours in
his first full season as a professional.
</P>
<P>
   2. Grace Park's expectations. A native of South Korea who won
the 1999 NCAA individual championship at Arizona State, Park will
be a 20-year-old rookie on the LPGA Tour. The last 20-year-old
rookie from South Korea was Se Ri Pak, who won two majors in her
inaugural season (1998). In the estimation of peers, Park may be a
more complete player at 20 than Pak.
</P>
<P>
   3. Karrie Webb's defense of her Triple Crown. Webb, a native of
Australia, set LPGA records for season earnings ($1,591,959) and
lowest season scoring average (69.43) in 1999. By winning six times
and posting 22 top-10 finishes, she also accumulated more points
(337.29) while winning the Rolex Player of the Year Award than any
predecessor. Webb, 25, also won her first major championship (du
Maurier Classic). What does she do for an encore?
</P>
<P>
   4. Memories beckon at British Open. Because of the calendar and
the location, officials at the 2000 British Open at St. Andrews
have encouraged as many past champions as possible to return for
one final farewell at the turn of the century. Jack Nicklaus and
Lee Trevino, among others, are expected to take part. Arnold Palmer
said he is considering a trip to St. Andrews, but has no plans to
attend at present.
</P>
<P>
   5. In pursuit of 58. Until May 1998, only two rounds of 59 had
been recorded in the history of professional golf. Since then,
we've had three. The most recent was David Duval's 59 during the
final round of the 1999 Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, which sealed a
comeback victory. Can 58 be far behind? If so, who will be the
first to do it?
</P>

   JAPAN-NUKE (Tokyo) _ More than any previous event in a history
full of serious mishaps, the nuclear accident in Japan last fall
rattled the coalition between industry and government that has long
made Japan the world's most ambitious user of nuclear energy.
Strikingly, in a country known for its political quiescence, the
sharp movement of public opinion against nuclear power has taken
the form of a genuine groundswell. By Howard W. French.

the economy, this year they seem relatively content. That leaves
them the luxury of tuning their political antenna on the personal

pueblo, about 35 miles northwest of Albuquerque has been using the
symbol since the year 1200, tribal officials say. And now the
pueblo has asked the state of New Mexico to pay it $74 million in
compensation for employing without permission what the tribe's

HALL OF FAMER LEMON DIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Bob Lemon, who went from the playgrounds of
Long Beach to baseball's Hall of Fame, died Monday night at a
convalescent hospital. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon won 207 games and two more in the 1948 World Series during
his 14-year pitching career with the Cleveland Indians, and was
elected into the Hall of Fame in 1976. He managed in parts of eight
seasons in the majors, including the 1978 New York Yankees, who
came from 14 games behind Boston to a memorable World Series title.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon suffered a stroke in December of 1998 and two more last
year, the last in November. He is survived by his wife, Jane, and
two sons, Jeff and Jim. Funeral arrangements are pending.
</P>
<P>
   ``During his prime, he was as good if not better than any
pitcher in baseball,'' said baseball legend Bob Feller, his Indians
teammate and fellow Hall of Famer. ``He was a great friend and an
even greater person.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was our hero,'' said Jack Newman, who saw Lemon play at
Wilson High of Long Beach and helped organize a monthly gathering
of old Long Beach baseball stars and fans that Lemon would attend.
``Everyone in my age group saw Bob play or played with him, and
followed his career with a passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an extremely modest man who you could never get to talk
about all the things he had achieved. He was as down to earth as
any man you'd ever meet.''
</P>
<P>
   A standout third baseman at Wilson in the late '30s, he was
named Southern California high school Player of the Year in 1938
and signed with the Cleveland Indians out of high school for $300.
</P>
<P>
   He made a brief stop in the major leagues with the Indians in
1941 and 1942 as a third baseman before spending the next three
years in the Navy, where he played, and pitched, on service teams
in Los Alamitos and Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to the Indians in 194, and was the center fielder
for them in an April game against the Yankees. He made a diving
catch to save a hit and a run in what would become Feller's second
no-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a great fielder,'' said Feller. ``He just never hit
very well. He actually was a better hitter as a pitcher. I wasn't
surprised when he became a pitcher, because I knew he had a good
arm and heard he was pitching in the Navy.''
</P>
<P>
   A variety of baseball people are credited with Lemon's
transition to pitching Indians shortstop and manager Lou Boudreau,
catchers Birdie Tebbetts and Al Lopez, former manager Bill
McKechnie, infielders and fellow Navy men Billy Herman and Johnny
Pesky, and Indians pitcher Mel Harder, whom Lemon credits with
teaching him the curve.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon made the move to the mound for good in 1947, winning 11
games, and became a starter full-time in 1948, at the age of 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a great arm, he wanted to learn, and he worked very
hard to become a pitcher,'' said Boudreau, his Indians manager.
``He had a natural sinker and he used that to his advantage on a
team that was very good defensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't the strikeout pitcher like Feller, but he got people
out. And he was a good hitter as a pitcher. He kept himself in a
lot of ballgames because he could hit.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, Lemon had his first of seven 20-win seasons, leading
the American League in innings (293), complete games (20) and
shutouts (10).
</P>
<P>
   Between 1948 and 1956, Lemon won 188 games, completed 179 of his
312 starts, and was named to the AL All-Star team seven times.
Those numbers don't really do him justice, however. The core of his
career came before baseball had created the Cy Young Award (1956)
to honor the top pitcher in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon also hit 37 career home runs, one behind the all-time
pitchers' record of 38 by Wes Farrell, and seven in one season
(1949). His career average as a pinch-hitter was .284.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon appeared in two World Series, winning two games in the
Indians' six-game 1948 triumph, the last title for the franchise,
and losing two in 1954. That season, the Indians won 111 games but
lost four straight to the New York Yankees in the World Series.
Lemon was the Indians pitcher in Game 1, which was marked by Willie
Mays' catch of a Vic Wertz drive to the deepest part of the Polo
Grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon retired in 1958, then returned to baseball as a coach and
front-office official with the Indians (1960), Phillies (1961) and
Angels (1962-68).
</P>
<P>
   Lemon got his first opportunity to manage with the Kansas City
Royals in 1970, went 85-76 in 1971, but was fired in 1972. He
managed the Chicago White Sox in 1977, going 90-72, but was fired
at midseason a year later.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs broadcaster Steve Stone was on that 1977 team. ``Lem was a
pretty easy-going guy who, because he'd been through the wars, gave
pitchers the benefit of the doubt. If you couldn't play for Bob,
you couldn't play for anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   His firing in Chicago allowed him to be hired to replace Billy
Martin during one of the Yankees' more chaotic seasons. George
Steinbrenner had already gone through Martin and Dick Howser before
tapping Lemon.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees went 48-20 under Lemon, making up a 14-game gap on
Boston, winning a one-game playoff, beating Kansas City in the
ALCS, and then finishing off the Dodgers in six games of the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``When our team was going through the turmoil (1978), Bob was
just what we needed,'' said Steinbrenner in a statement. ``He was
such a calming influence . . . he guided the club to the world
championship in one of the greatest comebacks in sports history. He
was a gentle man but a consummate competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemon managed parts of three more seasons for the Yankees and
remained an official paid scout for the Yankees up until his
passing.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon's life was touched by one giant tragedy. The youngest of
his three sons, Jerry, was killed in November of 1978 in a one-car
accident while driving to Arizona to visit his brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he ever recovered from his son's death,'' said
Feller. ``I would see him every year at Cooperstown (during the
induction ceremonies), but he was really hurt by that.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of Lemon's last interviews, with Long Beach
Press-Telegram columnist Doug Krikorian, before his stroke in 1998,
he assessed his life and career in simple terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``How am I doing? I'm soon going to be 78. I'm an old man. I'm
soon going to die. But life's been good to me. Been married to the
same lady for 54 years. Been living in the same house since 1949.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy. I meet with my old cronies once a month. I love
this town.'' Any regrets? ``Nah. Had a good life. It's been like a
storybook. No regrets.'' &QL;

RICE STUNNED BY DEATH OF EX-TEAMMATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Glen Rice, his eyes red and his voice low, said he
was stunned Wednesday morning by the news that former Charlotte
Hornets teammate Bobby Phills had been killed in an auto accident.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Phil Jackson delivered the news to the Los Angeles Lakers
at their morning shootaround, and no one was more deeply affected
than Rice, who played alongside Phills for the 1997-98 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm basically still in shock, pretty much,'' Rice said before
tipoffagainst the Milwaukee Bucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were close. Bobby was the type of individual that was hard
not beclose to. He was a very friendly, very outgoing, very caring
individual. It's just, it's just sad when things like that happen
to good people, you know. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``(Phills) was one of the players that you could really say that
he thought of other people before he thought of himself, always put
other people in front of himself, a guy that was dedicated not only
on the basketball floor, but inside the community. He was
definitely one of the guys in the NBA that was a first-class
person.''
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old Phills died Wednesday morning, the result of a
three-car collision that occurred on his way home from a
shootaround in Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems really freakish,'' Rice said. ``That's a road that
former (Hornets) players like myself, we've all driven down time
after time, again and again. It's... It's very unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice spoke with former teammate Matt Geiger, now playing for the
Philadelphia 76ers, but he had not yet phoned Phills' family.
</P>
<P>
   It was just last Friday that Rice and Phills chatted in L.A.,
before their teams played, and made plans to have their families
get together next month, when the Lakers play in Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and his wife, they talked about the babies, we both
just hadbabies eight to 10 months ago. We talked about when we go
down to play Charlotte getting together and getting the babies
together. It's going to be sad that he's not going to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Ouch report: Robert Horry is day-to-day after suffering a
broken nose in the fourth quarter Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Horry caught a Tim Thomas elbow with 6:40 remaining and went to
the locker room with a bloody nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually I get out of the way. He (moved) so quick that I
couldn't get out of the way,'' Horry said. ``It wasn't on purpose.
He just turned around and I got caught.''
</P>
<P>
   Horry said he expects to play Friday at Indiana.

TROJANS MAKE MEANINGFUL STATEMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC coach Henry Bibby downplaying the magnitude of
his basketball team's game against UCLA on Wednesday was
disingenuous. It'd be like his former Knicks teammate Bill Bradley
minimizing the importance of the presidential primary in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the games contested in March matter more than a city
grudge match that takes place before President's weekend. But first
things first. If you want to rule the conference, it's highly
advisable to hold sway in your own city.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA had gerrymandered L.A. The time was at hand for the Trojans
to grow their constituency, mobilize local recruits and generate a
little buzz beyond their backyard.
</P>
<P>
   Enough posturing and promises, already. The Trojans' grass-roots
campaign needed to take seed at the Sports Arena in front of a
plainly partisan crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby's mandate as campaign manager, er, coach was to make his
team believe it was the alpha male. He went about it in his own
brusque way _ not by spouting bromides or courting reporters but by
staying well outside the spotlight, the better to focus on infusing
his players with confidence in one another and themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The highest compliment that can be paid Bibby is he had his team
ready. The Trojans came out higher than a helium balloon and took
their collective game to another level. They played as though the
rest of their season was resting on the result.
</P>
<P>
   The way they hustled and hammered away at the Bruins, you would
have thought the polls were closing at the stroke of midnight and
this was their final chance to make a winning first impression.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA, meantime, looked unprepared from before the opening tip.
The Bruins arrived 28 minutes before the game's scheduled start
after getting stuck in traffic for the soccer friendly between
Mexico and Guadalajara taking place next door at the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   The interminable 10-mile drive from the Westwood campus must
have sapped the Bruins of their concentration. They shuffled
through the game like it was a fast-food stopover on the way to the
airport and a more prestigious national date with North Carolina on
Saturday in Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   But enough about the looosing team, to borrow from a UCLA
student section chant.
</P>
<P>
   USC's 91-79 victory was big, as rousing a stump speech for the
rest of the country's ears as the one Auburn had delivered the
night before when it beat Kentucky for the first time in 15
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers had gone a decade between wins over the Wildcats. The
Trojans' losing streak to UCLA was a mere 10 games but stretched to
cover Bibby's tenure like an air-tight tarpaulin.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans were loath to admit it beforehand, but they were
suffocating under the weight of all those losses. Going into
Wednesday's game, they had every reason to feel like the actors in
the ABC sitcom ``Sports Night''; they had put forth some
substantive performances but few people seemed to be taking much
notice.
</P>
<P>
   That the Trojans (10-5; 3-0) had started the day deadlocked with
Arizona for the Pacific-10 lead wouldn't have meant a thing if they
didn't ring in a new day there, at the Bruins' expense.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't going to be as easy as it seemed. The Bruins (9-4;
1-2) may have staggered out of the gate this season but they have
that staggering history. It works for them like a stiff wind at
their backs.
</P>
<P>
   The first time USC center Brian Scalabrine played the Bruins,
last year, he looked at their jerseys and saw those 11 championship
banners. ``I was in awe,'' he recalled before the game. ``I was
like, wow, this is UCLA.''
</P>
<P>
   And the second time around?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm over that,'' Scalabrine said. ``They definitely have
All-Americans. But I'm from America, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Touche. Scalabrine parried with the Bruins' vaunted frontcourt
of Jerome Moiso and Dan Gadzuric all night. He crashed the
defensive boards so hard, it's a wonder UCLA got any second shots
at all.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins got only two offensive rebounds in the first half.
The Trojans, led by Jeff Trepagnier's seven rebounds and
Scalabrine's five defensive boards, outrebounded UCLA 28-10 on
their way to a 13-point lead at intermission.
</P>
<P>
   That's just extra effort. Of course, it helps to have
Trepagnier, the human pogo stick, on your side. Bibby marvels at
the junior guard's boundless energy reserves and his first bounce
(step is too bland a term) to the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never gets tired,'' Bibby said of Trepagnier, who
contributed 26 points, 10 rebounds and three steals in 39 minutes.
``He could play 50 minutes and play another game after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Given their druthers, all the Trojans would gladly return to the
Sports Arena today and take on Arizona State instead of waiting a
week to bring down the House (Eddie, that is). When you're for
real, you don't want to sit around cooling your heels.

BRUINS ARE LATE, LETHARGIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The UCLA Bruins misjudged traffic and arrived at
the Sports Arena a scant 30 minutes before tipoff _ approximately
45 minutes later than usual.
</P>
<P>
   They shouldn't have come at all.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were outted Wednesday in a 91-79 loss to USC _
outplayed, outhustled, and outcoached.
</P>
<P>
   It was their first city series loss since 1994 and their worst
since 1986, and they have just two days to recover before playing
North Carolina in the Dean Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently unaware the Mexican Olympic soccer team was playing
at the Coliseum at 7 p.m., the Bruins left Westwood at their
regular time and got stuck in brutal traffic as they approached
USC's campus.
</P>
<P>
   They usually arrive about 75 minutes before tipoff for road
games. Wednesday, they reached the Sports Arena 30 minutes before
tip _ just enough time to stretch and take a few shots.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the cause was traffic, lethargy or poor preparation, the
Bruins were not ready to play. They were confused by USC's changing
defenses and repeatedly failed to box out the high-flying Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   But UCLA's biggest problem was an ill-prepared defense that
allowed USC to score at will. The Bruins played like they'd never
seen Brian Scalabrine pass to Sam Clancy in the post, yet it was
USC's regular offense.
</P>
<P>
   From first whistle to last, UCLA seemed surprised by USC's
aggressiveness, but it shouldn't have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half their guys wanted to come (to UCLA),'' Bruins freshman
Jason Kapono said before the game. ``They'll be fired up. They'll
be ready to ball, and we have to match that. They'll be thinking,
`Since the Bruins lost to Washington by two and we beat Washington,
that must mean we're better.'
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be jacked up, sitting in first place. They'll be
pumped up. Their fan support will grow from 20 to 6,000.''
</P>
<P>
   USC was a slight favorite before tipoff, with just cause. The
Trojans had won six of their previous seven and swept the
Washington schools, while UCLA has struggled for weeks and lost in
Seattle in the final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Favorite, underdog, success or failure in Seattle _ it mattered
not to UCLA. Its gaze, supposedly, was on first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go to UCLA and you're not excited to play USC,
something's wrong,'' Bruins forward Sean Farnham said before the
game. ``The fact that they're 2-0 brings something (extra) to it,
not the fact they beat Washington and Washington State.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins (9-4, 1-2) couldn't afford to lose Wednesday, fall
two games behind Arizona and retain a reasonable chance to win the
Pac-10 title. They lost a game they shouldn't have (Washington) and
now must get it back by beating a top team on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the conference, anywhere you can win on the road, that
gives you a distinct advantage,'' coach Steve Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   But UCLA has a more immediate problem: qualifying for the NCAA
Tournament. It needs 18 victories to secure an at-large berth, but
that's tougher than it seems: six of its 17 games remaining are
against Arizona (twice), Stanford (twice), North Carolina and
Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   If the Bruins were to lose all six _ not unreasonable, given the
way they're playing _ they must win nine of the remaining 11. That
won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has a long way to go in terms of playing to our
ability,'' Lavin said.

THE BUCKS CAN'T STOP 'EM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ They are nearly halfway to reaching an unreachable
record, and 35 days removed from their last loss, yet the Los
Angeles Lakers march onlike a team that has no peer, still looking
for someone to challenge their preeminence.
</P>
<P>
   Another presumed obstacle the high-powered, high-scoring
Milwaukee Bucks fell to the wayside Wednesday night, and the Lakers
simply zoomed on, pocketing their 16th straight win 103-94 at the
Bradley Center.
</P>
<P>
   A fun little streak that once served as an innocuous
conversation piece is now taking on serious proportions
</P>
<P>
   tying the second-longest winning streak in franchise history,
and moving the Lakers within a mere 17 victories of the NBA record.
</P>
<P>
   Now it seems like momentum alone is pushing them onward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I just didn't believe that we were going to win the game
that easily,'' coach Phil Jackson remarked. ``I thought it was
going to be a difficult game.''
</P>
<P>
   It was supposed to be, as were many other such matchups since
Dec. 8 the date of the Lakers' last loss. But they have not let The
Streak delude them, the Lakers played consistent defense and held
the Bucks to 39.7 percent shooting and 10 points below their
average.
</P>
<P>
   All this against a team that scored 137 points two nights
earlier and beat the Charlotte Hornets by 50. And yet the Lakers
!ital!still didn't think much of the accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just means we're playing good ball,'' Robert Horry said.
``You look at that (streak), you have to really analyze how many
.500 teams did we beat during that stretch. I think it's only like
four. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Bucks) didn't rebound well. . . . They're an
offensive-minded team. Their defense rank, what, 28? When we go up
against a team that's in the top 10, then we can talk.''[p Picky,
picky. Two more wins, though, and the Lakers will have equaled the
18-game streak that Jackson's Chicago Bulls achieved during the
1995-96 championship season.
</P>
<P>
   Win No. 16 was much like the ones before it plenty of Shaquille
O'Neal (27 points, 10 rebounds), Kobe Bryant (22 points, five
assists, three steals) and Glen Rice (20 points). But the Lakers
got healthy support from the role players as well, as Ron Harper
got 16 points on 5-of-7 shooting and Horry and Derek Fisher pitched
in seven points each off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   That was more than enough to overcome the Bucks' potent trio of
Sam Cassell, Ray Allen and Glenn Robinson, who combined for 71
points but got little support from their teammates, particularly on
defense, particularly in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Cassell's 16 points propelled the Bucks to a nine-point lead in
the first half, but the Lakers with Bryant, O'Neal, Rice and Harper
all in double figures took a 56-48 lead by halftime, and they never
relinquished the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just showing that they are the best team in the
league,'' said Allen, who beat out Bryant for a spot on the Olympic
team. ``Phil Jackson has imposed his will on them, and they just go
out and win every night.''
</P>
<P>
   A third-quarter burst put it away. The Lakers had their lead cut
to four, but Bryant hit a reverse and a technical foul shot and
Rice drained consecutive 3-pointers for a 9-0 run and a 75-62
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   They opened the fourth quarter with a 10-2 run that made it a
21-pointgame, and the Bucks never challenged again.
</P>
<P>
   It looked ridiculously easy,too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems easy,'' Bryant said, ``but it just comes down to
working hard, man. The more you work at it, the better you get
it.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Lakers continue to march toward 33 wins, whether they
intend to or not, whether they can make it or not. But they won't
make it a goal.[ep ``Nope,'' O'Neal said. ``The `bling-bling' is
the goal. You know what bling-bling is? Imagine a ring, hitting the
light, the diamonds, `bling-bling.' `Bling-bling, that's all we
want.' ''

PAYTON LEADS SONICS PAST NUGGETS FOR THIRD WIN IN ROW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Sonics guard Gary Payton is on a mission.
</P>
<P>
   And his motives have nothing to do with whether he starts at the
All-Star Game next month in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   That, says Payton, is for others to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the 6-foot-4 guard is too busy planting something in
the minds of his team's opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried about getting this team right. We haven't been
playing too well. But now we're starting to do the things we're
supposed to do,'' Payton said after the Sonics beat the Denver
Nuggets, 103-93, Wednesday night at Pepsi Center.
</P>
<P>
   A part of Payton still lingers in 1999, when the Sonics ended
the 20th century with a five-game losing streak. But they have won
five of their past six games since the new millennium began.
</P>
<P>
   In beating Denver, the Sonics won their third straight, and
fourth in a row on the road. Their only blemish was a Jan. 8
twilight zone loss to the Los Angeles Lakers when the offense broke
down.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the Sonics have played sound basketball with
impressive moxie down the stretch. Payton has served as the
catalyst _ particularly in the past two games _ a back-to-back
situation _ where Payton's taken over.
</P>
<P>
   He scored 23 of his game-high 35 points in the second half
Wednesday, when the Sonics literally snatched the game away from
the Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary hasa nice game every night,'' said shooting guard Brent
Barry, who added 21 points. ``Not only does he do what you expect,
but he does things you don't expect to help win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics trailed by five points at halftime before Payton
tossed in 16 points in the third quarter. His layup that ended the
period put the Sonics in front, 78-76, heading into the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, the Sonics slowed the Nuggets' transition game long
enough for Payton to eventually put the Sonics ahead 96-89 with a
short running jumper. Barry's 3-pointer with 1:56 left in the game
was the final blow.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics went ahead 99-93, and Payton's free throws with 53
seconds left provided the final margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every night he amazes me,'' Sonics coach Paul Westphal said of
Payton. ``I hope people appreciate what they're watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton made eight of his 11 baskets in the second half, and also
finished with 10 rebounds and five assists. His effort epitomized
the Sonics' efficiency. They turned the ball over just six times in
the second half after committing 12 in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Better offensive execution swung the tempo into the Sonics'
favor. Denver had made a living off converting Sonic turnovers into
easy fast-break baskets in the first half. But the Nuggets had just
two fast-break points in the third and fourth quarters combined.
</P>
<P>
   It helped that the Sonics contained Ron Mercer, who finished
with 25 points after picking the Sonics apart for 18 points in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   Consistent production off the bench has been a plus, too. This
time, Emanual Davis scored clutch baskets.
</P>
<P>
   Davis amassed all of his 10 points in the fourth quarter and
made two 3-pointers that prevented the Nuggets from seriously
threatening. Barry had one of his best games this season, adding
eight assists and seven rebounds to his point total.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we pass the ball and rotate and get good looks, we're a
good team,'' Payton said. ``We started moving the ball in the
second half.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense, though, was the key.
</P>
<P>
   There was 11:11 left in the fourth when Denver point guard Nick
Van Exel scored his first field goal of the game. Van Exel had
missed his first five shots, and finished 2-for-11 with Payton
mostly guarding him.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night against Phoenix, Payton held Jason Kidd in
check while collecting 23 points and 13 assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Payton's) phenomenal,'' Denver coach Dan Issel said. ``There
may be only two guards in the league of his caliber with Jason Kidd
being one of them. He's one of the few players that can take over a
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Payton still trails Kidd and the Lakers' Kobe Bryant
in all-star balloting. Payton is third in the voting. He likely
will not start for the Western Conference for the first time in
three seasons, even though the mid-season classic will take place
at Payton's birthplace, Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Payton has spent most of this week discussing the All-Star Game,
although he maintains the topic should be moot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about starting and all of that stuff. I've
done all of that. I've started before and done a lot of things,''
Payton said. ``I've been to Olympic teams. I've been in the (NBA
Finals). All I need to do is win a championship. That's it.''

HALL OF FAMER LEMON DIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Bob Lemon, who went from the playgrounds of
Long Beach to baseball's Hall of Fame, died Monday night at a
convalescent hospital. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon won 207 games and two more in the 1948 World Series during
his 14-year pitching career with the Cleveland Indians, and was
elected into the Hall of Fame in 1976. He managed in parts of eight
seasons in the majors, including the 1978 New York Yankees, who
came from 14 games behind Boston to a memorable World Series title.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon suffered a stroke in December of 1998 and two more last
year, the last in November. He is survived by his wife, Jane, and
two sons, Jeff and Jim. Funeral arrangements are pending.
</P>
<P>
   ``During his prime, he was as good if not better than any
pitcher in baseball,'' said baseball legend Bob Feller, his Indians
teammate and fellow Hall of Famer. ``He was a great friend and an
even greater person.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was our hero,'' said Jack Newman, who saw Lemon play at
Wilson High of Long Beach and helped organize a monthly gathering
of old Long Beach baseball stars and fans that Lemon would attend.
``Everyone in my age group saw Bob play or played with him, and
followed his career with a passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an extremely modest man who you could never get to talk
about all the things he had achieved. He was as down to earth as
any man you'd ever meet.''
</P>
<P>
   A standout third baseman at Wilson in the late '30s, he was
named Southern California high school Player of the Year in 1938
and signed with the Cleveland Indians out of high school for $300.
</P>
<P>
   He made a brief stop in the major leagues with the Indians in
1941 and 1942 as a third baseman before spending the next three
years in the Navy, where he played, and pitched, on service teams
in Los Alamitos and Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to the Indians in 194, and was the center fielder
for them in an April game against the Yankees. He made a diving
catch to save a hit and a run in what would become Feller's second
no-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a great fielder,'' said Feller. ``He just never hit
very well. He actually was a better hitter as a pitcher. I wasn't
surprised when he became a pitcher, because I knew he had a good
arm and heard he was pitching in the Navy.''
</P>
<P>
   A variety of baseball people are credited with Lemon's
transition to pitching Indians shortstop and manager Lou Boudreau,
catchers Birdie Tebbetts and Al Lopez, former manager Bill
McKechnie, infielders and fellow Navy men Billy Herman and Johnny
Pesky, and Indians pitcher Mel Harder, whom Lemon credits with
teaching him the curve.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon made the move to the mound for good in 1947, winning 11
games, and became a starter full-time in 1948, at the age of 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a great arm, he wanted to learn, and he worked very
hard to become a pitcher,'' said Boudreau, his Indians manager.
``He had a natural sinker and he used that to his advantage on a
team that was very good defensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't the strikeout pitcher like Feller, but he got people
out. And he was a good hitter as a pitcher. He kept himself in a
lot of ballgames because he could hit.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, Lemon had his first of seven 20-win seasons, leading
the American League in innings (293), complete games (20) and
shutouts (10).
</P>
<P>
   Between 1948 and 1956, Lemon won 188 games, completed 179 of his
312 starts, and was named to the AL All-Star team seven times.
Those numbers don't really do him justice, however. The core of his
career came before baseball had created the Cy Young Award (1956)
to honor the top pitcher in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon also hit 37 career home runs, one behind the all-time
pitchers' record of 38 by Wes Farrell, and seven in one season
(1949). His career average as a pinch-hitter was .284.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon appeared in two World Series, winning two games in the
Indians' six-game 1948 triumph, the last title for the franchise,
and losing two in 1954. That season, the Indians won 111 games but
lost four straight to the New York Giants in the World Series.
Lemon was the Indians pitcher in Game 1, which was marked by Willie
Mays' catch of a Vic Wertz drive to the deepest part of the Polo
Grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon retired in 1958, then returned to baseball as a coach and
front-office official with the Indians (1960), Phillies (1961) and
Angels (1962-68).
</P>
<P>
   Lemon got his first opportunity to manage with the Kansas City
Royals in 1970, went 85-76 in 1971, but was fired in 1972. He
managed the Chicago White Sox in 1977, going 90-72, but was fired
at midseason a year later.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs broadcaster Steve Stone was on that 1977 team. ``Lem was a
pretty easy-going guy who, because he'd been through the wars, gave
pitchers the benefit of the doubt. If you couldn't play for Bob,
you couldn't play for anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   His firing in Chicago allowed him to be hired to replace Billy
Martin during one of the Yankees' more chaotic seasons. George
Steinbrenner had already gone through Martin and Dick Howser before
tapping Lemon.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees went 48-20 under Lemon, making up a 14-game gap on
Boston, winning a one-game playoff, beating Kansas City in the
ALCS, and then finishing off the Dodgers in six games of the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``When our team was going through the turmoil (1978), Bob was
just what we needed,'' said Steinbrenner in a statement. ``He was
such a calming influence . . . he guided the club to the world
championship in one of the greatest comebacks in sports history. He
was a gentle man but a consummate competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemon managed parts of three more seasons for the Yankees and
remained an official paid scout for the Yankees up until his
passing.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon's life was touched by one giant tragedy. The youngest of
his three sons, Jerry, was killed in November of 1978 in a one-car
accident while driving to Arizona to visit his brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he ever recovered from his son's death,'' said
Feller. ``I would see him every year at Cooperstown (during the
induction ceremonies), but he was really hurt by that.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of Lemon's last interviews, with Long Beach
Press-Telegram columnist Doug Krikorian, before his stroke in 1998,
he assessed his life and career in simple terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``How am I doing? I'm soon going to be 78. I'm an old man. I'm
soon going to die. But life's been good to me. Been married to the
same lady for 54 years. Been living in the same house since 1949.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy. I meet with my old cronies once a month. I love
this town.'' Any regrets? ``Nah. Had a good life. It's been like a
storybook. No regrets.''
</P>

A NEW DAY IN L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There were no USC basketball players proposing to
girlfriends at midcourt, but that was about the only difference as
the Trojans broke another streak of futility against UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   USC snapped its second losing streak to its cross-town rivals in
two months, dominating the Bruins in a 91-79 victory before 10,001
at the Sports Arena on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   It was USC's first victory over UCLA since March 3, 1994. The
Trojans had lost 10 straight games to the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   That's similar to USC snapping its losing streak in football to
UCLA at eight games last November at the Coliseum, which included
quarterback John Fox successfully proposing to his girlfriend at
midfield after the game.
</P>
<P>
   No such dramatics this time, but USC celebrated this victory
nearly as much.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans enjoyed one of their most lopsided recent victories
over UCLA, leading by 19 points (63-44) when guard Brandon
Granville hit a 3-pointer with 14:17 remaining. It was USC's
biggest margin of victory against UCLA since a 15-point win in
1986.
</P>
<P>
   USC (10-5, 3-0) was on top of its game from the outset, as the
Trojans played one of their best halves of the season. The Trojans
had a lopsided 28-10 rebounding advantage in the opening 20
minutes, and had more offensive rebounds (12) than UCLA had total
rebounds. Guard Jeff Trepagnier had seven rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The discrepancy belied USC coach Henry Bibby's fears before the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very physical,'' Bibby said. ``They remind me of
Arizona a couple years ago that really pounded the boards.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans took an early 12-5 advantage, and although the
Bruins cut the lead to one point (14-13), USC boosted the advantage
to eight points (27-19) after Granville hit a 3-pointer and layup.
</P>
<P>
   USC increased its lead to 35-23 after David Bluthenthal's layup,
and took its biggest advantage of the half (47-34) on Trepagnier's
dunk with 0.01 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Trepagnier was the star for USC with a career-high 26 points on
11-of-16 shooting before fouling out. UCLA was led by freshman
Jason Kapono, who had 21.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for USC's early success was because the Trojans
shot 51.3 percent from the field in the first half while the Bruins
(9-4, 1-2) shot 43.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Granville (12 points) and Trepagnier (11) were USC's leading
scorers in the first half. Kapono led the Bruins with 11 points,
hitting 5 of 7 shots.
</P>
<P>
   USC's fast start was not surprising, considering how serious the
players were heading into the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about as big as it's been here,'' sophomore forward Sam
Clancy said. ``We've won two on the road people didn't expect. The
time is right, right now for us to play them.''
</P>
<P>
   USC is currently alone in first place in the Pacific-10
Conference, a half-game ahead of Arizona (13-2, 2-0).
</P>
<P>
   Before the contest, Bibby tried to emphasize how much respect he
had for his alma mater, even as criticism has mounted in recent
weeks over the Bruins' play.
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk about how bad UCLA's been, but UCLA's very good,''
Bibby said.``It's probably the best execution since I've been here.
They probably have more patience. I'm not trying to play UCLA up.
I'm saying what it's like.''
</P>
<P>
   After that glowing assessment, Bibby finally conceded that USC
might be the superior team in one area. ``I think maybe we shoot
the ball a little better,'' he said, then quickly added, ``But they
fastbreak the ball better than we do.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: Traffic outside the Sports Arena was a mess before the
game, because the Coliseum scheduled a soccer doubleheader at the
same time, clogging surface streets like it was a USC football
game. . . . Among those at the game were former Lakers coach and
USC basketball player Bill Sharman and New York Jets and former USC
wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson.

ENCRYPTION EXPORT RULES RELAXED
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By HENRY NORR and TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bowing to intense pressure from Silicon Valley, the Clinton
administration has eliminated most restrictions on the export of
data-encryption technology _ software that scrambles electronic
messages to keep them private.
</P>
<P>
   The move Wednesday fulfilled a commitment the White House made
September when it abandoned its long-standing opposition to
liberalized encryption-export rules. Since then, high-tech
executives and lobbyists have been battling behind the scenes to
shape the new regulations their way, over the opposition of
law-enforcement and national-security officials who fear that
easier access to encryption would help terrorists and other
criminals keep their communications secret.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, industry spokespeople expressed satisfaction
with the new rules, saying they should help U.S. firms compete more
effectively in the global marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over encryption had put the administration in a
difficult position. Republicans attempted to use the issue to drive
a wedge between the Clinton administration and Silicon Valley, an
increasingly potent political force.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules permit U.S. companies to export any encryption
product available on the retail market to businesses and
individuals in almost every country in the world. In most cases,
software publishers will have to submit their products to the
Commerce Department for a one-time review, but they'll no longer
have to apply for a license on each sale.
</P>
<P>
   Exports of advanced encryption technology to foreign governments
will still require licenses, and they will remain prohibited to
seven countries that the U.S. considers ``terrorist-supporting
states'' _ Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   The revised rules should mean reduced costs and new business
opportunities for many U.S. companies. Rick Miller, a Microsoft
spokesman, noted that the government's previous restrictions on
encryption exports increased the software giant's development costs
by forcing it to produce separate U.S. and international versions
of its Windows 95 and Windows 98 operating systems, as well as its
Internet Explorer browser.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't calculate lost product sales,'' Miller said. ``But we
do know that customers overseas were saying they really wanted
encryption and that they couldn't buy our products because we
didn't have it.''
</P>
<P>
   High-tech officials had also complained that the old rules put
them at a disadvantage because they were unable to compete with
software developers in countries without stringent export controls.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Larson, chairman and chief executive of Network Associates,
a Santa Clara developer of security and antivirus software, said
his company lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in the fourth
quarter of 1999 alone because the old rules prohibited it from
selling some data-scrambling technology to banks in Mexico. They
also prevented the company from providing its encryption software
to multinational companies based overseas, such as Sony or
DaimlerChrysler, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the software market's changing landscape, the
industry had lobbied hard for a definition of ``retail software''
that would encompass not only packaged products, but programs sold
over the Internet and even software on network servers that
customers pay for on a per-use basis _ both increasingly common
phenomena.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Clinton administration accepted the broad
definition. Dan Cooperman, senior vice president and general
counsel of database-maker Oracle in Redwood Shores called that a
``breakthrough.'' ``The new policy recognizes online channels of
distribution for the first time,'' he said. ``Online sales and
online distribution will be driving our business in the future.
This will allow us to implement a single global model for all our
products.'`
</P>
<P>
   The new rules also eliminate all restrictions on exports of
encryption products to foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies, as
well as regulations that required licenses before foreign nationals
working in the United States for U.S. firms could work on
encryption.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry representatives are still concerned about the
complexity of the export regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big step, but I wouldn't consider it total victory,''
said Piper Cole, vice president for global public policy at Sun
Microsystems. ``The regulations are still a little complex, with
different procedures and review periods for government and
nongovernment customers and retail and nonretail products.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we need any further major changes,'' she added,
``but there's plenty of room for streamlining and simplification.''
She said the Clinton administration has committed to review the
rules within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Civil libertarians have raised the same issue. ``I don't want to
underestimate the advance this represents,'' said David Sobel,
general counsel of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in
Washington, ``but the bottom line for us is that this is not
decontrol _ a very complicated licensing process remains in place.
To our mind, encryption software shouldn't be treated any
differently from word processing or spreadsheet software.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes announced Wednesday, Sobel noted, are ``all cast in
terms of exceptions. If you don't fall under any of the exceptions
they've spelled out, you're still under the old regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Cohn, an attorney working with the Electronic Frontier
Foundation, an online civil liberties lobby, said the new
regulations still prevent people from freely sharing new encryption
software over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn represents former University of California at Berkeley
mathematician Dan Bernstein, who sued the government six years ago,
charging that his First Amendment rights were violated by rules
requiring him to seek government permission before posting new
encryption software on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Sun's Cole, however, said she believes that the new rules will
protect researchers and others who choose post new algorithms on
the Internet. She cited a passage that expressly removes controls
on ``open-source'' software posted on the Internet, as long as the
poster sends the Internet address to the government.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, when the first Republican-sponsored bills to
liberalize encryption exports were introduced, the measures have
gradually built up strong support. One bill, authored by Rep. Bob
Goodlatte, R-Va., was poised to go to a floor vote, with 285
co-sponsors, including prominent Bay Area Democrats such as Zoe
Lofgren. Goodlatte praised the administration ``for making a
180-degree about-face'' on the encryption issue, but he couldn't
pass up a parting jab.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only sorry they may have been about two or three years too
late on this issue because they've allowed other countries like
Israel to create some strong competitors to our U.S. firms,''
Goodlatte said.

 REPUBLICAN FORUM TO CONCENTRATE ON GETTING LATINO VOTE  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE _ Declaring the Latino vote to be the hottest political
battleground in the war for the White House, Republicans are
meeting in San Jose this week to appeal to them on issues, at the
ballot box _ and even on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The 165-member Republican National Committee is gathered for its
winter meeting this week at the Fairmont Hotel to hash out a game
plan for the coming elections and address a range of issues,
including congressional races, outreach to women, and technology.
But GOP leaders made it clear that from now until November, their
chief spotlight will be aimed at Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Leadership Council opened the week with a special
focus group for 14 working-class Latinos to hear their views on a
range of issues, particularly health care. Republican leaders are
trying to talk up medical programs such as Fair Care, a limited
tax-credit proposal by Republican House Majority Leader Dick Armey
of Texas that serves as an alternative to those already floated by
Democrats Al Gore and Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't get the party talking about ideas, we're going to
lose,'' said Scott Reed, who managed Bob Dole's 1996 campaign and
now heads the Republican Leadership Council. ``We're going to
devise a strategy in a very targeted manner ... and the way to do
that is to talk about issues that matter in people's lives, like
health care.''
</P>
<P>
   The RNC plans to unveil what it calls ``a sweeping political and
cultural poll'' of Latino voters and a panel targeting Latino
voters Thursday, and to debut a multimillion-dollar ad campaign to
run in California and other key states. The campaign was described
as ``the first in a series ... intended to broaden the party's
efforts to earn the trust'' of Latinos. But party leaders,
acknowledging that more than 70 percent of the Latino vote in
California went to Democrats in 1998, said aggressive moves will be
needed.
</P>
<P>
   RNC Chairman Jim Nicholson, in a press conference to unveil the
new GOPnet.com Web site _ which effectively makes the GOP an
Internet service provider _ argued that technology will be one
critical way to reach out to women and minority voters in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
   But it was clear that there still is some work needed in the
party's new efforts to reach out to new communities. At one seminar
yesterday, for example, GOP women were instructed in how to speak
on behalf of the party before community groups and to media.
</P>
<P>
   The lecturer, telling the crowd that many Americans don't think
Republicans are in touch with the culture, urged them to use
keywords that would show them to be knowledgeable and sensitive.
For Latinos, he said, a mention of Ricky Martin and ``La Vida
Loca'' might be appropriate, according to one who watched the
presentation.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Republicans attempted to discuss the issues, it was
also clear that Democrats didn't intend to concede the Latino vote.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Loretta Sanchez of Orange County, who co-chairs
the Democratic National Committee, came to the Fairmont to
challenge GOP leadership directly, while issuing a letter to
Nicholson charging that what Republicans have done for Latinos is
too little and too late.
</P>
<P>
   She pointed out that under President Clinton, Latino
unemployment has been halved, business loans to Latinos have more
than doubled and that Latinos now represent more Cabinet members _
12 percent _ than ever before in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not allow you to run away from your party record,''
Sanchez wrote, citing what she called ``divisive'' measures from
the GOP, including English-only legislation and Prop. 209, which
called for an end to affirmative-action programs.
</P>
<P>
   In a clear jab at Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who has touted his
outreach to Latinos in state campaign stops, Sanchez said, ``We
will not allow Latinos to be used as props at events or as photo
opportunities by your presidential candidates during this election
cycle.'' Bush, she later told The Chronicle, has been
``particularly offensive'' in that area, making a point to speak
Spanish at events and surrounding himself with Latinos on stage.
She said she will remind him and other Republicans that he will not
be able to ``rewrite history'' in the coming election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats are content leaving Latinos in their own poverty,''
countered RNC deputy press secretary Leslie Sanchez, who is no
relation. ``We are fighting for opportunity and prosperity.''

REPUBLICAN PARTY FAITHFUL GET WIRED
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It used to be that the best way to gauge a national
organization's political clout was by the length of its mailing
list and the depth of its pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's another way: Internet traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Heavyweight national organizations, from labor unions to
political parties, are rapidly embracing the Net as a way of
forging tighter bonds with members.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee announced the latest example
Wednesday at its winter meeting in San Jose _ a GOPnet.com portal
that party leaders say is the most extensive and sophisticated
Internet outreach effort by any political party to date.
</P>
<P>
   The move underscores how the Internet is not only reshaping
internal operations for large organizations, but also transforming
the entire political landscape as more information becomes
available online and as voters in turn become more engaged in the
electoral process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Web organizing is a tool that's absolutely essential,'' said
Elizabeth Toledo, vice president of the National Organization for
Women. ``It's not an option.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of efforts to bring more women onto the Net, she said
NOW is in talks with potential partners about creating its own
online service, which may provide cut-rate access for the
organization's roughly 500,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see the Internet as the best mechanism we've ever had to
reach members,'' said Mark Carpenter, manager of interactive
services for the 32 million-strong American Association of Retired
Persons.
</P>
<P>
   The politically influential AARP already offers members a 10
percent discount for leading online services. Carpenter said free
Net access is now being explored.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the powerful AFL-CIO plans to present a new
initiative later this week to bring its 13 million members into the
Information Age. Under the Workingfamilies.com program, the labor
confederation will provide members with low-cost computers and Net
access, as well as portals for individual unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is that we don't leave any union members
behind in closing the digital divide,'' said Leslie Tolf, assistant
to AFL-CIO President John Sweeney.
</P>
<P>
   For an organization, the benefits of being wired are readily
apparent. The Net facilitates fund-raising, lobbying and
communication with the rank and file. All this, in turn, translates
into increased political muscle.
</P>
<P>
   For members, there is greater access to information and services
and a heightened sense of inclusion in the form of online
discussions, chats and communities.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are hoping their party faithful will feel
suitably empowered by GOPnet.com. The site offers such proven lures
as free e-mail, chat rooms and even stock quotes, as well as
political news bulletins and online shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee,
said his party has undergone ``a digital revolution'' that will
allow it to reach 100,000 GOP activists daily by the start of the
Republican National Convention in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at phase one right now in terms of building our
community,'' said Larry Purpuro, the committee's deputy chief of
staff. ``Phase two is to deliver all our activities online in a
seamless, paperless format.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, he pointed out, surveys show that more than half of the
approximately 40 million registered Republicans use the Internet
every day and that about a third are online at least five hours a
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the Net an improved information channel?'' Purpuro asked.
``That's a no-brainer. It's the telephone, TV and radio all rolled
into one.''
</P>
<P>
   Although few might immediately associate the buttoned-down GOP
with cutting-edge technology, Purpuro insists that the party's
commitment to unregulated business makes it the true champion of
Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   He characterizes the Democrats as being all too eager to impose
restrictions on the tech industry's vitality and entrepreneurism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that Al Gore has invented the Internet, he should just
stay away from it,'' Purpuro said. ``Silicon Valley is an example
of Republican free-market ideals in action.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, needless to say, beg to differ.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Republicans are doing is just an image,'' said Joe
Andrew, chairman of the Democratic National Committee. ``It's just
public relations. The Republicans are focused on using the Internet
only for fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal,'' he continued, ``is to make as many people vote as
possible. We're focused very much on the Internet as an
organization tool.''
</P>
<P>
   As such, the Democrats' Web site at  &UR; www.democrats.org  &LR; is a bit
more static than what the Republicans will be cooking up this week.
It is designed to inform users rather than to invite them in to
join the festivities.
</P>
<P>
   This will change, though. Democratic sources say a number of
upgrades are in the works, including online chats with top party
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew shrugged off the suggestion that the Republicans are
making headway in being perceived as the truly wired political
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is part of everything we do,'' he said. ``But all
that really matters is whether you win elections. Winning elections
is all about using the Internet as an organizing tool.''
</P>
<P>
   Helping out in this regard are a number of private companies
that specialize in Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   One of the leading such firms in the political arena is an Idaho
outfit called Netivation.com. Its Votenet.com site provides a Web
presence for a variety of state party chapters and candidates in
local races.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably the coolest feature at Votenet is a ``Follow the
Money'' box that allows users to simply type in a zip code to see
who in any particular neighborhood is making political donations
and how much is being given.
</P>
<P>
   A check of Beverly Hills (90210), for instance, reveals that
actress Candice Bergen has donated $1,000 to both the Gore and
Bradley campaigns, while ``Batman'' co-producer Jon Peters has
handed $1,000 to the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``You used to have to fly to Washington and stand in line and
ask for those records,'' said Tony Paquin, Netivation's chief
executive. ``This is a clear example of how the Internet is
changing the rules of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Another such example is how adept candidates are becoming at
raising money online. It's no coincidence that when Bill Bradley
appears at campaign events, a sign is displayed promoting his Web
site,  &UR; www.billbradley.com,  &LR; where the ``Get Involved'' button
leads visitors to a link for making donations.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley claims to have raised about $1.3 million via the Net so
far, while Gore has raked in just $900,000 online.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush remains the clear leader in overall fund-raising
_ pocketing a record $67 million as of the end of December _ but
only about $200,000 has arrived via the Net. His main challenger
for the Republican nod, John McCain, has raised about five times
that amount online.
</P>
<P>
   On a party basis, the Republicans have historically proved
themselves to be more effective at fund-raising than the Democrats.
A growing awareness of the power of the Internet likely will
increase that advantage _ and the party doesn't mind if there's
snickering in Silicon Valley about the GOP's newly minted
cyber-credentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if we win the industry-insider campaign for
who's more Net-savvy,'' said Purpuro at the Republican National
Committee. ``The proof will be in the pudding.''

MAYOR IS ALWAYS THE LAST TO KNOW
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
I found myself in Chicago on Tuesday, though I don't mean that in
the spiritual sense, because I wasn't on a journey of
self-discovery. (``Self, please pick up the white courtesy
phone.'')
<P>
   The Chicago Tribune had a front-page story about a scandal
involving Mayor Richard Daley, who was simultaneously apologizing
for the bad stuff and lashing out at the media for exposing it,
which is harder to do than patting your head while rubbing your
tummy.
</P>
<P>
   The story sounded eerily familiar.
</P>
<P>
   A company with a contract with the city was getting waaay more
city money than it should have been getting. And hey, the company's
owner buys much insurance from the mayor's brother and is best pals
with the city's purchasing agent, and is a major contributor to
Mayor Daley's campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier Tribune expose told of a female-owned company that
won millions of bucks in minority city contracts but is actually
run by men, who happen to be Daley campaign contributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm upset with myself,'' Daley said. ``I'm mad at myself. I'm
embarrassed. These things should have been caught, to be very
frank.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Daley denied that he knew any of this stuff was going on, or
that he used his influence to help these close pals get city money.
In fact, how could anybody think he could stoop so low? He's the
mayor, gosh-darnit!
</P>
<P>
   Wow, that kind of stuff could never happen here in the Cool,
Gray City of Kooky Kontracts. But it makes you wonder:
</P>
<P>
   -- Why do so many of these shaky contracts that mayors know
absolutely nothing about involve close friends of, big contributors
to, and/ or people with business links to the mayor? So many zany
coincidences!
</P>
<P>
   -- How come the mayors never know anything until the spit hits
the fan? Aren't mayors supposed to know stuff?
</P>
<P>
   -- Since mayors usually hear about the trouble first in the
newspaper, why don't mayors hire their own investigative people to
dig up stuff to tell the mayor, thus scooping the nasty newspapers?
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Daley used a word to describe what it is he denies
doing. If a contract is awarded because of some cozy relationship
with the mayor, the contract was ``clouted.''
</P>
<P>
   A good Chicago-type word, but it could also be used here, if
anything like that were to ever happen.
</P>
<P>
   STEVE YOUNG OUT of the 49ers' picture? Yes, say inside sources.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't really gossip. More like hearsay.
</P>
<P>
   Steve is engaged, you know. He and she (Barbara Graham, if you
must be nosy) were in a Peninsula deli and the counter people asked
her if Steve would be back next season at QB, and she supposedly
said, ``It doesn't matter what the doctors say. I'm not going to
start spoon-feeding him while he sits in a wheelchair the day after
the wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   Memo to Barbara: Can Steve come out and play quarterback?
Please? I happen to know that he has saved some money, despite
splurging on a new wardrobe every few years at the Gap. So you can
hire someone to spoon-feed him.
</P>
<P>
   YOU GO, GUY! Arthur Jackson, a dynamo in local government and
business, got a phone call Tuesday afternoon: ``Mr. Jackson, have
we got a kidney for you!''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has been on dialysis for six years, waiting, a dynamo
cut to half power by a funky organ. Yesterday, he got his kidney.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur runs Jackson Personnel Agency and has been commissioner
of the Public Health Dept. and the Commission on Aging.
</P>
<P>
   This is your man if you're looking for someone who gives his
heart to the city. So Arthur getting a kidney seems like a fair
trade.
</P>
<P>
   DEAD MAN BALKING: A letter to Datebook, published Tuesday,
regretted an omission from a list of significant deaths of '99 in
the local arts world.
</P>
<P>
   Letter-writer Ken Sundowner praised Chet Helms, one of the
giants of the '60s S.F. hippie music scene, and a large presence in
the arts community until his death last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was a shock to Chet. His semi-grieving friends have
scheduled a wake Monday at the Gold Coast, at happy hour. Chet will
be brought in by hearse, in a casket, and will be given his
second-to-last rites.
</P>
<P>
   Sundowner will be invited to ride in the hearse.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Fisk did it the right way
 &HT;    (For release Jan. 16, 2000.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carlton Fisk was a major-league baseball player with a .269
lifetime batting average. He hit a renowned home run in the sixth
game of the 1975 World Series. He lasted 24 seasons in the major
leagues and caught more games than any other catcher in history;
2,226.
</P>
<P>
   Just his durability was enough to elect him to baseball's Hall
of Fame last week at the age of 52. But there is far more to the
man.
</P>
<P>
   Catchers often have to endure constant taunting about their
equipment. It's called ``the tools of ignorance.'' What intelligent
person would want to take such a beating behind home plate?
</P>
<P>
   Yogi Berra played the ``ignorant'' catcher into a commodity,
even though he was a lot smarter than anyone ever gave him credit
for and didn't say half the things for which he's been quoted.
Carlton Fisk was just the opposite. From his beginning days with
the Boston Red Sox, Fisk had an erudite manner about him. He
functioned as an elder statesman before he ever became an elder.
</P>
<P>
   There is one moment in Fisk's major-league career that stands
out to me as the hallmark difference between the players of a
generation ago and those who play today for big bucks.
</P>
<P>
   I would hope that when the baseball writers voted Fisk into the
Hall of Fame, this incident was part of the equation, just as equal
to or surpassing the consideration given his durability.
</P>
<P>
   On May 22, 1990, Fisk was the catcher for the Chicago White Sox,
having left Boston _ and his native New England _ over a contract
squabble. The White Sox were playing the Yankees in New York. On
that Yankees team was a brash rookie celebrated alternately as Neon
Deion Sanders or Prime Time Deion; the same fellow who now plays
defensive football quite well for the Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   He was awash in gold chains and he swaggered. As a major-league
baseball player, he never amounted to much. But he did talk a good
game.
</P>
<P>
   Anyhow, Sanders was at bat and popped a pitch up to the second
baseman. Part way down the path to first base, Sanders quit
running. He was an easy out, he figured, so why bother to run?
</P>
<P>
   From behind the plate, emotion overcame Fisk.
</P>
<P>
   As Sanders walked from the first base line back to the Yankees
dugout, Fisk pursued him, demanding that he run it out. ``There is
a right way and a wrong way to play this game,'' he called out.
``You're playing it the wrong way.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he was not a Yankee, Fisk knew the tradition and
glory of the Yankees franchise. He later said that Lou Gehrig had
to be spinning in his grave at Prime Time's lack of industry.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, Sanders has not really talked that much about
the incident. Nevertheless, he has changed his lifestyle; while
still a flashy dresser, he is very much a born-again Christian.
He's a bit more humble and I would speculate that if ever he popped
up again, he'd run like the wind to first base _ the Fisk message
not being lost.
</P>
<P>
   From that moment on, I felt Fisk was destined for the Hall of
Fame. He has been described as anachronistic and maybe that is
true. But what baseball needs, what all of professional sports
needs, is players with a little more devotion to their game and
less to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Football has been infected with taunting athletes who have
degraded the game with their egotistical displays on the field. All
but gone are the athletes who, after scoring a touchdown, simply
hand the ball to the game official. They've been replaced by
gyrating exhibitionists who are joined by chorus lines of teammates
in displays of leg and pelvic dexterity and coordination.
</P>
<P>
   We need more Carlton Fisks in professional sports, not so much
for their batting averages or off-tackle slants, but for what their
sports meant to them and should mean to all professional athletes:
a little humility, please.
</P>
<P>
   That's the legacy that brought Carlton Fisk to the summit of
baseball excellence.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Deportation law is plain un-American
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It looks as though Mary Anne Gehris will slip the hangman's
noose that the Immigration and Naturalization Service had around
her neck, but if her near-death experience doesn't convince
Congress to scrap its over-the-top deportation law, then is it hard
to imagine any abuse will ever move the legislators.
</P>
<P>
   One of Congress's anti-crime spasms coincided in 1996 with one
of its anti-immigrant spasms. The resulting convulsion cast up a
law requiring the deportation of immigrants convicted of crimes
carrying a one-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The law has been piling up an appalling record of heartless
deportations, as longtime residents are torn from friends and
relatives and thrown out of the country for minor brushes with the
law, incidents sometimes decades old and often the only blemish on
sound lives. Some are sent ``back'' to countries they left as
infants and can't remember and whose language they don't speak.
</P>
<P>
   Gehris's case is especially absurd and cruel, but at its core it
is not atypical.
</P>
<P>
   Born German, she was adopted by a Georgia family when she was 2
years old. She was reared in Georgia, lives there and is married
and has two children, including a 14-year-old with cerebral palsy.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago Gehris decided finally to apply for
citizenship, formalizing her as the American that in every other
way she manifestly is. She answered honestly when she was routinely
asked whether she had ever been convicted of a crime _ and the next
thing she knew, INS was giving her the bum's rush to Germany.
</P>
<P>
   And just what danger were the American people to be protected
from? Eleven years ago, Gehris pulled another woman's hair in a
spat over a guy and was put on probation for a year as a
misdemeanant. That's it.
</P>
<P>
   Gehris's story hit The New York Times and the ``Today'' show.
Staffers at the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles read it in The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution and invited Gehris's lawyer to submit
a pardon application. A pardon would moot the deportation.
</P>
<P>
   But that's a rare break. INS deports about 62,000 a year and
says 90 percent are here illegally in the first place or have been
convicted of felonies. Only some few hundred are deported for petty
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   OK, but hundreds, year after year, add up to a lot of injustice
and needless heartache. Few cases manage to get the attention
Gehris lucked into, and fewer still find a magical out if they do.
Gehris's attorney has clients who are being deported for
shoplifting $15 in baby clothes and for stealing a sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the way America is supposed to work. Congress needs
to repeal this mindless and brutish law, return to the old tripwire
of a five-year sentence, give discretion back to immigration judges
in cases involving minor crime and let deportation rulings be
appealed to federal courts under certain conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Two bills have been introduced to fix the 1996 excesses. Our
honor rides on them. Justice shouldn't have to depend upon winning
the publicity lottery.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   By now, the excitement caused by Boris Yeltsin's New Year's Eve
bombshell-resignation as Russia's president has subsided.
</P>
<P>
   The experts and the pundits have had their say. The more honest
of them are admitting that they find Russia's prospects
unpredictable, but they still aren't shy about giving advice to
business and government leaders who solicit it.
</P>
<P>
   Mercifully, the advice offered now is a bit different from what
Russian and Western policy makers heard from many so-called experts
in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In those heady first post-Soviet months, few doubted and even
fewer challenged the ``Washington consensus,'' which unreservedly
stated that Russia could achieve overnight economic success if it
followed a few simple prescriptions. It was taken for granted, of
course, that an economically Westernized Russia would not only be a
democracy but also a faithful ally of the West.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, despite zig-zagging events, Western and particularly
U.S. leaders have been claiming their ideas and policies toward
Russia worked well _ which, some skeptics say, has meant closing
one's eyes to the failures and disasters so plentiful in recent
Russian history.
</P>
<P>
   And so today, despite an urgent desire to figure out what's
going on in Russia, there is uncertainty on the core questions
crucial to its place in the emerging world order: Who is in charge?
Is Russia a democracy? Whither its relations with the West?
</P>
<P>
   The answers to the first two questions are by no means simple
but the manner in which the handover of power from the ailing
Yeltsin to Acting President Vladimir Putin, the former KGB spy, was
accomplished speaks volumes. Rather than ``facilitating the
democratic process'' (in fact, the word democracy was not even
mentioned in Yeltsin's resignation speech), it was aimed at
clearing the way for Yeltsin's hand-picked successor while he is
riding the jingoistic wave of the military campaign in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Given the Russian government's virtually total control over the
electronic media and the dependence of most regional governors on
the Kremlin's good will, it is clear that what remains for the
Russian voters on March 26 is to ratify the choice made by Yeltsin
and his ``extended family'' _ the small group of compromised
officials and business tycoons whose greed is largely responsible
for Russia's current mess.
</P>
<P>
   As Lyudmila Telen, deputy editor of the weekly Moskovskiye
Novosti, or Moscow News, wrote in their special edition, ``having
appointed Putin acting president, Yeltsin in essence has appointed
us acting voters.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the March 26 election in Russia is likely to
resemble the polls held in the Central Asian republics of the
former Soviet Union or in some of the ethnic republics, where the
victory of ``the boss'' is 100 percent assured.
</P>
<P>
   Some Western commentators actually say that this ``stability''
is an inevitable and even welcome phase in Russia's ``evolving
democracy,'' or democratic evolution, depending on one's
predilection for phraseology. And the observers from various
European organizations are likely to deem the spring elections free
and fair.
</P>
<P>
   But surely this is not what most of us wanted or expected 10
years ago, nor is it the best that Russia could achieve.
</P>
<P>
   The hot topic of debate now is what policies Putin will pursue
once elected. Experts are already lining up to make pronouncements
but they have little on which to base their analysis. Putin's
recent ``mission statement'' _ an apparently well-meaning, eclectic
article about his policies and views and published on the
government's web site _ contains something for every taste.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, most of it (the patriotism, the need for Russia to
become competitive in the world market) could be endorsed by just
about everyone in Russia's political spectrum _ from the
pro-capitalist former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko to the
Communist Party leader Gennadi A. Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
   Very soon, however, Putin will have to show his true colors. No
litmus test will be more important than what he does and the
attitude he shows toward corruption and crime. Will Putin act as
someone beholden to the likes of the shady businessman and
political operator Boris Berezovsky, or will he take the risk of
challenging their power?
</P>
<P>
   The initial signs do not look good _ in fact it was on Putin's
watch as head of the FSB, or domestic intelligence agency, that the
books on a number of criminal investigations involving Russia's
``oligarchs'' were closed. But some believe that Putin could yet
surprise us.
</P>
<P>
   Another test will of course come in Chechnya, a test not just
for Putin but for the entire Russian society, which so uncritically
and apparently eagerly and proudly has been supporting a war in
which there will be no victors.
</P>
<P>
   So Russia is at best an imperfect or distorted democracy. Its
ruling class deserves no plaudits. As for the West, after years of
routine praise for Yeltsin because he was a good ally, does it mean
that relations with Russia are bound to deteriorate? Not
necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   There is no alternative to the policy of ``engaging Russia.''
Russia must be engaged not because it is good or bad but because it
is there. It would be wrong to call Russia nearly irrelevant, as
one Republican policy adviser recently did, just because its
``nuclear missiles are rusting in their silos.'' Even if that were
true, relations with Moscow should not be confined to the security
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the only specific bilateral issue President Clinton's
national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, mentioned in a recent
speech was to get Russia's agreement on U.S. efforts to build a
national missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   What would best suit both Russian and American interests now is
a return to a wide-ranging and realistic dialogue unaffected either
by a sentimental attachment to Russia's ``democrats'' and
``reformers'' or by any residual Cold War mentality.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Yeltsin's departure will make such a dialogue more
likely.

<P>
   For the first time, an opinion poll reveals what the Russian
public thinks about a wide range of nuclear security issues, from
the Strategic Arms Control Treaty to nuclear smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, ``Examining Attitudes of Russians Towards Nuclear
Weapons and Nuclear Threats,'' was jointly sponsored by Moscow's
Center for Policy Studies in Russia and the Center for
Nonproliferation Studies of the Monterey Institute in California.
</P>
<P>
   It was based on interviews with 1,500 people in 56 localities
throughout the Russian Federation, and was released Nov. 16. The
research was conducted by Fond Obshestvennoye Mneniye _ a well
respected, politically independent Russian polling company.
</P>
<P>
   The survey helps to clarify how Russians think about nuclear
weapons _ including the role they play in world politics, how much
Russia needs them for its own security and how they could be
diverted for use by international terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The results also demonstrate that, as elsewhere, the public on
this issue does not always agree with the official government and
military positions.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the end of the Cold War and a halt to the U.S.-Soviet
superpower arms race, the survey showed that a significant number
of Russians find comfort in their country's nuclear weapons; 77
percent supported the Russian National Security Concept provision
that says: ``Nuclear weapons play a decisive role in providing
national security.''
</P>
<P>
   Of those polled, 24 percent acknowledged that it is costly for
Russia to maintain its nuclear arsenal, but 32 percent said Russia
ought to have as many nukes as the United States _ while 26 percent
supported the idea of a Russia with more nuclear weapons than
America.
</P>
<P>
   As for totally deactivating their nuclear weapons, it wasn't a
popular idea: 82 percent thought Russia's nuclear arsenal must be
on active duty and ready for use; a mere 12 percent said that the
nukes should be kept in storage. Only 18 percent of those polled
thought Russia didn't need any nukes at all.
</P>
<P>
   That such weapons could fall into the hands of the wrong people
weighed heavily on respondents, with fear voiced about possible
sabotage of Russian nuclear facilities, including power plants and
nuclear munitions storage sites _ 90 percent of those polled
expressed such a fear.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the survey was taken after a devastating series of
terrorist bombs in Moscow and other Russian cities killed more than
300 people _ attacks blamed by the Kremlin on Chechen warlords and
bandits, although solid evidence of guilt remains absent. This
continues to be used as rationale for the bloody Russian military
campaign in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the fact that nine out of every 10 of Russian
adults polled said that nuclear sabotage is possible demonstrates
how great the fear is. It also shows how little the Russian people
trust the official statements which claim that ``all strategic
facilities are under control.''
</P>
<P>
   While only 52 percent of those polled expressed concern about a
nuclear attack by foreign states, 86 percent expressed fear that
international terrorists might use nuclear weapons against Russia.
Only 10 percent considered such terrorism to be improbable; only 4
percent had difficulty answering this question, which suggests that
the majority are indeed living with concern about nuclear
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Russians, the poll revealed, simply don't buy the
assurances of their senior government officials that there is no
way for nuclear thieves to steal weapons-grade fissile materials
from domestic nuclear facilities. The majority, 83 percent of
respondents, believed it possible to smuggle such lethal materials
out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Russians generally valued the concept of curbing the spread of
nukes, with 76 percent saying the world would be far less stable if
more countries had nuclear weapons. Education played a role in
this: 81 percent of those with a higher education said nuclear
proliferation would diminish global stability; so did 74 percent of
those with a secondary education and 64 percent with a primary
education.
</P>
<P>
   Even those respondents who believed that world stability could
be improved by the proliferation of nuclear weapons opposed the
idea of selling Russian nuclear arms and technologies abroad.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Russians don't balk at the idea of total world
nuclear disarmament. Of those polled, 57 percent believed the world
would be a more stable place if all nuclear weapons were abolished.
Russians 60 years of age or older were the biggest supporters _ 67
percent of the elderly Russians believed that eliminating all
nuclear arms would add to international stability.
</P>
<P>
   As for cutbacks, 55 percent of those polled supported
ratification of the START II treaty, which has languished in the
Russian Duma, or parliament, since 1993, and only 25 percent were
opposed. Interestingly, 72 percent of those polled said America
would implement only those treaty provisions of benefit to itself.
</P>
<P>
   Being a nuclear power is linked to global influence, many
Russians believed. Of those polled, 40 percent said Russia will
have a say in world politics if it kept its nuclear weapons; 37
percent thought other nations wouldn't dare attack a nuclear-armed
Russia. Only 23 percent said nuclear weapons were necessary because
developing nuclear technology promotes technical progress.
</P>
<P>
   Almost half of respondents, 47 percent, also thought that Russia
should retain the right to launch a first strike _ which is the
official position of their government. However, a large minority,
38 percent, held the opposite view, and the rest found the question
difficult to answer.
</P>
<P>
   As to politics, people's political preferences generally had
very little impact on the opinions reflected in their answers. But
among the more illuminating data:
</P>
<P>
   __ Seventy-nine percent of those polled who were followers of
Yevgeny M. Primakov, former prime minister and leader of
Fatherland-All Russia, a centrist electoral alliance, said the
United States could not be trusted to act fairly in fulfilling its
international arms-control treaty obligations. Primakov is
currently the most likely competitor to Acting President Vladimir
V. Putin in the March 26 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   __ Twenty-three percent of those polled who were supporters of
Gennadi A. Zyuganov, leader of the Communist Party, maintained that
Russia should have the same number of nuclear weapons as the United
States; 31 percent were sure that Russia needed more. Moreover, his
supporters accounted for the largest number of those opposed to the
six-year-old START II treaty, which calls for the reduction of
nuclear stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
   __ Fifty-four percent of those polled who were followers of
Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, the ultranationalist leader, believed that
Russian nukes should be permanently targeted at certain states.
</P>
<P>
   __ Eighty-seven percent of supporters of Sergei Kiriyenko,
another former prime minister and leader of the Union of Right
Forces, a pro-capitalist group, were sure the world would be less
stable if more countries possessed nuclear weapons.

<P>
   For the first time, an opinion poll reveals what the Russian
public thinks about a wide range of nuclear security issues, from
the Strategic Arms Control Treaty to nuclear smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, ``Examining Attitudes of Russians Towards Nuclear
Weapons and Nuclear Threats,'' was jointly sponsored by Moscow's
Center for Policy Studies in Russia and the Center for
Nonproliferation Studies of the Monterey Institute in California.
</P>
<P>
   It was based on interviews with 1,500 people in 56 localities
throughout the Russian Federation, and was released Nov. 16. The
research was conducted by Fond Obshestvennoye Mneniye _ a well
respected, politically independent Russian polling company.
</P>
<P>
   The survey helps to clarify how Russians think about nuclear
weapons _ including the role they play in world politics, how much
Russia needs them for its own security and how they could be
diverted for use by international terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The results also demonstrate that, as elsewhere, the public on
this issue does not always agree with the official government and
military positions.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the end of the Cold War and a halt to the U.S.-Soviet
superpower arms race, the survey showed that a significant number
of Russians find comfort in their country's nuclear weapons; 77
percent supported the Russian National Security Concept provision
that says: ``Nuclear weapons play a decisive role in providing
national security.''
</P>
<P>
   Of those polled, 24 percent acknowledged that it is costly for
Russia to maintain its nuclear arsenal, but 32 percent said Russia
ought to have as many nukes as the United States _ while 26 percent
supported the idea of a Russia with more nuclear weapons than
America.
</P>
<P>
   As for totally deactivating their nuclear weapons, it wasn't a
popular idea: 82 percent thought Russia's nuclear arsenal must be
on active duty and ready for use; a mere 12 percent said that the
nukes should be kept in storage. Only 18 percent of those polled
thought Russia didn't need any nukes at all.
</P>
<P>
   That such weapons could fall into the hands of the wrong people
weighed heavily on respondents, with fear voiced about possible
sabotage of Russian nuclear facilities, including power plants and
nuclear munitions storage sites _ 90 percent of those polled
expressed such a fear.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the survey was taken after a devastating series of
terrorist bombs in Moscow and other Russian cities killed more than
300 people _ attacks blamed by the Kremlin on Chechen warlords and
bandits, although solid evidence of guilt remains absent. This
continues to be used as rationale for the bloody Russian military
campaign in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the fact that nine out of every 10 of Russian
adults polled said that nuclear sabotage is possible demonstrates
how great the fear is. It also shows how little the Russian people
trust the official statements which claim that ``all strategic
facilities are under control.''
</P>
<P>
   While only 52 percent of those polled expressed concern about a
nuclear attack by foreign states, 86 percent expressed fear that
international terrorists might use nuclear weapons against Russia.
Only 10 percent considered such terrorism to be improbable; only 4
percent had difficulty answering this question, which suggests that
the majority are indeed living with concern about nuclear
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Russians, the poll revealed, simply don't buy the
assurances of their senior government officials that there is no
way for nuclear thieves to steal weapons-grade fissile materials
from domestic nuclear facilities. The majority, 83 percent of
respondents, believed it possible to smuggle such lethal materials
out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Russians generally valued the concept of curbing the spread of
nukes, with 76 percent saying the world would be far less stable if
more countries had nuclear weapons. Education played a role in
this: 81 percent of those with a higher education said nuclear
proliferation would diminish global stability; so did 74 percent of
those with a secondary education and 64 percent with a primary
education.
</P>
<P>
   Even those respondents who believed that world stability could
be improved by the proliferation of nuclear weapons opposed the
idea of selling Russian nuclear arms and technologies abroad.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Russians don't balk at the idea of total world
nuclear disarmament. Of those polled, 57 percent believed the world
would be a more stable place if all nuclear weapons were abolished.
Russians 60 years of age or older were the biggest supporters _ 67
percent of the elderly Russians believed that eliminating all
nuclear arms would add to international stability.
</P>
<P>
   As for cutbacks, 55 percent of those polled supported
ratification of the START II treaty, which has languished in the
Russian Duma, or parliament, since 1993, and only 25 percent were
opposed. Interestingly, 72 percent of those polled said America
would implement only those treaty provisions of benefit to itself.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Although they call it the sweet science, boxing is really more
of an art. Success depends not only upon how hard you hit, but
where and when. As Muhammad Ali so famously pointed out, it's a
dance in which one must float like a butterfly and sting like a
bee.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years that fascinating ritual has inspired some of
the most memorable moments in American cinema.
</P>
<P>
   Who can forget Anthony Quinn going to seed in ``Requiem for a
Heavyweight,'' or Sylvester Stallone going the distance in
``Rocky,'' or Robert De Niro going ballistic in ``Raging Bull''? In
each case, the protagonist faces challenges inside and outside the
ring, and is forced to come to grips with not only his opponents,
but himself.
</P>
<P>
   That the allure of boxing remains undiminished is confirmed by
three new releases: ``The Hurricane,'' opening today, and ``Play It
to the Bone'' and ``Diamonds,'' which bow in theaters next week.
</P>
<P>
   Denzel Washington is widely considered a certain Oscar nominee
for his portrayal of Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter, a boxer falsely
convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison, but ultimately
vindicated. Even though the film contains only a few boxing scenes,
Washington embodies Carter with impressive precision.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the performance merits comparison to De Niro's
Oscar-winning rendering of another real-life fighter, Jake La
Motta, in ``Raging Bull'' (1980). Also, like Stallone's fictional
Rocky Balboa, Washington's Carter has the toughness and tenacity to
overcome seemingly insurmountable odds.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the stuff of boxing, a sport that gave the world such
champions as Ali, Jack Johnson, Jack Dempsey, Sugar Ray Robinson
and Joe Louis. And a sport that, despite controversy and hard
times, continues to resonate in the American consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``More films have been made about boxing than about any other
sport,'' said Bert Sugar, a boxing commentator, historian and
author of numerous books on the subject. Because boxers tend to be
underdogs, audiences find it easy to identify with them, he said.
And the fight game lends itself to a wide range of cinematic
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the canvas of boxing, you can depict anything,'' said
Sugar, who was a consultant to ``Hollywood Heavyweights,'' a recent
film series presented on the Turner Classic Movies cable channel.
``It can be a comedy, it can be a morality play, it can be `Requiem
for a Heavyweight.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Considering the innate appeal of the boxer, it's not surprising
that some of Hollywood's most charismatic actors have put on the
gloves. Errol Flynn, perhaps best remembered as a swashbuckler,
channeled early champion James J. Corbett in ``Gentleman Jim''
(1942). Pretty boy Paul Newman was an appropriately gritty Rocky
Graziano in ``Somebody Up There Likes Me'' (1956), and Elvis
Presley rocked the ring as ``Kid Galahad'' (1962).
</P>
<P>
   In ``Diamonds,'' veteran screen heavy Kirk Douglas plays a
former boxer who goes in search of hidden jewels with his son and
grandson. The film incorporates footage of a much younger Douglas
from the 1949 boxing drama ``Champion.''
</P>
<P>
   But in terms of authenticity, it would be hard to beat Daniel
Day-Lewis' portrayal of an Irish pugilist in ``The Boxer'' (1997),
said Joyce Carol Oates, a well-regarded novelist who is also a
boxing enthusiast.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was she impressed with Day-Lewis, who she said had the
look and attitude of a boxer, but also with ``the fights
themselves. The audiences were very vividly depicted, and you just
had a sense of the fighter's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates, who wrote the book On Boxing, said some boxing films are
much too sentimental about the sport. She called ``Rocky'' (1976),
which won the Academy Award for Best Picture and resulted in four
sequels, ``touching, but it had no more to do with boxing than
`E.T.' has to do with outer space.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only are Stallone's ``Rocky'' films given to melodrama,
Oates said, but in most of them the actor's physique is that of a
bodybuilder, not a fighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real boxers can't be heavy with their muscles,'' Oates said.
``They don't train like weightlifters. So immediately you have the
wrong physical type. It's just phony.''
</P>
<P>
   F.X. Toole, a fight trainer, said realism is indeed a problem in
Hollywood boxing films, which often contain entirely too much
fist-flailing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boxing isn't like that,'' said Toole, author of Rope Burns, a
forthcoming collection of short fiction set in the boxing world.
``Boxing is precise. You don't have time to waste any energy, and
you don't have time to expose yourself to being hit _ because that
other guy is firing back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Play It to the Bone,'' a comedy starring Woody Harrelson and
Antonio Banderas as buddies who are compelled to fight each other,
gets his vote as the worst boxing film ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ring action is very sloppy. Very sloppy. They throw
punches that could kill a mule. It doesn't work that way, and it
really doesn't have to be portrayed that way. Ultimately, it's
simply not believable.''
</P>
<P>
   Silence was golden
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always so. Boxing films go back to the silent era. The
earliest ones _ footage of actual bouts _ were popular in
nickelodeons.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see the early fights on film,'' Oates said, ``you're
seeing a primitive world in which a boxing match might be 100
rounds long _ in the sun. They had no rules about a boxer going to
a neutral corner when his opponent's knocked down.''
</P>
<P>
   By the Great Depression, the sport figured prominently in
feature films. Indeed, that was the heyday of boxing films.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Depression, people were looking for hope,'' Sugar said.
``It was an era when this seamy, smarmy sport and the seamy life of
America seemed to intersect. But most of those movies showed that
somebody who was down on his luck could go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the boxing dramas of the 1930s were ``The Champ'' (1931),
starring Wallace Beery, in an Academy Award-winning performance as
a fighter who must cope with a weepy young son played by Jackie
Cooper; ``Winner Take All'' (1932), starring James Cagney as a
brash prizefighter; and the original ``Kid Galahad'' (1937), with
Edward G. Robinson as a boxing promoter.
</P>
<P>
   Although in the ensuing decades boxing-themed films continued to
be produced, they became less frequent as the sport waned in
popularity, a victim of its violent reputation as well as the
fierce competition from television that led to the closing of
scores of boxing clubs in the 1950s. When Warren Beatty remade the
1941 fantasy ``Here Comes Mr. Jordan'' as ``Heaven Can Wait''
(1978), the central character was changed from a prizefighter to a
football player.
</P>
<P>
   Still, those glory days when boxing was king survive on
celluloid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boxing's dropped off the edge of middle-class society,'' Oates
said. ``Sometime in the 1950s it became associated with outcasts.
But before that we had national heroes _ like Joe Louis.''

 &HT;    Best college essays `strike a chord'
 &HT;    By Michele Chan Santos
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It's the time of year when John Lind's family
likes to tease him.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president for enrollment and management at Southwestern
University in Georgetown is in the thick of application season.
Over the next few months, he'll take applications for admission
home every night, evaluating 10 to 20 on a typical evening, more on
weekends.
</P>
<P>
   His devotion to his work extends to reading essays on the way to
churchSunday morning _ with someone else driving, of course _ thus
earning the good-natured jokes from his family.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Southwestern received 1,495 applications. Of these,
995 students were offered admission. Lind examined virtually every
application personally, doing either the first or second read on
each one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones that tell me about the humanness of the person are
the onesI am most enamored with,'' Lind said. ``You get a lot of
things that are superficial,'' but Lind said it's worth it when you
come upon an essay where ``somebody goes into some depth and you
can see the growth occurring, where they learn something.''
</P>
<P>
   For admissions officers at colleges and universities across the
country, the next six to seven weeks are crunch time, akin to a tax
preparer's workload before April 15 or a sales associate's long
hours before Christmas. It's a particularly intense kind of work.
Consider that most people get burned out talking to three or four
job candidates or interviewing half a dozen prospective tenants for
a garage apartment. Think of examining hundreds or thousands of
applications each year, where your evaluation helps determine
someone's future. How do admissions officials stay fresh? How do
they make sure they're evaluating candidates fairly, and not
discriminating against a student because he or she had the bad luck
to be the 50th file they've read that week?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, admissions workers say, is to pace yourself, have
good training and apply consistent standards. A built-in system
where more than one person, or even a committee of people, reads an
application also helps.
</P>
<P>
   Augustine Garza, deputy director of admissions at the University
of Texas, escapes the hubbub and interruptions at his office and
goes home to read essays. He is one of 20 admissions officials who
altogether will evaluate 16,000 250-word essays this year. Garza
examines seven to eight essays an hour.
</P>
<P>
   After more than 20 years in the admissions business, Garza knows
what he's looking for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to approach each one individually,'' he said. He knows
that even though he may be looking at his 75th essay that week, for
the student, this is only one of the two essays she has written
that will affect whether they are admitted into the university.
``It's imperative that we be as fresh and as fair as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   To guarantee consistency when you have 20 reviewers and
thousands of applicants at one of the largest universities in the
country, each reviewer goes through an annual eight-hour training
session with English professor Brian Breman. The training ensures
that each reader has the same standards, Garza said.
</P>
<P>
   To save time, ``we don't try to reread and analyze each and
every line,'' Garza said. ``We're reading holistically, taking all
things into account.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the similarity of topics, genuine emotion or change
can show through. ``It's rare for essays to be so similar that we
become jaded,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Manier, assistant director of admissions at St. Edward's
University in Austin, tries not to read more than three
applications at one sitting. After an hour and a half _ 30 minutes
per application _ she'll take a break. Over the course of the day,
``once I start to feel fatigued, I put it away and do something
else,'' Manier said.
</P>
<P>
   Applicants to St. Edward's, unlike those to UT, are not given a
word limit on their essays, so they usually run two to three
typewritten pages, about 500 to 750 words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really try to get to know the individual through the
application,'' Manier said. ``That's more difficult if the essay is
very general or if the recommendations aren't very descriptive.''
In a good essay, ``it's pretty easy to figure out how the student
ticks and what their values are and what distinguishes them, what's
important to them. What really impresses me is emotional maturity,
a student who is thinking about things that a normal 18-year-old
doesn't think about.''
</P>
<P>
   For Elizabeth H. Stanley, director of admissions at St.
Edward's, the reads go more easily because she is the second person
to evaluate each application.
</P>
<P>
   A team of counselors _ including Manier _ goes through most of
the applications before Stanley sees them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It saves me from burning out,'' she said. ``Our counselors are
very thorough.'' Still, Stanley reads each essay to get the flavor
of each student's personality _ and generally that means 2,000
essays a year.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the job easier for Stanley is her love of the
admissions process. ``You can't stay in this business if you don't
love what you do,'' Stanley said. ``You would go batty if you were
doing this and you hated it.''
</P>
<P>
   TIPS ON WRITING A COLLEGE APPLICATION ESSAY
</P>
<P>
   _ Take the essay seriously. Many students simply throw together
a few words _ and it shows, said Augustine Garza of UT. The essay
can make a difference in whether you are admitted.
</P>
<P>
   _ Be genuine. Use your own voice. Don't go crazy with the
thesaurus. ``Don't pretend you are something that you're not,''
said Tracy Manier of St. Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use spellcheck. Be careful with your grammar, punctuation and
other basics. A sloppily written essay is annoying, said Elizabeth
Stanley of St. Edward's. ``The student is simply not taking the
time to use the resources at hand.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Read the essay to yourself in front of a mirror. Is it
convincing? Does it make sense?
</P>
<P>
   _ Turn in your own work. ``Parents sometimes rewrite essays for
their kids. I think that's horrible,'' said John Lind of
Southwestern University. ``We're trying to assess how they would
perform here, and I think if they do it that way they don't give us
a realistic assessment.''

 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Not long ago, a straw poll found that if given the
choice between Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, editorial cartoonists would choose the latter. This was a
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Understand, an endorsement from political cartoonists is no
badge of honor. One cartoonist said that his choice for president
likely would be the one ``with the biggest nose.''
</P>
<P>
   If cartoonists were in charge, Ross Perot would be president for
life.
</P>
<P>
   I understand the cartoonists' case against Gore. They're saying
that there's only so many ways to draw a Popsicle stick.
</P>
<P>
   However, judging from the inability thus far of the nation's
cartoonists to get a bead on Bush, I wonder from where any
enthusiasm comes.
</P>
<P>
   Few figures of such note have been missed by such a wide mark by
their caricatures.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem seems to that by and large when the
cartoonists draw George W. they can't distance their imagery from
that of President George H.W. They want to draw W. angular, like
they did his father, whereas W. is more compact, like his mother.
They want to give him his father's chin, which did not get passed
to him.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear that certain other traits of the father didn't get
passed down to the son. Passion for foreign affairs, for one.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas George H.W. had an arm-long Washington resume with
international connections _ CIA director, United Nations
representative, envoy to China, a stint in Congress _ his son comes
before the nation almost blessedly bereft. Is this a point of
pride? Whatever Bush's features, I'm waiting for someone to draw
them with acuity.
</P>
<P>
   Texans have trouble themselves expressing what gives their
favorite son his distinction. He's immensely popular _ 78 percent
approval as governor _ but when asked by the Texas Poll what they
considered his chief accomplishment in office last year, 45 percent
of respondents couldn't come up with anything specific.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has done some important things, like oversee a needed
reform of the juvenile justice system that gave more gravity to
entry-level offenses. Some of his achievements, such as in
education reform, have been tokenistic, built on the backs of those
who set up wholesale education reforms in the 1980s at considerable
political cost.
</P>
<P>
   Bush signed a bill that will put Texas at the forefront of
blunting social promotion through standardized testing. Though
groundbreaking, it came with almost no controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Implementation of charter schools, a professed point of pride
for Bush, has been marked by shoddy oversight, causing many Texans
to gain new appreciation for the role demon bureaucracy plays in
bringing accountability to public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, the bottom line in support for Bush may come down
to good times, a personal amiability quotient, and an ability to
get along with the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   If elected, that amiability would take on marked difference
depending on which party controls Congress. Good-guy Bush in the
White House would be like jail break for GOP House crazies like
Reps. Tom DeLay and Dan Burton.
</P>
<P>
   If the Democrats were to lay claim to Congress, Bush as
president wouldn't declare ``culture war.'' He'd be awaiting them
with a hand to shake.
</P>
<P>
   That is, of course, unless voters and cartoonists come to see
Bush as mostly hat without cattle, and send him back to Texas to
find substance.

 &HT;    Conceding defeat: It's the 21st century
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ I surrender.
</P>
<P>
   For just over a year, I have fought a losing battle against
referring to 2000, the much ballyhooed Y2K, as the beginning of the
21st century or the beginning of the new millennium. I'm waving the
white flag and joining the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   As Dec. 31 approached, I began to feel like a spinster English
teacher trying to force students not to say ``He graduated from
high school,'' and to say what used to be considered the proper
form: ``He was graduated from high school.'' Just as I ignored my
teachers, my reporters routinely ignored me, referring at every
opportunity to 1999 as the last year of the century, the end of the
millennium, etc., etc., ad nauseum. I caught and corrected it when
I could, sent out memos, did everything short of threatening
banishment to covering sixth-grade volleyball games to anyone who
broke the rule. The rule was broken regularly.
</P>
<P>
   I blame President Clinton. He should have come out right at the
get-go and proclaimed 1999 to be the next-to-last year of the 20th
century and the millennium, ideally in his state-of-the-union
address last January. Instead of worrying about whether he was
going to be convicted in his impeachment trial (which now seems
like it happened 10 years ago instead of just 10 months), Wild Bill
should have set everyone straight.
</P>
<P>
   We could have still had the parties, the fireworks, the glitz
and glamour that many of us poor saps were reduced to watching on
television while sitting around the office waiting for midnight to
strike Dec. 31 to see if anything bad would happen to the
computers, the power or the water. Talk about a nonevent. I figure
there were more than a few folks sitting around bored at power
plants and other places who considered flipping a switch and
knocking off the power for a few minutes just to liven things up.
Lucky they didn't, because the rest of us waiting with bated _ and
unusually sober breath for that time of night and date _ would have
probably had a heart attack wondering what was happening. Odds are
good you can pick up a barely used generator pretty cheap this
week, and bottled-water sales have probably gone down the tubes.
</P>
<P>
   Even if this wasn't the dawn of the new millennium, the fact we
were leaving the 1900s was reason enough to have a throw-down, and
then everyone could have geared up for a real millennium bash this
New Year's Eve. And those of us who had to work last New Year's Eve
could have participated, since far as I know there is no Y2K+1 bug
lurking out there.
</P>
<P>
   I knew it was utterly hopeless when my Time magazine arrived
last week. COMMEMORATIVE ISSUE, it proclaimed in fat type.
``January 1, 2000. Welcome to a new century.'' When Time says it's
true, you best give in and go along with the crowd, even if they
are math-challenged.
</P>
<P>
   The argument of the few Luddites holding to their principles (my
former colleagues) is that the calendar starts with ``1.'' There
was no 0 A.D. If you start with ``1,'' then you end a century with
100. Thus, if you start with 1901, you end with 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the fact that the Gregorian calendar had a few minor
adjustments along the way and most biblical scholars believe Jesus
was born in what was actually 4 B.C. skews the whole concept
anyway. Which is one reason I wasn't terribly worried the world
would end at the stroke of midnight. At least not that midnight
anymore than next week, next month or next year.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the Chinese. This is year 5740 on their calendar
_ and the Year of the Dragon, number 5741, doesn't begin until Feb.
5. Did that stop them from partying down? Of course not. Everyone
knows what party animals the Chinese are.
</P>
<P>
   So here we are. At least many of us have learned how to spell
``millennium,'' and a few of us have an awesome supply of canned
goods and bottled water on hand. The world held one heckuva party,
the terrorists didn't raise their slimy heads, and at least for one
day, a meaningless passage of numbers on a calendar seemed to bring
a lot of people together, if just for a little while.
</P>
<P>
   That's not so bad. Let's try it again this New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Happy 21st century, everybody.

 &HT;    Texas Democrats hope to reverse slim GOP advantage in Senate
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Democrats who controlled redistricting of
the Texas Senate last decade did such a good job of packing
Republican-leaning districts with Republican voters that none of
the six Republicans seeking re-election this year drew Democratic
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the only incumbent Republican opposed is Jeff Wentworth
of San Antonio. Wentworth, whose 25th district wanders through the
Hill Country across the western end of Travis County into
Williamson County, is opposed by Libertarian Party candidate George
Meeks, of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Wentworth said Democrats stayed out not only because the
districts are Republican, big and expensive to run in, but also
because the 15 senators elected this year will serve two-year
terms. All 31 senate districts are up in 2002 after redistricting.
</P>
<P>
   With popular Texas Gov. George W. Bush likely to head the GOP
ticket for president this year, Democratic hopefuls will wait for
the redrawn districts and no Bush, Wentworth said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Democrats think they can reverse the current 16-15
Republican advantage in the Senate by holding Senate District 2,
represented by Democrat David Cain of Dallas, and picking up Senate
District 3 in deep East Texas, originally drawn for a Democrat.
Republicans, as might be expected, think they have a chance not
only to hold onto their edge, but add the seat Cain now holds.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sen. Drew Nixon of Carthage, the incumbent in
District 3, was embarrassed during the 1997 legislative session
after offering to pay for sex with a woman on South Congress Avenue
who turned out to be a cop. Nixon had hinted he'd seek re-election,
despite urging by state GOP Chairwoman Susan Weddington to quit. He
finally decided not to run.
</P>
<P>
   Three Republicans had already filed for the nomination, which
probably helped Nixon decide. They are state Rep. Todd Staples of
Palestine, homebuilder Les Tarrance of Conroe and building
contractor Van Brookshire of Coldspring.
</P>
<P>
   The lone Democrat is lawyer David Fisher of Silsbee. Fisher is
the grandson of longtime U.S. District Judge Joe Fisher, and he has
been campaigning for months, which helped keep other Democrats out
of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Republican and Democratic operatives agree that of the eight
districts in which Democrats are seeking re-election, the only one
truly in play is District 2, which stretches from Dallas to Tyler.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Cain of Dallas has represented the district since
winning it by just one percentage point in 1994. Three Republicans
want to oppose him:
</P>
<P>
   _ Richard Harvey of Tyler, who has run unsuccessfully five times
for the seat. He was the GOP nominee narrowly beaten by Cain in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keith Wheeler of Rockwall, a lawyer who lost a race for
district judge in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bob Deuell of Greenville, a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   In the other eight districts represented by Democrats, three
senators _ Eddie Lucio Jr. of Brownsville, Eliot Shapleigh of El
Paso and Gonzalo Barrientos of Austin _ escaped Republican
opposition. Barrientos is opposed by Libertarian Party candidate
Tom Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Sen. Leticia Van de Putte, who won a special election
to replace the late Gregory Luna in San Antonio's 26th District,
will face lawyer David Leibowitz in the Democratic primary.
Republican Mark Weber's filing was undone because he mistakenly
filed with state GOP headquarters rather than in Bexar County, as
required for a district wholly within a county.
</P>
<P>
   These Democratic incumbents are expected to withstand Republican
challenges:
</P>
<P>
   _ District 12 (Fort Worth): Mike Moncrief, opposed by
businessman George Host.
</P>
<P>
   _ District 15 (Houston): John Whitmire, opposed by Warren A.
Lawless of Humble, who listed himself as a ``customer engineer.''
</P>
<P>
   _ District 21 (San Antonio to Laredo): Judith Zaffirini of
Laredo, opposed by insurance agent David Swift of San Antonio.

 &HT;    Computers creating new class of hot jobs for 21st century
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Technology is adding a new twist to some old jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Take concierges, for instance. At the Atlanta-based Ritz-Carlton
hotel chain, guests with computer problems have 24-hour-a-day
access to ``computer butlers,'' or compcierges as they're called by
Los Angeles-based career management Web site Careerpath
</P>
<P>
   .com.
</P>
<P>
   The job is one of the 17 hottest for the 21st century, according
to Careerpath.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no longer good enough to greet people with a warm smile
and deliver hot towels to their rooms,'' says Anne Gregor,
editorial director at Careerpath.com. ``A concierge will now need
to know how to plug in computers, help people with their cell
phones and other technical appliances with which they travel.''
</P>
<P>
   The same technological savvy applies to television show set
designers _ now known as virtual set designers _ and disaster
relief workers, Gregor says.
</P>
<P>
   ``A television set designer is becoming a digital maven, someone
who can create a set within a computer on the screen as opposed to
real life,'' Gregor said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, rescue teams, or pararescuers, at last fall's
devastating earthquake in Turkey showed how their role has grown
exponentially with technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``No longer is it sheer brute manpower with bulldozers,'' Gregor
said. ``These teams arrive with highly sophisticated computers to
monitor the slightest sound in hopes of being able to find people
who might not have been rescued in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the hottest jobs, what they could pay and what
you'll need to get them:
</P>
<P>
   COMPCIERGE
</P>
<P>
   Essentially on call for 55 percent of hotel guests who travel
with laptop computers. These jobs are expected to skyrocket from a
handful today to one in nearly every major hotel by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Prep work: The Ritz-Carlton requires at least one year of
help-desk management and a bachelor's degree in computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   Pay: $40,000-plus
</P>
<P>
   E-COMMERCE ACCOUNTANT
</P>
<P>
   Determines when it makes financial sense to go online to sell
goods. Offers advice on finding Web developers and managing credit
card and sales records and makes sure your site is hacker-free.
</P>
<P>
   Prep work: Bachelor of science degree in accounting plus state
certification as a public accountant. Understanding of software and
Internet technology.
</P>
<P>
   Pay: $28,500 to $54,250
</P>
<P>
   BIOINFORMATICIST
</P>
<P>
   Studies gene maps and deciphers which gene can help an orange,
for example, withstand colder weather. As the importance of
manipulating plant genes increases, so will demand for this job.
</P>
<P>
   Prep work: Biology and computer science. You should have a
bachelor's in computational biology or a bachelor's in computer
science with a doctorate in genetics.
</P>
<P>
   Pay: $75,000 to $100,000-plus
</P>
<P>
   VIRTUAL SET DESIGNER
</P>
<P>
   Combine a decor built on a computer with a physical space. With
future production budgets spread thin, virtual sets will allow TV
companies to tape many shows in the same studio.
</P>
<P>
   Prep work: Architecture, 3-D computer modeling and experience
working in traditional set design.
</P>
<P>
   Pay: $60,000- $150,000
</P>
<P>
   PARARESCUER
</P>
<P>
   Sent on humanitarian missions to provide aid during natural
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Prep work: Fitness test and training. Swim class weeds out most:
When the examiner ties up hands and feet to teach drown-proofing, a
lot of people realize the job is not for them.
</P>
<P>
   Pay: $29,000 to $45,000.
</P>
<P>
   DATA MAPPER
</P>
<P>
   Translates information such as crime and traffic on maps and
points out patterns and problems.
</P>
<P>
   Prep work: Geographic information system specialists need
expertise in information systems, computer science or public
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Pay: $30,000 to $40,000

 &HT;    Jackson takes bumpy trip in stride
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Nothing surprises Jim Jackson anymore. Trade him
tomorrow. Trade the entire team. You can't surprise him. Jackson
picks up the paper, sees Hawks president Stan Kasten's
fire-and-brimstone message to his underachieving team and shrugs.
Been there; done that. Jackson is like the phoenix, symbol of the
city of Atlanta: His career has been rebuilt time and time again
from the ashes of his previous stop. Once thought of as an
insurance policy in the Isaiah Rider-Steve Smith trade, the former
lottery pick has emerged as the key player for the Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is playing 37 minutes a game, is the team's
second-leading scorer at 18 points per game and is second in the
NBA in 3-point shooting at .491. He appears to have found a home
with the Hawks and said he hopes to remain in Atlanta for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson did not ask to become a Hawk and wasn't particularly
thrilled about coming here after sacrificing and reaching the
Western Conference finals with Portland last spring. But unlike his
friend Rider, he did not indulge in a fit of kicking and screaming;
he came in and resolved to make the best of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them, `So, based on what you're telling me, I'm an
insurance policy for J.R.,' and (general manager Pete Babcock)
said, `Yeah.' Well, they didn't know it, but I resolved that I was
going to make the best of it. I wasn't going to be a bench guy if I
could help it. I was going to start, and I was going to be a good
teammate and compete and try to help them win.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1992, when Dallas selected him with the fourth pick
of the draft but refused to pay him No. 4 money _ he sat out more
than 50 games demanding fair treatment _ it's been one wrong turn
after another for Jackson, but he has survived each one.
</P>
<P>
   From Dallas to Philadelphia to New Jersey to Golden State to
Portland to Atlanta in the span of 30 months. The man is an
encyclopedia for apartment living. Need to know the market? Don't
call a realtor. Call Jim Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a hard lesson in the business of basketball my rookie
year,'' he said Tuesday, knees encased in bags of ice. ``It's
taught me a lot over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   He survived the breakup of the celebrated three J's _ Jackson,
Jason Kidd and Jamal Mashburn _ who actually played 69 games as a
starting, functioning unit.
</P>
<P>
   He survived the damage to his reputation when he and his close
friend Kidd were allegedly seeing the same woman, singer Toni
Braxton, only the truth is that neither player ever met her. ``I
never met her,'' he said. ``It was all her (public relations)
stunt.''
</P>
<P>
   And on to a half-season in Jersey. A half-season in Philly. A
season with Golden State, then the promise of a three-year tenure
in Portland that lasted six months.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Jackson remains whole as a person, refusing to
give in to the bitterness and distrust he feels toward basketball
management. He realizes that if the Bulls could take the best from
Scottie Pippen and toss him away after six championships, he has no
clout.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Bulls owner) Jerry Reinsdorf can finally give Michael
(Jordan) the $30 million he deserves and say he's going to regret
doing it, you know that's the business,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, underscore nothing, is going to ruin the game for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to keep everything in perspective,'' Jackson said. ``In
reality, basketball doesn't mean anything. We place so much
emphasis on the ring and winning the championship. And there are
some guys today who have that ring, and they don't have anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``That ring can't get you what you need to be successful in
life. I don't care if you've got 11 like Bill Russell or if you've
got six like Michael; it doesn't matter. In the end, basketball is
just a game. I love to play and I love to win, but I've got to keep
everything in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   A history buff, Jackson knows something about the world.
``You've got people over in Europe getting hijacked or don't have
food, got bombs going off around them. You've got people in the
United States who don't have a place to live, children out on the
streets, and I'm going to get stressed out worrying about a
basketball game where my life is pretty much taken care of? No.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows that his position is not like real life. ``I get
traded, I'm going to another team. I'm still playing. I may not
like the other team, and I may not like the situation I'm in, but
that check is still coming in and I'm doing what I love to do. But
the average person who gets laid off or gets fired, or gets evicted
from their house, a death in the family creates loss of income,
you're now a single parent, you don't know what the future
holds....
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I gonna get frustrated and not enjoy life? No. For a while
I didn't, and I let some years slip by without having fun just
because of circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   It started to change for Jackson last winter when he went to
Portland and discovered winning for the first time in his career
after being with teams that were a collective 135-299, never having
participated in a playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a lot of it back last year,'' he said. ``I got more
favorable publicity last year for playing 20 minutes and scoring
less than 10 points than I did the previous three years. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Even this year, when we're not going the way I or management
or the coaching staff would have envisioned it, the desire and love
is there. ... When you think about all the things that could be
wrong, all the things that plague society. I mean, if I had a fatal
disease. Or I couldn't see or I couldn't walk. So my knees hurt, so
what? Go and get them (treated) and play....
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm done, I'm done,'' he said. ``There will be a time
when I can't play anymore, but I'm not going to look back and see
lost opportunities.''

 &HT;    Son follows in father's footsteps, setting up success with
bio-tech companies
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Marc Gorlin graduated from the University of
Georgia in the summer of 1995, his father offered some interesting
advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him the worst thing you can do is find a job. I told
him to find a deal,'' said Steve Gorlin. But first, the elder
Gorlin offered his son the chance to take his time and learn the
family business.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Gorlin is a financier responsible for seeding several
well-established Atlanta biotechnology companies, including CytRx,
Theragenics and SurgiVision.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Gorlin, 27, has since helped start three technology-related
companies, two of which were sold within two years. The third,
Lanta Technology Group of Atlanta, finds people to flesh out other
technology start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   By taking his father's advice, finding deals instead of jobs,
the Atlanta native has amassed a career's worth of experience in
little more than four years. Part of that breadth and depth is made
possible by the fast pace at which modern technology companies are
evolving in Atlanta. But part comes from taking a father's advice
and applying it to a new generation.
</P>
<P>
   And it started on a bus outside Newark, N.J.:
</P>
<P>
   It is January 1996. Father and son are on their way to Manhattan
to look at a deal. Marc is reading the newspaper. He learns that
the Department of Justice has dropped its case against a man who
developed a way to encrypt e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip Zimmerman's software tool, Pretty Good Privacy, allowed
someone to send information that could be read only by the intended
recipient, the Internet version of ``eyes only.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government, however, considered encryption
technology a munition. Posting the program on the Internet _ where
it could be downloaded by anyone, anywhere _ violated export laws.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Justice Department dropped the case, Zimmerman hoped to
build a company around it. He was looking for money, either formal
venture capital or private investment.
</P>
<P>
   Gorlin, reading the story, thought, ``This guy is smart enough
to write a code that (ticked) off the government this much. It
seemed logical that companies would want encryption software to
protect their information.''
</P>
<P>
   His father's advice: Call the guy.
</P>
<P>
   Gorlin was 23 and five months out of college. He knew little
about encryption technology and less about writing code. His
business experience was limited to a college venture offering tours
from a rented airplane of downtown Athens, Ga., and Kenny Rogers'
farm.
</P>
<P>
   So what did the young Gorlin say to convince a then 41-year-old
man who had almost gone broke fighting the government to take him
seriously?
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `My Dad and I do these kinds of deals. I really admire
what you've done, and we think you've got an awesome brand. It
would make a lot of sense to turn it into a company, and we'd like
to be a part of helping you do it,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think he trusted me,'' Gorlin said. ``Trust is so
important in things, and so often it gets overlooked.''
</P>
<P>
   Within a week, Gorlin and his father were on a plane to Boulder,
Colo. The Gorlins helped gather investors willing to put just under
$10 million in Pretty Good Privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Gorlin said he helped by showing his son how to write a
presentation to pitch potential investors. Then he gave him a list
of names of people who had invested in his deals before.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad gave me the credibility initially,'' Gorlin said. ``But
then he backed off.''
</P>
<P>
   Pretty Good Privacy was launched in San Mateo, Calif., in 1996.
Marc Gorlin took a seat on the board of directors but kept a home
in Atlanta. He worked on business development, talking to e-mail
software firms about integrating PGP into their programs. He helped
recruit and hire the eventual 60 employees. And he sat in on talks
for strategic agreements and participated in the negotiations that
led to PGP's buyout.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1997, PGP was bought by Network Associates, for
about $36 million plus warrants.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman is now Network Associates' resident visionary. He and
Marc Gorlin still talk regularly. He said he remembers being
surprised at the confidence Gorlin showed at such a young age. He
said Steve Gorlin played a stronger role at first, but eased off as
his son learned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of surprising, a guy this young,'' Zimmerman said.
``But over time, I saw how he could raise money and help run a
company. Over the course of a year or so, I saw him become more
sophisticated and saw how he grew into the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorlin knows age can bring experience, ``but when it comes to
making basic decisions, common sense is a pretty good guide.''
</P>
<P>
   After PGP was sold, Gorlin focused on his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1998, Gorlin met Greg Malever, who had an idea for a
staffing company.
</P>
<P>
   Gorlin said he learned from his experience with PGP that finding
the right people is one of the keys to starting a successful
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these companies are getting put together, but the biggest
resource no one has is people,'' Gorlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Over lunch they sketched a business plan on a
chicken-wing-stained napkin.
</P>
<P>
   Gorlin and Malever started Lanta Technology Group early that
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Within three months, it was profitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Malever had a different idea,'' Gorlin said. ``I know it
sounds cheesy, but it's not. We not only interview people for their
skill sets, we sit down with them, understand their interests,
pinpoint their skills and learn about their personalities. Common
interests make a difference when you're working.''
</P>
<P>
   Lanta also occasionally will take an equity stake in a young
company instead of a placement fee.
</P>
<P>
   The firm has placed people at more than 35 Internet or
technology companies including BellSouth.net, eTour, HSupply.com
and Internet Security Systems, an adaptive network security firm.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Klaus, the 26-year-old founder of ISS and a colleague of
Gorlin's, said technology firms will pay to find good employees
because speed is so important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time to market is essential,'' Klaus said. ``If you can save
time and get a list of candidates with the qualifications you're
looking for, it reduces that time. Lanta has done a good job of
finding good people.''
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, in the fall of 1998, Malever was talking to
Gregg Freishtat, then at Premiere Technologies, about placing some
Lanta candidates. Freishtat had an idea that he said would do for
personal information on the Internet what sites like Yahoo did for
general information: organize it. Vertical One would be a company
with a technology that would let people reach all their Internet
accounts from one site with one password.
</P>
<P>
   But Freishtat didn't have the technology. Malever suggested he
call Gorlin. Within a few weeks, Gorlin was helping Freishtat raise
money, find office space and round out his management team.
</P>
<P>
   Gorlin helped raise $16 million over two rounds of venture
capital. He created a security council, which included PGP creator
Zimmerman. He helped attract Klaus to the Vertical One board. He
interviewed prospects and conducted background checks. He also
helped convince the people who run Web sites that Vertical One's
prototype actually could work.
</P>
<P>
   In September, S1, an Atlanta company that helps banks offer
their services online, said it was buying Vertical One for what was
then more than $166 million worth of stock. The price has since
almost doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Gorlin participated in the negotiations over the course of
several weeks in August and September.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, he stepped down as Vertical One's executive
vice president and is back to focusing on Lanta. For now.
</P>
<P>
   Which follows more of his father's advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't really make any money unless you multiply
yourself,'' Steve Gorlin said. ``A doctor can only see so many
patients. A lawyer can only have so many clients. If you really
want to grow, have a company and have other people work for you. I
`D and D' _ delegate and disappear.''

   A few months later, in the fall of 1998, Malever was talking to
Gregg Freishtat, then at Premiere Technologies, about placing some
Lanta candidates. Freishtat had an idea that he said would do for
personal information on the Internet what sites like Yahoo did for
general information: organize it. Vertical One would be a company
with a technology that would let people reach all their Internet
accounts from one site with one password.
</P>
<P>
   But Freishtat didn't have the technology. Malever suggested he
call Gorlin. Within a few weeks, Gorlin was helping Freishtat raise
money, find office space and round out his management team.
</P>
<P>
   Gorlin helped raise $16 million over two rounds of venture
capital. He created a security council, which included PGP creator
Zimmerman. He helped attract Klaus to the Vertical One board. He
interviewed prospects and conducted background checks. He also
helped convince the people who run Web sites that Vertical One's
prototype actually could work.
</P>
<P>
   In September, S1, an Atlanta company that helps banks offer
their services online, said it was buying Vertical One for what was
then more than $166 million worth of stock. The price has since
almost doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Gorlin participated in the negotiations over the course of
several weeks in August and September.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, he stepped down as Vertical One's executive
vice president and is back to focusing on Lanta. For now.
</P>
<P>
   Which follows more of his father's advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't really make any money unless you multiply
yourself,'' Steve Gorlin said. ``A doctor can only see so many
patients. A lawyer can only have so many clients. If you really
want to grow, have a company and have other people work for you. I
`D and D' _ delegate and disappear.''

   EDITORIAL-ELIAN _ Janet Reno clarified Elian Gonzales' legal
situation by brushing aside Florida judge's interference.
Immigration, after all, is a federal matter. Now she needs to
expedite adjudication. Elian has been separated from his father
long enough. Besides, opportunists are preparing to confer U.S.
citizenship on Elian when Congress reconvenes Jan. 24. (Atlanta

   BORDERS-COLUMN _ NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ I surrender. For just over
a year, I have fought a losing battle against referring to 2000,
the much ballyhooed Y2K, as the beginning of the 21st century or
the beginning of the new millennium. I'm waving the white flag and
joining the crowd. (Gary Borders is editor and publisher of the
Nacogdoches Daily Sentinel.) EMBARGOED for Sunday. MOVED

   MCNEELY-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ The Democrats who controlled
redistricting of the Texas Senate last decade did such a good job
of packing Republican-leaning districts with Republican voters that
none of the six Republicans seeking re-election this year drew
Democratic opposition. (McNeely, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ Judging from the inability thus far
of the nation's cartoonists to get a bead on Bush, I wonder from
where any enthusiasm comes. Few figures of such note have been
missed by such a wide mark by their caricatures. (John Young is

Feldman, a professor psychology at Georgia Tech. ``And any society
wants to reduce the amount of violence. But is therapy the way to
do that?'' His question implies something the sociologist Philip

A BEAUTIFUL PERSON IS GONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My refrain for him was always the same. (itals)Not
Bobby.(unitals) That's because Bobby Phills was the exception to
every cliche you've heard about pro athletes. He was so exceptional
that his college basketball coach, Ben Jobe, even begged him not to
play in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Self-important and rude? Not Bobby. Consumed with cash and
repulsed by the classroom? Not Bobby. No sense of perspective? Not
Bobby.
</P>
<P>
   And so Wednesday, just after 1 p.m., I wanted to say the same
thing when I heard the news of a Charlotte Hornets guard, killed
instantly around 11:30 a.m. after his black Porsche was involved in
a three-car accident outside Charlotte Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)Not Bobby. Please. Not Bobby.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Ray Phills II, who was leaving a Hornets shootaround, was
the driver of the Porsche. He was 30.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between pro athletes and sportswriters is
supposed to be purely professional, but Phills made objectivity
impossible for me. I first met him in 1992 when we both worked in
Ohio. Believe me, all the things that will be said about him in his
eulogy will be true; he was a beautiful person.
</P>
<P>
   Some days I sit before a keyboard and write, trying to better
understand myself and the place I live. But, at this moment, it's
difficult. I guess I will never comprehend why so many gentle souls
pass away at a young age.
</P>
<P>
   Phills was not much older than I, but it always seemed that way
to me. Once again, I think it had to do with defying cliches. He
was not a typical Generation Xer at 23. Even then, he talked about
having a family and treating people with respect. I'll never forget
walking into the Cleveland Cavaliers' locker room and seeing
Phills, John Battle, and John ``Hot Rod'' Williams having an
``argument.'' The dispute was over dominoes. The three of them
loved playing Bones, as Phills called them, and would spend hours
on the road challenging each other to yet another game.
</P>
<P>
   I remember that I used to ask Phills silly questions, just so I
could hear him speak. He was extremely bright and he spoke in an
exquisite Southern accent (he was raised in Baton Rouge, La.). He
had a lot of time to talk in '92 because he was locked on Lenny
Wilkens's bench in Cleveland. Wilkens always said that Phills was
the team's best dunker and that he had a future in the league, but
he didn't give him much playing time.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't go over well with Jobe, who coached Phills at
Southern University. There, the 6-foot-5-inch guard was nicknamed
``The Natural.'' He had 5 percent body fat and, although his jump
shot was an awkward line drive, he could jump over anybody. That's
the way sports fans described him. Non-sports fans who happened to
be females put it a different way: Bobby Phills looked good in a
suit. Jobe, though, was more concerned about his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart will feel better,'' the coach once said, ``when he's
Dr. Bobby Phills.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is another way of saying he wanted Phills to be like his
father. The elder Phills was a dean at Southern. His wife, Mary,
was a postal worker. Their rules were simple. Bobby could play
basketball and tennis, shoot pool and bowl as much as he wanted.
But he would have to maintain a B average at all times. He missed
the cut once. In college, he graduated with a 3.2 grade-point
average in animal science. If he hadn't made it to the NBA, he
would have most likely studied at Cornell in an attempt to become a
veterinarian.
</P>
<P>
   As smart, handsome, and rich as he was, there was no pretense to
him. He liked to talk about his family and his sweetheart, Kendall,
who in 1994 became his wife. During the 1993-94 season _ his first
good season with the Cavs _ he talked about Kendall constantly and
told me how much he wanted me to meet her. By chance, I saw him at
a movie theater in the offseason and Kendall was with him. He
stopped everything he was doing and excitedly introduced her. Bobby
Phills had a way of making you feel important.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, I thought of Kendall, her 3-year-old son Bobby Ray
Phills III, and her 1-year-old daughter Kerstie. I thought of Dr.
Phills and his wife and the conversation they had in 1969 before
Bobby was born. At the time, Dr. Phills was a young soldier on his
way to Vietnam. Mary was pregnant. The soldier was not sure if he
would see his wife again, so the decision was made then that if a
male child were born he would be named after his father. And that
he would be a special baby.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot imagine what the Phills's grieving must be like now,
but they should know that they raised a practical and pleasant son.
I knew how to get a laugh out of him. All I had to do was tell him
what Phil Jackson called him. Jackson, who was coaching the Bulls,
often referred to him as ``Bobby Phelps.'' This made Phills laugh.
``Sometimes I go in the game,'' he said in '94, ``and I know guys
are wondering, `Who is Bobby Phills?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The last time I talked with him was on Nov. 5, before the
Celtics played the Hornets at the FleetCenter. I was having a
conversation with someone else when he walked by. I tried to stop
him and have him join the discussion, but Bobby wasn't like that.
He would have felt that he was interrupting. So he kept walking and
spoke the last words I ever heard from him. I thought of those
words over and over Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep talking,'' Phills said that day, ``I'll catch up with you
later.''

TELESCO ISN'T INTIMIDATED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Telesco had a word for what he was trying to
describe Wednesday. He just couldn't come up with it.
</P>
<P>
   That awkward moment was how most of Roy Jones Jr.'s opponents
have responded when they had to come up with the punches to defeat
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people get . . . ah . . . animated . . . ah . . . ah
. . . scared,'' Telesco said when asked to describe the key to the
light heavyweight champion's long string of successes in the ring.
``Scared. Overwhelmed. Because people say this and people say that
about Roy Jones being the greatest pound for pound in the world and
they listen and believe. They get . . . intimidated! There you
go.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what most boxing experts expect will be Telesco's fate
Saturday night when he tries to take the undisputed 175-pound title
from Jones at Radio City Music Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Never has that venerable old building hosted a boxing match and
never in the world does anyone expect Telesco to leave it as light
heavyweight champion. No one but Telesco and perhaps his promoter,
the legendary Don Elbaum, who said Wednesday he bet $2,000 on his
fighter at 12-1 before he arrived in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The hard punching No. 2-rated Telesco understands this general
lack of faith in him. He understands it every time he looks at the
fight poster HBO has produced for the bout, a poster which features
only one man's picture on it.
</P>
<P>
   The picture is not of David Telesco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel I've been given no respect,'' a tight-lipped
Telesco said at a press conference that Jones was nearly two hours
late for. ``The writers have. Some writers have. But HBO? No.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish not to talk abt but they got one guy on the
poster. I know he's the champion but he's fighting somebody. But
it's not only that.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever else it is, Telesco chose to keep it to himself.
Although he was talking, he wasn't saying much about himself or his
life. He only briefly touched upon the long prison term he served
at the Mid-State Correctional Facility in Utica, N.Y., a few years
back for drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't even talk much about Jones, except to promise that
unlike so many of Jones's previous victims he will not share their
. . . what was that word again?
</P>
<P>
   ``Intimidation . . . there you go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Each opponent is different,'' said Telesco (23-2, 19 KOs). ``I
watched all of his on tape and took from each what they lacked to
make sure I won't lack anything. What I got (that they didn't) is
courage and determination.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is 40-1 with 33 knockouts and the only loss was a
disqualification that came after he'd knocked Montell Griffin off
his feet and chose to add some extra curricular punctuation after
he landed on his shorts. In the rematch that followed only months
later, Griffin lasted less than one round.
</P>
<P>
   Telesco talked briefly of a high school football career in which
he was an All-State halfback out of Port Chester, N.Y., whose
problems with his high school coach led him to the ring. What led
him to a 1,600-man prison facility was easier to explain.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs and poverty. Or rather the other way around. It was, in a
sense, a business decision that went bad, and it took away a part
of his life. But now Telesco is working under the illusion the same
can be true for Jones.
</P>
<P>
   He could, in theory, find he made a bad business decision
himself in agreeing to fight Telesco after more than a year of
being pursued by him. He could pay for that with a long night and
maybe even the loss of a title fight.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones gave no indication he feared that possibility. As the
champion talked and joked in a ballroom at the New York Hilton,
Telesco sat glaring out from behind a pair of dark glasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel deep down in my heart this is where I was supposed to
be since Day 1,'' Telesco growled. ``I had a dream about how this
fight is going to end, but I won't say what it was until the end
comes.''
</P>
<P>
   Telesco said those words with Jones in another room. The
question he must face is what he will say when Jones is in the same
room with him Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of guys before him have found Jones can make that a very
small room with dim lighting. Which, of course, quickly leads to
one thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intimidation. There you go.''

WOMEN HAVE HEART ATTACKS, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was one thing my friend Sarah didn't have to worry about.
A doctor had once looked her right in the eye and said, ``Well, I
can tell you this much. You're never going to die of a heart
attack!''
</P>
<P>
   Sarah and I are in the same aerobics class and she never even
gets winded. She's 58, and her slim, well-muscled body is a result
of running 5 miles, rollerblading 7 miles, or riding her bike for
20 miles on alternate days. She has outstanding figures for
triglycerides and homocysteine as well as perfect numbers for
cholesterol. Remarkably, her good cholesterol is higher than the
bad, a blood-lipid profile a professional athlete would envy. This
coming summer she had planned to bicycle coast to coast with a
group, and in her mind she hasn't yet started training.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, however, as Sarah was running up a hill, she felt
as if someone were pressing
</P>
<P>
   a brick against her chest right where a pendant on a chain might
fall. ``I felt pressure at the base of my throat,'' she explains,
``and I said to the person I was with, `I can't run anymore. I have
to walk.' It wasn't hugely painful, and when I stopped, it stopped.
But it kept happening whenever I exercised.'' That was at the
beginning of August.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, Sarah saw her physician's assistant. Since Sarah's
ex-husband had died of lung cancer, she requested a chest X-ray,
which showed nothing. The assistant treated her for bronchitis.
When the pressure persisted, the assistant prescribed an inhaler
for asthma. Still no relief. Sarah, who'd started having stomach
pains, thought it might be esophagitis and was referred to a
gastroenterologist. The first thing he said to her in tones of
disbelief was, ``Are you telling me you're a 58-year-old woman with
chest pains and you haven't had a stress test?''
</P>
<P>
   You may think I'm about to blame someone for this oversight, but
the denial about heart disease in women is so profound that it
extends far beyond issues of individual responsibility. Most women
do not know that heart attacks kill more females than stroke, lung
cancer, and breast cancer combined. Doctors, too, underestimate the
danger. According to the article ``Women and Heart Attacks'' in
November's Fortune magazine, 88 percent of primary care doctors did
not know that the symptoms of heart attack in females are
substantially different from males, and one-third were unaware that
heart attacks are the number-one cause of death in women. It's no
wonder Sarah wasn't given a stress test until her fourth visit to a
doctor.
</P>
<P>
   After various tests, including a stress test, Sarah was finally
told she'd had a mild heart attack. She was put on beta blockers,
given nitroglycerin pills, and encourged to continue to exercise.
Sarah's grown childen were the ones who insisted she get a second
opionion.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until Sarah asked her primary physician face-to-face
what he would do in her place that he answered: ``I'd have a heart
catheterization to determine the extent of the damage to your
heart.'' In late December, five months after her first symptom,
doctors finally discovered that Sarah had significant blockage on
the left side of her heart, as well as lesser blockage on the right
and in her carotid artery. ``The first words out of my doctor's
mouth,'' Sarah says, ``were `I'm flabbergasted!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike men, who often experience chest-crushing pain, women with
heart attacks are more likely to suffer nausea, exhaustion, or
breathlessness, have mild chest discomfort or abdominal pain like
Sarah, or experience pain in their jaws or backs. Studies show that
up to 45 percent of heart attacks are dismissed by women as
inconsequential and never reported. Odder still, the vast majority
of women who have heart attacks keep that fact a secret.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah herself confided only in her family members. She was proud
of her strength and endurance and hated feeling old and weak. As a
management consultant, she was also worried that her colleagues
might think she could no longer handle the demands of her job, so
she kept the fact that she would soon be having an angioplasty
under wraps.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah didn't decide to share her story with my readers until she
read in Fortune that not a single prominent woman in America has
ever admitted to having a heart attack, as Betty Ford did with
breast cancer. As a result of this information blackout, studies
show that women tend to take fewer preventive actions, minimize
their symptoms, call their doctors later, demand and receive less
aggressive treatment, lack female support groups, and are more
likely to die of a heart attack than men.
</P>
<P>
   This can only be remedied by education, by openness, by
courageous women willing to share what a heart attack can teach you
about surviving.
</P>
<P>
   You couldn't find a better role model than Sarah.
</P>

NO CHILD BELONGS IN CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elian Gonzalez is not the first Cuban child to arrive in the
United States without his parents. From the earliest days of the
Castro dictatorship, Cubans have gone to desperate extremes to
smuggle their children to freedom. Between December 1960 and
October 1962, more than 14,000 unaccompanied Cuban children were
sneaked off the island _ with their anguished parents' blessings _
in an exodus that came to be called ``Operation Peter Pan.'' Many
of those parents never saw their children again.
</P>
<P>
   All other things being equal, children belong with their
parents. But all other things have not been equal in Cuba since
1959. All other things can never be equal in a country that treats
children _ by law _ as political raw material to be exploited by
the state. In the civilized world, parents are entrusted with the
freedom of shaping their children's values and guiding their
education. But in Castro's Caribbean paradise, parents who try to
raise their children according to the dictates of conscience have
been punished with impoverishment, imprisonment _ and worse.
</P>
<P>
   This is from Article 3 of Law No. 16, Cuba's Code of the Child:
``The communist formation of the young generation is a valued
aspiration of the state, the family, the teachers, the political
organizations, and the mass organizations that act in order to
foster in youth the ideological values of communism.''
</P>
<P>
   And from Article 5: ``Society and the state watch to ascertain
that all persons who come in contact with the child . . .
constitute an example for the development of his communist
personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Article 8: ``Society and the state work for the efficient
protection of youth against all influences contrary to their
communist formation.''
</P>
<P>
   Article 33: ``The state grants special attention to the teaching
of Marxism-Leninism due to its importance in the ideological
formation and political culture of young students.''
</P>
<P>
   The Code of the Child proceeds like this through dozens of
sections. ``The words are very long and boring,'' says Alberto
Luzarraga of the New Jersey-based Cuban American Research Group.
``But their meaning is inhuman. They mean that in Cuba, the real
parent is the Marxist state.''
</P>
<P>
   If Cuba were a normal country, no one would dispute that Elian
would be better off with his father than anywhere else. But Cuba is
not a normal country, and if Elian is forced to return, he will not
enjoy a normal childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Send Elian back and he will be allowed to live with his father
until he is 11; thereafter he will be sent to work in a farm-labor
camp for 45 to 60 days per year.
</P>
<P>
   Send Elian back and he will face compulsory military service
until he is 27.
</P>
<P>
   Send Elian back and he will be indoctrinated in the glories of
``the revolution'' and taught to regard any Cubans who reject
Castroism _ including his dead mother _ as counterrevolutionaries
and traitors.
</P>
<P>
   Send Elian back and he will be allowed to attend college only if
his ``political attitude and social conduct'' _ to quote the
relevant Cuban law _ satisfy the regime in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba occupies a permanent slot on Freedom House's yearly
tabulation of the most unfree states in the world. It ranks with
the likes of Afghanistan, Burma, North Korea, Syria, and Vietnam as
one of the planet's most repressive nations. It is the sort of
country that people hurl themselves into the sea by the thousands
to escape. How could it be in the best interest of a child who
escaped such a wretched place to be forced to go back?
</P>
<P>
   And that is not even to mention the gaping deprivations of Cuban
life _ the shortages of everything from milk to medicine, the
severe rationing of soap and meat, the lack of toothpaste and
anesthesia.
</P>
<P>
   A parade of American pundits and editorialists, not to mention
the deep thinkers at the Immigration and Naturalization Service,
have been arguing in recent weeks that for his own good, Elian
belongs in Cuba. But there isn't a one of them who would wish for
his own child the misery that awaits Elian if he returns.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing her decision to send Elian back to Cuba, INS
Commissioner Doris Meissner declared, ``Family reunification has
long been a cornerstone of both American immigration law and INS
practice.'' But when the United States reunifies immigrants with
their families, it is always by letting the families come in, never
by forcing the immigrant out! Mercifully, a Florida judge
intervened on Monday, giving emergency custody of Elian to his
great uncle until a hearing can be held on granting him asylum.
</P>
<P>
   If Commissioner Meissner seeks a cornerstone on which to base
Elian's fate, the one she might focus on is this: For 35 years, US
law has offered sanctuary to Cubans who escape Castro's clutches.
We have a well-founded presumption that Cubans have good reason to
flee their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   If Elian's mother had survived the trip to freedom, no one would
have argued that the boy should be sent back. Surely the case for
allowing him to to remain is strengthened, not weakened, by the
price his mother paid to get him here. To borrow a phrase from
another era, Cuba is not healthy for children and other living
things. We cannot save every boy and girl from Castro's nightmare.
But Elian is here now. Let us at least save him.

TECHNOLOGY'S TESTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many people are surprised and frustrated when they buy a new
card for their computer or cellular phone, they take it home, and
the device fails to work.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-three years into the age of solid-state electronics, we
have come to expect nothing less than absolute reliability from the
hardware powering the computer revolution. And it's rare indeed
that this respect is ill-founded: compared to software such as
Microsoft Windows, or even Linux, computer hardware is
astonishingly reliable.
</P>
<P>
   This reliability has been accompanied by ever-plummeting prices.
A decade ago, an Ethernet network card for a desktop personal
computer could cost $350 or more _ and the cards frequently didn't
work.
</P>
<P>
   I remember very clearly a stack of 10-megabit-per- second (Mbps)
cards that I had on my desk in 1990: each card was there because it
had worked in one computer but failed in another.
</P>
<P>
   Today you can buy a 100-Mbps card for $19 and there is little
doubt that when you drop it into your computer, it will work.
</P>
<P>
   This new age of highly reliable hardware is a result of more
stringent controls in the plants where silicon chips are made and
more exact specifications and standards for the completed systems.
But it's also the result of better equipment for testing the
microelectronics before they are assembled into a piece of consumer
electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, more than ever before, test equipment is an essential
part of the modern economy, its manufacturers some of our great
unsung heroes.
</P>
<P>
   One of the leaders in the field of test equipment is Teradyne
Inc. _ yes, the same Teradyne whose headquarters is in that big
white building a few blocks from South Station in Boston. Inside
that building, Teradyne builds the Catalyst tester.
</P>
<P>
   As I walked through the factory, I saw dozens of the machines in
various states of assembly. Each machine is built in its own room,
with the name of the customer and the expected ship date written on
the door.
</P>
<P>
   Costing between $500,000 and $2 million and weighing a little
more than a ton, the Catalyst is designed specifically for testing
electronic devices that combine both analog and diomponents
_ for example, a chip inside an Ethernet card, or on the circuit
board that's attached to a hard disk drive. The Catalyst isn't used
to test microprocessors or memory chips.
</P>
<P>
   Testing a chip takes just a few seconds. Usually a robotic arm
will pick up the chip and place it on top of the circular testing
assembly. The tester then applies power to the chip and injects a
series of test signals. A computer controls the whole process and
monitors how the chip being tested performs.
</P>
<P>
   Besides making a simple good or bad decision, the test might
conclude that the chip is good enough for some applications (or
some customers), but not good enough for others.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the Catalyst special is the wide range of test
signals that it can apply to the device that's being tested.
Depending on how it is configured, the Catalyst can provide more
than 100 volts of power and radio frequency signals across the
entire spectrum to the device being scrutinized. The machine also
can send and receive data to the test device at the rate of up to
400 megabits per second _ considerably faster than even the fastest
Pentium microprocessor.
</P>
<P>
   The whole thing is controlled by a clock that is accurate to
within a few hundred picoseconds (or a ten-billionth of a second).
The key to this flexibility, explained Jeff Schneider, a marketing
manager at the company, is custom-built integrated circuits that
were designed specifically for use in this equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The day I visited Teradyne I saw a Catalyst that was set up to
test chips used in cellular telephones. The machine was testing
four chips at a time. A complete test involved 350 individual
tasks, and took roughly four seconds.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to learn to use a Catalyst, Teradyne offers a
three-week training course. Interestingly enough, the main thrust
of the course is programming and simulation. The programming is
essential, since a different program needs to be custom-designed
for every different device that is to be tested. The simulation
part of the course teaches engineers how to test devices before
they actually exist by simulating both the device and how it will
react to the proposed test. According to Schneider, many of
Teradyne's customers actually find problems with their chip designs
when they test the simulations, before anything is committed to
silicon.
</P>
<P>
   Teradyne started shipping the Catalyst in July 1997; a new
version is expected to ship later this year that will be faster and
more powerful _ just the thing for testing those new high-speed
chips. As sales of these things go, the machine has been quite
successful: more than 300 have shipped, and Teradyne has orders for
at least 400 more. The Internet is the key thing driving sales.
``Over 70 percent of our revenues is coming from Internet-related
issues,'' says Teradyne vice president Thomas B. Newman Jr.
</P>
<P>
   So the next time that you buy a card and plug it into your
computer, sure that it's going to work, think for a moment about
the tremendous amount of technology that went into not only
creating the device, but testing it, so that it would work for you.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CORRECTION  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In last week's column about on-line privacy, I reported that the
World Wide Web Consortium's P3P privacy protocol had a provision
for automatically transferring data such as an Internet user's name
and address to a remote Web site that met the user's privacy
criteria. Lorrie Cranor, the P3P Specification Working Group Chair,
chairwoman, wrote me a note saying that the data transfer
provisions were removed on September 21st.Sept. 21. W3C expects
that some companies may still may implement the data transfer
system as part of an electronic wallet system. Further information
can be found at http://www.w3.org/P3P/data-transfer.html.

&HT;     MANAGEMENT IS GETTING SLY WITH FOX 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TIM GOODMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Rarely has there been a mea culpa as loud and
as large as the one the Fox network unleashed this week.
</P>
<P>
   In front of television critics gathered here, Sandy Grushow, the
new chairman of the Fox Television Entertainment Group, dispensed
with about two seconds of chitchat before falling on the grenade
that was Fox's fall season and, ultimately, its last several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Needless to say, this has been a pretty challenging and
dissatisfying year,'' said Grushow, known in the industry as a man
not given to mixing his message. He said programming, scheduling
and marketing were good places to start placing blame, but not the
real focus of the network's troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is that what Fox experienced since the start of this
broadcast season has been several years in the making. The recipe
is pretty clear. First, we've experienced a natural aging of our
most successful and defining series franchises. Second, we failed
to create enough new franchises to replace those in decline or
retired completely. Finally, for several years, we've over-relied
on the short-term fix of shock reality specials and series.''
</P>
<P>
   What that has led to, Grushow said Tuesday, was a loss of brand
identity. Or, in layman's terms: Viewers don't know what to expect
from Fox these days, outside of animals attacking and bad workers
caught on tape. This particularly annoys Grushow because he was one
of the original founders of Fox, when the network was considered
scrappy, original and daring.
</P>
<P>
   A complete rebuild is needed, Grushow said, and it's going to
take a long time to do it. He credited such shows as ``Malcolm in
the Middle,'' which had the highest debut ratings since ``The
Simpsons'' in 1990, as being one of a few the network hopes will
turn around its fortunes. In addition to turning away from good
pets that have gone bad, Fox seems to be putting new animation on
the back burner and returning to live-action shows such as
``Malcolm.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the recipe Grushow says will redefine Fox. ``That means
resisting that temptation to try and improve our ratings overnight
by saturating our schedule with blood-and-guts reality specials,''
Grushow said. ``Let me be a little more specific on this last
point. While I have no problem with bloopers or magic or even the
occasional wild police videos, I can assure you that the American
public will never see a 747 crash-land in the Mojave Desert on the
Fox network.''
</P>
<P>
   That last stunt was considered at Fox, then rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Grushow left a little breathing room for reality series partly
because Fox has paid for a bunch it has yet to air, so it's a good
bet the network will air them selectively and call it a business
decision despite trying to distance itself from the genre.
</P>
<P>
   If Fox is going to turn around _ and ``Malcolm'' is the
network's best hope so far this season _ Grushow probably is the
guy to do it. He is considered a powerful figure in this town after
a three-year stint at the helm of Twentieth Century Fox Television.
He was brought in over Entertainment President Doug Herzog in
November, and although he had a chance to give Herzog a ringing
endorsement, Grushow took a pass.
</P>
<P>
   At least he is honest. Herzog may yet survive (most Fox
entertainment presidents never last past two years, and Tuesday was
Herzog's one-year anniversary). Why? Because Herzog didn't create
the fall shows but had his hand in ``Malcolm'' and had a glorious
history at MTV and Comedy Central _ networks that have pretty much
stolen Fox's mojo in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Herzog took the hit as well. ``All right. So we
had a bad fall. Not like Sofia Coppola in `The Godfather III' bad,
but like really bad. Bad like one of those movies, you know, where
the train's barreling toward the crossroads and they're cutting
back and forth to the kids in the car, and they're listening to
music and drinking beer and having a great time. You know what?
Frankly, we should have seen it coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Herzog, in addition to taking the disastrous Fox fall and
Grushow's less-than-sterling support with a dose of humor,
announced that the network will try to program year-round in an
effort to rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of networks talk like that, then proceed normally _
fall-season premieres, big movies in November sweeps, a holiday
shutdown, midseason in late January, one more big sweeps stunt in
February and May, and then closing shop for the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Herzog said ``The PJ's'' and ``Family Guy'' will return in late
spring and extend into June, July and August; there will be other
summer programming (including the possibility of new ``Beverly
Hills, 90210'' episodes); and then fresh episodes of returning
series earlier than September. It's certainly a great idea _ making
it happen may be the difference of him being employed or not.
</P>
<P>
   To further distance themselves from schlock, Herzog and Grushow
announced they have signed a far-ranging development deal with
David E. Kelley; produced a 13-episode non-fiction series from R.J.
Cutler, who made ``The War Room'' documentary; and will get two new
comedies from Carsey-Werner productions (``That '70s Show,'' ``3rd
Rock From the Sun,'' etc.), a much-anticipated pilot from James
``Titanic'' Cameron and a new drama series from Michael Crichton
(``Jurassic Park,'' ``ER'').
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Herzog announced that the actor Tom Hanks will
produce an ensemble drama set at West Point, and Fox will get a new
drama series from Marshall Herskovitz and Ed Zwick (``Once and
Again,'' ``thirtysomething,'' etc.). Plus, Darren Star (``Sex and
the City'') will come back to the network that kicked off his
career and do a drama about ``young people in and around Wall
Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Other shows Fox touted included a new series called ``Fearsum,''
from the people behind ``The Blair Witch Project,'' as well as a
live-action version of the cartoon series ``The Tick,'' from Barry
Sonnenfeld (``Men in Black'').
</P>
<P>
   All very impressive. And all very necessary. Those are the kinds
of shows, Grushow said, ``the two of us would like to be up here
talking about instead of all this crap.''
</P>

ANOTHER WAY TO INSULATE THOSE FOLDING ATTIC STAIRS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If it ever gets cold enough this winter, you might notice one
heck of a draft in the hole in the ceiling where the folding attic
stairs are.
</P>
<P>
   That is because the cover of that hole in the ceiling is not
insulated. It forms a sort of trapdoor when the stairs are raised,
and being uninsulated, the result is that draft, and a huge loss of
heat into the cold attic.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of ways to fix this. You can get ready-made
insulation kits that fit right over the opening, or you can make
your own box of insulation to fit.
</P>
<P>
   The handyman has described a do-it-yourself insulation cover a
number of times, but it bears repeating here because many
homeowners have a similar problem.
</P>
<P>
   To make the box, measure the opening and build a slightly larger
box to fit over the opening. Use 1 x 6s for the sides, and nail
1/4-inch hardboard on the bottom. Fill the box with 6 inches of
fiberglass insulation. Cover the top with 1/8-inch hardboard. The
insulation has an R value of 19, good for this purpose. An R value
is the resistance of a material against the passage of heat. The
higher the number, the more the resistance, the better the
insulation.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when you climb the stairs to get to the attic, lift this
box out of the way. Better yet, hinge it to the floor and you can
push it up and away just like a door.
</P>
<P>
   Another way: Use a modified urethane foam board instead of
fiberglass in the box. One inch of this High R Sheathing or Thermax
(two brand names) has an R value of 7; 2 inches is 14, and 3 is 21.
So, make a box of 1 x 4s instead of 1 x 6s; it will be lighter and
easier to manage.
</P>
<P>
   One little thing, however, may interfere with this brilliant
idea. Sometimes the folding stairs in the raised position will
extend above the attic floor.
</P>
<P>
   If that is the case, there is an answer. You can build a berm
around the opening; depending on how far the stairs extend, make it
of 2 x 4s or 2 x 6s, or any other board to allow clearance. Boards
1 1/2 inches thick do best because they are sturdy and provide a
pretty fair insulative value. Then put the insulated box on top of
the berm; it can be hinged, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Two more little things to think about before you rest. It would
be a good idea to put weatherstripping between the box and the
opening, to keep everything nice and right. Use a strip of felt
along the bottom side of the box, or install foam-type,
self-adhesive insulation tape.
</P>
<P>
   All of the above will also work on a small trapdoor in the attic
floor, in case you don't have folding stairs.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BEGGING TO DIFFER &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl McLatchy read about this idea, and thought it was great,
except she figured such a box was pretty heavy, maybe too heavy.
</P>
<P>
   And, she called to tell the handyman what she did, after a few
minutes of thought about wrestling with a heavy door at the top of
the folding stairs.
</P>
<P>
   And this is what she said: ``I made a frame out of PVC tubing. I
don't remember whether it was 1/2 or 3/4 inch, but size doesn't
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used the usual L-shaped corner units and some T units as
well because I wanted an extra piece in the middle of my frame for
rigidity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also made some borders on the frame so it would sit over the
opening and clear the folding stairs in their `up' position. I used
the standard technique to put all these pieces together, using the
solvent to hold them together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yes, I was aware of how this solvent system holds so well
that it cannot be taken apart, so I put everything together dry
first, then did the solvent bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrapped flexible insulation (foil backed by what looks like
bubble wrap) around the frame and the sides, securing it with duct
tape. All I had to do was unroll the insulation and secure it.''
</P>
<P>
   That insulation is a form of reflective insulation, used in a
number of ways. Cheryl's use is a brand new one: light in weight,
fair in insulation value, and well weatherstripped.
</P>
<P>
   Well done, Cheryl McLatchy. We can use more people like you.

<TEXT>
<P>
   George Vanderheiden is like a great ballplayer who hung around a
few seasons too long. He lost a step in the field, his bat got a
little slower, and in his final season he hit .206.
</P>
<P>
   By the end, many fans didn't even realize what a superstar he
once had been.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderheiden hung up his spikes Wednesday after 29 years with
Fidelity Investments. Between 1980 and 1995, Vanderheiden was one
of America's premier money managers. In those years, his Destiny I
fund returned an average of 19 percent a year. Among his peers,
only two managers in the country, Peter Lynch and Kenneth Heebner,
both Bostonians, had better numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But beginning in 1995, Vanderheiden's performance began to slip.
He trailed the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index slightly that year. He
did the same in 1996, 1997, and 1998. In 1999, his fund returned
3.9 percent, compared with 21 percent for the S&AMP;P.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vanderheiden was a victim of the new economy,'' said Jim
Lowell, the editor of Fidelity Investor, a newsletter that tracks
Fidelity funds.
</P>
<P>
   If Lowell is right, then Vanderheiden had plenty of company.
Along with Alan Greenspan, Warren Buffett, and most economists and
money managers, he didn't quite know what to make of an economy
that grew rapidly year after year and a stock market that rose to
levels that didn't seem to make any sense.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1995, he put 15 percent of his fund's money into bonds,
on the expectation that the economy would tank. It didn't, and it
still hasn't. Vanderheiden has whittled down his bond holdings over
the years, but they remain a major drag on performance.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Vanderheiden was light on technology and heavy on
financial stocks, the exact opposite of where he should have been.
He remained loyal to Philip Morris, the troubled cigarette company,
long after most of his colleagues at Fidelity had given up on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was too defensive during a period when the Nasdaq went up
threefold,'' said David O'Leary, president of Alpha Equity
Research, another Fidelity-watcher.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderheiden's approach should not have come as a surprise. In a
1995 interview with Boston Capital, he described his investment
philosophy this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people buy stock and are kind of blinded by the
upside potential. The first question I ask when I buy stock is: How
much can I get hurt by this stock if something goes wrong? And I
figure that in most cases, if you take care of the downside first
and address yourself to that, then the upside takes care of
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Who knew there would be no downside and the upside would turn
out to be almost unlimited?
</P>
<P>
   During a telephone press conference Wednesday, Vanderheiden
stuck to his guns. ``I've had rough spots off and on over 20
years,'' he said. ``This is just another one. If I stayed around
I'm sure I would sail through it.''
</P>
<P>
   He described the valuation of technology stocks as ``inflated''
and predicted that many of today's Internet companies will not be
around five years from now. Asked about the stock market in
general, he said, ``This has been a momentum-driven market, and we
all know momentum-driven markets don't end that well.''
</P>
<P>
   An avid outdoorsman, Vanderheiden, 54, plans to climb mountains
and travel the world with his new free time. He will, however,
retain a role at Fidelity as a board member and as a mentor to
young money managers.
</P>
<P>
   Think Ted Williams coming to spring training to help young
ballplayers.
</P>
<P>
   Williams hit a home run in his final at-bat. Vanderheiden hit
into a double play. But that should not obscure the fact that he
had a terrific career. Over 19 years, Destiny I returned 2,689
percent, compared with 1,777 percent for the S&AMP;P 500 index.
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, if you had invested $10,000 with Vanderheiden
in 1980, it would be worth roughly $270,000 today. Even in the age
of Internet valuations, those are pretty good numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, a reporter approached Russel Kinnel of
Morningstar, the mutual fund rating company, and asked for names of
great money managers who were having a bad year. Kinnel recommended
Vanderheiden. The reporter's response was: Who's that?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny,'' said Kinnel, ``because Vanderheiden is leaving
at a point when no one appreciates what he did. But if you were
starting a hall of fame for mutual funds, Vanderheiden would be one
of your great fund managers.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vanderheiden's Feb. 1 departure will trigger a major game of
musical chairs at Fidelity.:
</P>
<P>
   --Bettina Doulton will succeed Vanderheiden as the manager of
Fidelity Advisor Growth Opportunities Fund and Fidelity VIP III:
Growth Opportunities Portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   --Karen Firestone will succeed Vanderheiden as manager of
Fidelity Destiny I. She will continue to manage Fidelity Large Cap
Stock Fund and Fidelity Advisor Large Cap Stock Fund.
</P>
<P>
   --Stephen Peterson will run Fidelity Puritan Fund, succeeding
Doulton. Petersen will continue to manage Fidelity Equity-Income
Fund and VIP: Equity-Income Portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   --Stephen Dufour will run Fidelity Equity-Income II Fund,
succeeding Doulton.
</P>
<P>
   --Robert Ewing will run Fidelity Balanced Fund, succeeding
Dufour.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity also named new managers for some of its select funds.

PARENTING VIA THE WEB, CREDIBILITY IS THE CONCERN 
</HEADLINE>
 -BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With dozens of press releases, electronic or otherwise, crossing
my desk to trumpet the wonders of yet another Web site for parents,
one thing is clear: No matter what parenting issue we face,
information is only a fingertip away. As comforting as that thought
may be, however, actually wending one's way through what's
available for parents on the World Wide Web takes more patience
than parenting a 2-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   As a novice user, I began my efforts to make sense of it all
intelligently enough, I thought, with a search engine (Yahoo!) and
a subject a reader had recently e-mailed me about: thumb-sucking.
</P>
<P>
   Aha! Four possibilities. Good start.
</P>
<P>
   The first was for adults who still suck their thumbs. Uh-uh. The
second, ``My thumb and I,'' looked hopeful but offered only a link
to purchase a book. The third and fourth options were eye-openers:
Triggered by the second two syllables of my query, the search
engine was suggesting porn sites. (Did I say I was a novice?!) As
much as that took me by surprise, it was a stark reminder that
searchengines are not a safe tool for our children.
</P>
<P>
   OK, try again. New search engine (Alta Vista), new subject:
bed-wetting.
</P>
<P>
   This gave me 10 choices: three direct links to products; one
server that could not be found; three parent chat rooms; one
definition of enuresis; one page on enuresis in children with spina
bifida; and one ``free'' consultation with a doctor that turned out
to cost $475.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson learned: Forget the search engine.
</P>
<P>
   With many hundreds of Web sites for parents and new ones
appearing on the screen almost daily, the biggest issue clearly is
not information _ it's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry about parents out there on the Web,'' says Dianne
Rothenberg, associate director of ERIC Clearinghouse on Elementary
and Early Childhood Education at the University of Illinois. She
has reviewed more than 200 sites for parents and says there are
typically two problems with using search engines: They often lead
to commercial sites, and there is no evaluation of the links, which
is why searching for something like thumb-sucking can lead to
pornography. (A third problem, which she didn't mention but which
surfaced when I tried to retrace my steps, is that search engines
do not necessarily turn up the same links the second time through.)
</P>
<P>
   Rothenberg's concern about commercial sites is that they tend to
have a bias that may or may not be obvious or stated.
</P>
<P>
   ``A parent's first question needs to be: What is (a site's)
purpose in giving advice?'' she says. ``If they are selling a book
or product . . . typically, a commercial site presents only one
side of an issue and doesn't provide you with a range of opinion or
expertise.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Blagojevic, an early-childhood Internet guru and
curriculum coordinator at the Sharing Place Child Care Center in
Orono, Maine, says a good rule of thumb for any parenting site is
``Look at the reputation of the group offering the information.''
</P>
<P>
   A reputable site, she says, immediately spells out its goal or
purpose and identifies the author or sponsoring organization. That
goes a long way toward helping you judge the content, Rothenberg
points out: ``If there's a bias, a reputable site will tell you so
right away.'' For instance, www.pampers.com is decidedly a
commercial site, but its Pampers Parenting Institute offers advice
from clearly identified, reputable authorities, including
pediatrician and author T. Berry Brazelton.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other Web site pitfalls:
</P>
<P>
   --Question-and-answer format. This is a popular device on Web
sites for parents, but Rothenberg urges caution. ``View it as input
into understanding a problem, not as an answer,'' she says. ``I'd
be leery of any place on the Web that tells you, `This is what you
should do.' '' She says the best parenting sites offer information
and research, not advice.
</P>
<P>
   --Experts. Many Web sites offer ``expert'' resources but don't
identify the expert, identify him or her without affiliation, or
spread the person too thin, so that he or she is answering
questions without the proper background. ``Don't assume credibility
just because someone is identified as an `expert,' '' says
Blagojevic.
</P>
<P>
   --Chat rooms. Similarly, many parents fall into the trap of
accepting information as gospel just because it's on line, says
Rothenberg. Not everyone in a parent chat room is necessarily a
parent, however, and the person's perspective may have no relevance
to your situation: Perhaps the writer has a 3-year-old and is
giving advice about your 7-year-old. ``I always tell parents to
ask, `How old are your children?' '' says Rothenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of chat rooms, Blagojevic recommends ListServ discussion
groups, which are like chat rooms except that they are not
instantaneous. She is co-ListServ owner of Early Childhood
Education On Line, which you can subscribe to at no charge by
sending e-mail to LISTSERV(at)Maine.Edu and typing subscribe
ECEOL-L and your name in the message field.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With these cautions in mind, there are some excellent Web sites
for parents. Here are some worth bookmarking:
</P>
<P>
   --NPIN.org This site of the National Parent Information Network,
sponsored by ERIC and funded by the US Department of Education, is
the world's largest database on education and offers links to an
exhaustive list of Web sites. It is probably the best single site
out there, and a good choice for your search engine (click on
Searching NPIN) for any education and/or parenting topic.
Highlights: ``Parent ListServe'' and ``AskEric.'' The former is an
on-line discussion group (click on questions) where you submit
questions and comments and receive responses. You need to subscribe
to get on the list, but there is no fee. You can also submit
questions to AskERIC by e-mailing askERIC(at)ericir.syr.edu or you
can go directly to the AskERIC Web site at www.askERIC.org/.
Questions are forwarded to an appropriate professional within the
ERIC network. Signed answers, which typically include relevant Web
sites, resources, and related reading, are returned within two
days. AskERIC receives 50,000 questions a year.
</P>
<P>
   --zerotothree.org A national nonprofit for parents of children
ranging from infancy to age 3, this site provides a wealth of
material on infant and toddler development. Highlights: A
``Parent's Guide to Developmental Assessment'' and ``Choosing
Quality Child Care,'' especially ``Questions to Ask.''
</P>
<P>
   --http://www.ume.maine.edu/cofed Early Childhood Education on
Line at the University of Maine offers quality links on a range of
educational and developmental issues for parents of young children.
Highlight: At the bottom of the Welcome page, click on ``Research
and Resources,'' then on ``Early Childhood Education On-Line''; go
to the blue boxes and click on ``ECE and the Net,'' ``Children and
Developmental Guidelines,'' or ``Professional Development.'' Don't
be put off by the titles; although some of this is in academese,
there's plenty here for parents. This is also where Bic's
ListServ lives.
</P>
<P>
   --http://ldonline.org LDOnline is sponsored by the Learning
Project of WETA-TV and radio of Washington, D.C., and the
Coordinated Campaign for Learning Disabilities. It offers a
positive perspective for parents on living and coping with
children's learning disabilities. Highlights: Periodic on-line
chats with respected LD experts; comprehensive state-by-state
listing of conferences on learning disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   --www.parentsoup.com This is a commercial site with lots of ads
(part of IVillage.com), but it also has many helpful aspects.
Highlights: Chats available daily according to the age of your
child. Also, click on ``Resources,'' then on ``Parenting
Organizations'' and you'll find a definitive listing of every
conceivable organization you ever wanted to know about.
</P>
<P>
   --www.nncc.org National Network for Child Care, funded by the US
Department of Agriculture, offers more than 1,000 professionally
reviewed, research-based publications on child-care issues.
Highlights: KIDCARE, an e-mail ListServ, and Person-to-Person, both
specializing in child-care issues.
</P>
<P>
   --naeyc.org The National Association for the Education of Young
Children, the nation's most respected accrediting organization for
day care and preschool. Highlight: The ``For Parents'' section is
under development so there's not much here yet, but you get a list
of accredited centers in your area.
</P>
<P>
   --www.nmsa.org The National Middle School Association offers a
wide range of research material for parents of 10- to 14-year-olds,
from developmental issues like dating to controversial subjects
such as whether Grade 5 should be included in the middle school.
Click on ``Resource Center'' to see the range of topics. (Material
in this site is high quality but sometimes not very readable.)
</P>
<P>
   --http://education.indiana.edu/cas Center for Adolescent Studies
at Indiania University. Highlight: Click on ``Sites for Parents,''
then on ``Parenting Adolescents'' and ``Archives,'' and you'll find
any teen topic from appearance to unacceptable peer behavior. Also
worth looking at: Click on ``Normal Adolescence,'' then on
``Developmental Tasks of Adolescence.''
</P>
<P>
   --www.familyeducation.com Family Education Network, an
interactive educational site for parents and teachers, K through
12. It has lots of ads and is a complicated site to wend through,
but it offers lots of educational materials.
</P>
<P>
   --www.kidsource.com KidSource, also a commercial site, but less
overwhelming than some. It collects and repackages materials from
other reliable sources. Highlight: New product news and recalls.
</P>
<P>
   --www.aap.org The American Academy of Pediatrics, the definitive
site for everything health-related, from diaper rash to car seats.
Highlight: Use the search at left to find topics of interest.
</P>
<P>
   So what about thumb-sucking? The good news is that at all these
sites, ``sucking'' is not a dirty word. Unfortunately, none of the
sites I researched had as much information as I wished for. At
www.aap.org, there's a reprint from a book about the developmental
need for sucking but not much about how to cope; parentsoup.com
turned up nine related thumb-sucking questions from other parents,
which is helpful. But the answers were from a variety of experts
whose credentials were not always clearly identified.
</P>
<P>
   So here was another lesson learned: You can spend a lot of time
trying to get information on the Web, when one good book from the
library (or a search of Boston.com for past Child Caring columns;
may I recommend the one on thumbsucking?) would do the trick very
nicely.

BEDROOMS HAVE DUCTS, BUT NO HEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have two-zone hot-air heat by gas. Upstairs there are two
identical duct runs of 20 feet leading to bedrooms, and a third to
a bathroom. I can feel heat coming out of the register in the
bathroom, but not in the bedrooms, and they are cold. What's wrong,
and how can I fix it?
</P>
<P>
   MARK CHAPMAN, Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. A two-zone system with hot air heat is tricky, and I just
wonder if the installers neglected to include those two 20-foot
ducts in either zone. If the house is new, and you have been in it
less than a year, the onus is on the installers and they should
make the correction. Those 20-foot runs seem rather long, but a
forced hot-air system of adequate size shoud handle it without
breathing hard.
</P>
<P>
   Also, check to make sure there are cold-air returns in one or
both rooms; a hot-air system must have a cold-air return to allow
the warm air that heats the rooms to return to the furnace after it
has cooled. If there are no cold-air returns, the furnace can pump
all the hot air in the world, but not much of it would get into
those rooms, because it would be pumping into a dead end, an
enclosed area.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it might be a simple matter of a damper in the wrong
position. Small, round, hot air ducts leading from the furnace or
trunk-line plenum (a large square or rectangular duct, most often
in the basement) usually have a damper where they leave the plenum.
The damper looks like a little metal handle that is either parallel
to the duct (open) or at right angles to it (closed). The dampers
are used to balance the heating system, providing more hot air to
go to rooms that need it and less to rooms that do not. Check the
ducts leading to the two rooms involved; if the dampers are closed,
open them and see what happens.

   Linda Carp asked why her one-handle shower valve rumbles and
rattles when she turns it on. The handyman suggested it might be
due to a faulty or dirty valve, adding that cleaning it might work,
or that it might have to be replaced.

   Wrong, said William Tragakis, who heads Watertown Plumbing &AMP;
Heating Supply. Tragakis said the rumbling, which can get pretty
scary, is caused by a loose washer, or two loose washers, and that
replacing them, or having a plumber do so, will fix the problem.
So, thanks Bill; the handyman appreciates the tip.

<P>
   Q. When I turn up the heat and my gas boiler goes on, water
comes out from the drainpipe that I think is the safety relief
valve. I get about a gallon overnight. How can I fix it?
</P>
<P>
   LOAN VO, Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Pressure relief valves (they are on top of the boiler with a
pipe leading down the side to the floor) are designed to keep the
water pressure in the boiler from getting so high that it blows the
boiler apart. They are very sensitive to pressure, and sometimes
leak water for no good reason. Sometimes they get out of adjustment
when they are tested. The cure is to replace the pressure relief
valve. A plumber could do this, or have ServicEdge do it, by
calling 888-942-3343. ServicEdge, a company separate from the gas
company, services boilers, furnaces, burners, and other gas-fired
appliances.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Since I moved to a new town, I've found that my laundry
doesn't smell of detergent anymore. I liked the fresh scent of
detergent. What happened? How can I get that fresh smell back?
</P>
<P>
   M.G., Dracut, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It's only a guess, but I think it's because of the water. If
the water in Arlington is softer than in Dracut, your washing
machine did not take all the detergent out during its rinse cycle,
and you were smelling the residue. But, the harder water in Dracut
holds less detergent, and detergent is more easily removed from
hard water. It's only a guess. Perhaps you could use a
stronger-smelling detergent to get back that fresh aroma.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have single-glazed double-hung windows with aluminum storms
and screens. The main windows have true divided lights, with no
grids. One window does not go all the way down. I push it down and
it pops right up again. How can I get it to go down and stay down?
</P>
<P>
   GREG BOCKWEG, Marlborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. If your windows are weight balanced (with ropes, pulleys, and
weights), it may be that the cord holding the weight is too short,
and when the window is lowered, the weight rises and hits the
pulley before the window hits the sill. It could happen with the
weights on both sides of the window. To check this, lower the
window and lock it, if possible. Then pull the cord; if there is no
slack in the cord, it is, indeed, too short, and needs to be
replaced with a longer one.
</P>
<P>
   If your windows are not weighted, something might be in the jamb
where the window goes up and down, thus blocking its movement. It
could be a bent piece of metal weatherstripping or a nail sticking
out. It does not seem like a broken spring; when springs fail, the
windows usually go down and stay down. Finally, there might be
something on the sill that is preventing complete closure.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My house has some nice hardwood floors, but they are 12 years
old and in need of some refurbishing, although not necessarily
resanding and refinishing. I'd like to put on one new coat of
varnish. How can I tell whether the old varnish is water- or
oil-based?
</P>
<P>
   JOHN BALUNAS, Northborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Ordinarily, you would have to have a paint chip analyzed by a
lab, but that is not necessary here. Being 12 years old, the
varnish is probably oil. And, to refurbish, sand the floors with
medium-fine sandpaper by hand or machine (but not necessarily a
floor machine) to roughen the finish and reduce gloss. Then wash
with paint thinner or a strong solution of Spic and Span and water.
No need to rinse. Then apply one coat of an oil-based polyurethane
varnish. Two will be better. Be sure to apply thin coats, with a
brush. The sanding is essential for proper adhesion of the new
coats.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Raccoons are raiding my in-ground garbage can and having a
wonderful time at my expense. They seem to share the work in
opening the can. How can I deter them?
</P>
<P>
   M.G., Needham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. There are various animal repellents you can spray on and
around the can, but they are effective only temporarily, if at all.
First, try sprinkling cayenne pepper flakes on the garbage and on
the can. Or, better yet, cayenne powder, but be careful with that
powder because it can cause allergic reactions if inhaled.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you may have to build a heavy-duty steel cage around
the can to keep the varmints out. But you know they can open almost
anything, so the cage must be super-strong.
</P>

ON-LINE WORLD IS ALWAYS IN BLOOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL STOCKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most of the year you won't find many busy gardeners sitting
glued to computer screens. After all, gardening is sensual and
tactile. It's about escaping confinement, wrestling with weeds, and
enjoying sunlight and fresh air alongside the plants in your veggie
patch and flower bower.
</P>
<P>
   But winter's different. It's the time when the gardener's world
is defined by anticipation, frustration, and four walls. It's the
season of the Web.
</P>
<P>
   For housebound people with time, rather than dirt, on their
hands, Web sites can offer answers to gardening questions, notice
of upcoming lectures, invitations to garden-oriented vacations, the
opportunity to trade opinions with other gardeners who share a
passion for a specific kind of plant, or a chance to electronically
visit gardens far from home. Though the world outside may be
barren, the virtual world is always in bloom.
</P>
<P>
   The World Wide Web also offers unlimited shopping opportunities
and may eventually replace catalogs as the main way to place
midwinter orders for seeds, plants, garden art, and supplies.
</P>
<P>
   But at this still-early stage, part of the charm of gardening
Web sites is that so many are predominantly noncommercial. After
all, the Web was established by university researchers to help them
trade knowledge for its own sake, and that's exactly what gardeners
like to do. Many of the most informative sites remain those posted
by land-grant colleges with strong agricultural programs.
</P>
<P>
   Surfing the gardening Web is easy using so-called search engines
like Alta Vista and Yahoo! Just type in a few descriptive words,
and these programs will whisk you to related Web sites, even if you
don't have their names or addresses. Be as specific as possible.
For instance, type ``Ohio State horticulture,'' and you'll get onto
the great Web site at www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/hcs/hcs.html. Type
``gardening'' and you'll be swamped by options, many of them not
worth pursuing.
</P>
<P>
   Finding just one good Web site can open the door to many more. A
lot of Web sites offer links to other good sites devoted to the
same topic that you can jump to with a double click. After a few
hours of this, you'll stop thinking in terms of individual Web
sites and start picturing gardening on line as a huge,
interconnected subculture.
</P>
<P>
   If surfing this network is almost effortless, locating specific
information can be difficult and time-consuming. Most gardeners
find it much quicker to turn to their well-worn reference books for
answers to questions. But the more you use the Web, the faster and
more efficient you'll get at zeroing in on what you really want to
know instead of just wandering dazed through the giant shopping
mall of virtual gardening. One timesaver is ``bookmarking,'' making
your own permanent links between your ``home page,'' the place you
start out, and gardening Web sites you find repeatedly helpful.
Just click on ``bookmark'' while the Web site you want is on your
screen, and soon you'll build a directory of these favorites
without having to type a single address.
</P>
<P>
   Constant updating is one big advantage the Web has over books
and catalogs. You have a better chance on the Web of finding
information on pests that reflects the latest research. For
instance, you can learn the latest about Integrated Pest
Management, including University of Rhode Island entomologist Dick
Casagrande's project to release parasitic wasps that kill the lily
leaf beetle, by going to www.nysaes.cornell.edu/ipmnet/ri. And this
address will link you to IPM Web sites in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Local Web sites offer information on upcoming garden events, and
are geared to gardening in our climate.
</P>
<P>
   Hilda Morrill, former public relations chairwoman of the Garden
Club Federation of Massachusetts and past president of the Amateur
Gardeners of Milton, has developed www.bostongardens.com, which
invites free postings of garden club events open to the public.
Visitors to the site will also find gardening tips, articles, book
reviews, and links to other Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Other local sites include the Arnold Arboretum at
www.arboretum.harvard.edu and its Institute for Cultural Landscape
Studies at www.icls.harvard.edu. Then there's the Massachusetts
Horticultural Society at www.masshort.org and the New England
Garden History Society at www.masshort.org/neghs.htm, the New
England Wild Flower Society at www.newfs.org/ and the Worcester
County Horticulture Society at towerhillbg.org/index.html.
</P>
<P>
   You can visit the beautiful gardens and greenhouses of Smith
College at www.smith.edu/garden/, which has won design awards.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the best horticultural Web sites are:
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn Botanical Garden at www.bbg.org, which contains a
clever virtual garden tour of its premises with a directory called
the ``Stroll Control.'' Botanical gardens and colleges are good
places to sign up for botanical tours, either to local gardens or
far-flung destinations like Japan or New Zealand. This site offers
some of the best travel programs for the well-heeled enthusiast.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State University's ``Plants of Horticulture'' database at
www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/hort/plants.html has nearly 4,000
descriptions and images.
</P>
<P>
   The Pennsylvania Horticultural Society Web site at
www.libertynet.org/phs contains profiles of recommended Gold Medal
Plants and sources for buying them. Each plant has been selected
for ease of growth, disease resistance, and beauty by panels
including gardeners and landscapers.
</P>
<P>
   The Smithsonian Institution Research Information System at
www.siris.si.edu has a great collection of photographs of private
and public gardens throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Strybing Botanical Garden in San Francisco at
www.strybing.org is a beautiful site for sore eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Botanical Garden in England has a site at
www.rbgkew.org.uk that allows you to visit abroad without leaving
your chair.
</P>
<P>
   The Rutgers Cooperative Extension at
rce.rutgers.edu/weeddocuments will help you identify weeds, and
much else.
</P>
<P>
   You can also get gardening articles that appeared in print from
some Web sites. Present and past garden columns from the At Home
section are available through www.boston.com.
</P>
<P>
   You can find articles from Boston-based Horticulture magazine at
www.horticulturemagazine.com. Or you can read stories from Organic
Gardening at organicgardening.com or Fine Gardening at
finegardening.com without paying for a subscription.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All of these sites will try to sell you something. But if you're
interested in shopping over the Net, garden.com is by far the
largest commercial gardening site, though those who have ordered
through it give it mixed reviews on plant quality. Even if you're
not buying anything, this site is a good source for information and
links to other sites. It, too, has an on-line magazine, called
Garden Escape.
</P>
<P>
   Another large commercial site is the Virtual Garden at
www.vg.com, which features the on-line version of the ``Time Life
Complete Gardener Encyclopedia,'' as well as regional gardening
advice, chat rooms, a column by noted writer Alan Lacy, and someone
to answer gardening questions.
</P>
<P>
   Many nurseries and seed companies also have Web sites, which are
updated according to plant availability. Checking them out is a
great way of eliminating the disappointment all gardeners have felt
when a box of long-awaited plants arrives full of substitutions for
the sold-out plants they really wanted. Even if you order by mail
or fax, nursery Web sites can be great for researching the
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   The W. Atlee Burpee Co. at www.burpee.com has a particularly
lively Web site, including a virtual tour of its test gardens and a
link to a horticulturalist at the National Gardening Association in
Burlington, Vt., who answers questions.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can got straight to the NGA Web site at
www2.garden.org/nga, which is one of the best. Can you expect less
from a nonprofit organization based in a city were IBM is a major
employer? In addition to answering questions, NGA has a great
system for linking you to other Web sites. It also offers on-line
courses (these cost money) and the contents of its National
Gardening Association magazine (free).
</P>
<P>
   The search engines and links can help you find specialty
nurseries if you want a larger selection of, for instance, lilacs
or hydrangeas to choose from than a general nursery can offer. And
the Web gives them more space to describe (and hopefully picture)
each plant.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You can also use the Web to get in touch with other gardeners or
to receive specialized e-mail. One way to do this is to subscribe
to an e-mail ``list'' shared by gardeners who have similar
interests, be it aroids or trilliums. One Web site for finding such
lists is www.liszt.com/select/Nature/Plants. When you subscribe,
the list owner will provide you with all the necessary information.
</P>
<P>
   You can also post questions at Web site forums, where readers
will leave you answers. One of the biggests links for this is
www.gardenweb.com.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of sites ask you to register your address, which means
you'll receive unsolicited e-mail, or ``spam,'' from them. But you
don't have to sign in unless you choose to.
</P>
<P>
   The Web isn't for everybody all the time, but it can be a great
way to get through winter. And by the time you've mastered the
virtual garden world, it may be warm enough to go outside and do
some real 3-D gardening.

A HOST OF HOUSEWARES A CLICK AWAY 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Choosing furniture is such a touchy-feely process. Who would buy
a sofa without sitting on it? A mattress without stretching out on
it? A comfy chair without curling up in it?
</P>
<P>
   Well, if the predictions of industry analysts materialize, the
answer is _ a lot of folks. At the moment, buying furniture off the
Net is still in its infancy. But 1999 will go down as the year of
the start-up e-furnishing store. Just a few of the recently born
sites hoping for a piece of the cyberspace pie are living.com,
retromodern.com, furnitureonline.com, behome.com,
decoratewithstyle.com, and two locally based sites, furniture.com
and homeportfolio.com.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these sites are backed by millions in venture capital.
But all have dreams of rising above the herd and becoming the next
amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   There are certainly no guarantees out there in cyberspace, but
that doesn't seem to matter. A lot of people with a few extra bucks
just don't want to be left behind. They're gambling that the
brick-and-mortar stores of today will go the way of the dinosaur
and that on-line furniture and home-furnishings shopping will be
the future.
</P>
<P>
   And it may be worth the gamble. After all, home furnishings is a
$178 billion-a-year industry; on-line projected sales for 1999
topped $319 million and could hit $3.5 billion by 2003, according
to Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the greatest hurdle for e-commerce furniture
hopefuls is that it's a very test-the-sofa and fluff-the-pillows
market. Therefore, the majority of people using the sites today are
logging on for information and comparison pricing. Pressed for time
and unwilling to spend weekends shlepping from showroom to
showroom, they surf the Net and then head to local stores, armed
with price and product information.
</P>
<P>
   Size is another problem. According to Forrester analyst Seema
Williams, 75 percent of home products sold through catalogs are
UPS-shippable _ in other words, relatively small items such as
lamps, tables, miniblinds. This will most likely be mirrored on the
Internet. People will buy small products before they'll purchase a
sofa or armoire. But in the future? Sure, we'll be buying large
purchases on line, says Williams.
</P>
<P>
   And because the Internet is so new and so vast and the
possibilities so limitless, it's merely a matter of time before
further technological innovations and advancements make on-line
shopping increasingly consumer-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   In the Boston area, there are two sites that demand attention.
One is furniture.com, based in Framingham; the other is
homeportfolio.com, with offices in a renovated church in Newton.
Both were begun by novice entrepreneurs but are now backed by
deep-pocket financing and run by seasoned CEOs from the corporate
world.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Furniture.com
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Furniture.com was the brainchild of Steve Rothschild, whose
family owned the Empire furniture store in Worcester, Mass., and
Misha Katz, a technological guru who built the outfit's original
Web site and is now vice president of new technology. The duo
created their site, originally called furnituresite.com, in July
1997. In January 1999, the name was changed to furniture.com, and
financing to date tops $48 million. The site offers more than
50,000 items. Most analysts agree that furniture.com is a strong
leader in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``In September, we had 772,000 unique visitors come to the
site,'' meaning new visitors, not repeat customers, says Andrew
Brooks, CEO of furniture.com. ``And they spent an average of nine
minutes on site, which indicates to us that they're finding the
experience evolving and user-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   ``And no, shoppers are not just buying small items,'' Brooks
adds, ``but will very often buy a multithousand-dollar item as
their first purchase.''
</P>
<P>
   He credits some of their success to three consumer services.
</P>
<P>
   --``Furniture Finder.'' This search tool is for consumers who
want to redo a room but don't know exactly what they want. If the
room to be decorated is a bedroom, they can click ``bedroom'' and
find a vast array of beds, bureaus, and so forth, in various
styles, finishes, and prices, with other helpful information such
as dimensions, care, warranties, and delivery.
</P>
<P>
   --``Style Guide.'' This further helps the consumer by
identifying and dividing all available items into four main
categories: casual contemporary, country, modern, and traditional.
</P>
<P>
   --``Room Planner.'' This allows users to create a plan of their
home bedroom on the screen with the proper dimensions and placement
of doors and windows _ like an architectural drawing. They can then
place the furniture they already own in the room with the proper
dimensions, then introduce new pieces into the space. This helps
consumers to visualize how the room will look with both old and new
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Furniture.com represents more than 150 manufacturers of medium-
to higher-price contemporary furniturs are shipped directly
from manufacturer to consumer, thereby cutting out the middleman,
or retailer. Also, 50 percent of this site's offerings are private
labels _ items made especially for furniture.com.
</P>
<P>
   Another asset is the live-human-being element: design
consultants or personal shoppers who will answer consumer questions
on a pop-up window on the computer screen or by telephone. In
addition, fabric swatches are available _ not many; one to eight
per item _ and are delivered within four days. Delivery of ordered
furniture is free, along with setup. There is no charge for
returns, but you won't get your money back, only credit toward your
next purchase. There's also an on-line magazine with ``unbiased''
product information, a ``QuickShip Boutique'' with 13 items
available for delivery within three weeks, and instant on-line
financing with credit approval, according to CEO Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Furniture is not a commodity,'' says Kirsten von Hassel, vice
president of marketing. ``It is style-driven and ego- driven.
People are nest-building and want to make a public statement in
their homes of their individual style and tastes. We want to help
consumers realize what they are trying to achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   Heather Crain recently bought a bedroom set from furniture.com.
After looking in various local stores and not finding what she
wanted, she began searching the Net. She found furniture.com the
easiest and most informative site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd bought books and CDs before off the Net, but never a large
purchase,'' says Crain, a national category manager for Gillette.
``But I really didn't have a problem with such a large order. I
figured if the merchandise was terrible, they'd have to take it
back or they'd have a serious lawsuit on their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the set was delivered on time and was exactly what she
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks great,'' says Crain, ``and I'd buy something again
from them, absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Homeportfolio.com
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Homeportfolio.com has recently evolved from an Internet guide to
top-of-the-line and hard-to-find home design products to an
emerging e-commerce site. In other words, the site was originally
more educator than retailer, offering the consumer and design
professional products chosen by the site's editorial team for their
workmanship, design, and materials. Unlike furniture.com, this is
not just a furniture site but features bath fixtures, appliances,
windows and doors, and flooring, along with the products of 500
furniture manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Homeportfolio entered the e-commerce fray the week after
Thanksgiving. Merchandise is limited to 22 brands and 2,000
products. Some analysts feel this site may have an uphill battle
competing with the more seasoned, everything-already-in-place
e-commerce players.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the site was born in 1994 when two former Yale
classmates met for lunch. Rolly Rouse, an architect and engineer,
wanted to help people create the house of their dreams by providing
them with on-line information to achieve their goals. He shared his
thoughts with his friend Tom Ashbrook, a journalist who was then
working for The Boston Globe. They got their first seed money in
1996 and hired Shawn Becker from the MIT Media Lab to help design a
site.
</P>
<P>
   Homeportfolio was launched under the umbrella of BuildingBlocks
Interactive in January 1998. It recently completed a second round
of financing totaling $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to reorganize the entire home-design industry around
the consumer,'' says Rouse. ``We wanted a site that would link the
consumer with manufacturers, retailers, and design professionals.
We wanted to help people get homes that matched their
aspirations.''
</P>
<P>
   At present, they are showing 750 top brands from around the
world. Consumers can build on-line portfolios of wish-list products
and also keep a tally of where these products are sold in their
local area _ ``Dealer Locator'' lists top 25,000 retailers. Another
addition is the ``Interior Designer Portfolio,'' which includes
short biographies of designers, a statement of their vision and
approach, and several images of their work.
</P>
<P>
   A warning posted for visitors to the site during the holidays
stating that they might ``experience periodic slow performance''
has been removed since Homeportfolio switched to a more robust
server, according to company spokesperson Jennifer Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The site is running a lot faster now,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Maguire of Louisville, Ky., who is in the process of
putting an addition on his house and renovating a kitchen, has used
Homeportfolio as a launching point for ideas on different products
and on cabinetry and lighting. When it became an e-commerce site,
he purchased two dozen pulls for his kitchen cabinets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our kitchen is a very organic space and I wanted complementary
cabinet pulls,'' say Maguire, an architect, who does a lot of
purchasing off the Internet. ``I found a collection of pulls, the
Arizona Knob collection, made by a company named Providence, that
are made from rocks, and ordered two dozen on Dec. 10. I didn't
expect to receive them until after the holidays. Well, I got them
in a week.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal says the best feature of this site is
its ``personal portfolio.'' A negative is ``the site isn't easy to
navigate and it is hard to comparison-shop; too often, . . . prices
are `withheld at the manufacturer's request.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Other sites
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another site is hometownstores.com, which grew out of the
family-owned Curry Ace Hardware stores in Quincy and Braintree,
Mass. Sean Curry and Mark Vassalli came up with and designed the
site, supported by Curry's father, Bob. Launched in July, this site
offers more than 50,000 brand-name hardware and home-goods
products. In the future, the site hopes to include other stores,
making it similar to shopping in a small New England mall.
</P>
<P>
   Other sites worth visiting:
</P>
<P>
   --behome.com: Limited furniture selection _ eight manufacturers
_ but detailed descriptions of finish, construction, style,
dimensions, price, and warranty of mid-to-high-price pieces on a
very usable site.
</P>

TOOLS, WORK LOAD KEY IN COPING WITH RSI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE HATCH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the RSI that's the worst of it. Gardening brings aches and
pains, especially to the suburban gardener after a long winter's
layoff. But, oh, that RSI.
</P>
<P>
   Every spring I hurt. A not-so-cold weekend is spent spraying
dormant oil and maybe fungicides and pruning the apple tree, which
is getting closer to the open, low shape I want for it.
</P>
<P>
   I turn over beds in the vegetable garden, lop the buddleias low,
trim dead foliage all over the place (taking care not to disturb
the swelling buds of the peonies).
</P>
<P>
   And I hurt. My back aches, my shoulders throb, my legs turn to
iron. For all of that, there's ibuprofen and hot showers or baths.
Take a day or two off, and it's all back to normal.
</P>
<P>
   Not so with repetitive strain injuries. My wrists and hands and
forearms ache, and they don't seek warmth, because they are
inflamed. They want cold. And while the pain subsides after a few
days off, the injuries don't completely heal. They are easily
aggravated.
</P>
<P>
   Repetitive strain injuries pretty much involve awkwardness,
force, vibration, and, above all, repetition, according to Dr.
David Diamond of the medical department at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Computer operators, office workers, and researchers endure such
work conditions. Diamond, an RSI expert, treats them all at MIT.
Gardeners experience those conditions, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mixed in with all the computer users here . . . I have seen a
handful of RSI sufferers whose symptoms were aggravated by
gardening tasks,'' Diamond told me in a recent phone conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where I've seen it is people planting 300 bulbs with a trowel
that doesn't quite fit their hand comfortably and doing a lot of
pruning with pruning shears,'' Diamond said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it with a woman who was cutting twigs to make floral
arrangements and repetitively using dull shears, and so applying a
lot of force.''
</P>
<P>
   In the office environment, Diamond said, RSI sufferers need to
look at how they do the job, how they position themselves. It's the
same in the garden. Get a kneeling pad instead of leaning over or
climb a ladder instead of reaching too high.
</P>
<P>
   The next thing to look at is the tools. They need to be sharp to
reduce the force needed to make them work, Diamond said. If they
have a spring component, it should be at the proper tension so you
don't have to grip excessively hard.
</P>
<P>
   Use tools with softer, fatter, more curved handles, which allow
more neutral hand positions, Diamond said. Garden hoses with a
pistol grip are better than the old-fashioned turn-nozzles.
</P>
<P>
   And beware of so-called ergonomic tools. Not all are truly
ergonomic, so you have to do some shopping. You get what you pay
for.
</P>
<P>
   Gardeners can address the issue of repetition by how they
structure their work, Diamond said. Mix up the tasks. If you have
five hours of pruning, do some, then something else; then do some
more, then something else.
</P>
<P>
   My first encounter with gardening RSI was in a class at the
Arnold Arboretum in Boston about 10 years ago. A nice woman who did
almost nothing but garden showed up one day with her hand in a
splint. Pruning, squeezing those handles over and over, did her in.
She was worried.
</P>
<P>
   I became worried when my RSI at the newspaper started coming
home with me at night. Cold compresses helped, but I found it took
all weekend to be rid of the pain. All weekend without gardening.
</P>
<P>
   So I did something. I saw a doctor, I attended classes, I got
involved with my union's RSI effort.
</P>
<P>
   I have used a splint to keep my left wrist from flexing in my
sleep, I have learned to hold my hands and arms naturally and how
to type to minimize injury, and I have set up my work station
ergonomically. I have good tools, I use them right.
</P>
<P>
   It has helped a lot, but it cannot eliminate the RSI. The
gardening makes it worse, but I am not going to give that up. You
shouldn't either. Get help, educate yourself, don't ignore RSI.
</P>
<P>
   If all I did was a little gardening, I'd be fine, so I look
forward to retirement. Of course, then I'll be doing just that much
more gardening.
</P>

CONVERTIBLES AND THEIR SIREN CALL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a day when winter blinked.
</P>
<P>
   Three days into the New Year, air warm and sun glistening, she
passed me on the interstate. The top on her Saab convertible was
down and she had a scarf on her head, sunglasses wrapped across her
eyes, as she bopped to music I could not hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thelma or Louise?,'' I asked myself.
</P>
<P>
   And that got me to thinking about convertibles.
</P>
<P>
   Remembering how they had symbolized different things down the
years: panache, elegance, escape, the freedom of the open road.
</P>
<P>
   They'd evolved from the elegant days of Delahayes, Duesenbergs,
and Packards to the hot droptops of the 1950s, the T-Bird and the
'Vette, the big Lincoln and Cadillac ragtops. In the 1970s, they
virtually disappeared from showrooms.  &UR; Today &LR; , they are making a
big comeback, particularly as Miata-inspired roadsters.
</P>
<P>
   When I got home, I picked up a book, ``The Convertible,'' by Ken
Vose (Chronicle Books, San Francisco; www.chronbooks.com) and
through words and pictures followed his ode to the convertible as
it captured romance, rumble, and revival.
</P>
<P>
   Vose subtitled his book ``An Illustrated History of a Dream
Machine'' and one of the first images you see when you open it is a
shot of Cary Grant and Grace Kelly sitting in a Sunbeam Alpine,
heads in the Mediterranean sun, looking down on Monte Carlo. It's a
shot from the Hitchcock flick, ``To Catch a Thief.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere you find shots of other actresses and actors who added
to the romance of the ragtop: George Maharis and Martin Milner
beside the Corvette in which they roamed ``Route 66''; Susan
Sarandon and Geena Davis _ ``Thelma and Louise'' _ in front of
their '66 T-Bird; and Jack Nicholson and Shirley MacLean in the
'Vette that symbolized his fight against middle-age angst in
``Terms of Endearment.''
</P>
<P>
   The images all speak to one essential of the convertible.
</P>
<P>
   Vose writes: ``Driving a convertible means more than just
freedom of movement. It's also the freedom to enjoy the great
outdoors on an equal footing with the richest of the rich. Put the
top down on your beat-up-mobile, and the sun on your face is
identical to that shining on the guy over there in the Lamborghini
Diablo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ain't that America?,'' in the words of singer John Mellencamp.
</P>
<P>
   Think early convertible and you think 1936 Cord Supercharged
Convertible Coupe. Or, as Vose points out, the elegance of Clark
Gable as manifested in his fine fleet: a 1932 Packard Twin Six, a
1934 Packard Twelve LeBaron, a Rollston-bodied 1934 Duesenberg J, a
1938 Packard Darrin Convertible Victoria, a 1946 Lincoln
Continental, a 1940 Jaguar XK120, and a 1957 Mercedes 300 Sc
cabriolet.
</P>
<P>
   Vose gives us hot rods like the classic 1932 Ford Roadster, and
he gives us James Dean, alive and dead, in his Porsche 356 with the
words ``Little Bastard'' painted on its rear engine cover.
</P>
<P>
   The '50s were a heady time for the convertible and its
popularity rolled into the 1960s when pony cars got droptops, the
Volkswagen Bug took off, and convertible sales hit half a million
by 1965. By 1969, Vose reports, they had dropped to 200,000, and in
1976 the last Cadillac Eldorado convertible _ the only domestic
droptop being built at the time _ rolled off the line.
</P>
<P>
   Were we bored with ourselves, had we lost our sense of
adventure, were we too self-conscious? Did air conditioning and the
fuel crisis help kill the convertible? It seems the '70s, with an
essence of counterculture, should have been a good decade for the
convertible.
</P>
<P>
   Vose quotes Peter Marsh and Peter Collett from their book
``Driving Passion'': ``Convertibles communicate their own
distinctive messages. For many people they evoke not only the true
spirit of motoring, but also a sense of youthful freedom and
nonconformity.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the '70s, nonconformists drove Volkswagen vans and
slant-six Valiants, not convertibles.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the heady '80s, which showed, as Vose writes, ``the
convertible was not dead, it had just gone into hiding, waiting for
a more favorable economic and political environment.''
</P>
<P>
   So Lee Iaccoca, who gave us the minivan, also brought back the
convertible with the Chrysler LeBaron. By the end of the decade,
the Mazda Miata had come ashore and its advent meant the return of
the real two-seat sports roadster. Were it not for the Miata, we
might not  &UR; today &LR;  have the BMW Z3, Porsche Boxster, Mercedes SLK,
Dodge Viper, Plymouth Prowler, or upcoming Audi TT roadster.
</P>
<P>
   Saab's got a droptop and so does Volvo. They seem to be
everywhere again.
</P>
<P>
   You see them driven by young and old, men and women, all out
there in the sun and the wind in a way you cannot be in an enclosed
box. Possibility seems boundless, adventure endless.
</P>
<P>
   It's what convertibles are all about, even on a warm faux fall
day that comes upon us in early January.
</P>
<P>
   Vose captures this essence very well when he quotes an old
British Leyland ad extolling the essence of the Triumph TR-7.
</P>
<P>
   It reads: ``Headroom: 93 million miles.''
</P>
<P>
   So here's to convertibles, to unexpected warm days, and to the
woman in the Saab _ Thelma or Louise _ and many miles in open cars
on open roads.

&HT;     EVEN OLDER WORKERS NEED TO SHARPEN THEIR STREET SMARTS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVE MURPHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Plunging into the working world can baffle a lot of college
students. They may have tons of technical skills, but street smarts
are much harder to acquire. If you don't think so, look at some
foundering 40-year-olds; they still don't have the street smarts
they need to make it.
</P>
<P>
   Here are 10 things every worker should learn, quickly:
</P>
<P>
   _ Get your financial act together.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows which group of people will strike it rich over the
next 30 years, but I can tell you who won't: those who live from
paycheck to paycheck, running up credit card bills instead of
investing.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy when you are young to discount the importance of
money, but understanding how to save and invest is one of the most
crucial career skills. Find a job that can support your lifestyle.
Learn to budget. Understand personal finance, including how to
invest in individual stocks. Then put your money where your future
is.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this survey from the December issue of Money magazine,
when people were asked what they would do in their job if money
were not an issue. Only 25 percent said they would continue to work
full time. Thirty-nine percent said they would work part time, 21
percent would retire completely and 15 percent would become active
volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   People who live from paycheck to paycheck won't have those
options. They can't start their own businesses or retire early or
cut back or risk changing careers. When rumors of layoffs surface,
they'll be the ones having the sleepless nights.
</P>
<P>
   Money can't buy happiness, but it can buy peace of mind.
</P>
<P>
   _ Technology won't go away.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Warren Buffett, possibly the greatest individual
investor of all time. He has said that he won't buy a business he
doesn't understand, so he avoids technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   Many workers can appreciate that sentiment. They don't
understand technology, so they avoid it.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett is a billionaire, meaning he can afford to do what he
damn well pleases. You probably can't. Technology is changing not
just jobs and companies, but entire industries. If you don't
understand it, take the time to learn.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you are no techie, spend an hour or two each year
learning what tech jobs are being invented. As the Web continues to
grow, more high-tech jobs are being created that don't require such
a technical background.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, while the Dow Jones industrial average rose 25 percent
and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index soared 85 percent,
the stock in Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway, fell almost 20
percent. That's pretty much how the job market is going, too.
</P>
<P>
   _ Understand what kind of company you work for.
</P>
<P>
   The first post-college job I had was an exercise in mutual
exploitation. The newspaper hired people straight out of college,
worked them hard and paid them poorly. On the other hand, it also
gave them good experience that allowed them to move on to better
jobs (at other newspapers, of course).
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing wrong with any of that. They used me and I used
them.
</P>
<P>
   But some employees do a good job for a couple of years, then
expect big raises and get frustrated when they don't materialize.
They've forgotten that they would never have been hired in the
first place if the employer weren't an exploiter.
</P>
<P>
   Pick five words to describe your company. If ``cutthroat'' is
one of them, don't expect loyalty. If ``demanding'' is there, don't
expect long vacations. If ``understaffed'' is there, don't complain
about the workload. And if ``quality'' is not there, don't hold
your breath about merit raises.
</P>
<P>
   _ Find co-workers you respect, and learn from them.
</P>
<P>
   If you are at a medium-sized company and you can't find at least
three people worthy of your respect, it means one of two things:
You have outgrown the company and should move on, or you are
incredibly arrogant.
</P>
<P>
   Resist the temptation to get advice only from people who are
just like you: same age, same job, same background, same sex, same
skin color. You'll learn a lot more with a diverse network.
</P>
<P>
   _ Learn what makes other people tick.
</P>
<P>
   Take the time to see things from other people's perspectives.
Without turning yourself into a wreck, what can you do to make
other people's jobs easier? What are you doing to make their jobs
more difficult?
</P>
<P>
   Before you ask for a raise, for example, look at it from your
boss's perspective. It doesn't matter to the company that your
kid's about to go into college, but it does matter that your sales
have increased 15 percent or that you now have more
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   _ Have ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be a constant grumbler, but certainly make constructive
suggestions about how the company can improve.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes this can be a great way to move up if you are feeling
stifled. Identify tasks that no one is now doing but that would
help the company, then offer to do them.
</P>
<P>
   If your boss is rejecting your ideas without adequate
explanation, ask the people you respect for their honest opinions.
If they think the ideas are strong, it may be a sign to change
companies, or at least bosses.
</P>
<P>
   _ Add something to your repertoire each year.
</P>
<P>
   What skill did you add in 1999 that made you a better worker
than you were a year earlier? Did you learn a computer program or
study some management techniques _ or simply learn how to sleep
with your eyes open?
</P>
<P>
   Every skill you have makes you a little more attractive, not
just to your current employer, but to potential ones. It carries an
extra bonus for older workers, helping them overcome the stereotype
of being complacent.
</P>
<P>
   _ The difference between a 30-minute commute and a 10-minute
commute is more than 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Commuting half an hour can sap your energy more than two hours
at the office.
</P>
<P>
   But having a short commute _ or, even better, telecommuting _
can offer you the great workplace luxury of having a relaxing lunch
at home. Don't underestimate how valuable that can be.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't give in to self-pity.
</P>
<P>
   There will be times when you feel stuck in a dead-end job or sad
about getting laid off or angry about discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Experience the emotion, but then move on.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest obstacles to a successful career and a happy
life is when you dwell on mistakes or mistreatment, saying that you
can't accomplish something because of this or because of that.
Don't use that as an excuse for inertia.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep things in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   We live in an age of hyperbole, when people will say and do
extreme things to get attention. E-mail makes it easy to say some
thoughtless and cruel things _ without seeing and hearing the pain
that they cause.
</P>
<P>
   Life isn't like Nordstrom: There are a lot of things you just
can't take back. People may forgive, but they will never forget.

VW EUROVAN SHORT ON FEATURES, BIG ON PRICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember when Arlo Guthrie took a ``half-ton of garbage, put it
in the back of a red VW microbus, took shovels and rakes and
implements of destruction'' and headed out for his Thanksgiving
encounter over littering with the fearsome Officer Obie?
</P>
<P>
   You could do the same with the new 2000 Volkswagen EuroVan GLS,
but there's a hitch: Arlo didn't pay $33,750 for the VW van he
drove in ``Alice's Restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   And that price is my problem with the new EuroVan, descendant of
the old microbus, but more closely descended from the EuroVans of
1980-91, rectangular boxes with 90 horsepower engines.
</P>
<P>
   The folks at VW call the EuroVans ``highly versatile vans for
the adventuresome,'' and say the GLS is ``well equipped.''
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, do I feel as if I'm driving a delivery van as I sit
high in the seat and listen to the roar of the motor seep into the
cab?
</P>
<P>
   At almost $34,000 I'd expect firm leather seats (heated, at
that), double sliding doors (a trend in vans these days), and, hey,
even a glove compartment or a big storage console between the front
seats.
</P>
<P>
   What you get is soft fabric seats that dip at the thigh, no
glove compartment, no console. Storage is limited to slots in the
front doors and sidewalls in the rear. Vans are meant for journeys,
and spartan doesn't work here.
</P>
<P>
   I think that what Volkswagen is offering in the EuroVan is a
base on which to build a camper _ you can add a pop-up roof with a
two-person bed, window screens, a refrigerator, a second battery,
and a two-burner LP gas stove.
</P>
<P>
   But $33,750 is too high a price to pay for a base on which you
build your camper. And as a van in competition with far more
luxurious offerings _ say the Honda Odyssey 5-door with a
navigation system at $28,000, or offerings from Toyota, Mazda,
Ford, and Chevrolet _ the EuroVan is just not plush enough.
</P>
<P>
   And that's too bad, because there are things about the van that
are admirable.
</P>
<P>
   Its 2.8-liter, VR6 engine _ two overhead cams, two-valves per
cylinder, 140 horsepower, 18.4 miles per gallon in a week of
driving _ makes it a virtual rocket in its class. Straight ahead on
hilly country roads or on highways, it's got all the power you
need.
</P>
<P>
   But you can hear that power coming back at you through the
firewall _ and if you happen to have your wipers set on
intermittent, the loud clicks they make with each movement are like
an annoying metronome set to a background rumble.
</P>
<P>
   It's got great heat _ remember the old VW buses with that tiny
metal chimney that rose from floor to dash and heated nothing? _
but the defroster doesn't cover the windshield to its edges.
</P>
<P>
   The EuroVan is front-wheel drive, and a standard low-speed
traction control system should help make it a good winter vehicle.
The ride is fairly smooth on its four-wheel independent suspension,
rack-and-pinion steering is crisp, and ABS-assisted four-wheel disc
brakes bring it to quick stops.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a very tall box and the suspension that gives it a
comfortable straight-ahead ride can't compensate for that high
center of gravity. Occupants are at the mercy of strong lateral
forces in turns.
</P>
<P>
   If you suddenly come upon a sharp turn at a good speed, the feel
of the steering wheel does not instill confidence as you roll into
the turn, and I had the sensations of both oversteer and understeer
at various times.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, it's got a rigid, rugged body, and safety
features include dual front airbags and side impact beams in the
doors.
</P>
<P>
   Standard equipment includes power door locks, cruise control, a
6-speaker AM-FM radio with cassette player, heated windshield
washer nozzles, power outside mirrors, and a four-speed automatic
transmission.
</P>
<P>
   Zoned climate control for the rear is a nice touch, as are
focused reading lights that let passengers read without interfering
with the driver's vision.
</P>
<P>
   The rear cargo area, with roll-up cover, seems cavernous, though
a brighter light for finding gear at night would be nice. But,
because the van is so tall, I'm not sure how a short person _ say
under 5-foot-4 _ would close the heavy rear hatch once it has been
opened; it swings well up and out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a Volkswagen fan. The Golf, New Beetle, Jetta, and Passat
are all wonderful cars sold at good prices.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen is a company broadening its offerings, from
high-powered Beetles to a 12-cylinder luxury sedan, and it is
cutting edge in much of what it already offers.
</P>
<P>
   But with the EuroVan, it's a company behind the times in terms
of passenger comfort and convenience. If they want to sell campers,
they should just build them fully loaded and sell them as such.

CUSTOMIZED WEB BEGINS WITH A JOKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ken Goldberg isn't a card-carrying comedian. He's never sweated
through open mike night at some seedy, basement bar. He's never
bombed before a convention of drunk dentists nor has he ever felt
the cool breeze of a tomato cruising past his ear. All the same, he
and his colleagues think they can predict what jokes make you
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   How? It's all in the math.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg, an associate professor of industrial engineering at
the University of California at Berkeley, has created a program
called Jester 2.0 that serves as a kind of Joke-o-Meter. At the
Jester Web site (eigentaste.berkeley.edu), you are asked to rate a
series of jokes on a scale of Not Funny to Very Funny. Based on
those responses, the system lumps you with people who share similar
opinions and sends you jokes that they enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not magic,'' says Goldberg. ``It's statistical pattern
recognition. You don't need to know anything about humor.''
</P>
<P>
   But does it actually work? Well, yes and no. Goldberg and his
team of graduate students chose jokes designed to elicit a strong
response. We're talking light bulb jokes, Clinton jokes, pope
jokes, gender jokes, everything but knock-knock jokes. After I
rated dozens of them, the system gave up and announced, ``Sorry,
Jester could not find any personalized joke recommendations for
you.''
</P>
<P>
   That happens, Goldberg explains, in rare circumstances when
users have particularly strong (and well-defined) tastes. ``There
are certainly improvements that can be made, but this technique has
enormous potential,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Enormous potential, indeed. The good professor has signed on as
an adviser at a company called NetCustomize Corp., which is
striving to perfect the technology in the commercial arena. It is
currently offering a joke delivery service called eLOL (as in
``electronic laugh out loud''). You sign up for the free service at
elol.com, and then you receive jokes on your desktop every day at
the time of your choice. You can also specify how many jokes you
want to receive as well as what kind _ ranging from one-liners and
stories to videos and cartoons. You rate the jokes, and after a
time, the system tailors the yuks to your particular taste.
</P>
<P>
   So why does it keep sending me the kind of jokes that could get
me accused of sexual harassment? For some reason, the comedians in
my computer seem to think I enjoy only off-color humor, the bawdier
the better (as in full-screen, full frontal). No matter how many
times I rate a joke with a groan, I still receive similar fare.
(You can request that the service deliver only clean, politically
correct jokes, but we have nothing against the occasional adult
joke as long as it's funny.)
</P>
<P>
   Shuki Nir, CEO and cofounder of NetCustomize, insists that I'm
an anomaly. ``It's not about dirty vs. nondirty,'' he says. ``There
is no relevancy to the category itself. It's a matter of taste _
meaning the quality of the joke and how funny you find it compared
with other people,'' he adds, noting that, so far, 70 percent of
eLOL users have given the system high grades. ``I guess you fall in
the 30.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, is it really possible to quantify something as
elusive as taste? ``That's the million-dollar question,'' says
Goldberg. Indeed. The folks at Amazon.com have been trying to
figure it out for years by offering personal recommendations to
users based on past purchases. As any Amazon user knows, though,
the suggestions aren't always perfect. If you ordered a book on
thermodynamics for your dear Uncle Charlie a few months ago, you
might still be receiving recommendations for books with titles like
``Absolute Zero and the Conquest of Cold.''
</P>
<P>
   But think of the time you could save if there really is a
mathematical formula for taste. The infinite expanse of the
Internet has created a need for personalized filters. ``I started
this business from my personal frustration with having too much
entertainment content delivered at the wrong time with low
quality,'' says Nir, who plans to launch a service offering
customized music and video content starting in April.
</P>
<P>
   And there are many other dot coms trying to perfect the
technology; one Connecticut-based outfit called MeTV.com aims to
offer a customized movie rental service over the Internet in June.
The goal? When it comes to entertainment, everyone ought to be able
to say, ``It's all about me.''
</P>
<P>
   So for now, it's up to the engineers and scientists to figure
out the appropriate algorithm for taste. Isn't there something a
tad bit bizarre about that concept? ``Nothing around here is
strange these days,'' says Goldberg. ``I mean, I'm at Berkeley,
right?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

<P>
   Last of the Y2K Bugs: The Y2K watchers turned out to have a
rather slow evening, when the New Year turned into a nonevent. Now,
one final attempt to cash in on the ``crisis'' has gone bust. The
folks at www.year2000.com, a profitable Y2K watch venture,
auctioned off the domain name on eBay, reporting a winning bid of
$10 million. But the bid turned out to be a fraud, and the name was
still up for sale. After all that hype, something had to go wrong,
didn't it?

GETTING A GRIP ON OPTIMISM IS A REAL DRAG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A story in Monday's paper reported that researchers are
``finally getting a grip on optimism.''
</P>
<P>
   A curious picture came to mind, a half dozen or so
serious-looking scientists struggling to subdue a large, bright,
slippery mass. As any pessimist knows, nothing is harder to get a
grip on than optimism. In fact, the whole notion of being able to
grip it at all seems absurd, given its elusive nature.
</P>
<P>
   The story reported that the researchers found optimists do
better than pessimists in every area of life, work, school, and
sports. They achieve more goals, suffer less depression, battle
illness more effectively. They live longer.
</P>
<P>
   Haven't we heard this before? It seems researchers are
constantly discovering that optimists do better than pessimists and
announcing their findings to the media. How many times do they have
to rediscover it?
</P>
<P>
   I come at this subject as a bred-in-the-bone pessimist, born of
people who would no more think of looking on the bright side of
life than they would of telling you to have a nice day. I suspect
optimists don't really live longer. The truth is pessimists live
shorter, for any number of reasons, not the least of which is that
optimists are so damned irritating, wearing us down, telling us to
cheer up, be happy, smile.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Seligman, a University of Pennsylvania psychologist, is
quoted in the story as saying that in the past three decades there
were 46,000 papers on depression in psychology literature and
``just 400'' on joy. Things will be different in the 21st century,
Seligman predicts, when psychology ``will become a science of human
strength and personal fulfillment.''
</P>
<P>
   Seligman is a respected expert on the subject. As it happens,
I've read his book, ``Learned Optimism: How to Change Your Mind and
Your Life.'' It was published in 1990 to enthusiastic reviews
(``Vaulted me out of my funk. . .'' _ The New York Times) and has
been selling briskly ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Seligman believes that optimism and pessimism are learned
behaviors. He's undoubtedly right, although, looking at my
relations I can't help thinking that at least some of it must be
genetic. In his book, he provides cognitive therapy techniques
designed to turn the pessimist into an optimist. The key lies in
changing what Seligman calls your ``explanatory style,'' how you
view and explain your life experience. He provides a test of 48
scenarios designed to test the reader's level of optimism. Here's
one example:
</P>
<P>
   You win the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   A. It was pure chance.
</P>
<P>
   B. I picked the right numbers.
</P>
<P>
   I chose A, the pessimistic answer. When something good happens
to pessimists they assume it was due to circumstances outside
themselves. Conversely, when something bad happens, it's always
their fault.
</P>
<P>
   Optimists do exactly the opposite. They breeze happily through
life taking credit for everything that goes right and blaming
outside circumstances for anything that goes wrong.
</P>
<P>
   There's something to be said for optimism, in moderation, but to
choose answer B, ``I picked the right numbers,'' and ignore the
element of chance seems unrealistic, if not insane. But what do I
know? I'm a die-hard pessimist, too far gone to be vaulted out of
my funk by ``learned optimism.''
</P>
<P>
   In his book Seligman concedes that pessimism has one good use:
It helps people perceive reality accurately. He writes that
depressed people, who tend to be pessimists, ``see reality
correctly while non-depressed people distort reality in a
self-serving way. . . . There is considerable evidence that
depressed people, though sadder, are wiser.''
</P>
<P>
   We're wise enough, at least, to know we'll never get a grip on
optimism.

CARTOONISTS TAKE SHOTS AT UN CONTEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It looked benign enough; in fact, it seemed downright
impressive: An international political cartooning contest under the
auspices of the United Nations Correspondents Association with a
top prize of $10,000 to be awarded ``in the presence of'' UN
Secretary General Kofi Annan next October. The distinguished panel
of judges includes Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel, author Norman
Mailer, and First Amendment attorney Floyd Abrams.
</P>
<P>
   But the competition _ officially called the ``Ranan Lurie
Political Cartoon Award'' in honor of the well-known cartoonist _
has provoked the ire of some top cartoonists, who see the contest
and Lurie as unrepresentative of their craft's loftier principles.
The moral of the story is that cartooning and diplomacy just don't
mix.
</P>
<P>
   A letter signed by a number of cartoonists and addressed to
Annan, Wiesel, and Erol Avdovic, president of the UN Correspondents
Association, states that ``you should not lend your name or
organization's reputation to (a contest) fated for ridicule.
Regardless of your most honorable motives, to most of us you look
like you don't know what you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Problem number one seems to be the contest's designation of
Lurie as ``the world's leading political cartoonist.'' (The
contest's Web site abounds with accolades for Lurie, whose resume
includes stints at Newsweek, ``The MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour,'' and
U.S. News &AMP; World Report and who has interviewed more than 70 world
leaders.) Skeptics see him as overrated and overhyped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ranan Lurie is a huge self-promoter. No one sees his cartoons,
but he manages to convince everybody he's the best cartoonist in
the world. (He) is inconsequential,'' says Philadelphia Daily News
cartoonist Signe Wilkinson.
</P>
<P>
   The contest ``seemed like a joke,'' adds noted cartoonist Jules
Feiffer. ``The notion that anybody can be named best cartoonist in
the world is nonsensical.'' And Lurie, he suggests, is a dubious
pick for that designation.
</P>
<P>
   The letter writers' other major bone to pick is the contest rule
that entries ``should not malign member nations or their leaders.''
The idea that cartoonists _ who often function as bomb-lobbing
iconoclasts _ should make nice with world leaders doesn't sit too
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to encourage cartoonists in Third World countries
that might get thrown in jail, I'm all for that,'' says syndicated
cartoonist Jeff Danziger. ``The fact that we're not supposed to be
critical of world leaders is ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, Danziger hasn't received a response to the letter,
which was sent out late last year. And suffice it to say that the
matter hasn't exactly reached the UN Security Council. The Globe
could not reach Avdovic, and through a spokesman, Wiesel said he
wasn't aware of any contest controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Shashi Tharoor, director of communications and special projects
for the Office of the UN Secretary General, says, ``We fully
respect the right of any group of cartoonists to dislike the work
of any other cartoonist,'' and notes that the contest ``was not
something that Kofi Annan had signed on to explicitly.'' But he
defends the nonmalign rule, saying ``the best example of
international cooperation is not one in which you show a particular
member state's posterior sticking out.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Lurie ``definitely agree(s) that I'm not the
greatest cartoonist in the world. I certainly don't expect anyone
to follow in my footsteps. On the contrary, the less competition
the better.'' The contest was meant to celebrate ``the good deeds
and the spirit of the United Nations. It's like we're giving an
award for golf, not for boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wilkinson says her ilk simply don't belong at a clubby place
like the United Nations, where collective harmony is the goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cartoonists,'' she says, ``are true eccentrics.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Everybody's talking about it in the wake of Monday's stunning
AOL-Time Warner deal. New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd
mentioned that although she worked at Time in the '80s and ``didn't
hold onto my Time stock . . . many of my old colleagues became
multimillionaires'' on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Salon magazine quoted one People magazine staffer saying that
``everyone has their calculators on their desk,'' recalibrating the
value of their 401Ks. The New York Observer chronicled the words of
a Time Inc. editor who said, ``The mood is framed by the sound of
(stock) options exercising.'' And the New York Post reported that
``between 1,000 and 2,000 of the 12,000 employees at Time Inc.
alone are worth more than $1 million or more in Time Warner
stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to an overlooked implication of the world of new media
and mergers. Are journalists now so invested in the boom economy
that they can no longer objectively report on that subject?
</P>
<P>
   ``The AOL Time Warner merger . . . now adds another dimension to
the notion of media bias. Can journalists avoid conflicts of
economic interests?'' writes Trevor Butterworth in a shrewd essay
for Newswatch, the on-line media site produced by the Center for
Media and Public Affairs. Since Monday's deal, journalists
everywhere _ despite a notorious ineptitude at math _ are spending
as much time muttering about stocks and early retirement as any
Wall Street broker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think this is going to be the issue (for media
critics) to debate in the next decade,'' says Butterworth.

DOUGLAS COUPLAND: THE PUCK OF POP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ No one has to tell Douglas Coupland how inescapably
his name is linked with ``Generation X,'' a term he unleashed on an
unsuspecting world as the title of his debut novel. But even
Coupland was startled when Alex Trebek, that unacknowledged
legislator of cultural immortality, took the linkage to a whole new
plane two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around 7:20 in the evening,'' Coupland explains, ``my phone
just rang off the hook: `Oh, you're a ``Jeopardy'' question!' That
was really cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Coolness is a subject Coupland (pronounced COPE-land) knows
something about. Few novelists writing today have so vividly
communicated the grain of the contemporary. Not since Tom Wolfe has
a writer of fact, fiction, or both, illuminated _ let alone
carbonated _ as many subcultures.
</P>
<P>
   From slackers not so down but very out in Palm Springs
(``Generation X,'' 1991) to software geeks coding their lives away
in Palo Alto (``Microserfs,'' 1995) to denizens of the
beauty-pageant circuit and the fringes of Hollywood (``Miss
Wyoming,'' his new novel), Coupland has shown himself to be an
inspired phrasemaker and fanatically detailed observer of the way
we live now. In the process, he's staked out a special place on the
literary landscape: beyond cult figure yet not quite housebroken
enough for the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   His talents have earned Coupland a global following. He's been
translated into 22 languages, and upwards of 20 Web sites are
dedicated to Coupland and his work. ``Many people, particularly
young people, identify closely with his writings,'' says Paula
Hightower, who oversees one such site, www.squeakie.com/coupland.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the mystique surrounding Coupland is that novels are
just a part of what he does. Trained as a sculptor, he designs
furniture and has done a series of brief ``art spots'' for MTV (the
spots, as well as the furniture and much else besides, can be
viewed on Coupland's own Web site, www.coupland.com). He also has a
small film production company, works as a futurist for the Global
Business Network, and is a contributing editor of Wired.
</P>
<P>
   Coupland embodies a kind of post-glamour, wetware-based,
Y2K-and-away hipness that's at once boyish and shrewd. Mention the
word hip, however, and Coupland's brows jump. ``I'm wearing a gray
cashmere V-neck! I'm 38-and-a-week old!'' And it's certainly true
that his balding pate and rabbity cheeks will never earn him a spot
on the cover of GQ. Nor, for that matter, will his diet get him on
the cover of Gourmet: Lunch consists of half a large Toblerone bar,
a pot of coffee, and fruit salad (consumed in that order).
</P>
<P>
   Yet in person, as on the page, appearance is the least of what
makes Coupland what he is. Extremely bright and self-aware, he
performs a sort of nonstop existential stand-up, one minute summing
up the questionable splendor of an overdone hotel lobby (``At home
with the Ceausescus!''), the next offering to crouch for a
photographer in the pose of Andy Warhol's famous silk screen of
Elvis (the photographer demurs). The overall effect is of a highly
caffeinated Puck, equally at home in a Starbucks or the Forest of
Arden.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, Coupland lives in the New World equivalent of the
Forest of Arden (more or less), Vancouver, British Columbia, and
being Canadian has played its part in Coupland's success: while
utterly at home with American culture, he's able to bring to it an
outsider's insights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the relationship of the future,'' Coupland says
of the United States and Canada. ``You have had an entirely
permeable membrane between the two (countries) for as long as
they've been in existence. Everything American _ movies, magazines,
television _ coming through. It's about as close a metaphor as you
can get for utter and total globalization. Yet there still remain
the differences. So, for anyone who's freaking out about
globalization, I say: Look, the very worst it can get is Canada and
the States.''
</P>
<P>
   Where American culture overwhelms Canadians, Canadian culture
distinctly underwhelms Americans (``I warn you,'' Coupland says,
``the moment you say `Canada' to Americans they fall asleep or turn
the page''). Yet Celine Dion and, yes, Alex Trebek notwithstanding,
there have been certain other Canadians + Glenn Gould, Neil Young,
David Cronenberg, the SCTV people, Marshall McLuhan _ whose
energetically inexplicable careers suggest there's a lot more to
the great white north than hockey players and Mounties. It is very
much to this other Canadian tradition that Coupland belongs.
</P>
<P>
   A child of the Cold War, he was born on a NATO base in Germany,
the third of four sons. The family moved to Vancouver in 1965, and
Coupland's parents still live in the house he grew up in. If the
tribute he wrote for his high school class' 10th reunion is any
indication (it can be found on his Web site), Coupland enjoyed a
painless _ if also, as he says, ``understimulated'' _ adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   He went to art school in Vancouver, then spent two years in
Japan. A postcard he sent home caught the eye of a local editor,
who gave him some writing assignments. He moved to Toronto and
turned to fiction. St. Martin's, the publisher of ``Generation X,''
envisioned the book as a comic throwaway title, a handbook.
Coupland had other ideas.
</P>
<P>
   There were two great ironies to the success of ``Generation X.''
One was that its author is a Baby Boomer. Coupland makes the
demographic cut-off, Dec. 31, 1964, by three years and a day. Not
that this fact bothers him. ``There's this boomer sensibility to
use the first-person plural,'' he says. `` `We' did this and `we'
do that. The moment you find people using only the first-person
singular, I think that's when you've entered X territory. Which is
where I would put myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The other irony was that the greatest influence on this literary
sensation wasn't another writer but an artist. ``One of the great
regrets of my life is that I never got to see or meet Andy
Warhol,'' Coupland says. ``The first hardcover I ever bought was a
Warhol biography, by John Coplans. It was $10 back in 1970, '71. It
was the most expensive thing I'd ever bought. I was almost faint
from having spent that much money.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a wise investment. Warhol's writing style and Coupland's
_ flat, direct, aphoristic, surreally mundane _ show marked
affinities; and as is immediately apparent from the look of his Web
site, Coupland remains very much indebted to Pop Art generally.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I still remember looking in the World Book Encyclopedia _ I
was in elementary school _ `P' for `Pop Art,' back in '69, '70. It
was pretty new back then even. They probably had arguments over at
World Book headquarters whether to include it. There was Roy
Lichtenstein's `Blam!,' an exploding plane, and I think the (Warhol
Campbell's) soup can. It was one of those things: That's it, that's
me, done!
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm realizing now is, I've gone for eight years now with
people saying how can you put Pop stuff in books? What I finally
figured out is after World War II popular culture and visual
academic culture melded together and they've been melded together
ever since. From what I can tell about the literary world,
literature and pop culture have always been separate spheres and
they've never joined. If you're an academic, that's how you're
trained, that's what you think it is. But I got just the opposite:
How can you not put pop culture in something? Our world is just so
insanely Pop. Everything's Pop these days.''

   Coupland's fiction has the vibrancy of Pop Art _ the goofball
slyness as well as the eyeball-blasting color _ but it has also
boasted the verisimilitude of first-rate journalism. As Hightower
points out, he has a genius for perceiving ``the tiny details that
one might encounter in day-to-day life.'' Certainly, Coupland is a
demon reporter. ``Between 1989 and 1997 or so, I did not go
anywhere without a notebook that could fit in my pocket. . . . Then
around '97, whatever I was doing became internal. So that with
`Miss Wyoming' there's not a single note for it. . . . Now it all
just comes out of my head, and because it comes out of my head I
think it's a bit more emotionally driven than artifactually or
environmentally driven.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of an improbable romance between a burned-out film
producer and a former child star, ``Miss Wyoming'' is a marked
departure for Coupland. The first book he's written in the third
person, it takes daring liberties with narrative structure. The
prose is more restrained. The tension between authorial attitude
and spiritual yearning, something central to Coupland's fiction,
approaches a balance it hasn't previously attained.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly any other writer, ``Miss Wyoming'' would seem like a
technical advance. For Coupland, it seems almost like a throwback _
which he takes as a compliment. ``All the things people learn in
English 101,'' he says, ``I had to learn six books later, the hard
way. In one way I'm glad, because it kept my voice my own voice.''
</P>
<P>
   The larger point is that ``Miss Wyoming'' marks a deepening of
his commitment to the novel. For all that he does so many other
things, writing is what most matters to him. ``If you one by one
stripped away the things from (my) life, writing would be the last
thing. I think that without writing there would be no me. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think book writing is therapy. It's not a cry for
help, and books aren't contrived (if you contrive a book, it's
cynical and not going to work). . . . One of the misconceptions
that hovers around me is that the books are thought of in advance,
like high concept or something. If only it was that easy! If life
was that easy, every car Detroit made would be a hit, every song
would go to No. 1. If only the world was so together that you could
plan things out like that _ and it's not.
</P>
<P>
   He pauses, then gives his little-boy grin. ``Well, maybe Michael
Crichton can.''

<P>
   If the Quincy garbage dump is ever declared a toxic waste site
by the federal government, I'll be partly to blame.
</P>
<P>
   In last week's column, I mentioned recently tossing an old
monitor of mine into the trash. The same day, an e-mail arrived
from the Massachusetts Executive Office of Environmental Affairs.
The state's chief waste watcher, Bob Durand, wasn't pleased with
me.
</P>
<P>
   You probably know that the cathode ray tubes in TV sets and most
computer monitors fire a stream of electrons to draw pictures on
the screen. Why aren't those same electrons bombarding you? Because
the screen is lined with lead _ cheap, tough, plentiful, and
poisonous, especially to young children.
</P>
<P>
   Tossing out a monitor means dumping toxic lead into a local
landfill. Worse yet, it might be fed to an incinerator, where the
flames will vaporize the lead and send it wafting out a smokestack
and into some little girl's lungs. Then there are the computers
themselves. Microelectronics are richly salted with toxins _
mercury, arsenic, cadmium, and also lead. So my careless disposal
of an old monitor could have grim consequences down the road.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why doing what I did with my old monitor will be
illegal in Massachusetts come April. Instead, we'll have to discard
old computers the same way we dump old refrigerators _ by having a
special waste hauling service pick them up, or carry them to an
approved recycling center.
</P>
<P>
   The monitor was well and truly dead; otherwise I'd have kept it.
But corporations and organizations routinely toss out millions of
computers and monitors that work perfectly, but have become
obsolete. Durand said 500,000 tons of old computer gear will be
discarded in the next five years, in Massachusetts alone.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of machines are going to community organizations that
fix them up and sell them cheap to schools, nonprofits, and poor
families. Unfortunately, one such outfit, the East-West Education
Development Foundation, is quitting the business. High rents drove
it out of its 15,000-square-foot warehouse on the Boston
waterfront. It now has a much smaller location, and foundation
president Steven Farrell says, ``we have found it simply physically
impossible to refurbish sufficient equipment in a week's time to
meet our expenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Some others are still hanging on. Mindshare Collaborative, a
South Boston group, refurbished 75 computers last month, reselling
them for about $245 each, to cover the cost of the upgrade.
Mindshare and most other such operations will only accept
relatively new PCs with a Pentium processor or better. Older PCs or
Apple Macintosh computers are too slow or incompatible for use even
by poor folks. And the nonprofits can't keep up with all the newer
computers being thrown away after just a couple of years' use.
</P>
<P>
   This problem would have seemed like a splendid opportunity to my
late father. He sold second- and third-hand stuff at Chicago's
Maxwell Street flea market, where his motto was, ``That's not junk,
that's merchandise!'' Maybe not to you or me, but to somebody,
somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   China, for instance. Every month, Michael Tobias of Seattle
fills four, 40-foot shipping containers with computers and monitors
and ships them off to Chinese buyers. ``Once there they'll be
Frankensteined together into some usable computers,'' says Tobias,
founder of Next Generation Environmental Service LLC.
(www.nextgenenvironmental.com), which collects old PCs at 10
locations nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``From one company alone,'' says Tobias, ``I'm getting rid of
40,000 systems.'' He charges about $25 per monitor and $20 per
computer. Some companies insist that their machines be destroyed
and the parts recycled; others just want them gone, and these are
the machines that end up in China.
</P>
<P>
   But the world is producing computers even faster than China is
producing computer users. In the long run, we'll either have to
recycle all our old computers, or go back to using the
biodegradable kind _ pencils and paper.

GORE TARGETS BRADLEY'S TOBACCO ROOTS, RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After months of hearing Al Gore call him a pawn of
New Jersey pharmaceutical interests, former Senator Bill Bradley
used the vice president's ties to Tennessee's tobacco industry this
week to label Gore a friend of ``Big Tobacco.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore quickly responded by claiming to have ``led the fight
against smoking'' and denying Bradley's charge.
</P>
<P>
   But while Gore has helped lead the Clinton administration's
efforts to reduce teen-age smoking in recent years, congressional
and legal records have shown that as a member of Congress he
regularly interceded on behalf of tobacco interests.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, for example, when the tobacco industry was mounting a
losing fight against a bill to require stronger warning labels on
cigarette packages and other tobacco products and advertising,
then-Representative Gore championed a compromise that diluted the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, tobacco companies' internal files were
subsequently produced in landmark class-action cases. The files
reflect a high industry regard for Gore's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1984 speech prepared by Arthur Stevens, the general counsel
for Lorillard Tobacco, for a gathering of tobacco executives, the
lawyer listed the ways that Gore's compromise had changed the
labeling bill.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry was on the run, Stevens wrote, with
``nothing between'' the bill's passage but the ``frail defense'' of
a handful of tobacco-state senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that our defense was virtually nonexistant,'' Stevens
wrote. ``Rather than draw three cards to make a low inside
straight, the industry dealt itself a new hand. We worked out a
compromise. The final version was offered by Congressman Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``How does the compromise differ?'' Stevens asked. ``Well,
first, the warning statements are all attributed to the surgeon
general _ not the United States government. Second, the words
`death' and `addiction' are dropped. Third, the ugly circle and
arrow format _ a virtual self-defacement _ is out. Fourth, the
requirement to submit a list of ingredients had been improved to
provide for better confidentiality. Fifth, the provision of
$100,000 in criminal penalties has been eliminated.''
</P>
<P>
   The draft of the Stevens speech is posted on the Internet, at a
Web site maintained by the foes of the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Gore was running for the US Senate in Tennessee. He
acknowledged then that that ``the health community had to make
significant concessions,'' but he voiced pride in his efforts to
broker a compromise that resulted in tougher labeling than had been
called for by the existing law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I . . . want to congratulate the tobacco industry and all
their representatives who helped make this compromise possible,''
Gore said at the time. ``This bill represents a progressive and
courageous step by this industry that many did not expect. This has
been a bitter pill to swallow, but in so doing they have made
stiffer punitive legislation less likely in the years ahead . . . I
applaud them for their efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, the vice president's spokesman, defended Gore's
overall record Wednesday. ``If you look at what this administration
has done, no one has fought big tobacco more vigorously at the
national level in this administration than Al Gore,'' Lehane said.
``He has fought to protect our children.''
</P>
<P>
   But tobacco is a sensitive issue for Gore, who comes from one of
the nation's largest tobacco-growing states, with 100,000 tobacco
farmers. Gore employs some of the tobacco industry's top political
consultants, including a media adviser, Carter Eskew, in his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it speaks a lot about Al Gore that he would have on
his staff a top adviser who was critical to designing the tobacco
industry's attack on the tobacco bill,'' said Gary Ruskin, who
heads the Congressional Accountability Project. ``It is an enormous
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Gore gave an emotional speech at the Democratic
National Convention, describing in some detail his sister Nancy's
``unbearable pain'' and death from lung cancer in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters quickly found that Gore had been a consistent
supporter in Congress of the federal tobacco allotment program, and
that he continued to accept campaign contributions from the tobacco
industry, as well as federal tobacco allotment payments, for six
years after his sister died.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Gore responded to the media's questions by saying
``emotional numbness'' caused him to continue to defend the tobacco
industry and accept such payments.
</P>
<P>
   As a presidential candidate in 1988, Gore opposed restrictions
on tobacco advertising and defended the virtues of tobacco farming.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told an audience in North Carolina that he was committed to
the ``small farmers, tens of thousands of whom find it possible to
remain on the farm because they have that extra few thousand
dollars each year.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting how the Gore family farm had relied on tobacco and
federal price supports over the years, he said, ``I've plowed the
ground, put in the seed beds, I've planted it, hoed it, wormed it,
suckered it, cut it, spiked it, put it in the barns, stripped it,
and sold it. I know what it's about, how important that way of life
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, in a news release posted on his Web site Tuesday, noted
that in 1985 Gore had voted against an amendment that Bradley
offered to stop the tobacco tax from dropping from 16 cents to 8
cents. The difference in revenue would have been devoted to
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, according to Senate voting records, Gore voted to
support a federal program to sell 1.2 billion pounds of surplus
tobacco at cut-rate prices to the tobacco companies. Bradley voted
against it.

ON ISRAELI SLOPES, DIPLOMACY TAKES A BACK SEAT TO THE SCHUSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT HERMON, Golan Heights _ At the peak of this volcanic
mountain blanketed in snow, a blue-white Israeli flag whipped in
the icy wind as a chairlift deposited Israeli skiers onto the
slopes.
</P>
<P>
   The Mount Hermon Ski Area was overrun this week with skiers and
tobogganers set loose on roughly 3 feet of soft white powder that
had fallen since Sunday in the Golan's first real snowstorm in two
years.
</P>
<P>
   The glee of children taking runs on plastic sleds or skiers
cascading down the hills seemed far removed from the bloody battles
for control that took place on this strategic highground in the
Arab-Israeli wars of 1967 and 1973.
</P>
<P>
   It was equally worlds away from the difficult high-level
diplomacy in Shepherdstown, W. Va., where control of Mount Hermon
was a central issue as Syria sought the return of the Golan in
exchange for security guarantees for Israel and an end to the
half-century state of war between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
   Every voice on the question _ Israeli hardliners, Peace Now
activists, the ultra-Orthodox and the completely secular, along
with Israeli Arabs and ethnic Druze who claim loyalty to Syria _
could be heard on Mount Hermon this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you see that? That is Syria, and that is Damascus,'' said
an Israeli soldier stationed on the hill, who because of military
regulations could only give his first name, Sefi.
</P>
<P>
   On one side of Mount Hermon the view is of red-tiled roofs of
Israeli ski lodges and settlements; on the other is the gray
skyline of Syria's capital, Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you see how close that is? You can visualize how insane it
would be for us to give this up? The settlements will be sitting
ducks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the parking lot, Kamal Hussein, was furiously trying to
direct the traffic jam caused by some 25,000 who descended on the
slopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This mountain belongs to Syria,'' said Hussein, a member of
the Druze community on the Israeli-held Golan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is to be peace, it will have to be returned,'' said
Hussein. ``Besides, if this is real peace, the Israelis can still
come skiing here even if the mountain is under Syrian control. Why
not?''
</P>
<P>
   The scene was winter wonderland-Middle East style, full of
bizarre vignettes. Israel soldiers wearing military green winter
suits and carrying machine guns mixed with skiers in silky spandex
snowpants and backpacks with picnic lunches. Atop the hill, a
military early warning station monitored Syrian troop movements
while just below it young children on sleds whipped past an Israeli
troop transport parked nearby. Ultra-Orthodox tourists looked a bit
lost amid the crowds of Israeli Arabs smoking water pipes and
playing traditional drums in the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I look like a skier?'' asked Joseph Ausch, 40, a member of
the Satmar stream of ultra-Orthodox Judaism, in the traditional
long beard, side curls, black wool suit, and fedora.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just rented a car to see what the place looked like. We had
no idea all these Arabs would be here,'' said Ausch, who lives in
Munson, N.Y. and was in Israel on business. ``Well, looks like
they're amusing themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Six-Day War in June of 1967, an intense 20-hour
battle resulted in Israel taking the Golan Heights. When the
fighting ended in a ceasefire on June 10, Israel had left
neighboring Egypt, Jordan, and Syria _ which combined had
significantly superior military power _ stunned and defeated.
</P>
<P>
   The victory left Israel in control of the Golan, the West Bank,
and the Sinai Peninsula _ an area three times its pre-1967 borders.
In the 1973 war, Israel repelled a furious assault in the Golan and
ended by recapturing one peak of Mount Hermon and taking another.
</P>
<P>
   The Six-Day War's toll was 700 Israeli lives and 2,500 wounded.
Syria suffered about 1,000 casualties; Egypt 1,500; and Jordan
claims to have lost about 6,000. In 1973, nearly 3,000 Israelis
were killed, several hundred on the Golan alone, while more than
3,000 Syrians were killed in fierce armor and commando battles for
the strategic heights.
</P>
<P>
   Standing next to Ausch was his Israeli friend, Steve Weiss, who
added, ``We gave too many lives to get this mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel is always giving'' in the peace process, said Weiss. Of
the Syrians and Palestinians, he asked, ``What have they ever
given?''
</P>
<P>
   There is much at stake in the Golan, not only the sacrifice of
lives on both sides, but economic interest as well.
</P>
<P>
   Today 17,000 Israeli settlers live in the Golan, which contains
roughly one-third of Israel's water resources and bountiful
orchards and vineyards.
</P>
<P>
   The ski area itself is an example of the kind of lost business
that would have to be compensated if the Golan goes back to Syria.
Menachem Baruch, the manager, said the 9 lifts and 45 trails were
built in 1969 by a consortium of 32 families from the nearby town
of Newe Ativ. He estimates the business is worth $65 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will do everything we can to oppose it,'' he said,
referring to Prime Minister Ehud Barak's peace plan. ``In the
meantime, we have to continue to work and invest. You can't do
that, if you think next year you won't be here.''

 &HT;    In search of the true King
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Jan. 16.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, in an interview about her efforts to carry
on her late husband's work, Coretta Scott King told me that it
wouldn't surprise her to one day see a new religion based on the
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s philosophy of nonviolence. In some
ways, the widow's prophecy has come true. A broad spectrum of
people treat King's most famous words as holy Scripture: Few
dispute their truth, but many argue over what they mean. The image
of King preserved in the public mind is more messianic than mortal.
The ``I Have a Dream'' speech is his Sermon on the Mount; the
balcony of Memphis' Lorraine Motel is his Calvary.
</P>
<P>
   And now, just as there have been books promising to portray the
real Jesus, Michael Eric Dyson has written ``I May Not Get There
With You: The True Martin Luther King Jr.'' Dyson, an ordained
Baptist minister, Columbia University professor of African-American
studies and the author of four previous books whose subjects
include Malcolm X and gangsta rap, says his aim is to ``keep Dr.
King alive, the way he really was.''
</P>
<P>
   It's audacious even to state the need for that task, much less
take it on, given that King's life has been written about so
thoroughly, including in two Pulitzer Prize-winning books. What's
more, the opening of Dyson's account may convince some readers that
he's not up to the job. He starts with narrative writing that is,
at best, awkward: ``King's mellifluous baritone had been silenced
by a piece of metal that traveled with ungodly speed and accuracy
to explode its message of death inside his neck.''
</P>
<P>
   Readers who persevere, however, will be rewarded. Dyson moves
from telling a story to arguing his case, and that is where he hits
his stride. He takes on individuals and groups ranging from
affirmative action opponents to right-to-life zealots, indicting
them for appropriating King's words for uses that run counter to
the man's mission in life. The case has been made many places
before. But few, if any, have made it in the cogent, comprehensive
and passionate way Dyson does.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson's criticism isn't limited to conservative usurpers of
King's lectures and likeness, such as anti-affirmative action
activist Ward Connerly of California or Republican Sen. Jesse Helms
of North Carolina. Though he shows compassion for King's widow and
grown children, Dyson rightly questions their stewardship of King's
legacy for its emphasis on protecting the commercial value of his
words and image at the risk of lessening their ability to continue
changing the world.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Dyson can't deliver the ``true'' Martin Luther King
Jr. simply by skewering those who misappropriate King's message. He
fulfills his promise by going much further. The book reminds us of
the King we've forgotten, a man whose career in the public eye
lasted just 13 years but who went through many changes in that
time, including struggles with disillusionment and depression near
the end of a short life filled with incredible accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, Dyson looks critically at King's flaws. He
does not sugarcoat.3 King's plagiarism of college papers and
sermons, nor his treatment of women, from his well-documented
(thanks to the FBI and other sources) philandering to his less
known anti-feminist attitudes toward women in leadership roles.
Dyson's frankness about King's faults enhances his credibility when
he argues that the ledger sheet for the civil rights leader's life
shows an enormous balance in favor of greatness.
</P>
<P>
   Like its subject, this book is not perfect. In addition to the
weakness in narrative writing, Dyson takes unnecessarily long side
trips into issues such as the origins of communism and the socially
redeeming value of rap music. Though relevant to his discussion,
those subjects should have been covered in a few paragraphs, not
pages.
</P>
<P>
   The book's virtues outweigh its flaws, much as King's
accomplishments are greater than his personal shortcomings. The
scale here isn't tipped toward greatness, but, on balance, Dyson
has produced a work that will be valuable to those who want to
remember the true Martin Luther King Jr.

&HT;     IN THE YEAR 2024, THE ELIAN CASE IS STILL ALIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The following is from a news story of the
future:
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI _ In the latest of a long series of maneuvers that began
in December 1999, the family of 28-year-old Elian Gonzales
announced that he has been chosen as the vice presidential running
mate of Republican presidential candidate Tucker Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel confident that this move will keep Elian in the United
States for at least another two years because the election isn't
even until 2024,'' said Josefina Morales Smith, Elian's great-great
aunt twice-removed. ``And if Elian and Mr. Quayle should win, our
dear, sweet boy can remain here in the land of the free and home of
the brave for at least six years.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle is the son of former Vice President Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   Elian, who is never referred to by his surname because everyone
still thinks of him as ``the little boy who escaped from Cuba,'' is
in his second term as a congressman from his adopted Miami
district.
</P>
<P>
   Once an aide to retired Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., Elian was
encouraged by Burton to join Quayle on the GOP ticket, just as
Burton had encouraged the young Cuban refugee to run for the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since Elian was 6, I have been committed to finding ways
to keep him in the United States,'' said the octogenarian Burton.
</P>
<P>
   ``First time was January 2000 when I subpoenaed the little tyke
to testify before Congress. I bought almost two months with that
ploy _ and that was long enough to get a Miami family court judge
to throw a major wrench into the INS' plan to send the kid back to
his dad in that godforsaken communist hellhole.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, over the years Burton has come up with a variety of
successful schemes to prevent Elian from being sent back to his
native Cuba and reunited with his father, who died in 2014.
</P>
<P>
   With economic and political support from anti-Castro
Cuban-Americans in Miami, the Hoosier congressman managed, among
other things, to spearhead two constitutional amendments, enroll
Elian in Indiana University and, in the boy's senior year, enlist
him in an ROTC program that mandated he serve 18 months in the U.S.
Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a close one, I'll tell you,'' Burton recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were down to the wire with Elian needing only three units
to graduate. I was this close to asking the homecoming queen at
I.U. to accuse him of date rape, just so we could buy some more
time with a trial and _ if necessary _ a conviction. Even a U.S.
prison is better than Castro's Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Elian, Tucker Quayle's mother, Marilyn, came up
with the idea of enrolling the refugee in a mandatory-service ROTC
program. University administrators and Air Force brass were only
too happy to waive the customary two-year ROTC college minimum.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, in Burton's final congressional term, he had little
trouble persuading both the House and Senate to pass constitutional
amendments that lifted the citizenship requirement for
congressional candidates and the age requirement for presidential
and vice presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, non-citizen Elian breezed to victory at age 25 in his
maiden run for office and, at age 28, is Quayle's first choice for
veep.
</P>
<P>
   It is also widely believed that Burton was instrumental in
employing a significant non-political maneuver that helped ensure
Elian would not return to Cuba: He introduced the young man to his
soon-to-be wife, Lourdes Maria Ciccone Leon, the only daughter of
former rock singer Madonna.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the alleged matchmaking, Burton chuckled and
said only: ``Let's just say there came a time when Disney World and
Big Macs were not enough.''
</P>
<P>
   News of Elian's vice presidential candidacy did not go down well
in Havana, where hundreds of mostly gray-haired students took to
the streets in protest. The 95-year-old Fidel Castro, in
characteristically robust health, decried the ``imperialistic
encroachment'' of the United States in Cuban affairs and vowed that
he ``will not rest'' until Elian is returned to his homeland.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie, Steve Murray and Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alaska: Spirit of the Wild'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Narrated by Charlton Heston.
</P>
<P>
   It's big, it's bold, it's big. The sheer size of the latest Imax
offering sometimes makes it an eye-opening experience. Otherwise,
this visit to the far, brrr-cold reaches of our biggest state is
just one of those languid Discovery Channel-style nature flicks.
The film spans millenniums _ and throws in bits and pieces about
Alaskan life. (Bob Longino) 40 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``All About My Mother'' R (profanity, sexuality, drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Cecilia Roth, Marisa Paredes, Penelope Cruz and Antonia
San Juan.
</P>
<P>
   Spain's bad-boy filmmaker Pedro Almodovar grows up with this
humane celebration of nurturing women. ``All About My Mother'' is a
virtually male-free fable with a title inspired by that backstage
classic ``All About Eve.'' It's a movie that can wink at its own
campy sensibility while still grabbing you by the gut. Dark and
tender, the movie beautifully balances humor and heartache. In
Spanish with subtitles. (SM) 1 hour, 41 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' R (strong sexuality, nudity, profanity,
</P>
<P>
   violence and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Spacey
</P>
<P>
   and Annette Bening.
</P>
<P>
   A beaut. The ever-more-remarkable Kevin Spacey leads a stellar
ensemble cast (Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Chris Cooper) in this
scarily disturbing, daringly hilarious comedy-drama in this fin de
siecle tragifarce centering on Spacey as a man caught in a midlife
limbo. The movie is a hauntingly optimistic elegy for America the
Beautifully Screwed Up. (ERG) 1 hour, 58 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Anna and the King'' PG-13 (violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we didn't need another version, but this one is handsome
and engaging. Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat star in this lavish,
songless costume drama that holds its own against the beloved 1956
musical ``The King and I.'' A mix of old-fashioned moviemaking
doused with contemporary political correctness. (SM) 2 hours, 20
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Any Given Sunday'' R (profanity, sexuality and nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Al Pacino, Jamie Foxx
</P>
<P>
   and Cameron Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Stone takes on pro football's dark side _ pills, booze,
prostitutes, shady back-office deals _ and almost fumbles. The
jarring game visuals come at you nonstop. Al Pacino plays the coach
of the fictional Miami Sharks and argues constantly with young team
co-owner Cameron Diaz. Jamie Foxx plays a rising quarterback and
emerges as the best actor in the large cast. (Bob Longino) 2 hours,
50 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Bandits'' R (profanity, sexuality
</P>
<P>
   and some drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Katja Riemann,
</P>
<P>
   Jasmin Tabatabai, Nicolette Krebitz.
</P>
<P>
   Though it pushes too often into fantasy, and works itself into a
corner that can only be solved by a not-great ending, the German
film ``Bandits'' is a peppery, amusing variant of ``Thelma &AMP;
Louise,'' retooled as an MTV video. Jokey and lightweight, it's
everything that German cinema is stereotypically not supposed to
be. In German with subtitles. (SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Being John Malkovich'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Cusack, Cameron Diaz,
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Keener and John Malkovich.
</P>
<P>
   It's a loopy original. John Cusack plays a quirky file clerk who
discovers a door that leads into the noggin of actor John
Malkovich. The movie toys with big concepts _ the nature of
identity, the lust for celebrity, sexual desire that blurs gender
lines, the illusion of free will _ without ever stopping long
enough to state a thesis. It's playfully profound one moment, gonzo
the next. And it's often hysterically funny. (SM) 1 hour, 52
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Bicentennial Man'' PG (profanity and sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robin Williams,
</P>
<P>
   Embeth Davidtz and Sam Neill.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Williams plays the android Andrews, a metallic butler who
slowly develops human traits (creativity, curiosity and a hint of
emotion). But the people around him age, wither, die. Overlong,
``Man'' moves swiftly for its first 90 minutes, but it slows down
to become a disappointingly conventional love story that isn't
really persuasive. The movie has a heart, but a flagging pulse.
(SM) 2 hours, 12 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bone Collector'' R (profanity, violence and grisly images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Denzel Washington
</P>
<P>
   and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Double Jeopardy,'' this crime drama is, at its core, pure
pulp filmmaking. It delivers plenty of sucker punches. But thanks
to the film's two talented stars _ Denzel Washington as a brainy
quadriplegic detective and Angelina Jolie as his equally brainy
forensics cop _ this thriller's got enough electricity to make it
watchable. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 58 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cider House Rules'' PG-13 (sexuality, nudity,
</P>
<P>
   substance abuse, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michael Caine
</P>
<P>
   and Tobey Maguire.
</P>
<P>
   John Irving has adapted his own novel. In the first half, Dr.
Larch (Michael Caine) delivers babies and performs illegal
abortions in his remote Maine orphanage. In the second,
less-engaging half, Larch's protege, parentless Homer Wells (Tobey
Maguire), runs off with a World War II pilot and his girlfriend to
learn about the world. Excellent performances by Caine and by
Delroy Lindo as an apple picker. (ERG) 2 hours, 5 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The End of the Affair'' R (scenes of strong sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ralph Fiennes,
</P>
<P>
   Julianne Moore and Stephen Rea.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Jordan's somber, velvety and often sensual adaptation of
Graham Greene's novel explores love both physical and spiritual.
Considering the difficulty of conveying religious faith in film,
he's surprisingly successful in depicting both kinds of passion.
While the movie doesn't skimp on humid clinches and bared skin, it
also summons up the intangible mysteries of sacrifice and devotion
to a higher power. (SM) 1 hour, 49 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``End of Days'' R (violence and gore, a strong sex scene,
</P>
<P>
   profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger
</P>
<P>
   and Gabriel Byrne.
</P>
<P>
   Bigger than ever, the movies' biggest he-man Arnold
Schwarzenegger leaps into action, going mano a mano with a
beady-eyed Gabriel Byrne as the devil in this explosion-happy
thriller. Awash in often too-dark cinematography and bloated with
bombs, gore and gross-outs, ``Days'' is a movie full of punches but
no spark. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 58 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``Fantasia/2000'' G
</P>
<P>
   Animated. Music from Beethoven
</P>
<P>
   and Stravinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The entirety of this new ``Fantasia'' isn't worth one whirling
mushroom from the 1940 original. The movie lacks the wit, charm,
warmth, humor and awe of its predecessor, underscored by the
inclusion of one old segment, ``The Sorcerer's Apprentice.'' Our
advice: Drop off the kids, shop the mall, then go rent the
original. (ERG) 1 hour, 30 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Galaxy Quest'' PG (mild violence and sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver
</P>
<P>
   and Alan Rickman.
</P>
<P>
   It'll beam you up, up and away. Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver and
Alan Rickman lead a small band of has-been sci-fi TV show actors
lured by misguided aliens into helping them save their far, far
away galaxy from an invasion of evil bug-lizards. Though it starts
slowly, ``Quest's'' completely cornball humor sometimes scores
direct hits. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 42 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Girl, Interrupted'' R (profanity and content relating
</P>
<P>
   to drugs, sexuality and suicide)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Winona Ryder
</P>
<P>
   and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   Two fine actresses, two fine performances. Based on Susanna
Kaysen's memoir about the two years she spent in the '60s at a
mental hospital, the movie goes for a rip-roaring tone reminiscent
of ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.'' As Susanna, Winona Ryder
steadies the movie and gives it its emotional center, but Angelina
Jolie provides the fireworks as a charismatic sociopath. (ERG) 2
hours, 5 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Green Mile'' R (profanity, violence,
</P>
<P>
   sex-related material)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Hanks
</P>
<P>
   and Michael Clarke Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   A manipulative but meticulously crafted, absorbing, beautifully
acted and deeply satisfying adaptation of Stephen King's prison
novel. Tom Hanks plays a 1930s death row guard whose latest
prisoner, a mysterious hulk played by Michael Clarke Duncan, has
mystical powers of healing. ``Mile'' is exactly the sort of package
Oscar voters love. (SM) 3 hours, 2 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hurricane'' R (profanity and some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Denzel Washington
</P>
<P>
   and Vicellous Reon Shannon.
</P>
<P>
   Denzel Washington delivers his best performance in years as
pugilist Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter, the middleweight contender
wrongly imprisoned for nearly 20 years in a triple murder. Though
ably directed, the film contains some fabrications _ and invents
one key character, a Javert-like detective _ to tell this otherwise
compelling true story. (Bob Longino) 2 hours, 5 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Liberty Heights'' R (profanity and sex-related material)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Joe Mantegna,
</P>
<P>
   Adrien Brody and Ben Foster.
</P>
<P>
   Warmed-over chicken soup. Barry Levinson's movie about coming of
age in a Jewish neighborhood in 1950s Baltimore is generally
well-acted and sometimes evocative. His anecdotal reminiscences
concerning the Kurtzman brothers don't convey much that's fresh or
surprising. But Joe Mantegna delivers an unexpected dignity and a
nuanced self-knowledge as the boys' numbers-running father. (ERG) 2
hours. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Magnolia'' R (profanity, drug use, sexuality, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jason Robards Jr.,
</P>
<P>
   Julianne Moore, Tom Cruise
</P>
<P>
   and William H. Macy.
</P>
<P>
   A mesmerizing tapestry about broken families, love and
forgiveness. Unfolding at fever pitch and studded with small
miracles of acting, writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson's
``Magnolia'' is exhilarating and exhausting, the sort of movie you
live through as much as watch. The payoff is well worth it. Among
the stellar acting talents: Tom Cruise, Jason Robards Jr. and
Julianne Moore. (SM) 2 hours, 59 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Man on the Moon'' R (profanity, sexuality and nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jim Carrey,
</P>
<P>
   Danny DeVito and Paul Giamatti.
</P>
<P>
   A dizzying look at the mind of comic genius Andy Kaufman, capped
by Jim Carrey's spectacular performance. Carrey's impersonation of
the late, prankish Kaufman, a performer as interested in making
people squirm as making them laugh, is often so pitch-perfect, it's
more like channeling than acting. The movie's title comes from an
R.E.M. song about the comic, and the Athens band wrote the movie's
score. (SM) 1 hour, 58 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Mansfield Park'' PG-13 (brief violent images,
</P>
<P>
   sexual content, drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Frances O'Connor,
</P>
<P>
   Jonny Lee Miller and Harold Pinter.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Rozema's take on Jane Austen's third novel adds dollops
of lesbianism, feminism and social consciousness to Austen's
19th-century tale of Fanny Price (Frances O'Connor), a poor girl
shipped off to live with her wealthy relatives at Mansfield Park.
Rozema extrapolates bits of Austen's journals into Fanny's own
writing, melding character and author. Rozema didn't seem to trust
her material. (ERG) 1 hour, 52 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Mysteries of Egypt'' Unrated.
</P>
<P>
   Featuring Omar Sharif
</P>
<P>
   and Kate Maberly.
</P>
<P>
   National Geographic's bigger-than-life Imax film offers many
breathtaking views of Egypt's natural and man-made wonders. There
is ample footage of giant pyramids, huge statues and redwood-tall
columns, all frequently displayed from ground view with a seemingly
you-are-there feel. Warning: Some of the narration is pure hokum.
(Bob Longino) 40 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Next Friday'' R (profanity, drug use, sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Ice Cube and Mike Epps.
</P>
<P>
   A dumb comedy. The best that can be said for this sequel to
``Friday'' is that, unlike the first flick, the characters don't
spend most of the movie sitting on the front steps yacking and
getting stoned. They go elsewhere to get stoned. Lamely written,
it's a reminder that, while complex, mature and funny
African-American comedies are being made, there's always a market
for flatulence and dog poop jokes. (SM) 1 hour, 33 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Sense'' PG-13 (intense thematic material
</P>
<P>
   and violent images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette.
</P>
<P>
   A surprising, spine-tingling gem. Eight-year-old Cole (Haley
Joel Osment) can see ghosts, not the Casper variety but restless
phantoms with their skulls blown open. It's a fascinating, odd film
that speculates on what the relationship between the restless dead
and a liaison to the living world might be. Plus, this film has the
best, and loveliest, last-act twist of the year. (SM) 1 hour, 47
minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Sleepy Hollow'' R (violence and gore,
</P>
<P>
   a scene of sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci
</P>
<P>
   and Miranda Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Heads up: Tim Burton is back. His latest is a blend of scary
swordplay, witchcraft and self-spoofing humor served with tongue
planted firmly in cheek. Johnny Depp is effective as Ichabod Crane,
who's sent to investigate a series of beheadings in 1799 Sleepy
Hollow. The movie's comic relief balances the Headless Horseman's
single-minded attacks, which spare neither men, women nor children.
(SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Snow Falling on Cedars'' PG-13 (profanity, disturbing images,
</P>
<P>
   sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ethan Hawke,Youki Kudoh
</P>
<P>
   and Max von Sydow.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty but chilly. Based on the best seller, Ethan Hawke plays a
newspaperman looking into slaying charges against a
Japanese-American. The case rekindles memories of internment during
World War II and Hawke's youthful romance with the suspect's wife.
Beautifully photographed to mask its thin plot, ``Cedars''
generates little passion and, frankly, is flatline drama. (SM) 2
hours, 6 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Straight Story'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Richard Farnsworth
</P>
<P>
   and Sissy Spacek.
</P>
<P>
   David Lynch shifts gears in this lyrically simple little film
based on the true story of 70-plus Alvin Straight (Richard
Farnsworth), who drove his John Deere riding mower more than 300
miles to reconcile with his brother (Harry Dean Stanton). It's a
sublime celebration of America at its most beautiful: kind,
welcoming, gloriously eccentric. (ERG) 1 hour, 41 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Stuart Little'' PG (brief profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Geena Davis, Jonathan Lipnicki
</P>
<P>
   and the voice of Michael J. Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Based very loosely on E.B. White's 1945 children's book, Stuart
is a 3-inch-tall computer-animated wonder voiced by Michael J. Fox.
He brushes his teeth, gargles and aw-shucks smiles with such
convincing visuals you'll swear he's the next best critter since
``Babe.'' But his movie, at first charming and angelic, turns into
run-of-the-mill slapstick. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 33 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' R (violence, profanity, brief
nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matt Damon, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow and Cate
Blanchett.
</P>
<P>
   A handsome adaptation of novelist Patricia Highsmith's twisty
thriller. Matt Damon plays the title character, who travels to
Italy to bring back a rich man's son but ends up adopting his
lifestyle and committing murder. Fans of the earlier, superior
adaptation ``Purple Noon'' will likely find this lovely-to-look-at,
but psychologically flawed, version disappointing. (SM) 2 hours, 18
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Toy Story 2'' G
</P>
<P>
   Computer animation
</P>
<P>
   featuring the voices of Tom Hanks,
</P>
<P>
   Tim Allen and Joan Cusack.
</P>
<P>
   More rock 'em, sock 'em fun than families have seen in years.
Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and old and new
characters are locked in a delightful story of toy rustling and
what it means to love a child. With its inspired, hilarious script,
a heartfelt new song (``When She Loved Me'') and downright stunning
visuals, ``Toy Story 2'' isn't just better than ``Cats,'' it's
better than ``Toy Story.'' (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 25 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Tumbleweeds'' PG-13 (profanity, sensuality
</P>
<P>
   and a scene of domestic discord)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Janet McTeer
</P>
<P>
   and Kimberly J. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Give this one a tumble. Janet McTeer and Kimberly J. Brown are
generating Oscar buzz for their sensational performances in this
funny, heartfelt film. McTeer is a sassy Southerner with a talent
for finding the wrong men. Brown is her savvy adolescent daughter
who knows her mom's hit-and-run tactics all too well. A more real,
affecting work than ``Anywhere But Here.'' (ERG) 1 hour, 40
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Is Not Enough'' PG-13 (violence, sexuality and
innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Pierce Brosnan,
</P>
<P>
   Sophie Marceau and Robert Carlyle.
</P>
<P>
   This 19th James Bond movie is more of the same old same old.
Bond is assigned by M (Judi Dench) to protect an heiress (Sophie
Marceau) and her oil pipeline from a nut-case terrorist (Robert
Carlyle). There's the usual eye-popping opening stunt sequence.
It's as if everyone involved knew how to make a Bond movie, but
they were thinking about something else at the time. (ERG) 2 hours,
8 minutes. C-

 &HT;    Searching out the true story of Jesus Christ
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Jan. 16.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For two millennia, a single man has been at the center of all
that has become Western civilization _ its expansion across Europe
and into the Americas, its conflicts as much as its conquests, its
moral code and its most deeply held beliefs. The pre-eminence of
Jesus Christ is taken for granted, even apart from the reverence of
the faithful. In writing of Abraham Lincoln, for example, it is
customary to note that only Christ has been the subject of more
books, more scholarship, more study.
</P>
<P>
   None of those books is so widely read or so frequently quoted as
the Bible, the latter part of which deals with the life and work of
Jesus. The irony is that so little should be known about either the
life or the man. As the biblical scholar Paula Fredriksen writes in
``Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews: A Jewish Life and the
Emergence of Christianity,'' ``The single most solid fact about
Jesus' life is his death: he was executed by the Roman prefect
Pilate, on or around Passover, in the manner Rome reserved
particularly for political insurrectionists, namely, crucifixion.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that we have ... what? The easy certitude of Sunday
pulpiteers, the ready reference to Scripture and its inerrant
authority, the vague heritage of tradition. And so we speak with
assurance of ``what Jesus meant,'' when there is precious little we
know about the man _ when, in fact, his own followers seem not to
have been sure what he meant.
</P>
<P>
   A part of Fredriksen's thesis is that the Gospels cannot easily
be gospel when they tell conflicting stories, both in chronological
detail and narrative emphasis. Most Christians would settle on
Jesus as Redeemer, Lord, Messiah and Son of God _ a transcendent
figure, in other words. But any or all of these come at no cost;
faith may be hard-won, but it is free for the asking.
</P>
<P>
   Establishing the historical Jesus imposes greater demands.
Pressed to be more specific (and lacking evidence), lay Christians
are apt to see the Jesus they want to see: prophet and teacher,
healer and exorcist, herald of apocalypse, religious martyr, even
political insurrectionist. There is a Jesus for every Christian,
and fragments of proof (chapter and verse, as we say) are drawn
from a Bible whose most obvious feature is not consistency.
</P>
<P>
   Delving into a detective story
</P>
<P>
   Fredriksen is painstakingly clear in all of this. Professor of
Scripture at Boston University and the author of ``From Jesus to
Christ: The Origins of New Testament Images of Jesus,'' she wants
to answer a question she thinks central to the genesis of
Christianity: Why was Jesus killed? And why, if Jesus was a threat
to the priests of the temple or even the Roman authorities, were
his followers not also executed?
</P>
<P>
   Fredriksen's search for an answer is almost a detective story,
as labyrinthine as the catacombs themselves but refreshingly
independent of dogma and cant. ``Though the word is unfashionable
in academic history right now,'' she says, ``I shall breathe it
anyway, here: We have facts. Facts about Jesus, and facts about the
movement that formed after his crucifixion. Facts are always
subject to interpretation _ that's part of the fun _ but they also
exist as fixed points in our investigation. Any explanation, any
reconstruction of Jesus' mission and message must speak adequately
to what we know to have been the case.''
</P>
<P>
   It would rob the reader of some of that fun (and do Fredriksen
an injustice) by blurting out an answer, especially one that is
neither simple nor easily arrived at. But a hint will do: Read the
Gospel of John again. Read it carefully. Note how it conflicts with
the Gospel of Mark, which, as Fredriksen shows, was almost
certainly the basis for the Gospels of Matthew and Luke.
</P>
<P>
   Connection between religion, politics
</P>
<P>
   In the life and death of Jesus, religion and politics were
inevitably intertwined. ``Pilate,'' Fredriksen writes, ``would have
known little and cared less about Jewish religious beliefs and
intra-Jewish religious controversy.'' But he understood crowd
control, and the necessity of dispersing dissent. The last time
Jesus came to Jerusalem, crowds were hostile. Pilate's concern was
not that of the priests of the temple. Theirs was religious, his
civil. The two could find common ground in a common nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   Pilate knew who Jesus was, but had no reason to care about his
disciples. ``This datum alone, from all other traditions the
Gospels offer,'' Fredriksen writes, ``can explain the core
historical anomaly of the Passion stories: Jesus was crucified, but
his followers were not.''
</P>
<P>
   What is lost to time and forgetfulness is that Jesus never
called himself a Christian, for the simple reason that his mission
and message did not extend beyond his own subjugated people. He
preached in the prophetic tradition, and might have been included
among the true prophets of Israel had not St. Paul and others taken
liberties with his word. It is a delicate point, but only in
retrospect. ``As it was,'' the historian Herbert J. Muller wrote in
the '50s, ``Jesus was crucified as the King of the Jews; on the
cross he appealed to the God of the Jews. He died, as he had lived,
a devout Jew.''

 &HT;    German `Bandits' take to the road on the run in jailbreak tour
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though it pushes too often into fantasy and works itself into a
corner that can be solved only by a not-great ending, ``Bandits''
is a peppery, amusing variant of ``Thelma &AMP; Louise,'' retooled as
an MTV video.
</P>
<P>
   German director Katja von Garnier, working from an idea she
hatched with Atlanta writer-director Ben Taylor (``In the Flesh''),
gives us a tale of four tough women prisoners who form a band
behind bars. Making an unexpected jailbreak, they drive across
Germany hoping to make it to a ship that will carry them to South
America. Staging impromptu concerts at nightclubs, signing
autographs for star-struck fans and taking the cutest boy in the
bar (Werner Schreyer) hostage when police close in, the gals become
folk heroes, with a hit record and money in their pockets.
</P>
<P>
   The fun times start to slip away, though, when both the sullen
Luna (Jasmin Tabatabai) and delicate Angel (Nicolette Krebitz) fall
for the same guy. Meanwhile, a determined detective (Hannes
Jaenicke) is hot on their trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bandits'' is a cheerfully implausible adventure that you don't
believe for a minute. But, like some of the fair-to-decent songs
the stars sing, it has a good beat. It's jokey and lightweight, and
everything that German cinema is stereotypically not supposed to
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bandits''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Katja Riemann, Jasmin Tabatabai and Nicolette Krebitz.
Rated R for profanity, sexuality and drug use. In German, with
subtitles. Through Thursday at Cinefest (Georgia State University).
$3, $5 after 6 p.m. 404-651-2463. 1 hour, 49 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A gender-bent prison-break rock 'n' roll fantasy.

 &HT;    In-your-face `Interrupted' a gripping tale of disturbed kids
acted with Oscar-worthy skill
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Angelina Jolie interrupts ``Girl, Interrupted'' like a great
rude shout.
</P>
<P>
   As Lisa, a charismatic sociopath who befriends the film's
heroine, she's a mad, bad girl, so simultaneously fierce and
flippant that she can make ordering a hot fudge sundae an act of
aggression.
</P>
<P>
   Jolie provides the fireworks, but producer-star Winona Ryder
gives the film its steadying, heartfelt center. The actress snapped
up the rights to Susanna Kaysen's 1993 memoir of her two-year stint
in an upscale psychiatric hospital in the late 1960s. But it took
her almost six years to find a suitable director. She hit pay dirt
with James Mangold (``Heavy,'' ``Copland''), who eschews the
genre's potential touchy-feely pitfalls and opts for a rip-roaring
tone more akin to ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.'' (Jolie is
already being called ``a female Jack Nicholson.'')
</P>
<P>
   Not that you don't see teddy bears and girls in fluffy slippers,
but there's something unexpectedly unsettling about ``Girl,
Interrupted.'' It puts you on edge.
</P>
<P>
   Ambushed by her parents and a ``family friend'' therapist who
talks to her for about 20 minutes, 18-year-old Susanna (Ryder)
signs herself into Claymoore, only to find that most of the
patients aren't quiet little sensitive-depressives like her. Aside
from the flamboyant Lisa, there's Polly (Elisabeth Moss), who's
burned off half her face; Daisy (Brittany Murphy), who's addicted
to laxatives, chicken and Daddy; and Georgina (Clea Duvall), a
compulsive liar with a ``Wizard of Oz'' fixation. Compared with
them, Susanna seems positively sane _ except that she chased a
bottle of aspirin with a bottle of vodka because ``I had a
headache.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Girl, Interrupted'' leans a little too heavily on the '60s
dictum that only the crazy are sane. And a last-act confrontation
is as superfluous as it is over the top. But overall, the movie is
a wonderful surprise, especially for those expecting a kind of
women-as-victims update of ``The Snake Pit.''
</P>
<P>
   These kids definitely aren't all right, and the movie is careful
to show them as individuals, not just as cultural detritus that
doesn't fit in. Mangold reinforces this aspect with a strong cast
of authority figures: Vanessa Redgrave, once an icon of madness
(``The Loves of Isadora''), as the imposing yet sympathetic head
therapist; Jeffrey Tambor as a superficially foolish yet genuinely
caring doctor; and Whoopi Goldberg, who may look like a cross
between Angela Davis and Buddha in her '60s Afro and serape but who
understands Susanna better than anyone else, telling her, ``You're
a lazy, self-indulgent little girl who's driving herself crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jolie is likely to make the most noise around Oscar nomination
time. Her role is a built-in showcase, but to her credit, she does
many daring and unexpected things with it. It would be too bad,
however, if Ryder were overlooked. So many of her previous
performances have depended on her natural camera-ready fragility.
But here she seems in charge of that vulnerability, using it in a
shrewdly nuanced portrayal that's the best work she's ever done.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are she won't make the Oscar short list, but sometimes,
acting well is its own reward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girl, Interrupted''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie. Directed by James
Mangold. Rated R for strong language and content relating to drugs,
sexuality and suicide.
</P>
<P>
   At metro theaters. 2 hours,
</P>
<P>
   5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Two fine actresses, two fine performances.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar prospects:
</P>
<P>
   Jolie is a good bet for a best supporting actress nomination;
Ryder a long shot for best actress.

&HT;     MEMBER OF SEMINAL ROCK GROUP SURVIVES BOUT WITH CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOODSTOCK, N.Y. _ Levon Helm was doing what he does best,
leading the band from what he calls the best seat in the house, the
drummer's stool, belting out song after song. But something wasn't
right. The charismatic kid from Arkansas didn't sound like himself.
</P>
<P>
   Helm, best known for his music with the seminal '60s and '70s
Woodstock-based rock group called simply The Band, felt his voice
growing more and more hoarse. This was two and a half years ago.
</P>
<P>
   When he went to a blues benefit in Tunica, Miss., a couple days
later, hoarse would have been an improvement. Nothing came out. Not
a word, just a rasp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's that secret little spot back there in your
mind where you know something's wrong, but you don't want to admit
it,'' Helm said. ``You put it off, you know. But my family and
friends made me go to the doctor, and that's when you start dealing
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The diagnosis was grim but not fatal. Helm was found to have
cancer, a malignant growth on his vocal chords that required a
series of 25 radiation treatments at Memorial Sloan Kettering
Hospital. The last radiation session was late summer 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen months later the soulful voice that belted out ``The
Night They Drove Old Dixie Down'' and other classics for The Band
(which was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994) is
a raspy, faint version of what it once was.
</P>
<P>
   But Helm, 57, is reinvigorated as a musician. His latest band,
Levon Helm and the Barn Burners, featuring his 29-year-old
daughter, Amy, as well as Chris O'Leary, last year enjoyed a
five-month stint in New Orleans and in December started playing
weekly Wednesday night gigs at Joyous Lake in Woodstock.
</P>
<P>
   When Helm was found to have cancer, Amy returned from Manhattan
to be at his side. She regularly drove him to the clinic in
Tarrytown, in Westchester County, where he received his radiation
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``He completely inspired me and kept me cool because of how
blindly courageous and strong he was,'' Amy recalled. ``It really
transformed our relationship, turned it into what I would call a
huge gift.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about linking arms with someone and going
deep into that fear and hell that makes you just laugh and
celebrate and feel a different joy, which I'm entirely grateful
for,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Levon Helm remembers it somewhat differently, that Amy was his
pillar, and not the reverse. ``It was a scary damn thing. My family
helped me, my daughter helped me a lot. You hate to cry and take on
in front of your kids. That don't look right.''
</P>
<P>
   Now they make music together, Levon leading the band from the
best seat in the house, Amy singing the blues.
</P>
<P>
   She divides her time between a studio apartment on the Upper
East Side in Manhattan, where she works in a florist's shop, and
Woodstock, where her mother, Libby Titus, and her father and
stepmother, Sandra Dodd Helm, all live.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Helm, for the time being and possibly forever, does not
sing. He can't. His voice won't let him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's fine,'' said Helm, who has a recording studio in a barn
on his Woodstock property. ``I never wanted to be a singer anyway.
All I ever wanted is to be a drummer.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing at Joyous Lake, a gritty roadhouse on Woodstock's main
drag, on the last Wednesday in December, Helm wears a boyish grin
as the band knocks out blues standards. His brown hair is thinning
and a lighter color than it was a quarter-century ago, his cheeks
and chin no longer covered with facial hair. Garth Hudson, his
buddy, colleague and Woodstock neighbor for more than 30 years, is
sitting in on the synthesizer.
</P>
<P>
   Helm seems blessed with an uncanny ability to land on his feet.
When The Band initially broke up following a farewell performance
on Thanksgiving Day 1976, a star-studded concert that Academy
Award-winning director Martin Scorsese turned into the acclaimed
feature-length film ``The Last Waltz,'' Hollywood came a knockin'.
</P>
<P>
   He made his debut as Loretta Lynn's father in 1978 in ``Coal
Miner's Daughter,'' and has appeared in about a dozen more movies,
including ``The Right Stuff,'' in which he played Maj. Jack Ridley,
Gen. Chuck Yeager's sidekick. His most recent role was in the 1997
Stephen Seagal action flick, ``Fire Down Below.''
</P>
<P>
   Helm also has written a memoir, ``This Wheel's On Fire,''
published in 1993. He and co-author Stephen Davis met during the
past month to begin making plans to add a new final chapter to the
book, one which will reflect on the December death of Helm's good
friend and longtime fellow musician, Rick Danko.
</P>
<P>
   The addition to the memoir will also discuss Helm's battle with
cancer, which he only recently began talking about publicly. He
feels blessed to have survived his ordeal, sings hosannas to the
caretakers at Sloan Kettering whenever he gets the opportunity, and
hopes that by sharing his story it might help someone else who gets
a life-threatening diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   The one lifestyle change Helm is acutely aware of is quitting
cigarettes. A three-packs-of-Marlboros-a-day habit ended when the
doctors found cancer on his vocal chords.
</P>

   ``They don't know what causes cancer, but smoking doesn't
help,'' explained Helm, who frequently says ``yessir'' or ``no
sir'' when responding to questions. ``I've thought about it some. I
think coughing is one of the worst things that happens to you, and
the cigarettes make it worse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize until about six months after I quit how much
those damn things were robbing me, no matter how good they are. I
don't know what they put in those things because they sure are
good,'' he said. ``But I have so much more breath now. Now when
someone tells a joke I can laugh instead of cough.''

   For Amy, this is her first time playing regularly with her
famous father. She grew up around his music, though, and believes
that he's playing better than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone's got to document what's happening. There are these
amazing nuances and subtleties to his drumming now,'' she said. ``I
watch him play and my jaw just drops to the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like he's beating out all the stuff he couldn't talk
about. I think his drumming has become his voice and he is playing
the hell out of it,'' she said. ``It just makes me smile ear to
ear.''

   HOLOCAUST _ LONDON _ Maverick historical writer David Irving was
accused in court Thursday of fabricating an order from Adolf Hitler
calling for a halt to mass murders of Jews in 1941 _ a key element
in his argument that the Nazi leader was initially opposed to the
genocide. Irving wrote in his 1977 book ``Hitler's War'' that he
had discovered ``incontrovertible evidence'' that Hitler had
ordered that there would be ``no liquidation'' of Jews. However,
Irving acknowledged in court that he based this assertion on a
misreading of a handwritten note from Gestapo Chief Heinrich
Himmler. Instead of demanding the end of the killing of all Jews,
Himmler's note suggests he spared one trainload of 1,000 Jews
transported Berlin to Riga in Latvia. (Roughton, Cox News Service).

   CUBABOY _ MIAMI _ Even if lawyers for relatives of Elian
Gonzalez get their day in federal court, legal experts are doubtful
a judge would rule that the 6-year-old Cuban rafter should remain
in the United States. As they prepare to file suit in federal court
next week, it appears the relatives' strategy may be to try to
stall Elian's return until Congress convenes Jan. 24 in hopes of
quick passive of a bill granting the boy citizenship _ even though
President Clinton probably would not sign it. Meanwhile, Attorney
General Janet Reno said Thursday the boy should be returned quickly
so ``he can get on with his life.'' (Williams, Cox News Service).

   COLLEGE-ESSAYS _ AUSTIN, Texas _ For admissions officers at
colleges and universities across the country, the next six to seven
weeks areis crunch time, akin to a tax preparer's workload before
April 15 or a sales associate's long hours before Christmas. It's a
particularly intense kind of work. How do admissions officials stay
fresh? How do they make sure they're evaluating candidates each
candidate fairly, and not discriminating against a student because
he or she had the bad luck to be the 50th file they've read that
week, after a long day? (Santos, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED

CONVERTIBLES AND THEIR SIREN CALL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a day when winter blinked.
</P>
<P>
   Three days into the New Year, air warm and sun glistening, she
passed me on the interstate. The top on her Saab convertible was
down and she had a scarf on her head, sunglasses wrapped across her
eyes, as she bopped to music I could not hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thelma or Louise?,'' I asked myself.
</P>
<P>
   And that got me to thinking about convertibles.
</P>
<P>
   Remembering how they had symbolized different things down the
years: panache, elegance, escape, the freedom of the open road.
</P>
<P>
   They'd evolved from the elegant days of Delahayes, Duesenbergs,
and Packards to the hot droptops of the 1950s, the T-Bird and the
'Vette, the big Lincoln and Cadillac ragtops. In the 1970s, they
virtually disappeared from showrooms.  &UR; Today &LR; , they are making a
big comeback, particularly as Miata-inspired roadsters.
</P>
<P>
   When I got home, I picked up a book, ``The Convertible,'' by Ken
Vose (Chronicle Books, San Francisco; www.chronbooks.com) and
through words and pictures followed his ode to the convertible as
it captured romance, rumble, and revival.
</P>
<P>
   Vose subtitled his book ``An Illustrated History of a Dream
Machine'' and one of the first images you see when you open it is a
shot of Cary Grant and Grace Kelly sitting in a Sunbeam Alpine,
heads in the Mediterranean sun, looking down on Monte Carlo. It's a
shot from the Hitchcock flick, ``To Catch a Thief.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere you find shots of other actresses and actors who added
to the romance of the ragtop: George Maharis and Martin Milner
beside the Corvette in which they roamed ``Route 66''; Susan
Sarandon and Geena Davis _ ``Thelma and Louise'' _ in front of
their '66 T-Bird; and Jack Nicholson and Shirley MacLean in the
'Vette that symbolized his fight against middle-age angst in
``Terms of Endearment.''
</P>
<P>
   The images all speak to one essential of the convertible.
</P>
<P>
   Vose writes: ``Driving a convertible means more than just
freedom of movement. It's also the freedom to enjoy the great
outdoors on an equal footing with the richest of the rich. Put the
top down on your beat-up-mobile, and the sun on your face is
identical to that shining on the guy over there in the Lamborghini
Diablo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ain't that America?,'' in the words of singer John Mellencamp.
</P>
<P>
   Think early convertible and you think 1936 Cord Supercharged
Convertible Coupe. Or, as Vose points out, the elegance of Clark
Gable as manifested in his fine fleet: a 1932 Packard Twin Six, a
1934 Packard Twelve LeBaron, a Rollston-bodied 1934 Duesenberg J, a
1938 Packard Darrin Convertible Victoria, a 1946 Lincoln
Continental, a 1940 Jaguar XK120, and a 1957 Mercedes 300 Sc
cabriolet.
</P>
<P>
   Vose gives us hot rods like the classic 1932 Ford Roadster, and
he gives us James Dean, alive and dead, in his Porsche 356 with the
words ``Little Bastard'' painted on its rear engine cover.
</P>
<P>
   The '50s were a heady time for the convertible and its
popularity rolled into the 1960s when pony cars got droptops, the
Volkswagen Bug took off, and convertible sales hit half a million
by 1965. By 1969, Vose reports, they had dropped to 200,000, and in
1976 the last Cadillac Eldorado convertible _ the only domestic
droptop being built at the time _ rolled off the line.
</P>
<P>
   Were we bored with ourselves, had we lost our sense of
adventure, were we too self-conscious? Did air conditioning and the
fuel crisis help kill the convertible? It seems the '70s, with an
essence of counterculture, should have been a good decade for the
convertible.
</P>
<P>
   Vose quotes Peter Marsh and Peter Collett from their book
``Driving Passion'': ``Convertibles communicate their own
distinctive messages. For many people they evoke not only the true
spirit of motoring, but also a sense of youthful freedom and
nonconformity.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the '70s, nonconformists drove Volkswagen vans and
slant-six Valiants, not convertibles.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the heady '80s, which showed, as Vose writes, ``the
convertible was not dead, it had just gone into hiding, waiting for
a more favorable economic and political environment.''
</P>
<P>
   So Lee Iaccoca, who gave us the minivan, also brought back the
convertible with the Chrysler LeBaron. By the end of the decade,
the Mazda Miata had come ashore and its advent meant the return of
the real two-seat sports roadster. Were it not for the Miata, we
might not  &UR; today &LR;  have the BMW Z3, Porsche Boxster, Mercedes SLK,
Dodge Viper, Plymouth Prowler, or upcoming Audi TT roadster.
</P>
<P>
   Saab's got a droptop and so does Volvo. They seem to be
everywhere again.
</P>
<P>
   You see them driven by young and old, men and women, all out
there in the sun and the wind in a way you cannot be in an enclosed
box. Possibility seems boundless, adventure endless.
</P>
<P>
   It's what convertibles are all about, even on a warm faux fall
day that comes upon us in early January.
</P>
<P>
   Vose captures this essence very well when he quotes an old
British Leyland ad extolling the essence of the Triumph TR-7.
</P>
<P>
   It reads: ``Headroom: 93 million miles.''
</P>
<P>
   So here's to convertibles, to unexpected warm days, and to the
woman in the Saab _ Thelma or Louise _ and many miles in open cars
on open roads.

VW EUROVAN SHORT ON FEATURES, BIG ON PRICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember when Arlo Guthrie took a ``half-ton of garbage, put it
in the back of a red VW microbus, took shovels and rakes and
implements of destruction'' and headed out for his Thanksgiving
encounter over littering with the fearsome Officer Obie?
</P>
<P>
   You could do the same with the new 2000 Volkswagen EuroVan GLS,
but there's a hitch: Arlo didn't pay $33,750 for the VW van he
drove in ``Alice's Restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   And that price is my problem with the new EuroVan, descendant of
the old microbus, but more closely descended from the EuroVans of
1980-91, rectangular boxes with 90 horsepower engines.
</P>
<P>
   The folks at VW call the EuroVans ``highly versatile vans for
the adventuresome,'' and say the GLS is ``well equipped.''
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, do I feel as if I'm driving a delivery van as I sit
high in the seat and listen to the roar of the motor seep into the
cab?
</P>
<P>
   At almost $34,000 I'd expect firm leather seats (heated, at
that), double sliding doors (a trend in vans these days), and, hey,
even a glove compartment or a big storage console between the front
seats.
</P>
<P>
   What you get is soft fabric seats that dip at the thigh, no
glove compartment, no console. Storage is limited to slots in the
front doors and sidewalls in the rear. Vans are meant for journeys,
and spartan doesn't work here.
</P>
<P>
   I think that what Volkswagen is offering in the EuroVan is a
base on which to build a camper _ you can add a pop-up roof with a
two-person bed, window screens, a refrigerator, a second battery,
and a two-burner LP gas stove.
</P>
<P>
   But $33,750 is too high a price to pay for a base on which you
build your camper. And as a van in competition with far more
luxurious offerings _ say the Honda Odyssey 5-door with a
navigation system at $28,000, or offerings from Toyota, Mazda,
Ford, and Chevrolet _ the EuroVan is just not plush enough.
</P>
<P>
   And that's too bad, because there are things about the van that
are admirable.
</P>
<P>
   Its 2.8-liter, VR6 engine _ two overhead cams, two-valves per
cylinder, 140 horsepower, 18.4 miles per gallon in a week of
driving _ makes it a virtual rocket in its class. Straight ahead on
hilly country roads or on highways, it's got all the power you
need.
</P>
<P>
   But you can hear that power coming back at you through the
firewall _ and if you happen to have your wipers set on
intermittent, the loud clicks they make with each movement are like
an annoying metronome set to a background rumble.
</P>
<P>
   It's got great heat _ remember the old VW buses with that tiny
metal chimney that rose from floor to dash and heated nothing? _
but the defroster doesn't cover the windshield to its edges.
</P>
<P>
   The EuroVan is front-wheel drive, and a standard low-speed
traction control system should help make it a good winter vehicle.
The ride is fairly smooth on its four-wheel independent suspension,
rack-and-pinion steering is crisp, and ABS-assisted four-wheel disc
brakes bring it to quick stops.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a very tall box and the suspension that gives it a
comfortable straight-ahead ride can't compensate for that high
center of gravity. Occupants are at the mercy of strong lateral
forces in turns.
</P>
<P>
   If you suddenly come upon a sharp turn at a good speed, the feel
of the steering wheel does not instill confidence as you roll into
the turn, and I had the sensations of both oversteer and understeer
at various times.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, it's got a rigid, rugged body, and safety
features include dual front airbags and side impact beams in the
doors.
</P>
<P>
   Standard equipment includes power door locks, cruise control, a
6-speaker AM-FM radio with cassette player, heated windshield
washer nozzles, power outside mirrors, and a four-speed automatic
transmission.
</P>
<P>
   Zoned climate control for the rear is a nice touch, as are
focused reading lights that let passengers read without interfering
with the driver's vision.
</P>
<P>
   The rear cargo area, with roll-up cover, seems cavernous, though
a brighter light for finding gear at night would be nice. But,
because the van is so tall, I'm not sure how a short person _ say
under 5-foot-4 _ would close the heavy rear hatch once it has been
opened; it swings well up and out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a Volkswagen fan. The Golf, New Beetle, Jetta, and Passat
are all wonderful cars sold at good prices.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen is a company broadening its offerings, from
high-powered Beetles to a 12-cylinder luxury sedan, and it is
cutting edge in much of what it already offers.
</P>
<P>
   But with the EuroVan, it's a company behind the times in terms
of passenger comfort and convenience. If they want to sell campers,
they should just build them fully loaded and sell them as such.
</P>
<P>
   If they want to sell a minivan, they should design and build one
_ and not try to pass off a stripped-down camper as a comfortable
family van.
</P>
<P>
   And by the way, at a base price of $31,300, I don't feel I
should have paid for the power sunroof ($1,000 option), heated
front seats ($400 option), and metallic paint ($275 extra).
</P>
<P>
   But at least you get a full-size spare tire.
</P>
<P>
   Nice Touches:
</P>
<P>
   --The $275 extra is annoying, but the Black Magic Metallic paint
is liquidly beautiful. Looks as if you could dip a finger in it.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --The radio, center dash, is too low. You must take your eyes
off the road to see what you are doing down there.
</P>
<P>
   --Even worse, the cup holders sit on the floor. You're high in
the driver's seat, and if you reach for bottle or cup, you have to
bend so far your head may be below the dash.
</P>

   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (``i'' code)
</P>

   HARRODS-PHILIP (London) _ Buckingham Palace announced that it
was withdrawing one of its Royal Warrants from Harrods, which held
it for 40 years. The store must remove Prince Philip's crest from
the front of the store, stationery and other products by the end of
the year. A palace spokesman sought to quash rumors that the move
was due to irritation at the claims of Harrods' owner, Mohammed
al-Fayed, that Prince Philip was behind the death of Diana, the
Princess of Wales and his son Dodi. By Warren Hoge.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL GENERAL &LR;  (``a'' code)
</P>
<P>
   ILL-BOY-SENTENCE (Pontiac, Mich.) _ A family court judge
Thursday sentenced 13-year-old convicted murderer Nathaniel Abraham
to a juvenile center until he is 21, a more lenient sentence than
prosecutors had wanted. Abraham was one of the youngest murder
defendants in the United States when he was convicted Nov. 16 of
shooting a stranger in the head with a rifle outside of a
convenience store. (Summary from wires) By Keith Bradsher.

</P>
<P>
   IOWA-OUTLOOK (Perry, Iowa) _ Over the years, the Iowa caucuses
have made some presidential candidates (like Jimmy Carter) and
unmade others (like Edward M. Kennedy). But this time, they have
seemed like a sideshow, and a poorly attended one at that, to the
main event in New Hampshire. That may be changing. With only 10
days left until Feb. 24, when tens of thousands of Iowans will
assemble in living rooms, clubs and school halls to declare their
preferences, two well-funded, well-organized underdogs, Bill
Bradley and Steve Forbes, have accelerated their efforts. If not to
defeat their respective rivals, Al Gore and George W. Bush, they
hope to come very close _- close enough to give them a lift as they
move to New Hampshire, whose critical primary takes place only
eight days later on Feb. 1. By R.W. Apple Jr.
</P>

   BUSH-FATHER (Atlantic, Iowa) _ For the first time in the

   INTERNET-INVEST (Undated) _ For almost a year, Internet
companies have gotten a sweet ride from investors, public and
private, willing to accept enormous losses on the promise of great
future returns. But there were some signs last week that the

 &HT;    `Friday' enough to make you wish for Monday
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sorry, folks, but it looks like the end-of-the-year season of
prestige films is officially winding down. Now it's back to the
usual garbage. Example A: ``Next Friday,'' from producer,
co-scripter and star Ice Cube. It's not opening next Friday, but
today.
</P>
<P>
   The best that can be said for this sequel to the 1995 comedy
``Friday'' is that, unlike the first flick, the characters don't
spend most of the movie sitting on the front steps and yakking
while they get stoned. No, they go to other interesting locations
to get stoned. Like a record shop. And a suburban house. That's
where Craig (Cube) goes to stay with his lottery-winning uncle when
the thug he trashed in the first movie, Debo (Tommy ``Tiny'' Lister
Jr.) breaks out of jail and comes looking for him.
</P>
<P>
   This change of scenery doesn't do much to alter the movie's
tired vision of all its women characters as psychopaths or sluts.
Craig's uncle's wife (Kym E. Whitley) is always trying to stick her
tongue in his ear, while his cousin Day-Day (one-time Atlantan Mike
Epps) is on the run from two ex-girlfriends who stalk him with
pepper spray and vandalize his car.
</P>
<P>
   The one exception to cartoonish portrayal is Karla (Lisa
Rodriguez), but she fits another movie stereotype. She's the
standard-issue good girl with voluptuous curves who inexplicably
falls hard when she gets an eyeful of the single, sullen facial
expression Cube uses from first frame to last. In a fantasy scene,
Karla writhes seductively for him, standing on a coffee table. One
assumes that is an auteuristic reference to the star's directorial
work on the gritty and powerful expose of the world of exotic
dancers, ``The Players Club.'' Yeah, whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Karla lives next door to Craig's uncle with her three
drug-dealing brothers, led by the tough little tattooed one named
Joker (Jacob Vargas). The guys give the movie an excuse to revel in
cliched jokes about Latino machismo. They also raise the T&AMP;A
quotient by holding a party and inviting three beauties, who each
wear about three square inches of clothing. Oh, the Joker Bros.
also have some high-powered firearms, so a lot of things get shot
up for fun at the film's climax. Did I mention their fierce little
pit bull, who turns out to enjoy getting stoned, too?
</P>
<P>
   Too lamely written to ever be really offensive, ``Next Friday''
is a reminder that, while more complex, mature but still funny
African-American comedies are getting made (``The Wood,'' say, and
``The Best Man''), there's always a market for flatulence and dog
poop jokes. Hey, nothing wrong with that. But the flick could use
Chris Tucker, co-star of the first ``Friday,'' AWOL in the sequel.
He probably took a look at the script and realized this sequel was
no reason to shout, ``T.G.I.F.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Next Friday''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: D+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ice Cube and Mike Epps. Rated R for strong language,
drug use and sexual content. 1 hour, 33 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: It's back to business as usual at the movies, with
the return of this typical dumb comedy.

   PERIOD-ROOMS (New York) _ Period rooms. Loosely defined, we all
live in them, don't we? Any one of our current abodes might be a
period room of tomorrow, a specimen of the as yet uncrystallized
turn-of-the-21st-century period style. But of course, loose is not
what's under discussion here. For an authentic period room you have
to leave your own fledgling interior and visit a major museum; in
New York this means going to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the
Brooklyn Museum of Art. With roughly 80 period rooms between them,
they represent the greatest concentration to be found in any
American city. By Roberta Smith.

   NEW-YORK-LIGHT (New York) _ Two years ago, Joe, the man I lived
with, suggested that we outfit our apartment with a light
especially created to combat the winter blues. Seasonal affective
disorder is its quaint moniker. I vetoed the proposal. What I
wanted was not to sit under 10,000 lux of white light to trick my
brain into believing it was spring. I wanted us to soak up the real
stuff, the unadorned light of the New York Harbor at sunset, say,
or the slow illumination of the city on a Sunday morning. Joe isn't
here anymore. He went hiking up a mountain one day last summer. It
is believed that he slipped and fell in the woods. Bloodhounds and
rescue teams were sent for him. But the forest is so dark and
dense, his body is yet to be found. This winter, with unusual
deliberation, I have taken to soaking up the light alone, or mostly
alone. I troll for outings that promise birds and sunsets on
Jamaica Bay in Queens. I bundle up for lunchtime sprints around
Bryant Park in Manhattan to watch how the windows of the library
spit out the sun's reflection. Unwittingly I have turned into a
student of light. The August light that envelopes the beaten-down
old streets of Red Hook, I have learned, is more melancholy than
the morning light during lilac season in the Brooklyn Botanic
Garden. The sun sparkling on the crown of the Chrysler building is
whimsical, like a woman dressed for a party at high noon. By Somini

MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. ON LIST OF PROPOSED CATHOLIC MARTYRS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., the Southern Baptist minister,
civil rights leader and inspirational orator, is a leading
candidate to be declared a martyr by the Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   King, who would have celebrated his 71st birthday on Saturday,
would be an unusual choice for martyrdom for several reasons,
according to scholars . He was not Catholic, he was killed not
while preaching but while advocating for labor rights and his
personal life has been the subject of some debate in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But the US Catholic bishops have included King among a list of
two dozen Americans to be considered by the Vatican for a list of
20th Century martyrs that Pope John Paul II plans to unveil on May
7.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martin Luther King, whom I held in great personal esteem, is
somebody who was in many ways a charismatic figure and a prophet in
terms of civil rights,'' said Bishop Tod Brown of the Diocese of
Orange County in Southern California. ``His whole rationale had a
strong spiritual basis, and he immediately came to mind when we
started thinking about citizens of this country. I am hoping his
name will go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown headed the martyr nomination process for the United States
bishops, who wound up forwarding about two dozen names for
consideration to the Vatican. In all, the Vatican received about
9,000 nominations worldwide for inclusion on the list of martyrs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the pope wants to do is, during this jubilee year, in
some way to honor men and women from the 20th century who have died
because of their faith,'' said Paul Henderson, executive director
of the Jubilee Year 2000 office at the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The list of nominees is not public, but most are likely to be
victims of totalitarian regimes, such as Nazi Germany and various
countries allied with the Soviet Union, or political violence,
particularly in Latin America. One of the nominees is expected to
be Archbishop Oscar Romero of San Salvador, who was murdered while
saying Mass in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The list of American nominees is small because few Americans
have been killed for their faith in this century. Among the
American nominees are four churchwomen who were murdered in El
Salvador in 1980, in killings that Representative J. Joseph
Moakley, the South Boston Democrat, used to criticize US policy
toward Central America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Undoubtedly, history will remember the 20th century as a time
of persecutions _ an era of martyrs,'' Bishop Michael Hrynchyshyn,
the chairman of the Vatican's new martyrs commission, said last
fall.
</P>
<P>
   The early church frequently issued lists of martyrs in the first
several centuries after the death of Jesus, starting with the first
one, St. Stephen, an early Christian leader who was stoned to
death. But lists of martyrs, once essentially a compilation of
those honored by local communities, have become less common as the
Vatican has asserted more authority over the process of honoring
exemplary Christians, including naming some as saints.
</P>
<P>
   In the modern era, the Vatican has named only Roman Catholics as
saints. Martyrdom has traditionally been one of the main paths to
sainthood, but this year's list of new martyrs is to include
non-Catholics who probably will not be considered for canonization
as saints.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something absolutely new,'' said Lawrence Cunningham,
a a professor of theology at Notre Dame. ``The pope is aware of the
fact that it wasn't only Catholics that went to concentration camps
or Siberia, and he thinks it's only fair to make a list of all
Christians that died for the faith. He says he does not want these
people to be forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts said that naming non-Catholic martyrs carries great
symbolic importance as the Catholic Church reaches out to other
Christian denominations. King's very name _ Martin Luther _ is that
of the German theologian whose criticism of the church in the 16th
century led to the Protestant Reformation.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the pope to recognize Protestant martyrs is a very
important ecumenical move,'' said Daniel Boyarin, a professor at
the University of California at Berkeley and author of the new
book, ``Dying for God: Martyrdom and the Making of Christianity and
Judaism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was only a few centuries ago,'' Boyarin said, ``when
Catholics and Protestants were burning each other at the stake.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, King is an obvious choice for special Vatican
recognition, some scholars said. He was a religious leader who was
inspired by his faith to work for social justice and who was killed
for his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always thought that ultimately the cause of social justice
related back to the Old Testament's prophets,'' said Clayborne
Carson, a history professor at Stanford University and the editor
of King's papers. ``His notion of his jeremiad was rooted in the
Old Testament notions, that the purpose of Christian faith was to
be a corrective in society and to challenge society.''
</P>
<P>
   Although a committed Baptist, King was ecumenical in his work.
He met with Pope John XXIII and attended many meetings with leaders
of other faiths, and spoke often of the importance of brotherhood.
Catholics, in turn, were often active in his civil rights marches.
</P>
<P>
   ``As early as the 1970s, people were asking: `Why can't
Catholics venerate Martin Luther King Jr.?' '' said Maureen Tilley,
a religious studies professor at the University of Dayton who has
written about martyrs. ``Martin Luther King, if he shows up on the
list, will show up as a martyr. . . for taking the message of Jesus
and seeing how it applied to a very concrete situation where his
aim was not primarily political but religious or humanitarian.''
</P>
<P>
   King's personal life has been questioned in recent years. Among
others, the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, a King confidant, said King had
had an affair with a Kentucky lawmaker, and the lawmaker later
acknowledged having had a relationship with King.
</P>
<P>
   Tilley said that King's personal life could be an issue at the
Vatican, but that others with blemished lives have been honored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Catholics believe Mary Magdalene was a saint, and the legend
is that she was a prostitute,'' Tilley said. ``There's always a
chance of someone being a martyr for the faith after a pretty
dissolute life, but that always complicates holding the person up
as a martyr.''
</P>
<P>
   King repeatedly urged people not to see him as a saint, but
since his death he has been frequently seen as a kind of prophet,
according to Gerald Platt, a sociologist at the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst who writes about King's image.
</P>
<P>
   ``People frequently make associations between him and people
like Christ and Moses, people who've led others out of tyranny,''
Platt said
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, in outlining his goals for the year 2000,
John Paul spelled out his intention to issue a list of new martyrs
who need not be Catholic, and who would not be subject to the
lengthy and grueling examination that attends formal canonization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church of the first millennium was born of the blood of
the martyrs,'' John Paul wrote. ``At the end of the second
millennium, the church has once again become a church of martyrs.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope made clear his ecumenical intentions, saying ``the
witness to Christ borne even to the shedding of blood has become a
common inheritance of Catholics, Orthodox, Anglicans and
Protestants,'' and called for compiling a new martyrology, saying:
``As far as possible, their witness should not be lost to the
church.''
</P>
<P>
   Martyrdom has a long history in Christianity, and martyrs are
looked upon as role models and objects of veneration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be difficult to overestimate the importance of
martyrs in the Catholic tradition,'' said the Rev. Harvey Egan, a
Boston College theologian. ``Since Jesus died a violent, bloody
death reviled as a common criminal, to die for faith was viewed by
Christians as the supreme way to imitate Christ.''

   FRENCH-NEW-YORK (New York) _ The minimum requirement for Le
Weekend New Yorkais was about as basic as a crusty baguette. My
French husband and I yearned for a Manhattan with a Gallic accent _
a bistro perhaps where a petit caniche begs for sugar cubes below a
polished bar, or a brasserie where the mood is casual, the air is
more smoke than oxygen and the frites are served with mustard and
the songs of Serge Gainsbourg. By Doreen Carvajal.

   &UR; FOR FRIDAY AMs &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Friday, Jan. 14:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (``i'' code)
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA (Argun, Russia) _ Russians struggle to reassert
control in a city they held, then lost to rebels and have now
recaptured. The Russian commander was killed by rebels. By Michael
R. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   With map.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-SYRIA (Jerusalem) _ In a draft Israel-Syria peace plan
that stakes out initial positions, Israel wants to keep settlers on
Golan Heights. Also, visiting U.S. senators talks with Prime
Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   With map.
</P>
<P>
   U.N.-AFRICA (United Nations) _ The Security Council is to
discuss problems of refugees in Africa. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   HARRODS-PHILIP (London) _ Buckingham Palace announced that it
was withdrawing one of its Royal Warrants from Harrods, which held
it for 40 years. The store must remove Prince Philip's crest from
the front of the store, stationery and other products by the end of
the year. A palace spokesman sought to quash rumors that the move
was due to irritation at the claims of Harrods' owner, Mohammed
al-Fayed, that Prince Philip was behind the death of Diana, the
Princess of Wales and his son Dodi. By Warren Hoge.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL GENERAL &LR;  (``a'' code)
</P>
<P>
   ILL-BOY-SENTENCE (Pontiac, Mich.) _ A family court judge
Thursday sentenced 13-year-old convicted murderer Nathaniel Abraham
to a juvenile center until he is 21, a more lenient sentence than
prosecutors had wanted. Abraham was one of the youngest murder
defendants in the United States when he was convicted Nov. 16 of
shooting a stranger in the head with a rifle outside of a
convenience store. (Summary from wires) By Keith Bradsher.
</P>
<P>
   CUBAN-BOY (Miami) _ Developments in the Elian Gonzalez situation
By Peter T. Kilbron.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POLITICS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   IOWA-OUTLOOK (Perry, Iowa) _ Over the years, the Iowa caucuses
have made some presidential candidates (like Jimmy Carter) and
unmade others (like Edward M. Kennedy). But this time, they have
seemed like a sideshow, and a poorly attended one at that, to the
main event in New Hampshire. That may be changing. With only 10
days left until Feb. 24, when tens of thousands of Iowans will
assemble in living rooms, clubs and school halls to declare their
preferences, two well-funded, well-organized underdogs, Bill
Bradley and Steve Forbes, have accelerated their efforts. If not to
defeat their respective rivals, Al Gore and George W. Bush, they
hope to come very close _- close enough to give them a lift as they
move to New Hampshire, whose critical primary takes place only
eight days later on Feb. 1. By R.W. Apple Jr.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-FATHER (Atlantic, Iowa) _ For the first time in the
campaign, former President Bush stumps for his son. By B. Drummond
Ayres Jr.

   INTERNET-INVEST (Undated) _ For almost a year, Internet
companies have gotten a sweet ride from investors, public and
private, willing to accept enormous losses on the promise of great
future returns. But there were some signs last week that the
climate of unlimited forgiveness may be changing and that dot.coms
_ particularly those that cater to consumers _ are suddenly feeling

 &HT;    ANALYSIS: MEDIA CONVERGENCE: IS IT THE NEXT GREAT THING?
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, Jan. 16.
 &HT;    Eds: This article stands for the weekly GLASS-COLUMN.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ You pick up the phone, and instead of a dial tone
you hear a friendly female voice purr: ``How may I help you?''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than punching the keypad, you say: ``Let me talk to my
wife.'' Or you might ask for some stock quotes or a ball score. At
your request, the service could even brief you on the top news
stories of the day, reporting first and at more length on topics it
knows interest you most.
</P>
<P>
   In such ways, VoiceTone, a technology now being tested by AT&AMP;T
Labs, could transform your familiar phone into a versatile
information appliance. In some parts of Europe and the Far East,
similar services are already available through wireless phones and
tiny screens linked at high transmission speeds to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming decade, AT&AMP;T executives foresee the integration of
wired and wireless telephones, television sets, personal computers
and the Internet into one seamless content-driven entity.
Facilitating such convergence is the fact that AT&AMP;T has recently
transformed itself into the nation's largest cable system.
</P>
<P>
   Similar ``unitary information pipe'' thinking prevails at AOL
Time Warner, the huge media combine pieced together last week. Time
Warner ranks as No. 2 in the cable business, while AOL leads the
U.S. market in providing Internet access to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This overused word of convergence is, in fact, about to
happen,'' Gerald Levin, now Time Warner's chairman and chief
executive officer, said in a post-merger interview.
</P>
<P>
   When Levin's new partner, AOL's Steve Case, was asked whether
all that coming convergence was necessarily a good thing, he
replied: ``Oh, it's a great thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Case added: ``Consumers love the fact they (will) have new ways
to get information, new ways to communicate, new ways to buy
products, new ways to learn things, new ways to be entertained. ...
They're empowered to do what they want, when they want, the way
they want.''
</P>
<P>
   So what will happen when 21st century media takes over? Does the
advent of interactive AOL-TV, which would let viewers communicate
over the Internet even as they watch their favorite shows, signal
the fall of plain old television as we've known it for the last 50
years? And what about newspapers, magazines and books?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to see some deaths,'' predicts Kurt Andersen, the
founder of Spy magazine and editor of New York magazine.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Andersen observes, television didn't put an
end to radio, although it eclipsed it in many ways. While someday
we're likely to see ``peaceful coexistence,'' until that day
arrives, ``a lot of limbs (will) die on the media tree.''
</P>
<P>
   Putting the Internet on TV and TV on the Internet doesn't mean
that the traditional broadcast networks will soon vanish or that
most people will prefer to watch shows on their digital computer
monitors, even though it will easy to do so.
</P>
<P>
   But with Internet traffic doubling roughly every six to nine
months, such giant media concerns as AT&AMP;T and AOL Time Warner,
among others, will press to make faster advanced gear more readily
available. Widespread broadband access, in turn, promises to
radically alter the way many users now relate to cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our kids will think about things like communications
very differently than we do,'' says Steve Perlman, the co-founder
of Web-TV, currently owned by Microsoft, the software giant that
both competes with and does lots of business with AOL.
</P>
<P>
   Concludes Perlman: ``They're going to look at a telephone as a
strange thing where you had to remember a number to reach somebody.
What a dumb way to communicate. It's much better to communicate in
some IP (Internet protocol) way, whether it's voice or video.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as the AT&AMP;T lady might put: ``How may I help you?''

information appliance. In some parts of Europe and the Far East,
similar services are already available through wireless phones and
tiny screens linked at high transmission speeds to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming decade, AT&AMP;T executives foresee the integration of
wired and wireless telephones, television sets, personal computers
and the Internet into one seamless content-driven entity.
Facilitating such convergence is the fact that AT&AMP;T has recently
transformed itself into the nation's largest cable system.
</P>
<P>
   Similar ``unitary information pipe'' thinking prevails at AOL
Time Warner, the huge media combine pieced together last week. Time
Warner ranks as No. 2 in the cable business, while AOL leads the
U.S. market in providing Internet access to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This overused word of convergence is, in fact, about to
happen,'' Gerald Levin, now Time Warner's chairman and chief
executive officer, said in a post-merger interview.
</P>
<P>
   When Levin's new partner, AOL's Steve Case, was asked whether
all that coming convergence was necessarily a good thing, he
replied: ``Oh, it's a great thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Case added: ``Consumers love the fact they (will) have new ways
to get information, new ways to communicate, new ways to buy
products, new ways to learn things, new ways to be entertained. ...
They're empowered to do what they want, when they want, the way
they want.''
</P>
<P>
   So what will happen when 21st century media takes over? Does the
advent of interactive AOL-TV, which would let viewers communicate
over the Internet even as they watch their favorite shows, signal
the fall of plain old television as we've known it for the last 50
years? And what about newspapers, magazines and books?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to see some deaths,'' predicts Kurt Andersen, the
founder of Spy magazine and editor of New York magazine.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Andersen observes, television didn't put an
end to radio, although it eclipsed it in many ways. While someday
we're likely to see ``peaceful coexistence,'' until that day
arrives, ``a lot of limbs (will) die on the media tree.''
</P>
<P>
   Putting the Internet on TV and TV on the Internet doesn't mean
that the traditional broadcast networks will soon vanish or that
most people will prefer to watch shows on their digital computer
monitors, even though it will easy to do so.
</P>
<P>
   But with Internet traffic doubling roughly every six to nine
months, such giant media concerns as AT&AMP;T and AOL Time Warner,
among others, will press to make faster advanced gear more readily
available. Widespread broadband access, in turn, promises to
radically alter the way many users now relate to cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our kids will think about things like communications
very differently than we do,'' says Steve Perlman, the co-founder
of Web-TV, currently owned by Microsoft, the software giant that
both competes with and does lots of business with AOL.
</P>
<P>
   Concludes Perlman: ``They're going to look at a telephone as a
strange thing where you had to remember a number to reach somebody.
What a dumb way to communicate. It's much better to communicate in
some IP (Internet protocol) way, whether it's voice or video.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as the AT&AMP;T lady might put: ``How may I help you?''

&HT;     TIM ROTH TURNS TO DIRECTING IN `THE WAR ZONE' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By LOUIS B. PARKS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first call to Tim Roth about his movie ``The War Zone''
didn't work out. Bad timing.
</P>
<P>
   Roth was at a Pasadena, Calif., playground with two of his sons,
trying to hook the youngest into a child's swing. Juggling the cell
phone on his shoulder made it tougher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hold on one more second; we're having swing issues here,''
Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   In the background there was child-sized laughter. Daddy doing an
interview wasn't the kids' problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife is sick, and so I ran from school down to have a
picnic, and (the interview) completely slipped my mind,'' Roth
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Should we try again later? ``That'd be great,'' he said. ``One
of them will be napping.''
</P>
<P>
   As an actor, Roth has a busy career playing offbeat supporting
roles, mostly gritty low-lifes with an attitude. He's a favorite of
filmmaker Quentin Tarantino.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Pulp Fiction,'' Roth was the petty thief Pumpkin. With his
girlfriend, Honey Bunny, he tried to rob a diner, only to run into
gun totting Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Rob Roy,'' Roth was a wicked, foppish villain who raped the
character played by Jessica Lange. He was so memorably evil he got
an Oscar nomination.
</P>
<P>
   He was more sympathetic in last year's ``The Legend of 1900,''
starring as a pianist who lived his whole life on an ocean liner.
</P>
<P>
   But Roth sometimes gets weary of acting, and he started looking
for a film to direct. That led to ``The War Zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Which may lead to a new career, because ``The War Zone,''
opening Friday, is a devastating film experience, not soon to be
forgotten. It is a serious, sober and unflinching view of incest
and sexual child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   It was not what Roth expected to be shooting, but when he read
the novel he quickly accepted the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something that couldn't be denied,'' Roth said. ``I've
been around victims all my life. It's a subject I know. I was glad
that it came to me rather than somebody who didn't know the
subject.''
</P>
<P>
   Roth said he has been close to several victims of sexual abuse
and that he believes it is far more common than most people know.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only have the people we've caught, or the people who have
spoken about their abuse,'' Roth said. ``Mostly it's not going to
get reported.
</P>
<P>
   My opinion, and it's purely my opinion, is that it's highly
epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on a novel by Alexander Stuart, who also did the
screenplay, ``The War Zone'' is about a seemingly normal English
family.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which is not rated, is especially troubling due to
the realistic, objective approach Roth takes to the material. He
keeps the camera still most of the time _ rather than cutting
frequently to different angles and faces _ drawing us into the
family life with its everyday chit-chat and, later, uncomfortable
silences.
</P>
<P>
   The film is anything but glamorous or titillating: the one
scene, late in the movie, in which the audience sees incestuous
sex, is shot from a distance and fairly dark. But it is still
brutal to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Because Roth takes a long time developing his characters into
real, seemingly likable people, it seems as if we are exposed to
much more.
</P>
<P>
   Some viewers have walked out of screenings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been accused of being exploitive,'' Roth said. ``Merely
out for titillation, uh, what else? Pornographic, abusive ... I
really don't know (why). If someone sees it as an abusive film, I
kind of worry about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to show this is what it feels like. This is what they
do, and this is how it feels.''
</P>
<P>
   Roth believes the movie can be informative to young people, but
he says parents should definitely see the movie before they decide
whether to allow children to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told my oldest son he can't see it. He's 15. This would
be one of his first sexual experiences. I don't want that to be the
case.''
</P>
<P>
   Making the movie even more disturbing is how nice everyone is,
even the father _ the abuser of the film's family. It was a hard
role for actor Ray Winstone. He almost left the project midshoot
because he couldn't handle the sexual scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very scared,'' Roth said. ``But we created a tight
family around him, and he got through it. There were times I
thought we were going to lose him _ or I was going to lose some of
the crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awful. (The first part of the movie) created a tight
family, and they didn't want to see their family destroyed in this
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I love about Ray, he didn't understand what this
character was about _ how can we? _ he was just going on his
instincts that it was something that should be told.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day came when he had to be (this side of) this man, which
we had kind of separated from the man he was playing in the rest of
the film.
</P>
<P>
   It was a very tough day for him. But Lara (Belmont, who plays
his daughter) got him through it. And we all got him through it.
And they all got us through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Roth did a long search for the right young people to play the
children of the family, an 18-year-old girl and a 15-year-old boy.
He finally selected two nonactors, Belmont and Freddie Cunliffe,
because he didn't want viewers to think of them as stars of some TV
show. And he wanted their acting to be raw, not slick.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are young and have been trained in some kind of
manner are bringing with them a lot of (junk) that's been taught to
them,'' he said, adding, ``If I taught Lara and Freddie (junk),
it's the kind of (junk) I like.''
</P>
<P>
   Roth said he cleared the script with the young actors' parents,
got them agents and kept counselors on the set.
</P>
<P>
   Roth has been pleased with most of the early response to ``The
War Zone,'' especially with people who talk to him afterward about
their own experiences with abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have spoken to people who have never spoken about it before
who have started talking because of having seen the film,'' Roth
said. ``That's been a wonderful experience.''

&HT;     BAMBOLEO: A MUSICAL JOURNEY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MICHAEL D. CLARK  
 &HT;     c.2000 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Bamboleo represents all that is right with the
progression of Afro-Cuban dance music in America.
</P>
<P>
   Right up until a young Cuban boy is found in the waters off
Miami. A survivor of an escape from Cuba that took his mother's
life, the child is at the center of a controversy that has set off
new rounds of anti-Castro protests in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Bamboleo _ a timba ensemble of young musicians visiting the
United States to promote its new album, ``Ya No Hace Falta'' (I
Don't Need You Anymore), _ is forced into the role of political
ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   For a brief time the group experiences what it's like to be
``them'' to the United States' ``us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The band doesn't really like to take questions about
politics,'' says Angelica Sepulveda, a manager at Ahi-Nama Records,
the record label that promotes Bamboleo and other Cuban bands in
the States. ``They won't even discuss that little boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Maslon, owner of Ahi-Nama, puts it more succinctly. ``They
resent that they have to be asked. My groups are not political.''
</P>
<P>
   The episode is a minor blip that might make Bamboleo's visa
process more difficult in the short term and require more security
for the band in cities with anti-Cuba factions. It is not enough,
however, to stop the infiltration of the island's music into the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   After 40 years of embargo, contemporary timba, rumba and salsa
artists are anxious for a new audience. The spoils of two years of
a Latin-music renaissance in the United States are finally starting
to be felt.
</P>
<P>
   It started with the international acclaim for Buena Vista Social
Club's album of ``son,'' traditional Cuban folk music. Since then,
Mexican-born rocker Carlos Santana has put out ``Supernatural,'' an
album of Afro-Latin grooves recognized with 10 Grammy nominations.
</P>
<P>
   In between, there's been a glitzy pop bonanza of new stars such
as Jennifer Lopez, Ricky Martin and Enrique Iglesias. The next wave
should be a combination of old and new.
</P>
<P>
   Young Latin artists no longer have to ``Americanize'' their
sound to gain international recognition. Groups like Bamboleo and
Ahi-Nama label-mate Arte Mixto could be leading the way toward a
more cultural representation of Cuba's roots.
</P>
<P>
   If Bamboleo's 12-member assault of timba and Cuban ``clave''
draws well at Houston's Club Tropicana on Jan.18, expect it to be
the first in a line of Cuban bands to play in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to keep bringing these bands as long as it's
affordable,'' say Luis Ricardo, co-promoter of Houston's Bamboleo
show. ``I hope this is the start of a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   By day Ricardo is not a concert promoter. He's an insurance
broker.
</P>
<P>
   His partner, Juan R. Duran, owns a barber shop in Houston. Both
are Cuban natives. Ricardo is a percussionist who plays several
nights a week in a local salsa band, Batacha.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Ricardo saw Bamboleo while visiting Cuba and
immediately had thoughts about bringing the group to Houston. After
meeting Maslon last year at an Arte Mixto concert in New Orleans,
he found his opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always thought there was a definite market for this in
Houston,'' Ricardo says. ``If this works, there'll be more Ahi-Nama
bands coming here.''
</P>
<P>
   Timba music is an upbeat, fusion-enhanced, electrified version
of the traditional Cuban ``son'' that many now associate with Buena
Vista Social Club, which performs here Feb. 15 at Jones Hall.
Bomboleo is an even higher-energy departure. Translated, leader
Lazaro Valdes says, the band's name means ``movement,'' and the
band certainly doesn't lack that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, it's a fusion of different rhythms _ rumba,
hip-hop, Latin bop and jazz,'' Valdes says. ``All the groups that
do timba have a pattern that they follow. We take it further with
improvisations, mambos, percussion effect and style.''
</P>
<P>
   The members range in ages from 25 to 35 and are graduates from
the National School of Arts in Havana. Its base in Cuban music
can't be ignored, but songs like ``Circulame'' and ``Yo No Me
Parezco a Nadie'' also have roots in such '70s funk as Earth Wind &AMP;
Fire and the Commodores.
</P>
<P>
   The fashions of Valdes and the four vocalists _ Alejandro
Borrero, Jorge David Rodriguez, Yordamis Megret and Vannia Borges
Hernandez _ are that of a very elegant Latin soap opera. The men
wear Italian suits in black and burgundy; they accessorize with
gold chains and leather shoes.
</P>
<P>
   The women wear luxurious evening gowns and trademark hair so
short it looks painted on their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Around Cuba, young women have taken to the hairdo the way
American teens took to the platform sneakers worn by the Spice
Girls a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   After touring Europe with Los Van Van and Celia Cruz, Bambeleo
has gathered a following in France, Germany and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   In the States, though, it's often like starting from the
beginning, with politics constantly playing a role in the band's
success. Getting visas is easier with every visit, but the band has
experienced instances when shows were delayed or canceled because
of customs.
</P>
<P>
   One can't help but think that contemporary Cuban music will
continue to find its way onto U.S. soil _ first through Miami, New
York and Los Angeles. After that, who knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big honor to come to the United States and share Cuban
music as it is today,'' Valdes says. ``But it's only the beginning.
Our objective is to conquer the world with our sound.''
</P>
<P>
   This week Houston; tomorrow the world.

&HT;     WNBA CHAMPION COMETS: TRIUMPH OVER TRAGEDY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BRUCE WESTBROOK  
 &HT;     c.2000 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   `HEARTS OF CHAMPIONS'
</P>
<P>
   For the Houston Comets, 1999 was a wrenching ordeal capped by an
incredible triumph. This video _ whose complete title is ``Hearts
of Champions: The Official WNBA Championship Video'' _ ably
captures how a dedicated team overcame adversity and responded with
heroism.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the setbacks, of course, was the illness of Kim
Perrot, the team's fiery emotional leader who succumbed to cancer
just days before the playoffs began.
</P>
<P>
   But her impact remained, as perhaps it always will.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence is everywhere. Take the night that Comets star Cynthia
Cooper learned her close friend was nearing the end. Cooper took
the court and scored 42 points.
</P>
<P>
   As the narration puts it, ``Though their hearts were broken,
their spirits were not.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the 47-minute video traces the story with overly
familiar clips and sound bites as the Comets march to their third
consecutive crown.
</P>
<P>
   But it also offers rare glimpses behind the scenes. Most
intriguing are moments when Sheryl Swoopes is heard intensely going
over strategy with her teammates during pauses in the action.
</P>
<P>
   Regular-season highlights are minimal; most of the focus is on
the playoffs _ in carefully edited form.
</P>
<P>
   This is, after all, a product of NBA Entertainment, which wants
to project the best image possible.
</P>
<P>
   Due to that, the video ignores how heated the Comets'
first-round battle with the Los Angeles Sparks became, with
ejections and L.A.'s Lisa Leslie jabbing at the Comets' Tina
Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the finals against the New York Liberty were marked
by opponents embracing each other in support and unity.
</P>
<P>
   With superb camera angles _ including a vantage directly above
the basket _ highlights include Teresa Weatherspoon's remarkable
half-court shot to steal a win at the end of Game 2. That's
followed by the Comets' determined title-clinching performance and
a moving celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The tape ends with a sassy music video by the Houston group
Destiny's Child for ``Jumpin' Jumpin','' followed by a memorial
tribute.
</P>
<P>
   A photo of Perrot is shown with her name and the years of her
life. She may not have played for the Comets in 1999, but she was
as much a part of that season as anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 4 stars.
</P>
<P>
   1999, not rated, USA Home Entertainment, VHS $19.95, no DVD
</P>
<P>
   `LAKE PLACID'
</P>
<P>
   This spry horror comedy rises above convention with sharp
dialogue and lively, earnest performances.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing from ``Jaws,'' the script is by TV wonder boy David E.
Kelley, who sets a massive crocodile to chomping on cattle and
humans in a lovely Maine lake.
</P>
<P>
   Bridget Fonda plays the fish out of water _ a paleontologist
from New York _ with Bill Pullman as the nice-guy game warden who
catches her eye.
</P>
<P>
   But Oliver Platt owns the film as an obsessive inheritance-brat
who stalks crocs with near-spiritual zeal. Sparking much crisp
verbal sparring, he makes this monster mash sing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lake Placid'' ripples with other fun flourishes, from Betty
White as a grumpy granny who treats crocs as pets to a surprising
forest dance party to the tune of Tom Jones' ``It's Not Unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Grisly scenes are quick, brief and amusingly appalling, in the
vein of ``Mars Attacks.'' The 30-foot croc is a marvel of
computer-generated trickery, wisely hidden for most of the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of which, half of this film amounts to little more than
half an hour. ``Lake Placid'' runs 78 minutes without end credits.

   `MYSTERY MEN'
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to ``Lake Placid,'' ``Mystery Men'' doesn't leave us
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Its sweet but thin premise is stretched over a story that runs
two hours.
</P>
<P>
   William H. Macy, Ben Stiller, Hank Azaria and Janeane Garofalo
are among superhero wannabes in a fantasy city where Capt. Amazing
(Greg Kinnear) is top dog _ and dog is the word.
</P>
<P>
   As the vain, money-grabbing, image-obsessed hero, Kinnear is a
hoot. But his underdog rivals with no superpowers _ ``Blue Raja''
Azaria hurls forks, while ``Shoveler'' Macy wields shovels _ aren't
so much lovable losers as they are pathetic nerds given to empty
theatrics.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Rush plays Casanova Frankenstein, a villain whose
character and powers are as murky as his German accent.
</P>
<P>
   Most often, ``Mystery Men'' plays as a parody of the ``Batman''
films. One problem: The last two ``Batman'' films already were
parodies. Again, the Shoveler and company suffer from upstaging.

</P>
<P>
   Adam Rifkin is a promising young director. (He helmed the ``The
Chase'' as well as the agreeably twisted ``Psycho Cop Returns.'')
But the adventures of four randy, rowdy teens as they go to a Kiss
concert in 1978 plays like a poor man's ``Dazed and Confused,''
saddled with preposterous plotting and incessant belligerence, with
severe beatings played as comedy. Avoid.

&HT;     RESEARCHERS SEE DNA AS PATH TO GREATER COMPUTING POWER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Scientists are creating microscoping chemical
``computers'' from DNA that they hope can solve unusually
frustrating types of mathematical problems.
</P>
<P>
   The research is difficult, partly because it involves a
radically new way of storing computer data in the four-letter
chemical code of DNA, rather than in the ``binary'' code of 0s and
1s used in present-day computers' magnetic memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``A gram of DNA might hold up to one quintillion bytes of data.
It's vastly more compact than our most compact conventional media
on computers,'' said John Reif, director of the Consortium of
Biomolecular Computing at Duke University in Durham, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   With funds from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
and National Science Foundation, Reif's center is backing research
on DNA computing at numerous institutions from coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are trying to solve elementary mathematical problems
using millions of DNA molecules, which are either floating in test
tubes or scattered on a small gold chip like blades of grass on a
freshly cut lawn. The latest developments in the field are reported
in Thursday's issue of Nature, the British science journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``A computer in which the (DNA) strands are attached to the
surface of a chip can now solve difficult problems quite quickly,''
researchers Mitsunori Ogihara and Animesh Ray write in an
editorial, ``DNA Computing on a Chip,'' which appears in the same
issue. They were not connected with the actual research finding.
</P>
<P>
   DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid, which is the chemical
basis of the genes that transmit hereditary traits. DNA are the
coiled molecules that decide whether a living organism becomes a
person or a petunia, a possum or a peanut.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, DNA computers would be what computer jockeys call
``massively parallel'' _ the equivalent of millions or billions of
micro-size computers working simultaneously on different aspects of
the same problem. Although much slower than ordinary
metal-and-silicon computers, such computers could prove ideal for
tackling the kinds of problems that are notorious for gobbling
large amounts of computer power.
</P>
<P>
   An example is what is known as a traveling salesman problem, in
which a company must pick a salesman's optimum route through
numerous cities _ that is, the cheapest, fastest route that
requires the least duplication of effort. There are more up-to-date
applications, such as an airline trying to select ideal routes for
stopover flights between airports.
</P>
<P>
   But even leading experts caution that the future of DNA
computing is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually don't think it would have any market unless it is
clearly superior to (alternative computer systems). ... This is a
field in its infancy,'' said Lloyd M. Smith, a chemistry professor
at the University of Wisconsin at Madison and the co-author of the
research paper in Nature. For now, at least, ``this is actually one
of the least practical projects I work on.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS. &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The article by Qinghua Liu, Smith and four other scientists
points out that the field of DNA computing was invented in 1994 by
Leonard Adleman of the University of Southern California. Using DNA
in test tubes that encoded mathematical information on their
molecular structures, Adleman solved a so-called ``Hamiltonian
Path'' math problem ``determining an airline flight path between
several cities where each city would only be visited once,'' Liu
and his colleagues write.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Liu's team reports using DNA to solve what the
editorial commentators, Ogihara and Ray, describe as ``a
particularly difficult problem in mathematical logic.'' Their
solution ``represents a remarkable improvement over the best
conventional computer algorithm,'' Ogihara and Ray write.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is ``still unrealistic'' for the Liu team to hope to
use DNA computing to solve far grander problems, Ogihara and Ray
said. ``The authors claim that their ... approach is designed to
scale up to problems of practical significance, but solving a
problem that would embarrass a conventional computer is a long way
off.''
</P>
<P>
   History justifies such caution. DNA computing is a recent entry
in an old horse race: the effort to develop computer systems based
on fundamentally different physical principles from those of
today's computers. Some schemes have fallen flat: a plan for
``hydraulic'' computers, described in Scientific American three
decades ago, that would have worked by using fluids pumped through
pipes rather than electrons moving through wires and microchips.
</P>
<P>
   But others remain hot topics. These include efforts to develop
``quantum'' computers that deploy codes based on the eerie physical
phenomena of the subatomic world, and ``nanotechnological''
computers with electronic ``switches'' and ``gates'' as tiny as
atoms.

&HT;     HOTELIERS GET LITTLE REST ON SLEEP ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By HARRY SHATTUCK  
 &HT;     c.2000 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ I did a double-take upon reading the promotion from
Westin Hotels &AMP; Resorts: ``To purchase your hotel room pillow,
visit the front desk or call the Heavenly Hotline.''
</P>
<P>
   Was this a joke? I don't know about you, but last time I spent a
night on the road I had to summon housekeeping twice and stack four
flimsy pillows just to lift my head higher than my feet.
</P>
<P>
   Wait! There's more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Purchase your hotel bed. Twin sets $1,300. Kings $1,900.''
</P>
<P>
   I've spent countless nights in hotels and long ago established
three criteria for an acceptable bed: (1) I only slide off the side
once or twice. (2) My toes barely wiggle beyond the foot of the bed
(I'm 5-foot-7; how does professional basketball player Hakeem
Olajuwon manage?). (3) I wake up with my back intact.
</P>
<P>
   I've certainly never felt an urge to take a hotel bed home. But
maybe I've been sleeping in the past.
</P>
<P>
   PREFERRED OVER SEX
</P>
<P>
   Hoteliers spent much of the '90s figuring out how to keep us
happy all day _ creating spas and health clubs; diversifying
restaurants and shops; incorporating state-of-the-art entertainment
systems into guest rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as a new century begins, the focus is on putting us to
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because we've asked for it.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent Westin-sponsored survey of 600 frequent travelers,
more than twice as many respondents said they would prefer a great
night's sleep over great sex.
</P>
<P>
   As if that message isn't strong enough: _ Respondents said they
get 51 percent less sleep on the road than at home and are 31
percent more likely to wake up in the middle of the night.
</P>
<P>
   _ On average, 24 minutes is required to fall asleep compared
with 15 minutes at home.
</P>
<P>
   _ Thirty-one percent said their performance on the road has
suffered because of a bad night's sleep in a hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: 63 percent said that a good night's sleep is the
most important service a hotel can provide.
</P>
<P>
   MORE THAN THE SHEETS
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the bed isn't the only factor involved. As early as
1994, Hilton Hotels, in cooperation with the National Sleep
Foundation, established a Sleep and the Traveler program through
which the main priorities for sound sleep were pinpointed as (1)
noise reduction; (2) improved bedding; and (3) improved temperature
control.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton addressed these and other concerns by installing
experimental ``Sleep-Tight Rooms'' _ with such features as ear
plugs, eye masks, ``natural sounds'' music and black-out (sealed)
curtains _ at several of its hotels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that people want a good night's sleep,''
said Alan T.
</P>
<P>
   Stutts, dean of the University of Houston's Conrad N. Hilton
College of Hotel and Restaurant Management. ``The mattress may be
part of that. The linens may be part. But air quality also is an
issue. Noise factors are an issue. The confidence for a business
traveler that you can accomplish what you want to do is an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, 49 percent of those surveyed by Westin cited the bed as
the most important item in a room (with no other item _ even a TV _
mentioned by as many as 10 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Thus, ``The Heavenly Bed.''
</P>
<P>
   Starwood Hotels &AMP; Resorts Worldwide, Westin's parent company, is
investing $30 million on placing 52,000 Heavenly Beds in 39,552
guest rooms throughout the United States and Canada. The company
expects to complete this task by early spring, then install the
beds at international properties. The new beds already are in place
at Houston's Westin Oaks and Westin Galleria hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Features include: _ A custom-designed pillowtop mattress set by
Simmons with 900 individual coils.
</P>
<P>
   _ Three sheets ranging in thread count from 180 to 250.
</P>
<P>
   _ A down blanket, with separate versions for three climates: a
Northern Star (29 ounces of down), Southern Star (18 ounces of
down) and Tropical Star (10 ounces of down).
</P>
<P>
   _ A comforter and duvet.
</P>
<P>
   _ Five pillows, including two king-size, 50/50
goose-down/goose-feather pillows.
</P>
<P>
   The future likely holds more advancements.
</P>
<P>
   According to UH's Stutts, technology now being studied includes
a comforter that regulates based on body temperature. ``If you are
hot-natured and tend to kick the covers, and your spouse is cold,
the comforter senses body temperature and releases heat or retains
heat,'' Stutts said. ``It works on a similar principle to the
thermal shields on the space shuttle.''
</P>
<P>
   Achieving total customer satisfaction may not be easy. As part
of Westin's sleep study, conducted for the chain by a New
York-based research firm, the main criticism by 27 percent of
respondents was that hotel mattresses are too soft. For another 21
percent, the No. 1 complaint was that mattresses are too hard.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Stutts said two concepts _ one utilizing
springs and the other air _ are being studied that will allow hotel
guests to adjust the firmness of each side of a bed.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, here are some other findings in the Westin
survey: _ Women take longer to fall asleep in a hotel room than
men, and more women than men cite the poor quality of sleep in
hotels as compared to home.
</P>
<P>
   _ When asked what they miss most about sleeping at home when
they are in a hotel, 43 percent of men name their spouse or
significant other. Only 22 percent of women name their
spouse/significant other; 37 percent cite their own bed.
</P>
<P>
   _ To try to fall asleep in hotel rooms, 53 percent of travelers
read, 47 percent call their family, 43 percent draw the curtains or
shut the blinds and 42 percent leave the television on.
</P>
<P>
   _ Seventy-nine percent of those watching TV say they turn to
CNN, 59 percent access a national network's news, 51 percent watch
local news, 42 percent view the Weather Channel and 17 percent turn
to C-Span. Only 11 percent watch _ or admit to watching _ adult
movies.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, about that Heavenly Hotline: It's 877-777-5418. Beds
and accessories are available.

&HT;     HIGH-GEAR ACTION STEERS FAMILIES TO DAYTONA BEACH 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (Eds.: Note that Daytona 500 is Feb. 20.)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SYD KEARNEY  
 &HT;     c.2000 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Americans love their beaches.
</P>
<P>
   The sand, the sun, the smell of the surf _ it's no wonder that
more than 50 million towel-toting Americans are expected to descend
on U.S.
</P>
<P>
   beaches this summer. That number is courtesy of the Travel
Industry Association of America, which also points out that nearly
half of adult travelers don't plan their activities until after
they've arrived at a destination.
</P>
<P>
   That could be problematic at many beach destinations, where
options may be limited to eating, sleeping, sunbathing and the
occasional round of miniature golf.
</P>
<P>
   Families, in particular, require an array of recreational and
cultural diversions. No parent wants to hear ``I'm bored'' two days
into a weeklong vacation.
</P>
<P>
   One destination revving up the fun is sun-soaked Daytona Beach.
Long known for its spring break, its Bike Week motorcycle festival
and its speedway, Daytona Beach welcomes more than 8 million
visitors each year, enticing Florida-bound families with nature
cruises, historical sites, water sports and a diverse menu of
attractions, including one of the world's largest flea markets.
</P>
<P>
   Comprising seven communities (Port Orange, South Daytona,
Daytona Beach, Holly Hill, Ormond Beach, Daytona Beach Shores and
Ponce Inlet), the Daytona Beach area boasts 23 miles of coastline
on the Atlantic Ocean and three major rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Boat tours of the Halifax River, which flows between the
mainland and the peninsula and is also known as the Intracoastal
Waterway, offer a leisurely introduction to Central Florida's
natural wonders. A handful of companies offer boat tours ranging
from morning birding excursions to romantic sunset outings.
Pelicans, herons and bottle-nosed dolphins are among the wildlife
that can be seen on these casual expeditions.
</P>
<P>
   Other boat operators ply the waters of the quiet St. Johns
River. This is where, November-March, you're most likely to see the
lovable manatees. Like aquatic lawn mowers, manatees consume
massive amounts of sea grasses to maintain their 1,000-pound-plus
bulk. In addition to these playful but endangered marine mammals,
you may see alligators, otters, ospreys and bald eagles.
</P>
<P>
   Outdoor recreation is at the heart of a vacation at Daytona
Beach, where the average daytime temperature is 70 degrees. Golf
(more than a dozen courses dot this stretch of coast), horseback
riding, parasailing, windsurfing, snorkeling, scuba diving, hiking,
inline skating and canoeing are among the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Or enjoy a lazy afternoon of fishing. No license is required at
the Main Street Pier, which ranges a quarter mile into the
Atlantic. Families can rent poles and buy bait at the pier, then
drop their lines, sit back and watch the graceful pelicans fly by.
</P>
<P>
   The pier is at Daytona Beach's popular boardwalk, site of two
landmarks: the Clocktower and the Bandshell, built of coquina rock
by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1937. Other boardwalk
diversions include gondola and Space Needle rides.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby is Daytona Beach's newest attraction. Caribbean-themed
Adventure Landing is an architectural triumph, packing into just
five acres a quarter-mile go-cart track, a large video-game arcade,
three miniature-golf courses, three restaurants and a water park
with 12 slides, a wave pool and a drift river. Parents, watch your
wallets _ this place is a kids' wonderland.
</P>
<P>
   While the emphasis is fun in the sun, the Daytona Beach area has
several historic sites worth a stop.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular is the charming Ponce de Leon Inlet Lighthouse,
built in 1887 on the southern tip of the peninsula. Hardy visitors
can climb 203 steps to the top of the 175-foot-tall lighthouse for
spectacular views of the coast. Scattered on the grounds are
buildings that once were homes for lighthouse keepers. The
structures now house a lighthouse museum, the Museum of the Sea and
other marine exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   The Casements, a mansion built in 1912 and purchased by
mega-millionaire John D. Rockefeller as a winter home in 1918,
today is a museum and cultural center. It exhibits period
furniture, some terrific examples of Hungarian folk art and a fine
collection of Boy Scout memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   Don't miss the Retreat on the Bethune-Cookman College campus.
The Retreat was the name given to college founder Mary McLeon
Bethune's home. Built in 1915, it remains very much as it was when
she died in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   Bethune, the 15th of 17 children born to freed slaves, became a
teacher and founded her school in 1904 with five students and
$1.50. In the mid-1920s, her all-women's school merged with the
all-male Cookman Institute. Today Bethune-Cookman thrives as a
private liberal-arts college.
</P>
<P>
   Bethune became one of the most influential women of her time. In
1935, she led the first meeting of President Franklin D.
Roosevelt's ``Negro Cabinet,'' an unofficial but influential group
of advisers on minority issues. Eleanore Roosevelt became a friend
and is known to have spent the night at the Retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Bethune is buried on the tidy, tree-shaded campus.
</P>
<P>
   Daytona Beach's ballpark is another historic site. On March 17,
1946, Jackie Robinson broke the major-league color barrier by
playing in a baseball game here against the Brooklyn Dodgers.
Robinson was playing for the Montreal Royals, a Dodgers farm team,
and segregationist laws had kept him from playing at other Florida
ballparks.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, the park was renamed Jackie Robinson Ballpark; a
bronze statue of the Hall-of-Famer stands at the entrance to the
park, now home to the Florida State League's Daytona Beach Cubs, an
affiliate of the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Daytona Beach gets about 54 inches of precipitation a year _
just enough to warrant mention of a few rainy-day pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Museum of Arts and Sciences, comprising a Cuban art
collection, an African wing, a planetarium and a prehistory
collection starring the 14-foot-tall skeleton of a 130,000-year-old
ground sloth.
</P>
<P>
   Or chill out at the new Daytona Iceplex, which hosts
recreational ice skating as well as the local minor-league hockey
club, the Riptides.
</P>
<P>
   And did we forget to mention the track? Daytona International
Speedway, a 2.5-mile tri-oval track, is billed as the World Center
of Racing. It hosts nine racing weekends each year, ranging from
go-carts to sports cars. The track will host the most famous race
of the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, the Daytona
500, on Feb. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Even when engines aren't roaring, the speedway attracts
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Daytona USA offers an interactive and often thrilling look at
motor sports. Fans can demonstrate their mechanic skills during a
fast-paced pit stop, test their NASCAR knowledge via computer, play
race announcer and take a walk through motor-sports history. They
also can explore the track on a behind-the-scenes tour that
includes stops on Pit Row and at one of the track's 31-degree
banks.
</P>
<P>
   Race fans will appreciate the up-close view of the car that won
the last Daytona 500. Jeff Gordon's No. 24 car didn't even get a
bath before it was pulled into Daytona USA's Victory Lane, where it
will remain until next month's race.
</P>
<P>
   While the speedway is a hit with visitors, Daytona Beach's big
wheel is Bike Week.
</P>
<P>
   Held in early March, Bike Week is the country's largest
motorcycle event and the city's biggest tourism event, attracting
more than 500,000 motorcyclists from around the world. The 10-day
festival will celebrate its 59th birthday this year.
</P>
<P>
   Among the festivities are concerts, swap meets, races, a
Harley-Davidson parade and the Blessing of the Bikes. While the
leather-clad action is nonstop, most bikers come merely to relax
and to see and be seen. (A more family-oriented event,
Biketoberfest, is drawing as many as 60,000 motorcycle enthusiasts
each October.) Daytona Beach has been a magnet for motor-sports
fans since 1902, when Ransom Olds, playboy maker of the Oldsmobile
automobile, began racing his sports car against those of his
highfalutin pals. His car, known as the Pirate, was clocked at 50
mph flying down Ormond Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years later, the beach was the site of automotive
history when Englishman Henry Segrave broke the 200 mph mark with
his Sunbeam Mystery S car. Between 1928 and 1935, the land speed
record was broken five times on Daytona's hard-packed sands.
</P>
<P>
   That brings up another reason why motor-sports fans love Daytona
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   While racing is no longer allowed, driving on the beach is
permitted in designated areas. For many visitors, cruising on the
sand is a novelty.
</P>
<P>
   For locals, it's a decades-old tradition threatened by
conservationists, who want to ban beach driving to protect
endangered sea-turtle hatchlings.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you walk or ride, exploring Daytona's beach can be a
gas.

TIM ROTH TURNS TO DIRECTING IN `THE WAR ZONE' 

</HEADLINE>

c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first call to Tim Roth about his movie ``The War Zone''
didn't work out. Bad timing.
</P>
<P>
   Roth was at a Pasadena, Calif., playground with two of his sons,
trying to hook the youngest into a child's swing. Juggling the cell
phone on his shoulder made it tougher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hold on one more second; we're having swing issues here,''
Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   In the background there was child-sized laughter. Daddy doing an
interview wasn't the kids' problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife is sick, and so I ran from school down to have a
picnic, and (the interview) completely slipped my mind,'' Roth
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Should we try again later?
</P>
<P>
   ``That'd be great,'' he said. ``One of them will be napping.''
</P>
<P>
   As an actor, Roth has a busy career playing offbeat supporting
roles, mostly gritty low-lifes with an attitude. He's a favorite of
filmmaker Quentin Tarantino.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Pulp Fiction,'' Roth was the petty thief Pumpkin. With his
girlfriend, Honey Bunny, he tried to rob a diner, only to run into
gun totting Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Rob Roy,'' Roth was a wicked, foppish villain who raped the
character played by Jessica Lange. He was so memorably evil he got
an Oscar nomination.
</P>
<P>
   He was more sympathetic in last year's ``The Legend of 1900,''
starring as a pianist who lived his whole life on an ocean liner.
</P>
<P>
   But Roth sometimes gets weary of acting, and he started looking
for a film to direct. That led to ``The War Zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Which may lead to a new career, because ``The War Zone,''
opening Friday, is a devastating film experience, not soon to be
forgotten. It is a serious, sober and unflinching view of incest
and sexual child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   It was not what Roth expected to be shooting, but when he read
the novel he quickly accepted the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something that couldn't be denied,'' Roth said. ``I've
been around victims all my life. It's a subject I know. I was glad
that it came to me rather than somebody who didn't know the
subject.''
</P>
<P>
   Roth said he has been close to several victims of sexual abuse
and that he believes it is far more common than most people know.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only have the people we've caught, or the people who have
spoken about their abuse,'' Roth said. ``Mostly it's not going to
get reported. My opinion, and it's purely my opinion, is that it's
highly epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on a novel by Alexander Stuart, who also did the
screenplay, ``The War Zone'' is about a seemingly normal English
family.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which is not rated, is especially troubling due to
the realistic, objective approach Roth takes to the material. He
keeps the camera still most of the time _ rather than cutting
frequently to different angles and faces _ drawing us into the
family life with its everyday chit-chat and, later, uncomfortable
silences.
</P>
<P>
   The film is anything but glamorous or titillating: the one
scene, late in the movie, in which the audience sees incestuous
sex, is shot from a distance and fairly dark. But it is still
brutal to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Because Roth takes a long time developing his characters into
real, seemingly likable people, it seems as if we are exposed to
much more. Some viewers have walked out of screenings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been accused of being exploitive,'' Roth said. ``Merely
out for titillation, uh, what else? Pornographic, abusive ... I
really don't know (why). If someone sees it as an abusive film, I
kind of worry about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to show this is what it feels like. This is what they
do, and this is how it feels.''
</P>
<P>
   Roth believes the movie can be informative to young people, but
he says parents should definitely see the movie before they decide
whether to allow children to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told my oldest son he can't see it. He's 15. This would
be one of his first sexual experiences. I don't want that to be the
case.''
</P>
<P>
   Making the movie even more disturbing is how nice everyone is,
even the father _ the abuser of the film's family. It was a hard
role for actor Ray Winstone. He almost left the project midshoot
because he couldn't handle the sexual scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very scared,'' Roth said. ``But we created a tight
family around him, and he got through it. There were times I
thought we were going to lose him _ or I was going to lose some of
the crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awful. (The first part of the movie) created a tight
family, and they didn't want to see their family destroyed in this
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I love about Ray, he didn't understand what this
character was about _ how can we? _ he was just going on his
instincts that it was something that should be told.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day came when he had to be (this side of) this man, which
we had kind of separated from the man he was playing in the rest of
the film. It was a very tough day for him. But Lara (Belmont, who
plays his daughter) got him through it. And we all got him through
it. And they all got us through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Roth did a long search for the right young people to play the
children of the family, an 18-year-old girl and a 15-year-old boy.
He finally selected two nonactors, Belmont and Freddie Cunliffe,
because he didn't want viewers to think of them as stars of some TV
show. And he wanted their acting to be raw, not slick.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are young and have been trained in some kind of
manner are bringing with them a lot of (junk) that's been taught to
them,'' he said, adding, ``If I taught Lara and Freddie (junk),
it's the kind of (junk) I like.''
</P>
<P>
   Roth said he cleared the script with the young actors' parents,
got them agents and kept counselors on the set.
</P>
<P>
   Roth has been pleased with most of the early response to ``The
War Zone,'' especially with people who talk to him afterward about
their own experiences with abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have spoken to people who have never spoken about it before
who have started talking because of having seen the film,'' Roth
said. ``That's been a wonderful experience.''

 &HT;    TEXAS TO SPLIT $35 MILLION IN FINES FOR PIPELINE LEAKS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Environmental Protection Agency said Thursday
that Koch Industries Inc. will pay $35 million in fines and
penalties to settle claims of contamination from oil spills in six
states. Texas will get half of the funds.
</P>
<P>
   Texas will receive $15 million of the record $30 million civil
penalty and another $2.5 million from the settlement for state
environmental projects, EPA Administrator Carol Browner said at a
news conference. Koch also agreed to spend another $1 million for a
pipeline safety study in Texas, Kansas and Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement covers claims of more than 300 oil spills from
pipelines and other facilities between 1990 and 1997. Most took
place in Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas. In one instance, 90,300
gallons spilled into Corpus Christi Bay and Nueces Bay, causing a
12-mile oil slick and killing thousands of fish, Browner said.
</P>
<P>
   Over a seven-year period, Browner said, ``Koch illegally
discharged more than 3 million gallons of crude oil from its
pipelines and into the ponds, lakes, rivers and shorelines of
Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri and Alabama.''
</P>
<P>
   Based in Wichita, Kan., Koch is the nation's largest pipeline
company with more than 35,000 miles of pipeline in the United
States and Canada. It also operates refineries in Texas and
Minnesota through its Koch Petroleum Group subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   At a Washington news conference, Browner said the case against
Koch had been ``one of our most difficult and contentious
environmental actions ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Koch issued a statement that the company had reduced
its crude oil pipeline leaks by more than 90 percent during the
1990s and spent nearly $1 billion on environmental improvements at
its facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the settlement is fair and reasonable and will
avoid even more years of litigation,'' said Pat McCann, senior vice
president of Koch Pipeline Co., a division of Koch Industries.
</P>
<P>
   The $30 million fine is the largest civil penalty ever imposed
on a company under federal environmental law, said Browner.
However, Koch spokesperson Mary Beth Jarvis disputed that this was
the record, arguing that civil portion of penalties imposed for the
1989 Exxon Valdez tanker disaster in Alaska were larger. That case
also included criminal fines.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Texas had joined the Justice Department and EPA in
suing Koch and Browner thanked Texas Attorney General John Cornyn
for his legal assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson that corporations must learn is that ``there is no
profit in pollution,'' said Browner. ``You pollute. You pay. It's
that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the spills were caused by corrosion of pipelines in
rural areas, the EPA said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, Koch must assess the condition of 2,500
miles of specific pipelines and repair any defects. These include
Texas pipelines that run between Austin and Waco and between San
Antonio and Austin, as well as pipelines between Gonzales and Waco
and between Waco and Hillsboro.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement also requires Koch to improve its program of
preventing and detecting pipeline leaks and to better inspect and
maintain its pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to paying the $30 million fine, Koch agreed to spend
a total of $5 million on environmental programs hurt most by its
allegedly illegal discharges. These include:
</P>
<P>
   _ $2.5 million for Texas environmental projects to be carried
out under the direction of state officials. The projects will be
focused on the Corpus Christi Bay area, where one of the largest
spills occurred.
</P>
<P>
   _ $1 million for a pipeline safety study in Texas, Kansas and
Oklahoma aimed at educating the oil and gas industry about spill
prevention.
</P>
<P>
   _ $1.5 million to buy and preserve wetlands or wildlife
preserves in Kansas and Oklahoma.

HIGH-GEAR ACTION STEERS FAMILIES TO DAYTONA BEACH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Note that Daytona 500 is Feb. 20.) 
 
By SYD KEARNEY 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Americans love their beaches.
</P>
<P>
   The sand, the sun, the smell of the surf _ it's no wonder that
more than 50 million towel-toting Americans are expected to descend
on U.S. beaches this summer. That number is courtesy of the Travel
Industry Association of America, which also points out that nearly
half of adult travelers don't plan their activities until after
they've arrived at a destination.
</P>
<P>
   That could be problematic at many beach destinations, where
options may be limited to eating, sleeping, sunbathing and the
occasional round of miniature golf.
</P>
<P>
   Families, in particular, require an array of recreational and
cultural diversions. No parent wants to hear ``I'm bored'' two days
into a weeklong vacation.
</P>
<P>
   One destination revving up the fun is sun-soaked Daytona Beach.
Long known for its spring break, its Bike Week motorcycle festival
and its speedway, Daytona Beach welcomes more than 8 million
visitors each year, enticing Florida-bound families with nature
cruises, historical sites, water sports and a diverse menu of
attractions, including one of the world's largest flea markets.
</P>
<P>
   Comprising seven communities (Port Orange, South Daytona,
Daytona Beach, Holly Hill, Ormond Beach, Daytona Beach Shores and
Ponce Inlet), the Daytona Beach area boasts 23 miles of coastline
on the Atlantic Ocean and three major rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Boat tours of the Halifax River, which flows between the
mainland and the peninsula and is also known as the Intracoastal
Waterway, offer a leisurely introduction to Central Florida's
natural wonders. A handful of companies offer boat tours ranging
from morning birding excursions to romantic sunset outings.
Pelicans, herons and bottle-nosed dolphins are among the wildlife
that can be seen on these casual expeditions.
</P>
<P>
   Other boat operators ply the waters of the quiet St. Johns
River. This is where, November-March, you're most likely to see the
lovable manatees. Like aquatic lawn mowers, manatees consume
massive amounts of sea grasses to maintain their 1,000-pound-plus
bulk. In addition to these playful but endangered marine mammals,
you may see alligators, otters, ospreys and bald eagles.
</P>
<P>
   Outdoor recreation is at the heart of a vacation at Daytona
Beach, where the average daytime temperature is 70 degrees. Golf
(more than a dozen courses dot this stretch of coast), horseback
riding, parasailing, windsurfing, snorkeling, scuba diving, hiking,
inline skating and canoeing are among the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Or enjoy a lazy afternoon of fishing. No license is required at
the Main Street Pier, which ranges a quarter mile into the
Atlantic. Families can rent poles and buy bait at the pier, then
drop their lines, sit back and watch the graceful pelicans fly by.
</P>
<P>
   The pier is at Daytona Beach's popular boardwalk, site of two
landmarks: the Clocktower and the Bandshell, built of coquina rock
by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1937. Other boardwalk
diversions include gondola and Space Needle rides.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby is Daytona Beach's newest attraction. Caribbean-themed
Adventure Landing is an architectural triumph, packing into just
five acres a quarter-mile go-cart track, a large video-game arcade,
three miniature-golf courses, three restaurants and a water park
with 12 slides, a wave pool and a drift river. Parents, watch your
wallets _ this place is a kids' wonderland.
</P>
<P>
   While the emphasis is fun in the sun, the Daytona Beach area has
several historic sites worth a stop.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular is the charming Ponce de Leon Inlet Lighthouse,
built in 1887 on the southern tip of the peninsula. Hardy visitors
can climb 203 steps to the top of the 175-foot-tall lighthouse for
spectacular views of the coast. Scattered on the grounds are
buildings that once were homes for lighthouse keepers. The
structures now house a lighthouse museum, the Museum of the Sea and
other marine exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   The Casements, a mansion built in 1912 and purchased by
mega-millionaire John D. Rockefeller as a winter home in 1918,
today is a museum and cultural center. It exhibits period
furniture, some terrific examples of Hungarian folk art and a fine
collection of Boy Scout memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   Don't miss the Retreat on the Bethune-Cookman College campus.
The Retreat was the name given to college founder Mary McLeon
Bethune's home. Built in 1915, it remains very much as it was when
she died in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   Bethune, the 15th of 17 children born to freed slaves, became a
teacher and founded her school in 1904 with five students and
$1.50. In the mid-1920s, her all-women's school merged with the
all-male Cookman Institute. Today Bethune-Cookman thrives as a
private liberal-arts college.
</P>
<P>
   Bethune became one of the most influential women of her time. In
1935, she led the first meeting of President Franklin D.
Roosevelt's ``Negro Cabinet,'' an unofficial but influential group
of advisers on minority issues. Eleanore Roosevelt became a friend
and is known to have spent the night at the Retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Bethune is buried on the tidy, tree-shaded campus.
</P>
<P>
   Daytona Beach's ballpark is another historic site. On March 17,
1946, Jackie Robinson broke the major-league color barrier by
playing in a baseball game here against the Brooklyn Dodgers.
Robinson was playing for the Montreal Royals, a Dodgers farm team,
and segregationist laws had kept him from playing at other Florida
ballparks.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, the park was renamed Jackie Robinson Ballpark; a
bronze statue of the Hall-of-Famer stands at the entrance to the
park, now home to the Florida State League's Daytona Beach Cubs, an
affiliate of the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Daytona Beach gets about 54 inches of precipitation a year _
just enough to warrant mention of a few rainy-day pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Museum of Arts and Sciences, comprising a Cuban art
collection, an African wing, a planetarium and a prehistory
collection starring the 14-foot-tall skeleton of a 130,000-year-old
ground sloth.
</P>
<P>
   Or chill out at the new Daytona Iceplex, which hosts
recreational ice skating as well as the local minor-league hockey
club, the Riptides.
</P>
<P>
   And did we forget to mention the track?
</P>
<P>
   Daytona International Speedway, a 2.5-mile tri-oval track, is
billed as the World Center of Racing. It hosts nine racing weekends
each year, ranging from go-carts to sports cars. The track will
host the most famous race of the National Association for Stock Car
Auto Racing, the Daytona 500, on Feb. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Even when engines aren't roaring, the speedway attracts
visitors. Daytona USA offers an interactive and often thrilling
look at motor sports. Fans can demonstrate their mechanic skills
during a fast-paced pit stop, test their NASCAR knowledge via
computer, play race announcer and take a walk through motor-sports
history. They also can explore the track on a behind-the-scenes
tour that includes stops on Pit Row and at one of the track's
31-degree banks.
</P>
<P>
   Race fans will appreciate the up-close view of the car that won
the last Daytona 500. Jeff Gordon's No. 24 car didn't even get a
bath before it was pulled into Daytona USA's Victory Lane, where it
will remain until next month's race.
</P>
<P>
   While the speedway is a hit with visitors, Daytona Beach's big
wheel is Bike Week.
</P>
<P>
   Held in early March, Bike Week is the country's largest
motorcycle event and the city's biggest tourism event, attracting
more than 500,000 motorcyclists from around the world. The 10-day
festival will celebrate its 59th birthday this year.
</P>
<P>
   Among the festivities are concerts, swap meets, races, a
Harley-Davidson parade and the Blessing of the Bikes. While the
leather-clad action is nonstop, most bikers come merely to relax
and to see and be seen. (A more family-oriented event,
Biketoberfest, is drawing as many as 60,000 motorcycle enthusiasts
each October.)
</P>
<P>
   Daytona Beach has been a magnet for motor-sports fans since
1902, when Ransom Olds, playboy maker of the Oldsmobile automobile,
began racing his sports car against those of his highfalutin pals.
His car, known as the Pirate, was clocked at 50 mph flying down
Ormond Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years later, the beach was the site of automotive
history when Englishman Henry Segrave broke the 200 mph mark with
his Sunbeam Mystery S car. Between 1928 and 1935, the land speed
record was broken five times on Daytona's hard-packed sands.
</P>
<P>
   That brings up another reason why motor-sports fans love Daytona
Beach. While racing is no longer allowed, driving on the beach is
permitted in designated areas. For many visitors, cruising on the
sand is a novelty. For locals, it's a decades-old tradition
threatened by conservationists, who want to ban beach driving to
protect endangered sea-turtle hatchlings.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you walk or ride, exploring Daytona's beach can be a
gas.

   HOUSTON _ Bamboleo represents all that is right with the

   Right up until a young Cuban boy is found in the waters off
Miami. A survivor of an escape from Cuba that took his mother's

new rounds of anti-Castro protests in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Bamboleo _ a timba ensemble of young musicians visiting the
United States to promote its new album, ``Ya No Hace Falta'' (I
Don't Need You Anymore), _ is forced into the role of political
ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   For a brief time the group experiences what it's like to be
``them'' to the United States' ``us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The band doesn't really like to take questions about
politics,'' says Angelica Sepulveda, a manager at Ahi-Nama Records,
the record label that promotes Bamboleo and other Cuban bands in
the States. ``They won't even discuss that little boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Maslon, owner of Ahi-Nama, puts it more succinctly. ``They
resent that they have to be asked. My groups are not political.''
</P>
<P>
   The episode is a minor blip that might make Bamboleo's visa
process more difficult in the short term and require more security
for the band in cities with anti-Cuba factions. It is not enough,
however, to stop the infiltration of the island's music into the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   After 40 years of embargo, contemporary timba, rumba and salsa
artists are anxious for a new audience. The spoils of two years of
a Latin-music renaissance in the United States are finally starting
to be felt.
</P>
<P>
   It started with the international acclaim for Buena Vista Social
Club's album of ``son,'' traditional Cuban folk music. Since then,
Mexican-born rocker Carlos Santana has put out ``Supernatural,'' an
album of Afro-Latin grooves recognized with 10 Grammy nominations.
</P>
<P>
   In between, there's been a glitzy pop bonanza of new stars such
as Jennifer Lopez, Ricky Martin and Enrique Iglesias. The next wave
should be a combination of old and new.
</P>
<P>
   Young Latin artists no longer have to ``Americanize'' their
sound to gain international recognition. Groups like Bamboleo and
Ahi-Nama label-mate Arte Mixto could be leading the way toward a
more cultural representation of Cuba's roots.
</P>
<P>
   If Bamboleo's 12-member assault of timba and Cuban ``clave''
draws well at Houston's Club Tropicana on Jan.18, expect it to be
the first in a line of Cuban bands to play in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to keep bringing these bands as long as it's
affordable,'' say Luis Ricardo, co-promoter of Houston's Bamboleo
show. ``I hope this is the start of a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   By day Ricardo is not a concert promoter. He's an insurance
broker. His partner, Juan R. Duran, owns a barber shop in Houston.
Both are Cuban natives. Ricardo is a percussionist who plays
several nights a week in a local salsa band, Batacha.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Ricardo saw Bamboleo while visiting Cuba and
immediately had thoughts about bringing the group to Houston. After
meeting Maslon last year at an Arte Mixto concert in New Orleans,
he found his opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always thought there was a definite market for this in
Houston,'' Ricardo says. ``If this works, there'll be more Ahi-Nama
bands coming here.''
</P>
<P>
   Timba music is an upbeat, fusion-enhanced, electrified version
of the traditional Cuban ``son'' that many now associate with Buena
Vista Social Club, which performs here Feb. 15 at Jones Hall.
Bomboleo is an even higher-energy departure. Translated, leader
Lazaro Valdes says, the band's name means ``movement,'' and the
band certainly doesn't lack that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, it's a fusion of different rhythms _ rumba,
hip-hop, Latin bop and jazz,'' Valdes says. ``All the groups that
do timba have a pattern that they follow. We take it further with
improvisations, mambos, percussion effect and style.''
</P>
<P>
   The members range in ages from 25 to 35 and are graduates from
the National School of Arts in Havana. Its base in Cuban music
can't be ignored, but songs like ``Circulame'' and ``Yo No Me
Parezco a Nadie'' also have roots in such '70s funk as Earth Wind &AMP;
Fire and the Commodores.
</P>
<P>
   The fashions of Valdes and the four vocalists _ Alejandro
Borrero, Jorge David Rodriguez, Yordamis Megret and Vannia Borges
Hernandez _ are that of a very elegant Latin soap opera. The men
wear Italian suits in black and burgundy; they accessorize with
gold chains and leather shoes.
</P>
<P>
   The women wear luxurious evening gowns and trademark hair so
short it looks painted on their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Around Cuba, young women have taken to the hairdo the way
American teens took to the platform sneakers worn by the Spice
Girls a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   After touring Europe with Los Van Van and Celia Cruz, Bambeleo
has gathered a following in France, Germany and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   In the States, though, it's often like starting from the
beginning, with politics constantly playing a role in the band's
success. Getting visas is easier with every visit, but the band has
experienced instances when shows were delayed or canceled because
of customs.
</P>
<P>
   One can't help but think that contemporary Cuban music will
continue to find its way onto U.S. soil _ first through Miami, New
York and Los Angeles. After that, who knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big honor to come to the United States and share Cuban
music as it is today,'' Valdes says. ``But it's only the beginning.
Our objective is to conquer the world with our sound.''
</P>
<P>
   This week Houston; tomorrow the world.

WNBA CHAMPION COMETS: TRIUMPH OVER TRAGEDY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `HEARTS OF CHAMPIONS'
</P>
<P>
   For the Houston Comets, 1999 was a wrenching ordeal capped by an
incredible triumph. This video _ whose complete title is ``Hearts
of Champions: The Official WNBA Championship Video'' _ ably
captures how a dedicated team overcame adversity and responded with
heroism.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the setbacks, of course, was the illness of Kim
Perrot, the team's fiery emotional leader who succumbed to cancer
just days before the playoffs began.
</P>
<P>
   But her impact remained, as perhaps it always will.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence is everywhere. Take the night that Comets star Cynthia
Cooper learned her close friend was nearing the end. Cooper took
the court and scored 42 points.
</P>
<P>
   As the narration puts it, ``Though their hearts were broken,
their spirits were not.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the 47-minute video traces the story with overly
familiar clips and sound bites as the Comets march to their third
consecutive crown.
</P>
<P>
   But it also offers rare glimpses behind the scenes. Most
intriguing are moments when Sheryl Swoopes is heard intensely going
over strategy with her teammates during pauses in the action.
</P>
<P>
   Regular-season highlights are minimal; most of the focus is on
the playoffs _ in carefully edited form.
</P>
<P>
   This is, after all, a product of NBA Entertainment, which wants
to project the best image possible.
</P>
<P>
   Due to that, the video ignores how heated the Comets'
first-round battle with the Los Angeles Sparks became, with
ejections and L.A.'s Lisa Leslie jabbing at the Comets' Tina
Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the finals against the New York Liberty were marked
by opponents embracing each other in support and unity.
</P>
<P>
   With superb camera angles _ including a vantage directly above
the basket _ highlights include Teresa Weatherspoon's remarkable
half-court shot to steal a win at the end of Game 2. That's
followed by the Comets' determined title-clinching performance and
a moving celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The tape ends with a sassy music video by the Houston group
Destiny's Child for ``Jumpin' Jumpin','' followed by a memorial
tribute.
</P>
<P>
   A photo of Perrot is shown with her name and the years of her
life. She may not have played for the Comets in 1999, but she was
as much a part of that season as anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 4 stars.

</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`LAKE PLACID' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This spry horror comedy rises above convention with sharp
dialogue and lively, earnest performances.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing from ``Jaws,'' the script is by TV wonder boy David E.
Kelley, who sets a massive crocodile to chomping on cattle and
humans in a lovely Maine lake.
</P>
<P>
   Bridget Fonda plays the fish out of water _ a paleontologist
from New York _ with Bill Pullman as the nice-guy game warden who
catches her eye.
</P>
<P>
   But Oliver Platt owns the film as an obsessive inheritance-brat
who stalks crocs with near-spiritual zeal. Sparking much crisp
verbal sparring, he makes this monster mash sing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lake Placid'' ripples with other fun flourishes, from Betty
White as a grumpy granny who treats crocs as pets to a surprising
forest dance party to the tune of Tom Jones' ``It's Not Unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Grisly scenes are quick, brief and amusingly appalling, in the
vein of ``Mars Attacks.'' The 30-foot croc is a marvel of
computer-generated trickery, wisely hidden for most of the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of which, half of this film amounts to little more than
half an hour. ``Lake Placid'' runs 78 minutes without end credits.
</P>
<P>
   As they say, leave 'em laughing, and this fine little monster
movie does just that.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 3 stars.
</P>
<P>
   1999, R, Fox, CC, VHS priced for rental, DVD $34.98 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `MYSTERY MEN' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to ``Lake Placid,'' ``Mystery Men'' doesn't leave us
laughing. Its sweet but thin premise is stretched over a story that
runs two hours.
</P>
<P>
   William H. Macy, Ben Stiller, Hank Azaria and Janeane Garofalo
are among superhero wannabes in a fantasy city where Capt. Amazing
(Greg Kinnear) is top dog _ and dog is the word.
</P>
<P>
   As the vain, money-grabbing, image-obsessed hero, Kinnear is a
hoot. But his underdog rivals with no superpowers _ ``Blue Raja''
Azaria hurls forks, while ``Shoveler'' Macy wields shovels _ aren't
so much lovable losers as they are pathetic nerds given to empty
theatrics.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Rush plays Casanova Frankenstein, a villain whose
character and powers are as murky as his German accent.
</P>
<P>
   Most often, ``Mystery Men'' plays as a parody of the ``Batman''
films. One problem: The last two ``Batman'' films already were
parodies. Again, the Shoveler and company suffer from upstaging.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 2 stars.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   `DETROIT ROCK CITY' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Released three weeks ago on DVD, this '70s time trip now comes
to tape. Considering its quality, VHS consumers shouldn't mind the
wait.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Rifkin is a promising young director. (He helmed the ``The
Chase'' as well as the agreeably twisted ``Psycho Cop Returns.'')
</P>
<P>
   But the adventures of four randy, rowdy teens as they go to a
Kiss concert in 1978 plays like a poor man's ``Dazed and
Confused,'' saddled with preposterous plotting and incessant
belligerence, with severe beatings played as comedy. Avoid.

HOTELIERS GET LITTLE REST ON SLEEP ISSUE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ I did a double-take upon reading the promotion from
Westin Hotels &AMP; Resorts:
</P>
<P>
   ``To purchase your hotel room pillow, visit the front desk or
call the Heavenly Hotline.''
</P>
<P>
   Was this a joke? I don't know about you, but last time I spent a
night on the road I had to summon housekeeping twice and stack four
flimsy pillows just to lift my head higher than my feet.
</P>
<P>
   Wait! There's more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Purchase your hotel bed. Twin sets $1,300. Kings $1,900.''
</P>
<P>
   I've spent countless nights in hotels and long ago established
three criteria for an acceptable bed: (1) I only slide off the side
once or twice. (2) My toes barely wiggle beyond the foot of the bed
(I'm 5-foot-7; how does professional basketball player Hakeem
Olajuwon manage?). (3) I wake up with my back intact.
</P>
<P>
   I've certainly never felt an urge to take a hotel bed home. But
maybe I've been sleeping in the past.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
PREFERRED OVER SEX &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hoteliers spent much of the '90s figuring out how to keep us
happy all day _ creating spas and health clubs; diversifying
restaurants and shops; incorporating state-of-the-art entertainment
systems into guest rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as a new century begins, the focus is on putting us to
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because we've asked for it.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent Westin-sponsored survey of 600 frequent travelers,
more than twice as many respondents said they would prefer a great
night's sleep over great sex.
</P>
<P>
   As if that message isn't strong enough:
</P>
<P>
   _ Respondents said they get 51 percent less sleep on the road
than at home and are 31 percent more likely to wake up in the
middle of the night.
</P>
<P>
   _ On average, 24 minutes is required to fall asleep compared
with 15 minutes at home.
</P>
<P>
   _ Thirty-one percent said their performance on the road has
suffered because of a bad night's sleep in a hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: 63 percent said that a good night's sleep is the
most important service a hotel can provide.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MORE THAN THE SHEETS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the bed isn't the only factor involved. As early as
1994, Hilton Hotels, in cooperation with the National Sleep
Foundation, established a Sleep and the Traveler program through
which the main priorities for sound sleep were pinpointed as (1)
noise reduction; (2) improved bedding; and (3) improved temperature
control.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton addressed these and other concerns by installing
experimental ``Sleep-Tight Rooms'' _ with such features as ear
plugs, eye masks, ``natural sounds'' music and black-out (sealed)
curtains _ at several of its hotels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that people want a good night's sleep,''
said Alan T. Stutts, dean of the University of Houston's Conrad N.
Hilton College of Hotel and Restaurant Management. ``The mattress
may be part of that. The linens may be part. But air quality also
is an issue. Noise factors are an issue. The confidence for a
business traveler that you can accomplish what you want to do is an
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, 49 percent of those surveyed by Westin cited the bed as
the most important item in a room (with no other item _ even a TV _
mentioned by as many as 10 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Thus, ``The Heavenly Bed.''
</P>
<P>
   Starwood Hotels &AMP; Resorts Worldwide, Westin's parent company, is
investing $30 million on placing 52,000 Heavenly Beds in 39,552
guest rooms throughout the United States and Canada. The company
expects to complete this task by early spring, then install the
beds at international properties. The new beds already are in place
at Houston's Westin Oaks and Westin Galleria hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Features include:
</P>
<P>
   _ A custom-designed pillowtop mattress set by Simmons with 900
individual coils.
</P>
<P>
   _ Three sheets ranging in thread count from 180 to 250.
</P>
<P>
   _ A down blanket, with separate versions for three climates: a
Northern Star (29 ounces of down), Southern Star (18 ounces of
down) and Tropical Star (10 ounces of down).
</P>
<P>
   _ A comforter and duvet.
</P>
<P>
   _ Five pillows, including two king-size, 50/50
goose-down/goose-feather pillows.
</P>
<P>
   The future likely holds more advancements.
</P>
<P>
   According to UH's Stutts, technology now being studied includes
a comforter that regulates based on body temperature. ``If you are
hot-natured and tend to kick the covers, and your spouse is cold,
the comforter senses body temperature and releases heat or retains
heat,'' Stutts said. ``It works on a similar principle to the
thermal shields on the space shuttle.''
</P>
<P>
   Achieving total customer satisfaction may not be easy. As part
of Westin's sleep study, conducted for the chain by a New
York-based research firm, the main criticism by 27 percent of
respondents was that hotel mattresses are too soft. For another 21
percent, the No. 1 complaint was that mattresses are too hard.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Stutts said two concepts _ one utilizing
springs and the other air _ are being studied that will allow hotel
guests to adjust the firmness of each side of a bed.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, here are some other findings in the Westin
survey:
</P>
<P>
   _ Women take longer to fall asleep in a hotel room than men, and
more women than men cite the poor quality of sleep in hotels as
compared to home.
</P>
<P>
   _ When asked what they miss most about sleeping at home when
they are in a hotel, 43 percent of men name their spouse or
significant other. Only 22 percent of women name their
spouse/significant other; 37 percent cite their own bed.
</P>
<P>
   _ To try to fall asleep in hotel rooms, 53 percent of travelers
read, 47 percent call their family, 43 percent draw the curtains or
shut the blinds and 42 percent leave the television on.
</P>
<P>
   _ Seventy-nine percent of those watching TV say they turn to
CNN, 59 percent access a national network's news, 51 percent watch
local news, 42 percent view the Weather Channel and 17 percent turn
to C-Span. Only 11 percent watch _ or admit to watching _ adult
movies.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, about that Heavenly Hotline: It's 877-777-5418. Beds
and accessories are available.

&HT;     PUBLISHER SAYS SAN FRANCISCO WOULD BENEFIT FROM NEWSPAPER
MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (Eds: Filed in the ``f'' and ``a'' categories.)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By LANCE WILLIAMS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner SAN FRANCISCO _ The proposed merger of the city's two daily
<TEXT>
newspapers would benefit consumers by boosting competition in Bay
Area suburbs, the Hearst Corporation said in defense of its plan to
consolidate the San Francisco Examiner and San Francisco Chronicle.
<P>
   In pleadings filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court, Hearst,
owner of the Examiner, asked a judge to dismiss an anti-merger
lawsuit filed by Clint Reilly, an unsuccessful candidate for mayor
in last year's election.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based media company said its plan to buy the
competing Chronicle fully complied with federal antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly filed a lawsuit Tuesday against Hearst and the Chronicle
Publishing Co., contending that Hearst's plan to buy the Chronicle
for a reported $660 million and merge it with the afternoon
Examiner would result in higher advertising and subscription rates
and thus harm consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, a former political consultant who finished fourth in the
mayor's race, asked the court to block the merger as a violation of
federal antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst's proposed purchase of the Chronicle was announced in
August and has been under review by the antitrust division of the
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Hearst Corporation told the court that Reilly
was wrong when he claimed the merger would mean higher prices for
readers and advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1965, the Examiner and the Chronicle have been jointly
setting their subscription and advertising prices under terms of
the Joint Operating Agreement through which the papers share
printing and business operations. Hearst argued that the merger
would actually boost competition among news outlets in the Bay
Area.
</P>
<P>
   The merger ``will benefit consumers by increasing competition
between the Chronicle and other print and electronic media,
including such major firms as Knight-Ridder, which owns the San
Jose Mercury News and the Contra Costa Times,'' wrote Gary Halling,
a lawyer for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly's attorney, Joseph M. Alioto, could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a century, the Examiner and the Chronicle were
morning rivals. But in 1965, the two newspapers contended that it
was impossible for both of them to survive without relief from
head-to-head competition.
</P>
<P>
   They entered into a joint operating agreement under which the
Examiner switched to afternoon publication. The two newspapers
maintain separate news staffs and compete for stories, but share
business operations and profits. The agreement is set to expire in
2005.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Area's newspaper market has undergone huge changes since
1965, in part because of the rise of strong suburban newspapers,
including those published by Knight-Ridder, the nation's second
biggest newspaper chain.
</P>
<P>
   Last year when the Thieriot family, which owns Chronicle
Publishing, decided to sell its media properties, Hearst said it
would buy the Chronicle and merge it with the Examiner unless a
buyer for the afternoon newspaper was found.
</P>
<P>
   In its legal response, Hearst said it had had no luck finding a
buyer for the Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Through a broker, the company contacted 81 prospective buyers,
but found no one interested in publishing an afternoon paper in the
city, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The morning Chronicle has an average daily circulation of about
484,000, while the Examiner's circulation is about 120,000.
</P>
<P>
   Since the sale was announced, Mayor Willie Brown and other city
officials have said they oppose the merger. District Attorney
Terence Hallinan has threatened an antitrust lawsuit of the sort
Reilly filed.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst has interests in publishing, broadcasting, syndication
and the Internet. It owns daily newspapers in Albany, N.Y.;
Edwardsville, Ill.; Bad Axe and Midland, Mich.; Seattle; and in the
Texas cities of Beaumont, Houston, Laredo, Midland, Plainview and
San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Chronicle Publishing owns several television stations as well as
the Telegram &AMP; Gazette in Worcester, Mass., and the Bloomington
Pantagraph in Illinois.

WINONA RYDER'S BROODING LENDS CONTINUITY TO `GIRL, INTERRUPTED' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is Winona Ryder ever better than when she's brooding?
</P>
<P>
   She may have earned two Oscar nominations for her wistful
performances in ``Little Women'' and ``The Age of Innocence'' but
she didn't have nearly as much grave appeal as she did in Tim
Burton's ``Beetlejuice'' or, now, in ``Girl, Interrupted,'' which
is based on Susanna Kaysen's 1993 bestselling autobiographical book
about her descent into depression and illness.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe darkness suits Ryder, because she's certainly the glue
that keeps all the chaotic, manic co-characters from spiraling out
of control in ``Girl, Interrupted.'' As directed by James Mangold,
who made the gritty dramas ``Heavy'' and ``Copland,'' there are two
speeds to this film _ fast and furious or downbeat and slow.
</P>
<P>
   And while it's no ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' or even on
a par with Frank Perry's fragile porcelain puzzle, ``David and
Lisa,'' the film has its strengths. It looks as desaturated as a
newsreel and captures the tone and idealism of an era _ the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Susanna washes a bottle of aspirin down with as much vodka,
cavalierly saying afterward that ``she had a headache.'' The move
lands her in Claymoore Hospital, an elite Boston mental
establishment where she is diagnosed with borderline personality
disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, she meets the charismatic but sociopathic Lisa (Angelina
Jolie), who, on the surface is strong and wild, but beneath as
frightened and vulnerable as the rest of the patients on the floor.
Initially Susanna lingers beneath Lisa's seemingly magical aura,
breaking the rules and creating havoc, but after a tragedy occurs,
Susanna begins to repair her life by confronting her demons, apathy
and anger _ and writing it all down in a journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girl, Interrupted'' tackles so much that it skims the surface
of mental illness ``chic,'' trivializing the plight of the young
women and conveniently presenting an array of patients diagnosed
with a smorgasboard of illnesses _ anorexia, pathological lying,
eating disorders, sociopathy and plain old human frailty. It comes
off as a schoolgirl's doomed romantic notion that feels more
old-fashioned than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   And the highs and lows nearly sink a film that's not quite sure
what it wants to convey and never finds its emotional pitch. For
all its sombre heaviness and reverential gravity, it never quite
pulls all the elements and themes together despite Ryder's
thankfully downplayed turn and an exceptional bit by Brittany
Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   As Daisy, Murphy is heartbreakingly frail, tough and brittle as
a young patient who is discharged from Claymoore and ultimately
falls to pieces when she discovers a hard truth about the world:
life outside the four confining walls of the hospital is no
different and her supposed independence is little more than a thin
veil that keeps her self-delusion and illusion at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Girl, Interrupted. Directed by James Mangold. Written by
Mangold, Lisa Loomer, Anna Hamilton Phelan. Cast: Winona Ryder,
Angelina Jolie, Whoopi Goldberg, Vanessa Redgrave. Columbia
Pictures. 125 minutes. Rated R for language, violence.

`42 UP': REAL-LIFE TALE HAS SEASONED ANOTHER 7 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Apted is one of those rare directors who can jump back
and forth between the feature and documentary film worlds with
ease.
</P>
<P>
   He not only directed ``Coal Miner's Daughter,'' which scored a
best picture Oscar nomination, and the newest James Bond film,
``The World Is Not Enough,'' but also the politically impassioned
``Incident at Oglala,'' which focused on the plight of imprisoned
activist Leonard Peltier. In 1994, he ventured to China to make
``Moving the Mountain,'' which looked back at the Tiananmen Square
Massacre through the eyes of five students.
</P>
<P>
   ``42 Up'' is the sixth installment in a Granada TV series that
originated in 1962 with ``7 Up,'' which took 14 7-year-old English
children from various classes and temperaments and asked questions
about their families and aspirations. The series has followed them
at 7-year intervals (``7+7 Up,'' ``21 Up,'' ``28 Up,'' ``35 Up'')
through the course of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fascinating premise that certainly appeals to the voyeur
in us all; so fascinating in fact, that Apted acted as executive
producer on ``14 Up in America'' and ``Age 14 in Russia'' and
Australian director Gillian Armstrong began her own series,
``Smokes and Lollies,'' following it up with ``14's Good, 18's
Better'' and ``Not 14 Again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``42 Up'' proves that truth is far more interesting than
fiction. Eleven of the original kids agreed to participate in this
edition and Apted delves into their marriages, affairs, children,
ambitions, feelings about the series, and disappointments. He
intercuts footage from the previous age levels and ultimately
provides a concise history of each person so the viewer doesn't
have to see the other films to glean a consistent and well-rounded
sense of who each is and how, from the first glimpse in 1962, their
destinies were already forged and formed.
</P>
<P>
   ``42 Up'' is difficult to weigh and rate precisely because it
deals with real life and real people. As Symon, the ex-foster care
boy, shyly notes, ``We're not talking about a movie. We're talking
about life.'' And ``42 Up'' proves, as these once-optimistic
children now enter middle age, that life doesn't always turn out
the way we hoped when we were young and believed we had all the
time in the world to alter the course of destiny.
</P>
<P>
   42 Up. Documentary directed by Michael Apted. First Run
Features. 135 minutes. Not rated.

   &UR; RETRANSMITTING FOR THOSE WHO MAY HAV MISSED. &QL; 
Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule book reviews:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``NAT KING COLE'' &QL; 
By Daniel Mark Epstein (FSG, $27) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `The kid was wearing a light green gabardine suit that draped
his long, slender frame so loosely it looked like the first
high-note blast of a trumpet might blow his coat off.'' Nat Cole
was 16 then, shy but bold enough to know how good he was. It's this
image of the young Cole in 1935, about to go up against Earl Hines
in the ``Battle of Rhythm'' in Chicago's Savoy Ballroom that begins
Epstein's biography. Cole died of cancer when he was 45, yet his
story is rich enough for several lives. There were his formative
years in Chicago as what Epstein calls ``a kitten on the keys.''
There were his marriages and infidelities, bad business decisions,
and troubles with the IRS. There was the racial tension that
buffeted his career (in 1956, he was attacked onstage by White
assailants during a performance in Birmingham, Ala.). And there
were Cole's affability and pragmatism, which helped him skirt
racial politics, court a White audience, and make an amazing
crossover from jazz to popular (and frequently schlocky) music.
Epstein creates an engaging portrait of this romantic figure in
American music. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``IN THE GLOAMING'' &QL; 
By Alice Elliott Dark (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $23) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In ``Triage,'' a mother and her adult daughter pursue an uneasy
truce as they jockey for position in each other's lives. In ``The
Tower,'' an aging bachelor falls for a young woman whose background
hints at a very unpleasant surprise. In ``Dreadful Language,'' a
woman moves through youthful rebellion to true love and on to
sorrow and resignation. But the big draw in this story collection
is the title piece, which was published in ``The New Yorker'' in
1994, made into a HBO film starring Glenn Close, and chosen by John
Updike for ``The Best American Short Stories of the Century.'' ``In
the Gloaming'' is a story about conversations _ they take place
always at twilight, the time called ``the gloaming'' _ between a
woman and her 33-year-old son, who is dying of AIDS. With austere
precision, Dark charts the mother's heart as she comes to know both
her son and herself and as she begins to understand that these
daily talks are her dying child's way of returning her love to her.
It's a wonderful story _ moving, understated and as true as the
emotional secrets it unveils.
</P>
<P>
   ``100 BEST ALBUM COVERS: THE STORIES BEHIND THE SLEEVES'' &QL; 
By Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell (DK, $19.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``At 4 a.m. every morning for a week, three adults and two
children were sprayed silver and gold from head to toe and driven
from the hotel to the location to await a glorious sunrise that
never happened,'' write Thorgerson and Powell. It rained, it was
cold, it was boring, and after the makeup ran out, they had to use
car paint, which they removed with turpentine. In the end, the
adult models were dumped (they used just the naked children, a
brother and sister who had already appeared nude in a Japanese
version of ``Alice in Wonderland'') and the sunrise was faked, but
the album cover for Led Zeppelin's ``Houses of the Holy'' is
memorable enough to appear here, a full 26 years later. Also
included are the stories behind the covers for Santana's
``Abraxas,'' the Grateful Dead's ``Aoxomoxoa,'' Big Brother &AMP; the
Holding Company's ``Cheap Thrills'' and John Lennon and Yoko Ono's
``Two Virgins'' and many more.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``FLU'' &QL; 
By Gina Kolata (FSG, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The flu of 1918 came in two waves. The first showed up in the
spring, bringing its victims chills and fevers but rarely lasting
more than three days. It was, Kolata writes, ``banal, and easily
forgotten.'' In September, however, it came back with a vengeance,
and this time it was a killer that altered countless lives.
Children were orphaned, families were destroyed. Thousands of
people die horribly. More than 25 percent of the United States
population became ill, and between 20 million and 100 million
people died worldwide. If a similar plague were to strike today, it
would kill more people in a single year than heart disease,
cancers, strokes, pulmonary disease, AIDS and Alzheimer's disease
combined. But is this possible? Are authorities prepared to fight
the outbreak of another virus with such mysterious and deadly
power? Kolata, a science writer for the ``New York Times,'' looks
at the history of the 1918 flu and at the lessons it offers for
averting a similar disaster today. It's fascinating but sobering
reading _ if you feel a chill coming on, save it for another day.  &QL;

CLOONEY SAYS NO TRUTH IN RUMOR THAT HE'S ON CALL FOR `ER' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Contrary to rumor, George Clooney says no one
has asked him to return to ``ER,'' not even for the episode when
Julianna Margulies leaves the series later this season. Margulies
plays nurse Carol Hathaway, who now has twins fathered by Clooney's
character, Doug Ross.
</P>
<P>
   Clooney says reports of his being offered $2 million per episode
are complete fabrications of wishful thinkers. ``I have never been
asked,'' he told TV critics this week, ``(but) I'd like to go on
the record as saying, `I'd go back for $2 million an episode.' I'm
not an idiot.'' But he also said he wouldn't return unless there
was a compelling reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that it's necessarily smart for me to come back
for one scene and, you know, scoop Julianna up and walk out. ...
Julianna leaving will be a big enough story line, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   The actor is more intent these days on a project for CBS that
recalls the early days of television. He is producing and will star
in a live black-and-white remake of the 1964 film ``Fail-Safe'' on
April 9 with his pal and ``ER'' co-star, Noah Wyle. Walter
Bernstein, who wrote the original novel and the 1964 screenplay of
the Cold War thriller, is writing the new script.
</P>
<P>
   Clooney hopes the ``Fail-Safe'' film will be more of an artistic
success than the live episode of ``ER'' he instigated a couple of
years ago, because the film's sets will be constructed from scratch
with a live broadcast in mind, rather than adapted to accommodate
something they weren't designed for.
</P>
<P>
   _Besides ``City of Angels'' CBS will make room in its midseason
schedule for two more series. One is ``Falcone,'' the long-awaited
hourlong drama based on the life of Joseph Pistone, the undercover
FBI agent who inspired the film ``Donnie Brasco.'' Jason Gedrick
plays Pistone, who poses as a brash young mobster named Joe
Falcone. The other series is ``Grapevine,'' a half-hour romantic
comedy that may ring a bell with some viewers. Six episodes of the
series aired in the summer of 1992, and creator David Frankel has
been waiting all these years to bring it back. Kristy Swanson,
Steven Eckholdt, George Eads and David Sutcliffe star.
</P>
<P>
   On the miniseries side, CBS's winter/spring slate includes a
little crime, a little sex and a little of that old-time religion.
``Perfect Murder, Perfect Town,'' a film about the JonBenet Ramsey
murder case starring Ronny Cox and Marg Helgenberger as John and
Patsy Ramsey, airs Feb. 27 and March 1; ``Sally Hemings: An
American Scandal'' has Sam Neill as Thomas Jefferson and Carmen
Ejogo as his slave and mistress, Sally Hemings, airing Feb. 13 and
16; and ``Jesus'' features Jeremy Sisto as Jesus Christ, Jacqueline
Bisset as the Virgin Mary and Debra Messing as Mary Magdalene,
airing in May.
</P>
<P>
   _Steven Bochco on the state of minority opportunities at the
major networks: ``I may get taken to task for this, but I don't see
an overt, rabid racism on the part of networks. I see a kind of
institutional laziness, a kind of ennui, if you will, that results
in a lack of diversity in hiring.''

THE PINOCHET PRECEDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The majesty of the law was on display when Britain found Chile's
erstwhile dictator, General Augusto Pinochet, medically unfit to
stand trial in Spain for crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Four highly qualified specialists conducted seven hours of
medical exams and concluded that the health of the 84-year-old
Pinochet had declined markedly last fall. The interior minister of
Britain's Labor government, Jack Straw, said the examining doctors
reached conclusions that were ``unequivocal and unanimous.'' Straw
is expected to refuse Spain's request for Pinochet's extradition
and to allow him to return home to Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of the Chileans, Spaniards, and Americans who were
tortured and murdered after Pinochet's 1973 putsch will doubtless
feel that the tyrant has been permitted to elude the law. Human
rights organizations, too, may rue Britain's decision as a
desolating example of the impunity that criminals wielding state
power have enjoyed all too often in the past century.
</P>
<P>
   But two significant principles were affirmed in the dramatic
case of Pinochet. Britain's highest judicial authority, the Law
Lords of the House of Lords, ruled that Pinochet could not be
exempt from prosecution for crimes against humanity merely because
he had acted as a head of state. In this way the British legal
system established a Pinochet precedent: There is no such thing as
sovereign immunity for crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even more telling is the emblematic meaning of the due
process accorded Pinochet in Britain. The ailing tyrant was judged
by a truly independent judiciary. He was represented by counsel of
his choice, and when one of his judges was believed to have a
potential conflict of interest, Pinochet was granted a new hearing
before new judges. At the end of a meticulously fair process, he
received a mercy that is inherent in the law.
</P>
<P>
   There was no such mercy for the men and women who were tortured
and killed while Pinochet ruled Chile.

AMERICAN DESPERATION AND THE FIRING OF CHAN GAILEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Old Henry David Thoreau certainly had it right about that
``quiet desperation'' that characterizes the lives of most men.
</P>
<P>
   I became more convinced of that than ever after seeing and
hearing the surreal goings-on at Valley Ranch late Tuesday
afternoon and the post-mortems of those proceedings later.
</P>
<P>
   The firing of Dallas Cowboys coach Chan Gailey was a byproduct
of that mass phenomenon. Make no mistake about it: Gailey deserved
it. Based upon some of the abominable calls he made in crucial
situations, one could make a good argument that he should not have
been allowed to finish the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   But what, you ask, has Gailey's failure as a Cowboys coach got
to do with Thoreau?
</P>
<P>
   Simply this: He failed to provide a huge percentage of the
people who live in North Texas, or who regard the Dallas Cowboys
from afar as ``America's Team,'' with a steady jolt of release from
the grip of the desperation of their humdrum daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   Having a winning hometown sports franchise can do that for
people _ even those who are not real sports fans. The exhilaration
is contagious. It carries over into every phase of community life _
a tonic, an addiction.
</P>
<P>
   A win by the local football team on Sunday takes the blues out
of Monday, and the warm feeling lasts the whole week. Winning the
Super Bowl can have a monthslong time-release effect.
</P>
<P>
   Folks in Fort Worth-Dallas have become greatly accustomed to
that kind of vicarious antidote to quiet desperation. Many of them
have suffered painful withdrawal pangs because of their team's
lackluster performance in 1998 and its 1999 disaster.
</P>
<P>
   In some cities, an 8-9 season would be acceptable; in Fort
Worth-Dallas, it's intolerable. Someone had to pay. If not Gailey,
who? And after all, he deserved it, although not by himself.
</P>
<P>
   There is real anger out there. Some of the sports talk-show
performers are capturing that mood, feeding upon it and spewing it
back with amplified vituperation.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these mouthy vicarious coaches and sports franchise
owners have taken on the ferocity of Old Testament prophets,
condemning, ridiculing and offering inane advice.
</P>
<P>
   In their way, they provide some ventilation of frustration for
masses who have no way to voice their impotent rage.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, sports fanaticism is not the only means that people
use to escape vicariously from quiet desperation.
Non-sports-related television offers legions of avenues of escape.
Whatever strikes one's fancy, from soap opera sentimentality to
greed-teasing game shows to thrill-a-minute action programs to
gory, desensitizing violence to graphic sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   And one can travel almost anywhere on the tube, from the source
of the Nile to the North Pole.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever television can do, the movies can do bigger, and
complement it with the added effect of sharing a vicarious event
with strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Movie stars have become the modern equivalent of the fickle and
exuberant gods, goddesses, nymphs and satyrs of Greek and Roman
mythology. Their lives and foibles provide a continuing stream of
grist for the print and broadcast scandal mills.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that mix the fingertip power of virtual living and
amusement on line, and the conformist behavior (like jogging) that
people do primarily because they see others doing it, and there
would appear to be no reason for anyone to be bored.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, millions are bored. Modern Americans are the most
overamused people in the history of the planet, and yet they derive
no lasting satisfaction from their amusements.
</P>
<P>
   That's not entirely because most of them do not work at jobs
that give them real satisfaction. After all, if one gets much
gratification from any activity, it can't be considered work.
</P>
<P>
   It goes deeper than that. The real reason is that Americans are
constantly being told that they need more stimulation to feel
really alive. They need that earth-shaking love affair portrayed in
the movies. They need wealth, fame. They need to score a touchdown!
</P>
<P>
   And if they can't score a touchdown themselves, then the next
best thing is to watch someone else do it and identify with him. So
if Chan Gailey can't provide the leadership to make the Cowboys
score the touchdowns that the fans need to see to get them through
the week ... well, ``Goodbye, Chan.''
</P>
<P>
   I, too, say ``good riddance'' as far as Gailey's firing is
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   But I know that I, like many others, allow such vicarious
thrills to matter to me too much when there could be so much more
lasting satisfaction to be found by sitting before a pond of
slow-moving water and quietly drowning my sense of desperation in
its depths.

REAL WORLD OF `CITY OF ANGELS' NEEDS A SHOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steven Bochco says if ``City of Angels'' fails, it will be a
serious setback for minority-produced, minority-acted programming
on the major networks, no matter what the nets are doing to assuage
the NAACP and other groups that want their color TV a little more
colorful, a little more reflective of the real world.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Bochco is right, simply because there aren't a
half-dozen other shows out there with crews and casts composed
mainly of minorities. But his suggestion that we'll all be sorry if
this noble endeavor falters sort of makes him the biggest travel
agent for guilt trips this side of my mom. It's as if he's saying:
``Watch it or else.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one way to make must-see TV, but we'd all be better
served if Bochco and his co-creators, Paris Barclay and Nicholas
Wootton, had delivered a better debut. Its relative weakness may be
precisely why Bochco is beating the social-significance drum so
steadily. Sunday's premiere episode of ``City of Angels'' is
polished, but it lacks the raw intensity of other Bochco shows like
``NYPD Blue,'' ``L.A. Law,'' ``Hill Street Blues,'' even ``Murder
One.'' Pacing is languorous _ closer to ``Chicago Hope'' than
``ER'' _ and anyone who remembers ``St. Elsewhere'' will quickly
realize that one of the show's key characters, the hospital itself,
seems underused in ``City of Angels.''
</P>
<P>
   This may all change as we get to know the staff and the quirks
of Angels of Mercy Hospital, but first impressions can be harder to
shake than the flu. And the first impression of ``City of Angels''
is that it's a better-than-average show that warrants another
visit, but which could also benefit from crisper direction and a
more passionate sense of what it's trying to be.
</P>
<P>
   The estimable Blair Underwood stands out as the acting chief of
surgery, Dr. Ben Turner, a gifted professional dedicated to quality
medical care for all. Turner's considerable zeal is matched by the
duplicity of hospital CEO Ron Harris (Michael Warren) and the
mysteriousness of Edwin O'Malley (Robert Morse), chairman of the
city's board of supervisors. But Vivica A. Fox, as the hospital's
new medical director who must deal regularly with all three men,
falls short of a convincing portrayal. Fox may grow in the role as
her character, Dr. Lillian Price, grows in the job, but for a woman
trying to impart lofty standards to an inner-city hospital
struggling to keep its accreditation, Dr. Price exhibits less
emotion than a patient under anesthesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``City of Angels'' may yet be the sort of program that becomes
the next water-cooler show for millions of Americans, but right now
it could use a shot of adrenaline. Stat.
</P>
<P>
   City of Angels. One-hour drama series about a county hospital
struggling to survive in inner-city Los Angeles. Starring Blair
Underwood, Vivica A. Fox, Michael Warren, Robert Morse, Hill
Harper, Phil Buckman, T.E. Russell, Viola Davis and Maya Rudolph.
Series premieres Sunday on CBS, moves to Wednesdays on Jan. 19.

`THE EDGE OF THE WORLD': CRAGGY OBJECT OF CONQUEST AND, FINALLY,
EXTINCTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Edge of the World'' was shown as part of last year's New
York Film Festival. Following are excerpts from Stephen Holden's
review, which appeared in The New York Times on Sept. 25. The film
opens Friday in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at Michael Powell's 1937 film, ``The Edge of the
World,'' you would hardly guess that this early work by the great
British director emanated from the same hand that 11 years later
gave us the balletic opulence of ``The Red Shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Exquisitely photographed in black and white, the film gazes with
such concentrated awe upon the steep, craggy landscape of Foula, a
remote, wind-and-rain-battered Scottish island in the North Sea,
that certain sequences produce a sense of vertigo.
</P>
<P>
   Those dizzying sequences, of men clawing up a sheer rock face
barehanded or lowering themselves from high, jagged cliffs on
frayed ropes, are more heart-stopping than 90 percent of the
daredevil stunts concocted for contemporary action-adventure films.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond their technical virtuosity, what lends them a visceral
power is the film's implacably gloomy vision of man versus nature.
Here there is just no contest. Instead of Hollywood's sweating,
straining beefcake gods conquering the physical world, these
climbers are tiny human flies clinging perilously to life in an
indifferent, punishing environment that commands infinitely more
force than the sinew of Hollywood's bulkiest superhero.
</P>
<P>
   Only a small part of the film, in a pristine new 35-mm print,
deals with such hair-raising adventure. When it is exploring the
livelihood and customs of the islanders, the movie assumes an
anthropological tone, following the inhabitants into church,
overhearing their casual conversations and observing a subsistence
way of life that revolves around fishing and herding sheep.
</P>
<P>
   On top of everything, ``The Edge of the World'' tells a romantic
story of star-crossed love, a child born out of wedlock and feuding
families in a fiercely puritanical society. If the love story seems
dated, with the camera shamelessly monumentalizing the actors'
faces, the shots are beautifully composed in a high-romantic
late-1930s style. And Belle Chrystal and Niall McGinnis, as the
lovers, Ruth Manson and Andrew Gray, convey a passion that the
stylization doesn't entirely undercut.
</P>
<P>
   But what finally makes ``The Edge of the World'' more than a
period piece and an intriguing indication of Powell's potential is
its profoundly sad vision of a proud, tiny self-sustaining society
struggling to stay independent, then finally giving up.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the film we visit the now-deserted island.
The rest of the tale is told in flashback, with the love story's
conflicts mirroring the larger debate among the islanders about
their future. (When Ruth's twin brother opposes Andrew's vision of
the island's future, the two men risk their lives in a
rock-climbing contest.)
</P>
<P>
   The final exodus, which finds the islanders gravely filing onto
a boat, leaving many of their pets behind, is as sobering an ending
as you'll find in any film. For eventually civilizations, like all
of us, run out of steam and die. &QL;

`THE TERRORIST': A GUERRILLA GROWS UP DURING A MISSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Malli (Ayesha Dharkar), the title character of Santosh Sivan's
remarkable new film, is a 19-year-old who lives in a guerrilla camp
in the South Indian jungle. Aside from her occasional execution of
a traitor and the constant threat of a government ambush, her life
seems in many respects perfectly ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   She could almost be the heroine of a sweet, wholesome Hollywood
coming-of-age story. She and her girlfriends engage in friendly
banter, brush each other's hair and do their best to ignore the
appraising looks of the local boys. When Malli is chosen for a
suicide mission, her peers respond with envy and admiration, as if
she had been elected prom queen.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of a rhinestone tiara, she is granted the rare
privilege of lunch with the Leader (Sonu Sisupal), the faceless
adult in command of this army of children, and then sent out to
assassinate a politician referred to only as the VIP.
</P>
<P>
   Malli's cause is never specified, but ``The Terrorist'' was
suggested by a very real event: the suicide bombing that killed
Rajiv Gandhi, the Indian prime minister, in 1991. In spite of the
political volatility of its subject matter, the film is less
interested in politics than in psychology.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to have been inspired by a basic, exquisitely difficult
question: what kind of a person would do something like that? And
by choosing to answer the question as literally and painstakingly
as possible, Sivan has accomplished something extraordinary: he has
given political extremism a human face.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean this metaphorically. Ms. Dharkar's unforgettable
face, with her wide, full mouth and enormous dark eyes, appears in
nearly every frame, often filling most of the screen, as if we
might be able to find our way into Malli's mind through her pores.
</P>
<P>
   At times Sivan's taste for extremely tight close-ups _ and his
tendency to decorate Malli's face with raindrops and tears _ feels
annoyingly arty, as does his habit of filling the soundtrack with
heavy breathing and portentous music.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part he tells Malli's story with subtlety and
simplicity, resisting the temptations of melodrama and ideological
point-scoring. He is helped by the astonishing Ms. Dharkar, who
manages to register, almost entirely through nuances of gesture and
facial expression, her character's complex inner transformation.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the movie Malli exists in a state of
perverse innocence. She inhabits a universe in which martyrdom
appears to be not only an exalted ambition but a reasonable career
choice. Her father, we learn, was a well-known nationalist poet,
and her older brother is described by a comrade in tones of
veneration as ``the first to consume cyanide and die for the
movement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Leader, in his lunchtime pep talk, tells Malli he wants her
to become a ``thinking bomb,'' and she seems, from the start, to be
quite thoughtful, even as she matter-of-factly accepts her own
annihilation.
</P>
<P>
   But the most dangerous thing about a thinking bomb, at least
from the Leader's point of view, is that it has the potential to
defuse itself. And as she moves closer to her fate, Malli begins to
have second thoughts, not about the cause or her comrades but about
the logic of martyrdom.
</P>
<P>
   In a less rigorous movie, Malli's passage from unwavering belief
to agonized doubt might have been hammered home through overwrought
speeches and tearful confrontations. But Sivan allows her zeal to
unravel slowly and quietly, through her gradual, accidental
immersion in a world unlike the jungle bases in which she has spent
her life: the decidedly unheroic world of everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   When Malli arrives in the town where the assassination is
supposed to take place, she is lodged, under false pretenses, with
a farmer named Vasu (Parmeshwaran). At first Vasu seems like a
vain, lecherous old fool, dispensing demented parables (``Do you
know the story of the optimistic seed and the pessimistic seed?'')
and asking nosy questions.
</P>
<P>
   But in the course of Malli's sojourn _ four days that feel as
endless as the four days leading up to a foreordained death must
feel _ her perception of him, and ours, shifts.
</P>
<P>
   Vasu's life, a messy mixture of tragedy, absurdity and stoicism,
becomes the film's emblem of decency, and the relationship between
the farmer and the suicide bomber becomes its emotional core. And
the film, without stooping to political-thriller cliches, becomes
almost unbearably suspenseful, as we wonder whether Malli's new
self-knowledge _ her willingness to allow confusion into her life _
will prevent her from completing her mission. In presenting Malli's
dilemma, Sivan shows an ability to capture the texture of quotidian
reality _ to communicate both its exquisite beauty and terrible
fragility _ that recalls the work of Robert Bresson, or, closer to
home, Satyajit Ray.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Terrorist'' is the first feature that Sivan, one of
India's most respected cinematographers, has directed, so it is
perhaps premature to enlist him in such exalted company.
</P>
<P>
   The film was shot in 17 days (on locations in Kerala and
Madras), with a cast made up entirely of nonprofessional actors, on
a tiny budget. But there is nothing modest about the ambitions or
talent that ``The Terrorist'' displays. &QL;

THE BIG CHEESE THEORY IS A GOOD READ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA McUSIC 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A famous Jesuit once said that the only thing that stands
between humans and the truth is a story.
</P>
<P>
   That could easily be said of the book gracing the Top 10
bestsellers lists of The New York Times, Business Week and other
major publications, entitled ``Who Moved My Cheese? An A-Mazing Way
to Deal with Change in Your Work and in Your Life'' (G.P. Putman's
Sons, 96 pages, $19.95).
</P>
<P>
   Although far from complex theology, this book can trigger
profound thought through its use of a simple allegorical tale. It
seems to have moved entire corporations, as well as many people.
</P>
<P>
   It's written by Spencer Johnson, co-author of ``The One Minute
Manager'' and several other books, including a popular children's
series. Johnson has a medical degree, with internships at Harvard
Medical School and the Mayo Clinic, and worked for the company that
invented cardiac pacemakers.
</P>
<P>
   He is an international speaker and author whose books are
available in 26 languages.
</P>
<P>
   As he did in ``The One Minute Manager,'' Johnson has pared his
ideas to the bare bone in this book, making it easily read in an
hour or less. Nonetheless, readers may find themselves thinking
about it for days if not weeks after they have finished it.
</P>
<P>
   And then they will probably pass it on to coworkers, bosses and
clients. In a recent special edition, Johnson lists 100
corporations and organizations, from Anheuser Busch and AT&AMP;T to the
U.S. Army, Navy and Air Force, that have endorsed the book.
</P>
<P>
   I came to this book with skepticism, because every other
allegorical tale I've read that dealt with business fell flat. I
typically roll my eyes at the end of such books and wonder who
could ever get anything meaningful out of the story.
</P>
<P>
   But not this one. The story is so simple: two mice and two small
humans, or ``littlepeople,'' as Johnson calls them, in a maze
looking for cheese.
</P>
<P>
   The mice, not afflicted with emotion or overanalysis, fare well
in the maze, finding cheese and then moving on when a corridor
becomes empty.
</P>
<P>
   The littlepeople, despite their obvious superior intelligence,
have much more of a struggle. They initially find cheese but then
become far too complacent, so they not only cannot see their cheese
mound decline but, when it disappears, are completely terrified of
what lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ranted and raved at the injustice of it all,'' Johnson
writes. ``The littlepeople couldn't believe it. How could this have
happened? No one had warned them. It wasn't right. It was not the
way things were supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The braver of the two littlepeople goes through quite an odyssey
searching for new cheese, having to break down his fears of the
journey and of new experiences while facing hunger and exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   This littleperson, Haw, comes up with several truths along the
way to finding more cheese, which he writes on the walls of the
maze. Among them are:
</P>
<P>
   If you do not change, you can become extinct.
</P>
<P>
   What would you do if you weren't afraid?
</P>
<P>
   Smell the cheese often so you know when it is getting old.
</P>
<P>
   Noticing small changes early helps you adapt to the bigger
changes that are to come.
</P>
<P>
   You'll have to read the book to find out how the littlepeople
make out. (The mice, of course, find the new source of cheese
shortly after they exhausted the last one).
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also includes a story outside the story to begin and end
his cheese tale. This second story involves four people meeting at
a college reunion, all in different stages of work and personal
life. This group is introduced to the cheese story by one
schoolmate, who thought it might help them.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the book, all four react to different aspects of
the story and go away carrying its message. Although this part of
the book comes off a little more clumsily, it serves to get readers
into the mind-set of hearing a story and then thinking about it.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, the message is a powerful one, and it doesn't take
much insight or analysis to get it. That's why it has stayed on all
those bestseller lists since it came out.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The minimum requirement for Le Weekend New Yorkais
was about as basic as a crusty baguette.
</P>
<P>
   My French husband and I yearned for a Manhattan with a Gallic
accent _ a bistro perhaps where a petit caniche begs for sugar
cubes below a polished bar, or a brasserie where the mood is
casual, the air is more smoke than oxygen and the frites are served
with mustard and the songs of Serge Gainsbourg.
</P>
<P>
   We never found the sugar-starved poodle beside the bar. But we
did learn how to satisfy the inexplicable urge to listen daily to
``La Marseillaise,'' the French national anthem, courtesy of the
French Embassy's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   A weekend search for La Vie a New York is rather like hurtling
through a dizzying blur of Metro stops. With such a richness of
traditional and unconventional French cultural offerings, a tourist
can visit a Museum of Modern Art exhibition of Monet and Cezanne
landscapes one day and head the next to Claude Leveque's ``Stigmata
'99'' installation, a disco-inspired staircase of flickering
crimson light and mirrors at the PS 1 Contemporary Art Center in
Long Island City, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Determined Francophiles can rise at dawn to the latest Radio
France Internationale news reports from Paris on 91.5 FM and drift
to sleep to the hypnotic drone of 24-hour TV5 satellite programming
featuring French shows like ``Bouillon de Culture'' or ``Paris Chic
Choc.''
</P>
<P>
   But the freshest serenade comes from a modern-day group of
French explorers who have come to New York to disseminate the
dernier cri in European music, a quirky minimalist electronic style
that is sometimes called Le French Touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been here for two years and there are so many French
people it's getting scary,'' said Mary-Noelle Dana, an expatriate
Parisian and self-described ``settler'' who organizes periodic
showcases for French musicians and disc jockeys at the Knitting
Factory in lower Manhattan's Tribeca section.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the French Touch generation that's moving in,'' she said.
``We're between 20 and 30. I think that without getting spiritual
it's a question of energy. There's a huge unemployment problem in
France, and the young generation has a hard time in the
entertainment industry. And after a while you want to stop waiting
and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Renaud, 32, moved from Paris to New York about 10 years
ago and took up the accordion and microphone to perform a mix of
retro romance songs ranging from Edith Piaf to the medieval.
Wearing hooded form-fitting gowns, she presents what she considers
a modern take on cabaret inspired by futuristic films like ``Blade
Runner'' and ``The Fifth Element.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Renaud makes a weekly circuit of small clubs with names like
the Torch Club, on the Lower East Side, or La Luncheonette, in
Chelsea. On one slow Monday night, her ethereal soprano filled the
Torch Club, a warm, uncluttered space with textured walls, soaring
ceilings and glowing sconces that is so discreet there is nothing
to identify it from the street beyond its metal doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess being away from my country I have rediscovered my
culture,'' Ms. Renaud said. ``I started the accordion about three
years ago. Arriving in New York, the natural thing was to sing
French songs, and I felt free to do it: people expected me to sing
those songs. The other advantage in being in New York is that there
were not many people doing this kind of music, and so it was easier
for me to work here. I find that there's a different energy in New
York in the sense that people tend to take more risks.''
</P>
<P>
   `It's Really Burning'
</P>
<P>
   In late November the Knitting Factory organized its second
annual French Touch Festival, a regular series supported with seed
money from the Cultural Services of the French Embassy in New York
that seeks to promote French artists in the United States. PS 1
also was a host to French disc jockeys in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   There is a private circuit of clubs that regularly feature
Parisian-style dance music, notably Twilo, a cavernous club in
Chelsea. On Friday night, Jan. 14, it will present the latest event
in a series called ``Respect Is Burning.'' The gatherings, which
take place bimonthly (the next is March 17), are an outgrowth of
the ``Respect'' parties that used to be held regularly in Paris at
the Rex Club, a techno night spot next to the opulent Grand Rex
Theater on the Right Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it `Respect Is Burning' because the music would be so
crazy that we would say `it's really burning tonight,''' said Neil
Aline, a 23-year-old Parisian expatriate who has settled in the
East Village and makes his living as a disc jockey and concert
promoter.
</P>
<P>
   Like other fans of Le French Touch music, Aline stretches for
adjectives to characterize the sound, which exports the creme of
disc jockeys, programmers and producers working in France. ``It's
house music with a really funky touch,'' said Aline. ``It's
electronic-sounding but soulful at the same time. The bottom line
is that it's house music, but house music that never sounded like
this before.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowds that come to these events at the Knitting Factory,
Twilo or Izzy Bar are a mix of Americans and French expatriates.
Performers address the audience in English, but participants
respond with cries of ``Allez! Allez!''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very curious about electronic music because they
don't have as much as we do in Europe,'' said Adele Jacques, who
arrived from Paris a few months ago to sing at clubs like the
Knitting Factory or Fez. ``The reaction has actually been pretty
good. I was very astonished because they don't understand what
we're saying, but they like the music.''
</P>

   Balzac, par E-Mail
</P>
<P>
   Many of the French cultural events in New York are carefully
nurtured by the French government through subsidies and aid from
the Cultural Services of the French Embassy, which amounted to
about $500,000 last year in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The French Embassy helped underwrite the Knitting Factory's Le
French Touch Festival in November. And it helped bring Leveque's
``Stigmata'' to PS 1, which is also the site of ``On Your Own
Time,'' an international show that includes the work of the painter
Roman Opalka. Since 1965 Opalka has been exploring the passage of
time on large canvases painted with numbers. In December the French
Ministry of Culture and Globecast France Telecom provided the
museum with live transmissions of Opalka, who apparently has
decided to keep counting to infinity.
</P>
<P>
   The French government also supports traditional offerings, like
a series of performances in February at the Church of Saint
Ignatius de Loyola on Park Avenue by Oliver Latry, the organist for
the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris. It is also trying in a
low-key way to promote French literature in New York by organizing
lectures and cocktail parties for visiting authors whose new works
have been translated and published in the United States, among them
Jean-Paul Kauffmann, author of ``Black Room at Longwood,'' a
bittersweet exploration of Napoleon's final years in exile as a
prisoner of the British on the island of St. Helena.
</P>
<P>
   For those who prefer their French literature in French, there
are stores to satisfy the urge. A traditional choice is the
Librairie de France at Rockefeller Center, where basic children's
titles can be $20 or more. But it's also possible to buy digital
books by e-mail in minutes from Paris, where a new Internet upstart
called Zero Heure is publishing classic titles, original works and
contemporary books from other French publishers. The Web site _
www.00h00.com _ gives shoppers an easy way to test the purchasing
system with invitations to order free books. The electronic books,
ranging from about a dollar to $30, are cheaper than conventional
books, which can also be ordered from Zero Heure by mail.
</P>
<P>
   Le News Flash
</P>
<P>
   The links to Paris do not end with the Internet. Radio France
Internationale is on every morning at 6:30 on 91.5 FM, and Le
Journal de France 2 _ the daily evening news from Paris _ is
broadcast at 7 by WNYE on Channel 25. (The English subtitles
occasionally don't match the stories, but it can add to the
entertainment when a news anchor announces a breaking story while
the subtitles have her warbling '60s song lyrics.) A satellite dish
and a $10 subscription fee to TV5 USA will bring you 24 hours of
programming from French-speaking countries.
</P>
<P>
   Cable television also offers an assortment of French movies.
CUNY-TV on Channel 75, the station operated by the City University
of New York, is broadcasting French films with English subtitles on
Friday nights at 10 and Sunday afternoons at 3. Among the
lesser-known offerings is ``La Voie Est Libre,'' Stephane Clavier's
1998 film about a railroad employee who is laid off from his job
after 20 years only to become the main suspect in a strange hostage
crisis on a suburban railway.
</P>
<P>
   A French movie is shown several times every Tuesday at the
French Institute/Alliance Francaise, which also plans to present a
festival of short films from Jan. 24-26 grouped around themes like
youth and the bizarre. There is ``John,'' a short tale about a
Tarzan who has taken up residence in France, for example, and
``Gisele Kerozene,'' a contemporary story of a group of
``proto-punk'' witches embarked on a wild search for a magic skull.
Vive la difference.
</P>
<P>
   The Bistro Look
</P>
<P>
   For newly arrived expatriates, a circuit of informal French
bistros offer a fleeting taste of Paris. Some of the French
settlers effusively praise little restaurants like Jules in the
East Village, which often has live music or accordion brunches, and
Casimir, a bar bistro on Avenue B named for a bunny in an old
French television series.
</P>
<P>
   Casimir had the appropriate understated bistro look: exposed
brick walls, wooden cafe chairs, Charles Aznavour posters, and
anise-flavored Ricard served at the bar. My husband and I were less
impressed by a gum-chewing waitress who blew bubbles while serving
us French fries stacked inelegantly in a tin pail.

ARE GAME SHOWS SILLY OR INSIDIOUS? IS THAT YOUR FINAL ANSWER?

<P>
   ``Who has an itch,
</P>
<P>
   To be filthy rich?
</P>
<P>
   Who gives a hoot,
</P>
<P>
   For a lot of loot?,
</P>
<P>
   Who longs to live,
</P>
<P>
   A life of perfect ease?
</P>
<P>
   And be swamped by necessary luxuries?
</P>
<P>
   Who wants to be a millionaire?
</P>
<P>
   I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Songwriter Cole Porter might have traded riches for romance in
his 1956 tune, but in the waking hours of the 21st century,
millionaire-dom is hot.
</P>
<P>
   With the astounding success of the ABC game show ``Who Wants to
Be a Millionaire,'' prime-time television has morphed into a
virtual slot machine, promising ``ka-ching'' on every channel:
``Twenty One'' on NBC, ``Winning Lines'' on CBS, and the cutthroat
``Greed'' on Fox.
</P>
<P>
   The high-dollar TV quiz show has again transfixed the nation as
it did during the 1950s, when ``The $64,000 Question'' and ``Twenty
One'' were among the most popular shows on the air. But the reasons
behind the national infatuation aren't quite as clear-cut as they
were 45 years ago. And not everybody is as gleeful about game-show
mania as is ``Millionaire'' host Regis ``Is that your final
answer?'' Philbin.
</P>
<P>
   The question critics are raising: Is the quiz-show boom innocent
family entertainment or a symptom of Americans' ignorant bliss?
</P>
<P>
   The new game shows put a few twists on their '50s brethren: The
jackpots are gobs bigger (in the six- and seven-figure realm), the
sets are a whole lot hokier (think pseudo-spaceship), and the
questions are embarrassingly easier (''an insult'' is how 1956
``Twenty One'' contestant Herbert Stempel put it recently to The
Washington Post).
</P>
<P>
   But the formula works. ``Millionaire'' averaged more than 24
million viewers during its November run, and ``Greed'' is doubling
Fox's ratings on the nights it airs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fourteen thousand square miles of the polar ice cap melted
last year and all anyone can talk about is Regis Philbin,'' says
26-year-old Adam Werbach, an environmentalist and founder of Act
Now Productions, a San Francisco media company. Act Now's Web site,
www.smashregis.com, lets users literally bowl over the celeb by
dropping a money bag on his head. Why? ``We think Regis represents
everything wrong with television today,'' Werbach writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is drunk with its new wealth,'' he adds, but ``while
our cars may be shiny and our stocks may be booming ... there is a
void in the soul of America.'' A void we are hoping ``Millionaire''
can fill vicariously, Werbach contends.
</P>
<P>
   In November, New York Times columnist Frank Rich denounced the
new quiz shows as ``the giddiest manifestations yet of a culture
that offers a pornography of wealth almost everywhere you look.''
</P>
<P>
   In Rich's opinion, ``Millionaire's'' popularity springs from the
fact that so many people feel ``left out'' of the boom. ``Instead
of getting riled, have-not and have-not-so-much Americans are
looking for their own financial scores, especially quick scores,''
he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But can a slew of silly quiz shows really be deleterious to the
social fiber?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pretty innocent if somewhat moronic entertainment,''
says Robert Thompson, founding director of the Center for the Study
of Popular Television at Syracuse University.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson believes that the success of ``Millionaire'' and its
imitators owes more to the novelty than to an upsurge in greed or
ignorance. ``There's been this long detox period where we've had so
many cop shows and lawyer shows and sitcoms,'' he says. ``You've
got to be about 46 years old or older to remember when game shows
were a viable option on prime-time television.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Thompson notes, quiz shows fit into our hectic
schedules by requiring ``absolutely zero attention,'' unlike TV
shows with a narrative. The element of competition undoubtedly
generates excitement. And, with multiple-choice questions such as
``What two colors are an Oreo cookie?'' or, on the harder side,
``Which is the capital of Australia?'', the new game shows seem to
be crowing that anyone can be a millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the appeal is in (viewers thinking) `I could do that,
I knew that, I could have won a million dollars,''' says Horace
Newcomb, a professor of radio, television and film at the
University of Texas in Austin. ``But I don't see any corrupting
influence with this ... (The games shows are) not any less vapid
than any local TV news.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1950s quiz-show boom was America's second, following the
format's original radio debut in the '30s. But, for the average
viewer, the experience of watching the most popular post-war game
shows, ``The $64,000 Question'' and ``Twenty One,'' was anything
but an ego-booster. Take this actual ``$64,000 question,'' from
Thomas DeLong's 1991 book ``Quiz Craze: America's Infatuation with
Game Shows'' (Praeger):
</P>
<P>
   ``Name the opera Puccini never completed and the man who
finished it.'' Contestant Gino Prato, Italian immigrant and
shoe-repair man, knew both answers: ``Turandot'' and Franco Alfano.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those game shows (in the '50s) were really about showing
people who appeared to have an enormous body of information, which
we have to assume they gathered through a lifetime of paying
attention and studying and acquiring knowledge,'' Thompson says.
``And oftentimes you didn't win in a single night, so there was a
sense of earning'' over an extended period of time.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, the new breed of game show promotes its
immediate payoffs and its egalitarian, play-at-home appeal _ which
some people find entertaining and others a little insidious.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game shows are popular in the same way that some
high-school kids are popular, when they're really not threatening
to anyone,'' says Matthew Felling, media director for the Center
for Media and Public Affairs in Washington, D.C. ``These shows,
arguably made with the `duh' factor in mind, are not going to make
anybody feel stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   In Felling's opinion, the new game shows represent a dire
cultural drift. ``The quality of television is imperative to the
quality of society,'' he says. ``It sets the standard. When people
watch a show like `Jeopardy!,' they know what is expected, that the
bar is set so high in terms of knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as Werbach is concerned, Regis and ABC have given him and
other critical viewers a greater excuse to get involved with
television content.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is basically to start questioning what we're being
fed,'' says Werbach, who, at 23, became the youngest-ever president
of the Sierra Club. ``There's a lot of skill being wielded to make
us feel that we're having a wonderful home-family experience
watching nothing.''

 NEW YORK: tin pail.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   So we tried a restaurant recommended by Pierre Buhler, the
cultural counselor for the French Embassy on Fifth Avenue. His pick
was La Bonne Soupe on West 55th Street in midtown Manhattan, a busy
restaurant that seems to peak in energy around noon on Sunday and
settles down for more leisurely eating by 2:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Paul Picot, the owner, presides over the red-checked tables
from a spot at a small curving wooden bar, his half-glasses
dangling from his neck. He has not deserted the French custom of
mingling to chat with diners or occasionally offer a free digestif.
</P>
<P>
   La Bonne Soupe is the kind of place that attracts French Embassy
employees and the occasional Parisian celebrity. On the Sunday we
were there, the French television personality and actress Sophie
Favier attracted little attention when she took a table next to us
with her mother, 4-year-old daughter and a photographer who was
trailing her for Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
   But we found our true refuge _ sans poodle, helas _ when we
stumbled into Chez Bernard at West Broadway and Grand Street in
SoHo, a bistro with exposed brick walls, an old wine press
transformed into a lamp and wine bottles numbering in the
thousands.
</P>
<P>
   It passed the test when my husband and his visiting brother
ordered the charcuterie and settled into a kind of French reverie
that is difficult to spell: mmmm-mmmm-mmmm.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The minimum requirement for Le Weekend New Yorkais
was about as basic as a crusty baguette.
</P>
<P>
   My French husband and I yearned for a Manhattan with a Gallic
accent _ a bistro perhaps where a petit caniche begs for sugar
cubes below a polished bar, or a brasserie where the mood is
casual, the air is more smoke than oxygen and the frites are served
with mustard and the songs of Serge Gainsbourg.
</P>
<P>
   We never found the sugar-starved poodle beside the bar. But we
did learn how to satisfy the inexplicable urge to listen daily to
``La Marseillaise,'' the French national anthem, courtesy of the
French Embassy's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   A weekend search for La Vie a New York is rather like hurtling
through a dizzying blur of Metro stops. With such a richness of
traditional and unconventional French cultural offerings, a tourist
can visit a Museum of Modern Art exhibition of Monet and Cezanne
landscapes one day and head the next to Claude Leveque's ``Stigmata
'99'' installation, a disco-inspired staircase of flickering
crimson light and mirrors at the PS 1 Contemporary Art Center in
Long Island City, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Determined Francophiles can rise at dawn to the latest Radio
France Internationale news reports from Paris on 91.5 FM and drift
to sleep to the hypnotic drone of 24-hour TV5 satellite programming
featuring French shows like ``Bouillon de Culture'' or ``Paris Chic
Choc.''
</P>
<P>
   But the freshest serenade comes from a modern-day group of
French explorers who have come to New York to disseminate the
dernier cri in European music, a quirky minimalist electronic style
that is sometimes called Le French Touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been here for two years and there are so many French
people it's getting scary,'' said Mary-Noelle Dana, an expatriate
Parisian and self-described ``settler'' who organizes periodic
showcases for French musicians and disc jockeys at the Knitting
Factory in lower Manhattan's Tribeca section.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the French Touch generation that's moving in,'' she said.
``We're between 20 and 30. I think that without getting spiritual
it's a question of energy. There's a huge unemployment problem in
France, and the young generation has a hard time in the
entertainment industry. And after a while you want to stop waiting
and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Renaud, 32, moved from Paris to New York about 10 years
ago and took up the accordion and microphone to perform a mix of
retro romance songs ranging from Edith Piaf to the medieval.
Wearing hooded form-fitting gowns, she presents what she considers
a modern take on cabaret inspired by futuristic films like ``Blade
Runner'' and ``The Fifth Element.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Renaud makes a weekly circuit of small clubs with names like
the Torch Club, on the Lower East Side, or La Luncheonette, in
Chelsea. On one slow Monday night, her ethereal soprano filled the
Torch Club, a warm, uncluttered space with textured walls, soaring
ceilings and glowing sconces that is so discreet there is nothing
to identify it from the street beyond its metal doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess being away from my country I have rediscovered my
culture,'' Ms. Renaud said. ``I started the accordion about three
years ago. Arriving in New York, the natural thing was to sing
French songs, and I felt free to do it: people expected me to sing
those songs. The other advantage in being in New York is that there
were not many people doing this kind of music, and so it was easier
for me to work here. I find that there's a different energy in New
York in the sense that people tend to take more risks.''
</P>
<P>
   `It's Really Burning'
</P>
<P>
   In late November the Knitting Factory organized its second
annual French Touch Festival, a regular series supported with seed
money from the Cultural Services of the French Embassy in New York
that seeks to promote French artists in the United States. PS 1
also was a host to French disc jockeys in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   There is a private circuit of clubs that regularly feature
Parisian-style dance music, notably Twilo, a cavernous club in
Chelsea. On Friday night, Jan. 14, it will present the latest event
in a series called ``Respect Is Burning.'' The gatherings, which
take place bimonthly (the next is March 17), are an outgrowth of
the ``Respect'' parties that used to be held regularly in Paris at
the Rex Club, a techno night spot next to the opulent Grand Rex
Theater on the Right Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it `Respect Is Burning' because the music would be so
crazy that we would say `it's really burning tonight,''' said Neil
Aline, a 23-year-old Parisian expatriate who has settled in the
East Village and makes his living as a disc jockey and concert
promoter.
</P>
<P>
   Like other fans of Le French Touch music, Aline stretches for
adjectives to characterize the sound, which exports the creme of
disc jockeys, programmers and producers working in France. ``It's
house music with a really funky touch,'' said Aline. ``It's
electronic-sounding but soulful at the same time. The bottom line
is that it's house music, but house music that never sounded like
this before.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowds that come to these events at the Knitting Factory,
Twilo or Izzy Bar are a mix of Americans and French expatriates.
Performers address the audience in English, but participants
respond with cries of ``Allez! Allez!''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very curious about electronic music because they
don't have as much as we do in Europe,'' said Adele Jacques, who
arrived from Paris a few months ago to sing at clubs like the
Knitting Factory or Fez. ``The reaction has actually been pretty
good. I was very astonished because they don't understand what
we're saying, but they like the music.''
</P>

   Balzac, par E-Mail
</P>
<P>
   Many of the French cultural events in New York are carefully
nurtured by the French government through subsidies and aid from
the Cultural Services of the French Embassy, which amounted to
about $500,000 last year in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The French Embassy helped underwrite the Knitting Factory's Le
French Touch Festival in November. And it helped bring Leveque's
``Stigmata'' to PS 1, which is also the site of ``On Your Own
Time,'' an international show that includes the work of the painter
Roman Opalka. Since 1965 Opalka has been exploring the passage of
time on large canvases painted with numbers. In December the French
Ministry of Culture and Globecast France Telecom provided the
museum with live transmissions of Opalka, who apparently has
decided to keep counting to infinity.
</P>
<P>
   The French government also supports traditional offerings, like
a series of performances in February at the Church of Saint
Ignatius de Loyola on Park Avenue by Oliver Latry, the organist for
the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris. It is also trying in a
low-key way to promote French literature in New York by organizing
lectures and cocktail parties for visiting authors whose new works
have been translated and published in the United States, among them
Jean-Paul Kauffmann, author of ``Black Room at Longwood,'' a
bittersweet exploration of Napoleon's final years in exile as a
prisoner of the British on the island of St. Helena.
</P>
<P>
   For those who prefer their French literature in French, there
are stores to satisfy the urge. A traditional choice is the
Librairie de France at Rockefeller Center, where basic children's
titles can be $20 or more. But it's also possible to buy digital
books by e-mail in minutes from Paris, where a new Internet upstart
called Zero Heure is publishing classic titles, original works and
contemporary books from other French publishers. The Web site _
www.00h00.com _ gives shoppers an easy way to test the purchasing
system with invitations to order free books. The electronic books,
ranging from about a dollar to $30, are cheaper than conventional
books, which can also be ordered from Zero Heure by mail.
</P>
<P>
   Le News Flash
</P>
<P>
   The links to Paris do not end with the Internet. Radio France
Internationale is on every morning at 6:30 on 91.5 FM, and Le
Journal de France 2 _ the daily evening news from Paris _ is
broadcast at 7 by WNYE on Channel 25. (The English subtitles
occasionally don't match the stories, but it can add to the
entertainment when a news anchor announces a breaking story while
the subtitles have her warbling '60s song lyrics.) A satellite dish
and a $10 subscription fee to TV5 USA will bring you 24 hours of
programming from French-speaking countries.
</P>
<P>
   Cable television also offers an assortment of French movies.
CUNY-TV on Channel 75, the station operated by the City University
of New York, is broadcasting French films with English subtitles on
Friday nights at 10 and Sunday afternoons at 3. Among the
lesser-known offerings is ``La Voie Est Libre,'' Stephane Clavier's
1998 film about a railroad employee who is laid off from his job
after 20 years only to become the main suspect in a strange hostage
crisis on a suburban railway.
</P>
<P>
   A French movie is shown several times every Tuesday at the
French Institute/Alliance Francaise, which also plans to present a
festival of short films from Jan. 24-26 grouped around themes like
youth and the bizarre. There is ``John,'' a short tale about a
Tarzan who has taken up residence in France, for example, and
``Gisele Kerozene,'' a contemporary story of a group of
``proto-punk'' witches embarked on a wild search for a magic skull.
Vive la difference.
</P>
<P>
   The Bistro Look
</P>
<P>
   For newly arrived expatriates, a circuit of informal French
bistros offer a fleeting taste of Paris. Some of the French
settlers effusively praise little restaurants like Jules in the
East Village, which often has live music or accordion brunches, and
Casimir, a bar bistro on Avenue B named for a bunny in an old
French television series.
</P>
<P>
   Casimir had the appropriate understated bistro look: exposed
brick walls, wooden cafe chairs, Charles Aznavour posters, and
anise-flavored Ricard served at the bar. My husband and I were less
impressed by a gum-chewing waitress who blew bubbles while serving
us French fries stacked inelegantly in a tin pail.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   So we tried a restaurant recommended by Pierre Buhler, the
cultural counselor for the French Embassy on Fifth Avenue. His pick
was La Bonne Soupe on West 55th Street in midtown Manhattan, a busy
restaurant that seems to peak in energy around noon on Sunday and
settles down for more leisurely eating by 2:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Paul Picot, the owner, presides over the red-checked tables
from a spot at a small curving wooden bar, his half-glasses
dangling from his neck. He has not deserted the French custom of
mingling to chat with diners or occasionally offer a free digestif.
</P>
<P>
   La Bonne Soupe is the kind of place that attracts French Embassy
employees and the occasional Parisian celebrity. On the Sunday we
were there, the French television personality and actress Sophie
Favier attracted little attention when she took a table next to us
with her mother, 4-year-old daughter and a photographer who was
trailing her for Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
   But we found our true refuge _ sans poodle, helas _ when we
stumbled into Chez Bernard at West Broadway and Grand Street in
SoHo, a bistro with exposed brick walls, an old wine press
transformed into a lamp and wine bottles numbering in the
thousands.
</P>
<P>
   It passed the test when my husband and his visiting brother
ordered the charcuterie and settled into a kind of French reverie
that is difficult to spell: mmmm-mmmm-mmmm.
</P>

   NEW YORK _ When Ron Rifkin turns red, the first impulse of any
sane person is to duck. A red Ron Rifkin means that whatever
character this fine actor is playing is erupting into a shower of
venom, and it's a fearsome phenomenon. Remembered most vividly as
the irate publisher of Jon Robin Baitz's ``Substance of Fire,''
Rifkin is now exercising his spleen at the Eugene O'Neill Theater,
and he can still throw a tantrum to singe the scenery.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, though, the heat waves never get past the edge of the
stage this time around. Playing an obscure poet of infinite bile in
``Wrong Mountain,'' David Hirson's windy, satiric fable of the
contemporary theater, the lean-faced Rifkin looks just right, like
a David Levine caricature in The New York Review of Books, all wiry
lines, pinched nostrils and academic forehead.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately Levine's drawings have more flesh on them than
Hirson's characters do. Even in highest dudgeon, Rifkin can not
disguise that what he is portraying is a walking, screaming sheaf
of ideas, meant to be weighed against other sides of an open,
unsolvable debate. By the evening's end, after his character has
gone through some imposed, magical reversals, Rifkin seems more or
less to have given up. You can't blame him.
</P>
<P>
   Adventurous new plays of ideas are rare on Broadway. Actually,
make that new plays period, since ``Wrong Mountain'' is the only
one running at the moment. What's more, it's a play about the
theater, something for which Hirson clearly has a lively if
complicated passion, informed by hard experience (he is the author
of the 1991 cult flop ``La Bete'') and a healthy gift for seeing
all sides of an issue.
</P>
<P>
   So it would be especially satisfying to embrace ``Wrong
Mountain,'' which tells the story of how Rifkin's pedantic poet
disdainfully enters (and wins) a playwriting contest on a bet. Yet
under the distancing direction of Richard Jones, who collaborated
to more virtuosic effect with Hirson on ``La Bete,'' the work gives
the overall impression of a very thin organism with a big set of
lungs. It screams, it rants, it talks itself blue; but it finally
fails to engage those watching it, even when it is insulting them.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``La Bete'' _ a Molieresque comedy set not only in the 17th
century but also in rhyming couplets _ ``Wrong Mountain'' is built
around the destructive presence of a human juggernaut. Whereas that
figure in ``La Bete'' was a philistine in a rarefied theatrical
world, Rifkin's character, Henry Dennett, is a self-proclaimed
aesthete in a world of philistines.
</P>
<P>
   Cultural mediocrity is to him what Communism was to Joseph
McCarthy. He sees it lurking everywhere, even in the form of an
admiring young poet who ill-advisedly asks Henry for his autograph
in a bookshop. The greatest object of his wrath, however, is the
contemporary theater _ an arena, not incidentally, in which Guy
Halperin (Michael Winters), the fiance of Henry's ex-wife (Beth
Dixon), has become a fat success.
</P>
<P>
   You may find yourself pausing before the quaint idea of the
American theater today as an avenue to mainstream success. (Has it
made a household name out of anyone in recent years, except
possibly, thanks to Disney, Julie Taymor?)
</P>
<P>
   Still, the rancorous Henry isn't the most clear-sighted of
fellows. At a family Christmas gathering, he excoriates Guy's
profession for producing ``the kind of sanctimonious kitsch that's
embraced as high art by an audience of suburban morons dimwitted
enough to believe that by going to a play they're having some sort
of `cultural experience.'''
</P>
<P>
   Such provocations lead to Henry's bet that he can get a play
produced in six months' time, which in turn leads him to an exurban
theater festival, overseen by the florid, fatuous and ultimately
rather touching Maurice (Daniel Davis, in the evening's one
performance to win over the audience).
</P>
<P>
   There, Henry continues to advance his disdainful theories, most
articulately in the presence of an awkward but intelligent young
playwright (nicely played by Daniel Jenkins), who diffidently but
firmly bests the older man on his own terms. At the same time,
Henry drinks from a mystic fountain that will turn him into
everything he despises.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Hirson refuses to slant his debates. The problem
is that neither he nor Jones makes those arguments dramatically
compelling or even, for that matter, much fun. The
equal-opportunity satire ranges from portrayals of the competitive
intellectualism within Henry's family (Ilana Levine and Bruce
Norris play the son and daughter for whom sneering is a conditioned
reflex) to the touchy-feely antics of the provincial theater
troupe.
</P>
<P>
   The comedy is scattershot, often glancing off its targets. There
are a couple of laugh-out-loud moments during the theater festival
scenes, especially when the actors introduce themselves to Henry.
``Thank you for your anger,'' says one of them, while another
presents herself saying, ``I shall have the great, great honor to
read the role of the Seahag.''
</P>
<P>
   That Seahag line is priceless, a dead-on rendering of actorly
inflation. But it isn't heartening to know that it is, for me at
least, the evening's high point. Like the last new comedy to open
on Broadway, ``Epic Proportions'' (which has since closed), ``Wrong
Mountain'' has enough funny material to create a lively television
sketch, but not much more.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the jokes are bizarrely on the level of second-tier
sitcoms, like the business of having Maurice always getting Henry's
name wrong. Such facile bits are out of whack with the show's more
outrageous comic elements, including that symbolic 40-foot worm
that has taken up residence in Henry's intestine.
</P>
<P>
   For all its conscious audacity, there is a strange uncertainty
about the tone of ``Wrong Mountain'' that Jones hasn't managed to
translate into a consistent style. Giles Cadle's sets are
cartoonish without being especially witty, and the performers have
trouble negotiating the sharp turns from parody into
sentimentality.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the first act, Henry, still ranting about
theatergoers, declaims, ``They go to bask in the flattering image
of themselves as people who are open enough to have their values
challenged, which is just another way of saying that they go to the
theater to have their values confirmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Point taken. But for theater to pierce an audience's
complacency, it needs to have a vigor, sharpness and authority that
``Wrong Mountain'' never quite musters. You can't, after all,
pierce the skin with a blunt instrument.

`TABOO': THE RACE TO THE SWIFT. OR IS IT THE SWIFT TO THE RACE? 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(dal) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Black athletes are so dominant in track, basketball, boxing and
football, and so strongly represented at the top echelons of
baseball, that a serious effort to determine why seems inevitable.
This particular inquiry, by Jon Entine, a former television
producer and freelance journalist, also has a provocative edge to
it because Entine drives relentlessly to a politically incorrect
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The conventionally acceptable view of blacks in sports would
stress culture and environment. Blacks have risen to such
paramountcy in so many sports because they are denied access to
opportunities in other areas of life, this argument goes, or
because the sports heroes who have already made it are compelling
role models. Entine says, by contrast, that environment is only one
factor. His view is that men and women from Africa or of African
ancestry possess genetic attributes that make them superior in
certain sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decisive variable is in our genes,'' he writes. ``There is
extensive and persuasive research that elite black athletes have a
phenotypic advantage _ a distinctive skeletal system and
musculature, metabolic structures and other characteristics forged
over tens of thousands of years of evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Entine makes a careful and reasoned case for this point of view,
and he argues forcefully against whatever tendency there may be out
there in the world of racial politics to misinterpret it. This does
not mean that he sweeps away all contrary arguments once and for
all.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, reading ``Taboo: Why Black Athletes Dominate Sports and
Why We're Afraid to Talk About It,'' I was not convinced that
environmental and cultural explanations are inadequate to account
for the phenomenon under discussion. Other instances in which a
population dominates an area of activity _ Jews (and increasingly
Asians) on stringed instruments, Russians in chess, Cubans in
Olympic boxing _ are clearly not explained by evolutionary
divergence, and the utter domination by blacks of basketball and
track might not be either.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Entine thoroughly covers the ground. He begins with an
overview of the current sports situation to show the extent of
black supremacy, citing, for example, the remarkable fact that
``every world record at every commonly run track distance now
belongs to a runner of African descent.'' Even in more racially
mixed sports like baseball, Entine produces studies showing that
blacks are, on average, better than whites by an important
statistical margin.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way he includes accounts of major episodes in the
morally and politically rich American history of blacks in
professional sports, including the troubled career of Jack Johnson,
the first black heavyweight boxing champion; the triumphs of Jessie
Owen and Joe Lewis; and the explosion of black power at the 1968
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   But the heart of Entine's study is an examination of the debates
that rage in the fields of genetics and evolutionary biology. Here
he does not accept the idea that race is merely a subjective
quality, a social construct corresponding to no physical reality.
In several chapters he advances the theory that while all humans
have a common ancestor, there are several racial lineages within
that family, lineages that have some different and even measurable
characteristics, described in detail in this book.
</P>
<P>
   This is, as Entine suggests in his title, not a politically easy
subject, and he makes every effort to distinguish himself from the
long European history of crude race theorizing. He is fully aware
of the nasty double bind that blacks, especially in the United
States, have always been in when the subject was sports. During the
long years when sports were mostly segregated, the common
assumption was that blacks didn't have the reflexes or the
character to be as good as whites.
</P>
<P>
   Entine in this regard cites the immortally ill-advised words of
the sports columnist Jimmy Powers who, commenting in 1945 on the
news that Jackie Robinson had been hired to play for a Brooklyn
Dodgers farm team, wrote, ``The Negro players simply don't have the
brains or the skill.''
</P>
<P>
   Once black athletes had made cinders of that notion, a different
but also racist assumption took its place, namely that the natural
athleticism of blacks was a corollary to other supposed attributes:
a more primitive nature, greater brutishness, less intelligence.
The problem is that once you have isolated one genetic distinction
in a racial population, even an advantageous one, the field is open
to find other racial attributes, including disadvantageous ones.
For this reason many people both black and white have not only felt
uncomfortable with arguments about genetically based athletic
prowess, some have denounced as racist those who have expressed
opinions about that prowess.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although people accept the role of genetics in individual
differences _ not many of us would expect to survive a one-on-one
game of hoops with Allen Iverson _ any evidence that innate
differences exist between races or the sexes is considered
inflammatory and inadmissible by the prevailing intellectual
zeitgeist,'' Entine writes. He then repudiates the common equation
of ``natural athleticism'' with intellectual inferiority.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cannot be stated too strongly that the data that
conclusively links our ancestry to athletic skills have little or
anything to say about intelligence,'' he writes. ``Differences on
the track or basketball court do not necessarily mean differences
between the ears.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the argument can be summed up in a quotation that
Entine provides from Joe Morgan, the black Hall of Fame baseball
player, now a broadcaster: ``Blacks, for physiological reasons,
have better speed, quickness and ability. Baseball, football and
basketball put a premium on these skills.'' Entine, illustrating
this point, cites the experience of a Swedish researcher who
brought a half-dozen top Swedish runners to Kenya, where they were
soundly trounced by East African schoolboys at every distance. The
Swede concluded that there were 500 boys from that one small area
in Africa who could beat the best his country had to offer.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility remains, nonetheless, that culture has more
power than Entine realizes, that such things as habitat, childhood
experience, local custom and the unavailability of alternative
avenues to fame and fortune (Swedes, let's face it, have more
nonsports chances than Kenyans) can be decisive. Still, Entine's
conclusion that racially distinctive features are an essential
element of the picture is part of a sophisticated argument that,
whether entirely persuasive or not, cannot be dismissed.

&HT;     BIRD WATCHERS SAY QUAIL ON DECLINE IN GOLDEN GATE PARK 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC BRAZIL  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ California quail, the Golden State's official
bird, are on the verge of disappearing from Golden Gate Park, where
they were once so numerous they were regarded as a nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   The Golden Gate Audubon Society's annual Christmas bird count
found just 12 quail in the park, all in Strybing Arboretum's
botanical gardens.
</P>
<P>
   The quail population ``won't resuscitate unless we do something,
that's for sure,'' said Alan Hopkins, past president of the Audubon
Society chapter. ``As a viable population, it's on the verge of
disappearing. There are only three females left.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins launched a Save the Quail campaign last summer to
restore habitat where quail coveys can flourish, but the population
count declined from 40 in 1998 nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   Four decades ago, hundreds of quail made their homes in the
park, and Strybing Arboretum horticulture manager Don Mahoney
recalls that ``there was an active program to get rid of them,
because they were scratching up the gardens.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Mahoney said, cold weather and scrub jays,
which are fond of feeding on quail chicks, have reduced the
population.
</P>
<P>
   ``There used to be tons of quail in the park; now, you just
don't see them,'' said Arthur Feinstein, executive director of the
Golden Gate Audubon Society.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein blames feral cats for the perilous state of the quail
population, a charge hotly denied by animal-loving activists, who
feed the park's cats.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein has quit arguing the point. ``That issue is a dead end
in terms of resolution,'' he said. ``It's non-winnable.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein also blames poor management of flora in the park,
which has deprived quail of the brushy habitat needed to maintain a
healthy population.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, the quail population is in good shape, said
Department of Fish and Game biologist Sam Blankenship. The
population decline in Golden Gate Park may be hard to arrest
because ``it's difficult for an isolated area like that to
repopulate. Quail (populations) boom and bust, and there's no ebb
and flow from other population areas.''
</P>
<P>
   California hunters bagged 500,374 quail during the staggered
hunting seasons, which run from the last week in September until
Jan. 10. The bag limit is 10 quail per day.
</P>
<P>
   Two weekends ago, 40 Save the Quail volunteers from the Audubon
Society and two local high schools pitched in to plant atriplex
(quail bush) and ceanothus in the park's arboretum. They are
creating a quail-friendly thicket where the park's remnant coveys
live.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quail like some space around the thicket, so we'll have to do
summer maintenance where the thick European grasses are,'' Mahoney
said. Quail need a clear field of vision beyond their thickets,
because ``cats hang out in those tall grasses,'' he said.

AIMEE MANN HELPS `MAGNOLIA' BLOOM
</HEADLINE>

By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Critically acclaimed singer-songwriter Aimee Mann doesn't
consider herself a muckraker, and she certainly doesn't see herself
as any kind of whistle blower. Yet this perennial music-biz
insider, whose songs play a pivotal role in Paul Thomas Anderson's
widely praised film ``Magnolia,'' is a fearless soul.
</P>
<P>
   At the risk of burning bridges by exposing the inner-workings of
the world's largest record companies, Mann tells how label execs
have continually tried to change her music even to the point of
refusing to release her albums. Most recently, the Golden
Globe-nominated Mann shelled out a significant amount of cash to
buy back her latest album, ``Bachelor No. 2,'' from her previous
label, Interscope Records, rather than agree to their demands to
scrap parts of it so she could write and record more radio-friendly
material.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons it's so frustrating dealing with people at
record companies who are trying to push you in a direction you're
not comfortable with, is that they're trying to get you to do stuff
you're not good at,'' Mann said. ``Posing for pictures and videos
and schmoozing are the things I'm least competent at.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Magnolia'' soundtrack features nine songs from Mann,
including the opening theme, a cover of Harry Nilsson's ``One.''
The first single, ``Save Me,'' was nominated last month for a
Golden Globe for best original song. ``She is the great articulator
of the biggest things we think about,'' Anderson said. ``You can
look at the movie as the perfect memento to remember the songs that
Aimee has made. Aimee is a brilliant writer.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann, who rose to fame with '80s pop band 'Til Tuesday, appears
Saturday in an acoustic in-store show at Borders in Santa Monica.
In a perverse way, she enjoys the challenge of performing for free
at a busy bookstore. ``Part of me gets a kick playing for people
who aren't paying much attention,'' Mann said this week. ``I mean,
I don't think those kinds of things are my favorite gigs in the
world. It's a brightly lit situation where everyone's drinking
coffee and yawning. Lilith Fair was like that _ people wandering
around looking at booths. A lot of them don't know who you are. I'm
just the soundtrack to their good times.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann's third solo album and first independent release,
``Bachelor No. 2,'' released on her own Superego label, will be
available early next month just as she goes out on tour with her
husband of two years, fellow singer-songwriter Michael Penn. Mann
says Interscope's complaints about the new disc included her choice
of a writing partner (Elvis Costello) for a track titled ``Fall of
the World's Own Optimist.'' It marks her first collaboration with
Costello since ``The Other End of the Telescope,'' which Costello
also cut, after its initial appearance on a 'Til Tuesday album.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our record back, and I'm sure Interscope could've
given us a lot more trouble about getting it back, but they didn't,
and God bless 'em,'' Mann said. ``People who want to have giant
hits at any cost, that's the place for them. If they want to make
fabulous videos and have giant hits and have people asking them
what they're wearing at the Grammys, that's perfect for them. It's
the system they belong in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been a system for people like me in a long, long
time. I was crazy to think I could find some way to make it work
for me. As it happens, I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite her marriage, many of Mann's songs on ``Bachelor'' deal
with being single. ``Some of them I had already written or started
working on before we were married,'' she explained. ``But my
relationship with Michael is so unique that there are ways in which
I don't really feel like I'm in a relationship, because I've
defined `relationship' as being this sort of unwieldy, nightmarish
thing. Having a happy marriage enables you to actually get work
done, rather than being so despondent you just sit in a room for
days on end. And he's also a great help in bouncing things off of
and getting a good second opinion. It's nice have another
professional musician in the house.''
</P>
<P>
   After 'Til Tuesday disbanded, Mann released her 1993 solo debut,
``Whatever,'' (Imago) to enthusiastic reviews. Her 1996 follow-up,
the Jon Brion-produced ``I'm With Stupid'' (Geffen), was hailed in
Time as one of the ``catchiest pop albums of the year, brimming
with poised three-minute mini-masterpieces.''
</P>
<P>
   The latter album's Squeeze-augmented ``That's Just What You
Are'' appeared on the popular ``Melrose Place'' soundtrack album.
Mann also placed songs in ``Jerry Maguire'' (filmmaker Cameron
Crowe being among of her most ardent fans), ``Cruel Intentions''
and ``Sliding Doors.''
</P>
<P>
   But it will probably be because of Anderson's inspired use of
Mann's material in his ``Magnolia'' that the Los Angeles-based
singer-songwriter will become even better-known. Typically, Mann
downplays her part in the creation of ``Magnolia,'' a strong
contender in this movie awards season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul gave me a sense early on of how the songs would be
used,'' she said. ``But when you see the finished product, it felt
like I fooled everyone. But I don't know who I felt like I was
fooling. Maybe myself.'' &QL;

   Dot Allison/``Afterglow'' (Arista)
</P>
<P>
   Ex-chanteuse of the Scottish indie trio One Dove, Allison makes
her solo debut with this ambient and ultimately unsatisfying effort
that utilizes heavy-lidded dub rhythms and highly treated,
reverb-laden vocal effects. The over-produced album, which enjoys
strong word of mouth on the street, aims for the brooding, dark and
mysterious mood of Portishead, but rarely breathes the same chilly
night air. A diverse group including Death in Vegas' Richard
Fearless, ex-Stone Roses bassist Mani and even '60s lyricist Hal
David are on board, while Allison dabbles in so many half-baked
styles that the effect becomes blurred and boring.The best moments
here are the first two tracks _ ``Colour Me,'' a sensual slice of
trip-hop with a strong chorus that would sound terrific on KROQ,
and ``Tomorrow,'' an acoustic guitar-driven number that recalls
Beth Orton's electro-folk, but is plainly not as addictive. After a
few painful listenings to the rest, Allison's overly breathy
delivery _ which sounds like she's gasping for air through a
drinking straw _ begins to grate, and it quickly becomes clear that
time is too short to bask in this particular ``Afterglow.'' 2 stars

   If you were listening to the radio 30 years ago, chances are
you'd run into at least a couple of these cuts. The makers of this
film about mental illness capture the mood of the times well, using
nuggets from the Band, Aretha Franklin, the Mamas &AMP; the Papas, the
Chambers Brothers and Jefferson Airplane to suggest the turbulence
both inside and outside the hospital walls. The compilation opens
strong with Wilco's ``How to Fight Loneliness,'' an example of a
current band clearly influenced by what's gone before. But the bulk
of the 10 tracks here are decades-old originals, like Merrilee
Rush's lovely reading of ``Angel of the Morning.'' Before the disc
veers off into Mychael Danna's original score, the Petula Clark hit
``Downtown'' strikes an optimistic, yet oddly disorienting note. 2

   ``The Complete Savoy Recordings''/The Johnny Otis Rhythm &AMP; Blues
Caravan (Savoy Jazz)
</P>
<P>
   This three-disc, 77-song compilation of the fabulous r&AMP;b, blues
and jazz work by pioneer bandleader (and Watts club owner) Otis has
such collaborators as Little Esther, Big Jay McNeely, Jimmy Rushing
and the Robins. Among the nine previously unissued songs are a
couple of oddities, especially the ``Hunter Hancock Theme'' from a
long-lost L.A. radio show. The rest of the collection is wonderful,
ranging over a huge chunk of what used to be called ``race music,''
from burlesque-house fave ``Harlem Nocturne'' to big hits like
``Double Crossing Blues.'' As the excellent liner notes point out,
Otis is best-known for a rock 'n' roll song, ``Willie and the Hand
Jive,'' but he had 15 Top 10 hits in just two years on the then-new
r&AMP;b charts before that song (which isn't on this collection) came
along. Give a listen to some of the great early work of one of
modern pop's undersung pioneers. 3 1/2 stars

swing (``Dreaming Cowboy'') to oddly upbeat apocalyptic shuffle
(``Dark Sun''), with big hat tips to traditions of all kinds
(Johnny Cash's ``Cry Cry Cry''to the nortena ``Cancion Para Mi
Padre'') in between. Through it all, Timms' ethereal, yet precise
vocals give every song a warm, mescal-and-honey resonance. 4 stars

   As modern-day soundtracks go, this is both an honorable and an
interesting one, with music actually used in the film instead of
conjured up as a marketing add-on. It's wonderfully diverse and
atmospheric, with classic '50s jazz tracks from Charlie Parker,
Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie; more recent work of the same
period sensibility by the Guy Barker International Quintet;
luscious orchestral scoring from Gabriel Yared; and wonderful slow
ballads by Sinead O'Connor and John Martyn, whose ``You Don't Know
What Love Is'' is his second amazing cover release in four months
(see KCRW-FM's ``Morning Becomes Eclectic'' album). The one
moderately regrettable inclusion, done purely for marketing
purposes: actor Matt Damon's flat-toned ``My Funny Valentine.'' He
may be as gorgeous and cool as a would-be Chet Baker, but that
doesn't mean Damon can sing like that lost great one. Couldn't they
have lip-synched in the original? Or !ital!something!off!?
Otherwise, a stellar collection. 3 1/2 stars

   Keith Jarrett/``The Melody at Night, With You'' (ECM)
</P>
<P>
   It's somehow appropriate to begin the new year with a word about
one of the finest albums produced in 1999. This is a change-up from
Jarrett, a pianist known best for breakneck improvisational skills
and freewheeling phrasing. Here, in a gorgeous program of
standards, Jarrett redefines himself with romantic, elegant and
spare playing, creating a timeless work of beauty that owes as much
to classical tradition as it does to jazz. It's as if Jarrett,
recently recovered from a bout with chronic fatigue syndrome,
decided to pause and reflect and, in doing so, finds as much
meaning in silences as he ever did in his rapturous roars. 4 stars

<P>
   Savoy Jazz, courtesy of Atlantic Records, has one of the best
jazz reissue programs going right now, and these titles are but two
of several excellent albums finding their way into record stores.
The Harden/Coltrane sessions (3 stars), recorded over two dates in
1958, have been reissued in a number of different forms over the
years; here they find a definitive, two-disc compilation. Harden, a
talented trumpeter who more or less disappeared off the face of the
Earth after these sessions, wrote most of the material and finds
wonderful support from a blooming Coltrane, as well as pianist
Tommy Flanagan and trombonist Curtis Fuller.
</P>
<P>
   The Adderley Brothers dates (3 1/2 stars) likewise have been
available here and there over the years, having been originally
issued as an album from drummer Kenny Clarke. The two-disc set
marks the recording debut of famed alto great Cannonball Adderley
and brother Nat (who recently passed away), as well as trumpeter
Donald Byrd. The Adderleys arrived in New York, their talents
already fully formed, and these excellent, hard-blowing 1955
sessions show them swinging in high style with Byrd and Clarke,
pianist Horace Silver and bassist Paul Chambers. The music is every
bit as good as the stellar lineup.

   Dot Allison/``Afterglow'' (Arista)
</P>
<P>
   Ex-chanteuse of the Scottish indie trio One Dove, Allison makes
her solo debut with this ambient and ultimately unsatisfying effort
that utilizes heavy-lidded dub rhythms and highly treated,
reverb-laden vocal effects. The over-produced album, which enjoys
strong word of mouth on the street, aims for the brooding, dark and
mysterious mood of Portishead, but rarely breathes the same chilly
night air. A diverse group including Death in Vegas' Richard
Fearless, ex-Stone Roses bassist Mani and even '60s lyricist Hal
David are on board, while Allison dabbles in so many half-baked
styles that the effect becomes blurred and boring.The best moments
here are the first two tracks _ ``Colour Me,'' a sensual slice of
trip-hop with a strong chorus that would sound terrific on KROQ,
and ``Tomorrow,'' an acoustic guitar-driven number that recalls
Beth Orton's electro-folk, but is plainly not as addictive. After a
few painful listenings to the rest, Allison's overly breathy
delivery _ which sounds like she's gasping for air through a
drinking straw _ begins to grate, and it quickly becomes clear that
time is too short to bask in this particular ``Afterglow.'' 2 stars

AIMEE MANN HELPS `MAGNOLIA' BLOOM
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Critically acclaimed singer-songwriter Aimee Mann doesn't
consider herself a muckraker, and she certainly doesn't see herself
as any kind of whistle blower. Yet this perennial music-biz
insider, whose songs play a pivotal role in Paul Thomas Anderson's
widely praised film ``Magnolia,'' is a fearless soul.
</P>
<P>
   At the risk of burning bridges by exposing the inner-workings of
the world's largest record companies, Mann tells how label execs
have continually tried to change her music even to the point of
refusing to release her albums. Most recently, the Golden
Globe-nominated Mann shelled out a significant amount of cash to
buy back her latest album, ``Bachelor No. 2,'' from her previous
label, Interscope Records, rather than agree to their demands to
scrap parts of it so she could write and record more radio-friendly
material.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons it's so frustrating dealing with people at
record companies who are trying to push you in a direction you're
not comfortable with, is that they're trying to get you to do stuff
you're not good at,'' Mann said. ``Posing for pictures and videos
and schmoozing are the things I'm least competent at.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Magnolia'' soundtrack features nine songs from Mann,
including the opening theme, a cover of Harry Nilsson's ``One.''
The first single, ``Save Me,'' was nominated last month for a
Golden Globe for best original song. ``She is the great articulator
of the biggest things we think about,'' Anderson said. ``You can
look at the movie as the perfect memento to remember the songs that
Aimee has made. Aimee is a brilliant writer.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann, who rose to fame with '80s pop band 'Til Tuesday, appears
Saturday in an acoustic in-store show at Borders in Santa Monica.
In a perverse way, she enjoys the challenge of performing for free
at a busy bookstore. ``Part of me gets a kick playing for people
who aren't paying much attention,'' Mann said this week. ``I mean,
I don't think those kinds of things are my favorite gigs in the
world. It's a brightly lit situation where everyone's drinking
coffee and yawning. Lilith Fair was like that _ people wandering
around looking at booths. A lot of them don't know who you are. I'm
just the soundtrack to their good times.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann's third solo album and first independent release,
``Bachelor No. 2,'' released on her own Superego label, will be
available early next month just as she goes out on tour with her
husband of two years, fellow singer-songwriter Michael Penn. Mann
says Interscope's complaints about the new disc included her choice
of a writing partner (Elvis Costello) for a track titled ``Fall of
the World's Own Optimist.'' It marks her first collaboration with
Costello since ``The Other End of the Telescope,'' which Costello
also cut, after its initial appearance on a 'Til Tuesday album.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our record back, and I'm sure Interscope could've
given us a lot more trouble about getting it back, but they didn't,
and God bless 'em,'' Mann said. ``People who want to have giant
hits at any cost, that's the place for them. If they want to make
fabulous videos and have giant hits and have people asking them
what they're wearing at the Grammys, that's perfect for them. It's
the system they belong in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been a system for people like me in a long, long
time. I was crazy to think I could find some way to make it work
for me. As it happens, I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite her marriage, many of Mann's songs on ``Bachelor'' deal
with being single. ``Some of them I had already written or started
working on before we were married,'' she explained. ``But my
relationship with Michael is so unique that there are ways in which
I don't really feel like I'm in a relationship, because I've
defined `relationship' as being this sort of unwieldy, nightmarish
thing. Having a happy marriage enables you to actually get work
done, rather than being so despondent you just sit in a room for
days on end. And he's also a great help in bouncing things off of
and getting a good second opinion. It's nice have another
professional musician in the house.''
</P>
<P>
   After 'Til Tuesday disbanded, Mann released her 1993 solo debut,
``Whatever,'' (Imago) to enthusiastic reviews. Her 1996 follow-up,
the Jon Brion-produced ``I'm With Stupid'' (Geffen), was hailed in
Time as one of the ``catchiest pop albums of the year, brimming
with poised three-minute mini-masterpieces.''
</P>
<P>
   The latter album's Squeeze-augmented ``That's Just What You
Are'' appeared on the popular ``Melrose Place'' soundtrack album.
Mann also placed songs in ``Jerry Maguire'' (filmmaker Cameron
Crowe being among of her most ardent fans), ``Cruel Intentions''
and ``Sliding Doors.''
</P>
<P>
   But it will probably bee of Anderson's inspired use of
Mann's material in his ``Magnolia'' that the Los Angeles-based
singer-songwriter will become even better-known. Typically, Mann
downplays her part in the creation of ``Magnolia,'' a strong
contender in this movie awards season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul gave me a sense early on of how the songs would be
used,'' she said. ``But when you see the finished product, it felt
like I fooled everyone. But I don't know who I felt like I was
fooling. Maybe myself.'' &QL;

strong word of mouth on the street, aims for the brooding, dark and

   If you were listening to the radio 30 years ago, chances are
you'd run into at least a couple of these cuts. The makers of this
film about mental illness capture the mood of the times well, using
nuggets from the Band, Aretha Franklin, the Mamas &AMP; the Papas, the
Chambers Brothers and Jefferson Airplane to suggest the turbulence
both inside and outside the hospital walls. The compilation opens
strong with Wilco's ``How to Fight Loneliness,'' an example of a
current band clearly influenced by what's gone before. But the bulk
of the 10 tracks here are decades-old originals, like Merrilee
Rush's lovely reading of ``Angel of the Morning.'' Before the disc
veers off into Mychael Danna's original score, the Petula Clark hit
``Downtown'' strikes an optimistic, yet oddly disorienting note. 2

   ``The Complete Savoy Recordings''/The Johnny Otis Rhythm &AMP; Blues
Caravan (Savoy Jazz)
</P>
<P>
   This three-disc, 77-song compilation of the fabulous r&AMP;b, blues
and jazz work by pioneer bandleader (and Watts club owner) Otis has
such collaborators as Little Esther, Big Jay McNeely, Jimmy Rushing
and the Robins. Among the nine previously unissued songs are a
couple of oddities, especially the ``Hunter Hancock Theme'' from a
long-lost L.A. radio show. The rest of the collection is wonderful,
ranging over a huge chunk of what used to be called ``race music,''
from burlesque-house fave ``Harlem Nocturne'' to big hits like
``Double Crossing Blues.'' As the excellent liner notes point out,
Otis is best-known for a rock 'n' roll song, ``Willie and the Hand
Jive,'' but he had 15 Top 10 hits in just two years on the then-new
r&AMP;b charts before that song (which isn't on this collection) came
along. Give a listen to some of the great early work of one of
modern pop's undersung pioneers. 3 1/2 stars

<P>
   As modern-day soundtracks go, this is both an honorable and an
interesting one, with music actually used in the film instead of
conjured up as a marketing add-on. It's wonderfully diverse and
atmospheric, with classic '50s jazz tracks from Charlie Parker,
Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie; more recent work of the same
period sensibility by the Guy Barker International Quintet;
luscious orchestral scoring from Gabriel Yared; and wonderful slow
ballads by Sinead O'Connor and John Martyn, whose ``You Don't Know
What Love Is'' is his second amazing cover release in four months
(see KCRW-FM's ``Morning Becomes Eclectic'' album). The one
moderately regrettable inclusion, done purely for marketing
purposes: actor Matt Damon's flat-toned ``My Funny Valentine.'' He
may be as gorgeous and cool as a would-be Chet Baker, but that
doesn't mean Damon can sing like that lost great one. Couldn't they
have lip-synched in the original? Or !ital!something!off!?
Otherwise, a stellar collection. 3 1/2 stars

   Keith Jarrett/``The Melody at Night, With You'' (ECM)
</P>
<P>
   It's somehow appropriate to begin the new year with a word about
one of the finest albums produced in 1999. This is a change-up from
Jarrett, a pianist known best for breakneck improvisational skills
and freewheeling phrasing. Here, in a gorgeous program of
standards, Jarrett redefines himself with romantic, elegant and
spare playing, creating a timeless work of beauty that owes as much
to classical tradition as it does to jazz. It's as if Jarrett,
recently recovered from a bout with chronic fatigue syndrome,
decided to pause and reflect and, in doing so, finds as much
meaning in silences as he ever did in his rapturous roars. 4 stars

   The Adderley Brothers/``The Summer of '55'' (Savoy Jazz)
</P>
<P>
   Savoy Jazz, courtesy of Atlantic Records, has one of the best
jazz reissue programs going right now, and these titles are but two
of several excellent albums finding their way into record stores.
The Harden/Coltrane sessions (3 stars), recorded over two dates in
1958, have been reissued in a number of different forms over the
years; here they find a definitive, two-disc compilation. Harden, a
talented trumpeter who more or less disappeared off the face of the
Earth after these sessions, wrote most of the material and finds
wonderful support from a blooming Coltrane, as well as pianist
Tommy Flanagan and trombonist Curtis Fuller.
</P>
<P>
   The Adderley Brothers dates (3 1/2 stars) likewise have been
available here and there over the years, having been originally
issued as an album from drummer Kenny Clarke. The two-disc set
marks the recording debut of famed alto great Cannonball Adderley
and brother Nat (who recently passed away), as well as trumpeter
Donald Byrd. The Adderleys arrived in New York, their talents
already fully formed, and these excellent, hard-blowing 1955
sessions show them swinging in high style with Byrd and Clarke,
pianist Horace Silver and bassist Paul Chambers. The music is every
bit as good as the stellar lineup.

   Dot Allison/``Afterglow'' (Arista)
</P>
<P>
   Ex-chanteuse of the Scottish indie trio One Dove, Allison makes
her solo debut with this ambient and ultimately unsatisfying effort
that utilizes heavy-lidded dub rhythms and highly treated,
reverb-laden vocal effects. The over-produced album, which enjoys
strong word of mouth on the street, aims for the brooding, dark and
mysterious mood of Portishead, but rarely breathes the same chilly
night air. A diverse group including Death in Vegas' Richard
Fearless, ex-Stone Roses bassist Mani and even '60s lyricist Hal
David are on board, while Allison dabbles in so many half-baked
styles that the effect becomes blurred and boring.The best moments
here are the first two tracks _ ``Colour Me,'' a sensual slice of
trip-hop with a strong chorus that would sound terrific on KROQ,
and ``Tomorrow,'' an acoustic guitar-driven number that recalls
Beth Orton's electro-folk, but is plainly not as addictive. After a
few painful listenings to the rest, Allison's overly breathy
delivery _ which sounds like she's gasping for air through a
drinking straw _ begins to grate, and it quickly becomes clear that
time is too short to bask in this particular ``Afterglow.'' 2 stars

   If you were listening to the radio 30 years ago, chances are
you'd run into at least a couple of these cuts. The makers of this
film about mental illness capture the mood of the times well, using
nuggets from the Band, Aretha Franklin, the Mamas &AMP; the Papas, the
Chambers Brothers and Jefferson Airplane to suggest the turbulence
both inside and outside the hospital walls. The compilation opens
strong with Wilco's ``How to Fight Loneliness,'' an example of a
current band clearly influenced by what's gone before. But the bulk
of the 10 tracks here are decades-old originals, like Merrilee
Rush's lovely reading of ``Angel of the Morning.'' Before the disc
veers off into Mychael Danna's original score, the Petula Clark hit
``Downtown'' strikes an optimistic, yet oddly disorienting note. 2

   ``The Complete Savoy Recordings''/The Johnny Otis Rhythm &AMP; Blues
Caravan (Savoy Jazz)
</P>
<P>
   This three-disc, 77-song compilation of the fabulous r&AMP;b, blues
and jazz work by pioneer bandleader (and Watts club owner) Otis has
such collaborators as Little Esther, Big Jay McNeely, Jimmy Rushing
and the Robins. Among the nine previously unissued songs are a
couple of oddities, especially the ``Hunter Hancock Theme'' from a
long-lost L.A. radio show. The rest of the collection is wonderful,
ranging over a huge chunk of what used to be called ``race music,''
from burlesque-house fave ``Harlem Nocturne'' to big hits like
``Double Crossing Blues.'' As the excellent liner notes point out,
Otis is best-known for a rock 'n' roll song, ``Willie and the Hand
Jive,'' but he had 15 Top 10 hits in just two years on the then-new
r&AMP;b charts before that song (which isn't on this collection) came
along. Give a listen to some of the great early work of one of
modern pop's undersung pioneers. 3 1/2 stars

   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA (Argun) _ The Russian military insists it has
taken back this Chechen town. But on Thursday Russian soldiers
nervously scanned the rooftops and windows of Argun's battered
buildings as they sought to keep order. ``There are snipers
around,'' a Russian officer called out. ``Take care.'' Set in the
Chechen lowlands, Argun was taken by the Russian military in early
December. Today, however, it has become a salient example of how
hard it may be for Russia to take Chechnya and keep it. All across
Chechnya, Russian troops tried to tighten their grip over the swath
of territory ``liberated'' by Russian forces. By Michael R. Gordon.

   HARRODS-PHILIP (London) _ Buckingham Palace announced Thursday
that it was withdrawing the royal warrant awarded by Prince Philip,
the Duke of Edinburgh, to Harrods, the London department store that
is owned by Mohamed al-Fayed. A palace spokesman said the decision
was based on a falloff in business from the Duke, who originally
granted the honor in 1956. He made no reference to the fact that
six weeks ago Fayed called the prince a Nazi sympathizer and
accused him of masterminding a plot with the British security
services that resulted in the 1997 Paris car crash that killed
Diana, Princess of Wales, and her companion, his son, Emad Mohamed
al-Fayed, known as Dodi. By Warren Hoge.

   MICH-BOY-SENTENCED (Pontiac, Mich.) _ In an unexpected verdict,
a state judge ruled here Thursday that the youngest American ever

sentence at a maximum-security juvenile detention center and then
be released. The judge, rejecting prosecutors' requests that the
boy be sentenced to additional time in an adult prison after
serving time in juvenile detention, rebuked a system that he said
had gone too far in punishing juveniles. His sentencing also bucked
a trend in which, increasingly, juveniles charged with violent
crimes have been sentenced as adults. By Keith Bradsher.

   EPA-KOCH-WATER (Washington) _ Koch Industries, an oil pipeline

Thursday in the biggest civil fine ever paid for a company for
environmental violations. The EPA said the company, based in
Wichita, Kan., had agreed to pay a $30 million penalty for more
than 300 separate spills of crude oil, gasoline and other oil
products between 1990 and 1997. By Matthew L. Wald.

main event in New Hampshire. That may be changing. With only 10
days left until Jan. 24, when tens of thousands of Iowans will
assemble in living rooms, clubs and school halls to declare their
preferences, two well-funded, well-organized underdogs, Bill
Bradley and Steve Forbes, have accelerated their efforts. If not to
defeat their respective rivals, Al Gore and George W. Bush, they
hope to come very close _ close enough to give them a lift as they
move to New Hampshire, whose critical primary takes place only

marks the recording debut of famed alto great Cannonball Adderley
and brother Nat (who recently passed away), as well as trumpeter
Donald Byrd. The Adderleys arrived in New York, their talents
already fully formed, and these excellent, hard-blowing 1955
sessions show them swinging in high style with Byrd and Clarke,
pianist Horace Silver and bassist Paul Chambers. The music is every
bit as good as the stellar lineup.

   Dot Allison/``Afterglow'' (Arista)
</P>
<P>
   Ex-chanteuse of the Scottish indie trio One Dove, Allison makes
her solo debut with this ambient and ultimately unsatisfying effort
that utilizes heavy-lidded dub rhythms and highly treated,
reverb-laden vocal effects. The over-produced album, which enjoys
strong word of mouth on the street, aims for the brooding, dark and
mysterious mood of Portishead, but rarely breathes the same chilly
night air. A diverse group including Death in Vegas' Richard
Fearless, ex-Stone Roses bassist Mani and even '60s lyricist Hal
David are on board, while Allison dabbles in so many half-baked
styles that the effect becomes blurred and boring.The best moments
here are the first two tracks _ ``Colour Me,'' a sensual slice of
trip-hop with a strong chorus that would sound terrific on KROQ,
and ``Tomorrow,'' an acoustic guitar-driven number that recalls
Beth Orton's electro-folk, but is plainly not as addictive. After a
few painful listenings to the rest, Allison's overly breathy
delivery _ which sounds like she's gasping for air through a
drinking straw _ begins to grate, and it quickly becomes clear that
time is too short to bask in this particular ``Afterglow.'' 2 stars

   Soundtrack/``Girl, Interrupted'' (TVT)
</P>
<P>
   If you were listening to the radio 30 years ago, chances are
you'd run into at least a couple of these cuts. The makers of this
film about mental illness capture the mood of the times well, using
nuggets from the Band, Aretha Franklin, the Mamas &AMP; the Papas, the
Chambers Brothers and Jefferson Airplane to suggest the turbulence
both inside and outside the hospital walls. The compilation opens
strong with Wilco's ``How to Fight Loneliness,'' an example of a
current band clearly influenced by what's gone before. But the bulk
of the 10 tracks here are decades-old originals, like Merrilee
Rush's lovely reading of ``Angel of the Morning.'' Before the disc
veers off into Mychael Danna's original score, the Petula Clark hit
``Downtown'' strikes an optimistic, yet oddly disorienting note. 2

   ``The Complete Savoy Recordings''/The Johnny Otis Rhythm &AMP; Blues
Caravan (Savoy Jazz)
</P>
<P>
   This three-disc, 77-song compilation of the fabulous r&AMP;b, blues
and jazz work by pioneer bandleader (and Watts club owner) Otis has
such collaborators as Little Esther, Big Jay McNeely, Jimmy Rushing
and the Robins. Among the nine previously unissued songs are a
couple of oddities, especially the ``Hunter Hancock Theme'' from a
long-lost L.A. radio show. The rest of the collection is wonderful,
ranging over a huge chunk of what used to be called ``race music,''
from burlesque-house fave ``Harlem Nocturne'' to big hits like
``Double Crossing Blues.'' As the excellent liner notes point out,
Otis is best-known for a rock 'n' roll song, ``Willie and the Hand
Jive,'' but he had 15 Top 10 hits in just two years on the then-new
r&AMP;b charts before that song (which isn't on this collection) came
along. Give a listen to some of the great early work of one of
modern pop's undersung pioneers. 3 1/2 stars

   Sally Timms/``Cowboy Sally's Twilight Laments ... For Lost

</P>
<P>
   The singer from the English art punk band the Mekons has
delivered a sweet and haunting little country-western collection,
with help from cow dudes as diverse as Chicago-based Robbie Fulks
and Wilco's Jeff Tweedy. The songs range from easygoing melancholy
swing (``Dreaming Cowboy'') to oddly upbeat apocalyptic shuffle
(``Dark Sun''), with big hat tips to traditions of all kinds
(Johnny Cash's ``Cry Cry Cry''to the nortena ``Cancion Para Mi
Padre'') in between. Through it all, Timms' ethereal, yet precise
vocals give every song a warm, mescal-and-honey resonance. 4 stars

   Soundtrack/``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' (Sony Classical)
</P>
<P>
   As modern-day soundtracks go, this is both an honorable and an
interesting one, with music actually used in the film instead of
conjured up as a marketing add-on. It's wonderfully diverse and
atmospheric, with classic '50s jazz tracks from Charlie Parker,
Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie; more recent work of the same
period sensibility by the Guy Barker International Quintet;
luscious orchestral scoring from Gabriel Yared; and wonderful slow
ballads by Sinead O'Connor and John Martyn, whose ``You Don't Know
What Love Is'' is his second amazing cover release in four months
(see KCRW-FM's ``Morning Becomes Eclectic'' album). The one
moderately regrettable inclusion, done purely for marketing
purposes: actor Matt Damon's flat-toned ``My Funny Valentine.'' He
may be as gorgeous and cool as a would-be Chet Baker, but that
doesn't mean Damon can sing like that lost great one. Couldn't they
have lip-synched in the original? Or !ital!something!off!?
Otherwise, a stellar collection. 3 1/2 stars

   Woody Allen's latest, a much-lauded paean to a boorish boho of
Django Reinhardt-ian talent, results in an equally fine collection
of Depression-era jazz sounds (``Sweet Georgia Brown,'' ``All of

Howard Alden (and rhythm guitar by Bucky Pizzarelli). Tracks by
Sidney Bechet and Noble Sissle's Swingsters and Bunny Berigan's

   Keith Jarrett/``The Melody at Night, With You'' (ECM)
</P>
<P>
   It's somehow appropriate to begin the new year with a word about
one of the finest albums produced in 1999. This is a change-up from
Jarrett, a pianist known best for breakneck improvisational skills
and freewheeling phrasing. Here, in a gorgeous program of
standards, Jarrett redefines himself with romantic, elegant and
spare playing, creating a timeless work of beauty that owes as much
to classical tradition as it does to jazz. It's as if Jarrett,
recently recovered from a bout with chronic fatigue syndrome,
decided to pause and reflect and, in doing so, finds as much
meaning in silences as he ever did in his rapturous roars. 4 stars

<P>
   Savoy Jazz, courtesy of Atlantic Records, has one of the best
jazz reissue programs going right now, and these titles are but two
of several excellent albums finding their way into record stores.
The Harden/Coltrane sessions (3 stars), recorded over two dates in
1958, have been reissued in a number of different forms over the
years; here they find a definitive, two-disc compilation. Harden, a
talented trumpeter who more or less disappeared off the face of the
Earth after these sessions, wrote most of the material and finds
wonderful support from a blooming Coltrane, as well as pianist
Tommy Flanagan and trombonist Curtis Fuller.
</P>
<P>
   The Adderley Brothers dates (3 1/2 stars) likewise have been
available here and there over the years, having been originally
issued as an album from drummer Kenny Clarke. The two-disc set
marks the recording debut of famed alto great Cannonball Adderley

 &HT;    HISTORIAN ACCUSED OF FABRICATING HITLER ORDER
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON Jr.
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Historical writer David Irving was accused in court
Thursday of fabricating an order from Adolf Hitler calling for a
halt to mass murders of Jews in 1941 _ a key element in his
long-held argument that the Nazi leader had initially opposed the
genocide.
</P>
<P>
   In his controversial 1977 book ``Hitler's War,'' Irving wrote
that he had discovered ``incontrovertible evidence'' that Hitler
had ordered that there would be ``no liquidation'' of Jews.
</P>
<P>
   However, Irving acknowledged Thursday that he had based this
assertion on a misreading of a 1941 handwritten note from Gestapo
Chief Heinrich Himmler, not Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of demanding the end of the killing of all Jews, the
note actually suggested that Himmler spared just one trainload of
1,000 Jews transported from Berlin to Latvia.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence connecting Hitler even to the Himmler order is
merely circumstantial. Irving said he deduced this from the fact
that Himmler issued this order from a telephone in Hitler's bunker
after meeting with the Nazi leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``To conclude that it was Hitler's order was reasonable rather
than perverse,'' Irving said.
</P>
<P>
   He maintains that there is no clear evidence that Hitler was
aware of the mass killings before 1943. He rejected statements _
produced in court from soldiers, Hitler intimates and Nazi
officials _ that tend to suggest the German leader was at the heart
of the drive to exterminate the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Irving dismissed these accounts as either secondhand or flawed
in some other way.
</P>
<P>
   Irving is suing Emory University professor Deborah Lipstadt and
her publisher Penguin Books for libel over her 1994 book, ``Denying
the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory.'' The book
depicts the self-made historian as a ``Holocaust denier'' who
twists history to support his belief that the scope of the mass
murder has been greatly exaggerated. He believes Jews have sought
to use the Holocaust story in a campaign to get increased
reparations from the German people.
</P>
<P>
   The book also says he is motivated by his desire to exonerate
Hitler, a charge Irving denies. Irving, in his second day of being
cross-examined, said that this was a reasonable interpretation of
the evidence at the time and denied that he had intentionally
distorted the truth.
</P>
<P>
   However, lead defense attorney Richard Rampton accused Irving of
misleading the readers of his book by intentionally distorting the
contents of the documents and suggesting he had hard evidence that
Hitler had halted the killing of Jews. ``You invented a Hitler
order,'' Rampton icily told Irving, who stood in the witness box.
``You deliberately inflated it in a way to suggest that it meant
all of the Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   And even after Irving discovered

 &HT;    BLACK HOLES MAY LURK IN SPACE NEAR EARTH
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A newly discovered black hole floats alone and
invisible in a dark region of the Milky Way a few thousand light
years from the Earth, astronomers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Others probably await discovery much closer to this planet, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   The newly found black hole, probably a relic of an exploding
star, is only about 12 miles in diameter and is several thousand
light years from the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is not chewing up nearby stars or interstellar dust,
it is truly unseeable, David Bennett of the University of Notre
Dame said at the annual meeting here of the American Astronomical
Society. Like all black holes, it is so dense that nothing, not
even light, X-rays or other radiation, can escape its gravity.
</P>
<P>
   Previously discovered black holes, while not visible themselves,
can be easily identified by the glow of radiation from dust and
stars that heat up as they fall into the holes' gravitational
grasp.
</P>
<P>
   Some have companion stars, and others, known as ``supermassive''
black holes because they contain matter equivalent to hundreds of
millions or even a few billion suns, chew up stars and dust at the
centers of galaxies.
</P>
<P>
   But the isolated _ or ``naked'' black hole _ drifts through an
area of the galaxy where little or no matter is available to be
sucked in, Bennett said. Therefore, it is invisible.
</P>
<P>
   He and other astronomers said they located the Milky Way black
hole by observing the way its gravity distorted light from a star
passing behind it from the Earth, a technique known as
microlensing.
</P>
<P>
   ``These results suggest that black holes are common and that
many massive but normal stars end their lives as black holes,''
Bennett said. He said similar objects may lurk in dark regions
closer to the Earth, within about 100 light years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The number of identified ``supermassive'' black holes in the
central bulges of elliptical galaxies like the Milky Way rose to 20
Thursday when astronomers reported finding three new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Richstone, leader of a team that has been conducting a
systematic search for central holes in the galaxies, said the three
new holes appear to have masses ranging from 50 million to 100
million suns.
</P>
<P>
   He said the mass was calculated by measuring the speed with
which nearby stars orbit the black holes and determining the
gravity necessary to hold the stars in orbit.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the more than 1,600 astronomers attending the
conference have been studying black holes, the first discoveries to
be reported from the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's new Chandra X-ray Observatory included two new
kinds of objects billions of light years from the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The Chandra, which is 50 to 100 times more sensitive than any
previous X-ray telescope, discovered galaxies that ``shine''
brightly in X-rays but do not emit visible light, said NASA
astronomer Richard Mushotzky.
</P>
<P>
   These objects are being called ``veiled galactic nuclei,'' and
there may be tens of millions of them in the universe. The X-rays
they emit appear to come from black holes at their centers.
</P>
<P>
   Another class of hitherto undetected objects were described as
``ultra-faint galaxies'' because they also release little or no
optical light, either because it is absorbed by dust surrounding
them or because they are so far away, Mushotzky said.

 &HT;    ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS SUE TO ENFORCE MANATEE PROTECTIONS
 &HT;    530&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the manatee on the verge of extinction, a
coalition of environmental groups filed suits Thursday here and in
Florida demanding that laws be enforced to protect the endangered
species.
</P>
<P>
   The suits accused the Florida and federal governments of failing
to restrict and regulate the burgeoning pleasure boat traffic in
waters where manatees live, feed and breed.
</P>
<P>
   There are an estimated 2,400 manatees, sometimes known as ``sea
cows,'' frequenting the coastal waters of the Gulf of Mexico and
the southeastern seaboard, although there have been reports of
manatees as far north as Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Last year 268 manatees were known to have died, of which 105
were killed as a result of human activity, said Patrick Rose,
director of government relations for the Save the Manatee Club.
That included 82 deaths caused by watercraft, the highest number
ever recorded in one year
</P>
<P>
   The suits seek to force federal and state agencies to put more
law enforcement officers on manatee waterways, establish more
manatee sanctuaries and no-boating areas, and suspend coastal
development in manatee areas until local governments adopt
comprehensive manatee protections.
</P>
<P>
   The Save the Manatee Club, the lead group of 18 organizations
and three individuals bringing the suits, was founded in 1981 by
singer Jimmy Buffett.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the 728 manatees killed by human activity in the 11
years since the Florida Cabinet unanimously adopted a tough manatee
protection program, Rose said, ``most of these deaths could have
been prevented if the agencies had had the will to fully implement
and adequately enforce the necessary protection measures. ``
</P>
<P>
   Manatees, which swim just below the surface of the water, are
difficult to spot by boaters, particularly at high speeds. The
impact from propeller blades leave most manatees with painful
gashes and kills many.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad truth is that manatees and people like the same places
in Florida, and this mutual preference has led to ever-increasing
competition for space,'' said Naomi A. Rose, a marine mammal
scientist for the Humane Society of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who live and visit Florida have to make a decision.
Do they want ever-increasing numbers of boat slips and boats on the
water, at the expense of manatees and Florida's natural heritage?
Or do they want to protect the coastal habitats in Florida that
attract both manatees and people?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Cabbage, spokesman for the Florida Fish and Wildlife
Conservation Commission, said his agency was disappointed that
suits had been filed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it would have been more productive to launch a
cooperative effort to protect and preserve manatees. We feel the
lawsuit will divert resources from conservation of manatees to ...
litigation,'' Cabbage said.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the commission enacted new speed zones last month in
Lee County, which has the state's second highest manatee
population, Cabbage said the agency is committed to protecting the
species.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the federal Fish and Wildlife Service said her
agency had not seen the lawsuit and had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Eric Glitzenstein, lead attorney for the environmental groups,
said agencies responsible for approving permits for boat docks,
marinas and other coast developments have violated the intent of
the federal Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   The agencies have evaluated each permit application individually
to determine whether that one project could lead to the extinction
of the manatee species, Glitzenstein said. The agencies should be
considering the cumulative affect of approving each project, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This administration, whatever its record may be on other
environmental issues, has had a tepid and timid approach to the
Endangered Species Act,'' he said. ``The manatee is literally dying
the death of a thousand cuts.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two years ago, Joe, the man I lived with, suggested
that we outfit our apartment with a light especially created to
combat the winter blues. Seasonal affective disorder is its quaint
moniker. In fact, the condition is nothing more than a hunger for
daylight during the darkest days of winter.
</P>
<P>
   I vetoed the proposal. Call me a troglodyte. But what I wanted
was not to sit under 10,000 lux of white light to trick my brain
into believing it was spring. I wanted us to soak up the real
stuff, the unadorned light of the New York Harbor at sunset, say,
or the slow illumination of the city on a Sunday morning. We rarely
could make it. The light always faded too fast. There was always
too much work.
</P>
<P>
   Joe isn't here anymore. He went hiking up a mountain one day
last summer. It is believed that he slipped and fell in the woods.
Bloodhounds and rescue teams were sent for him. But the forest is
so dark and dense, his body has yet to be found.
</P>
<P>
   This winter, with unusual deliberation, I have taken to soaking
up the light alone, or mostly alone. I plot my days to squeeze in a
morning ride on the D subway train heading west across the
Manhattan Bridge. Early most Fridays, I walk through Prospect Park
in Brooklyn with a friend, sometimes after the rain has left a
carpet of leaves shiny black and treacherous. I troll for outings
that promise birds and sunsets on Jamaica Bay in Queens. I bundle
up for lunchtime sprints around Bryant Park in midtown Manhattan to
watch how the windows of the New York Public Library spit out the
sun's reflection.
</P>
<P>
   Unwittingly, I have turned into a student of light. The August
light that envelopes the beaten-down old streets of Red Hook, I
have learned, is more melancholy than the morning light during
lilac season in the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. The sun sparkling on
the crown of the Chrysler building is whimsical, like a woman
dressed for a party at high noon. The Chinese Scholars Garden on
Staten Island is perfect in late mornings in the fall; too bad it's
closed from January until spring, for the rock sculpture and
latticed windows would make a perfect canvas for the quick movement
of the sun in winter. The fluorescent light of the first snowfall
is, of course, best seen in a park _ in my mind, over the lake on
the southern edge of Prospect Park.
</P>
<P>
   Light regulates some of our most elemental functions. It enters
the retina and courses straight to the body clock, the ticking of
which controls everything from body temperature to cardiovascular
rates to the secretion of hormones. It isn't clear exactly why, but
disruption to those circadian rhythms _ pretending that it's July,
when in fact the nights last 14{ hours _ appears to provoke the
winter doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   Exposure to intense light produces rapid changes to the body
clock, which is why scientists and entrepreneurs have developed
ingenious light contraptions for winter woes. You can bask under a
light box for a half-hour first thing each morning. Someone has
invented a cap with bulbs under the visor. There's even a dawn
simulator that sends low intensity light through closed eyelids;
you don't have to be awake to enjoy its benefits. Of course, the
more luxurious option is to make like a bear and hibernate.
</P>
<P>
   I keep a mental log of light spots. I ask friends for their
favorites. One suggests a corner on the west end of Tompkins Square
Park in the East Village, another a square in Chinatown where old
people go for tai chi at dawn. Someone else proposes lunch on a
bench in Battery Park. Another swears by a shore front park on the
Hudson, way up where Manhattan kisses the Bronx. The ferry to
Staten Island is a recurring favorite. The writer Joseph Mitchell
talks of the ``smoky river-bank dawn'' by the Fulton Fish Market in
Lower Manhattan as having the power to elate him.
</P>
<P>
   The excursions that follow were culled from those remembrances.
Consider it a guide in the hunt for light in the city.
</P>
<P>
   It should be said plainly that there is no substitute for the
light-seeking strategies of birds and butterflies: to spend the
winter in the warmer latitudes. Nothing here can approximate the
warmth of the sun on a December afternoon, hiking up a hill
overlooking Los Angeles. For those of us who must survive yet
another winter in New York, certain deliberate excursions must be
undertaken: getting up early, slipping out of the harsh glare of
office lights, even if only for a few minutes every day, devoting a
day off to seeking out the light.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, there's a simple reward: the chance to witness how
the 5 o'clock hour turns from black to purple and rejoice when it
becomes golden by May. The next two months can be brutal, but the
winter solstice has passed, and the days grow longer from now on.
</P>
<P>
   The D Train
</P>
<P>
   Mammals often sleep longer in winter. Still, on many winter
mornings many of us feel only half-awake and lethargic, as big and
slow as a bear. For these mornings, there's the D train from
Brooklyn to Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Just as it leaves the last stop in Brooklyn, Dekalb Avenue, the
D train climbs onto the elevated tracks on the Manhattan Bridge and
daylight washes in. I prefer facing north. Sunny mornings offer the
best panoramas. A shaft of light falls on one side of a tall
building in the industrial forest known as Down Under the Manhattan
Bridge Overpass, or Dumbo. Then gray-green water and a platinum eel
slide across the Williamsburg Bridge, probably the J, M or Z train
heading to Bushwick. As the D train approaches the Manhattan
anchorage, you spot an orange shopping cart next to a white Chinese
laundry van. From the train window you see a blur of fabric and
fast hands in the windows of a garment factory, then a rooftop
puckishly covered in graffiti. The train descends into the dark
after that. By the time it makes its next stop, at Grand Street, I
am a little more alert and back to reading the newspaper.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Downtown Light
</P>
<P>
   A reminder from a friend who is a keen observer of such things:
in a city, the light on a narrow street is different from the light
on a wide boulevard; the light on one block can be completely
different from the light on the next, depending on the hue of the
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Early on a Sunday morning, the brightly painted fire escapes on
the back of the Puck Building turn the tight alley of Mulberry
Street into a daring canvas of blue on terra cotta. To the east,
the narrow paths of the East Village are shaded by rows of upscale
tenements. At 10 a.m. the postage stamp of a park on the corner of
East Eighth Street and Avenue C is half lighted. Along one side, a
row of willow trees is the color of corn, not the wispy green of a
weeping willow in summer. Their yellow branches spill over the
sidewalk, turning the crisp early morning sunshine golden.
</P>
<P>
   Farther east still, at the East River Park, the light is
entirely different _ unobstructed, with the river as its mirror.
Standing here, near the Sixth Street footbridge over FDR Drive,
one's sense of scale can get completely tweaked. The Williamsburg
Bridge looms just to the south: you can see its every industrial
muscle and bone. The trees, when they are winter bare, are a row of
gnarled limbs, like dancers frozen in difficult poses.
</P>
<P>
   Jamaica Bay
</P>
<P>
   Joe was a birder. When he disappeared, he was probably looking
for birds. He took his binoculars with him. I spent five years as
his reluctant birding partner. My job was to flip through bird
books, help identify whatever winged creature he thought he saw and
keep a record of it. Yellow warbler _ Cape May, N.J., 1996; scarlet
ibis _ Trinidad, 1997, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   So when a group of urban environmentalists announced a boat ride
at the end of the fall migration season through Jamaica Bay, that
marshy terrain oddly sandwiched between the towering housing
projects of the Rockaways and the runways of Kennedy Airport, it
caught my attention.
</P>
<P>
   Boat rides here are hard to come by, especially in winter, but
the shores of Jamaica Bay, whether from the trails near the
Wildlife Refuge Center or the sliver of the Rockaway Peninsula
called Bayswater Park, are perfect for midday walks. A colleague
once observed that the view of the Manhattan skyline from Queens is
like the inverse of the famous Manhattan-centric Saul Steinberg
cartoon. Nowhere is this more true than from the shores of Jamaica
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Jamaica Bay, with its cluster of tiny islands, is a rich
ecosystem. Some of the islands are covered with tall, marsh grasses
whose nutritious detritus is sustenance for the fish below; if you
squint into the sun, they look like wheat fields in water. On the
banks of Bayswater Park grow pines that resemble the gnarled
Monterey pine of the California coast. Hundreds of thousands of
birds, some 300 species, use these islands on their way south and
back again.
</P>
<P>
   A few birds stick around for the winter. The peregrine falcon,
when it chooses to stay, builds a nest on top of the southern tower
of the Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge, the westernmost bridge to the
Rockaways. We didn't see one on the afternoon of the boat ride. But
a flock of laughing gulls, shiny white in the buttery late
afternoon light, cruised by. A nearly extinct species of goose,
distinguished by its bright white rump, had arrived from the Arctic
tundra. A family of cormorants, their black bodies shiny and wet,
sat on a patch of sandy beach, flailing their wings for maximum
exposure to the sun. Just behind, a jumbo jet cruised down a
runway, part of another kind of migration.
</P>
<P>
   Red Hook
</P>
<P>
   Red Hook has a paucity of many modern conveniences _ banks,
restaurants, a subway stop closer than a mile away. Tall housing
projects dominate the skyline, and the Brooklyn neighborhood has
suffered from years of drugs, joblessness and official neglect.
What Red Hook has in abundant supply is light, some of the most
glorious light anywhere in the city. Painters and photographers
have long sung its praises.
</P>
<P>
   Afternoon light is Red Hook's treasure, and its best vista is
the broken-down far end of the Beard Street Pier. There's something
strangely anachronistic about this place, which is probably why
sunset in Red Hook is among the most melancholy.
</P>
<P>
   If you stare west, you can watch the sun go down over the barges
that still troll New York Harbor. Turning to the north, you see the
modern skyscrapers of lower Manhattan. Behind you in this corner of
Red Hook are red-brick warehouses from centuries past glowing as if
on fire at 4 o'clock. Some date to the Civil War era, when they
were apparently used by the Union army to store munitions. There's
an old Brooklyn trolley car parked off to the side, scrubbed clean
by the purveyors of Brooklyn nostalgia. Its destination: Ebbets
Field.
</P>
<P>
   Spuyten Duyvil
</P>
<P>
   A friend, a child of the Bronx, suggested Spuyten Duyvil Shore
Front Park, an unadorned strip of green tucked under the Henry
Hudson Bridge in the northwest Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   In Dutch, the phrase means roughly, ``spouting devil,''
according to Webster's New World Dictionary. The Encyclopedia of
New York suggests that it may be a corruption of a Dutch phrase
meaning ``in spite of the devil.'' Spuyten Duyvil refers both to a
narrow tidal waterway connecting the Harlem and Hudson Rivers and
to the adjacent neighborhood of steep, undulating streets.
</P>
<P>
   On a gloomy Sunday afternoon, the light in Spuyten Duyvil seems
eerie, otherworldly. Just overhead is the blue underbelly of the
Henry Hudson Bridge, linking upper Manhattan and the Riverdale
section of the Bronx. Like a child's toy, another silver-colored
railroad bridge lies just to the west, its cheek so close to the
water that it must swing open every time a riverboat wants to pass.
Across the Hudson River rise the Palisades, now shorn of foliage.
And above that, the setting sun is a back light to a thick
gathering of clouds.
</P>
<P>
   My friend remembers going there before the park was fixed up in
1994, when it was more woody than it is now, and watching icebergs
course down the river. She suspects the presence of ghosts. She
says she imagines it as the setting of a Nordic fairy tale, a place
to be alone in the fjords.
</P>
<P>
   Like many places in the city, the Spuyten Duyvil park feels as
if it isn't of the city at all. For those of us who feel safer in
familiar urban climes, all you need do is climb back up the hill
and crane back your neck. The familiar red and gray towers of the
Bronx are right there.
</P>
<P>
   It's fitting that the easiest way to get to the park is to ride
Metro North: a small, old-fashioned station sits at the edge of the
Hudson. It may be the best place from which to catch the end-of-day
light.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Women: you can't live with 'em and can't live
without 'em. They were confined to the kitchen, the nursery and the
realm of sexual fantasies for centuries, till sprung from the first
two by the march of history. But artists have most often put them
on one pedestal or another, disguised as goddesses, queens,
aristocrats, saints or courtesans.
</P>
<P>
   Photography has done its best to keep up with this artistic
tradition, though the medium isn't well equipped to deal with
saints or other divinities, sex goddesses excepted. Yet as the
major documentary instrument of the last two centuries, the camera
has had to turn its attention to all manner of women without a
pedestal to their names.
</P>
<P>
   Now Annie Leibovitz has tackled the subject of American women in
a book simply called ``Women'' (Random House) and a show of the
same name, comprising some 70 portraits, at the Corcoran Gallery of
Art here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women'' is a bafflingly big topic if ever there was one, and
photographs alone could scarcely be expected to express the breadth
and depth and complications of the subject. In the book, Susan
Sontag, trying to make a case for the topic, says at one point that
``men, unlike women, are not a work in progress.'' (Looked at from
another angle, men  &UR; are &LR;  a work in progress; it's just that they
appear to be progressively unraveling.)
</P>
<P>
   Maybe women are still being defined, and certainly neither women
nor society have come to terms with the changing vicissitudes of
the female sex, but photographic portraits tell limited tales.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Leibovitz is probably the most popular portraitist in
America, her show of celebrity portraits having been the museum
equivalent of an Austin Powers movie in box-office drawing power.
Her compendium of women is mixed in approach and results, some
portraits being robust, some pointed and some lovely, while others,
not surprisingly, are less compelling. The message seems to be that
women today work in diverse fields and achieve on diverse levels,
sometimes way up there, though AIDS and domestic abuse should not
be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, relatively cheerful news, but not exactly banner
headlines. What  &UR; is &LR;  news is the color, which is ravishing, and the
print process, which is computerized.
</P>
<P>
   Another show by Ms. Leibovitz opens at the Edwynn Houk Gallery
in New York on Jan. 20: nudes for the Pirelli 2000 Calendar
(Pirelli is the British tire manufacturer), from a series of body
studies of the Mark Morris Dancers. ``Women'' is such a catchall
title that this show is also named ``Women.'' Well, the word covers
a sex, a multitude of sins and evidently more than one artistic
genre.
</P>
<P>
   Since few of the women in the Washington show are entertainers,
the images are generally less theatrical, amusing and outrageous
than Ms. Leibovitz's earlier portraits of people like Whoopi
Goldberg in a tub of milk or Roseanne wrestling in the mud with her
husband. There is, however, the model (and erstwhile wife of Mick
Jagger) Jerry Hall looking disdainful in peroxide hair,
tiger-striped fur, gold stilettos and ankle bracelet while suckling
her naked baby with one exposed breast.
</P>
<P>
   Other sitters range from the known to the unknown, from Ms.
Leibovitz's mother to the Secretary of State, in color and black
and white, and since Ms. Leibovitz keeps ingeniously reinventing
herself, her approach is highly varied. Hillary Rodham Clinton is
seen in a light so pellucid and colors so pure she might have been
painted by Maxfield Parrish. Martina Navratilova bends to grip a
huge, steel, industrial wheel as if she were the workman in a
famous photograph by Lewis Hine. The painter Agnes Martin, in a
bedroom as spare as her paintings, looks like a homeless person in
temporary housing. Four Kilgore College Rangerettes, viewed from
below, kick so high their legs obscure their faces _ less a
portrait than a crotch shot.
</P>
<P>
   Up to date as always, Ms. Leibovitz's photographs occasionally
point up the current trend to confession and display even in
portraiture. A few people, including one sad old woman photographed
in a public bathroom, are quite willing to expose every pore and
wrinkle to a gimlet-eyed lens; this might be called the
dermatological approach to portraits. Performance artists and one
or two less public women throw in their naked bodies or random body
parts, openness and lack of shame having become identifying marks
of hip-ness.
</P>
<P>
   The popular notion of femininity as a construct gets striking
visual confirmation here in two portraits of a Las Vegas show girl.
In one, she wears an extravagant gold-beaded headdress, gold-beaded
monokini and gold-pleated cape to show off her bare breasts and
belly _ a woman costumed in femaleness, her bejewelled nakedness
the uniform of allure. In the companion picture, where she subsides
into black and white, she reverses the cliche of those old movies
where Plain Jane took off her specs and let down her hair: she has
short hair, glasses and little makeup, the guise of a
pleasant-looking woman who might have any number of identities but
not first and foremost that of sex object.
</P>
<P>
   The ambiguous states that so grip contemporary society are well
represented: a performance artist whose naked body appears
incontrovertibly female yet who spots a beard and mustache; Ms.
Olympia 1990-95, whose back and shoulder muscles far surpass almost
any man's you can name; Albita, a singer with dark lipstick and eye
shadow and a man's haircut and suit.
</P>
<P>
   As to the color: it revels in autumnal shades of green and
russet. A law professor sits in a rust-colored chair in a pale
green room beneath a painted portrait of a woman wearing a
rust-colored blouse in a gray-green room. Justices Ruth Bader
Ginsburg and Sandra Day O'Connor, in judicial robes with delicate
jabots, pose before reddish wood paneling and an olive green wall,
where a gold picture frame comments on O'Connor's blond hair.
</P>
<P>
   Made from traditional photographs, these pictures have been
scanned into a computer, color-corrected, then printed on
watercolor paper by an Iris (that's the brand name) ink-jet
printer. Ink-jet printers print not by chemical means on a
photographic emulsion but by laying down ink from hundreds of tiny
nozzles per square inch. These pictures are then pieced together
from two or four prints _ seams are visible from a short distance _
mounted and displayed without the interference of glass.
</P>
<P>
   Because many of the photographs are grainy when so enlarged, the
color breaks up; up close, tiny, wavering areas of pink or blue or
both exist within one tone. The result is soft and impressionistic,
more like an autochrome from the early part of the century than
color photographs today. No reproduction could do them justice.
</P>
<P>
   Iris prints are showing up in more and more galleries lately.
They are probably more newsworthy, as it happens, than most groups
of women you can name.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Annie Leibovitz: Women'' is at the Corcoran Gallery of Art,
17th Street and New York Avenue, NW, Washington, (202) 639-1700,
through April 3.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Ron Rifkin turns red, the first impulse of any
sane person is to duck. A red Ron Rifkin means that whatever
character this fine actor is playing is erupting into a shower of
venom, and it's a fearsome phenomenon. Remembered most vividly as
the irate publisher of Jon Robin Baitz's ``Substance of Fire,''
Rifkin is now exercising his spleen at the Eugene O'Neill Theater,
and he can still throw a tantrum to singe the scenery.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, though, the heat waves never get past the edge of the
stage this time around. Playing an obscure poet of infinite bile in
``Wrong Mountain,'' David Hirson's windy, satiric fable of the
contemporary theater, the lean-faced Rifkin looks just right, like
a David Levine caricature in The New York Review of Books, all wiry
lines, pinched nostrils and academic forehead.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately Levine's drawings have more flesh on them than
Hirson's characters do. Even in highest dudgeon, Rifkin can not
disguise that what he is portraying is a walking, screaming sheaf
of ideas, meant to be weighed against other sides of an open,
unsolvable debate. By the evening's end, after his character has
gone through some imposed, magical reversals, Rifkin seems more or
less to have given up. You can't blame him.
</P>
<P>
   Adventurous new plays of ideas are rare on Broadway. Actually,
make that new plays period, since ``Wrong Mountain'' is the only
one running at the moment. What's more, it's a play about the
theater, something for which Hirson clearly has a lively if
complicated passion, informed by hard experience (he is the author
of the 1991 cult flop ``La Bete'') and a healthy gift for seeing
all sides of an issue.
</P>
<P>
   So it would be especially satisfying to embrace ``Wrong
Mountain,'' which tells the story of how Rifkin's pedantic poet
disdainfully enters (and wins) a playwriting contest on a bet. Yet
under the distancing direction of Richard Jones, who collaborated
to more virtuosic effect with Hirson on ``La Bete,'' the work gives
the overall impression of a very thin organism with a big set of
lungs. It screams, it rants, it talks itself blue; but it finally
fails to engage those watching it, even when it is insulting them.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``La Bete'' _ a Molieresque comedy set not only in the 17th
century but also in rhyming couplets _ ``Wrong Mountain'' is built
around the destructive presence of a human juggernaut. Whereas that
figure in ``La Bete'' was a philistine in a rarefied theatrical
world, Rifkin's character, Henry Dennett, is a self-proclaimed
aesthete in a world of philistines.
</P>
<P>
   Cultural mediocrity is to him what Communism was to Joseph
McCarthy. He sees it lurking everywhere, even in the form of an
admiring young poet who ill-advisedly asks Henry for his autograph
in a bookshop. The greatest object of his wrath, however, is the
contemporary theater _ an arena, not incidentally, in which Guy
Halperin (Michael Winters), the fiance of Henry's ex-wife (Beth
Dixon), has become a fat success.
</P>
<P>
   You may find yourself pausing before the quaint idea of the
American theater today as an avenue to mainstream success. (Has it
made a household name out of anyone in recent years, except
possibly, thanks to Disney, Julie Taymor?)
</P>
<P>
   Still, the rancorous Henry isn't the most clear-sighted of
fellows. At a family Christmas gathering, he excoriates Guy's
profession for producing ``the kind of sanctimonious kitsch that's
embraced as high art by an audience of suburban morons dimwitted
enough to believe that by going to a play they're having some sort
of `cultural experience.'''
</P>
<P>
   Such provocations lead to Henry's bet that he can get a play
produced in six months' time, which in turn leads him to an exurban
theater festival, overseen by the florid, fatuous and ultimately
rather touching Maurice (Daniel Davis, in the evening's one
performance to win over the audience).
</P>
<P>
   There, Henry continues to advance his disdainful theories, most
articulately in the presence of an awkward but intelligent young
playwright (nicely played by Daniel Jenkins), who diffidently but
firmly bests the older man on his own terms. At the same time,
Henry drinks from a mystic fountain that will turn him into
everything he despises.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Hirson refuses to slant his debates. The problem
is that neither he nor Jones makes those arguments dramatically
compelling or even, for that matter, much fun. The
equal-opportunity satire ranges from portrayals of the competitive
intellectualism within Henry's family (Ilana Levine and Bruce
Norris play the son and daughter for whom sneering is a conditioned
reflex) to the touchy-feely antics of the provincial theater
troupe.
</P>
<P>
   The comedy is scattershot, often glancing off its targets. There
are a couple of laugh-out-loud moments during the theater festival
scenes, especially when the actors introduce themselves to Henry.
``Thank you for your anger,'' says one of them, while another
presents herself saying, ``I shall have the great, great honor to
read the role of the Seahag.''
</P>
<P>
   That Seahag line is priceless, a dead-on rendering of actorly
inflation. But it isn't heartening to know that it is, for me at
least, the evening's high point. Like the last new comedy to open
on Broadway, ``Epic Proportions'' (which has since closed), ``Wrong
Mountain'' has enough funny material to create a lively television
sketch, but not much more.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the jokes are bizarrely on the level of second-tier
sitcoms, like the business of having Maurice always getting Henry's
name wrong. Such facile bits are out of whack with the show's more
outrageous comic elements, including that symbolic 40-foot worm
that has taken up residence in Henry's intestine.
</P>
<P>
   For all its conscious audacity, there is a strange uncertainty
about the tone of ``Wrong Mountain'' that Jones hasn't managed to
translate into a consistent style. Giles Cadle's sets are
cartoonish without being especially witty, and the performers have
trouble negotiating the sharp turns from parody into
sentimentality.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the first act, Henry, still ranting about
theatergoers, declaims, ``They go to bask in the flattering image
of themselves as people who are open enough to have their values
challenged, which is just another way of saying that they go to the
theater to have their values confirmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Point taken. But for theater to pierce an audience's
complacency, it needs to have a vigor, sharpness and authority that
``Wrong Mountain'' never quite musters. You can't, after all,
pierce the skin with a blunt instrument.

<P>
   If you love French antiques, you are out of luck. January is
Americana month. Museum curators, scholars and collectors fly into
New York from all over the United States for the Winter Antiques
Show, the Americana sales at the auction houses and gallery shows.
</P>
<P>
   The buzz this year is about the Joseph and Bathsheba Pope
Valuables Cabinet, a 16-inch-tall chest made in Salem Village (now
Danvers), Mass., in 1679. Christie's has devoted an entire catalog
to it. The chest goes on view tomorrow and is to be auctioned next
Friday. The estimate is a minimum of $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   The chest is a rare survivor from the 1600s, the so-called
pilgrim century _ a dangerous time when most colonists were more
worried about survival than furniture. No ordinary piece, it is a
fancy chest commissioned for a wealthy client. ``Think of it as a
safe,'' said Philip Zea, curator of furniture at Colonial
Williamsburg. ``It's definitely parlor furniture and was meant to
be shown off.''
</P>
<P>
   Made of hand-riven oak, with cedar moldings, walnut decorations
and maple bun feet, the chest weighs 19 and a half pounds. In style
it is a full-blown expression of its period, with applied decor on
the front and carved sides. ``It's similar to chests made the same
time in Hartford and Wethersfield, Conn.,'' Zea said. ``They also
combine strapwork and applied decoration.''
</P>
<P>
   The geometric front seems to be Renaissance-inspired. Its door
has two ebonized columnar spindles glued on each side of an
octagonal plaque. Inside that plaque is a smaller octagon with a
sunburst motif and carved initials that stand for Joseph and
Bathsheba Pope.
</P>
<P>
   The door hides 10 drawers, which retain their original round,
hand-hammered brass pulls. The key and one drawer are missing, and
three small wood appliques have fallen off the front. The case,
feet, hinges and lock appear to be original.
</P>
<P>
   Zea said that the drawers probably held jewelry, money, deeds
and writing materials. ``This is a very specialized piece,'' he
said. ``It would serve as a desk if placed on top of a table.''
</P>
<P>
   The elaborate S scrolls carved in the sides seem to have been
inspired by the Mannerist carved oak paneling produced in Norfolk,
England. The cabinet is not signed but is attributed to James
Symonds (1636-1714), a joiner in Salem whose father immigrated from
Norfolk.
</P>
<P>
   It has been in the same family since 1679. ``The family must
have revered it because it was obviously very well taken care of,''
said Dean Levy, a Manhattan antiques dealer. ``It's never been
cleaned or shellacked. You pay a big premium today for something
that hasn't been altered. It's not perfect, but you'd really worry
if it didn't have some problems after 321 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Clarence Prickett, a dealer in Yardley, Pa., said, ``It's
incredibly rare, has a great look, a great provenance, and has a
lot going for it.''
</P>
<P>
   It has a great story as well.
</P>
<P>
   Last year a brother and sister on Cape Cod inherited the chest
from their mother. They didn't know what it was, so they took it to
an appraisal event at a local historical society. ``It caused quite
a bit of excitement,'' said the brother, a builder of wood boats,
who requested anonymity. ``We knew it was very old, but we didn't
know it was 17th century. By family tradition it was always called
the Franklin Chest, but nobody knew why. All I could remember was
that it sat in the entrance to my grandmother's house when I was a
boy.''
</P>
<P>
   After a summer of research, which involved studying the Mormon
genealogy site on the Internet, he was able to trace 13 generations
of his family. ``What sent chills up my spine was when we figured
out who the chest was built for,'' he said. It was made to
commemorate the 1679 marriage of Joseph Pope (1650-1712) and
Bathsheba Folger (1652-1726).
</P>
<P>
   History buffs may recall that Mrs. Pope was one of the first
witnesses at the Salem witchcraft trials of John Proctor and Martha
Corey in 1692. She was also Benjamin Franklin's aunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would never have been able to figure this out 10 years
ago,'' the boat builder said. ``I didn't even have a computer then.
Finding all this out was sheer luck and perseverance and
pigheadedness.''
</P>
<P>
   At some point last summer he realized the value of the chest.
``I told my sister, `We can't afford to own this,''' he said. ``The
insurance alone would be too much. It belongs in a museum.''
</P>
<P>
   They turned to an American-furniture expert, a New Hampshire
dealer, who sent them to Christie's. Martha Willoughby and John
Hays of Christie's showed the brother two other nearly identical
chests, one at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, made for the Herrick
family, and the other at Winterthur Museum in Wilmington, Del.,
made for the Hart family. None of the chests are signed, but all
three have been attributed to Symonds, who was related to the
Popes, the Herricks and the Harts.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the story is sad.
</P>
<P>
   The Popes were related to the Southwicks. ``I traced my ancestry
to the Southwicks, who are the founders of our line,'' the boat
builder said. ``Sarah Southwick's daughter married my
great-great-great-great-grandfather, Thomas Buffington, and they
had one of the chests.'' (The family's genealogy chart is in the
Christie's catalog.)
</P>
<P>
   The Southwicks were Quakers, he continued. ``Quakers were
severely persecuted in Salem in the mid-1600s. It's not generally
known that less than 20 years after the arrival of the Pilgrims
religious persecution against the Quakers began. They were banished
from the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The Southwicks were probably in
their 60s when they were driven out.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple took refuge on Shelter Island, in Long Island Sound.
``They were there less than a month before they died, and they died
within a day of each other,'' he added. ``They are buried there.''
</P>
<P>
   The chest had stayed with their daughter in Salem. ``This chest
is a snapshot into the interconnectedness of the whole Quaker
community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hays of Christie's said he found the chest to be ``a better
window into the 17th century than anything I've ever handled.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It brings together the cabinetmakers, first-generation
immigrants, the Salem witch trials and the founders of the
nation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hays displayed the chest in October at a symposium at
Christie's. Arthur Liverant, a dealer in Colchester, Conn., who saw
it there, said: ``I wish I'd found it. It's fantastic. There
weren't that many people in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in the
1760s, and there was very little stylish furniture. Few people
could afford all the extra options this chest has.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert Sack, dean of the Manhattan's Americana dealers, agreed.
``It's really remarkable for it to have survived,'' he said. ``It's
very rare and in remarkable condition. It's an important piece.''
</P>
<P>
   But the boat builder won't miss the chest. He's having a copy
made. How many consignors do that?

&HT;     THE SHRINE BOWL LURES SPURRIER BACK TO BAY AREA

<P>
   STANFORD, Calif. _ Steve Spurrier is still playing in John
Brodie's shadow, at least when the former quarterbacks hit the golf
course in various celebrity tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rarely beat him, that's for sure,'' Spurrier said. ``Well,
I've been beating him lately, but that's because he gives me six
shots every time we play.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Brodie was the main man in the 49ers' huddle in the '60s
and '70s, he's the superior golfer now. Of course, it helps that
Brodie has made a second career of golf, competing on the PGA
Seniors Tour and spending every available minute working on his
putting game.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to coaching college football, however, Spurrier is
in a class of his own. He was the winningest coach in the '90s, and
his Florida Gators won the 1996 national championship. The school
had a so-so program before Spurrier arrived, and now it's a
perennial power.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Spurrier is in the Bay Area for the first time in six
years to coach the East squad in Saturday's Shrine Bowl at Stanford
Stadium. Last time he was here, 1994, was the last time he was a
Shrine coach.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview after Tuesday's practice, Spurrier suggested
that all those years backing up Brodie weren't necessarily a
nuisance, as it seemed at the time. In fact, they had a lot to do
with the success he's achieved as a coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe because I watched the game from the sidelines a whole
bunch, it helped me as far as calling the plays,'' Spurrier said.
``Maybe I learned more about what was going on, hopefully a little
better than a lot of people who stand on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, when you're a player, you want to play. But I sort
of look back now and am thankful I didn't play a lot because of the
injury factor and all that. I'm in good health. No concussions, no
serious problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard Todd, the old Jets quarterback, once told me, `If I
ever come back in a second life, I want to be a backup
quarterback.' He was right. The fans love you. You don't get hit.
You don't get hurt. You feel good when the game's over. And you
still get paid.''
</P>
<P>
   And you just may go on to boast the best winning percentage in
the history of the Southeastern Conference. Spurrier is the only
major college coach in the 20th century to win more than 90 games
in his first nine years at a school.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, Spurrier is coming off his most disappointing
season, one that began 9-1 and ended with three straight losses,
including a 37-34 downer to Michigan State in the Citrus Bowl. His
team finished 12th in the final ranking, falling from the top 10
for the first time since 1990 and failing to win 10 games for the
first time since '92.
</P>
<P>
   Is it finally time for Spurrier to accept an NFL offer and move
to the next level? Not a chance, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost our last three games, so I don't know if anyone wants
me anyway,'' he said with a smile. ``The thing is, I think most NFL
people realize what a wonderful situation I have in Florida. It's
my alma mater, and I really enjoy living in Florida. I've got too
good a job to look for another one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like the football team is going way downhill. We were
competitive. Three of our four losses, we were ahead in the second
half, but we couldn't quite hold the lead or score when we had
to.''
</P>
<P>
   For Spurrier's East squad, he brought along two Gators,
quarterback Doug Johnson and tackle Cooper Carlisle. The other East
quarterback is Michigan's Tom Brady.
</P>
<P>
   The West's quarterbacks are Stanford's Todd Husak and Arizona's
Keith Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the QB who endured Florida's three straight losses,
said playing for Spurrier is ``challenging _ he's a perfectionist.
He's got a great offense, a fun offense. He really opens it up. We
lost our last three games, and playing in the Shrine Bowl is a
chance for us to go out a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier said he certainly wants to win on Saturday, but he
understands the motive for many seniors is to show their worth for
NFL scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Spurrier is enjoying his rare visit to the Bay Area.
He has played golf with his son, Steve Jr. _ a receivers coach at
Oklahoma _ and introduced him to Fisherman's Wharf and the cable
cars.
</P>
<P>
   He dined with Steve Mariucci and the 49ers' brass and plans to
spend Thursday evening with several old 49er teammates, including
Frank Nunley, Larry Shreiber, Tommy Hart, Cas Banaszek and Len
Rohde.
</P>
<P>
   Brodie is unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fun trip,'' said Spurrier, the 49ers' top draft pick in
1967 after he won the Heisman Trophy at Florida. ``I looked forward
to coming out here. I didn't play a whole bunch when I was here,
but I really enjoyed the area.''

   NEW YORK _ Lincoln Center Theater is in final negotiations with
the Royal National Theater in London to bring Martin Sherman's
one-woman show ``Rose'' and its star, Olympia Dukakis, to Broadway
in March.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Gersten, the executive producer of Lincoln Center
Theater, said that if an agreement can be reached, the production
will begin performances on March 28 at the Lyceum Theater on West
45th Street before an April 12 opening. As it did with last year's
productions of ``Ring Around the Moon'' and ``Via Dolorosa,''
Lincoln Center Theater is producing this show away from its 65th
Street home because its two on-site theaters are already booked.
</P>
<P>
   The play, which was a surprise hit at the National's Cottesloe
Theater, tells the story of a postwar Jewish emigre who travels
from a small Ukrainian village to Miami Beach. Ms. Dukakis, sitting
on a small bench with minimal set dressing, plays Rose, holding
forth for nearly two hours in a personal recollection of a Jewish
diaspora.
</P>
<P>
   In a nod to that workload, the production will have only seven
performances a week, instead of the standard eight. Also limited is
the run, only eight and a half weeks. After that, there are
tentative plans to use the Lyceum for a revue of the American
theater, called ``The Broadway Hall of Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   For Sherman, an American who lives in Britain, the play would
mark a return to Broadway after an absence of more than 20 years.
His last Broadway production, ``Bent,'' which opened in 1979 and
concerned a relationship between two gay men in Nazi Germany, was
nominated for a Tony Award for best play.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Bishop, the artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater,
has a long professional relationship with Sherman, dating back to
Bishop's tenure as the artistic director of Playwrights Horizon.
``Martin is an old friend,'' Bishop said. ``And a great writer.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gentrifying Off-Off
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Is the Lower East Side getting too tony for
off-off-Broadway? That's the implication from the news this week
that the Present Co., which produces the New York International
Fringe Festival, was in danger of being evicted from its home, the
Theatorium.
</P>
<P>
   John Clancy, the Present Co.'s artistic director, said last
Friday that his company had received a notice from its landlord,
alleging that the company owed tens of thousands of dollars in
overdue rent, a charge Clancy denied. Legal help was sought, and a
call went out from the Theatorium for financial support. The
company started a campaign in hopes of raising $100,000, a figure
it says would settle affairs with its landlord as well as insure
next summer's Fringe festival.
</P>
<P>
   Similar money problems also beset another downtown theater
bastion, Todo Con Nada, on Ludlow Street, in December. That crisis
was again about rent, a shortfall of some $13,000. The threat of
eviction there passed after Aaron Beall, Nada's founder, asked for
$80 contributions from 167 ``friends of Nada,'' raising enough to
satisfy the landlord.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday, Clancy said more than $20,000 had been pledged and
it looked as though a settlement would be reached. A call to the
property's management, Brookshire Equities, was not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Still, both Clancy and Beall, who together founded the Fringe in
1997, say their rent problems underscore the increased
gentrification of their once-scrappy neighborhood _ a
gentrification, they say, that would not have been possible without
small theaters and performance spaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no law in this country against making money,'' said
Clancy, speaking of his landlords. ``But we intend to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   A Romantic Streak
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It should come as no surprise that Kevin Chamberlin
was once a high school heavyweight wrestling champ. After all, he
looks the part: big, bald and burly.
</P>
<P>
   But audiences for ``Dirty Blonde,'' which opened on Monday at
New York Theater Workshop, are seeing another side of this talented
actor, one that he himself never expected to play: the romantic
leading man.
</P>
<P>
   ``The male ingenue,'' Chamberlin said with a giggle. ``I never
thought those words would come out of my mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Ingenue might be a bit of a stretch _ or maybe just right _
considering Chamberlin's character, Charlie, has more than a
passing fancy for Mae West, and her clothes. What is certain,
though, is that Charlie is a departure for Chamberlin, who has
played more than his share of thugs, lugs and simpletons.
</P>
<P>
   A lifelong actor _ he is a self-described ``theater freak'' _
Chamberlin struggled to find his niche. ``When you're 22 and
bald,'' he said, ``there's not a lot of roles.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, however, he is on a hot streak. He received great
reviews for ``Dirty Blonde,'' a production that is mulling a
commercial run. And after his stint in ``Dirty Blonde,'' he begins
work on ``Seussical,'' the much-anticipated Dr. Seuss musical, in
which Chamberlin will play another romantic lead, of sorts: Horton
the Elephant.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a wide-eyed innocent,'' he said. ``We have a few things
in common.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Briton in `Superstar'
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Glenn Carter, a little-known British actor, was
playing the role of a disciple in a 1998 West End version of
``Jesus Christ Superstar'' but when the musical went on tour in
Britain he ascended to the part of Jesus of Nazareth. Now he'll
reprise that role when a revival of the Andrew Lloyd Weber musical
opens on April 16 at the Ford Center for the Performing Arts.
Carter, the only foreigner in an otherwise American cast, said he
has never been to New York. ``I'm excited to visit like this,'' he
said. ``It's far too important a place to go as a tourist.''
</P>
<P>
   A Threesome Again
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The writer Larry Gelbart, the composer Cy Coleman and
the lyricist David Zippel, the team behind 1989's Tony-bedecked
Hollywood musical ``City of Angels,'' have rejoined forces on a
more austere topic: the lives of Napoleon and Josephine. The
unnamed project is aiming for a tryout in the fall and a Broadway
production to be announced.  &QL;

IN HOLLYWOOD, IF IT'S WORTH DOING, IT SEEMS TO BE WORTH OVERDOING

c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a whole new century.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some say that it won't really be the 21st century
until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood appears to be operating on the latter assumption.
</P>
<P>
   A look at the movie releases planned for the year 2000 reveals a
preponderance of titles that seem very much like the movies we've
been watching for the last 100-odd years. Of course, short
descriptions don't indicate, at this point, if generic-sounding
films will turn out to be as innovative as, say, last year's ``The
Matrix'' or ``The Blair Witch Project'' or ``The Sixth Sense.''
Along the same lines, who knew in January of 1999 that the year's
most notable artistic triumphs would be the likes of ``American
Beauty,'' ``Three Kings,'' ``Boys Don't Cry'' and ``Being John
Malkovich,'' all works from little-known or even first-time
directors?
</P>
<P>
   That said, the new year's movie roster seems rather
unadventurous. Distributors are more or less sticking to the tried
and true; even the biggest genre trend, the outer space adventure,
is only forward-looking in the most old-school of ways, having been
a proven crowd-pleaser for the last quarter-century and the setting
for last year's biggest blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   The new movie millennium, will show us two fourth-rock landings
(``Mission to Mars'' and ``Red Planet''), Earth's existence
jeopardized in both a cartoon (``Titan A.E.'') and Scientological
context (L. Ron Hubbard's ``Battlefield Earth''), and Clint
Eastwood leading a bunch of grizzled ``Space Cowboys.'' Among other
alien encounters will be ``Pitch Black'' and Mike Nichols'
interspecies mating comedy ``What Planet Are You From?''
</P>
<P>
   You'll also _ big surprise _ be seeing lots of dead people.
Working the successful ``Sixth Sense'' concept will be Robert
Zemeckis' Harrison Ford-Michelle Pfeiffer chiller ``What Lies
Beneath,'' M. Night Shayamalan's return with ``Sense'' star Bruce
Willis in ``Unbreakable,'' and such eerily resonant titles as
``Soul Survivors,'' ``Waking the Dead,'' ``Final Destination,''
``Bless the Child,'' ``The Ninth Gate'' and ``The Cell.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, there's a bumper crop of movies with
similar-sounding themes that not only make you wonder if there are
any original minds left in Hollywood, but if so, why more than one
of them came up with these particular concepts.
</P>
<P>
   Get ready for three pep squads gone bad (``Sugar &AMP; Spice,''
``Cheer Fever,'' ``But I'm a Cheerleader''); twin mail-order brides
(''Dancing in the Dark,'' ``Birthday Girl''); a trio of urban
ethnic clashes (``Black &AMP; White,'' ``Romeo Must Die,'' ``Save the
Last Dance''); a quintet of live-action cartoons (``X-Men,'' ``102
Dalmatians,'' ``The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas,'' ``How the
Grinch Stole Christmas'' with Jim Carrey and ``The Adventures of
Rocky and Bullwinkle'' with Robert De Niro as Fearless Leader!);
and a trio of Sandra Bullock movies, at least two of which involve
support groups (``Gun Shy,'' ``28 Days,'' ``Miss Congeniality'').
</P>
<P>
   Then there's ``Bounce,'' in which Ben Affleck falls for the
widow (Gwyneth Paltrow) of a man whose death he was partially
responsible for. This should not be confused with ``Proof of
Life,'' which stars Russell Crowe as a kidnap return specialist who
falls in love with the wife (Meg Ryan) of a man he's trying to
free.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the most anticipated films of 2000 are, reassuringly,
sequels or remakes. Tom Cruise will be back in ``Mission:
Impossible 2.'' Samuel L. Jackson is the new ``Shaft.'' Nicolas
Cage speeds through a big-budget, recidivist ``Gone in 60
Seconds.'' Harold Ramis (``Analyze This'') remakes the witty '60s
comedy fantasy ``Bedazzled.'' Eddie Murphy does quintuple
heavy-makeup duty in ``Nutty 2: The Klumps.'' ``Charlie's Angels''
come bouncing back in a big-screen version starring Drew Barrymore,
Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu. Sylvester Stallone puts his unique spin
on the British cult crime classic ``Get Carter.''
</P>
<P>
   And on the cartoon front, the Rugrats go to Paris, Pooh's pal
Tigger gets his own movie, and the Pokemon come back. Even the most
anticipated animated feature, Disney's digital/live background
``Dinosaur,'' has more than a whiff of ``Jurassic'' nostalgia about
it.
</P>
<P>
   Those who prefer genuine nostalgia to the recycled kind should
have a good year, with everything from Hitchcock's ``Rear Window,''
Olivier's ``Hamlet,'' Claude Chabrol's ``Les Bonnes Femmes'' and
Billy Wilder's ``Sunset Blvd.'' to Andy Warhol's ``Trash'' and a
John Holmes porno movie scheduled for re-release.
</P>
<P>
   By now you're wondering, will there be anything new for the Big
Y2? Undoubtedly yes, but we can't predict what yet. Until we see
them, at least there are a number of big star vehicles that at
least might be worth looking forward to. Like Kevin Spacey as a
conventioneering salesman in ``The Big Kahuna.'' Or Tom Hanks
marooned on a desert island (``Cast Away''). How about Matt Damon
and Will Smith in the Robert Redford golf fantasy ``The Legend of
Bagger Vance,'' Mel Gibson's ``The Patriot'' winning the
Revolutionary War, Julia Roberts' ``Erin Brockovich'' boldly
battling polluters, or sailors George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg
facing down ``The Perfect Storm.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, all the movies probably really need to do this year
is put Leonardo DiCaprio back in the water. His tropics-set ``The
Beach'' party kicks off next month. &QL;

GLENN WHIPP'S FIVE MOVIE PICKS FOR 2000

<P>
   OK. Know this going in. Last year, sight unseen, I selected
these films as My Most Anticipated Movies of 1999: ``The Muse,''
``Bringing Out the Dead,'' ``Man on the Moon,'' ``The Wild Wild
West'' and ``All the Pretty Horses.''
</P>
<P>
   Of those five, the one I like the best was ``All the Pretty
Horses.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't come out last year.
</P>
<P>
   So it's with a little trepidation (and a little more thought)
that I give you my new and improved list of movies you won't want
to miss.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't say you weren't warned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dinosaur'': Could there be a safer bet? Those long trailers
shown before ``Toy Story 2'' looked great and Disney has spent
something like $200 million on this computer-animated Jurassic
tale. It will probably not only be the year's biggest hit, but also
a pretty darned good movie to boot.
</P>
<P>
   ``O Brother, Where Art Thou?'': The Coen brothers aren't perfect
(``The Hudsucker Proxy''), but they usually can be counted on to
make pretty interesting movies. With this chain gang comedy, Joel
and Ethan have the nerve to take on Homer's ``The Odyssey,'' and
something tells me their spin will be twisted, freakish and very,
very funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cast Away'': Tom Hanks hasn't made a bad film in years. Here
he reunites with ``Forrest Gump'' director Robert Zemeckis in a
realistic tale about what would happen to a man who is stranded on
a desert island. And nope, the Professor isn't on hand to help him
build all those bamboo contraptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaft'': Yes, it's a remake. But it's got the year's most
perfect casting: Sam Jackson as Shaft. I most definitely dig it.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the Pretty Horses'': Hey, if it was good enough to make my
list last year, why not press my luck? If anything, expectations
for Billy Bob Thornton's adaptation of the Cormac McCarthy novel
have only increased because of star Matt Damon's fine turn in ``The
Talented Mr. Ripley.'' Then again, there could be a reason why this
film was delayed. Keep your fingers crossed. &QL;

BOB STRAUSS' FIVE MOVIE PICKS FOR 2000

<P>
   Well, I see no reason to apologize for my
films-to-look-forward-to picks of January 1999. After all, this
time last year, everyone else thought ``Eyes Wide Shut'' would be a
masterpiece so, by comparison, my choices of ``Anywhere but Here''
(granted, that one sucked), ``Cradle Will Rock'' (interesting),
``Fight Club'' (weirdly interesting), ``Summer of Sam''
(underappreciated) and ``Magnolia'' (hey, my favorite film of the
year) seem pretty decent.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, however, you'll have another opportunity to make fun
of me for calling the following to your attention:
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm a Cheerleader'': If it lives up to the satirical
promise of its title, this story about a teen-age girl wrongly
committed to a lesbian deprogramming camp should be one hoot of a
social comedy. I mean, RuPaul without makeup? What could be
funnier?
</P>
<P>
   ``Me, Myself and Irene'': I never thought I'd welcome the
prospect of Jim Carrey going back to over-the-top comedy. But after
that dreary Andy Kaufman thing, a rematch with the Farrelly
brothers (``Dumb and Dumber,'' ``There's Something About Mary'')
sounds like the most sublime of silliness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Perfect Storm'': Wolfgang Petersen knows something about
directing seaborne suspense (witness ``Das Boot''), so this
adaptation of Sebastian Junger's non-fiction best seller about one
mama of a Nor'easter and the fishermen caught by it ought to be
pretty gripping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shadow of the Vampire'': The ultimate film buff concept turned
into a real horror movie: A great German director hires a real
bloodsucker to star in his classic film. The fact that reborn king
of cinema cool John Malkovich headlines _ and Willem Dafoe seems
perfectly cast as the biter _ gives the project instant
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``X-Men'': The most popular comic book of the last couple of
decades could actually mutate into an exciting movie under the
directing hand of Bryan Singer (``The Usual Suspects''). We know
there'll be studio pressure to dumb and dull it into a Batman-like
franchise, but with luck, the intelligence of Singer and the source
material will overcome such evil. &QL;

HOW ONE ROLE MADE BOGART INTO AN ICON  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 16)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 Michael Sragow writes about film for Salon.Com and is working on a
biography of the director Victor Fleming.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Humphrey Bogart was born on Christmas Day in
1899, and we're sure to be inundated this year with juicy
behind-the-scenes tales about the making of beloved hits like
``Casablanca'' and ``The Big Sleep.'' But the movie that marked him
as a towering star who would redefine crime movies, and action
films in general, was Raoul Walsh's stirring 1941 melodrama ``High
Sierra.''
</P>
<P>
   This film proved to be the end of the line for the old-time
gangster film and the beginning of genres like film noir and the
anti-western, which challenged knee-jerk public morality and
expressed ambivalence toward violent men.
</P>
<P>
   This combination of provocation and ambiguity has pervaded our
adult popular culture ever since: a circa-``High Sierra'' shot of
Bogart flashed on the screen in the first episode of ``The
Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of its influence derives from the 1940 novel by W.R.
Burnett, who is still best known for his 1929 novel, ``Little
Caesar,'' the basis of the first big gangster talkie. Burnett's
writing has an all-American, Jack London-like mix of veracity and
pulp intensity, urban smarts and atavistic yearning, sympathy for
the dispossessed and lionization of the superior individual.
</P>
<P>
   His emphasis on a manly code rooted in the gut, tested in action
and connected to trust and honor (even among thieves), is related
to Hemingway's. And in ``High Sierra'' Burnett locates the point
where American individualism meets existentialism. ``You always
hope you can get out,'' says the former dime-a-dance gal, Marie, to
the aging gangster, Roy Earle. ``That sort of keeps you going.''
</P>
<P>
   But much of the film's influence also comes from Bogart's
ability _ with the help of John Huston, who wrote the screenplay
with Burnett, and Walsh, who directed _ to turn an existential mood
into something irresistibly iconic. In Bogart's breakthrough
performance, it settles over Earle's dark suit like a battered
trench coat.
</P>
<P>
   Huston had already written one film Bogart had acted in _ the
clever, shallow ``Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse.'' But that script gave
Bogart a stock gangster role. ``High Sierra'' was a different
story. Roy (Mad Dog) Earle is the last great cornfed bandit _ an
Indiana desperado modeled on John Dillinger _ and this picture
chronicles his final job.
</P>
<P>
   When it opened 59 years ago this week, The New York Times called
it a ``Wagnerian'' valedictory, ``befitting a first-string god.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie established Huston and Bogart's friendship and
creative partnership. With Huston turning writer-director, he and
Bogart went on to make ``The Maltese Falcon,'' ``Across the
Pacific,'' ``The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,'' ``Key Largo,''
``The African Queen'' and ``Beat the Devil'' _ arguably the most
diverse and compelling credits ever compiled by an American
actor-director team.
</P>
<P>
   Although Huston was only the co-writer, ``High Sierra'' deserves
a place near the top of that list. (It returns to the small screen
in March as part of Warner Home Video's new Bogart Collection.)
From the start it snags the viewer in a vortex of existential doom.
A bedridden crime boss named Big Mac engineers Roy Earle's pardon
so he can lead a heist that Mac has planned at a ritzy California
resort, Tropico Springs.
</P>
<P>
   But when Earle drives to the High Sierra fishing spot where he's
supposed to wait for the go-ahead, he finds that his inside man,
Louis Mendoza (Cornel Wilde), has feet of clay and a big mouth,
while his safecrackers, Red (Arthur Kennedy) and Babe (Alan
Curtis), have done the unthinkable and brought along a dame, Marie
(Ida Lupino).
</P>
<P>
   Earle's nightmare memories of the Big House are matched by his
overripe nostalgia for the family farm. It leads him to form an
ill-advised friendship with a pair of displaced Ohio farmers (Henry
Travers and Elisabeth Risdon) and their wide-eyed, club-footed
granddaughter, Velma (Joan Leslie). He even grows attached to an
ownerless dog, which turns out to be a harbinger of death.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing Earle does is learn that Marie is better for him
than Velma _ and that life is better lived without illusions. But
he can't escape the defects that Big Mac has built into the caper,
and he can't outwit a modern radio-car dragnet when he takes to the
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   In a finale that's like Billy Wilder's ``Ace in the Hole'' done
in a matter of minutes, police pin Bogart down in sight of Mount
Whitney and reporters make him the center of a media circus.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Behlmer's book ``Inside Warner Bros. (1935-1951)''
documents how important this movie was to Huston and Bogart. ``It
would be very easy for this to be made into the conventional
gangster picture,'' Huston wrote to the producer Hal Wallis,
``which is exactly what it should not be.'' Huston was an avowed
Burnett fan. (He would also direct Jean-Paul Sartre's landmark
existential play ``No Exit'' on Broadway in 1946.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bogart jockeyed to play the leading role. ``You told
me once to let you know when I found a part I wanted,'' Bogart
wrote Wallis. ``A few weeks ago I left a note for you concerning
`High Sierra.'''
</P>
<P>
   According to A.M. Sperber and Eric Lax's ``Bogart,'' the actor
had read the novel before publication, in Redbook magazine, and
knew it was for him. He also knew that he was third or fourth in
the studio players' hard-guy hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, Paul Muni quit the studio after Warner Brothers refused
to produce a Beethoven biography for him to star in. And Bogart
himself encouraged George Raft to turn down ``High Sierra'' by
telling him that Roy Earle would merely be one more tough guy
biting the dust. With Huston supporting his candidacy, Bogart got
the role.
</P>
<P>
   Bogart's gritty charisma and tensile authority have kept the
film emotionally fresh. We live in a climate where stars strive to
stay youthful. But as Earle gets out of a life sentence after eight
years in the pen, Bogart strides into view with a hatchet-job
haircut and gray on the sides, a worn black suit and hat and a look
of hard-boiled melancholy.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, he sets the movie's dominant texture of electric
rumination. When an anonymous thug picks up Earle outside the
prison gate, Earle directs him to the nearest park, where he tries
to relax on a bench as kids play and a trash collector spears a
front page that happens to have Earle's mug on it. The way Bogart
plays Earle, everything about him says, ``Don't rush me.''
</P>
<P>
   So when he moves into action, his speed and precision are doubly
dumbfounding. Earle knows times have changed when orders from Big
Mac come down through an ex-cop named Kranmer (played by Barton
MacLane). ``He calls the tune and you dance to it,'' the burly
Kranmer tells the reedy Earle _ who instantly whacks him with an
open hand on both sides of his face. Earle doesn't dance for
anyone: a misfit individualism led him into crime in the first
place. And only Bogart could so blithely slap Barton MacLane.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Earle fit into the Bogart persona that would fuel six
decades of bad nightclub impersonations. But the tightening of the
upper lip, the dialogue delivered through a sneer, the slouched yet
forward-tilting posture, the hands that swiftly part his jacket and
smooth his belt line and check his pockets, as if he's frisking
himself, are here convincing parts of a wary crime vet's armor.
</P>
<P>
   Other reflexes come into play whenever Earle gets desperate: his
cheeks quiver uncontrollably when he holds up a general store, and
he bares his teeth like a big cat when he fears he's about to be
cornered.
</P>
<P>
   Bogart had shown portions of this acting arsenal before _
notably as Baby Face Martin in the 1937 screen version of Sidney
Kingsley's play ``Dead End.'' (Bogart's famous turn as Duke Mantee
in the 1936 film of Robert Sherwood's ``The Petrified Forest''
hasn't aged as well; Bogart created Mantee on Broadway and in the
movie is gratingly stagy.)
</P>
<P>
   ``High Sierra'' gave him far more range. There's a crackling
newness to his dry kinesthetic poetry. He masters a dynamic
stillness and generates an air of concentration that expands the
space around his lines. And his idiosyncratic style suits the role.
Roy Earle is at odds with the world. Bogart contrasts surely and
steadily with every other player in it.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Donald MacBride delivers a wonderful, beaming
performance as Big Mac _ each fleeting impulse this man has
registers in his face, from his thirst for hard drink to his
despair over partnering up Earle with unworthy soda jerks and
jitterbugs. Bogart, on the other hand, barely shifts expression.
His Earle doesn't want anyone to see to the bottom of him, not even
Big Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Bogart funnels all of Earle's senses and emotions into a state
of generalized alertness. Even his pals must learn to ``read'' him.
Early on, Marie, afraid of being sent away from camp, lets Earle
know that she knows about the resort heist _ and that his inside
man tipped her off to it.
</P>
<P>
   Bogart makes Earle brighten from the inside out: he respects
Marie's intelligence. But when Earle feels vulnerable, or shamed,
he clouds over and clams up.
</P>
<P>
   This movie is about a man moving through unfamiliar territory to
what Shakespeare called ``the undiscovered country.'' Driving
around Tropico Springs in his dark suit, Bogart's Earle doesn't
lose his feral grace, but he looks as out of place as an undertaker
(or as Nixon on a beach). He doesn't fully accept that, as
Dillinger put it, he's ``rushing toward death.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades to come, Earle's stew of conflict and sentiment and
inchoate impulse would bubble up in the best American action and
suspense films _ in crime epics or films noir like Huston's
``Asphalt Jungle'' (from another Burnett novel), in westerns like
``The Naked Spur'' and ``The Wild Bunch,'' in POW flicks like
``Stalag 17'' and ``The Great Escape'' (which Burnett helped
write).
</P>
<P>
   If ``High Sierra'' has been overshadowed by its successors, it's
probably because of Velma and her club foot. Walsh, the director,
couldn't figure out how to signal that Velma and her grandparents
are projections of Earle's nostalgic imagination, not just cornball
cliches.
</P>
<P>
   For too long, Earle's quest to cure Velma of her limp _ and thus
win her hand in marriage _ comes off as mawkish instead of
self-deluded. But the crucial confrontations are rock-hard,
including those between Bogart and Lupino _ a match made in
underworld heaven.
</P>
<P>
   She rises to the film's summation. Over Earle's dead body, she
asks a cynical reporter to tell her what it means ``when a man
crashes out.'' He says, ``It means he's free.'' She repeats the
word ``free'' as her face fills the frame and passes out of it, and
the camera tilts up to take in the high country behind her. Rarely
has it been so jarring _ and so satisfying _ for a film to close
with the words ``The End.''

<P>
   Having just said goodbye to the 20th century with an
invigorating spate of rule-bending movies, you might think we'd be
looking forward to the cinematic roller coaster ride of our lives
in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it looks like we'll be hopping on the usual
merry-go-round of remakes (``Shaft''), rehashes (``Scream 3'') and
regressive formula movies (``Crime and Punishment in Suburbia'')
that Hollywood has been mindlessly churning out for years. Looking
for the next ``Being John Malkovich'' or ``American Beauty''? So
are we. And we don't see the equivalent on this list.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nobody saw ``The Blair Witch Project'' coming last
year. (This year, the prequel will be out by Halloween.) So we're
keeping our fingers crossed for a surprise or two _ not to mention
a few good films by May. (Take a look at the list. The pickings
seem slim.)
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that the release dates are fluid to the point of
being meaningless. Some of these movies will switch slots several
times; some won't even be released at all. And you know what? The
world will probably be a richer place because of it.
</P>

&HT;     BLACK COACHES IN THE NFL WALK THE PLANK 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By GWEN KNAPP  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ This looks horrible. The Green Bay Packers fired
their head coach after one year, when the team finished at .500,
and also dropped their offensive and defensive coordinators. All
three coaches are black, the first such trio in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   This looks horrible, too. The Bay Area had two defensive
coordinators, each of whom had been in his position for two years.
One took the Raiders' last-place defense and moved it into the top
10. The other took the 49ers' top-ranked defense and dropped it
into the NFL cellar. The Raiders' coordinator is a 56-year-old
black man with decades of experience. The 49ers' is 38 and white, a
relative newcomer.
</P>
<P>
   One of them was fired this week, and it wasn't the young white
man with the bad statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Was it racism that drove Ray Rhodes out of Green Bay so quickly?
Was it discrimination that shoved Willie Shaw out of Oakland? Are
the standards higher for black coaches than for white ones in the
NFL? I can't say. All I know is that it looks horrible. If it's not
discriminatory, it's certainly depressing.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 1, the NFL's 31 teams had a total of three head coaches
who were black and 10 black coordinators. By Jan.,12, the numbers
had dropped to two head coaches and seven coordinators, a 33
percent fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson's Rainbow-PUSH Coalition has asked for a
meeting with Packers administrators to discuss Rhodes' hasty
firing. Tampa Bay's Tony Dungy, one of the two black head coaches
left in the NFL, said on Wednesday that he considered Jackson's
efforts misdirected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't necessarily think that was the right way to go,
because, to me, the Packers made a move. They hired the guy, and
for whatever reason they decided not to continue with it,'' Dungy
said in an Associated Press story. ``I think we need to look at the
situations where they don't hire people, as opposed to the Packers'
situation, personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Dungy has never been an apologist for the poor track record of
hiring black coaches into the NFL. It's easy to understand why he
would defend the Packers, who hired Rhodes after the Philadelphia
Eagles had deteriorated under his command, making him the first
African American head coach to get a second chance in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   It's just as easy to see why the Raiders could laugh off any
hints of discrimination in their headquarters. They were the first
NFL team to hire a black head coach. They put black players on the
offensive line when it was considered the domain of white
``cerebral'' players. They've had a coach named Flores. They
currently have a top executive named Amy.
</P>
<P>
   When the Raiders replace Shaw, they are very likely to hire
another African American coordinator, possibly even Emmitt Thomas,
who worked with head coach Jon Gruden in Philadelphia and was part
of the purge in Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's no denying that Shaw's ouster was unusual. The
Raiders have justified it by saying that they expected Shaw to get
a head coaching job soon and that they needed to transfer his
``supervisory'' designation to secondary coach Chuck Bresnahan so
that other teams wouldn't steal him away.
</P>
<P>
   But they could have lifted the supervisory title without canning
Shaw. They let him go for other reasons, reportedly because he and
Gruden weren't in sync, because Shaw was deemed inflexible, and
because the team lost several games on late defensive collapses.
And, oh yes, because this Raiders team underachieved quite
spectacularly and someone had to pay.
</P>
<P>
   All of these reasons make sense, and there are always reasons
for firing employees. There are even more reasons for not hiring
people in the first place. But when those people are black coaches,
the reasons just seem to multiply and then slip under a magnifying
glass.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw couldn't find harmony with Gruden? No racism there, right?
But how did the tow-headed, 36-year-old Gruden become the wonder
kid of the NFL while Shaw, who had a longer, better history, had to
play his underling?
</P>
<P>
   Shaw is inflexible? Sounds like Bill Parcells, Jimmy Johnson,
Tom Coughlin, Buddy Ryan, Vince Lombardi.,.,.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders' defense fell apart in crucial games? The offense
vanished at least as often as the defense, and Gruden's poor clock
management in the Monday night game in Denver cost the Raiders a
playoff spot. Yet Gruden kept his job, and his reputation as a
rising star.
</P>
<P>
   If Shaw gets a head-coaching job, the sting of his Oakland
firing will disappear. Everything will look less horrible. He has
already interviewed with New England and expects more contacts. But
he fears, quite understandably, that the Raiders' dismissal will
hurt his chances.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes may land somewhere else, too, though his prospects for a
head coaching job are slim. Green Bay had good reasons to be
dissatisfied with his performance, and his departure wouldn't look
so horrible if the rest of the NFL had hired more diverse coaching
staffs.
</P>
<P>
   Dungy pointed out that Rhodes' fate was similar to that of Chan
Gailey, who spent two years as head coach of the Cowboys, went to
the playoffs both seasons and still got the ax.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes with the territory,'' Dungy said.
</P>
<P>
   But the territory isn't trod by nearly enough African Americans.
That's why one fired head coach and three dumped coordinators add
up to a 33 percent drop. That's why it looks horrible.

 &HT;    Before it was a movie, `Bambi' was a book
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Simon &AMP; Schuster has released a new
edition of Felix Salten's novel ``Bambi.'' The book has been
abridged and is illustrated in a realistic style by Steve Johnson
and Lou Fancher.
</P>
<P>
   Salten's novel is, of course, the basis for the Disney animated
movie, and this adaptation retains Salten's essential message that
animals and nature are equally sacred.
</P>
<P>
   Publisher Max Schuster brought out the book in 1928 _ it was
published in Germany five years earlier _ with a translation by,
believe it or not, Whittaker Chambers. After the rise of Hitler,
Schuster helped get Salten, a Jew, out of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   PATTERNS IN THE SAND
</P>
<P>
   A recent Gallup Poll offered mildly heartening news. It reported
that most Americans read just about as much as they did 20 years
ago, that they prefer nonfiction to fiction and that the Internet
has little impact on book choices. Women read more than men, and 84
percent claim to have read all or part of a book in the past year,
up from 81 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 7 percent claim to be avid readers, tossing off more
than 50 books in the past year. Most disturbing was the 13 percent
who said they read no books, a figure that has climbed gradually
over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   `ELEMENTS OF STYLE,' REFASHIONED The value of the backlist is
shown by the recent publishing history of ``The Elements of
Style,'' the classic volume by William Strunk and E.B. White. Now
more than 80 years old, revised by White in 1959, and later in
1972, it was recently revised yet again by White's stepson, the
noted New Yorker writer Roger Angell.
</P>
<P>
   The book is published by Allyn &AMP; Bacon, and president Bill Barke
recently told Publisher's Weekly that it had been selling about
230,000 copies every year but that the new edition is expected to
double that amount.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Elements of Style'' accounts for nearly 2 percent of the
company's annual revenue.
</P>
<P>
   All this explains why houses such as Little, Brown are combing
through their rights list to see what might be profitably reissued.
Little, Brown has recently issued new editions of Lillian Hellman's
memoirs and the C.S. Forester ``Hornblower'' novels.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Palliser's `Unburied' a rewarding tale of betrayal
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Charles Palliser's bewitching ``The
Unburied'' begins just after World War I. A man journeys to Geneva
to confront an elderly woman about a recently published book. The
book is a mixture of correct information and incorrect suppositions
about a famous series of medieval murders in the English town of
Thurchester.
</P>
<P>
   The narrator knows the book's suppositions are false because he
has recently come into possession of the Courtine manuscript, which
lays bare the truth of the murders that were echoed nearly 400
years later in a sad story of human duplicity and the persistence
of evil.
</P>
<P>
   The old woman is soon to die and knows it, but gives away
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   We flash back 50 years to the story of the studious,
determinedly unworldly academic Dr. Courtine, as he arrives in
Thurchester to visit Austin, an old college chum from whom he has
been estranged for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   While in Thurchester, where the murders took place in the
cathedral, death strikes yet again, in the apparently
incomprehensible fashion beloved of those with a taste for
locked-room mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   The new murders aren't that difficult to unravel _ any mystery
aficionado knows to prepare himself for a variation of the old
shell game when a corpse has to be identified by his clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, ``The Unburied'' remains a delight because of an
intricacy that never becomes confusing, and for the perfect ear
Palliser has for Victorian life and its ornate, attractive speech
rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   In inexpert hands, this can be a bit like an oatmeal bath, but
unlike many of the writers Palliser is channeling, he keeps the
plot moving and the atmosphere atmospheric:
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat in the vast, gloomy dining room in which there were no
other diners, served by a lugubrious waiter with the mournful
solemnity of the last priest of a dying church. The ambience seemed
all of a piece with this ancient, decaying town withs its unlit and
dilapidated streets in which nobody ever seemed to be about.''
</P>
<P>
   He's after a tricky melding here. There are all sorts of hints
of other writers, from the unavoidable echoes of Trollope, provided
by the author's surname, to the Jamesian tenor of the prologue, to
the retrieval of a great, buried Victorian story that is the
novel's centerpiece, which recalls A.S. Byatt's ``Possession.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the shifting time frames _ present day, i.,e.
1919, while the Courtine manuscript, which occupies the bulk of the
book, involves the deep Victorian era as well as solving the
original medieval murders.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the plot, the novel is about the getting of wisdom, for
the initially unsympathetic and blundering Courtine has his own
fears and demons that the narrative helps him solve.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who invite betrayal,'' a character tells
Courtine in a highly charged, brief encounter towards the book's
end. ``They are demanding towards themselves and don't realize how
hard they are on other people. They make it difficult for others
not to fail them. And in some cases they take a grim pleasure from
being let down.''
</P>
<P>
   The novel is less about its title _ although one aged corpse
does turn up in Thurchester Cathedral _ than it is about the
various permutations of betrayal, and how different people react to
it.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, ``The Unburied'' explains all of the mysteries of
Thurchester, as well as some of the more complex aspects of human
nature. It's a delicious book, a perfect companion for the
proverbial dark and stormy night.

 &HT;    Cruising with this Cape Cod kayak corps a clarion call to
courage
 &HT;    By Mary Ellen Flannery
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLEANS, Mass. _ My brother, who is usually so protective,
insists we will be fine. No matter what the kid renting kayaks says
to us: Small-craft advisory, storms coming, lots of experience
necessary. Just wear a life jacket, Johnny says.
</P>
<P>
   My brother, brother-in-law, boyfriend and I are setting sail _
er paddle _ on a 10-mile kayaking adventure in Cape Cod. For weeks,
I've been lifting 5-pound hand weights at my desk.
</P>
<P>
   My brother, Johnny, and my brother-in-law, Seth, have their own
super long (and consequently super fast) kayaks. But my boyfriend,
Greg, and I rent from the kid at Goose Hummock, an outdoor shop
that sells fishing tackle, canoes and woolly jackets.
</P>
<P>
   The kid looks worried. Do we have a lot of experience, he asks?
I say no. (I had been kayaking twice before. Once in Sanibel four
years ago, I fell asleep on the plastic boat and drifted ashore at
a French resort, which made me think I'd bobbed very far indeed.)
Johnny says yes. I say, well, no. Johnny says yes.
</P>
<P>
   I do not know when my little brother became so adventurous. As I
recall, he refused to get his driver license until he turned 18,
for caution's sake. But I am the self-appointed trek leader, so I
sign the death release and pray that we don't end up eating each
other later. We walk down to the dock, which stretches into the
southern bend of Town Cove, beneath a gray-shingled windmill where
families sometimes picnic.
</P>
<P>
   But not today, because the sky is black.
</P>
<P>
   Kayaking isn't hard. I suspect sitting so close to the water
might make some people nervous and of course, it's a lot tippier
than a canoe. But if you curve your legs inside along the sides,
it's not so hard to maintain your balance. These particular kayaks
had rudders, which means we could steer with our feet. Our original
plans had been to kayak along the inside of Cape Cod's arm from
Eastham to Provincetown, about 22 miles. A little too far, even
after months of hand weights. Instead we decided to kayak in the
arm, through its veins, I guess, from Town Cove to where the ocean
has broken through the barrier beach and the salt water has invaded
the marsh.
</P>
<P>
   What's nice about traveling inside the cove is that we can see
into people's back yards where they're moseying around, setting up
fishing poles, wrestling with dogs, and in one case celebrating a
wedding. We are flying by them, on the outgoing tide to the sea,
because Seth and Johnny have scouted out where the fastest currents
are running.
</P>
<P>
   I say the water is acting crazy, smacking over the top of the
kayak and soaking my shorts, and they laugh at me.
</P>
<P>
   We have plenty of water (that was Seth) and plenty of roast beef
sandwiches (thanks to the trek leader who didn't really want to eat
her brother). But can I stop to drink any water? No, because the
mean boys are leaving me behind. Argh. It takes an hour or so to
get through the cove, heading north past Hopkin's Island, a bird
sanctuary, into the mouth of Nauset Marsh.
</P>
<P>
   On our left is Fort Hill, where local soldiers set up guns
during the War of 1812; now it's a popular spot for vacation
photos. Ahead we can see Eastham's Coast Guard Station, where the
ocean ate a parking lot in the blizzard of 1978. But we turn east,
around Snow Point, toward the break in the beach.
</P>
<P>
   We are skirting small sedge islands, called hummocks, past
lobster buoys and clam beds, sometimes in just a few inches of
water. On a nice day, this would be absolutely beautiful. The water
would be quiet, and I would be looking at the marsh birds: tiny
piping plovers and massive ospreys rising above the marsh grass.
But right now, even though the boys claim it's just spray, I think
it's raining. I know it's getting rougher. Waves are breaking over
the nose of my kayak.
</P>
<P>
   And still, all I know about kayaking so far is this: Turn and
face the waves, or tip over. So I am turning and turning, using
those handy rudders over and over again. And I think I'm getting
the hang of it. I can shift my hips without fear.
</P>
<P>
   I experiment with different paddle strokes. Deep. Shallow. I
pretend I am a kayak professional on TV. I pretend I am rounding
Cape May. No, I pretend I am rounding Cape Horn. I have a blister
on my thumb that I mention to Greg. He says, ``that's not going to
stop the trek leader, is it?'' I wonder if I'm being patronized.
</P>
<P>
   High tide is maybe minutes away and the water is rushing out of
the marsh, through the break in the beach, like kids running crazy
from a beehive. We must cross this noisy (and very scary) water,
and I am wondering why. Johnny and Seth tell me lunch is on the
other side. Now I know I'm being patronized, but I don't care. I am
actually talking to myself, saying things like: Mary Ellen, it is
very unlikely you're going to die.

 &HT;    Denmark promises family fun
 &HT;    By Shelley Emling
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COPENHAGEN, Denmark _ While flying here with our children, ages
4 and 18 months, my husband and I made a depressing discovery:
Tivoli, the city's best-loved attraction, was closed for the
winter.
</P>
<P>
   According to the guidebook, which _ I admit _ we should have
reviewed earlier, the famous amusement park is open only from April
to September.
</P>
<P>
   It was early November.
</P>
<P>
   Unsure of how we were going to spend the next three days, we
entered the tourist office to find a hotel room. A man directed us
to the Hotel Ansgar, a clean, pleasant hotel just a five-minute
walk from the center of town. We got a room, which included a big
breakfast of cereal, cold cuts, and pastries, for about $80 a
night.
</P>
<P>
   We began to feel better. Our new goal was to discover _ and
enjoy with children _ a Copenhagen minus its best-known asset.
</P>
<P>
   And this was easy to do. In fact, there was so much to do, it
wasn't long before our itinerary was packed tighter than our
suitcases.
</P>
<P>
   What we liked best is that Copenhagen is truly a city for
walkers, so there's no need to shell out a fortune in cab fares.
Less than a mile square, the city's core consists of five
pedestrian strands, known as Stroget, and the surrounding tangle of
roads and courtyards. Many of the streets in the oldest part of
town are cobbled and winding, bordered by pleasant cafes and shops.
</P>
<P>
   Starting at Radhuspladsen, Copenhagen's central square, these
pedestrian streets meander east. The square is dominated by the
Radhuset (Town Hall), which includes a 350-foot tower that offers
panoramic views right across to Sweden. Also, the Town Hall is home
to the World Clock, which gives such details as the position of the
planets and times around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In front of Radhuset is the statue of Denmark's best-known
writer, Hans Christian Andersen, who was actually not a
Copenhagener at all, but a native of the island of Fyn.
</P>
<P>
   Within easy strolling distance of the square are the cathedral,
Parliament, the old Stock Exchange, and the domes and spires of
various other civic buildings. Each contributes weight to a skyline
that's gloriously free of skyscrapers.
</P>
<P>
   We spent hours wandering the streets, marveling at how every
Dane appears to be rich, healthy, blond and incredibly good
looking.
</P>
<P>
   According to author Bill Bryson, Copenhagen is the only city in
which gorgeous office girls come out at lunchtime to sunbathe
topless in the city parks. Unfortunately for my husband, it was too
cold for this sort of display during our visit.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the city's atmosphere is startlingly relaxed, which
is something when you consider that the city was twice bombarded by
the British under Admiral Lord Nelson in the 1800s, and that it was
twice devastated the century before by fires blazing through the
wooden houses.
</P>
<P>
   It is also incredibly civil.
</P>
<P>
   Sustaining a seamless monarchy and moderate politics for a
millennium, Denmark has remained modest and peace-loving. There is
little to suggest that it is the capital of a country that once
ruled Scandinavia. And this, I think, is delightful.
</P>
<P>
   Other examples of Denmark's civility:
</P>
<P>
   This country of five million citizens boasts six conservatories,
seven symphony orchestras and 230 primary music schools.
</P>
<P>
   There are so many museums it's impossible to count, each with
admirable collections of art and sculpture for all tastes.
</P>
<P>
   One of our favorites was the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, an
elaborate building with a vast collection of Egyptian sculpture,
Greek and Roman statuary, as well as works by Degas, Gaugin and
other Impressionists. Glyptotek was given to the city by Carl
Jacobsen, the son of the founder of the Carlsberg Breweries. Its
nucleus is a lush indoor garden, from which you can explore the
nooks and chambers that house what is considered to be the best
collection of Etruscan art outside Italy and Europe's finest
collection of Roman portraits.
</P>
<P>
   A little farther afield is the Frederiksborg Castle, which lies
in the middle of Hillerod, about a 40-minute drive north from
Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest parts of the buildings that make up the castle date
from 1560 and were built by Federik II. The castle was used by the
kings of Denmark for more than 200 years. To say the structure,
with its copper-clad roofs and spires, is impressive would be an
understatement. Most importantly, the Museum of National History is
housed here, and it contains all sorts of historical portraits and
paintings. We made a game of this visit by encouraging our
4-year-old to pick out the portrait of the ugliest _ and most
attractive _ king and queen.
</P>
<P>
   Best for the children, though, is the Louisiana Museum of Modern
Art at Humlebaek, just outside Copenhagen. The museum displays a
vast array of art and sculpture, from around 1945 to the present
day, with works by Giacometti, Moore, Calder and others. But the
best part is the three-story children's area, where budding artists
can paint, sculpt, or just play with Legos to their heart's
content.
</P>
<P>
   If you can shake the children, you may want to check out the
Museum Erotica at Kobmagergade 24, where you can view a wide range
of erotic films, magazines, paintings, postcards, and sex toys.
According to the brochure, you can even study the sex life of Hans
Christian Andersen, although its unclear why you should want to do
such a thing.
</P>
<P>
   We also visited the carefully tended gardens surrounding
Rosenborg Slot, the Dutch Renaissance castle built by Christian IV.
Intending it first as a summer residence, the king loved the castle
so much that he ended up living, and dying, there. Today it's a
museum (yes, another museum) where the crown jewels, as well as a
collection of costumes and royal memorabilia, are housed. But the
surrounding park is the real showstopper. When we visited, the
trees' leaves were every shade of red, orange and yellow.
</P>
<P>
   Although there wasn't a slide or swing to be found in the
playground, there was an abundance of ropes to swing on and a maze
of tree logs to climb on. The kids loved it.
</P>
<P>
   The Danes employ a laissez-faire attitude toward their children
in that they rarely keep a close eye on them the way we do in the
states. (Remember the Danish tourist arrested in 1997 for leaving
her baby daughter in a stroller outside a New York restaurant?) And
there is a reason for this.
</P>
<P>
   Denmark is an almost absurdly safe country where the most
malicious crime seems to be bike theft.
</P>
<P>
   This is just another reason why I loved Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at the end of our trip, we were sad to have missed
Tivoli, which would have offered spectacular rides, fireworks
displays, pantomime theaters, and jazz and rock concerts. The
attraction was built in the 1840s by Danish architect George
Carstensen, who persuaded a worried King Christian VIII that a huge
amusement park would distract people from politics.
</P>
<P>
   But we'd be back. One final reminder of why this country is so
splendid came at the airport when we were waiting for our plane to
depart: a play area for children, the centerpiece of which was a
giant pirate ship surrounded by colorful plastic balls. What a
place!
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   Other things to see and do with children:
</P>
<P>
   Darnarks Akvarium (Charlottenlund). The array of fish will
tantalize every age group. Daily from 10 to 6.
</P>
<P>
   Eksperimentarium (6 miles north of Copenhagen in the beachside
town of Hellerup). More than 200 exhibitions are clustered in 15
Discovery Islands, each exploring a different facet of science,
technology, and natural phenomena with hands- and body-on exhibits.
Mon., Wed., and Fri. 9-6; Tues. and Thurs. 9-9; weekends 11-6.
</P>
<P>
   Legoland in south-central Jylland. It's filled with scaled-down
versions of cities and villages, a Statue of Liberty and Mount
Rushmore, all constructed from 35 million plastic Lego bricks.
Daily 10-8 from April to September.

`BREATHLESS' TURNS 40, ITS YOUTHFUL IMPUDENCE INTACT  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 16)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 Phillip Lopate's most recent book is ``Totally Tenderly
Tragically,'' a collection of film essays.  
 By PHILLIP LOPATE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An amiably cocky Frenchman in sunglasses steals a car, mugs
people for petty cash to romance a cute American student and tries
to collect money from shady characters so he can run away with her
to Rome, but she seems more interested in flirting with contacts to
secure a writing job, besides which she is pregnant by the
Frenchman and he seems indifferent to this fact, while a police
manhunt closes in on them both. No wonder they called it
``Breathless''!
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the original title, ``A Bout de Souffle,'' might be
better translated as ``Out of Breath,'' with more somber
connotations. Forty years after it shook up the movie world,
Jean-Luc Godard's brilliant provocation is being revived at the
Film Forum for one week, April 7-13, in a new print.
</P>
<P>
   For his debut feature, Godard, now 69, wanted to make a film
where ``anything goes,'' and there is still a strong scent of the
anarchic and dangerous in his concoction. Susan Sontag once
compared Godard's impact on his medium with Schoenberg's
introduction of atonal music and the Cubists' challenge to
traditional painting.
</P>
<P>
   Having been a young, impressionable film buff when
``Breathless'' first appeared, I can't help but experience
nostalgic exhilaration at the memory of its freshness. Granted,
``Breathless'' had plenty of company: in the early '60s, such
masterworks as ``L'Avventura,'' ``La Dolce Vita,'' ``Psycho'' and
the Apu trilogy were thrilling audiences worldwide, while Godard's
confreres in the Cahiers du Cinema circle, the
critics-turned-filmmakers of the French New Wave Francois Truffaut,
Claude Chabrol, Eric Rohmer, Jacques Rivette and Louis Malle, were
astonishing us with everything from ``The 400 Blows'' to ``Zazie
dans le Metro.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet only ``Breathless'' seemed a revolutionary break with the
cinema that had gone before. It seemed a new kind of storytelling,
with its saucy jump cuts, digressions, quotes, in jokes and
addresses to the viewer. And yet, underneath all these brash
interventions was a Mozartean melancholy that strongly suggested
classical measure. ``Classical-modern'' was the way Godard phrased
it in a later film, ``Bande a Part''; that Godardian paradox was
already operative in ``Breathless.''
</P>
<P>
   What seemed miraculous when the film first opened remains its
greatest coup: Godard's ability to infuse an improvisatory manner
with an underlying mood of grave inevitability. The spontaneity
came from the way he worked: using a five-page outline by Truffaut,
rather than a finished script; writing the day's dialogue at the
last moment and speaking it to the actors just before they had to
deliver their lines (they were shot silent and dubbed in later);
and employing a handheld camera and a wheelchair to save the time
of laying tracks for dolly shots. But the gravity came from
somewhere deep inside Godard, a defeatist quality symbolized by
those fatalistic overhead shots he thought he was borrowing from
Fritz Lang.
</P>
<P>
   Godard remains the darling of film studies, if only for the way
his self-reflective movies highlight issues of cinematic
fabrication. But will 17-year-olds still respond to ``Breathless''
as revolutionary? I think they might, because, however much its
technical innovations have been assimilated, it still speaks to
youth through its rebellious impudence. In a curious way, it could
even be seen as the progenitor of the youth-cult film.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't like the sea, and don't care for the mountains,
and don't like the big city either,'' the film's protagonist,
Michel (Jean-Paul Belmondo), jibes at the camera _ and us _ while
driving, ``then go hang yourself.'' So he rattles on with his views
of France, hitchhiking, women drivers; a few moments later, he has
shot a traffic policeman to death. (This combination of yakking and
violence would later lead a Godard-smitten Quentin Tarantino to
attempt the same in ``Pulp Fiction.'')
</P>
<P>
   Whether meant as a Gidean ``gratuitous act'' or a means of
survival, the shooting certainly complicates our attitude toward
Michel. Is he a sociopath or just a likable, none-too-bright guy in
a jam? Perhaps both: he makes himself up as he goes along.
Michel/Belmondo is forever adjusting his performance, doing faces
in the mirror, practicing lines, imitating his hero, Humphrey
Bogart, and aspiring to the tough-guy niche he insecurely occupies.
</P>
<P>
   Life is a bluff, we are none of us authentic, the film seems to
say _ just as Godard is bluffing at genre, pretending to make an
ordinary gangster B-movie. Meanwhile, death awaits. ``We are dead
men on leave,'' the film quotes Lenin. The existential pessimism
and philosophy of self-invention in ``Breathless'' fit right into
the mood of young people exiting with relief the conformist '50s.
Godard also struck an anti-authoritarian note by mocking the police
(who are portrayed like bumbling Keystone Kops, in what looks like
a cheap shot today).
</P>
<P>
   The filmmaker, who was from a family of Swiss-Protestant
physicians and bankers, came to anti-bourgeois sentiments early. As
David Sterritt perceptively observes in his recent book, ``The
Films of Jean-Luc Godard,'' ``Michel's character _ including its
more menacing side _ draws some of its dark power from the
filmmaker's own brushes with this territory.
</P>
<P>
   Godard as late as 1952 was known as a chronic thief (relatives
and the Cahiers office were among his targets), a failed homosexual
prostitute, and enough of a social misfit to be committed by his
father to a psychiatric hospital for what one biographical sketch
describes as `a considerable period.''' These antisocial impulses
did not constitute the whole story, however: Godard was also an
ethnology student, a sober, thoughtful film critic and an artist of
severe integrity.
</P>
<P>
   The oddity is that this particular director, who in his later
career so ignored the public's appetite for pleasure, should have
struck such a popular chord with his first feature. (He is
currently embarked on a multipart essay film, ``Histoire(s) du
Cinema.'')
</P>
<P>
   Much of the appeal of ``Breathless'' derives from its inspired
pairing of Belmondo (a bit player before this role launched him as
an international star) with Jean Seberg, as his American
girlfriend, Patricia. The complexity of their psychological duet
goes a long way toward restoring the sense of realism that Godard's
alienation tactics strip away elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Belmondo, with his boxer's physique, is animalistic energy,
impulsive in crime, masochistic in love; Seberg, with her short,
boyish hairdo and striped polo, seems more cultivated and
self-aware. In a sense, their relationship is a reversal of the
Henry James pattern: this time the Frenchman is the Romantic naif
and the American woman the cool, worldly skeptic. She defines
herself by ambivalent Cartesian epigrams: ``I don't know if I am
unhappy because I am not free, or if I am not free because I am
unhappy.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Godard was obviously charmed by Seberg's gamine air of
mysterious reserve, and he shot her profile in closeup as if she
were a silent film star _ Louise Brooks, say. She had been
discovered by Otto Preminger, who launched her in ``Saint Joan''
(1957) and ``Bonjour Tristesse'' (1958); Godard, that most filial,
ancestor-worshiping of iconoclasts, cast her in what he viewed as a
continuation of her part in ``Bonjour Tristesse.''
</P>
<P>
   Most critics have assumed that Belmondo was Godard's
autobiographical stand-in, but there is at least as much of him in
the analytical outsider, Patricia, as in the panther-like Michel.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Godard said that he found the theme of
``Breathless'' during the shooting when he ``became interested in
Belmondo. I saw him as a sort of block to be filmed to discover
what lay inside.'' When Patricia says to Michel, ``I've been
staring at you for the past 10 minutes and I can't see anything but
a mask,'' her words may as well be Godard's.
</P>
<P>
   Their long scene indoors, when Michel keeps coaxing Patricia to
make love, is famous for its jump cuts, which disdain traditional
film continuity. The conversation jumps all over the map, from
fornication to Faulkner, from Renoir to remorse, and when the
long-awaited sex scene finally arrives, Godard tweaks our prurience
by filming it as indistinguishable shapes under bed sheets. What to
show, what to leave out, which dialogue to render audible, which to
drown out with car horns _ all this is part of the cat-and-mouse
game the filmmaker plays with us, to our off-balance enjoyment.
</P>
<P>
   The story goes that Godard, faced with an overlong three-hour
film, decided that instead of losing the subplots (as his mentor,
the director Jean-Pierre Melville, advised), he would cut within
the sequences. The jump-cutting gives the film a jittery rhythm
that paradoxically plunges us into a prolonged sense of dawdling,
since we can no longer judge real time.
</P>
<P>
   The effect is that of hanging out with these characters, rather
than being pushed through a plot with them. ``Hanging'' is
something young people particularly understand; indeed, the attempt
of Godard's imitators to capture the mystique of that (non)activity
onscreen may be one of the film's most enduring legacies, for
better or worse.
</P>
<P>
   Godard discovered in filming ``Breathless'' that storytelling
was not his strong suit, so he compensated by emphasizing lyricism
over narrative. This preference, too, seems now to be part of the
international-youth aesthetic, as seen in rock videos, for
instance. Lyrical rushes break out in ``Breathless'' in many
directions: Seberg's sunniness as she twirls in a new frock, the
joy of motion celebrated in long walking or driving sequences, the
quoted allure of poetry and Hollywood movies, and, always, Paris.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the film moves outside, Paris swirls around and
threatens to seduce the camera away. Godard, who broke into
filmmaking with nonfiction shorts, said that ``fiction is
interesting only if it is validated by a documentary context''; and
certainly there is half-buried in ``Breathless'' a jaunty
documentary about Parisian streets, bistros, travel agencies,
monuments.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that documentary look comes from the use of newsreel
stock; some from the deadpan style of Godard's great cameraman,
Raoul Coutard. What stands out 40 years later is how elegant the
city looks. Godard makes no attempt to startle us with grunge;
surprisingly, this is tourist Paris: the Arc de Triomphe, the
Champs-Elysees.
</P>
<P>
   Michel points out with pride how beautiful the Place de la
Concorde looks, lighted at night. The cunning score, by Martial
Solal, with its cool, xylophone jazz or lush violin passages,
suggests some big-budget studio comedy such as ``Paris When It
Sizzles'' and counterpoints with ironic premonition the grubby end
of a petty thug.
</P>
<P>
   Godard took the atmospheric fatalism of the French gangster
movie _ the poetic realism of Marcel Carne and Jacques Feyder, down
through Jacques Becker's ``Touchez pas au Grisbi,'' where Jean
Gabin in pajamas drinks a glass of milk before going to bed _ and
hot-spliced it with the plot-driven fatalism of American film noir
(Bogart, Lang, the double-crossing dame).
</P>
<P>
   ``Breathless'' still plays beautifully, like a charming ode to
Franco-American relations. (Godard had not yet hardened into
doctrinaire anti-Americanism; there is a fluidity in his feelings
about the United States, both pro and con.) What dates is the
film's lack of resistance to sexist notions such as the betraying
female, and its willingness to discuss women in terms of their body
parts.
</P>
<P>
   Another weakness of ``Breathless'' is simply that it is a young
man's film: full of spectacular effects and vitality, but without
quite the consequential depth that would mark Godard's later
efforts, such as ``Vivre Sa Vie'' or ``Contempt.'' It runs on nerve
until it stops, out of breath. ``A shallow masterpiece,'' we might
conclude, as Pauline Kael did (with less justification) about
``Citizen Kane.''
</P>
<P>
   Its beguiling lightness seems both its strength and limit.
Still, that brio captivated and influenced directors everywhere: in
America, Robert Altman, Martin Scorsese, Hal Hartley; in Japan,
Nagisa Oshima, Shohei Imamura; in Brazil, Glauber Rocha; in
Yugoslavia, Dusan Makavejev; in Germany, Wim Wenders; in Iran,
Abbas Kiarostami, and in Hong Kong, Wong Kar-Wai _ to name just a
few.
</P>
<P>
   ``Breathless'' lighted the fuse for the whole youth movement in
cinema. If some of today's younger directors may not even know how
indebted they are to this work, and if Godard himself has become
something of a curmudgeon, unappreciative of the latest cinematic
fads, the fact remains that ``Breathless'' is where it _ they _ all
began.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Howling arctic winds will numb New England on Friday. In the
wake of Thursday's modest snowstorm that affected only parts of the
region, arctic air will pour south from Canada, keeping daytime
temperatures in the single digits and teens. More importantly,
winds from the northwest will average 20 to 30 mph across eastern
New England, increasing the cooling power of the wind to
potentially dangerous levels. Temperatures Friday night will fall
toward minus 20 degrees in parts of northwest New England. Farther
west, bands of lake-effect snow will develop Friday down wind of
Lake Ontario in western New York.
</P>
<P>
   Rough seas, patches of arctic sea smoke and bands of
ocean-effect snow will prevail over waters off the New England
coast as strong arctic winds are moistened over Atlantic waters.
Meanwhile, along the coast of northern Florida, ocean winds will
gust over 30 mph in response to the large pressure difference
between a strong, sprawling high centered over Tennessee and a
trough of low pressure south of Florida. With dry air associated
with the high gaining a foothold on Florida, the stage will be set
for a chilly night Friday night, with a freeze across the northern
part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the big chill in the Northeast, the west-central
Plains will turn milder as winds from the southwest spread across
Kansas, Nebraska and southwest South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   In the Far West, areas of rain and mountain snows will prevail
in the Pacific Northwest, where winds off the Pacific continue to
deliver moisture. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Snow at Last &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Snowflakes finally flew over Boston on Thursday, ending the
record wait for snow. It was a modest snow, with accumulations
through early Thursday afternoon generally less than 5 inches in
eastern Massachusetts. Besides bringing Boston's first snow this
winter, the salient effects of the culprit low pressure system was
to draw arctic air into the Northeast as it moved out to sea. With
the arctic front now lying south of New England, there will be more
occasions for snow. Even though the arctic chill will ease this
weekend, an opportunity for heavy snow in Boston may come Tuesday.

   NEW YORK _ One goal of the Altogether Different festival is to
offer new chances for audience development and expansion to small
or little-known dance troupes. Variety is another goal, hence the
title. But 33 Fainting Spells, which opened the three-week festival
at the Joyce Theater on Tuesday night, is altogether different with
a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorrow's Sister,'' the hourlong piece presented by this
Seattle-based troupe, is a good example of the company's unusual
approach. Dayna Hanson and Gaelen Hanson, who founded this
three-woman group, tell stories, create atmosphere and evoke
emotion through small gestures and moves that in themselves are
about as abstract as movement can get. There are also long passages
when nothing seems to be happening. A woman sits in a chair. Three
women stand in a row looking out at the audience. A woman laughs.
Another stares out a window, her back to the audience.
</P>
<P>
   The masterly organization of detail does make for a quick
suspension of disbelief for viewers willing to concentrate hard.
One enters the Hansons' world almost unknowingly, in this case
emerging unprepared for the emotional wallop packed by the closing
moments of ``Sorrow's Sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   The set, lighting and atmosphere suggest a cramped hideaway
pressed in upon by the weight of onrushing disastrous history. Anne
Frank's attic comes to mind. It is inhabited by three women (the
Hansons and Peggy Piacenza) wearing drab black dresses and sturdy
shoes. Suitcases strewn about the floor suggest that they are about
to leave.
</P>
<P>
   A gift of a single metal roller skate is received with blank
bewilderment at a ragbag birthday celebration near the start of
``Sorrow's Sister.'' Disappointing a present though it may be, the
skate is a bit of elegant detritus that gives one of the women a
mobility that is suggestive, choreographically and metaphorically.
</P>
<P>
   Another major event occurs when one of the women stumbles into
the room, bruised and bleeding. She falls sick, curled limply on a
mattress that releases small streams of dust when her fingers
scrabble against it. Her small jolting steps toward recovery and
the others' reactions help to create the sense of a tiny universe
far more potent _ and perhaps even more dangerous _ than the world
beyond the window.
</P>
<P>
   The lighting, by Hallie Kuperman and Lara Wilder, plays an
important part in establishing that universe. ``Sorrow's Sister''
is performed to a carefully knit suite of music and words by Kurt
Weill, Kate Vannah, Paganini, Shostakovich, Dylan Thomas, Dvorak
and Bartok. Like the production, the score represents an impressive
feat of intellectual and emotional weaving of ingredients into a
seamless whole. With ``Sorrow's Sister,'' problematical though it
sometimes is, the troupe aims high but invites the audience along
for the flight.
</P>
<P>
   The piece will be repeated Friday night at the Joyce (175 Eighth
Ave., at 19th Street). Other festival participants are the
companies of Lula Washington, Neil Greenberg, Yoshiko Chuma, Sara
Pearson and Patrik Widrig, Pascal Rioult and Lawrence Goldhuber and
Heidi Latsky.

&HT;     RAMS SHOULD BE WARY OF VIKINGS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're the St. Louis Rams right now, you should be a little
worried.
</P>
<P>
   Life has been too easy lately. The wins have come too smoothly.
Their world is similar to that gentle breeze that swirls in the air
just moments before Mother Nature starts unleashing her haymakers.
</P>
<P>
   Something ugly is about to hit St. Louis, something more
commonly known as the Minnesota Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   The best game of the postseason will kick off in the TransWorld
Dome in St. Louis on Sunday. It features the Rams, the best team in
the NFC throughout the regular season, and the Vikings, the best
team in the NFC right now. And if the Rams aren't careful, their
head coach, Dick Vermeil, will have a new reason to shed a few
tears _ his team will be the most disappointed 13-3 bunch in the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings, for those who haven't noticed, are the most likely
spoilers in this year's postseason plans. They looked that good
even before dispatching the Dallas Cowboys in last weekend's NFC
wild-card matchup. They are hot enough to turn the Rams'
screenplay-type season into something that belongs in ``Scream 3''
and talented enough to take Washington or Tampa Bay in a one-game
shootout. Minnesota hasn't won nine of its last 11 games off sheer
luck.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a defense that some 49ers could start for, the Vikings
can be scary, especially with the way Jeff George has been throwing
the football. You remember him in Oakland. When the Raiders dumped
him last year, he practically had to beg for a job. 49ers general
manager Bill Walsh wouldn't even give him a sniff. The man was
poison, his critics said, and his track record couldn't overturn
that judgment.
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota, George is something else: one more player with a
suspect character who is bent on proving to the world that given
the right opportunity, he can be a winner, too. Last year, Vikings
wide receiver Randy Moss had it in for his critics. It's George's
turn this season and when you combine the way Moss runs and George
uncorks a football, you produce an image few cornerbacks are
prepared for and even fewer want to face.
</P>
<P>
   But Minnesota isn't just George and Moss and fellow Pro Bowl
wide receiver Cris Carter. There appears to be an attitude around
the Vikings that of all the teams left in the NFC Super Bowl hunt,
they have the edge because they know this terrain better than
anyone else. This is Minnesota's seventh trip to the playoffs in
eight seasons under coach Denny Green.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis hasn't made a playoff appearance since 1989, and the
Redskins haven't accomplished the feat in eight years. As for Tampa
Bay, this is only its second postseason showing in the last 18
years.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings are relying on their opponents flinching when faced
with the pressure of football in January. Minnesota's players also
have personal experience to fall back on. Faced with their own
coronation last season, they learned how easy it is to be favored
for a championship and how difficult it is to win one.
</P>
<P>
   There the Vikings were late last January, sprawled across the
turf at their Metrodome home, wondering why they deserved such a
fate. The Atlanta Falcons had done them in with a field goal from
Morten Andersen in the NFC Championship Game. Suddenly, a team that
won 15 regular-season games and scored more points than anyone else
in NFL history was on suicide watch. A year has passed since that
upset and still the Vikings feel a need to atone for last year's
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   After all, they wouldn't be the first team in recent memory to
be both dominant and deflated in one season and then resurgent the
next. The Denver Broncos did it only a few years ago. They went
from being stunned by the upstart Jacksonville Jaguars in the 1996
playoffs to earning a wild-card spot the following year and running
all the way to their first Super Bowl title.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings are strong enough to do just that. Or should we say
the NFL, and more specifically, the NFC, is weak enough for
Minnesota to make a compelling playoff run. They have an effective
running game once again, with Robert Smith finally healthy. Their
defensive problems are mostly in the secondary, where they actually
start a converted wide receiver at one cornerback. And their
overall offensive talent is sufficient enough to get them 25-30
points when it has to.
</P>
<P>
   In today's NFL, that's enough to advance in the playoffs, but
the Vikings have something else. They think they can beat anybody
they meet in the next couple of weeks. If you're the St. Louis
Rams, you shouldn't take that attitude lightly.

 ALBUM OF THE WEEK: SONIC YOUTH'S `GOODBYE 20th CENTURY'  
(EDS: In `PLUS MINUS', replace the words with the typographical
symbols) 
(bl) 
 By JON PARELES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   SONIC YOUTH: ``Goodbye 20th Century'' (SYR).
</P>
<P>
   To send off the 1900s, Sonic Youth acknowledges its roots in a
distinctly 20th-century phenomenon: experimental composers who
embraced improvisation, noise, repetition and the workings of
chance.
</P>
<P>
   The band and friends, including the composers Christian Wolff
and Takehisa Kosugi, perform 10 composers' works in which music is
less an arrangement of sounds than a collision of them or a
meditation on their coexistence. There are wordless witticisms:
George Maciunas' ``Piano Piece No. 13'' _ nailing down the keys of
a piano, as shown on a CD-ROM video that is included _ and Yoko
Ono's ``Vocal Piece for Soprano,'' 12 seconds of a child's screams.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Reich's ``Pendulum Music'' is pure process: the chirping,
calliopelike feedback of a microphone swinging over a speaker.
Kosugi's ``PLUS MINUS'' and John Cage's ``Six'' and ``Four6 '' '
are sequences of textures, realized with Sonic Youth's guitar
vocabulary of shimmers, slides, screeches and distortion blotches;
Wolff's ``Edges'' and ``Burdocks'' place splintered sounds around
fragments of narrative or melody. Pauline Oliveros' ``Six for New
Time,'' written for Sonic Youth, unfolds from consonance to
cacophony.
</P>
<P>
   But the piece that sounds tailored to the band is James Tenney's
``Having Never Written a Note for Percussion,'' an oceanic crest
and ebb of dissonant guitar chords. It was composed in 1971,
anticipating Sonic Youth by a decade.

`THE SOPRANOS':   THE ZITI'S IN THE OVEN AND THE MATRIARCH'S STILL
NOT DEAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Broadcast notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(dal)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``She's dead to me,'' Tony Soprano says about his mother,
spitting out the word ``dead'' as if it were a bullet. He says this
not once but twice in the opening episode of the new season of
``The Sopranos.'' Each time is a reminder of how magically James
Gandolfini embodies this likable, despicable character, and why he
is the greatest of the series' many wicked delights.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Livia, who set up her son to be killed, is not dead
to anyone else. We learn that near the start of the newest episode
(Sunday night at 9 on HBO), as the story is brought up to date in
an extended sequence that is operatic in its reach, with music,
drama, vibrant costumes and outsized emotions converging. If the
music that drives this scene is not exactly Verdi, it is something
more appropriate. Frank Sinatra langorously sings ``It Was a Very
Good Year'' as the characters are captured in silent motion:
</P>
<P>
   Livia is in her hospital bed, having survived the stroke that
left her gasping at the end of last season. Tony is teaching his
daughter to drive when he isn't at his job, being handed a shopping
bag full of cash. His wife, Carmela, is taking baked ziti out of
the oven with the kind of knowing but bored grimace that Edie Falco
has used so brilliantly to define the character. And Uncle Junior,
in an orange jumpsuit, walks down a prison corridor, having
insisted to the FBI that he, not his nephew Tony, is head of the
crime family. Graceful, witty and brazen, that sequence and the
entire first episode are everything fans of ``The Sopranos'' could
hope for.
</P>
<P>
   The sequence is nothing like a recap, though. Viewers who know
the series are likely to yell ``Uncle June!'' in recognition, while
anyone else might be lost. But then we have never heard ``Last week
on `The Sopranos' ...'' That is a small indication of how
thoroughly the series has broken the television mold.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of recaps, deft conversations set up characters and
attitudes. Here, Junior's temporary replacement explains that Tony
was about to smother his mother with a pillow, but her stroke got
there first. And, he continues, Tony was seeing a psychiatrist,
matricide and therapy being given equal weight. That is why Tony's
shrink, Jennifer Melfi, is now receiving patients in a seamy motel
off a New Jersey highway, hiding out from people who assume Tony
spilled family secrets while searching for an emotional
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   The only series in years to become a critical hit and a pop-cult
phenomenon, ``The Sopranos'' has established its own family loyalty
and in-joke recognition among viewers. David Chase, its creator,
shrewdly builds on that in the new episodes. We see that Tony's
crew has continued to update its business dealings, running a stock
brokerage with a surprisingly high rate of office violence.
</P>
<P>
   Tony's older sister, Janice, returns from Seattle. She changed
her name to Pavarti in 1978, wears aging-hippie clothes and fills
the fridge with tofu, but she can't lose the family resemblance.
She has Tony's heft and straight-talking manner, and is every bit
as snaky as their mother. ``I wonder what her scam is this time,''
Tony says to Carmela, in a bit of dialogue that is unmistakably
his. ``Whatever it is, I'm going to be five grand lighter before
she raindances back to the commune.'' As played by Aida Turturro,
Pavarti fits right in.
</P>
<P>
   Tony explains to her that Livia's stroke was psychosomatic,
``brought on by repressed rage,'' he says, barely repressing some
rage himself. That diagnosis frees Nancy Marchand, who gets even
better and wilier as Livia, to go on weaving her way through the
plot, keeping everyone off guard about everything except the fact
that Livia is no innocent, dotty old lady.
</P>
<P>
   Carmela's parents appear, garish, believable and hilarious.
Someone's brains are shot out, splattered against a windshield. The
disparate parts of Tony's life continue to mesh in a tragicomedy.
</P>
<P>
   All this is handled with such panache that it seems as if Chase
were daring himself to raise the stakes, and meeting his own
challenge. Did he really have a choice? With viewers' expectations
wildly out of control, ``The Sopranos'' is battling its own instant
legend.
</P>
<P>
   It would be ludicrous, though, to measure this season against
the idea that every scene last year was genius. The next two
episodes (all that were available in advance) should tug
expectations back toward reality. They include wonderful touches.
Uncle Junior gets a medical parole and uses a friendly doctor's
office to do business because the government is forbidden to bug
him there. (Who knew?)
</P>
<P>
   Yet these episodes are sturdy and good rather than blazingly
terrific. It makes sense to remember that the first season didn't
really take off until episode four. Similarly, in the next episodes
plot lines are tossed out that haven't become taut or tangled yet.
</P>
<P>
   There is every reason to think they will be. As the recent
repeats of the first season demonstrated, Chase knew where he was
going. The series grew beyond an easy joke about a mob boss with a
midlife crisis, and became a family epic about characters who are
so fully developed their very thoughts are familiar to us. In
Sunday's episode, Tony asks a wary mob guy into his house, and the
man asks for a guarantee that if he walks in he'll walk out again.
We know he doesn't have to worry; Tony would never kill someone in
his own home. Few characters allow us to read them with such
certainty, while maintaining the realistic capacity for surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the series' shrewd and witty veneer, that look of made
men in loud shirts and pants hitched up under their armpits, the
original ``Sopranos'' achieves greatness because of this
psychological depth. By now viewers can name favorite scenes like
``when Carmela tells off the priest,'' a classic of astuteness and
honesty in which she lets her priest know she's onto his game of
safe flirtation.
</P>
<P>
   Given such sharp psychological definition, it is odd that the
plot about the psychiatrist still rings false, from Dr. Melfi's
unlikely motel room office to a cheap joke about the
mobster-goes-to-a-shrink movie ``Analyze This.'' And the new season
holds another pitfall in the character of Richie Aprile, a former
boss' brother. Richie is mean-spirited and vicious enough to smash
a glass coffee pot across someone's face for petty cash. Yet as
much as he offers a tantalizing distinction between a ``bad''
mobster and a ``good'' one like Tony, who loves his family and
kills only for a reason, the one-dimensional Richie is annoying,
possibly more than the creators intended.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a long, luxurious way to go in this 13-week season,
and even this early ``The Sopranos'' has displayed the depth that
is its most stunning quality. The first episode ends with Tony and
Carmela sitting at their kitchen table in a long silence. We know
them well enough to guess more than what they are thinking; we can
guess what each one thinks the other might be thinking too.

&HT;     HAITIANS SEE UNEQUAL TREATMENT IN GONZALEZ CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite growing resentment among many African
Americans about the treatment of Haitian refugees compared with
those from Cuba, Attorney General Janet Reno said Thursday that the
government will not change its policy toward illegal immigrants
from the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are different situations with respect to Cuba and with
respect to Haiti, and the nature of the government in the two
nations is different,'' she said at her weekly news conference
here.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the international custody fight over six-year-old
Elian Gonzalez, whose father lives in Cuba, many in Miami's
Haitian-American community, one of the city's largest ethnic
groups, are demanding that Haitian refugees be treated the same as
Cuban refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Activists claim that Haitians are routinely repatriated without
being offered a chance to request a hearing to determine if they
have a ``credible fear'' of persecution in their homeland, while
Cubans who are not considered a threat to society are allowed to
stay.
</P>
<P>
   Under U.S. immigration policy, Haitians and others who arrive
illegally are repatriated to their country. But the Cuban
Readjustment Act of 1966 grants any Cuban who reaches American soil
the right to stay.Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)
officials say that refugees _ Cuban or otherwise _ stopped offshore
are treated the same, that is, returned to their home country.
</P>
<P>
   Haitian groups counter that U.S. authorities sometimes treat
Cubans caught off the coast differently, allowing them to stay if
they wish.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez was found clinging to an inner tube in the Atlantic off
Florida on Thanksgiving Day. His mother and others fleeing Cuba
with him had drowned. After the U.S. Coast Guard picked him up, he
was taken to relatives in Miami. In a case that has made front-page
headlines for weeks, federal and state officials have heatedly
argued over whether he should sent back to his father.
</P>
<P>
   The Haitians also cite the example of six Cubans whose boat was
stopped by the U.S. Coast Guard last June. The six jumped from a
14-foot rowboat about 150 yards from shore in a desperate attempt
to reach the United States. But the Coast Guard scooped them up,
preventing them from reaching land. Yet because U.S. officials
admitted using harsh procedures, all six were eventually allowed
into the country.
</P>
<P>
   On New Year's Day, a ship carrying 411 Haitians was stopped off
the Florida shore. All but four of the passengers were immediately
repatriated to Haiti. The remaining four were taken to a detention
center to receive medical attention. Three have been allowed to
stay because they apparently faced persecution in Haiti. The other
case is pending.
</P>
<P>
   Haitian activists claim that the repatriation of most of those
refugees was unfair and in contrast to the extensive consideration
given to Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are asking for fairness, equality and due process,'' said
Aude Sicard, an activist with the Haitian-American Grassroots
Coalition. ``Haitian children are children too.''
</P>
<P>
   INS spokesman Russell Bergeron said, ``We treat refugees who
reach shore differently because the law treats them differently.
``If the Haitian community would like to change this, they should
tell Congress, not the INS.''

 &HT;    ABORTION RIGHTS GROUP CRITICIZES BUSH STANCE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By JENA HEATH
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The National Abortion and Reproductive Rights
Action League on Thursday ranked Gov. George W. Bush as one of the
nation's two most anti-abortion governors in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   NARAL(cq) President Kate Michelman criticized Bush for signing
seven measures in 1999 limiting access to abortion. The group also
singled out Gov. John Engler of Michigan, who is being touted as a
potential Bush running mate, for approving restrictive abortion
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, state legislatures passed 70 measures limiting
abortion, up from 62 in 1998 and 14 in 1996. They enacted 57
measures tagged by NARAL as pro-choice, up from 22 in 1998 and 19
in 1997, according to the group's annual state-by-state review.
</P>
<P>
   Michelman said the increase in pro-choice measures indicated
that, ``we're just beginning to catch up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The presidential race is a backdrop to everything today,'' she
continued. ``We do this research over an entire year. ... It leapt
out at us that Governors Bush and Engler were from states that were
most aggressive in limiting reproductive rights.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, abortion has taken a back seat in the GOP primary
contest, with conservative activists Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes the
only two candidates consistently broaching it. But as the Jan. 24
Iowa caucuses and Feb. 1 New Hampshire primary near, the issue has
emerged as a way to appeal to more conservative Republican primary
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Magazine publisher Steve Forbes, running second to Bush in most
Iowa polls, is airing an anti-abortion television ad in that state.
And two groups that oppose abortion have taken aim at Sen. John
McCain of Arizona with radio ads in South Carolina, where he trails
Bush. One of the ads accuses McCain _ who has a strongly
anti-abortion Senate voting record _ of flip-flopping on the issue
of using aborted fetuses for medical experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   When asked by voters on the campaign trail how he feels about
the issue, Bush answers, ``pro-life.'' He favors a constitutional
amendment banning abortion that would exempt incest, rape and
threats to a mother's life, but said in a broadcast interview in
November that he does not believe the country is ready for such a
move.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he would not make abortion a litmus test for
appointing Supreme Court justices, but would look for judges who
strictly interpret the Constitution. Michelman called that code for
appointing judges who would overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision
that made abortion legal. She said Bush has obscured his stand on
the contentious issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's trying to play down the issue, keep it in the
background,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   NARAL criticized a new Texas law that prevents girls younger
than 18 from legally obtaining abortions unless a doctor first
informs a parent or guardian. A girl who doesn't want to notify her
parents can seek a court order allowing her to make the decision
herself. The so-called judicial bypass is designed to protect girls
who have been sexually abused.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also approved more stringent licensing requirements for
private physicians' practices that perform more than 300 abortions
a year. The U.S. District Court in Houston upheld a challenge to
the law in December. The state is appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Kae McLaughlin, executive director of Texas Abortion and
Reproductive Rights, said Bush has gone along with efforts to chip
away at access to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they do is undermine the procedure by laying heavy
restrictions on the providers, by implementing waiting periods,
conscience clauses, things that make providing the procedure more
difficult,'' she said. ``He is on the very same path as those who
would ban abortion entirely. It's the same language.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Pojman, executive director of the Greater Austin Right to
Life Committee, local arm of the national group, applauded Bush's
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think he is implementing what the average Texan wants,''
Pojman said. ``He has not been specific about what kind of vice
president or justices he might nominate but he has said he wants
justices who will respect the Constitution and that's all we ask
for. If he does that, and we have every reason to believe he will,
we'd be very happy.''

   ABORTION _ WASHINGTON _ The NARAL Foundation for Reproductive

individual state restrictions. The study cites Texas as ``the most
actively anti-choice state in the country.'' (Heath, Austin

   POLLUTION-FINE _ WASHINGTON _ The federal government and the

   MEDICAID _ WASHINGTON _ Florida and the federal Medicaid program
paid nearly $16 million in bills that should have been sent to
local insurance companies, says a new federal audit of state
operations in 1996. The inspector general for the U.S. Health and
Human Services Department urged that the state recover the funds,
but Florida officials said they doubted they could do so. (Malone,

   MEXICO-SINGER _ Gloria Trevi, a suggestive Mexican pop singer
likened to Madonna, was arrested in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on
Thursday, according to Mexican authorities. Trevi and her manager
Sergio Andrade Sanchez are wanted for questioning in allegations
that they corrupted minor girls and held them captive as alleged
sex slaves. Trevi has both shocked and mesmerized Mexicans with her
throaty vocals, bad-girl lyrics and bump-and-grind stage act. She
was on the lam for months. (Ferriss, Cox News Service)
</P>
<P>
   HOLOCAUST _ LONDON _ Maverick historical writer David Irving was
accused in court Thursday of fabricating an order from Adolf Hitler
calling for a halt to mass murders of Jews in 1941 _ a key element
in his argument that the Nazi leader was initially opposed to the
genocide. Irving wrote in his 1977 book ``Hitler's War'' that he
had discovered ``incontrovertible evidence'' that Hitler had
ordered that there would be ``no liquidation'' of Jews. However,
Irving acknowledged in court that he based this assertion on a
misreading of a handwritten note from Gestapo Chief Heinrich
Himmler. Instead of demanding the end of the killing of all Jews,
Himmler's note suggests he spared one trainload of 1,000 Jews
transported Berlin to Riga in Latvia. (Roughton, Cox News Service).

   LOCKHEED-BIAS _A federal EEOC investigation has found that
Lockeed managers have discriminated against blacks at its Marietta
plan and its is still investigating more cases involving gender and
disabilities, according to EEOC notices obtained by the
Journal-Constitution. While Lockheed has denied the discrimination,
the EEOC found that black employees with more than 30 years
experience were passed over for promotion in favor of white
employees who had less experience or senority. Its investigator
found that blacks are disciminated against in regards to training,
promotion and assignements. The EEOC will now begin a concilliation
process, which if unsuceesful, the next step will be a lawsuit.

   CUBABOY _ MIAMI _ Even if lawyers for relatives of Elian
Gonzalez get their day in federal court, legal experts are doubtful
a judge would rule that the 6-year-old Cuban rafter should remain
in the United States. As they prepare to file suit in federal court
next week, it appears the relatives' strategy may be to try to
stall Elian's return until Congress convenes Jan. 24 in hopes of
quick passive of a bill granting the boy citizenship _ even though
President Clinton probably would not sign it. Meanwhile, Attorney
General Janet Reno said Thursday the boy should be returned quickly
so ``he can get on with his life.'' (Williams, Cox News Service).

   COLLEGE-ESSAYS _ AUSTIN, Texas _ For admissions officers at
colleges and universities across the country, the next six to seven
weeks areis crunch time, akin to a tax preparer's workload before
April 15 or a sales associate's long hours before Christmas. It's a
particularly intense kind of work. How do admissions officials stay
fresh? How do they make sure they're evaluating candidates each
candidate fairly, and not discriminating against a student because
he or she had the bad luck to be the 50th file they've read that
week, after a long day? (Santos, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED

   AIDS-MINORITIES _ Black and Hispanic men now account for more

largely to IV drug use. (McKenna, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   ASTRONOMY-BLACKHOLES _ ATLANTA _ Thursday is ``black hole day''
at the American Astronomical Society meeting. Astronomers describe

or isolated black holes in empty regions of space. (Nesmith, Cox

   WASHINGTON _ Federal health care programs and the state of
Florida paid double for medical coverage for thousands of
Floridians, a new audit of 1996 billings has concluded. The excess
cost to taxpayers was estimated at $15.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   The duplication was discovered by the inspector general for the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, who called on Florida
to recover the overpayments, including the federal share of $8.8
million.
</P>
<P>
   In the report made public on the Internet on Thursday, auditors
said the Medicaid program paid for thousands of Florida residents
who were already covered by private health maintenance
organizations under the federal Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, taxpayers were paying once through monthly fees to
the private HMOs by Medicare, the federal program for the elderly,
and again through fee-for-service Medicaid, the federal-state
program for low-income recipients.
</P>
<P>
   The study said the state should try to collect funds from HMOs,
including $4.7 million from Humana, the biggest health care group
in the state, and nearly $11.2 million from 50 other HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Florida officials, acknowledging the problem, said they have
little hope of recouping the money from the HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Florida Medicaid Management Information System maintains
two years of claims paid data, preventing us from producing the
necessary claims detail from 1996 through our carrier billing
system,'' said Ruben I. King-Shaw Jr., executive director of
Florida's Agency for Health Care Administration, in the state's
response to the findings.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the duplication problem persisted into 1998, said Judy
Hefren, the Florida official in charge of third-party Medicaid
payments.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1998, the state loaded the necessary federal data into
its computer systems to guard against the double payments, Hefren
said in an interview Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   She said that the problem has now been solved. ``There may be
isolated instances,'' she said, adding that the verification system
now alerts providers and the state health care administration when
a Medicaid applicant has private HMO coverage through Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The HHS inspector general, rejecting Florida's reasons for
failing to recover payments from HMOs, said the federal government
began providing data for fixing the duplication problem in August
1995. The inspector general also offered to work with the state in
identifying double payments to ``facilitate recovery'' of the
funds.

 &HT;    `The Sopranos,' HBO's highly acclaimed series about a mafia
family, doesn't sing in season premiere like it did in the
spectacular first season
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The disappointment you feel at the end of ``The Sopranos'''
second-season premiere only cinches last year's brilliant
achievement. The opener is a bit of a bore: smart, stylish, bold,
but unengaging at times to the point of narcolepsy. After last
season's wondrous 13-episode arc, ``The Sopranos'' suddenly seems
in search of a reason to go on.
</P>
<P>
   The show itself appears to acknowledge this, when early Sunday
night its principal characters, suburban mob boss Tony Soprano
(James Gandolfini) and his wife, Carmela (Edie Falco), stare
vacantly at each other in bed while a soundtrack reels with Frank
Sinatra's wistful ``It Was a Very Good Year.''
</P>
<P>
   That first season was more than a very good year. Created by
David Chase (``Northern Exposure,'' ``I'll Fly Away''), HBO's
``Sopranos'' was as good as TV gets, an aria in a medium of white
noise. It made high art out of low lives, a worthy sequel to Mafia
classics ``The Godfather'' and ``GoodFellas.''
</P>
<P>
   A huggable thug, Tony Soprano became TV's most loyal family man.
He dutifully served two clans: the nuclear family under his
two-story-with-pool contemporary in suburban New Jersey, which
includes two teenage kids, and the New York-connected crime family
headquartered inside the Bada Bing strip club. Straddling both
worlds, and at the very center of this series, was his aging mother
Livia (Nancy Marchand), a brutally brittle woman who cannily
engineered an attempted hit on her son.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure of tending _ and ending _ so many lives drove Tony
to psychiatrist Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco), who prescribed
regular therapy and a Prozac diet. The show's genius resided in
many places _ even the soundtrack was a crankin' beauty _ but its
skill at mining the inner lives of people who otherwise seemed all
itchy, homicidal surface might be its most singular feat.
</P>
<P>
   That was then. Sunday's return doesn't live up to where ``The
Sopranos'' left off, but only because it hardly left a thing. With
Livia confined to a hospital bed, and goggle-eyed Uncle Junior
(Dominic Chianese) confined to a jail cell (after the hit he
ordered on Tony failed), there's little for Tony to do but swagger
and swear.
</P>
<P>
   Tony's loose-cannon nephew Christopher (Michael Imperioli) now
oversees a brokerage house _ this is an up-to-the-second mob
portrayal. Dr. Melfi, her life in danger after the botched hit, now
sees clients in a room at a roadside motel. New is Tony's New Age
sister Janice (Aida Turturro), who returns from Seattle and drives
Tony nuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm gonna be five grand lighter before she rain dances back to
the commune,'' Tony grumps to Carmela.
</P>
<P>
   So with little but his criminal activity and pestering sister to
occupy him, Tony's now just ... a thug. Both his inner and outer
demons are little more than annoyances. What's to root for?
</P>
<P>
   But there's good news: The meandering ends in the third episode,
when ``The Sopranos'' returns to its staggeringly marvelous ways. A
cold, angling challenger arrives for Tony, and suddenly, in the
transformative manner of this series, he again becomes another
vulnerable lug in a fast-changing world _ just like us.
</P>
<P>
   That's what ``The Sopranos'' does better than anything else:
puts us inside the unlikeliest lives and makes us see something of
ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   It's not always pretty. But it's incomparable TV.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    FEW SCHOOLS SIGN UP FOR SAFETY SHOWS
 &HT;    Eds: Cox-state sites listed at end of story.
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Jan 16.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's 110,000 elementary and secondary
schools have been slow to sign up for a series of 10 monthly
satellite-aided telecasts on how to make schools safer.
</P>
<P>
   Announced by President Clinton in June, two months after the
school shootings in Littleton, Colo., the series is being produced
by the National Education Association with technical help donated
by FutureView, a Washington-based programming firm.
</P>
<P>
   The NEA's $500,000 effort was endorsed by three federal
departments and the Learning First Alliance, which consists of the
NEA and 11 other leading education groups that together have more
than 10 million members.
</P>
<P>
   But less than one week before three satellites transmit the
first episode at 2 p.m. EST Thursday (Jan. 20), there are signs
that many of those members aren't interested:
</P>
<P>
   _ Fewer than 130 districts and schools applied for and received
one of the 1,000 free satellite dishes offered by EchoStar
Communications Corp., a direct broadcast satellite company in
Littleton, to public schools that wanted to receive the telecast
from one of the firm's satellites.
</P>
<P>
   _ Only 64 of the more than 6,000 educational institutions that
already had dishes had registered on the Education Department's
Internet site to receive the show from other satellites on C-band
or KU-band transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   Though advance registration is optional, that is far below the
410 schools and school districts that have signed up to get another
of next week's Education Department shows, which will concern early
childhood education.
</P>
<P>
   EchoStar donated its satellite transmission time for the safety
series. The NEA purchased the time on the other two satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers insisted that they can overcome the early signs of
apathy.
</P>
<P>
   The programs ``will bring this critically needed school safety
information to every school district in the country,'' said NEA
president Bob Chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, school was out in June'' when Clinton announced
the program, said EchoStar spokesman Marc Lumpkin. ``I think we'll
get a lot more schools to sign up for the free dishes as more learn
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Producers said interest in the first episode, ``Reasons for
Hope,'' is intense in the places where segments of the first
episode were videotaped.
</P>
<P>
   One part of the first episode shows a model program in Columbia,
S.C., aimed at developing appropriate social behavior by children
in first and second grades, and another shows local leaders in
Colorado discussing the lessons they learned from the shootings at
Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, every public school will be sent the program
by South Carolina ETV, and in Colorado, the state education
association will sponsor a showing in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is we still have a lot of free satellite dishes
for schools that want them,'' said Roberta Hantgen of the NEA.
</P>
<P>
   She said that starting with next month's show, Apple Computer
Inc. will cybercast the series on its Apple Learning Interchange
Internet site. The National Cable Television Association is also
considering the possibility of asking its members to carry the
shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Building partnerships is an evolutionary process,'' Hantgen
said. ``So we're not discouraged at starting off with a small
core.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, schools can apply for free satellites at
http://www.safeschoolsnow.org, and satellite-dish operators can
find directions for downloading the school-safety programs at
http://www.nea.org/echostar/schedule.html. To find out if there are
public viewing options in your area, click on ``Reasons for Hope''

&HT;     U.S. HAS HAD AS MANY FAILED PRESIDENTS AS SUCCESSES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, Jan. 16)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the new century rolled around, ratings of the
outstanding men and women of the past 100 years could be found
everywhere _ on TV talk shows, in newspapers and magazines and at
gatherings of individuals interested in history.
</P>
<P>
   The analyses produced no startling revelations or revisions of
the past. Since our tendency is to canonize leaders who share our
philosophy, some Republicans listed Ronald Reagan ahead of Franklin
D. Roosevelt, while Democrats invariably placed Roosevelt far ahead
of Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Each of this year's presidential hopefuls appears to have found
a past president to emulate, just as Roosevelt patterned his New
Deal to some degree on the legacy of Woodrow Wilson and Reagan
sought to resuscitate the starchy image of Calvin Coolidge.
``Silent Cal'' was a tax-cutting Yankee who, as an apostle of the
status quo, believed that ``the chief business of America is
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Reagan's effort recalled the comment of Alice Roosevelt
Longworth, Theodore Roosevelt's tart-tongued daughter, when she was
informed that Coolidge had died. ``How could they tell?'' asked the
acerbic Alice.
</P>
<P>
   It is interesting to note that the focus of the last few weeks
has been exclusively on those presidents who were successful in
running the country. None of the prognosticators paid attention to
those who had failed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the 210-year saga of our government, starting with George
Washington's first inaugural, our destiny has resided in the hands
of about as many poor presidents as outstanding ones.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of the poor presidents may have been honest and
able, they simply failed to fill the shoes of giants who preceded
them in the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th century, William Henry Harrison, John Tyler, Zachary
Taylor, Millard Fillmore, James Buchanan, Andrew Johnson, Ulysses
S. Grant, Rutherford B. Hayes, James A. Garfield, Chester A. Arthur
and Benjamin Harrison could not ignite that latent brilliance that
many presidents possess.
</P>
<P>
   They, therefore, are among the forgotten figures of history. In
the years before and after the Civil War, most found the presidency
to be an office that was too large for their small talents.
</P>
<P>
   The United States fared better in the 20th century. Fewer
failures held the reins of government.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Roosevelt, who succeeded to the presidency upon the
assassination of William McKinley in 1901, was a charismatic
bombshell, ready to explode in any direction that merited
presidential attention. He and Woodrow Wilson forged the modern
activist presidency that made America a world power and inaugurated
far-reaching reforms designed to better the lot of the people.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt's hand-chosen successor, William Howard Taft, was,
like Jimmy Carter, a kindly, decent man who lacked the leadership
qualities required of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Warren G. Harding, an Ohio newspaper publisher who was
inaugurated in 1921, knew from the beginning that the job was too
big for him. In 1923, as the tawdriness of the Teapot Dome scandal
began to leak out, Harding lamented, ``My God, this is a hell of a
job. I have no trouble with my enemies ... But my damn friends,
they're the ones that keep me walking the floor nights.''
</P>
<P>
   Harding was succeeded by Coolidge, who spent much of his
five-year presidency napping in the White House while business and
industrial leaders pretty much ran the country.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Herbert Hoover, a talented engineer, who probably
would have been an outstanding president had the Great Depression
not come crashing down on him and the nation. For all his
experience feeding starving Europeans during World War I and
serving as a highly successful commerce secretary in the Harding
and Coolidge administrations, he lacked the imagination to create
federal programs that would provide work for jobless Americans and
help save their homes and farms from foreclosure.
</P>
<P>
   In a year-end summary of the last century, four Washington
reporters and their moderator appearing on a televised talk show
said Time Magazine had erred in selecting Albert Einstein as the
person of the century. Although they took no vote, they appeared to
agree that the honor should be shared by Winston Churchill and
Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   They recalled how the defiant Churchill stood alone against
Adolf Hitler's bloody air assault on England in 1940. His
resistance to the Nazis, who bombed London night after night, was
indeed heroic. But what the panelists failed to note was that
Churchill could not have held out against Hitler had Franklin D.
Roosevelt not been in the White House providing him with fighter
planes, submarines and other weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in lauding King's magnificent leadership of the civil
rights movement in the 1960s, they failed to mention the fact that
the monumental legislation that dismantled racial segregation in
public accommodations, voting booths and housing was passed through
Congress by Lyndon Johnson. LBJ, a son of the Confederacy, was
possibly the most brilliant legislative strategist in American
history.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Johnson is remembered for his commitment to the
tragic war in Vietnam rather than his achievements on the domestic
front.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Nixon likewise is seen only as the president who was
forced from office by the Watergate scandal, not as the outstanding
foreign policy architect among the presidents of the second half of
the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Bill Clinton faces a
similar assessment despite the good he has done in guiding the
nation's prosperity, aiding education and trying to settle
longstanding foreign disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Looking over the current crop of presidential hopefuls, we
should try to determine which candidate can best provide valorous,
enlightened leadership in time of crisis, as did the giants of the
past.

 &HT;    EFFORTS TO KEEP CUBAN BOY IN U.S. WILL LIKELY FAIL, EXPERTS SAY
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    Moving in (i) international, (w) Washington and (a) national
categories 
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS 
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Protests, tearful appeals, angry vows and legal
maneuvering have so far managed to keep 6-year-old Cuban rafter
Elian Gonzalez in this country, but legal experts say those
strategies are likely to falter now that the fight over the boy's
future is headed to federal court.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the new legal proceedings and the prospect of
a move in Congress to grant the boy citizenship or legal residency
could drag things out for weeks or even months, adding to the
turmoil of a very young boy who has already lost his mother and
nearly drowned at sea himself, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``This protracted limbo status is in and of itself
unconscionable,'' said Bernard Perlmutter, director of the
University of Miami's Children and Youth Law Clinic. ``Both sides
share the blame in subjecting this child to needless emotional
distress.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno made much the same point Thursday,
speaking to reporters at her weekly press briefing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just got to think about that little boy,'' she said.
``Let's figure out what we do, as soon as possible, and do it in a
dignified and thoughtful way to get him back to his father.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Reno brushed aside a Florida family court judge's
decision to grant temporary custody of Elian to his great uncle in
Miami. She reaffirmed a Jan. 5 decision by U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Commissioner Doris Meissner that the boy should be
returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Reno also encouraged Elian's Miami relatives to file a lawsuit
in federal court, saying that is the proper venue for the matter.
The family's lawyers said they will do so next week.
</P>
<P>
   Their delay may seem curious, but experts say it could be part
of a strategy to string the case along, perhaps hoping that
opposition to keeping Elian here will fade, that Reno's resolve
will falter, or that congressional action might open a new avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to protract all of this so somebody in the end will
shrug their shoulders and give up,'' Perlmutter said. ``But I think
federal officials believe there are important principles at stake
and they want this matter resolved promptly.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian was found floating in an inner tube off the coast of Fort
Lauderdale on Thanksgiving Day. His mother and nine other people
drowned after their small boat capsized while they attempted to
flee Cuba. The boy somehow survived, only to become the center of
an international tug-of-war, with his father and Castro's
government on one side and his Miami relatives and Miami's Cuban
exile community on the other.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks after Thanksgiving, INS officials traveled to Cuba
and interviewed his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, determining that
he has been a good father and wants his child back. Legal scholars
say that determination is the key to the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every legal move made by the family has been aimed at wresting
custody from the father,'' said David Abraham, another University
of Miami law professor who specializes in immigration law. ``They
want custody granted to somebody who wants the boy to stay in this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   That explains why the family went to Miami-Dade County family
court late last week, Abraham said. ``They were trying to do an end
run around the fact that they have no case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Reno blew that strategy away with her announcement Wednesday
that the state court had no jurisdiction, Abraham said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immigration matters are the exclusive domain of the federal
government,'' he said. ``You can't have the individual states
setting their own immigration policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving the case to federal court likely means the family will
lose, scholars agree. That's because both immigration and
international law solidly back the notion that a child with one
dead parent should go to the other parent, if the surviving parent
is deemed fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Cuba is a communist country doesn't make the
father not the father, or a bad father,'' Abraham said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Elian's Miami relatives have been careful to argue
that while Gonzalez may be fit, he is unable to speak his true
feelings because he is controlled by Castro, and that the
deprivations and taunting Elian would face if he returned to Cuba
would amount to abuse.
</P>
<P>
   But they may never get far enough in federal court to make those
arguments. Instead, a federal judge may first ask why they are even
attempting to speak on the boy's behalf, since federal officials
have already determined that role belongs to the father, experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're going to have a hard time even arguing that
they have standing,'' said Michael D. Ray, president of the South
Florida chapter of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the family makes it past that hurdle to an evidentiary
hearing, they must convince a judge the boy deserves asylum here _
another hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just say he needs asylum because of the general bad
conditions in a country,'' Ray said. ``It has to be particular
action by the government directed at an individual. In this case,
Elian is a hero in Cuba, so how are they going to convince a judge
that he would be persecuted if he went back?''
</P>
<P>
   The family's other strategy _ to stall until Congress reconvenes

   MIAMI _ Protests, tearful appeals, angry vows and legal
maneuvering have so far managed to keep 6-year-old Cuban rafter
Elian Gonzalez in this country, but legal experts say those
strategies are likely to falter now that the fight over the boy's
future is headed to federal court.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the new legal proceedings and the prospect of
a move in Congress to grant the boy citizenship or legal residency
could drag things out for weeks or even months, adding to the
turmoil of a very young boy who has already lost his mother and
nearly drowned at sea himself, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``This protracted limbo status is in and of itself
unconscionable,'' said Bernard Perlmutter, director of the
University of Miami's Children and Youth Law Clinic. ``Both sides
share the blame in subjecting this child to needless emotional
distress.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno made much the same point Thursday,
speaking to reporters at her weekly press briefing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just got to think about that little boy,'' she said.
``Let's figure out what we do, as soon as possible, and do it in a
dignified and thoughtful way to get him back to his father.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Reno brushed aside a Florida family court judge's
decision to grant temporary custody of Elian to his great uncle in
Miami. She reaffirmed a Jan. 5 decision by U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Commissioner Doris Meissner that the boy should be
returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Reno also encouraged Elian's Miami relatives to file a lawsuit
in federal court, saying that is the proper venue for the matter.
The family's lawyers said they will do so next week.
</P>
<P>
   Their delay may seem curious, but experts say it could be part
of a strategy to string the case along, perhaps hoping that
opposition to keeping Elian here will fade, that Reno's resolve
will falter, or that congressional action might open a new avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to protract all of this so somebody in the end will
shrug their shoulders and give up,'' Perlmutter said. ``But I think
federal officials believe there are important principles at stake
and they want this matter resolved promptly.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian was found floating in an inner tube off the coast of Fort
Lauderdale on Thanksgiving Day. His mother and nine other people
drowned after their small boat capsized while they attempted to
flee Cuba. The boy somehow survived, only to become the center of
an international tug-of-war, with his father and Castro's
government on one side and his Miami relatives and Miami's Cuban
exile community on the other.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks after Thanksgiving, INS officials traveled to Cuba
and interviewed his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, determining that
he has been a good father and wants his child back. Legal scholars
say that determination is the key to the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every legal move made by the family has been aimed at wresting
custody from the father,'' said David Abraham, another University
of Miami law professor who specializes in immigration law. ``They
want custody granted to somebody who wants the boy to stay in this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   That explains why the family went to Miami-Dade County family
court late last week, Abraham said. ``They were trying to do an end
run around the fact that they have no case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Reno blew that strategy away with her announcement Wednesday
that the state court had no jurisdiction, Abraham said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immigration matters are the exclusive domain of the federal
government,'' he said. ``You can't have the individual states
setting their own immigration policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving the case to federal court likely means the family will
lose, scholars agree. That's because both immigration and
international law solidly back the notion that a child with one
dead parent should go to the other parent, if the surviving parent
is deemed fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Cuba is a communist country doesn't make the
father not the father, or a bad father,'' Abraham said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Elian's Miami relatives have been careful to argue
that while Gonzalez may be fit, he is unable to speak his true
feelings because he is controlled by Castro, and that the
deprivations and taunting Elian would face if he returned to Cuba
would amount to abuse.
</P>
<P>
   But they may never get far enough in federal court to make those
arguments. Instead, a federal judge may first ask why they are even
attempting to speak on the boy's behalf, since federal officials
have already determined that role belongs to the father, experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're going to have a hard time even arguing that
they have standing,'' said Michael D. Ray, president of the South
Florida chapter of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the family makes it past that hurdle to an evidentiary
hearing, they must convince a judge the boy deserves asylum here _
another hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just say he needs asylum because of the general bad
conditions in a country,'' Ray said. ``It has to be particular
action by the government directed at an individual. In this case,
Elian is a hero in Cuba, so how are they going to convince a judge
that he would be persecuted if he went back?''
</P>
<P>
   The family's other strategy _ to stall until Congress reconvenes
on Jan. 24 in the hopes that a special bill will give Elian U.S.
citizenship or residency _ also faces hurdles. President Clinton
would have to sign such a bill, and he has made it clear he backs
Meissner's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``These bills are introduced in Congress all the time but are
rarely successful,'' Perlmutter said. ``In this case, it would be
for a child of a very tender age, and over the objection of his
father.''
</P>

AT THE MOVIES: IRVING ON `CIDER HOUSE' 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ John Irving, one of the nation's most celebrated
novelists, says he has no patience whatsoever with authors who sell
their books to Hollywood and then complain all the way to the bank
about the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not one who feels writers should complain about films made
from their novels, even if they're bad,'' said Irving, who adapted
his book ``The Cider House Rules,'' for the screen. ``What do they
have to moan about? It's a kind of childish whining. If they're so
purist in their views of novels not working out as films, then
don't sell the rights. No one's twisting your arm to sell the
rights in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Irving admitted that his experience in Hollywood had pleased
him, especially ``The Cider House Rules,'' which has generally
earned positive reviews and moved into more theaters around the
nation last week. ``I feel as proud of that film as any of my
novels, and I never thought I'd say that about a film based on a
novel of mine,'' he said. ``Cider House,'' directed by Lasse
Hallstrom, features Tobey Maguire, Charlize Theron, Michael Caine,
Delroy Lindo and Paul Rudd. It is a saga about an orphan named
Homer Wells who embarks on a journey of self-discovery after
leaving an unconventional but loving orphanage.
</P>
<P>
   Two other films have been adapted from Irving's novels: ``The
World According to Garp,'' directed by George Roy Hill, and ``The
Hotel New Hampshire,'' directed by Tony Richardson. More recently,
``Simon Birch'' was loosely suggested by an Irving book, ``A Prayer
for Owen Meany.''
</P>
<P>
   Irving, who said he was happy with all three of those films, had
not written a screenplay from one of his novels until ``Cider
House.'' (A memoir of his experiences on that film, ``My Movie
Business,'' was published last year by Random House).
</P>
<P>
   He said he found writing a screenplay far easier than writing a
novel. With a movie, ``you don't have the same kind of
responsibility for the language,'' he said. ``It's the absolute
attention to the language that's essential for a novelist. That's
not the case for a screenwriter. As a screenwriter you're simply
erecting the scaffolding for a building that someone else is going
to make, and that someone else is the director. When I feel like
being a director, I'll write a novel.''
</P>
<P>
   The director and novelist are, in many ways, mirror images, he
said. ``When you are writing a novel, you are demonstrating to a
reader exactly how something looks and sounds and smells and feels.
The exactness of details is in your hands. In films that's the job
of the director, not the writer.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing a novel takes Irving about four or five years. ``I'm
just now creeping to the end of my 10th novel,'' he said. It took
him only six months or so to write the ``Cider House'' screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an exercise in writing, a screenplay is pretty easy
compared to a novel,'' he said. ``What's not easy is finding the
right people to write it for: the director, the producer, the
actors.''
</P>
<P>
   Irving has completed his second screenplay from one of his
novels, ``A Son of the Circus.'' He said he had been working on the
script, off and on, for about 10 years. The film is tentatively set
to start production in the next few months, with a cast that
includes Jessica Lange and Jeff Bridges. But Irving, speaking like
a Hollywood veteran, said nothing was ever certain until filming
actually began.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty optimistic,'' he said. ``But you never want to say
anything is definite. `Cider House' almost went into production
three times. And it was almost canceled. You never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Roar, but No `Lion'
</P>
<P>
   Julie Taymor, who earned two Tony Awards for the Broadway
version of ``The Lion King,'' has been working for years on the
screen adaptation of Shakespeare's ``Titus Andronicus.'' She staged
this violent drama Off Broadway at the Theater for a New Audience
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the play,'' said Ms. Taymor, whose newly opened film
version, ``Titus,'' stars Anthony Hopkins and Jessica Lange. ``And
it so lends itself to cinema. The story is incredible. You've got
eight or 10 great roles. And it's about something that's
extraordinarily timely, violence. The story demands that we examine
the very root of violence in a time when ethnic cleansing, genocide
and racism have almost ceased to shock us.'' Nearly as an
afterthought, she said, ``It's a tremendous contrast to `Lion
King.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Taymor, one of the most provocative and imaginative
directors and designers in the performing arts, said she realized
that her first film had some similarities to her own ``Lion King.''
Both have powerful animal imagery. Both bear the imprint of
Shakespeare. ```The Lion King' is loosely based on `Hamlet,' and it
has a simple mythic story which is similar to `Titus,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The new film, which is littered with ritual killings, torture,
suicide and rape, involves the return of the Roman general Titus
Andronicus, (Hopkins) after a long war. Soon he confronts the
revenge of Tamora, queen of the Goths, the new wife of the emperor,
for the ritual killing of her son.
</P>
<P>
   To Ms. Taymor, the saga of revenge and violence is nothing less
than Shakespeare's most relevant, disturbing and most entertaining
work of art. ``It's about how one becomes violent, what drives
someone to violence, whether it's war or religious belief or lust
or vengeance,'' she said. ``Look at Littelton. Or Timor. Or Bosnia.
There's nothing in `Titus' that's not happening today.''
</P>
<P>
   The film, now being shown in New York and Los Angeles, expands
around the nation next Friday. Ms. Taymor had never made a feature
film before ``Titus,'' and she said she found the experience far
more exhausting than the theater. ``What surprised me were the
complications getting it done, the sheer tenacity you need to keep
going,'' she said. There were money problems, poor weather in Rome
and Croatia, where the film was made, language problems with the
crews, bureaucratic complications. ``It was like manipulating an
army,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theater is consuming, too, but it's far more
controllable,'' she said. ``You're in one city, you're in the same
theater. You're not dealing with the fact that the sun goes down at
3 in the afternoon in Croatia, and then it becomes freezing cold.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Taymor has several film projects planned, including a
comedy, ``The Transposed Head,'' based on a story by Thomas Mann.
Several other offbeat projects are also in the works. ``I'm not
attracted to the easy,'' she said with a laugh.
</P>

<P>
   Conspiracy of the Heart
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Stone denies that he's turning more mellow. But this
filmmaker, who eagerly welcomed controversy with movies like
``Nixon,'' ``J.F.K.'' and ``Natural Born Killers,'' is clearly
embarking _ at least for the moment _ on a creative path that's
different from the one he has followed over the last decade.
Instead of dealing with conspiracies, politics and the dark side,
Stone is turning his attention to a love story.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, an Oliver Stone love story.
</P>
<P>
   He is now in Poland, scouting locations for the film, ``Beyond
Borders,'' which focuses on a romance over more than a decade
between two relief workers. One will be played by Kevin Costner,
who was a star of Stone's most controversial film, ``J.F.K.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone, said he was making the new film for one reason: ``My
mother.'' She has implored him for years to make a love story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promised my mother before it was too late that I'd do a love
story,'' said Stone, who said his mother, Jacqueline Goddet Stone,
who lives in New York, was in her late 70s. ``She always loved
`Gone With The Wind.' She always said I'd do a great love story.
This is the complete opposite of football, of `Natural Born
Killers.'''
</P>
<P>
   Of his mother, Stone said, ``I'd love to make her happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone's current film, ``Any Given Sunday,'' is one of his more
mainstream and successful movies in recent years. An intimate look
at pro football _ with its moneyed owners and universe of players,
coaches, team doctors, sportswriters and party girls _ the film,
starring Al Pacino, has taken in more than $60 million and seems
headed for financial success. The reviews were mixed. Stephen
Holden, in The New York Times, said that the movie was a
``viscerally charged, razzle-dazzle ode to professional football as
a blood sport,'' but that it was marked by a ``ludicrously upbeat''
finale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any Given Sunday'' came about because of Stone's fascination
with football as a child in Manhattan, he said. He collected
football cards, tracked sports statistics and followed the careers
of his heroes, Y.A. Tittle, Dick Butkus and Johnny Unitas. Those
former football stars worked on the film; Butkus and Unitas
appeared in the movie as coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film really began with my nostalgia for football in the
'50s, which is so different from the game now,'' said Stone.
``There's no team loyalty now. It's all about making money. It's
about greed. There's this volatility in the culture that's apparent
now in sports as well as films. It doesn't make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning to his forthcoming film, Stone was asked if the movie
would be a traditional love story. ``Nothing is traditional with
me,'' he said.

 HOLLYWOOD: a laugh.

   Conspiracy of the Heart
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Stone denies that he's turning more mellow. But this
filmmaker, who eagerly welcomed controversy with movies like
``Nixon,'' ``J.F.K.'' and ``Natural Born Killers,'' is clearly
embarking _ at least for the moment _ on a creative path that's
different from the one he has followed over the last decade.
Instead of dealing with conspiracies, politics and the dark side,
Stone is turning his attention to a love story.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, an Oliver Stone love story.
</P>
<P>
   He is now in Poland, scouting locations for the film, ``Beyond
Borders,'' which focuses on a romance over more than a decade
between two relief workers. One will be played by Kevin Costner,
who was a star of Stone's most controversial film, ``J.F.K.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone, said he was making the new film for one reason: ``My
mother.'' She has implored him for years to make a love story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promised my mother before it was too late that I'd do a love
story,'' said Stone, who said his mother, Jacqueline Goddet Stone,
who lives in New York, was in her late 70s. ``She always loved
`Gone With The Wind.' She always said I'd do a great love story.
This is the complete opposite of football, of `Natural Born
Killers.'''
</P>
<P>
   Of his mother, Stone said, ``I'd love to make her happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone's current film, ``Any Given Sunday,'' is one of his more
mainstream and successful movies in recent years. An intimate look
at pro football _ with its moneyed owners and universe of players,
coaches, team doctors, sportswriters and party girls _ the film,
starring Al Pacino, has taken in more than $60 million and seems
headed for financial success. The reviews were mixed. Stephen
Holden, in The New York Times, said that the movie was a
``viscerally charged, razzle-dazzle ode to professional football as
a blood sport,'' but that it was marked by a ``ludicrously upbeat''
finale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any Given Sunday'' came about because of Stone's fascination
with football as a child in Manhattan, he said. He collected
football cards, tracked sports statistics and followed the careers
of his heroes, Y.A. Tittle, Dick Butkus and Johnny Unitas. Those
former football stars worked on the film; Butkus and Unitas
appeared in the movie as coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film really began with my nostalgia for football in the
'50s, which is so different from the game now,'' said Stone.
``There's no team loyalty now. It's all about making money. It's
about greed. There's this volatility in the culture that's apparent
now in sports as well as films. It doesn't make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning to his forthcoming film, Stone was asked if the movie
would be a traditional love story. ``Nothing is traditional with
me,'' he said.

 &HT;    Thriller taps into Cuban ties
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When ``I, Che Guevara'' (HarperCollins, $24) was published this
month, there were a few good reviews but little buzz about the
pseudonymous author, John Blackthorn. That all changed Wednesday,
when former U.S. Sen. and presidential candidate Gary Hart
announced he was Blackthorn.
</P>
<P>
   Set in contemporary Cuba, the novel explores what would happen
if Che Guevara had not been killed in 1967 and re-emerged as
Ernesto Blanco to lead a peaceful grass-roots revolt. Fidel Castro,
meanwhile, has offered to step aside and allow free elections if
the United States ends its embargo.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the States, Victoria Savidge, a past-her-prime reporter
for an all-politics TV network whose aim is ``all scandal, all the
time,'' heads to Cuba for an interview with Blanco. Romance and
attempted assassinations follow.
</P>
<P>
   It's a thriller with a message, Hart said in a telephone
interview from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to use Cuba as a mirror of our own excesses and to
show the kind of corruption that exists throughout the whole
political system,'' said Hart, 63. ``And it's only gotten worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The media is not treated kindly in the novel, but Hart insists
that's only part of the corruption. ``It's a parody of the media's
excesses. It's not an act of revenge,'' said Hart, whose 1988
presidential campaign was derailed when the media exposed his
relationship with Donna Rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to show the effects of corruption and what would
happen if a true democratic movement would arise,'' said Hart, who
has visited Cuba and dined with Castro on several occasions in the
past three years. On some visits, he was asked to act as an
unofficial messenger between the two governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I used a pseudonym in the first place,'' said Hart,
who wrote a previous novel under the Blackthorn pseudonym (``Sins
of the Father'') and another thriller with Defense Secretary
William Cohen (``Double Man''). ``I didn't want to jeopardize my
usefulness as a conduit. But I was getting into the `Primary
Colors' problem with Anonymous, so I decided to go public.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Death in the family: Jervey Tervalon didn't have to go far to
find an idea for his second novel, ``Dead Above Ground'' (Pocket
Books, $23.95). The taut story of murder and revenge in New Orleans
is based on a tragedy that struck Tervalon's family in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   ``A cousin of mine decided she wanted to have an affair with
this man,'' Tervalon says. ``My grandmother warned her not to date
him, that he kills women. But my cousin said he was so
good-looking, she couldn't resist.''
</P>
<P>
   When the affair went sour and the cousin attempted to break up
with him, Tervalon says, she was found floating in the Mississippi
River in a trunk. In the novel, the main character, ``Mama'' Du
Champ, is modeled after Tervalon's grandmother. The strong-willed
woman tells a captivating tale of revenge, murder, pimps,
prostitutes, voodoo and a baby born to one woman and raised by
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to change a great deal of it, because often the factual
material was more bizarre than anyone would believe,'' says
Tervalon, a 41-year-old California screenwriter whose first novel,
``Understand This,'' dealt with teenage gang violence in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also wanted to protect my relatives,'' Tervalon says,
``because some of the principals are still alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Tervalon will sign his book at 7 tonight at Chapter 11 bookstore
at Ansley Mall, 1544 Piedmont Ave. 404-872-7986.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Literary event: Just because Pat Conroy bowed out of a
proposed deal to write another sequel to ``Gone With the Wind''
doesn't mean he harbors any hard feelings toward Margaret Mitchell.
The author of ``Beach Music'' will be guest speaker Wednesday at
the Atlanta History Center for a benefit for the Margaret Mitchell
House and Museum. A coffee and dessert reception will follow the 7
p.m. lecture at McElreath Hall, 130 W. Paces Ferry Road. Tickets
are $20 and can be purchased by calling 770-578-3502.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Southern lit: William Gay (``The Long Home''), Fred Chappell
(``Look Back All the Green Valley''), Judy Goldman (``Slow Way
Back'') and Robert Morgan (``Gap Creek'') are among the finalists
for the Southeastern Booksellers Association's Book Award.
Nonfiction nominees are Janisse Ray (``Ecology of a Cracker
Childhood''), Bobbie Ann Mason (``Clear Springs'') and Ross Yockey
(``McColl: The Man With America's Money''). The awards will be
presented at a dinner at 7 p.m. April 1 at the Westin Atlanta North
at Perimeter. Information: 1-803-252-7755.

 &HT;    Call for therapy is no guarantee of results
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who knows how long it had been since John Rocker held in his
hand a No. 2 lead pencil, puzzling over A, B, C, D or None of the
Above? With its clean pink eraser and fresh yellow paint, the
simple instrument might as well have been a crowbar, prying open
the skull that people think is off-center.
</P>
<P>
   But even before Rocker took himself _ with no great enthusiasm _
to Baltimore for psychological testing, he was being recommended
for therapy. Anyone who said the things he said must need help.
Anyone that far outside the box we know as ``normal'' needs help
getting in it.
</P>
<P>
   A generation ago, Woody Allen made it almost fashionable to talk
of seeing one's ``analyst.'' Two and three times a week. In the
heyday of psychoanalysis, it was a New York thing. Neuroses were
badges of honor.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Americans might not talk casually of seeing their
analyst _ the word's overtones are too darkly Freudian _ but
millions see a therapist regularly. They share more with their
therapist than they do with their family, friends or any clergyman,
all in the hope that they can find whatever it is that will make
them happy, fulfilled or just less anxious about life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Triumph of the Therapeutic,'' the sociologist Philip Rieff
once called it. If therapy has not entirely replaced religion it
has established itself firmly alongside, drawing upon the
peculiarly American faith in self-improvement and the newer belief
that self-knowledge _ and with it peace of mind _ is found through
psychological techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Americans not only expect happiness as a birthright _ as
promised in the Declaration of Independence _ but also exalt the
role of the specialist and the expert.
</P>
<P>
   Thus have therapists become our happiness experts, the Mr.
Goodwrenches who could help us look under the hood and show us what
screw was loose.
</P>
<P>
   If Rocker himself has made known no strong desire for therapy,
it's widely taken for granted he needs it. ``Get him into
therapy,'' a caller on a sports talk show said the other night,
compressing, in so many words, the sentiments of others.
</P>
<P>
   But what exactly is that going to do?
</P>
<P>
   Not all psychologists agree on therapy's limits or its
possibilities. Does it address a patient's personality, which can
be as superficial as the clothing he wears, or does it address the
character that makes him who he is? Can it address a patient's
character?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think therapy has been vastly oversold,'' says Jack Feldman,
professor of psychology at Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would argue that psychotherapy helps people become who they
truly are,'' says John Paddock, a psychologist with a practice in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   What connects the two extremes is the belief in being oneself.
</P>
<P>
   But many people in therapy have to first find themselves, and
nothing guarantees that everyone will like the result. It might
just be that the John Rocker we know is the truest John Rocker
we'll ever see.
</P>
<P>
   In such a case, therapy isn't so much self-discovery as
self-control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a culture where someone who's out of the norm is
deemed in need of therapy, and that's not always the case,''
Feldman says. ``And it doesn't mean it's going to change anything.
If John Rocker's a jerk, he's going to stay a jerk. He may just
learn to keep his mouth shut when the press is around.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an uncomfortable fact for psychologists and others in the
mental health field that Nazis convicted at Nuremburg did not feel
particularly misunderstood or at loose ends. This is not, of
course, to elevate the importance of a 25-year-old relief pitcher
to the level of war criminals. But when Adolf Eichmann was captured
and tried in Jerusalem in the 1960s, people were appalled that he
showed no pathological symptoms. In The New Yorker, Hannah Arendt
coined the phrase ``the banality of evil,'' outraging thousands who
believed someone obviously monstrous could have come off to as an
everyday bureaucrat.
</P>
<P>
   If Rocker defies the everyday, some psychologists wonder what
exactly Major League Baseball wanted to find out when it had him
undergo psychological tests. And whatever the results of those
tests, they divide on what therapy might or might not do for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Therapy does generally work, but I don't know what people
expect,'' says Robyn M. Dawes, a psychologist at Carnegie-Mellon
University in Pittsburgh and a prominent researcher in the field.
``What I'd want to know is what the referral question was. You
don't just have someone take a battery of tests. There's something
you want to know, and I don't know what that is.''
</P>
<P>
   Paddock, who is also curious about Major League Baseball's
referral question, uses tests as ``a kind of actuarial predictor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No test is infallible,'' he says, ``but they have been shown
to be valid.''
</P>
<P>
   And they often point the way toward one kind of therapy or
another. ``Broadly construed,'' says Paddock, ``I do not see people
in psychotherapy as sick or crazy, but as people who are having
significant problems in life. I think of depression, for example,
as a problem in living more than as illness.''
</P>
<P>
   For most people in therapy, there is a certain ``logic'' to the
way they see the world. It might be a perverse logic, but without
it the world would make no sense. ``Typically,'' Paddock says, ``if
you dig hard enough and scratch long enough, you will find how it
worked _ it helped minimize a patient's anxiety, or it helped him
feel more secure.''
</P>
<P>
   Paddock talks of a patient's ABC's _ his affect, behavior and
cognition. ``We learn these based on our life experiences, usually
in our family,'' he says. ``When a person comes to me with a
significant problem, it's my job to figure out why it makes sense
in his way of seeing the world. I try to help him block old
patterns and teach him new ones.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a catch, of course: People who are in therapy usually
want to be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people don't understand the limits of therapy,'' says
Dawes, whose book ``House of Cards'' is critical of the profession.
``Yes, it can work. But it doesn't necessarily make the world
right.''

 FLORIDA, THE No. 1 FOOTBALL STATE  
 (bl)  
 By MIC HUBER   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ Football is king in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   It has been that way at the high school and college levels for a
long time, but now professional football in Florida has rejoined
the royal family.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, the three pro teams that call the state home will
be playing conference semifinal games in the NFL playoffs. Two of
the three will be playing each other.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Dolphins take on the Jaguars at Jacksonville on
Saturday in a game scheduled to start at 12:35 p.m. The Tampa Bay
Buccaneers will host the Washington Redskins the same day, with the
kickoff set for 4:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   That's three teams from one state among the eight NFL
organizations still playing for a spot in Super Bowl XXXIV. There
are 31 teams in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about that the other day,'' said University of
South Florida coach Jim Leavitt, who is busy this week trying to
recruit high school talent for his college program. ``That's
amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   If the NFL is the destination, finding the high school players
with football potential is where the journey begins. And college
football is the path most taken.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need voodoo economics to understand how football
success is generated in Florida. It is called the trickle-up
effect.
</P>
<P>
   High schools supply the college programs in the state with
talent. NFL teams draft the best talent available, more often than
not from the best college programs. And that often means Florida
State University, the University of Florida and the University of
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's roster is dotted with players from Florida,
including stars Warren Sapp, Derrick Brooks, Brad Culpepper,
Warrick Dunn and Jacquez Green. Fred Taylor is the key to
Jacksonville's running game. The Dolphins wouldn't be here if not
for place-kicker Olindo Mare, who grew up in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   For years, high school football programs in Florida has been
regarded as among the best in the nation. Teams and individual
players, alike, have received national recognition.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that high schools have spring football and weight
training, the ability to be active outside year-round, and the
widespread popularity of football are among explanations for why so
many stars get their start in the Sunshine State.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Miami built college's dominant program of the
1980s by mining the gold coast for high school talent. Florida
State and Florida have been two of the most successful schools in
the 1990s on the football field by recruiting in high schools
throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   And there are more than enough players to go around. Almost
every major college football program east of the Mississippi has
followed the path to Florida in search of athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Buchalter, a respected recruiting analyst and writer for
the Orlando Sentinel, estimates that more than 800 players from
Florida play Division I football. The NCAA doesn't keep those types
of figures, but many believe that is a conservative number.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Coker, the offensive coordinator at the University of
Miami, said he has heard 150 athletes from Florida get Division I
scholarships in any one year.
</P>
<P>
   FSU won national titles in 1993 and this past season. Florida
won its national championship in 1996. And since 1991, FSU, Florida
or Miami has played in the game that determined the national
champion in every year but one.
</P>
<P>
   When a state school hasn't played for a national title, it often
is a player from Florida that has helped the team that did win it.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State is one of the many teams that has found success
by recruiting in Florida. There were 10 players on the roster of
the team that beat Florida in the Citrus Bowl, held in Orlando on
New Year's Day. Three of those players are from Sarasota.
</P>
<P>
   At the Sugar Bowl, both cornerbacks from Virginia Tech were from
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State head coach Bobby Williams pointed to the speed of
the Florida high school athlete as one reason teams search the
state. Spring training is a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get a Florida athlete, he is probably a little more
refined as a player when you get them out of high school,''
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spring football is important,'' agreed Coker. ``It gives kids
that much more work and exposure, and the opportunity to improve
and refine their skills.'' It's not unusual for players from
Florida to step in as true freshman and play important roles at
major college programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You grow up playing football in Florida,'' said Leavitt, who
started playing in fourth grade. ``It is ingrained in you. Football
is the No. 1 sport in Florida and kids want to be involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida universities reap the rewards of those high school
athletes. And it is those schools that are dominating college
football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning perpetuates winning,'' Coker said. ``If you win the
state championship, you have a good chance to be playing for the
national championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those same Florida athletes who led their college teams
to championship are now doing the same in professional football.
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the 27 players named to the All-Pro team, selected by
the Associated Press last weekend, played high school football in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive and defensive rookies of the year in the NFL _
Edgerrin James of Indianapolis and Jevon Kearse of Tennessee _ grew
up in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   At the pro level, Miami has seen championships in the past. The
Dolphins played in three straight Super Bowls in the 1970s, winning
twice. In winning the 1972 championship, Miami became the only team
in modern NFL history to finish the season with a perfect (17-0)
record.

`CITY OF ANGELS': MORAL LESSONS OF A NEW SERIES AT AN URBAN
HOSPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By RON WERTHEIMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have you ever noticed that when a review begins by praising
``the best of intentions,'' you can be pretty sure the other shoe
will drop within a couple of paragraphs?
</P>
<P>
   ``City of Angels,'' the new CBS drama series from Steven Bochco
and associates, must have been made with the best of intentions. In
portraying life in a gritty urban hospital, it transcends
television's usual narrow view of white American society, focusing
on a wide variety of black characters, from dedicated doctors and
sleazy administrators to ignorant street people. Its stories are
full of unambiguous lessons about overcoming prejudice. Its
production values are never less than first rate.
</P>
<P>
   But with its one-dimensional characters and relentless
preaching, it isn't compelling entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Clunk!
</P>
<P>
   The show, set in the down-at-the-heels Angels of Mercy Hospital
in Los Angeles, will be shown this Sunday night before moving into
its regular slot on Wednesdays. The series was created by Bochco
and two of his ``NYPD Blue'' colleagues, Paris Barclay, who
directed the premiere episode, and Nicholas Wootton, who wrote it
with Bochco. But viewers who expect to be pulled into the story by
the throat, as they are by the best ``NYPD'' episodes (glimpses of
heaven excepted) will be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's hour, you'll meet the essential players, starting
with Dr. Lillian Price (Vivica A. Fox), the hospital's naively
earnest new medical director, and Dr. Ben Turner (Blair Underwood),
its broodingly earnest acting chief of surgery. They nearly married
seven years earlier, and Lillian still carries a torch.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how these extremely attractive people talk. Upon meeting
the hospital's creep of a CEO, Ron Harris (Michael Warren), Lillian
says: ``I want to pick your brain about Angels of Mercy _ get a
heads up on how to proceed with my agenda.'' Upon learning that the
hospital's lone Jewish intern, the droopy Dr. Geoffrey Weiss (Phil
Buckman), feels the sting of unvarnished anti-Semitism from black
doctors and support staff, Ben says: ``This can be a frustrating
place for everybody. Just have to take it in stride.''
</P>
<P>
   The patients are mostly salt-of-the-earth types from the
neighborhood, merely symbols like the doctors. The one supporting
character with some hint of life is the hospital's off-kilter
chairman, Edwin O'Mally, played with scenery-chewing relish by
Robert Morse. His evil-eye, gap-tooth grin may not be a substitute
for fleshed-out characterization, but in the land of dripping
dignity, the evil-eyed man is king, or at least a welcome relief.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's show, a black intern, Dr. Wesley Williams (Hill
Harper) learns a valuable lesson. Thinking that the young man lying
in the emergency room with a bullet wound is a gang member, Wesley
sends another patient to surgery instead, telling an astonished
nurse that he wants to ``give my brother some time to reflect on
his lifestyle decisions.'' But he sure is contrite when he finds
out that the wounded man, whose life is ultimately saved by Ben on
the operating table, is another hospital doctor who was attacked on
his way home.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of that episode, Lillian is begging Ben to become the
full-fledged chief of surgery. But he hates being an administrator.
It takes him away from saving lives, you understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know in your heart you love Angels of Mercy,'' she says.
``Please. Be part of the solution.''
</P>
<P>
   He gives her a made-for-television smile and says, ``Nice try.''
Which also sums up the beginnings of ``City of Angels.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is a show you certainly want to encourage. So far, though,
it's not a show you want to watch.

OIL PIPELINE COMPANY FINED $30 MILLION FOR NEGLIGENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Kan., Texas, Okla., La., Mo. and Ala.) (rk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Koch Industries, an oil pipeline company, found the
weak points in its pipes the easy way, the government said
Thursday. It simply waited for the pipelines to break and spill
oil, part of a pattern of negligence that resulted Thursday in the
biggest civil fine levied to a company for environmental
violations.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency said that the company, based
in Wichita, Kan., had agreed to pay a $30 million penalty for more
than 300 separate spills of crude oil, gasoline and other oil
products between 1990 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said it had taken them months to put the case
together, partly because the company did business under many
different names, and even when it reported spills it sometimes
understated their volume by as much as 90 percent. Even after the
Justice Department brought the case, Koch refused to say what
pipelines it owned, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   To save money, the company did not inspect its pipelines for
corrosion, or pressure-test them, investigators said. ``It was
cheaper not to maintain them,'' said Steve Herman, the EPA's
assistant administrator for enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   And so, officials said, Koch just waited for the pipelines to
fail.
</P>
<P>
   The company leaked 3 million gallons of crude oil and other
substances into ponds, lakes and rivers in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas,
Louisiana, Missouri and Alabama, according to Carol Browner, the
administrator of the EPA, in announcing the settlement. The
settlement was filed in U.S. District Court in Houston Thursday to
settle charges brought by the government between 1995 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the spills killed thousands of fish and
birds. In Kansas, a spill forced the partial shutdown of a
municipal water system.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the settlement, the company will also pay $5 million
to buy environmentally sensitive land and protect it from
development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's landmark fine against Koch Industries for egregious
violations of the Clean Water Act sends a strong message that those
who try to profit by polluting our environment pay a price,'' Ms.
Browner said.
</P>
<P>
   The company offered a totally different interpretation,
asserting through a high executive that Koch had reduced its
pipeline leaks by 90 percent in the last decade. When leaks do
occur, Koch is committed ``to clean them up quickly and
completely,'' said Pat McCann, a senior vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the settlement is fair and reasonable and will
avoid even more years of litigation,'' McCann said.
</P>
<P>
   While the fine announced Thursday was the largest civil penalty
of its kind, it was dwarfed by the $125 million criminal penalty
paid by Exxon for the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `ANGELA'S ASHES,' starring Emily Watson, Robert Carlyle, Joe
Breen, Ciaran Owens and Michael Legge. Directed by Alan Parker (R,
120 minutes). Anyone who thinks poverty is not pretty would have to
think twice after seeing this artfully desolate-looking film
version of Frank McCourt's boyhood memoir. The movie describes dire
suffering alongside inspiring, uplifting episodes. Directed
reverently by Parker, it parades forth a series of familiar
anecdotes from McCourt's book without taking on much weight. This
is the kind of film about hardship in which nobody has indoor
plumbing, but everybody has clean hair (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``ANNA AND THE KING,'' starring Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat.
Directed by Andy Tennant (PG-13, 140 minutes). The same story that
inspired the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical ``The King and I'' is
the basis for this movie about the British schoolteacher Anna
Leonowens (Ms. Foster), who travels to Bangkok in 1862 to educate
the 58 children of King Mongkut (Chow). Although the story has been
given a contemporary multicultural perspective that is critical of
British imperialism, the picturesque film tells essentially the
same story but without the beloved songs, which are badly missed.
Ms. Foster's Anna is another of her nobler-than-thou ice queens,
and Chow's king is authoritative but less than thunderous (Stephen
Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `ANY GIVEN SUNDAY,' starring Al Pacino, Cameron Diaz, Dennis
Quaid, James Woods and Jamie Foxx. Directed by Oliver Stone (R, 160
minutes). Stone's brawling, hypermacho professional football film
has enough in-the-thick-of-it playing-field action to satisfy the
fantasies of most armchair players. In the style of Stone's ``Wall
Street,'' the movie is also a crude morality play that pits the old
ways against the new with the veteran coach Tony D'Amato (Pacino)
embodying tradition and a young hotshot quarterback, Willie Beamen
(Foxx), the new. Although the acting is uneven (Ms. Diaz is
disappointing as a tough team owner), and the final scenes are
shamelessly ``Rocky''-ish, the movie delivers a credible,
action-charged vision of the frenzied world of professional sports
as a metaphor for the volatility of American culture (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `BICENTENNIAL MAN,' starring Robin Williams, Embeth Davidtz, Sam
Neill and Oliver Platt. Directed by Chris Columbus (PG, 132
minutes). This gushy Robin Williams star vehicle follows the
200-year quest of a household robot named Andrew to become human.
Directed by the schmaltzmeister Chris Columbus, who steered this
star through ``Mrs. Doubtfire,'' the movie is a joke-strewn,
sentimental man-machine allegory determined to make us feel good
about being human. Corny speeches exalting freedom, the joys of sex
and the mystery of mortality punctuate the tale. Except for
Williams, the acting is strictly of sitcom caliber (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `BOYS DON'T CRY,' starring Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny.
Directed by Kimberly Peirce (R, 114 minutes). This stunning debut
feature tells the strange and resonant story of Brandon Teena, who
despite being born Teena Brandon went on to create a charismatic
identity as a young man. Brandon's ultimately wrenching tale may
sound tabloid-ready, but on screen it turns into Theodore Dreiser's
idea of American tragedy. The film makes it hauntingly real and
even tenderly romantic, with the astonishing acting needed to make
it work. One of last year's best (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE CIDER HOUSE RULES,' starring Tobey Maguire, Charlize Theron
and Delroy Lindo. Directed by Lasse Hallstrom (PG-13, 125 minutes).
Radically downsized in scope, and its examination of the issue of
abortion greatly softened, John Irving's sixth novel (with a
Dickensian screenplay by the author) has been turned into a lovely
World War II-era fable about a young man venturing out into the
world. Maguire is Homer Wells, a doleful innocent raised in an
orphanage by Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine), who performs
abortions. Fleeing the institution with a golden young couple (Ms.
Theron and Paul Rudd), he becomes an apple picker. Sentimental but
smart, the movie has the sweetness and narrative drive of a 1940s
``David Copperfield'' (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `CRADLE WILL ROCK,' starring Emily Watson, John Turturro, Ruben
Blades, John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Bill Murray and Vanessa Redgrave.
Written and directed by Tim Robbins (R, 132 minutes). This huge
Depression-era story features well-known figures from Orson Welles
to Nelson Rockefeller to Diego Rivera, and it works them into an
ambitious ``Ragtime''-like tableau. Though too many figures in this
landscape are reduced to naive caricature, Robbins and his
impressive cast bring strong passions to bear upon this (mostly)
true story of a legendary event: the trouble-fraught production, by
Welles and John Houseman, of the banner-waving 1936 agitprop
musical ``The Cradle Will Rock.'' Robbins and his cast play out all
sides of this event with the certitude that its importance lives on
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE END OF THE AFFAIR,' starring Ralph Fiennes, Julianne Moore,
Stephen Rea and Ian Hart. Directed by Neil Jordan (R, 105 minutes).
Jordan's intoxicating version of Graham Greene's 1951 novel, in
which an illicit affair becomes a far greater gamble than either
lover could have imagined. For this fearlessly eclectic filmmaker,
this is one more intelligent, brooding love story with a secret
twist. Fiennes and Ms. Moore breathe life into it with a dreamy,
erotic intensity that in no way trivializes the film's underlying
ideas about religious faith. Period detail (the setting is London
in the mid-1940s) is sumptuously heightened by the inspired costume
designer Sandy Powell (``Shakespeare in Love'') (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   `GALAXY QUEST,' starring Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver and Alan
Rickman. Directed by Dean Parisot (PG, 102 minutes). Whether you
love ``Star Trek'' or laugh at it, your starship has come in,
docking in the form of this amiable comedy that simultaneously
manages to spoof these popular futuristic space adventures and
replicate the very elements that have made them so durable. The
film spins out of a single joke, about a bunch of washed-up actors
from a canceled television series who are enlisted by some
credulous interplanetary simpletons to champion them in a conflict
with a scaly, bellicose villain who has all but exterminated their
people. And soon they are off on a genuine space adventure. If
``Galaxy Quest'' never attains consistently giddy heights as it
plays out its combination of knowing satire and heroic adventure,
it keeps its tongue firmly in its cheek, offers a few genuine
laughs, moves swiftly if not at warp speed, and is led by a
talented cast (Lawrence Van Gelder).
</P>
<P>
   `GIRL, INTERRUPTED,' starring Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie.
Directed by James Mangold (R, 120 minutes). Except for being
several years too old for the role, Winona Ryder, an actress who
oozes high-strung intelligence, is ideally cast as Susanna Kaysen,
a pre-college-age girl who lands in a Cambridge mental institution
in 1967 after a halfhearted suicide attempt. (The movie is based on
Ms. Kaysen's memoir.) The period details are perfect, and Ms. Ryder
has the courage to make her character a pain in the neck. But the
small, introspective movie is nearly stolen by Ms. Jolie as a
charismatic, brutally truth-telling sociopath who becomes Susanna's
best friend (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `THE GREEN MILE,' starring Tom Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan,
David Morse, Doug Hutchison, Sam Rockwell and Bonnie Hunt. Written
and directed by Frank Darabont (R, 180 minutes). In adapting the
death row drama that Stephen King wrote in multiple installments,
the director of ``The Shawshank Redemption'' could have managed
more economy and fewer talky bits of business around the cellblock.
Still, this lengthy film is vivid and well played. Smooth ensemble
acting builds up to the discovery that a gigantic condemned man
(Duncan) is a prisoner with very special abilities, which gives the
film its mixture of religious overtones and mild horror. Hanks, as
a wry Southern prison guard, is so unaffectedly good that it's
redundant to say so (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE HURRICANE,' starring Denzel Washington. Directed by Norman
Jewison (R, 120 minutes). The life story of Rubin ``Hurricane''
Carter, a middleweight contender who spent nearly 20 years in
prison for a triple murder he didn't commit, is a big, schmaltzy
ballad of a movie redeemed by Washington's moving, bone-deep
portrayal of the boxer from Paterson, N.J. But the movie plays fast
and loose with the facts, giving far too much credit to the members
of a Canadian commune who took up Carter's cause and all but
eliminating his heroic co-defendant John Artis from the story. And
the minor characters are either saints or monsters. Yet the story
of a man heroically fighting his demons and winning his freedom is
still inspiring (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `THE INSIDER,' starring Al Pacino, Russell Crowe and Christopher
Plummer. Directed by Michael Mann (R, 155 minutes). Mann directs
this taut thriller about the tobacco industry whistle-blower
Jeffrey Wigand with pulse-quickening panache. And he illustrates
why, in the corporate climate of the '90s, truth-telling is a
riskier business than it was circa ``All the President's Men.''
While Pacino delivers galvanizing moral outrage as a producer for
``60 Minutes,'' and Plummer wickedly mimics Mike Wallace, Crowe
movingly captures the complexity of Wigand's situation. Shaky
docudrama ethics cloud the film's take on ``60 Minutes.'' But this
is an inordinately well-played thriller, with Mann's stylistic brio
at its best (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `MAGNOLIA,' starring Tom Cruise, Melinda Dillon, Philip Seymour
Hoffman, William H. Macy, Julianne Moore, John C. Reilly and Jason
Robards. Written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson (R, 180
minutes). In ``Magnolia'' the colossally talented Anderson has set
up an artfully orchestrated symphony of intersecting L.A. stories,
with many of the cast members from his ``Boogie Nights'' assembled
to form a charismatic ensemble. The movie is saved from its own
worst ideas by the intimacy of the performances. Its single biggest
surprise is Tom Cruise in the role of a strutting,
obscenity-spouting cult figure named Frank Mackey (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `MAN ON THE MOON,' starring Jim Carrey, Courtney Love, Danny
DeVito and Paul Giamatti. Directed by Milos Forman (R, 118
minutes). Andy Kaufman: genius or creep? This biography takes the
more positive view and minimizes the kinkier aspects of Kaufman's
misanthropic performance art, preferring a big, vibrant collection
of greatest hits. Carrey channels his character brilliantly and
makes his material funnier and tighter than it was in fact. And
Forman directs with the same enthusiasm for outlaw Americana that
he brought to ``The People vs. Larry Flynt.'' But the writers, who
also wrote that film and ``Ed Wood,'' can't easily find an
unself-conscious side of the late comic artist to work with. This
feels like the authorized version. It has no real answer to the
question of who Kaufman was and how he got that way (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `ONEGIN,' starring Ralph Fiennes, Liv Tyler and Martin Donovan.
Directed by Martha Fiennes (not rated, 106 minutes). As the
directorial debut of Ralph Fiennes' sister Martha, ``Onegin''
diminishes Pushkin's epic 19th-century novel ``Eugene Onegin'' into
a cramped little soap opera whose two stars are painfully
mismatched. While Fiennes acts up a fine storm as the arrogant,
cynical title character who doesn't believe in love, Ms. Tyler, who
plays his romantic nemesis, is an inert cipher. Somehow, even the
grand ballrooms of 1820s St. Petersburg look drab and chintzy
(Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS,' starring Ethan Hawke, James Cromwell
and Max Von Sydow. Directed by Scott Hicks (PG-13, 130 minutes).
This director's follow-up to ``Shine'' is the cinematic equivalent
of an arty coffee-table book. It is so busy illustrating the story
(with elaborate flashbacks and montage sequences) that it forgets
to be dramatic. Set in the Pacific Northwest in 1950, the movie
looks back to World War II and the charged relationships between
Japanese-Americans and whites on an island north of the Puget
Sound. Hawke is the brooding reporter covering the trial and Von
Sydow the defense lawyer who is the film's official conscience.
Robert Richardson is responsible for the gorgeous cinematography
(Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `STUART LITTLE,' starring Geena Davis, Hugh Laurie and Jonathan
Lipnicki. Directed by Rob Minkoff (PG, 92 minutes). E.B. White's
1945 children's classic has been adapted into a lovely family film
about a little mouse (with the voice of Michael J. Fox) who is
adopted by humans but runs afoul of their fluffy white Persian cat,
Snowbell (Nathan Lane). The movie creates an enchanted storybook
version of New York and has what may be the most exciting toy boat
race (in Central Park) ever filmed. Thanks to Lane's sly, wise-guy
vocal impersonation, Snowbell nearly steals a movie that is funny
and sweet but never cloying (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `SWEET AND LOWDOWN,' starring Sean Penn, Samantha Morton and Uma
Thurman. Directed by Woody Allen (PG-13, 95 minutes). In homage to
the kind of jaunty 1930s jazz that has been heard on many of his
other films' soundtracks, Allen imagines a consummate jazz
character: Emmet Ray (played with gusto by Penn), who can play the
guitar as gorgeously as Django Reinhardt but lacks certain
interpersonal skills when it comes to his private life. Borrowing
attributes of various real musicians, the film turns Emmet into
another one of Allen's cad-geniuses and gives him a long-suffering
mute laundress as a sweetheart. (Ms. Morton works miracles in her
wordless role.) But on the storytelling level, the film remains
flimsy. It's the musical interludes, frequent and lovingly
presented, that keep it alive (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY,' starring Matt Damon, Jude Law,
Gwyneth Paltrow, Cate Blanchett and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Written
and directed by Anthony Minghella (R, 135 minutes). There are
diabolically smart surprises wherever you care to look in this
glittering thriller. Proving that the brilliance of ``The English
Patient'' was no fluke, Minghella shapes a hypnotic, sensually
charged adaptation of Patricia High-smith's fascinatingly reptilian
murder story. The traffic-stopping cast includes Damon as the
dangerous chameleon of the title and, in a star-making role, the
English actor Jude Law as a rich dilettante who exerts a homoerotic
magnetism. Ms. Paltrow plays the odd woman out with the shrewdness
of a fine character actress, while Ms. Blanchett makes the
delirious most of her role as a needy American post-debutante. As
the story's odious playboy-snob, Hoffman is scene-stealingly
wonderful. Gorgeously photographed in Italy by John Seale (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TITUS,' starring Anthony Hopkins, Jessica Lange, Alan Cumming,
Harry Lennix and Jonathan Rhys Meyers. Directed by Julie Taymor (R,
160 minutes). Ms. Taymor, the theater director and puppeteer who
created transfixing stage pictures in ``The Lion King'' and ``Juan
Darien,'' has turned Shakespeare's goriest tragedy, ``Titus
Andronicus,'' into a powerful contemplation of murderous revenge
enacted throughout history. Hopkins is ghoulishly funny and tragic
as the title character, whose political stupidity sets in motion a
devastating chain reaction of killing, torture and retaliation. Ms.
Lange is Tamora, the captured Goth empress who strikes back.
Although the movie's British theatrical and American film acting
styles don't mesh, Ms. Taymor's vision is realized with a
shattering force in time-traveling imagery that blends ancient Rome
with Mussolini's Italy and contemporary cyberpunk flash (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `TOPSY-TURVY,' starring Allan Corduner and Jim Broadbent.
Directed by Mike Leigh (R, 161 minutes). Leigh's grandly
entertaining ``Topsy-Turvy'' is one of those films that create a
mix of erudition, pageantry and delectable acting opportunities,
much as ``Shakespeare in Love'' did last year. Instead of a
love-struck young playwright, it presents the curiously matched
personalities of the librettist William Schwenk Gilbert and the
composer Arthur Sullivan in the midst of a robust, knowing,
frequently hilarious look at the musical theater over which they
held sway (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TOY STORY 2,' with the voices of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen.
Directed by John Lasseter; a Pixar Animated Studios film (G, 98
minutes). A wonderfully playful sequel, sustaining the first film's
wit and novelty while bringing new sophistication to
computer-generated animation. And here is welcome proof that
Hollywood can still make movies to please audiences of any age or
persuasion. From its opening (a perfectly adorable ``Star Wars''
parody) to its Capra-esque conclusion, this is a seamless work with
more metaphorical cleverness than that usually found in the toy
bin. Colorful new characters and more adventurous action enhance
the story of how Woody falls into the clutches of a sleazy toy
dealer, experiences new-found celebrity and needs to be rescued by
his fabulous old friends (Maslin).

   MEDICARE-DRUGS (Washington) _ Developments in the long-running
debate on the prices paid for prescription drugs by Medicare
recipients. By Robert Pear.
</P>
<P>
   MICH-BOY-SENTENCED (Pontiac, Mich.) _ In an unexpected verdict,
a state judge ruled here Thursday that the youngest American ever
charged and convicted as an adult of murder will serve a seven-year
sentence at a maximum-security juvenile detention center and then
be released. The judge, rejecting prosecutors' requests that the
boy be sentenced to additional time in an adult prison after
serving time in juvenile detention, rebuked a system that he said
had gone too far in punishing juveniles. His sentencing also bucked
a trend in which, increasingly, juveniles charged with violent
crimes have been sentenced as adults. By Keith Bradsher.
</P>
<P>
   TV-DRUGS-SCRIPTS (Undated) _ The White House drug office has
secretly been pushing TV networks for scripts with anti-drug
messages, and for at least a year has been helping edit the scripts
on selected shows. The White House provided millions of dollars of
financial incentives to networks to make sure the scripts were on
message. By Marc Lacey and Bill Carter.

<P>
   SAHARA-VILLAGE (Araouane, Mali) _ The sand woman came out of the
blackness of the village master's house into the desert light,
bearing a bowl of sand her hands had scooped from the doorway and
would deposit several feet away. It is a lifetime's work, this
struggle against the sand, for Souda Cissey and Araouane's other
sand women, a daily contest to prevent the Sahara from burying,
once and for all, this ancient village in West Africa. The world's
largest desert has already taken away a mosque and countless houses
in recent years, the rooftops of some still visible on the sand's
surface, others fallen into the Sahara's bottomless pits. The women
clear courtyards and doorways from dawn to dusk in Araouane, the
once fabled oasis six days by camel north of Timbuktu, the city at
the desert's edge. By Norimitsu Onishi.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA (Argun) _ The Russian military insists it has
taken back this Chechen town. But on Thursday Russian soldiers
nervously scanned the rooftops and windows of Argun's battered
buildings as they sought to keep order. ``There are snipers
around,'' a Russian officer called out. ``Take care.'' Set in the
Chechen lowlands, Argun was taken by the Russian military in early
December. Today, however, it has become a salient example of how
hard it may be for Russia to take Chechnya and keep it. All across
Chechnya, Russian troops tried to tighten their grip over the swath
of territory ``liberated'' by Russian forces. By Michael R. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-OLD-BLACKHOLES (Atlanta) _ In a discovery that could help
explain the origin of the earliest galaxies, a new astronomy
satellite has detected the first discreet objects in a mysterious
glow of X-rays that pervades the distant universe. Some of the
faintest of the radiation sources, astronomers said, could be the
most distant objects ever observed. They promise to be important
clues to conditions in the cosmic dark age, the period after the
creation of the universe that began with the big bang and before
the emergence of stars that gave light to the firmament. By John
Noble Wilford.

BUSH-ADS (Undated) - Choosing Arizona for his experimental canvas,
Texas Gov. George W. Bush plans to air the first ever
Spanish-language television ads in a Republican primary, and
Arizona Sen. John McCain, trying to hold his own against Bush, will
likely also put up ads, aides to both campaigns said. The
television ads could be particularly influential in Arizona because
the candidates are spending most of their time campaigning
elsewhere, and the TV spots are likely all that voters will see of
them. As of today, no campaign swings through Arizona are planned
by any presidential candidate until February. By KRIS MAYES. Story

 &QL; 
TEACHERPAY (Phoenix) - The disparity between teacher pay and other
professional salaries continues to grow, according to the latest
report on the topic. In Arizona, for example, teachers with a
bachelor's degree make $28,106, compared to $43,051 for all other
career folks with the same level of education. Arizona ranks 34th
when it comes to teacher pay, which is one notch higher than last
year. All of this makes headlines as the teacher shortage kicks
into high gear. We talk to teachers and find out what school
districts are trying to do to lure educators, including signing
bonuses in some states. By KELLY PEARCE. Story will move in the

ASUSAT1 (Tempe, Ariz.) - The world's first space launch of the

CHOUINARD (Phoenix) - When a hysterical Erica Chouinard, wife of
Diamondbacks relief pitcher Bobby Chouinard, dialed 911 on

last year in Arizona to report domestic violence. Like Chouinard,
23,000 people - mostly men - were arrested. The Maricopa County
Attorney's Office prosecuted more than 2,000 cases last year. There
are no statistics to show how they were resolved in court, but a
sampling of similar cases shows that many defendants went to
prison. By VICTORIA HARKER. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL;

 &HT;    LATIN POP STAR, WANTED ON CHILD-CORRUPTION CHARGES, CAPTURED IN
BRAZIL
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In an act that rivaled Madonna, she spanked her
male fans with belts, held a microphone to her crotch and ridiculed
Mexican politics.
</P>
<P>
   And since she became a fugitive more than a year ago, famous
Mexican pop singer Gloria Trevi has been sighted more often than
Elvis.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Trevi finally surfaced for real after Brazilian
police arrested her and her manager on charges in their native
Mexico that they had lured young girls into Trevi's act and abused
them as virtual sex slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Trevi and her manager, Sergio Andrade, were detained by police
in an exclusive neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro Thursday morning,
according to the office of Mexico's Attorney General. The pair was
on a list of fugitives from the law maintained by Interpol, the
international police force.
</P>
<P>
   Trevi rose to fame throughout Latin America, Spain and in
Spanish-speaking parts of the United States in the late 1980s and
early 1990s. Originally from an upper-class family in Monterrey, an
industrial city in northern Mexico, Trevi crafted a sexy,
rebellious image and sang songs in a raspy voice that challenged
men, parents and authority in general.
</P>
<P>
   She became known as Mexico's Madonna because of her skimpy stage
outfits and her twin image as a sex object and feminist fed up with
male domination.
</P>
<P>
   She often posed nearly nude for calendars and posters and amused
fans with her theatrical claims she would one day run for
president.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans have been mesmerized by Trevi's fall from extravagant
pop star to fugitive on the run. On Thursday television stations
breathlessly reported details of the arrest and replayed tapes of
Trevi prancing on stage in torn clothing, tossing her trademark
mane of reddish-brown hair and rubbing Coca Cola over her body.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying I'm the best daughter in the world. I'm not
saying I'm the best Catholic in the world,'' Trevi said in an old
taped interview, clearly relishing her reputation as a successful
rebel. ``But I love my parents and I worship God.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican authorities are charging Trevi, 30, and her manager,
Sergio Andrade, 44, with corrupting minors by encouraging them to
join a ``school'' and promising to train them to become singers and
dancers in Trevi's group.
</P>
<P>
   The family of one girl, 17-year-old Karina Yapor, told
authorities their daughter was instead sexually abused by Andrade
and forced to work as a prostitute in addition to singing in
Trevi's chorus. They said the girl was 12 when she signed up to
join Trevi and Andrade, who managed and produced Trevi's music.
After Yapor joined the group, her parents said, she severed contact
with her family.
</P>
<P>
   Yapor's parents found out last year that she had been living in
Spain for a time and had given birth to a son. The child has been
turned over to Yapor's parents in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Yapor returned to Mexico in December and tearfully offered
interviews contradicting her parents, saying Andrade was not the
father of her son and that he had never raped her. She said she was
never held against her will.
</P>
<P>
   Andrade's ex-wife, who was also a member of the troupe, and
another girl, tell a different story, however. They claim that they
and other women were virtual prisoners and that Trevi regularly
procured girls for Andrade's pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-wife, Aline Hernandez, wrote a book about the alleged
scandal that captured headlines. Trevi and Andrade both denied they
had committed any abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Andrade owns a home in McAllen, Texas, where it was rumored that
he and Trevi were in hiding at one point. They were also reportedly
spotted in various parts of Mexico and South America. The Mexican
Attorney General's office says it has information confirming that
Trevi and Andrade had traveled through Argentina and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico enlisted the help of Interpol, the international police
force, to track down Trevi and Andrade.
</P>
<P>
   Arrested with the pair on Thursday was Maria Raquenel, a singer
in Trevi's band, ``Boquitas Pintadas,'' or ``Little Painted
Mouths.''

PRINCE PHILIP CUTS OFF HARRODS CONTRACT 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By WARREN HOGE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Buckingham Palace announced on Thursday that it was
withdrawing the royal warrant awarded by Prince Philip, the Duke of
Edinburgh, to Harrods, the London department store that is owned by
Mohamed Al Fayed.
</P>
<P>
   A palace spokesman said the decision was based on a falloff in
business from the duke, who originally granted his endorsement in
1956. ``The warrant will not be renewed because of the significant
decline in the trading relationship between the household and
Harrods over several years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He made no reference to the fact that six weeks ago Al Fayed
called the prince a Nazi sympathizer and accused him of
masterminding a plot with the British security services that
resulted in the 1997 Paris car crash that killed Diana, Princess of
Wales, and her companion, Al Fayed's son.
</P>
<P>
   The Harrods owner had made those allegations in responding to an
unsuccessful libel suit brought against him by a disgraced
Conservative former member of Parliament _ and in court Al Fayed
challenged Prince Philip to sue him if the allegations were untrue.
It appeared on Thursday that the prince had come up with a less
litigious response.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second royal snub of Harrods in the last month. In
December, the queen switched her annual order of 1,500 Christmas
puddings for the palace staff from the famous department store to
Tesco, a leading supermarket chain.
</P>
<P>
   Al Fayed, 66, is an Egyptian-born businessman who has lived here
for more than three decades and who has conducted a noisy public
campaign since 1994 to persuade Britain to grant him citizenship.
Over the last two years, he has become a particular irritant to the
royal family by persistently theorizing that the Paris crash was a
conspiracy planned by British secret security forces to satisfy
royal objections to a possible marriage between Diana and Al
Fayed's son, Dodi Fayed.
</P>
<P>
   Al Fayed had no public reaction on Thursday, but his spokesman,
Laurie Mayer, said: ``We feel the commercial impact on Harrods
would be negligible. The cachet of royals shopping at Harrods no
longer has the same impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrods now has a year to remove the royal arms from its
stationery, goods, offices and delivery vehicles. Governed by
strict regulations, the warrant enables holders to use the legend
``By appointment'' and to display the royal symbols on its
products.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's Peerage,
said the loss of the warrant would hurt Harrods because of what it
signified for the foreign tourists who have a particular reverence
for things royal. Harrods gives its warrant high visibility, with
blown-up full color replicas installed outside its illuminated
Knightsbridge building that can be seen from many blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effect that has on people coming from Europe and the
Americas, for example, as well as this country cannot be
underestimated,'' Brooks-Baker said. ``It adds very significantly
to the value of the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrods received its first royal warrant in 1913 from Queen Mary
and is one of the few stores in Britain to have them from all four
royal personages with the power to grant them: the queen, the Duke
of Edinburgh, Prince Charles and the Queen Mother.
</P>
<P>
   Al Fayed might have reason to stay in touch with the palace
staff requiring him to dismantle the ducal warrants. The warrants
from the queen and Prince Charles come up for renewal next year.
</P>
<P>
   Formal recognition of tradesmen who supplied the monarch began
in the middle ages, but it was during Queen Victoria's reign that
the practice of granting royal warrants became established.
</P>
<P>
   There are some 1,100 active warrants, with 20 to 30 new ones
approved and a similar number dropped each year. They have
historically been given to people who became the royal merchant of
choice for such things as coach whips, dog food, cherry brandy,

<P>
   A Glasgow company is in charge of the bagpipes that greet the
queen when she goes to Scotland, a Lancashire haberdasher makes the
Buckingham Palace chefs' clothes and an Aberdeenshire expert in
stuffing animals and mounting skins is the monarachy's favored
taxidermist.

<P>
   Records unearthed by The Press Association, Britain's domestic
news agency, show that during the 18th and 19th centuries, royal
warrants included a pinmaker, rat catcher and mole-taker. A man
named Thomas Hewytt was once called upon to ``Serve the Court with
Swannes and Cranes and all finds of Wildfoule.''
</P>
<P>
   The royal cold shoulder may one day nudge furious new statements
against the palace from Al Fayed, but what it brought forth on
Thursday from his spokesman, Mayer, sounded more like something
delivered with a stiff upper lip. ``The Duke of Edinburgh,'' he
said, `` is perfectly entitled to shop wherever he likes.''

 &HT;    Palliser's `Unburied' a rewarding tale of betrayal
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Charles Palliser's bewitching ``The
Unburied'' begins just after World War I. A man journeys to Geneva
to confront an elderly woman about a recently published book. The
book is a mixture of correct information and incorrect suppositions
about a famous series of medieval murders in the English town of
Thurchester.
</P>
<P>
   The narrator knows the book's suppositions are false because he
has recently come into possession of the Courtine manuscript, which
lays bare the truth of the murders that were echoed nearly 400
years later in a sad story of human duplicity and the persistence
of evil.
</P>
<P>
   The old woman is soon to die and knows it, but gives away
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   We flash back 50 years to the story of the studious,
determinedly unworldly academic Dr. Courtine, as he arrives in
Thurchester to visit Austin, an old college chum from whom he has
been estranged for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   While in Thurchester, where the murders took place in the
cathedral, death strikes yet again, in the apparently
incomprehensible fashion beloved of those with a taste for
locked-room mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   The new murders aren't that difficult to unravel _ any mystery
aficionado knows to prepare himself for a variation of the old
shell game when a corpse has to be identified by his clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, ``The Unburied'' remains a delight because of an
intricacy that never becomes confusing, and for the perfect ear
Palliser has for Victorian life and its ornate, attractive speech
rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   In inexpert hands, this can be a bit like an oatmeal bath, but
unlike many of the writers Palliser is channeling, he keeps the
plot moving and the atmosphere atmospheric:
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat in the vast, gloomy dining room in which there were no
other diners, served by a lugubrious waiter with the mournful
solemnity of the last priest of a dying church. The ambience seemed
all of a piece with this ancient, decaying town withs its unlit and
dilapidated streets in which nobody ever seemed to be about.''
</P>
<P>
   He's after a tricky melding here. There are all sorts of hints
of other writers, from the unavoidable echoes of Trollope, provided
by the author's surname, to the Jamesian tenor of the prologue, to
the retrieval of a great, buried Victorian story that is the
novel's centerpiece, which recalls A.S. Byatt's ``Possession.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the shifting time frames _ present day, i.,e.
1919, while the Courtine manuscript, which occupies the bulk of the
book, involves the deep Victorian era as well as solving the
original medieval murders.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the plot, the novel is about the getting of wisdom, for
the initially unsympathetic and blundering Courtine has his own
fears and demons that the narrative helps him solve.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who invite betrayal,'' a character tells
Courtine in a highly charged, brief encounter towards the book's
end. ``They are demanding towards themselves and don't realize how
hard they are on other people. They make it difficult for others
not to fail them. And in some cases they take a grim pleasure from
being let down.''
</P>
<P>
   The novel is less about its title _ although one aged corpse
does turn up in Thurchester Cathedral _ than it is about the
various permutations of betrayal, and how different people react to
it.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, ``The Unburied'' explains all of the mysteries of
Thurchester, as well as some of the more complex aspects of human
nature. It's a delicious book, a perfect companion for the
proverbial dark and stormy night.

VOTERS WANT TO KNOW: DID HILLARY CHEAT? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (p and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ So it comes down to that familiar question: What did
Hillary Rodham Clinton know and when did she know it?
</P>
<P>
   The mystery this time isn't about Whitewater, Travelgate, or
cattle futures. It's about the quiz she took Wednesday night on
``The Late Show with David Letterman.''
</P>
<P>
   In the course of a wildly successful appearance _ she laughed,
cracked jokes, seemed relaxed, and in short, did everything a
politician needs to do on a late-night television talk-show _
Clinton aced a quiz from Letterman to gauge her knowledge of New
York arcana.
</P>
<P>
   A major point working against the first lady in her campaign to
become New York's junior senator is the ``carpetbagger issue'' _
the fact that she has never lived here before. As Letterman perhaps
only half-jokingly put it before giving her the quiz, her score
``could make or break the entire campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton scored a perfect five out of five. But now, it turns
out, she was given _ as her campaign spokesman, Howard Wolfson,
acknowledged _ ``a peek'' at the questions ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson insists she was not given the answers. But, in this age
of cellular phones and Internet fact-books, is this distinction
much more than a semantic one?
</P>
<P>
   The issue hardly amounts to Watergate. It's not even close to
Charles Van Doren and the ``$64,000 Question'' fraud. Still, the
question remains: Did Hillary cheat?
</P>
<P>
   Rob Burnett, Letterman's executive producer, laughed when the
subject was brought up in a phone interview Thursday. ``Asking me
this question,'' he said, ``is like asking the World Wrestling
Federation, `Do you fake blood?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' he continued, ``we are not `Meet the Press' over
here. All we're trying to do is get a few laughs.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Burnett dutifully retraced the chronology. ``The idea of
the quiz was Dave's idea. It came up very late in the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not know there would be a quiz, both Burnett and
Wolfson said, until she entered the Ed Sullivan Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 15 minutes before air, we let her know that we would
give her a quiz about New York,'' Burnett said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither he nor Wolfson would delve into how close a ``peek''
Clinton had of the questions. However, they both insisted she knew
the answers on her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding is that, because of the obvious circumstances
_ accused of being an `outsider' and all that _ she's extremely
well-briefed,'' said Burnett.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as one of Clinton's aides, who asked not to be identified,
put it, ``We've long assumed, at some point, someone would ask her
what the state bird is.''
</P>
<P>
   Letterman's tested Clinton on New York's state bird (the
bluebird), tree (sugar maple), highest mountain range
(Adirondacks), Great Lakes borders (Ontario and Erie), number of
counties (62), and, finally, the New Yorker known with equal
measures of fear and reverence as ``The Big Guy'' (why, David
Letterman, of course).
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Clinton's likely
Republican opponent in the Senate race, did not return phone calls
Thursday for comments on Clinton's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Her appearance certainly had good results for everyone else
involved. Overnight reports indicate the program earned a 9.0
rating and a 20 share in the New York City area _ three times as
many viewers as Letterman lures on average. Nationwide, figures
were only slightly lower _ an 8.6 rating, about 2 1/2 times more
than its usual rating and nearly double Jay Leno's draw on NBC's
``Tonight Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnett said Clinton agreed, after the show, to come back
sometime for another appearance. Giuliani, who has been on the
program 16 times since 1994, will no doubt come on again, too,
Burnett added, though no date has been set.

   JACKIE-SUSANN-FILM (Undated) _ Before she started writing
fiction, ``Valley of the Dolls''; ``The Love Machine'' and ``Once
Is Not Enough,'' Jackie Susann spent the better part of three
decades trying to be a star before she died at 56, so it would no
doubt delight her that she's the subject of ``Isn't She Great,'' a
near-slapstick comedy with a melancholy undertow written by Paul
Rudnick and directed by Andrew Bergman. Loosely based on ``Wasn't
She Great?,'' a 1995 New Yorker article by Michael Korda, who
edited ``The Love Machine,'' the film opens Jan. 28 and stars Bette
Midler as Susann. By Karen Durbin. (Moved). &QL;

<P>
   JAMES-TOBACK-FILMS (New York) _ Few film directors can boast a
career like James Toback's. Fewer still might want to. Half a dozen
movies that have not always rubbed critics the right way, or
translated into huge box office profits (or losses, for that
matter). And yet, at 55, this idiosyncratic writer-director still
makes the movies he wants to, lures marquee stars, finds the money
men and, lately, makes the cut at the big film festivals. By Rick
Marin. (Moved). Photo. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NINTH-GATE-FILM (Rome) _ Seated at a corner table at Il
Matriciano, one of his favorite haunts during the dolce vita of the
'70s, Roman Polanski was discussing his desire to make an
important, lasting film. Almost impatiently, he explained that his
latest release, ``The Ninth Gate,'' was not it. ```Ninth Gate' is
fun, it's nice, I think it's a good movie, but after all, what is
it about?'' asked Polanski, 66, the Polish-born director whose
repertory includes ``Repulsion,'' ``Rosemary's Baby'' and
``Chinatown.'' ``It's like every other movie that is made nowadays.
It may be different in style, but it doesn't make any important
statement.'' Actually, ``The Ninth Gate,'' is an occult thriller
opening March 31 that features satanic rituals, exotic locales and
gruesome deaths, and stars Johnny Depp. By Alessandra Stanley.

</P>
<P>
   BEAUTIFUL-PEOPLE-FILM (London) _ ``Beautiful People,'' is Jasmin
Dizdar's first feature film, which opens in New York in February.
The film by the young Yugoslav who has become a British citizen, is
a humorous, affectionate and poignant portrayal of a cross section
of Britons whose lives are unexpectedly disrupted by the Bosnian
nightmare in the fall of 1993. ``Beautiful People'' won the Certain
Regard competition at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival. By Alan
Riding. (Moved). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HIGH-SIERRA-FILM (San Francisco) _ Humphrey Bogart was born on
Christmas Day in 1899, and we're sure to be inundated this year
with juicy behind-the-scenes tales about the making of beloved hits
like ``Casablanca'' and ``The Big Sleep.'' But the movie that
marked him as a towering star who would redefine crime movies, and
action films in general, was Raoul Walsh's stirring 1941 melodrama,
``High Sierra.'' With John Huston turning writer-director, he and
Bogart went on to make ``The Maltese Falcon,'' ``Across the
Pacific,'' ``The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,'' ``Key Largo,''
``The African Queen'' and ``Beat the Devil'' _ arguably the most
diverse and compelling credits ever compiled by an American
actor-director team. Although Huston was only the co-writer, ``High
Sierra'' deserves a place near the top of that list. (It returns to
the small screen in March as part of Warner Home Video's new Bogart
Collection.) By Michael Sragow. (Moved). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BREATHLESS-FILM (Undated) _ An amiably cocky Frenchman in
sunglasses steals a car, mugs people for petty cash to romance a
cute American student and tries to collect money from shady
characters so he can run away with her to Rome, but she seems more
interested in flirting with contacts to secure a writing job,
besides which she is pregnant by the Frenchman and he seems
indifferent to this fact, while a police manhunt closes in on them
both. No wonder they called it ``Breathless''! Actually, the
original title, ``A Bout de Souffle,'' might be better translated
as ``Out of Breath,'' with more somber connotations. Forty years
after it shook up the movie world, Jean-Luc Godard's brilliant
provocation is being revived at the Film Forum in New York City for
one week, April 7-13, in a new print. By Phillip Lopate. (Moved). &QL;

   STUTTGART-BALLET (Stuttgart, Germany) _ Two years ago, New York
audiences witnessed the first of the Canadian Reid Anderson's
accomplishments when the Stuttgart Ballet performed at the Lincoln
Center Festival '98: two by its former director, John Cranko's
masterpieces, ``Onegin'' and ``Romeo and Juliet,'' provided a
showcase for the company's dramatic and technical skills. This week
the company returns to New York on Wednesday for four days at the
City Center during a seven-city tour with what it calls ``the other
side of Stuttgart,'' five new pieces (plus one by Cranko, who died
in 1973). By Kate Mattingly. (Moved). &QL;

<P>
   ZANDER-MUSIC (Undated) _ What is it about Boston and musical
cult figures? The opera producer Sarah Caldwell and the pianist
Russell Sherman are merely the more prominent of recent decades. If
a musician can make it there, in that hotbed of musical culture and
tradition, you might think, he or she can make it anywhere. The
quintessential cult figure of the moment is Benjamin Zander, 60, a
conductor and the founding music director of the Boston
Philharmonic Orchestra. By James R. Oestreich. (Moved). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LEPORELLO-MUSIC-FILM (Toronto) _ On the principle that every
exit is an entrance somewhere else, Tom Stoppard once wrote
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, Hamlet's dim college pals from
Wittenberg, title roles in a show of their own. Now Barbara Willis
Sweete, a founding partner of the Canadian film production company
Rhombus Media, is doing the same for Leporello, the sidekick of
Mozart's Don Giovanni. Her hourlong film-within-a-film
``Leporello,'' which strings together in their original order
excerpts from Mozart's sulfur-singed operatic masterpiece, will be
introduced at festivals next fall, with television broadcasts to
follow on PBS and cultural channels around the world. By Matthew
Gurewitsch. (Moved). &QL;

<P>
   PIAF-IMITATOR (Undated) _ Where singers are concerned, imitation
is often the insincerest form of flattery. Imitating the sound of
someone else's voice is never solely an act of homage, however
inspired by admiration. Rather, it is a kind of cannibalization,
with one singer feeding on a more singular existing voice and
saying: ``Hey, I can do that. But this way.'' Raquel Bitton, 38, a
cabaret singer from San Francisco, is, to put it mildly, stuck on
Edith Piaf. Since discovering the repertory of Piaf in 1982, Ms.
Bitton, who was herself born in Marrakesh, Morocco, has helped
produce a show about the legendary French chanteuse for National
Public Radio, consulted on a television documentary, composed a
play with music about Piaf's friendship with Jean Cocteau, written
the scenario for a full-length Piaf ballet and, most decisively,
learned to sing very much like her idol. By Barry Singer. (Moved). &QL;

   &UR; ART &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ARCADES-PROJECT (Undated) _ Some of us don't read fiction. We
live on history, biography, criticism, reporting and what used to
be called belles lettres. We will be feasting on Walter Benjamin's
``Arcades Project'' for years to come. Just published by Harvard
University Press in the first full English-language edition, ``The
Arcades Project'' should also win readers with broader tastes. A
sprawling, fragmented meditation on the ethos of 19th-century
Paris, ``The Arcades Project'' was left incomplete on Benjamin's
death in 1940. In recent decades, as portions of the book have
appeared in English, the unfinished opus has acquired legendary
status. ``The Arcades Project'' surpasses its legend. It captures
the relationship between a writer and a city in a form as richly
developed as those presented in the great cosmopolitan novels of
Proust, Joyce, Musil and Isherwood. By Herbert Muschamp. (Moved). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   COURT-PAINTERS-ART (Madrid, Spain) From the 15th century to the
18th century, many fine painters were wooed with money, security
and status and in exchange spent their time glorifying the
``ideology'' of the Roman Catholic Church and exalting assorted
popes, monarchs and military heroes. They also produced prodigious
art. This was certainly the case with three masters of the
post-Renaissance, whose relationship with power is the subject of
``Velazquez, Rubens, Van Dyck: Court Painters of the 17th
Century,'' a new exhibition at the Prado Museum in Madrid that runs
through March 5. Each artist had his own style of painting, but
they nonetheless had much in common: their careers coincided during
two decades; they supported the Catholic Counter-Reformation;
Velazquez and Van Dyck looked up to Rubens, 22 years their senior;
and all revered Titian, who died in 1576, the year before Rubens's
birth. But what most united them was that they were first and
foremost court painters. By Alan Riding. (Moved). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VALIE-EXPORT-ART (Undated) _ Since the late 1950s, the Austrian
artist, Valie Export, has been challenging images of the female
body in media through her own prodigious output of videos, films,
performances, photographs, installations, documentaries and
writings. Represented in scores of exhibitions in Europe since the
1970s, the 59-year-old artist is only now receiving her first solo
exhibition in the United States, from Tuesday through Feb. 27 at
the Goldie Paley Gallery of the Moore College of Art and Design in
Philadelphia. By Michael Rush. (Moved). &QL;

VOTERS WANT TO KNOW: DID HILLARY CHEAT? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (p and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ So it comes down to that familiar question: What did
Hillary Rodham Clinton know and when did she know it?
</P>
<P>
   The mystery this time isn't about Whitewater, Travelgate, or
cattle futures. It's about the quiz she took Wednesday night on
``The Late Show with David Letterman.''
</P>
<P>
   In the course of a wildly successful appearance _ she laughed,
cracked jokes, seemed relaxed, and in short, did everything a
politician needs to do on a late-night television talk-show _
Clinton aced a quiz from Letterman to gauge her knowledge of New
York arcana.
</P>
<P>
   A major point working against the first lady in her campaign to
become New York's junior senator is the ``carpetbagger issue'' _
the fact that she has never lived here before. As Letterman perhaps
only half-jokingly put it before giving her the quiz, her score
``could make or break the entire campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton scored a perfect five out of five. But now, it turns
out, she was given _ as her campaign spokesman, Howard Wolfson,
acknowledged _ ``a peek'' at the questions ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson insists she was not given the answers. But, in tis age
of cellular phones and Internet fact-books, is this distinction
much more than a semantic one?
</P>
<P>
   The issue hardly amounts to Watergate. It's not even close to
Charles Van Doren and the ``$64,000 Question'' fraud. Still, the
question remains: Did Hillary cheat?
</P>
<P>
   Rob Burnett, Letterman's executive producer, laughed when the
subject was brought up in a phone interview Thursday. ``Asking me
this question,'' he said, ``is like asking the World Wrestling
Federation, `Do you fake blood?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' he continued, ``we are not `Meet the Press' over
here. All we're trying to do is get a few laughs.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Burnett dutifully retraced the chronology. ``The idea of
the quiz was Dave's idea. It came up very late in the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not know there would be a quiz, both Burnett and
Wolfson said, until she entered the Ed Sullivan Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 15 minutes before air, we let her know that we would
give her a quiz about New York,'' Burnett said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither he nor Wolfson would delve into how close a ``peek''
Clinton had of the questions. However, they both insisted she knew
the answers on her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding is that, because of the obvious circumstances
_ accused of being an `outsider' and all that _ she's extremely
well-briefed,'' said Burnett.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as one of Clinton's aides, who asked not to be identified,
put it, ``We've long assumed, at some point, someone would ask her
what the state bird is.''
</P>
<P>
   Letterman's tested Clinton on New York's state bird (the
bluebird), tree (sugar maple), highest mountain range
(Adirondacks), Great Lakes borders (Ontario and Erie), number of
counties (62), and, finally, the New Yorker known with equal
measures of fear and reverence as ``The Big Guy'' (why, David
Letterman, of course).
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Clinton's likely
Republican opponent in the Senate race, did not return phone calls
Thursday for comments on Clinton's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Her appearance certainly had good results for everyone else
involved. Overnight reports indicate the program earned a 9.0
rating and a 20 share in the New York City area _ three times as
many viewers as Letterman lures on average. Nationwide, figures
were only slightly lower _ an 8.6 rating, about 2 1/2 times more
than its usual rating and nearly double Jay Leno's draw on NBC's
``Tonight Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnett said Clinton agreed, after the show, to come back
sometime for another appearance. Giuliani, who has been on the
program 16 times since 1994, will no doubt come on again, too,
Burnett added, though no date has been set.

LORE OF A LEGEND AND HIS BLUES

   LORE OF A LEGEND AND HIS BLUES
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure about the death of the blues musician Robert
Johnson, except that it was in 1938 at the age of 27. In Robert
Mugge's documentary ``Hellhounds on My Trail: The Afterlife of
Robert Johnson,'' Willie Coffee, a childhood pal of Johnson's in
Mississippi, says the cause was pneumonia. Another source contends
that Johnson was poisoned in a juke joint by the husband of one of
his lovers. The death certificate says syphilis. Coffee reiterates
that it was pneumonia. Anyway, no one knows where Johnson,
enigmatic and mercurial, is buried. Supposedly there are two
graves.
</P>
<P>
   Packed with history and lore and scalding Johnson blues from the
likes of Bob Weir of the Grateful Dead, Honeyboy Edwards, Joe Louis
Walker, Billy Branch and Robert Lockwood Jr. (Johnson's stepson),
``Hellhounds'' is to be released by Winstar on tape and DVD on Jan.
25. Also on Jan. 25, Winstar will issue ``Deep Blues: A Musical
Pilgrimage to the Crossroads,'' a Mugge documentary that begins in
Memphis and winds through northern Mississippi and the rest of
blues country.
</P>
<P>
   Both films are part of a five-film Mugge retrospective that
opens at the Screening Room in Manhattan on Jan. 21. About 20 Mugge
movies about music and musicians from many places but primarily the
South date to ``George Crumb: Voice of the Whale'' in 1976. Those
on video, also from Winstar, include ``Gospel According to Al
Green,'' about the soul star who turned to gospel, and ``Black Wax:
Gil Scott-Heron,'' with the jazz and rap musician performing in
1982 at the Wax Museum Nightclub in Washington. These two films
will also be shown at the Screening Room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep Blues'' was made in 1990. ``The mission is not only to
document artists who are out of the mainstream,'' Mugge, 49, said
in an interview, ``but also tell about people who are in it for the
music and not for the money.'' Booker T. Laury sings ``Memphis
Blues,'' R.L. Burnside ``Jumper on the Line,'' Jessie Mae Hemphill
``You Can Talk About Me.'' Everywhere is original male pain,
searing and teary. ``Daddy, when is Mama comin' home?'' cries Big
Jack Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Johnson wrote the blues' strongest songs in the '20s and
'30s. In ``Deep Blues'' Lonnie Pitchford sings two: ``If I Had
Possession Over Judgment Day'' and ``Come On in My Kitchen.'' The
film visits Bentonia, Miss., where Johnson is said to have sold his
soul to the devil, a Yoruba sprite and trickster, for mastery of
the blues.
</P>
<P>
   His influence spread to performers like Muddy Waters and on to
the Rolling Stones and the British rockers. After Johnson's songs
were finally copyrighted, Eric Clapton was one of many artists
asked to pay fees for being so derivative. As the story is told in
``Hellhounds,'' he gladly complied.
</P>
<P>
   The film is built around a Johnson symposium held at the Rock
'n' Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland in 1998. The title, a play on
the Johnson song ``Hellhound on My Trail,'' refers to all the
Johnson experts and fans, Mugge included, gathered in a gleaming
I.M. Pei building dedicated to rock stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted a gentle satire of middle-aged white guys _ scholars,
journalists, musicians, filmmakers _ all just obsessed with this
black itinerant musician,'' he said. ``You can't miss the irony.''

   Unable to afford the action star Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy), the
hard-pressed but indefatigable movie producer Bobby Bowfinger
(Steve Martin) plans to trail Ramsey around town with a camera and
have actors Bobby can afford (meaning they work on spec) accost
Ramsey at the deli or wherever and film whatever transpires for
Bobby's space flick, ``Chubby Rain.'' If that sounds crazy,
remember that it took Tom Cruise two years to realize he had been
in a vampire movie. Eventually, though, Bobby must turn to a Ramsey
look-alike named Jiff (also Murphy). Jiff is pretty good, too,
Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, as is Frank Oz's
``Bowfinger,'' which is ``smoothly directed and acted with glee.''

   Summoned to a desolate hotel room, a wild, gorgeous young
prostitute named Penny (Michelle Hicks) finds a different kind of
client: a gaunt pair of conjoined twins, Blake and Francis
(portrayed by the identical twins Mark and Michael Polish). The
stronger of the two, Blake, is more attracted to the kind-hearted
Penny. Odd man out and with no place to go, Francis languishes as
he and Blake face larger issues of dominance in a partnership that
can no longer survive. This they do in a film, directed by Michael
Polish, with ``style, gravity and originality to spare'' (Janet
Maslin). &QL;

   Between a crashing score and a monosyllabic screenplay, it's
hard to get one's bearings in John McTiernan's film. Exiled from
Baghdad for a sexual indiscretion, a poet named Ahmed (Antonio
Banderas) travels to a faraway land, and on the way meets a band of
Norse warriors who enlist him to help combat a flesh-eating demon
army. Anyway, heads roll in a ``slaughter-by-numbers swashbuckler
whose climactic battle seems almost perfunctory compared with what
has come before'' (Stephen Holden).

   Reverse his position in Parliament on an Argentine canal
project, and Mrs. Cheveley (Marianne Moore) will spare the dashing
Sir Robert Chiltern (Jeremy Northam) certain disclosures that will

   Unable to afford the action star Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy), the
hard-pressed but indefatigable movie producer Bobby Bowfinger
(Steve Martin) plans to trail Ramsey around town with a camera and
have actors Bobby can afford (meaning they work on spec) accost
Ramsey at the deli or wherever and film whatever transpires for
Bobby's space flick, ``Chubby Rain.'' If that sounds crazy,
remember that it took Tom Cruise two years to realize he had been
in a vampire movie. Eventually, though, Bobby must turn to a Ramsey
look-alike named Jiff (also Murphy). Jiff is pretty good, too,
Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, as is Frank Oz's
``Bowfinger,'' which is ``smoothly directed and acted with glee.''

<P>
   STUTTGART, Germany _ In the late 1960s, the Stuttgart Ballet, an
obscure German troupe, catapulted to international fame under its
charismatic director, the choreographer John Cranko. Then in 1973,
Cranko died suddenly, and the company was left to carry on and
redefine itself.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, the Canadian Reid Anderson, a member of the
Stuttgart Ballet from 1969 to 1985 and the artistic director of the
National Ballet of Canada from 1989 to 1996, took over the
directorship.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, now 50, saw his mission as four-pronged: to perform
works choreographed by Cranko _ to ``keep John alive'' _ and to
perform classic productions, ballets by 20th- century masters and
``the brand-new.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, New York audiences witnessed the first of
Anderson's accomplishments when the Stuttgart Ballet performed at
the Lincoln Center Festival '98: two of Cranko's masterpieces,
``Onegin'' and ``Romeo and Juliet,'' provided a showcase for the
company's dramatic and technical skills.
</P>
<P>
   This week the company returns to New York during a seven-city
tour with what it calls ``the other side of Stuttgart,'' five new
pieces (plus one by Cranko). This time at City Center for four days
starting on Wednesday, the company will present two programs of
ballets by a multinational group of choreographers: in addition to
the piece by the South African-born Cranko, there are works by
Italian, American, German and Dutch dancemakers.
</P>
<P>
   Since September 1996, Anderson has presented 15 new ballets.
``I'm not talking about a ballet new to the company,'' he says.
``I'm talking about (italics)brand-new(end italics) ballets''
commissioned by and for Stuttgart. ``I have the great good fortune
that I can afford to do so much new repertory _ both monetarily and
as far as my audience is concerned. You have to be able to afford
to fail because making art is a risk. You just hope you pick
somebody with enough talent to do something that lasts over a long
period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   The American choreographer Kevin O'Day said during a telephone
interview from his home in New York that he appreciated the
willingness to take risks: ``Here, the presenters want to do the
same stuff that they know will sell tickets _ Merce, Paul Taylor,
Alvin Ailey. Presenters won't take a chance because the reality of
selling tickets is too strong. I get a different kind of sense in
Europe, where the government supports the arts.'' O'Day's ``Delta
Inserts,'' which had its premiere in Stuttgart last April, has its
New York debut on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Stuttgart Ballet ``has gone through a huge metamorphosis in
the last three years,'' Anderson says. The caliber of his dancers
has been foremost among his concerns. In 1996, he let go a number
of company members in order to reshape the ensemble (today, 75
percent of the dancers are his hires).
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in Stuttgart's opera house, Christian Spuck, a company
member, vividly remembers Anderson's talks with the dancers. ``I
was fired,'' he recalls with a grimace. But soon afterward,
Anderson saw Spuck's first piece of choreography and changed his
mind. Not only did the director want Spuck to dance for the
Stuttgart Ballet, but he also wanted his first piece of
choreography in the company's repertory.
</P>
<P>
   This week Spuck's ``Dos Amores,'' his fifth ballet, has its New
York premiere. The German dancemaker, who has already attracted
considerable attention in the European dance world, acknowledges
the freedom Anderson offers: ``Reid gives me everything. I can
choose all the dancers, the ballet master I want to work with. He
says: `Christian, don't be scared. Do what you think you have to
do. It is not important, success or not. You have to find your own
way. And that is fine.' That's quite something for a director to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stuttgart Ballet is renowned for nurturing choreographic
talent. Several of today's leading balletmakers _ William Forsythe,
Jiri Kylian, Uwe Scholz _ started choreographing as members of the
company and went on to direct European troupes. Unlike these
directors, Anderson is not a choreographer, but like Cranko, he is
attracted to and supports innovative choreography. ``I think it's a
positive that I don't choreograph because I am building a company
that dances a wide spectrum of repertory,'' he said. ``That's what
we do.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Anderson's first commissions, ``Kazimir's Colors,'' by
the Italian Mauro Bigonzetti, appears on Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In Stuttgart in late December, Bigonzetti rehearsed the lead
couple for his ballet. They were the third cast _ Anderson likes to
give as many dancers as possible the chance to perform _ but looked
first rate. Bigonzetti's ballet, inspired by his visit to a Kasimir
Malevich exhibit in Florence, dresses the dancers in bold colors.
The partnering is asymmetrical, off kilter; the man often moves the
woman by the elbow or underneath the arms. Bigonzetti, who directs
Aterballetto in Reggio Emilia, watched the dancers, gently chiding
``easy, easy'' as they risked everything to get it right.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The approach of the dancers is fantastic,'' Bigonzetti said,
sitting in the Opera House canteen after the rehearsal.
``Everybody's curious: they want to know, they want to see, they
want to do different things. It's incredible that they can do the
modern ballet, the classic ballet and the Cranko ballet. I love
this.'' What makes this possible? ``Their mentality,'' he answered.
</P>
<P>
   Another explanation is the John Cranko School: more than 50
percent of the company graduated from this school, which offers
professional training for German and international students.
Anderson may not choreograph, but he does play a major role in
selecting highly qualified dancers from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The nationalities in the 68-member ensemble include Spanish,
Swiss, Russian, Canadian, Ukrainian, Polish, Japanese, Yugoslavian,
Israeli, Czech, Australian and German (English is their lingua
franca).
</P>
<P>
   Scholz's ``Notations,'' a 12-minute solo set to music by Pierre
Boulez, has its New York premiere on Friday, danced by the
globe-trotting star Vladimir Malakhov. A principal dancer with the
Stuttgart Ballet and the American Ballet Theater and a guest artist
with the Vienna State Opera Ballet and the State Opera of Berlin
(Unter den Linden), Malakhov travels extensively in order to work
with the best companies and choreographers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no company in the world that has repertory like
Stuttgart,'' says the Ukraine-born dancer. Scholz created the solo
specifically for Malakhov.
</P>
<P>
   The choreography of ``Notations,'' a showcase of virtuosic
feats, demands constant shifts in space and energy; explosive leaps
are juxtaposed with tight spinning steps. ``It's difficult because
the music is not Mozart,'' Malakhov says, ``it's only sounds.''
Moreover, a hip problem impeded Scholz's ability to demonstrate
movement; Malakhov needed to interpret what the choreographer
wanted. ``I tried to catch all the movement like he wants me to
do,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Another display of skill, Cranko's ``Initials R.B.M.E.,'' leads
off both City Center programs. Created in 1972, the ballet,
featuring 40 dancers, highlighted the particular talents of
Cranko's star dancers Richard Cragun, Birgit Keil, Marcia Haydee
and Egon Madsen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very special time for the company, and a friend of
John's suggested the second piano concerto of Brahms,'' Anderson
recalls. ``John listened to it over and over again. I remember very
clearly he was very up and very positive. It was autumn: a
beautiful Indian summer _ the colors of the trees were
extraordinary. When he talked about the set and costume design with
Jurgen Rose, they decided that each movement of the Brahms would
have a feeling of a different season.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Hans van Manen's ``Kleines Requiem'' is an austere
ballet for an ensemble of seven. Originally made for the
Netherlands Dance Theater, the company van Manen directed in the
1960s, ``Kleines Requiem'' takes its title from the score, Henryk
Gorecki's ``Kleines Requiem fur Eine Polka.'' Anderson acquired the
piece after seeing its 1996 premiere in the Netherlands. ``It makes
a nice mix with all the other pieces,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the works at City Center reveals a different facet of
20th-century ballet choreography. ``They are all abstract: there
are no tutus and no big sets,'' Anderson says.
</P>
<P>
   For O'Day, who danced in Twyla Tharp's company and Forsythe's
Frankfurt Ballet, creating a ballet for Stuttgart was a
life-changing experience. ``I feel like I have to leave New York
now because there is no place for me to hang my hat,'' he says.
``In Stuttgart, there is such openness. I tell Reid my idea about
making `Delta Inserts' into a full-evening ballet and he says:
`Sounds great. Let's do it.' In New York, I am working for a lot of
people, but presenters worry about selling tickets with something
that is new. In Europe, there is more possibility for the creative
stuff.''

ISRAELIS TRY TO READ BETWEEN THE LINES OF `WORKING DRAFT' 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A leak of an American working draft of an
Israeli-Syrian peace treaty has created something of a stir here
with the suggestion that Israel is seeking to keep its settlers on
the Golan Heights after a military pullback from the area.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the document, which was distributed by American
mediators last week to both Syrian and Israeli negotiators in
Shepherdstown, W.Va., effectively sets out the opening position of
each side on the central issues under discussion, including future
borders and security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   The text was leaked to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, which
published it Thursday, along with photographs of the document.
</P>
<P>
   Under an introductory disclaimer that it is meant to serve as
``a tool in discussions'' and ``does not necessarily reflect the
views of any party,'' the draft treaty includes two passages
attributed to Israel that many Israelis interpret as an attempt to
retain Jewish settlements on the Golan even after a military
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   The document also notes the Syrian position that Israel must
withdraw both its soldiers and civilians from the entire strategic
plateau captured from Syria in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
</P>
<P>
   Though Israelis familiar with the Israeli-Syrian issue saw no
change in the widely held perception that Israel will have to cede
at least most of the Golan Heights _ and withdraw its settlers _ as
the price of a peace agreement, the leaked document seemed to serve
efforts to convince the Israeli public that its government was not
selling out. About 100,000 Israelis demonstrated against giving up
the Golan Heights on Monday as Prime Minister Ehud Barak returned
from a negotiating session in Shepherdstown.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations are scheduled to resume next week in
Washington, and President Clinton discussed the next round of talks
Thursday in a long phone conversation with President Hafez Assad of
Syria.
</P>
<P>
   What attracted attention in Israel were two references in the
draft document. One referred to the withdrawal of the Israeli armed
forces ``and civilians'' from the Golan Heights as solely a Syrian
position. The other cited an Israeli position that there would be
``arrangements concerning the Israelis and Israeli communities in
areas from which Israeli forces will be relocated'' _ a reference
to the 17,000 Golan settlers.
</P>
<P>
   These items created the impression that Barak was bargaining to
keep the settlers in place, even though the notion that Israeli
settlers would remain under Syrian sovereignty has been rejected by
both the Syrians and the settlers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a clever maneuver by the prime minister,''
said Ariel Sharon, the leader of the opposition Likud Party. ``The
prime minister knows that it will be impossible to live under
Syrian rule. He's perhaps trying to soften up the hard core that is
struggling today against a withdrawal from the Golan Heights. I
know that the prime minister frequently studies the writings of
Machiavelli. This is a perfect example.''
</P>
<P>
   Education Minister Yossi Sarid, of the leftist Meretz Party,
affirmed that keeping the settlers on the Golan ``is an Israeli
position.'' But he added, ``I would be very happy if this position
were accepted by the Syrians, but the chances of a positive
response are slight to nonexistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Uri Savir, a lawmaker who served on the Israeli delegation to an
earlier round of talks with Syria that collapsed nearly four years
ago, said that although leaks such as the disclosure of the
American draft might serve domestic political aims, they would not
help the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually every leak has its purpose,'' Savir said. ``From the
point of view of the negotiations, I don't think such publications
are helpful. The minute the three sides keep a secret, it's a test
of the seriousness of their intentions.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, James Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said
the publication of the document was damaging.
</P>
<P>
   ``It harms the cause of peace,'' he said. ``It makes it harder
for the kind of confidentiality that's necessary to make decisions
to be understood or expected by those who have to make decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   A Syrian account of the American draft was published on Sunday
by the influential London-based newspaper Al-Hayat, this one
emphasizing Syria's demand for the removal of Israeli settlements
and its insistence on a full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan to
lines held before the 1967 war.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Key members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, who ended a
two-day visit to Israel Thursday, said that the United States could
provide substantial funds and peacekeeping troops to bolster an
Israeli-Syrian treaty, but that the burden had to be shared by
other nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm certain we can meet whatever objectives the administration
and Congress agree to,'' said Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, the
committee chairman. ``We don't know what those will be yet, but we
assume they'll be substantial.''
</P>
<P>
   The five committee members toured the Golan Heights and Israel's
border with Lebanon on Wednesday, meeting later with Barak.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister has promised the Israeli public that Israel
will receive sophisticated defense and early warning systems to
offset the risks of a withdrawal from the Golan. However, Stevens
said that no financial sums were discussed in the meeting with the
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard no numbers, and we didn't expect to hear any
numbers,'' he said. ``We're not at that stage.''

HIGHWAY PROJECT UNEARTHS ANCIENT BOSTON HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a major find, archeologists working in downtown
Boston have unearthed part of Mill Creek, a colonial waterway in
the heart of the old city whose sediment is expected to provide a
broad glimpse of day-to-day living conditions in early Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Archeologists working under contract with the Big Dig say the
discovery near Haymarket will illuminate the lives of common
Bostonians from the earliest days of settlement to the mid-1800s.
</P>
<P>
   The long-filled creek, a catch-basin for a vast variety of
human, plant and animal deposits, has yielded ``a record of
environmental change in the city that's unprecedented,'' said
Stephen Mrozowski, a University of Massachusetts at Boston
professor who is chief archeologist for the find.
</P>
<P>
   ``Analysis of this will reconstruct in tremendous detail the
changing environment of that part of Boston from initial occupation
up through the mid-19th century,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Soil and sediment recovered from Mill Creek, now buried 10 feet
under Blackstone Street, are expected to provide a timeline stocked
with clues about landscape, climate, sanitation, diet and clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Excavation at the site began after a Big Dig backhoe struck
artifacts Nov. 16 behind a parking garage near the Holocaust
memorial. The digging yielded two, 2,200-pound millstones, large
pieces of a wooden wheel that turned the stones, wooden bulkheads
that supported the creek bank, leather shoes, animal bones, and a
thick layer of history-rich sediment.
</P>
<P>
   Early colonists dug Mill Creek in 1643 from Mill Pond, which
bordered present-day Haymarket, to the harbor near Faneuil Hall.
Tidal action in the creek was used to power a succession of grist
mills that ground grain for the settlers.
</P>
<P>
   The two millstones, intact and remarkably preserved, were
discarded into the creek from a nearby site where the grist mills
had been located since 1646. The stones are believed to date from
the 1700s.
</P>
<P>
   UMass archeologists met this week to discuss how to analyze the
findings. Excavation ended Dec. 21 and the site has been re-filled.
</P>
<P>
   As impressive as the millstones are _ and they are believed to
be the finest such artifacts ever found from colonial Boston _ the
true treasure is encased in the creek bottom, archeologists said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have samples of garbage from the bottom of the canal, and
we're going to be looking for pollen and insects and parasites,''
said Robert Hasenstab, staff archeologist for the Big Dig.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can look at the local environment of Boston's colonial
period: what kinds of plants and trees were growing in the area,
what kinds of bugs were crawling around, and maybe get some
information on disease residing in the trash and the animal bones
and meat scraps.''
</P>
<P>
   The end result: a people's history that gives a day-to-day
subtext to the well-known political headlines of colonial and
revolutionary Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Historical markers of common life have been found before,
including during the 1994 excavation of a nearby 17-century privy.
But what makes the Mill Creek find so intriguing, Mrozowski said,
is the nearly 200-year accumulation of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The privy site was ``fairly specific,'' Mrozowski said. The new
dig has more potential, he explained, ``because basically all of
this botanical material (native to early Boston), all of this
pollen, is making its way into Mill Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   The creek, whose tidal flow powered the grist mill, also was
used as a dumping ground for residents and merchants clustered in
the heart of their growing city. Analyzing this discarded material,
as well as the botanical evidence, should show changes in
landscape, disease, climate and sanitation, Mrozowski said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of what we know of the city is a political or economic
history. We tend to forget that, as all that's going on, there's
another level of reality that's shaping daily life,'' Mrozowski
added. ``What this allows us to do is put all of Boston's history
in a new environmental context that lets us reread it in a way that
may alter what we think about the city.''
</P>
<P>
   The find was unexpected, Hasenstab said, because a decade-old
study had concluded that the area was too disturbed for much
archeological recovery. But after the first millstone was
discovered, the hunt was on: Archeologists recovered another
complete millstone, 5 feet in diameter, and four pieces that each
comprise about one-third of a millstone.
</P>
<P>
   About half the wooden gearwheel that drove the mill was found,
still bearing the cogs that turned the machinery as tidal water
from the harbor rushed along the creek.
</P>
<P>
   Mill Pond was filled between 1807 and 1828; the creek met the
same fate in the early 1830s.

WALL STREET'S BRIGHT LIGHTS, CIRCA 2000: ELECTRIC COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Norris Column) 
(dal) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bond prices began this year by continuing the 1999
swoon, as Wall Street worried that the Federal Reserve might keep
tightening the monetary noose until the economy _ or the stock
market _ cried uncle. But even as interest rates racheted up,
something strange happened. The woebegone electric utility stocks
began to rally.
</P>
<P>
   Say what? It has long been taken for granted that utility stocks
always fall when interest rates rise. After all, electric companies
borrow a lot of money, and thus suffer when rates rise, and their
shares appeal only to the diminishing band of investors who value
dividends.
</P>
<P>
   So it is worth asking why the stocks are rising. Perhaps it is a
signal that bond rates do not have much farther to rise. Maybe the
move is an early warning that the Fed's rate increases are starting
to slow the economy, something likely to send stock investors
searching for shares whose recession exposure is limited. Perhaps
money managers fleeing technology stocks are trying to buy
something safe. ``I call it the anti-tech movement,'' said Steven
I. Fleishman, an analyst at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   To owners of utility stocks, the idea that they are safe
investments must seem odd. Last year the Standard &AMP; Poor's electric
utility index plunged 23.5 percent, its worst performance in a
calendar year since the monster bear market of 1974, when almost
every stock fell. Meanwhile, the S&AMP;P 500 rose 19.5 percent in 1999.
The best performer of the 29 stocks in the S&AMP;P electrics slid 5.6
percent. The worst lost 37.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the weakness was caused by rising interest rates, of
course, and year-end tax selling may have delivered a final blow to
the stocks. There were worries about how companies would fare as
competition intensified, but it appears that most states are
treating the incumbent companies well as they set the rules for
playing in the new era of deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   Then the tables turned as the new year began. The electrics are
up 3.7 percent, while the S&AMP;P 500 is down 1.3 percent. No doubt
some traders, in the time-honored if not exactly tasteful Wall
Street cliche, will dismiss the recovery as nothing more than a
dead-cat bounce. They probably expect that Yahoo, which has tripled
or better in each of the last three years but is down 20 percent
this year, will resume its levitation, and they may be right.
</P>
<P>
   But the chances are good that those who are buying the electrics
now will seem wise in a year or two. ``Valuations are at historic
lows,'' noted Pamela Bonnie, the electric watcher for Salomon Smith
Barney, when she turned bullish on the industry last month.
</P>
<P>
   Those valuations are getting noticed. In 1999, Warren Buffett's
Berkshire Hathaway led a group that bought one utility, MidAmerican
Energy. Another utility, TNP Enterprises, parent of Texas-New
Mexico Power, agreed to be acquired in a leveraged buyout sponsored
by a Canadian bank. (When that deal goes through, the holding
company's chairman will be William Catacosinos, whose tenure at
Long Island Lighting in New York left him with more popularity
among investors than customers.)
</P>
<P>
   The newfound interest of financial players in electric utilities
is a tribute to the fact that utility cash flows have not
diminished, even as their stock prices have. A third of the stocks
in the S&AMP;P electric index raised their dividends last year, and the
index now sports a healthy 5.4 percent dividend yield. The stocks
are cheap, regardless of whether Wall Street's love affair with the
Internet is over or about to become more passionate than ever.  &QL;

EX-PRESIDENT BUSH PRAISES SON'S ABILITIES WITH PEOPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC, Iowa _ Former President George Bush made a rare public
appearance Thursday, telling an Iowa audience that his son, George
W. Bush, had done more to ``bring people together'' in five years
as governor of Texas than his father had in 50 years in politics.
</P>
<P>
   In a rambling, self-deprecating talk to a thousand friendly
Iowans, the former president made it clear that his own political
career had become a secondary matter to his son's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Texas had a diverse population with a high
percentage of Mexican-Americans and African-Americans, the elder
Bush said his son ``has been able to do better than any Republican
before _ certainly including his dad _ in bringing these people in
to work and vote and hopefully to be served by a Republican
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking without notes _ ``These are remarks, I don't give
speeches anymore'' _ the 75-year-old Bush repeatedly praised his
son for reaching out to new constituencies. ``He's demonstrated an
ability to bring people together.''
</P>
<P>
   The former president said he had worked to create coalitions,
himself, assembling a multinational force for the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``George was at my side for a lot of this, in close touch with
this,'' Bush said. ``I think he'd be excellent in doing what I
tried to do as president.'' His oldest son, served as an informal
White House aide for part of Bush's term before returning to Texas
and winning the governor's office in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's appearance at a high school in the rolling plains near
the Nebraska state line was his first of the campaign this year. He
said he no longer delivered partisan speeches and had no intention
of criticizing his son's opponents.
</P>
<P>
   But in an implicit swipe at the man who succeeded him, President
Clinton, Bush said, ``I want to see us return to a society with
fundamental values.'' And he could not resist a one-liner in which
he claimed that one of the ``wonderful'' prerequisites of being a
former president included ``a call from Jenny Craig wanting to know
if I wanted to lose 30 pounds.'' Monica S. Lewinsky, the former
White House intern, is doing Jenny Craig commercials.
</P>
<P>
   For much of his 20-minute talk, Bush belittled his own role in
current affairs. ``I don't deal with issues anymore,'' he said. ``I
don't go into this reform of the system _ what to do about that
problem. I've been there, I've tried that. I messed some things up,
and I got quite a few things right.''
</P>
<P>
   His audience, which was composed of more middle-aged followers
than students, seemed glad to see him back in Iowa, the scene of
his first great political triumph as well as several subsequent
embarrassments.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Perkins, a music teacher from nearby Harlan who wore
``GOP'' jewelry on her lapel, said she admired the Bush family
because ``they're honest, down-to-earth people.'' The younger Bush,
she said, ``will return dignity to the office.'' Though Perkins
said she supported Ronald Reagan during the 1980 caucus here when
Bush made his first breakthrough, she voted for Bush in every other
election.
</P>
<P>
   After winning the 1980 caucus, Bush finished an ignominious
third in the 1988 Iowa caucus. As the Republican presidential
nominee, he also lost the state in the 1988 and 1992 general
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, many Iowans remember him fondly. US Representative
Greg Ganske, the Iowa Republican, called the former president a
``great example'' and said the election of Bush's son was essential
to give conservatives solid control of the US Supreme Court.
Several justices are expected to retire during the next four years.

GOT QUESTIONS, NEED ANSWERS ON COWOBYS, MAVERICKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
Got plenty of questions. Need help with the answers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Has Dot Com Cuban changed his mind yet about using Jerry Jones
as his ownership role model?
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Cuban, may I suggest Tom Hicks instead?
</P>
<P>
   Has Jesse Jackson's group filed a civil rights' protest yet over
the Chan Gailey firing?
</P>
<P>
   It's not just about color, is it, Jesse?
</P>
<P>
   Joe Avezzano?
</P>
<P>
   Isn't Coach Joe tight with Troy and tight with Jerry? Aren't
Troy and Jerry the head-coach makers and breakers at Valley Ranch?
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that what's wrong with the Cowboys to start with?
</P>
<P>
   Hasn't Coach Joe dealt with all segments of the locker room as
special teams' coach? It's true, isn't it, he's respected and liked
by the players?
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't Coach Joe love to run up and down the sidelines,
screaming and gesturing? Don't the fans love an ``emotional''
coach?
</P>
<P>
   Isn't Jerry Jones whistling ``Moon Over Miami'' if he thinks any
competent coach from the outside would take the Cowboys' job?
</P>
<P>
   Is this a suggestion Jones should promote Avezzano to head
coach?
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't Jones immediately eliminate any name endorsed by this
space?
</P>
<P>
   Who said anything about hiring Coach Joe? You never read that
here, now did you?
</P>
<P>
   Since Dot Com Cuban wants to sign Dennis Rodman, will he also
hear me out on giving Roy Tarpley a second chance?
</P>
<P>
   Or would that be more like a sixth chance? Seventh?
</P>
<P>
   Didn't a local general manager say last week, ``We're finished
spending?''
</P>
<P>
   Didn't a local owner answer that with, ``No, you're not.''
</P>
<P>
   Didn't Doug Melvin then sign pitcher Darren Oliver?
</P>
<P>
   Can you remember the last time an owner refused to spend less?
</P>
<P>
   Didn't I tell you, Mr. Cuban, to be more like Hicks?
</P>
<P>
   Did I read this right? Aaron Sele turned down $28 million from
the Rangers and eventually had to settle for $15 million from the
Mariners?
</P>
<P>
   Is my math right? Did Sele cost himself $13 million in one week?
</P>
<P>
   Will Kenny Rogers accept my apology for calling him the dumbest
pitcher the Rangers ever had?
</P>
<P>
   How exactly did Sele's agent explain this little screwup to
Aaron?
</P>
<P>
   Given the choice of keeping only one, would it have been Chan
Gailey as coach or Jerry Jones as general manager?
</P>
<P>
   When Jones seeks an honest and private opinion from Troy, does
Aikman ever look him in the eye and say, ``Jerry, stop being an
idiot?''
</P>
<P>
   Who would Avezzano hire as his offensive coordinator?
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Rhome?
</P>
<P>
   That names sounds familiar _ didn't Aikman love Rhome when Jerry
was quarterback coach here way back in '89?
</P>
<P>
   Why have I seen at least a hundred replays of the ``Music City
Miracle'' and still think Buffalo was jobbed?
</P>
<P>
   Why do all these people keep saying the play was legal? What
exactly are they watching?
</P>
<P>
   Does Lindy Ruff also cry over football?
</P>
<P>
   The referee in Nashville last week who made the instant replay
decision against the Bills _ doesn't he live in Irving?
</P>
<P>
   Don't the Stars office and practice in Irving?
</P>
<P>
   Why am I laughing?
</P>
<P>
   Did you get a good look at the Stanley Cup as it made the local
rounds last summer? Got your picture taken with it, didn't you?
</P>
<P>
   Come next summer, all we're gonna have of the Stanley Cup around
here will be our memories _ don't you think?
</P>
<P>
   Are you as excited as I am about seeing Nine-Toed Deion in the
Pro Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   Did you ever think there'd be a time when Nine Toed made a
better columnist than player?
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't it Jim Reeves who asked if Deion counted against the
``Star-Telegram'' salary cap?
</P>
<P>
   What salary cap, Revo?
</P>
<P>
   John G. Dooley?
</P>
<P>
   What was the biggest sports story this week _ Gailey being fired
or John G. resigning as the only race caller Lone Star Park ever
had?
</P>
<P>
   You already know my answer, don't you?
</P>
<P>
   Can I just say how much I'm going to miss Dooley bringing home
the horses next summer? Can I also say, good luck to John calling
the races in Chicago?
</P>
<P>
   Is it backstabbing if the owner asks if you're happy with the
offensive system and the quarterback tells him the truth?
</P>
<P>
   Does the QB realize what a P.R. bloodbath he just took? Does he
care?
</P>
<P>
   Is Dot Com Cuban really serious about this Rodman thing?
</P>
<P>
   If he is, shouldn't we really have to wonder if those good first
impressions are now null and void?
</P>
<P>
   Have I mentioned that Stephen Jones' name is constantly uttered
in reverent-like tones around Valley Ranch these days? What's this
_ the No. 1 son being viewed as the eventual savior?
</P>
<P>
   You're guessing then that Stephen must take after his mother?
</P>
<P>
   Many questions. So few answers.

CYPRESS GROUP BUYS INTO ON-LINE GROCERY COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A New York equity firm, Cypress Group, Thursday agreed
to invest $100 million in HomeRuns.com of Somerville as it acquires
an undisclosed majority interest in the on-line grocery delivery
business.
</P>
<P>
   With plans to expand into 20 other unspecified markets over
three years, HomeRuns.com will be headed by Robert J. Tarr Jr.,
former chief executive of Harcourt General Inc. and The Neiman
Marcus Group.
</P>
<P>
   Hannaford Bros. Co., the Maine-based supermarket chain that
started HomeRuns.com and has run it as a wholly owned subsidiary,
will retain a ``significant investment'' in the on-line service.
HomeRuns.com will continue to buy its inventory from Hannaford at a
``substantial discount,'' Tarr said.
</P>
<P>
   Tarr, who left Harcourt General three years ago, said the
HomeRuns.com management team will be kept intact. Currently, the
company operates only in the Boston market, where it claims to have
about 40,000 customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is a terrific platform for growth,'' Cyprus's
vice chairman, James L. Singleton, said of HomeRuns.com.
</P>
<P>
   A deal such as this one was expected. Even before it agreed
recently to be acquired by a Belgian company, Hannaford had said it
needed outside capital to expand HomeRuns.com.
</P>
<P>
   Despite big upfront costs, the on-line grocery business is a
crowded aisle in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The prize is the more than $450 billion that US consumers spend
on groceries a year. Even if on-line retailers divert only a
fraction of sales away from supermarkets, the niche could still be
one of the biggest consumer categories in e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   No one, including HomeRuns.com, has reported a profit yet,
however.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester Research Inc. of Cambridge estimates that consumers
spent $513 million on line for groceries last year, and that the
number should hit $1.1 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy A. DeMello, founder and chief executive of rival
Streamline.com Inc. of Westwood, said on-line grocery sales could
reach $70 billion in five to seven years.
</P>
<P>
   With its dense population and its suburbs full of Web-savvy
consumers, Greater Boston is one of the most competitive on-line
grocery markets in the country, DeMello said. Soon, though, many
major markets could have as many choices as the Boston area does
now.
</P>
<P>
   Besides HomeRuns.com and Streamline.com, some Greater Boston
consumers can also buy groceries from Peapod Inc. of Skokie, Ill.,
which is aligned locally with Stop &AMP; Shop Cos., and from
ShopLink.com Inc. of Westwood.
</P>
<P>
   In California, Webvan Group Inc. recently attracted attention
with plans to spend $1 billion to build a national network of
highly automated warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's HomeGrocer.com Inc. of Washington state, which has
financial backing from Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Each grocery company offers a variation on the home-delivery
theme. But with so many players, consolidation is likely.
</P>
<P>
   According to analysts, on-line grocery services need high-volume
sales if they're to have any hope of making a profit. That means
rapid expansion to many markets.
</P>
<P>
   Groceries may be the foot in the door for outfits that will
deliver a wide range of higher-margin items, such as dry cleaning,
videos, beauty products, and beer and wine.
</P>
<P>
   HomeRuns.com plans to apply for a liquor license, Tarr said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is mostly about being a delivery business,'' said David
Cooperstein, director of on-line retail research at Forrester.
``Someday, you may have three selections for getting something to
your home: FedEx, UPS, or WebVan.''
</P>
<P>
   Something else may set on-line groceries apart from other retail
categories on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe that repeat customers are the key to making on-line
profits, and on-line grocery services seem to inspire more consumer
loyalty than do Web sites selling books or CDs, said Matt Stamski,
a senior analyst at Gomez Advisors in Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because groceries are bought so frequently, consumers
tend to get ``committed'' to an on-line grocery service, he said.
``It's not like an on-line bookstore, where you can zip in and out
in 30 seconds. That's why on-line grocery services have phenomenal
(customer) retention rates.''
</P>
<P>
   That consumer commitment is sometimes a requirement. Many
services require weekly delivery and membership fees of about $30 a
month, though HomeRuns.com does not. Placing an order on line can
initially take 45 minutes or more, but that can be shortened as a
consumer becomes more proficient at navigating frequently upgraded
Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on Hannaford's board, Tarr said he watched HomeRuns.com
for several years. The company does not disclose financial results,
but Tarr said they're ``materially higher'' than those of publicly
traded rivals. That led him to approach Cypress about investing in
HomeRuns.com, he said.

RUSSIAN ARMY RESTRICTS MOVEMENT OF CHECHEN MEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The Russian military, reeling from a series of bold
attacks by separatist rebels in Chechnya, has started cracking down
on civilians, preventing Chechen men and boys from fleeing or
entering the war-torn province.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights advocates are condemning the policy as endangering
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The punitive restrictions illustrate one of Russia's fundamental
problems in its military campaign in Chechnya. The Kremlin has said
for months it is fighting ``terrorists and bandits'' in an effort
to bring law and order to the troubled region. But frequently the
conflict has looked more like a war waged by Moscow against the
entire Chechen people.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers at border checkpoints between Chechnya and neighboring
Russian regions have been barring males between the ages of 10 and
60 from entering or leaving, according to reports from the region.
Human rights groups have condemned the policy, and the Paris-based
Doctors Without Borders Thursday accused Moscow of committing ``war
crimes'' in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   But officials in Moscow defended the move as part of security
measures to prevent rebel fighters from getting behind Russian
lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is better to check than to have a bloody slaughter,'' said
Vladimir Kalamanov, director of Russia's federal migration service.
</P>
<P>
   In a report released Thursday, the New York-based Human Rights
Watch, which has sent observers to the region, said the
restrictions are breaking up families and forcing civilians back
into the war zone.
</P>
<P>
   Zura Mumayedova, a refugee who fled Chechnya this week, told
Human Rights Watch she saw soldiers send back into Chechnya a
59-year-old man who was trying to flee the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian soldiers said that no men aged between 10 and 60
would be allowed through,'' the report quoted her as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Datu Isigova, a refugee from Chechnya's capital Grozny, was
quoted as saying she was forced by soldiers to leave her
11-year-old son and husband behind as she fled to the neighboring
republic of Ingushetia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russian authorities are obliged under humanitarian law to do
everything possible to avoid civilian casualties and allow
civilians to flee to safety,'' said Holly Carter, director of Human
Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. ``By preventing
Chechen men and young boys from leaving the republic, the Russians
are deliberately violating their international obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   Military experts here criticized the policy as ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an angry reaction with no rationale,'' said Pavel
Felgenhauer, a Moscow-based defense analyst. ``Harassing civilians
is not a way to fight a guerrilla war and such measures will not
stop rebel attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Ruslan Aushev, leader of the neighboring province of
Ingushetia, which is taking in most of the war's refugees, called
the policy a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fighting terrorism, you must not battle with peaceful
civilians,'' Aushev said in televised comments.
</P>
<P>
   The medical aid organization Doctors Without Borders, winners of
last year's Nobel Peace Prize, condemned the entire Russian
campaign in Chechnya in an open letter to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cities, villages, hospitals, refugee convoys and corridors
have now become targets. These acts against civilians constitute
war crimes,'' the group wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Since entering Chechnya in late September, Russian forces have
made steady progress in occupying the separatist province's
northern districts. But despite heavy air and artillery bombardment
of the republic's capital Grozny, Russian troops there have been
out maneuvered by the agile Chechen fighters and have been bogged
down outside the city for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In surprise attacks this past weekend, Chechen rebels broke
through Russian lines in three cities that had previously been
under Moscow's control. Russian military leaders claimed to have
regained control over two of the towns, Argun and Shali, although
they are still reporting fighting on the outskirts of Gudermes,
Chechnya's second largest city.
</P>
<P>
   After the attacks, Colonel General Viktor Kazantsev, Russia's
commander in the region said the military had made ``mistakes'' by
being too ``soft-hearted'' with the Chechen rebels. He also said
that only women, children and the elderly would be treated as
refugees in Chechnya, implying that all adult males were guilty of
siding with the rebels until proven otherwise.

DIG DEEP WITH INFORMATICA 1.0
</HEADLINE>
  (David Bloom's weekly Digital L.A. column on the intersection of
entertainment and technology) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: EMBARGOED until Sat. Jan. 15. Note (AT) symbol in tag) 
 
 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Off and on over about three decades, Stewart Brand and his
cohorts created various versions of ``The Whole Earth Catalog'' and
the equally useful quarterly Whole Earth Review.
</P>
<P>
   It was a terrific resource for people trying to find the best
tools and technology for all kinds of tasks, because Brand defined
the term ``tool'' in the broadest possible way, with essays,
reviews and contact information on everything from computer
software to post-hole diggers.
</P>
<P>
   The last catalog came out few years back, the quarterly shut
down then reopened for a while under other, less interesting
management, and Brand went off to write books about the 10,000-year
clock. Thankfully, however, something of the Whole Earth spirit is
living on, with the release this month of Informatica 1.0.
</P>
<P>
   Subtitled ``access to the best tools for mastering the
information revolution,'' it fancies itself a Whole Earth Catalog
without the manure spreaders (other than metaphorically speaking;
he does include some politically oriented Web sites).
</P>
<P>
   It's a great resource, loaded with reviews, excerpts, tips on
buying things like laptop computers and broadband services, even
goofy odds and ends like a search through an IBM database of U.S.
patents for hits on the term ``mouse trap.''
</P>
<P>
   Each page-long review gives prices, contact information,
background, related resources, even a product's likely obsolescence
horizon.
</P>
<P>
   The book nicely rewards a sustained read, or the serendipitous
opening to a random page. And though the book's organization feels
a bit haphazard, it is functional enough, with an index and table
of contents to make searching a bit more straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect part of my problem is that I long for a good search
engine for the book itself, and ``paperware,'' to use Black's term,
isn't so good for that. I'm guessing a more effective electronic
search tool is included in the CD-ROM (which I didn't get to
review) that can be bought in a bundle with the book, or
separately, through
</P>
<P>
   Author Peter M. Black also promises to issue regular,
downloadable disc updates to the book through the etronica Website,
creating what he calls in the introduction ``a kind of a magazine,
but without the lag time of paper.''
</P>
<P>
   A cool, quirky compendium of goodies for the digital age, I
highly recommend this book even with its minor shortcomings. After
all, as Black admits, this is version 1.0, and the first version of
anything technological always stinks. Imagine how great this will
be when Black hits his stride. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A HIT OF MYTHIC PROPORTIONS
</P>
<P>
   When the third-person fantasy strategy game Myth hit store
shelves a few years ago, it knocked a lot of players for a loop. It
was really one of the first games, particularly on the Mac side, to
do something interesting with 3-D graphics, and was hailed as one
of the year's best. Its successor, Myth II: Soulblighter, was
almost equally praised.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Bungie has gathered up the two games, a scenario pack
called Chimera, a bunch of other multi-player levels created by
fans of the game, and electronic versions of strategy guides for
the two games and put them in one three-disc package: Myth, The
Total Codex.
</P>
<P>
   The games aren't as ground-breaking as when they came out, of
course, but there's still lots to love here, with excellent
graphics and good gameplay, plus free Internet play on the
wonderful Bungie.net Website against other Myth-sters. Best of all,
the collection comes with a great price: $19.95. Don't Myth out. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHAT WANTS TO MAKE SOME REAL MONEY?
</P>
<P>
   All the PC gaming companies may have figured that something like
Quake III Arena or Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation would be the
Christmas season's biggest seller, but a funny thing happened on
the way to the cash register.
</P>
<P>
   According to gaming magazine Next Gen, the holiday box-office
champ for PC games turned out to be the computer version of the
insanely popular TV game show ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,''
minus the moolah when you answer Regis' questions correctly.
</P>
<P>
   The title from Disney Interactive and Jellyvision is certainly
entertaining enough, if lacking that certain something that comes
with sweating over an answer worth a million bucks. It's only
$19.99, though, which probably explains a bit of its wide-ranging
consumer appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope, however, that this PC-side success (there's also an
online version at www.abc.com) doesn't spawn the same execrable set
of copycats that the TV program did. ``Greed: The PC Game'' doesn't
work for me. And if I see a commercial for one more ``Who Wants
...'' knockoff before the February sweeps period kicks in, I'm
gonna make like Janet Leigh (or Neve Campbell) and scream. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THROUGH THE ROOF
</P>
<P>
   With the Consumer Electronics Show safely behind us, it's a good
time to note that the show's sponsor, the Consumer Electronics
Association, has now declared DVD the fastest selling consumer
electronics product ever.
</P>
<P>
   Electronics companies sold 349,000 DVD players in the product's
first year, 1997, then jumped to 1.08 million units in 1998. Final
figures for 1999 are expected to top out around 3.5 million, and
that doesn't count millions more DVD-ROM drives installed in
computers of even modest cost, such as those by budget-conscious
e-Machines and Avatar Technologies' V-Box.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, about 5 million DVD players have already been sold,
compared to about 1.1 million VCRs between 1975 and 1977, and 1.2
million CD players between 1983 and 1985.
</P>
<P>
   For comparison, CEA officials said, almost 10 times as many DVD
players were sold in their first year as CD players were, back in
1983. Of course, DVD players are helped by the fact that they are
backward compatible, in that they can also play CDs, whereas CD
players definitely couldn't play cassette or 8-track tapes or vinyl
records.
</P>
<P>
   Digital televisions, by the way, have been selling pretty well,
too, topping out at more than 100,000 units this year, despite a
couple of pretty substantial problems: they cost a lot, anywhere
from $4,000 to $20,000, and there's still not that much to watch,
random sporting events and the CBS evening lineup notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   My latest fave pick for a great DVD is ``The Wall,'' the old
Pink Floyd film that has been completely redone for the digital
age. Just as digital versions of ``Dark Side of the Moon'' were an
early favorite among audiophiles with compact-disc players, so too
will this be with DVD cognoscenti.
</P>
<P>
   The whiz kids over at Sony's High-Definition Data Center put the
original print through a transfer to sparkling high-definition
video, and the soundtrack was carefully remastered to 5.1 channels
from the original stereo under the direction of Chief Floyd, Roger
Waters.
</P>
<P>
   They put in a ton of extra goodies, including two different
documentaries about the film and band. The film itself may not have
been blessed with the visual jaw-droppers of ``The Matrix'' (aka
``The Film That Sold a Million DVD Machines''), but it's a great
disc.
</P>
<P>
   For oddball disc releases just in time for Valentine's Day (yes,
men, it's almost that time, so think ahead), how's about Fox
Consumer Products' release of three two-episode volumes of ``Ally
McBeal''?
</P>
<P>
   Fox is also issuing a boxed, two-disc compilation of all six
``Ally'' episodes, a Vonda Shepard music video and a booklet with
excerpts from ``Ally McBeal: The Official Guide.''
</P>
<P>
   In case you have legitimate wonders about many times you can
watch ``Ally,'' or what impact it might have on your love life, Fox
is also releasing some legitimately romantic movies, like ``Hope
Floats,'' ``Ever After'' and ``One Fine Day.'' Float on. &QL;

CHALLENGE TO BALLOT PETITION ANGERS MCCAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ He may have promised to avoid negative
campaigning, but Senator John McCain came awfully close to directly
criticizing Texas Governor George W. Bush Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At issue was McCain's place on New York's GOP primary ballot.
Under state party rules, candidates must collect 20,000 signatures
from party members in each of the state's 31 congressional
districts, to qualify for the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, who has the support of most high-placed New York
Republicans, this was not a problem. McCain, who filed a suit
challenging the ballot access rules in December, also collected
signatures and many more than the required 20,000. But now, those
signatures are being challenged, and McCain has accused the
challengers of using ``Stalinist'' tactics.
</P>
<P>
   McCain blames New York Governor George E. Pataki and state GOP
chairman William Powers and, indirectly, his chief opponent, Bush.
Bush's supporters broke a pledge not to challenge the Arizona
senator's right to be on the ballot, McCain said Thursday, and Bush
should call them off, ``out of fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm asking Governor Bush to tell his subordinates, Governor
Pataki and Bill Powers, to do what they said they would do, which
is not challenge our petitions and let us be on the ballot, because
that's only fair,'' McCain said after giving a speech to the New
Hampshire legislature.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was irritated by the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, the Berlin Wall came down,'' McCain said. ``Let's not
have the kind of Stalinist politics that the state Republican Party
of New York has been practicing. Everybody knows I'm a legitimate
candidate. Don't try to use the muscle of the New York Republican
Party and its apparatchiks to knock us off the ballot.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he would not behave the same way if his and Bush's
positions were reversed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never consider _ never consider _ allowing any
supporter of mine to challenge the right of Governor Bush to be on
the ballot in all 50 states,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush said Thursday he would let the New York Republicans
make their own decisions on McCain's petitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is important for all of us to play by the same
rules,'' Bush told reporters in Portsmouth, N.H. ``It's a process
to encourage grass-roots participation, and I am confident that
Chairman Powers will run the party in a way that's fair for
everyone ... What's fair is that we all play by the same rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign officials said this is a local issue and the New
York GOP is within its rights to do what it wants. The campaign
pointed out that New York is not the only state with strict rules
to get on the primary ballot, pointing to Virginia and several
other states.
</P>
<P>
   In McCain's State House speech, which focused mostly on his wish
to end pork-barrel spending, he announced his intention to appoint
a Cabinet-level official to serve as a ``reform czar, to help me
implement the changes in the institutions of government we must
make if we are to restore a government of, by and for the American
people as intended by our Founding Fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said afterward that it would be presumptuous of him to
name those he has in mind for that post, since it is still early in
the campaign. The only Cabinet appointee he has been willing to
mention so far has been retired General Colin Powell, whom the
senator says could have just about any post he wanted in a McCain
administration.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Reno upholds law in Gonzalez case
 &HT;    (EDs: This is an editorial from Friday's Atlanta Constitution)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Good for Attorney General Janet Reno for the sensible
opinion she rendered in the case of Elian Gonzalez. Some semblance
of constitutional order was necessary after a Miami judge turned
legal logic on its head in an effort to route to her family court
his Florida relatives' appeal to keep the 6-year-old in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration, after all, is strictly a federal matter. If the
Immigration and Naturalization Service order that Elian must be
returned to his father in Cuba is to be contested, Reno ruled
correctly that the only proper venue is federal court, not state or
local.
</P>
<P>
   If and when the relatives' appeal goes to federal court, chances
of a favorable ruling are slim. First of all, the INS already has
taken the position the only person who can petition for U.S. asylum
for Elian is his father, which he is not about to do. Moreover,
immigration law provides that asylum can only be granted where
there is an imminent threat of torture or persecution in the
petitioner's homeland, which nobody expects in Elian's case.
</P>
<P>
   It's not enough to argue Elian may suffer privation or
oppression in Fidel Castro's failed Communist state. The INS
routinely sends prospective immigrants back to countries where
poverty and tyranny are worse than in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   What matters most is that Elian, after losing his mother and
stepfather in a disastrous sea voyage to the United States last
November, needs the love and care of surviving family members
who've known him all his life _ his father and both sets of
grandparents in Cuba. True, they can't give him all the material
things his Miami benefactors can, but there are intangibles in
close family bonds that are more valuable than bicycles and trips
to Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   The next order of business for the Justice Department and the
INS is to resolve Elian's case promptly. They mustn't countenance
any delays by lawyers for his Miami relatives. He has been
separated from his loved ones too long.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the longer his return is put off, the greater the
chance of interference by calculating congressmen playing to the
anti-Castro lobby. Already one grandstanding Indiana Republican has
subpoenaed Elian to testify before a House panel, and others in the
Senate are preparing to vote the boy U.S. citizenship. Both ploys
are intended to thwart his reunion with his father.
</P>
<P>
   Congress reconvenes Jan. 24. The Justice Department and the INS
mustn't allow the opportunists of Capitol Hill to get their hooks
into Elian.

A REMOTE SAHARA VILLAGE STRUGGLES AGAINST SAND AND HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By NORIMITSU ONISHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARAOUANE, Mali _ The sand woman came out of the blackness of the
village master's house into the desert light, bearing a bowl of
sand that her hands had scooped from the doorway and would deposit
several feet away.
</P>
<P>
   It is a lifetime's work, this struggle against the sand, For
Souda Cissey and Araouane's other sand women, this struggle against
the sand is a lifetime's work _ a daily contest to prevent the
Sahara from burying, once and for all, this ancient village in West
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the world's largest desert has already taken
away a mosque and countless houses, the rooftops of some still
visible on the sand's surface, others fallen into the Sahara's
bottomless pits.
</P>
<P>
   The sand women clear courtyards and doorways from dawn to dusk
in Araouane, the once-fabled oasis six days by camel north of
Timbuktu, the city at the desert's edge, and nine days south of the
salt mines of Taoudenni, a place so desolate and forbidding that
political prisoners were once left there and told they could dig in
return for food and water, or run away.
</P>
<P>
   But run where in the Sahara?
</P>
<P>
   The sand women work except on days when the wind is so strong
that, sweeping down as it does from the eastern dunes, it blows
over sand much faster than they could ever clear it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's easier,'' Ms. Cissey, barefoot, said, looking down at
the ever-widening space she had cleared before the entrance. ``The
further you get away from the door, the easier it becomes. You have
less to walk.''
</P>
<P>
   The 30 families still left here have resisted the larger forces
that drove most away: the disappearance of the trans-Saharan camel
caravan, which once served as the main method of trade with the
African interior; the desertification that began with the severe
droughts of the early 1970s and killed the shrubbery necessary to
raise cattle; a rebellion against the Malian government by desert
nomads in the early 1990s that doomed a New Yorker's quixotic
attempt to plant trees in Araouane.
</P>
<P>
   So today, dunes cresting at 40 feet surround this village about
160 miles north of Timbuktu. Smaller dunes have formed inside the
village in the areas between the mud-brick houses, which seem to be
sinking deeper and deeper into the depressions. Sand rises as high
as the rooftops of many houses, whose owners clear only the
entrance. At other houses belonging to people too weak or old to
clear the sand, or too poor to hire the sand women, the inhabitants
must step down from the sand into their homes.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired,'' said Bela Bilali, an old man, though perhaps not
the 90 years he claimed to be. ``But what can I do except keep
removing the sand? I rest, then I get up again.''
</P>
<P>
   As his 2-year-old grandson stood beside him sucking on a piece
of raw lamb fat, the old man lay on a pile of sand in front of his
mud house. Although he could not recall the details, he said he had
lost two or three houses to the sand in recent years, the last one
when the wind blew for three straight weeks. Undefeated, he had
rebuilt on the same spot.
</P>
<P>
   Across his house, two other old men, laying still on the sand
and wrapped in blankets to shield themselves against the wind and
sand, told similar tales of lost houses.
</P>
<P>
   Abdi Sultan, a Muslim holy man in his 70s, only his wizened face
showing, recalled that in his youth there were more than 100 houses
here. Many used to be built close together in rows, he said. But
the houses at the ends would bear most of the sand; the homeowners
in the middle invariably refused to help clear the sand, so the
entire row would eventually be buried. Nowadays, houses are built
far apart from one another.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   People are believed to have settled in Araouane even before
Timbuktu was founded in the 11th century. The nomadic Berbers known
as the Tuaregs chose this spot because of its wells and grass for
their cattle, said Abdi Mohammed, imam of one of the three
remaining mosques. The Moors, a people of mixed Berber and Arab
descent, eventually took over the area and brought Islam. They also
brought black slaves from the south to take care of animals and
perform other tasks in a rigid hierarchy that survives to this day.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 3,000 people are thought to have lived here once,
Mohammed said. Now there are only a couple of hundred souls, who
depend entirely on passersby or trips to Timbuktu for food. ``The
people who have decided to stay in Araouane,'' the imam said,
``will stay until the end of their lives or until the end of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, the village served as a stopping point on the
camel caravan trade centered in Timbuktu. Traders brought salt from
the north and exchanged it for gold from the African interior.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the salt is almost worthless, though worth enough to send
Araouane's young black men to dig in the Taoudenni mines during the
current cool season. Moorish or Tuareg traders leading caravans of
30 to 40 camels, with each beast carrying four salt tablets
weighing several hundred pounds in all, pass through Araouane
almost daily on their way down to Timbuktu.
</P>
<P>
   Hamane Hilla, an irrepressibly cheerful man in his 70s, recalled
how he had dug in the Taoudenni mines until he was in his 50s and
his body could no longer stand it.
</P>
<P>
   The Moors, who controlled the mines and remain Araouane's
masters, would advance the miners credit _ less than $10 for five
months' work being the standard, he said. The miners worked six
days a week for their bosses, but were permitted to keep the salt
from the seventh day. Still, the Moors deducted whatever food or
water the miners consumed from their advances, so the miners
usually fell into debt, which sometimes took years to repay.
</P>
<P>
   But things have improved, Hilla said. His son is digging in
Taoudenni now and has been promised more than $40 for four months'
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not have his luck,'' Hilla said, smiling, his face
turned away from the blowing wind. ``I'm an old man now. I can't go
to Taoudenni, I can't go to Timbuktu. I can't do anything but go to
the mosque and pray.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It was on an aborted trip to Taoudenni in 1988 that an American
named Ernst Aebi, a surrealist painter from Manhattan, stumbled
upon Araouane. In his book ``Seasons of Sand'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster,
1993), Aebi wrote that after being struck by the village's
wretchedness, he planted trees to stop the encroaching Sahara, grew
a communal garden and built a school and even a hotel, which he
called the Araouane Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought the American had come to save us,'' said Chirach
Hamma, 27, who learned French in the school.
</P>
<P>
   But the development coincided with a growing rebellion against
the Malian government by the Tuareg nomads. The Tuaregs and Moors,
who proved the most resistant to Westernization under French
colonialism, found themselves marginalized after Mali's
independence in 1960. The descendants of the blacks, who had been
their slaves and received French education, now controlled the
national government and were not particularly open to their
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Tuareg rebels raided and destroyed villages in the Sahara. Peace
came in 1995 but only after the destruction of Aebi's projects.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the last couple of years, improvements have come to Araouane.
Italians built a school; the Red Cross, a dispensary.
</P>
<P>
   El Hadje Ahmed, 27, a nurse whom everyone refers to as the
doctor, arrived here in October from his hometown, Timbuktu. The
Red Cross regularly sends supplies, though the locals continue to
practice traditional medicine, which includes stuffing nostrils
with camel dung to fight colds and placing it against an aching
tooth.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed's father, a doctor, had ordered him to Araouane. But the
young man could not wait to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Araouane was a great city!'' Ahmed said, slumped on
the porch of the dispensary. ``Oh! I'd like to go back to Timbuktu
to renew myself, if only for one month. Go out dancing with my
girlfriends. I could never convince any of them to come here.
They'll see there's no dancing here, that all the women are
covered. My girlfriends wear short skirts and they don't wear
veils!''
</P>
<P>
   He said he hated how the Sahara had left a permanent coat of
fine sand on his skin, how the grains found their way between his
teeth and into every meal he ate. He said he hated watching the
sand women's Sisyphean labor, the same sand spilling back into the
spaces they had cleared.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place is hell,'' he added with finality. '
</P>
<P>
   The sun had begun to set over Araouane, and the sand women were
collecting the bags of rice or sugar, the equivalent of $1.60, that
they are paid for a day. Jnanbarka Handou Barik is over 50 but has
never set foot outside Araouane. ``I don't know anything about
Timbuktu,'' she said, adding, ``I hope the wind doesn't come
tomorrow, so I can work.''
</P>
<P>
   Aliou Fatima Metou, the man whose doorway she had cleared, took
in the stillness of the air and predicted that there would be no
wind on this particular night. He was right.
</P>
<P>
   But in the predawn hours, before the muezzin roused the faithful
for the day's first prayer, the wind had stirred. Soon the sand
flowed gently from the eastern dunes, rustling by the houses and
doorways all over Araouane, awakening no doubt the sand women from
their sleep.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Raise Georgia driving age to 17
 &HT;    (EDs: This is an editorial from Friday's Atlanta Constitution.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The major objections to raising Georgia's driving age
to 17 are the inconvenience to parents and the disappointment to
16-year-olds. But neither is compelling in light of the fatality
rates of young drivers and their passengers. Two out of every three
teens who died as passengers were in vehicles driven by other
teens, usually 16-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gingrey (R-Marietta) is sponsoring a bill that would
hike the driving age to 17 and require parents to sign sworn
statements they've given their child 50 hours of driving
instruction. The proposal won a key ally last week when Gov. Roy
Barnes endorsed the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, the number of deaths of 16-year-old drivers rose
about 50 percent from 1975 to 1996. During the same period, deaths
among drivers aged 17-19 declined 27 percent. The accident rate
among 16-year-olds is expected to climb even higher because the
country is in the midst of a teen explosion. The offspring of the
baby boom generation is growing up and grabbing the keys to family
cars.
</P>
<P>
   As an alternative to raising the driving age, some legislators
endorse more driver's education courses. But it's not a lack of
mastery that leads to many teen crashes. It's a lack of maturity.
Many of them forgo seat belts. They speed. They play games with
their cars. They pile in their friends and joy ride.
</P>
<P>
   Driver's education can teach kids handling skills and the rules
of the road. In Georgia, driver's education programs entail 30
hours of classroom training and six hours behind the wheel. But
those classes don't produce safer drivers, according to the
Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. By raising the driving age
and lengthening the learning phase, Georgia treats the two core
problems _ teen immaturity and driving inexperience.
</P>
<P>
   Today's teens are more likely to come from homes with at least
two cars, giving them more chances to drive. Teens don't shop on
Main Street or walk a half-mile to school. They drive 15 miles to
the mall and commute to a regional high school 40 minutes away.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers also rely on their cars for recreation. Fifty-three
percent of teenage motor vehicle deaths in 1998 occurred on Friday,
Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A bunch of kids cram in a car and drive around for hours. With
each additional passenger a teen driver carries, the risk of an
accident multiples. The passengers distract drivers and egg them on
to deadly behaviors.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey found that 67 percent of Georgia voters favor
raising the driving age. Legislators should keep that in mind when
the calls come flooding in from parents who want to retire their
chauffeur caps.

MANIC COMEDY AND KINKS CHANNELED BY JIM CARREY IN `MAN ON THE

R 118 minutes
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish it was better, but it's so stupid,'' says Andy Kaufman
( Carrey) at the start of his and Forman's movie. (Now he tells
us.) Apologies dispensed with, the manic comedian's story jumps to
his excruciatingly white-bread Long Island childhood and then on to
his first club dates. ``I can't sell booze when you're singing `Pop
Goes the Weasel,''' a bar owner complains.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the right agent ( DeVito) recognizes genius of a
sort and sells Andy to television. For a while, ``Saturday Night
Live'' is the only show that can contain his craziness, if barely.
Then comes the big break: Andy lands a steady gig on ``Taxi'' as
the weenie-voiced mechanic Latka Gravas. By then his popularity is
such that he can demand a special of his own and regular spots for
his trash-talking alter ego, the lounge singer Tony Clifton.
</P>
<P>
   When a college audience asks him to do Latka, Andy reads them
``The Great Gatsby.'' Looking for new avenues, he decides to be a
wrestler. Male opponents are too big, so he wrestles women, with
whom he goes rolling and crashing around the ring. A feud ensues
with the professional wrestler Jerry Lawler, who slugs him on the
David Letterman show. Everybody's kidding, right?
</P>
<P>
   But Andy's time is short. He is dismissed from ``Saturday Night
Live.'' His meditation group throws him out. ``Taxi'' is canceled.
When he tells his family and friends that he has lung cancer,
nobody believes him at first. For a finale, he plays Carnegie Hall
and takes the audience out for milk and cookies.

<P>
   Carefully manipulated to land every emotional jab and hook, the
story of Rubin (Hurricane) Carter ( Washington) centers around the
shotgun and pistol blasts that killed three people in a Paterson,
N.J., bar in 1966 and led to trumped-up, racially motivated charges
that landed the fighter in Trenton State Prison for life.
</P>
<P>
   In the ring, Carter's killer instinct takes out top opponents in
as little as one round. He's also a thinking man. In solitary
confinement, his violent side debates his rational side, and he
emerges determined to use his brains to help himself.
</P>
<P>
   He writes a book about his life, called ``The 16th Round,''
which is bought for 25 cents by a boy named Lesra ( Shannon). Lesra
can't read, but has caught the attention of three researchers (
Schreiber, Hannah and Ms. Unger), who have taken him to Canada for
home schooling.
</P>
<P>
   The book becomes the boy's bible. Famous people take up Carter's
cause. Bob Dylan writes a song called ``The Hurricane.'' But with
officials threatened by revelations of false testimony, petitions
for a new trial are denied. Carter withdraws. For the remaining
years he spends in prison (20 all told), he determines to live not
in the heart or the cell, only in the mind.
</P>
<P>
   The only person who can reach him is Lesra, who visits him and
later brings his three friends down from Canada. They, too, are
taken with Carter, who warily accepts them into his confidence.
They move to New Jersey and do much of the investigative legwork
for a new appeal.
</P>
<P>
   A particularly vicious police captain ( Hedaya) suggests that it
might be healthier if the three of them went back home where they
belong. Despite a suspicious car accident, they remain. With much
new material to consider, a hearing is granted. In a movie as
obvious as this one, could there be any doubt of the result? (In
real life, Carter is 62 and lives in Canada.)
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE The shootings are gory and in the ring the onslaught

worthwhile exercise for older children. Parents' choice. &QL;
</P>

for teen-agers, some of whom will be annoyed at the formulaic,

   Now in an old folks home, Paul Edgecomb ( Hanks) recalls a time
in 1935 when he was the chief guard on death row in a Southern
prison. This being a Stephen King story, settle in (at three-hours'
running time, there's a long road ahead) for a journey into the
fantastic.
</P>
<P>
   One day, an enormous man named John Coffey ( Duncan) arrives in
shackles to the cry of ``dead man walking.'' Convicted of the rape
and murder of two little girls, Coffey is really a gentle fellow
who is scared of the dark and calls everybody boss. Inside him,
glowing like a fiery furnace, is an otherworldly power to heal and
prolong life.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in blue serge suits, Paul and his men maintain a
civilized decorum around the cell block. Testing that policy, Percy
( Hutchison), a guard and the house sadist, stomps an inmate's pet
mouse and aspires to a job at a mental hospital where he would
better qualify as a patient.
</P>
<P>
   After walking the green mile, the condemned take their places in
the electric chair, an old contraption that blows lighting fixtures
but, if the sponges placed on their heads are properly wetted,
finishes victims with a minimum amount of agony.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, death row turns curiously rehabilitative. Taking hold
of the afflicted, Coffey cures ills from Paul's urinary infection
to the warden's wife's brain tumor. But to save him there could
well be no miracle. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE A steak at a barbecue has an easier time of it than one
prisoner does in the chair when Percy deliberately leaves the
sponge dry, turning the man into a screaming, writhing torch. Other
executions aren't much prettier, and there is a shooting and other
violence on the cell block. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX Paul and his wife (Bonnie Hunt) tastefully make up for lost
time after his infection is cleared up. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY Quite a bit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children? UNDER 14 No, this isn't ``Forrest Gump.''
Probably too long and convoluted for most. &QL;

MARINO BACKPEDALS FROM TALK OF RETIREMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is the fourth quarter of Dan Marino's career, and time is
running out. Even Marino admits he might not have another comeback
in him after this season.
</P>
<P>
   However, he and his Miami Dolphins were supposed to be finished
after last week. Instead, he pulled off the 37th fourth-quarter
comeback of his career in a 20-17 upset of the Seattle Seahawks,
and the Dolphins advanced to tomorrow's AFC divisional playoff game
against the Jacksonville Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   Until the clock on the Dolphins' season reads 00:00, Marino is
backpedaling from talk of his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows what my future will be,'' Marino said earlier this
week. ``I may continue to play. I may not. ... That's something you
have to look at when the season's over, and I've done that for the
last couple of years. You have to look at what happened and what
the circumstances were during the year. You just have to assess
what you're feeling, and how your body feels and all of those
things, and you worry about it then.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino is the NFL's all-time leading passer with 61,361 yards,
420 touchdowns and 4,967 completions. He also holds the distinction
of being the best quarterback never to have won a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In his second season, in 1984, the Dolphins lost to the San
Francisco 49ers, 38-16, in Super Bowl XIX. Miami has lost in the
AFC Championship Game twice, 1985 and 1992, in the 15 seasons
since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of my consistency over a 17-year period,'' Marino
said. ``This team was able to rely on me every week, and I feel I
played my position at a very, very high level. The big
disappointment is not being able to win a Super Bowl. That's what
you play for. That's a goal I had, and I still have.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino is 38. His body, which has endured eight operations, is
held together by braces, tape, painkillers and willpower. This
season he missed five games with a neck injury that limited his arm
strength when he returned.
</P>
<P>
   Marino used to win games. This season he has lost them.
</P>
<P>
   His 67.4 quarterback rating was lower than that of Tim Couch,
Jeff Garcia and Jim Harbaugh, among others. His 12 touchdown passes
and 17 interceptions was the worst ratio of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Miami coach Jimmy Johnson, frustrated that the Dolphins ranked
20th in total offense and tied for 23rd in turnover ratio, has been
openly critical of Marino all season. It is assumed that Johnson,
who also is considering retirement, and Marino cannot coexist on
the same team beyond this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I think Dan and I have a very good relationship,''
Johnson said. ``I think some people try to read more into every
statement made than what's really there. I'm fairly forthright as
my assessment of any of our players. The media has made more out of
it than what's really there.''
</P>
<P>
   After the victory Sunday against the Seahawks, Johnson charged
after Marino. ``Hey, Dan! Dan!'' Jimmy yelled to get Marino's
attention. Marino turned to find Johnson giving him two thumbs up.
Marino waved back in acknowledgement.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? It just as well could have been a wave goodbye.

<P>
   Some 92,000 people have visited the Massachusetts Museum of
Contemporary Art, the country's largest center for contemporary
visual and performing arts, since it opened in May. ``We'd hoped to
clear 100,000 the first year,'' said Joseph C. Thompson, the
museum's director. ``We've almost hit our target already.''
</P>
<P>
   Situated in North Adams, Mass., an economically depressed
blue-collar town of 14,000, the museum is attracting the kind of
tourists and homeowners who frequent places in the Berkshires like
Tanglewood in Lenox, summer home to the Boston Symphony Orchestra;
the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge; the Jacob's Pillow Dance
Festival in Becket; and the Williams College Museum of Art and the
Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, both in Williamstown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty percent of our visitors are from the New York
metropolitan area and 30 percent are from Boston,'' Thompson said.
``The rest are from all over the country and the world. We have a
strong international presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of its strong program in the performing arts, Thompson
added, the museum also seems to attract a younger audience than do
places like Tanglewood and the Norman Rockwell Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance at all the cultural institutions in Berkshire County
is seasonal. The most popular time begins around the middle of June
and goes through October. During the quiet winter months, officials
at Mass MOCA firm up their plans for summer programs while offering
smaller shows.
</P>
<P>
   Friday it is opening ``Super Model,'' an exhibition by artists
who fabricate and photograph artificial landscapes and citiscapes.
The show runs through June 9. The next of the much large
exhibitions, which are to be on view for at least nine months, is
``Unnatural Science,'' a collection of works that use the
discoveries, inventions and methods of science as inspiration. The
show, which will replace of the museum's inaugural show, will take
two months to install, but the museum will stay open so that
visitors can watch it take shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unnatural Science'' will formally open on June 3 and run
through March 15, 2001. It will occupy all 19 galleries. Because
the gallery spaces are fashioned from abandoned mills, 19th-century
factory buildings and overgrown courtyards _ all large in scale _
the museum can show works so big that the average museum doesn't
have room to exhibit them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unnatural Science'' includes two commissioned pieces. One, by
the California sculptor Tim Hawkinson, is an installation piece
that plays on the word organ. The other is by the photographer
Catherine Chalmers and consists of 30 photographs, each three by
five feet and showing a four-step food chain.
</P>
<P>
   The show will also feature several works that have been
exhibited elsewhere. Kiki Smith, for example, will show ``Sky''
from her ``Paradise Cage,'' reworking the version of the piece that
was at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles last year. In
``Paradise Cage,'' Ms. Smith explores astronomy 500 years ago and
incorporates glass stars and large glass animals in the work.
</P>
<P>
   Also on view will be ``Borealis'' by Steina Vasulka, an American
artist born in Iceland who was a pioneer in video art in the late
1960s. Her piece is being lent by the Center for Art and Media
Technology in Karlsruhe, Germany. It envelops the visitor in
electronically manipulated sounds and images from the stark
Icelandic landscape _ water, waves, volcanic rocks and geological
formations.
</P>
<P>
   The pieces in ``Unnatural Science'' come from various artists,
dealers, collectors and museums all over the world. ``We noticed,
over the last 10 years, an international group of artists working
in the realm of microscience,'' Thompson said. ``Whereas our last
large exhibition featured mostly artists from the 1950s and 1960s,
most of the artists in this show are younger and the subject matter
is hotter, more narrative.''
</P>
<P>
   PHOTOS FOR TEXAS
</P>
<P>
   When the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston opens its $50 million
building in March, with twice the space it has now, the museum will
have its first permanent gallery devoted only to photography.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of the expansion, Anne Tucker, the museum's
photography curator, has been enlarging the institution's holdings.
In the process, she has created a model that Peter C. Marzio, the
museum's director, says he hopes will be copied by other
departments.
</P>
<P>
   This week the museum announced that it had acquired 122
photographs: 36 by Diane Arbus, 20 by Brassai, 2 by Gerhard
Richter, 2 by William Eggleston, 30 by Yasuhiro Ishimoto, including
his ``Katsura'' portfolio,'' and 32 by David Levinthal.
</P>
<P>
   Most were gifts. The Arbus photographs, for example, were given
by Gay Block, a photographer from Houston who now lives in Santa
Fe. In appreciation of the gift, the museum's board voted to match
its value with $100,000 to purchase other photographs for the
collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of leveraging we're going to try to do in the
future,'' Marzio said. ``For people to see that their donation
creates other donations is important. If it works for photography,
we're going to try to see if it can work in other departments as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   TO AND FRO
</P>
<P>
   More comings and goings this week in museums and auction houses:
</P>
<P>
   _ After more than 27 years at Sotheby's, Thierry Millerand, head
of European furniture worldwide, has decided to leave. ``Sotheby's
has changed so much, with tremendous growth in areas like the
Internet, that I feel my skills can be better used elsewhere,''
Millerand said.
</P>
<P>
   _ At the Whitney Museum of American Art the plum job _ curator
of contemporary art _ remains vacant. But Maxwell L. Anderson, the
Whitney's director, created and filled two new curatorial
positions. Christiane Paul, will be adjunct curator of new media
arts. She is the editor and publisher of Intelligent Agent, a print
and online magazine about interactive media technology in arts and
education, and will be responsible for presenting, collecting and
conserving new media works. Michael Hays will be adjunct curator of
architecture. An architectural historian, he is a professor of
architectural theory at Harvard University Graduate School of
Design.

&HT;        TEXAS SMOG LEVELS ROSE IN 1999
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Alex Canizares  
 &HT;    c. 2000 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Jan. 13 - It's no secret that Texas is one of the
smoggiest states, and 1999 was a particularly bad year, according
to a national report released Thursday by an environmental
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The Clean Air Network and the U.S. Public Interest Research
Group Education Fund estimate that for 555 eight-hour periods in
1999, Texas exceeded the limits of what the Environmental
Protection Agency's deems healthy for ground level ozone, almost a
28 percent increase over the 432 smoggy periods recorded in the
state last year.
</P>
<P>
   However, initial figures reported by state agencies indicate
there was less smog in 1999 on the national level, the report said.
Last year there were at least 7672 eight-hour periods considered
unhealthily smoggy, over 7914 unhealthy periods in 1998. But the
report said that since violations for 1999 are still being
recorded, last year's levels will likely turn out to be higher than
in 1998 once they are all tallied up.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the number of unhealthy eight hour periods, the report
found Texas to be the second smoggiest state, second only to
California, which had 1217 such periods deemed unhealthy to people
and the environment. Other smoggy states included North Carolina,
which had 539 unhealthy periods, Pennsylvania at 512, Ohio at 461,
and Georgia at 407.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Crimmins, spokesman for the Texas Natural Resource
Conservation Commission, said Texas smog in 1999 was due to more
emissions, from a growth in population and manufacturing
industries, and bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   The TNRCC is pushing for ways to reduce emissions, such as
reduced speed limits. ``We don't need any statistical reminders
that Texas has a problem,'' Crimmins said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the nation's cities, Houston had the highest concentration
of smog over an 8-hour period in 1999, supporting reports last year
that said that city had surpassed Los Angeles as the urban center
with the most filthy air. The five highest smog concentrations
recorded last summer -- when smog is at its worst -- were all
recorded in the Houston area.

&HT;     NO GRIPING, PLEASE, ABOUT THE BASEBALL HALL OF FAME 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union

<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ Good for Carlton Fisk.
</P>
<P>
   Better for Tony Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all for those of us who don't have the stomach for yet
another year of complaints about the indignities and injustices
done to Perez. This time, the Baseball Writers Association of
America voted Fisk and Perez into the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Enshrinement into the Hall of Fame is the highest honor the
sport has to offer. It is not an entitlement. The Hall is a place
of honor for the greatest of the greatest. Just making it on to the
ballot is proof positive of a distinguished career.
</P>
<P>
   Why is it, then, that every No vote gets treated like a slap in
the face? Why should Fisk stew because he didn't get in last year _
his first on the ballot _ while Nolan Ryan, George Brett and Robin
Yount did? Why should anybody portray Perez's nine-year wait to get
voted in as some sort of cruel punishment?
</P>
<P>
   To me, the Hall of Fame should be so elitist, the Ivy League
looks inclusive by comparison. Perez was a terrific player, a
leader and cornerstone of Cincinnati's Big Red Machine of the
1970s. He has been a credit to the game, and only 17 players in
major-league history have driven in more runs over their careers.
</P>
<P>
   And he wouldn't have gotten my vote.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the inclusion of Perez isn't going to cause me to hold my
nose every time I enter the Cooperstown city limits. It's actually
possible to respect Perez, even admire him, without deeming him to
be Cooperstown material.
</P>
<P>
   One of Perez's contemporaries as a first baseman, Steve Garvey,
was in his eighth year on the ballot. When Perez was in his prime,
Garvey generally was considered the better all-around player.
Garvey got well less than one-half the Hall of Fame support as
Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Perez was a productive, but not dominant player whose career
spanned more than two decades. His being from Cuba has nothing to
do with the fact that he isn't ranked anywhere near the top 100 in
major-league history in the best two measures of offensive
production _ on-base percentage or slugging average. The likes of
Fred McGriff, David Justice, Jay Buhner and Zeke Bonura have higher
career slugging averages than Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Bert Blyleven was in his third year on the ballot. Blyleven is
22nd in big-league history in victories, third in strikeouts and
ninth in shutouts. He needed and everybody else on the ballot
needed at least 375 out of the 499 votes cast. He got a measly 87.
Should Blyleven and his supporters read something sinister into the
fact that he was born in the Netherlands?
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame case for Fisk was open-and-shut. Fisk hit more
home runs than any catcher in history. He was a standout defensive
player and handler of pitchers. He also gave baseball one of its
most memorable moments, clouting the 12th-inning home run that beat
Cincinnati in Game 6 of the 1975 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the strong support for Fisk raises questions
about what it takes to get the support of the voters. Consider two
of the candidates on the latest ballot. Both are contemporaries.
Both played the same position:
</P>
<P>
   Player A appeared in the majors from 1969-93. He batted .269
over his career with 376 home runs and 1,330 runs batted in. He
made 11 All-Star teams, won one Gold Glove and played in one
(losing) World Series. He had eight 20-homer seasons and drove in
100 runs twice.
</P>
<P>
   Player B appeared in the majors from 1974 to 1992. He batted
.262 over his career with 324 homers and 1,225 RBI. He made 11
All-Star teams, won three Gold Gloves and played in one (winning)
World Series. He had nine 20-homer seasons and drove in 100 runs
four times.
</P>
<P>
   Player A is Fisk.
</P>
<P>
   Player B is Gary Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk got 397 out of a possible 499 votes, Carter 248. If that
adds up, then somebody must have invented yet another new math. The
biggest knock against Carter is that he smiled too much, that he
was too cooperative with the media.
</P>
<P>
   Now consider the case of two sluggers on the latest ballot:
</P>
<P>
   Slugger A played in the majors from 1974-89. He had a .298
career batting average with 382 homers and 1,451 RBI. He had 2,452
hits in 16 seasons, with a .352 on-base average and .502 slugging
percentage. He led the league in home runs three times, RBI twice,
total bases four times, slugging twice and won a Most Valuable
Player award. He made eight All-Star teams, had 11 20-homer seasons
and drove in 100 runs eight times.
</P>
<P>
   Slugger B played in the majors from 1964-86. He had a .279
career batting average with 379 homers and 1,652 RBI. He had 2,732
hits in 23 seasons, with a .341 on-base average and .463 slugging
percentage. He never led the league in an offensive category or won
an MVP award. He made seven All-Star teams, had nine 20-homer
seasons and drove in 100 runs seven times.
</P>
<P>
   Player B is Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Player A is Jim Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Perez got 385 votes, Rice 257. Rice was a dominant, feared
player. The biggest knock against him is that he didn't smile
enough, that he was beyond uncooperative when it came to dealing
with the media.
</P>
<P>
   Good for Carlton Fisk and Tony Perez. The Hall of Fame is a hard
place to get into as anything but a paying customer. And it should
be. Membership is a privilege, not an entitlement.

 &HT;    New `enjoy' commercials seeking Coke Classic revival
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Imagine yourself inside a Coke bottle or pouring a
Coke that morphs into a giant waterfall.
</P>
<P>
   Watch a parrot, perched above a cafe bar, give a perfect
imitation of the soft drink being opened, poured and consumed.
</P>
<P>
   Hear young boys compare their first Coke experience to what
kissing a girl might be like.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Monday, you'll be doing just that as Coca-Cola begins a
national rollout of its new Classic commercials in hopes of putting
the pop back into droopy sales of its flagship brand.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-second ``enjoy'' TV spots replace the 7-year-old
``Always'' campaign, which went flat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advertising is a very strong part of the marketing mix, and it
has not been as strong in the past few years as we've been
accustomed to,'' said Bob Lovell, vice president of marketing for
Birmingham, Ala.-based Coca-Cola Bottling Company United, the
system's fourth-largest U.S. bottler. Lovell was in Atlanta on
Wednesday evening when Coke unveiled the commercials to its
bottlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like in winning football, with its emphasis on blocking
and tackling, the new ads return to the basics that built the brand
_ friends, family, fun, happiness, refreshment,'' Lovell said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Conway, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said
the company is also returning to its roots by trying to ``leave
lasting impressions with the viewer on the experience of drinking
Coca-Cola.''
</P>
<P>
   The spots do more than just associate the Classic brand with fun
events, as many soft drink ads do.
</P>
<P>
   They try to convey the physical attributes of the product _ the
popping sound of a bottle opening, the fizzle of carbonation and
the tingling sensation of the drink as it hits the back of the
throat. The ads do this while simultaneously attempting to connect
emotionally with consumers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, viewers of one spot are put inside a Coke bottle,
where they see different dance sequences, from hip-hop to merengue.
Dance is used as a metaphor for the emotions that can be stirred up
while drinking Coke. Then, very quickly, the viewer is brought out
of the bottle and into a hopping nightclub where the disc jockey
drinks a Coke.
</P>
<P>
   In another commercial, a Coke pops open, starts pouring out and
then immediately transforms into a Hawaiian waterfall, with a
teen-age boy riding it down. He plunges underwater into a trove of
Coke, grabs one and bursts through the surface to find his friends
drinking the soft drink and laughing at the head of another
waterfall.
</P>
<P>
   In an emotional spot, with an uplifting orchestral melody, kids
are throwing snowballs and catching snowflakes with their tongues.
The camera tightens on one of the flakes, destined for a young
girl's mouth. But just as it reaches her, the flake dissolves into
a Coke bottle. It's now about 10 years later, she's drinking the
last drop of a Coke on a beach with her friends. The snowflake was
just a distant and pleasant memory of times gone by.
</P>
<P>
   ``How successful these ads are is critical,'' said John Sicher,
editor and publisher of Beverage Digest. ``Coke Classic is the
company's biggest product. Its growth has been relatively slow in
recent years. It's important for Coke and Pepsi to get stronger
growth from their flagship colas.''
</P>
<P>
   No question about it, said the people behind the Coke ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to sell Coca-Cola,'' said Charles Frenette, the
company's chief marketing officer until Feb. 1, when he becomes
head of its European operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a marketing company,'' Frenette said. ``What we do is
give reasons to people to buy and sell our products. ... We want to
revitalize and rejuvenate growth in our flagship brand.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because the company expects Coke Classic to be the engine
of growth over an extended period. Recently, however, the opposite
has taken place, with non-cola brands growing considerably faster
than Coke percentagewise.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Coke Classic represented 46 percent of the
company's case sales of carbonated soft drinks in 1998, according
to Beverage Digest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very key to our success,'' said Lovell, the bottler.
</P>
<P>
   So Coca-Cola will be hitting the airwaves in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   Within a week of Monday's launch, 95 percent of the U.S.
population will have seen one of the new ads on TV, said Ian
Rowden, the company's advertising director.
</P>
<P>
   Ten spots will be aired over time, including a polar bear
commercial and an animated one featuring aliens and a Coke
spaceship.
</P>
<P>
   The spots, which will also be aired around the world, were
created by Leo Burnett and Edge Creative. Other agencies will
supplement the initial pool of ads, as well as adapt them to local
markets.
</P>

   ``It's an invitation, not a command,'' Frenette said.
</P>
<P>
   There also will be radio, print, Internet and billboard ads. On
radio, for example, there are a variety of musical styles,
everything from urban to country to rock.
</P>
<P>
   Coke officials would not say how much they're planning to spend
on the new campaign. For the first nine months of last year, the
company spent $95.6 million on its Classic media advertising in the
United States, according to Competitive Media Reporting. For all of
1998, it spent $115.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Will the new campaign work? Ron Wilson, president of
Philadelphia Coca-Cola Bottling Co., thinks so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bottlers were upbeat because the ads had a consistent
message,'' Wilson said after viewing the spots Wednesday at the
Georgia World Congress Center. ``I think they're going to better
connect with consumers. We're selling the uniqueness of Coke, and I
think we've gotten away from that in the past few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Sicher, of Beverage Digest, said only time will tell how
effective the new campaign will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``As with any soft drink ads, how successful they are will be
determined by the collective jury of the consumer,'' he said. ``We
probably won't know that verdict for a year.''

TAMPA BAY'S KING IS RARE ROOKIE QB STARTING IN PLAYOFFS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Shaun King spent most of the
season waiting his turn. Now, it is history that awaits him.
</P>
<P>
   King, who has won four of five starts, will become only the
sixth rookie quarterback to start a playoff game when he takes the
field against the Washington Redskins tomorrow at Raymond James
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   A rookie quarterback has never started in the Super Bowl. In
fact, since the 1970 NFL-AFL merger, rookie quarterbacks are 1-5 in
the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even guys who went to good teams _ the \RJohn\S Elways and the
\RDan\S Marinos _ didn't really take over and take their team to
the playoffs their first year,'' Tampa Bay coach Tony Dungy said.
``So, it's something that doesn't happen all the time, but I think
the circumstances were really right for Shaun. He got to sit and
watch and learn for half a year, got a chance to practice and be in
the mix, and then, as the team started to play better, that's when
he stepped in and it kind of worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Marinovich was the most recent rookie quarterback to start
a playoff game. His Los Angeles Raiders lost to the Kansas City
Chiefs, 10-6, in a 1991 AFC divisional playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   The only rookie quarterback to win a playoff game was Pat Haden,
who led the Los Angeles Rams to a 14-12 victory against the Cowboys
in a 1976 divisional playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   King, 22, shows no fear at his date with history.
</P>
<P>
   Nicknamed ``Smoothie King'' by receiver Bert Emanuel, King won
his first NFL start _ on ``Monday Night Football'', no less. Maybe
King has forgotten how to lose.
</P>
<P>
   As a starter, he has lost only once since Nov. 16, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``No nerves. No nerves,'' said King, who led Tulane to an
undefeated season in 1998. ``I know I have a job to do. I'll go out
and do my best. I'm not afraid to mess up. I'm not afraid to fail.
My father has a saying, `If you're worried, you're not praying,'
and I pray a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   King has been the answer to Buccaneers' fans prayers.
</P>
<P>
   He was not transformed into a Tampa Bay hero. He was born into
the role.
</P>
<P>
   King, a St. Petersburg, Fla., native, grew up a Buccaneers' fan.
He dreamed of playing for his hometown NFL team while throwing for
more than 5,000 yards and 50 touchdowns in his final two seasons at
Gibbs High School, just across the bay from One Buc Place.
</P>
<P>
   King was selected by the Buccaneers in the second round of the
1999 draft, the sixth quarterback taken. He began the season as a
typical rookie quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Third on the depth chart, he spent Sunday afternoons wearing a
baseball cap and charting plays.
</P>
<P>
   But injuries to starter Trent Dilfer and backup Eric Zeier saw
King promoted to the front line during the team's Nov. 28 game at
Seattle. In 5 1/2 starts, King completed 89 of 146 passes for 875
yards, with seven touchdowns and four interceptions. If he had
thrown enough passes to qualify, King's 82.4 rating would rank
eighth in the NFC, ahead of Troy Aikman and Brett Favre.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a Cinderella year for him for what he's done for
us,'' Buccaneers quarterbacks coach Clyde Christensen said.
</P>
<P>
   When the clock strikes midnight tomorrow, King hopes the slipper
still fits.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ Republican Senator John McCain, after months of
focusing mostly on New Hampshire, is preparing to spend millions of
dollars on advertisements in several states with later primaries.
Former Senator Bill Bradley, who for months insisted he wouldn't
sling ``darts,'' has begun throwing them regularly at his
Democratic opponent, Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   With 2 1/2 until the N.H. primary, the two men are carefully
reworking their strategies and beginning to look beyond the Granite
State. While they, like all the candidates, have political
mountains to climb before the vote, and they continue to trail
Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Gore by wide margins in
national polls, their actions demonstrate a new degree of
confidence in their standing here.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign, for its part, is concerned enough about
McCain that it is for the first time beginning to play down the
importance of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Hampshire is a very critical state, obviously, but I'm not
going to say how important it is,'' said US Senator Judd Gregg of
New Hampshire, Bush's top elected backer here. ``That's a question
for one of those national wags. As wonderful as New Hampshire is,
carrying New Hampshire in the general election is not going to get
you the nomination,'' Gregg said, turning the conventional wisdom
about the importance of the Granite State on its head.
</P>
<P>
   Often at this stage of the primary, candidates such as Bradley
and McCain would be launching rounds of negative advertisements
that attack the national front-runners, seeking to boost the odds
of a win in New Hampshire that might give them momentum heading
into other states. But so far both men have resisted negative ads,
running instead on their personalities and highly detailed
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no percentage in it for us,'' McCain strategist
Michael Murphy said, referring to negative ads. ``This is not a
campaign where everything depends on New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, in an interview, said that McCain is already spending
heavily in South Carolina, which holds the second major primary, on
Feb. 19. He said McCain plans to spend $1 million on advertisements
in Michigan, which holds a Feb. 22 primary, and soon will begin
spending significant amounts of money in Washington and Virginia,
two states that have received little attention but which hold
significant contests on Feb. 29.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bradley, who appeared jointly last month to
demonstrate their commitment to campaign finance overhaul, are
making a risky move by deciding not to run the usual attack ads.
Bush's senior adviser, Thomas Rath, said that he expects two-thirds
of voters to make up their minds in the week leading up to the
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Rath, who has advised numerous campaigns in past primaries, is
preaching caution. ``I know a lot of guys who went to bed Saturday
thinking they would be president, and who woke up Wednesday (after
the primary) drafting their withdrawal statement.''
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, a Quinnipiac College survey released this week
shows Bradley ahead of Gore in New Hampshire by 10 points, and
McCain ahead of Bush by 9 points. Other surveys suggest the race is
considerably tighter in New Hampshire and also that Bush and Gore
maintain large leads in national match-ups.
</P>
<P>
   The danger for Bush is that in some ways he is running a
cautious campaign here, preferring to remain vague on some key
issues. For example, Gregg made his comment playing down the
importance of New Hampshire at a press conference in which he
repeatedly bashed McCain's plans to save Social Security. But when
he was asked to explain how Bush would rescue the retirement
program, Gregg admitted that the Texas governor so far has issued
no plan. Would Bush unveil one before New Hampshire voters go to
the polls?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Gregg said. ``I suspect he will at some point
in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The week's schedule of candidate appearances said much about the
Republican race: McCain has been here for four straight days of
back-to-back forums and town meetings, while Bush Thursday appeared
for a couple of quick events and one town meeting Thursday night.
Bush aides said, however, that the candidate will spend 15 days in
New Hampshire during January, noting that McCain has more time here
because he is not actively campaigning in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Bradley, who has been visibly irked at
Gore during their debates, wavers between his usual calm,
professorial self and an occasional eagerness to deliver jabs to
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has taken to describing himself as the underdog in New
Hamsphire, has often been the aggressor in recent weeks, attacking
Bradley's health care plan and questioning his support for Iowa
farmers. That has posed a dilemma for Bradley, who has often
pledged to run ``a different kind of campaign,'' built around a
positive vision and largely free of the rhetorical fisticuffs that,
Bradley believes, alienate the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you can't be positive about what you're going to do, you
tend to be negative about what the other person does,'' Bradley
told a New Hampshire audience last week.
</P>
<P>
   By the standards of a typical primary campaign, Bradley has been
unusually gentle -- especially for an underdog.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two weeks before the January 24 Iowa caucus, Bradley
trails Gore by 21 points, according to a Des Moines Register poll
published Saturday. While it is true that local caucuses are
volatile gatherings and the results often hard to predict, Bradley
has been remarkably calm in the face of likely defeat, preferring
low-key events to taking on Gore. In Iowa earlier this week,
Bradley conducted two teach-ins with elementary school children,
visited other schools and struck no strong new themes in his few
appearances before voting-age audiences. In a talk at an elementary
school in rural, western Iowa Monday, and again in a easy-going
discussion with inner-city fourth and fifth graders here Thursday,
Bradley bore a closer resemblance to Mr. Rogers than a presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But at other times this week Bradley has been tougher,
criticizing Gore's record on farm policy, tobacco, and abortion
rights. For instance, Bradley derided Gore's role in the Clinton
administration's farm policy, saying that when a 1996 agriculture
bill signed by Clinton left small farmers in peril, ``Al Gore did
nothing about it.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, Bradley has seemed to contradict his own positions.
After complaining for days that Gore was dredging up Bradley's
Senate votes from years ago, for instance, Bradley called the
media's attention to a handful of pro-tobacco votes and quotations
made by Gore -- all more than a decade old.
</P>
<P>
   As is often the case, Bradley did not personally utter harsh
criticisms of the Vice President. Instead, Bradley aides
distributed a handout questioning Gore's record.
</P>
<P>
   This led Gore to accuse Bradley of succumbing to politics as
usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he wouldn't do that, and I guess he's changed his
mind,'' Gore told reporters, whose stories prominently noted the
contrast between Bradley's positive rhetoric and his increasingly
negative message.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who is not actively campaigning in Iowa, has endured a
tough couple of weeks, spending much time on the defensive this
month explaining why he wrote letters to the Federal Communications
Commission urging a decision on a matter raised by a contributor
who also was providing corporate jets to his campaign. McCain
responded by saying he did nothing wrong and was a victim of a
system that has to be changed.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has also been the subject of negative ads by independent
groups. One group, the Americans for Tax Reform, says McCain's
proposal to eliminate unregulated ``soft money'' would amount to a
violation of free speech. Another group has criticized McCain for
making a joke at the expense of people with Alzheimer's disease.
But McCain isn't about to change his style. On the day the
Alzheimer's ad began running this week, he joked about overweight
people, describing sarcastically how much he loved to fly in a
center seat between ``two large Americans.''

<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ Taking his campaign from town-hall meetings to
the state Capitol, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., told the New
Hampshire Legislature on Thursday that if he is elected president,
he will create a cabinet post for a ``reform czar'' to oversee his
efforts ``to restore a government of, by and for the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 10-minute speech that mentioned Bart Simpson, Henry Luce,
Ronald Reagan and Harry Truman, McCain, a presidential candidate,
told the packed chamber of America's oldest surviving statehouse
that he would veto pork-barrel bills and force the federal
government to fully fund state mandates on special education,
health care, immigration and the environment. He also hailed
publicly financed vouchers for private schools, saying, ``vouchers
means choice, and choice means freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You are the victims of pork-barrel politics in Washington, and
it must stop,'' McCain said to the legislators, who greeted him
with standing ovations. ``When our politics are perceived as
corrupted by money and lies, trust is lost to cynicism. When our
government has been taken from us by special interests and
big-dollar donors, as it has been, pride is lost to shame.''
</P>
<P>
   The anti-establishment tone was familiar, but it was the first
time McCain had suggested a cabinet-level position _ akin to the
drug czar, the director of the White House Office of Drug Control
Policy _ to coordinate efforts to reform government and the
campaign finance system. That person would kick-start changes in
the tax code, the Department of Education and the military, for
starters, McCain said, and heighten the visibility of the reform
issue overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must reform the institutions of government to catch up with
the changes of the age,'' he said after the speech. Asked whether
Sen. Russell D. Feingold, D-Wis., his partner on campaign finance
legislation, might be a candidate for the new position, he laughed
and said, ``that wouldn't be a bad idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls show McCain leading Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
among likely Republican voters as this state prepares to hold the
campaign's first primary on Feb. 1. When McCain started his speech
on Thursday, he had 75 endorsements in the 410-member state
Legislature; he picked up four more before the day was done. Bush
is backed by 61 New Hampshire state legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier on Thursday, over breakfast with 15 police chiefs from
rural New Hampshire, McCain said states should receive federal
block grants for law enforcement, rather than money earmarked for
the hiring of more police officers. And he said every public school
and library being wired to the Internet should have software
installed to filter out offensive material.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the chiefs, who often respond to alarms themselves
because their departments are so tiny, said they had not bothered
to seek the federal grants because they were daunted by the
detailed applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``All our communities have New York City expectations with
Mayberry R.F.D. budgets,'' David J. Collum, who heads a
seven-member force in Rindge, N.H., told the senator.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging the pressures, McCain asked the chief of a
department of four, ``What happens when vacation time comes? I hope
we don't tell the bad guys.''

 &HT;    WestPoint Stevens maintains low profile while `exploring'
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ WestPoint Stevens is keeping its ownership plans under
wraps.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's largest maker of sheets and towels has maintained a
low profile on Wall Street following an announcement in November
that it's exploring a merger, sale or recapitalization.
</P>
<P>
   The West Point, Ga.-based manufacturer said at the time it
wasn't in discussions and hadn't received any offers. The company
has declined to discuss the status since then.
</P>
<P>
   Fed up with its lagging stock, WestPoint Stevens hired Merrill
Lynch to advise it on alternatives, but investors may not be that
excited about the prospects. The company has outperformed its
largest competitors, Pillowtex (PTX) and Springs Industries (SMI),
in earnings growth, but its shares had lost about half their value
in the six months prior to the November announcement. The stock
since then has continued its decline, hitting a 52-week low of
$15.18 3/4 on Dec. 20.
</P>
<P>
   The stock closed Thursday at $17.25, down 18 3/4 cents.
</P>
<P>
   WestPoint Stevens is expected to report earnings Feb 10.
Analysts anticipate a profit of about 57 cents a share. That
compares with 49 cents per share in the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said a likely outcome is for Chairman and Chief
Executive Holcombe Green Jr. to take over ownership of the company,
which had a market value of about $921 million Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, Holcombe Green has repeatedly said he wanted
to own the company,'' said analyst Kay Norwood of Wachovia
Securities. Green took the helm at WestPoint Stevens in 1992 when
its former chief, William Farley, lost control of the company
during a bankruptcy restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   Other possibilities include a purchase by a foreign company or a
large non-textile company that can afford to expand WestPoint
Stevens' business, analysts said. A merger with domestic rivals
Pillowtex or Spring Industries, however, could create antitrust
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   If WestPoint Stevens is looking for outside involvement, it's
likely trying to round up equity investors, Norwood said. But that
won't be easy. The U.S. textile industry, plagued by cheap imports
from overseas competitors, has been a risky arena. Profitability in
general has been lackluster, and textile companies tend to be
heavily leveraged.
</P>
<P>
   The company has been trying to position itself more as a
consumer products company than a textile maker, Norwood added. In
addition to its Ralph Lauren line, WestPoint Stevens markets brands
including Martex, Utica and Vellux at department stores and
discount chains.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are looking for consistent top-line and bottom-line
growth, which WestPoint Stevens and other textile makers can't
guarantee, she said. ``They sell fashion items, and if the economy
takes a downturn, people won't buy towels or sheets.''

MONKEY BORN FROM EMBRYO DIVIDED BY SCIENTISTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   By GINA KOLATA    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists in Oregon have divided an eight-cell monkey embryo
into quarters, creating identical quadruplet embryos. One of them
survived and resulted in the birth of a baby monkey.
</P>
<P>
   In their report, which is being published Friday in the journal
Science, Dr. Gerald P. Schatten of the Oregon Regional Primate
Research Center in Beaverton and his colleagues say this is the
first time that embryos of primates were deliberately subdivided,
resulting in the birth of a live offspring. The splitting of
embryos can occur naturally when an early embryo spontaneously
divides in half, producing identical twins, or thirds or quarters
early in development. Each piece can then develop as an independent
embryo.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two decades, scientists have mimicked this process
by dividing early embryos from other animals in the laboratory and
then implanting them in females, where they develop normally.
</P>
<P>
   The new study involved 107 rhesus monkey embryos that were
divided into anywhere from two to nine pieces to form 368 embryos.
In addition to the monkey that was born after an embryo had been
divided into four, the investigators say they also have four
pregnancies under way with embryos that had been split in half. Two
of those split embryos will be identical twins if they survive
until birth, which is expected in May.
</P>
<P>
   Schatten's group did not achieve nearly the success that was
accomplished with other animals.
</P>
<P>
   The first successful embryo splitting was in 1978, when Dr.
Steen Willadsen, an embryologist in Windermere, Fla., divided sheep
embryos in two. Sixty percent to 80 percent of the split embryos
survived, resulting in the birth of live lambs. When Willadsen
divided the embryos in quarters, half survived; when he divided
them in eighths, 5 percent to 10 percent went on to become lambs.
</P>
<P>
   Willadsen repeated the work, with the same success rate, in
cows, goats, horses and pigs.
</P>
<P>
   Schatten said that while the success rate with monkey embryos
had not been as great as with other species, the importance of his
work was that he had established that embryos could be divided. The
next step, he said, will be to create identical twin and quadruplet
monkeys to study the influence of genes on disease susceptibility.
He also wants to study the possibility of using embryos as a source
of cells that could be used for replacement parts in diseases like
diabetes or Parkinson's.
</P>
<P>
   ``AIDS, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, cancer, heart attacks and
strokes all could be moved to the cured list if we understood the
genetic basis of the disease,'' Schatten said.
</P>
<P>
   But some said the monkey results so far were a far cry from
cures for these diseases. There is the question, for example, of
why so few of the divided embryos survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either the primate embryos are not as suitable as sheep
embryos for artificially producing genetically identical
offspring,'' Willadsen said, ``or the techniques used were not
sufficiently good.''

SPORTS COLUMN: PLAYING   BILLIONAIRE   ROULETTE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What is there in the victory of Robert Wood Johnson IV over
Charles F. Dolan that touches off the urge to shout,
``Hip-hip-hooray?''
</P>
<P>
   Normally, we lumpen proles are not inclined to root for any
billionaire with an IV after his name, since it implies continuity
and power, big bucks begetting big bucks. But in this struggle for
control of the Jets, good old Woody came off as a man of the
people, an outsider, a lone wolf, with no looming Vaderian menace.
</P>
<P>
   Woody does not own other sports teams. Woody does not control
what is piped into our television sets. Woody does not raise our
cable rates. He just sells bandages. Good old Woody.
</P>
<P>
   These media-electronic-internet-entertainment conglomerates,
they own everything. They give you the willies.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but now television has the Bomb. CBS, the company
of Edward R. Murrow, used its technology to superimpose its own
corporate logo over an NBC logo in Times Square on New Year's Eve.
It was Dan Rathers' greatest fantasy. His own network essentially
beamed him up.
</P>
<P>
   The ramifications are endless in this high-tech infotainment
industry that used to go by the quaint name of journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Every one of these giants has ulterior motives, hidden agendas.
AOL, a company that carries e-mail, is fixing to merge with
Time-Warner, a company that currently employs John Rocker and
Isaiah Rider. You don't know what machinations can come of this.
</P>
<P>
   No longer do we have owners like Horace Stoneham of the old New
York Giants, who merely wanted to lock the manager in his dingy
office in the dingier Polo Grounds and drink the night away with
him. Those, we can now see clearly, were the good old days.
</P>
<P>
   The billionaires are restless. They keep making more money, and
they want to own all the teams. Some of them want to own teams for
fun and profit. Some of them want to own teams for control and
profit. There is a difference.
</P>
<P>
   The march of the billionaires goes on. With all due respect to
madcap Tennessee laterals and the endless backing-and-forthing of
hockey and basketball, the best action this winter involves rich
people jockeying for position.
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner, or maybe his body double, fumes at Nets'
games. His YankeeNet empire will buy the Devils one of these hours,
despite John McMullen's obfuscations. The poor Islanders may yet be
liberated from the Curse of the Millstones. The Mets will be
purchased, one of these months, by the would-be man for all
seasons, Charles F. Dolan himself.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the football team Dolan wanted to buy. As soon as
Woody was anointed by the National Football League, he did what any
new owner of the Jets would do. He gravitated directly to Bill
Parcells and said, `Help!'
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Bill Belichick had enough of living in the swirling
wake of the big man who is more shark than tuna. Thursday, the
Battling Bills attended a hearing as the NFL attempts to sort out
Belichick's contract with the Jets. Ultimately, Commissioner Paul
Tagliabue will knock a few heads together and say, ``Get out of
here, you knuckleheads.''
</P>
<P>
   It may cost a draft choice of two, but Belichick will get back
to New England and Parcells will stay on a while with the Jets. How
can you say no to Woody?
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue has been busy, first whipping the owners into shape to
accept Johnson over Dolan. Since both these chaps have no shortage
of money, what is there about the Dolan bid that has caused him to
be turned down three _ count 'em, three _ times?
</P>
<P>
   The NFL, which likes to control everything from the length of
socks to the equitable distribution of network swag, had qualms
about controlling Dolan. No matter what the man might earnestly put
down in writing about using only his personal fortune on the Jets,
he still owns Cablevision and much of the Knicks and the Rangers,
and that sounded like mischief to the NFL. This is one of those
times when the normally staid league takes on the aura of a
latter-day attack-terrier trust-buster. The NFL lives with Jerry
Jones. The NFL lives with Al Davis. But neither of these rascals is
aligned with a cable company that own teams in other sports.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has won its noble rear-guard action against the forces
of synergy. But don't forget: Television has the Bomb. One of these
days Tagliabue will look in the mirror and, to his horror, see the
grim logo of Microsoft or AOL Time Warner or Cablevision
superimposed on his face.
</P>
<P>
   One of these giants is going to swallow the league whole. In the
meantime, let us have some fanfare for the common man, good old
Woody. &QL;

 &HT;    Microsoft invests in site-hosting business
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Interland, a fast-growing downtown Atlanta Web
site-hosting firm, said it has received a $5 million equity
investment from Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft will invest $7.5 million more should Interland file
for an initial public offering of its stock.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is the second major investment in Interland in the past
two months. Crest Communications Holdings, Boulder Ventures and
BancBoston Capital invested $20 million in Interland in December.
It was the company's first formal round of venture capital.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft investment came after months of discussions, said
Ken Gavranovic, Interland's 29 year-old founder and president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cemented the fact that Microsoft believes in the company
and we both enjoy working together,'' Gavranovic said.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft deal does not restrict Interland to developing Web
sites on Microsoft platforms, but about 70 percent of its
customers' sites already are supported by Microsoft software and
servers.
</P>
<P>
   Gavranovic said he plans to use the recent investments to help
fund a national and international sales expansion. Europe is a ripe
market for American Web hosting firms because bandwidth is cheaper
here, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company hosts Web sites for more than 70,000 small- to
medium-sized businesses, ranging from Outback Steakhouse to Trees
Atlanta. Businesses pay between $20 per month and thousands of
dollars per month for Interland to host their site. Prices vary
depending on the complexity of the site and the number of expected
visitors. The average monthly charge is between $30 and $40.
</P>
<P>
   The company was started in in January 1998, when Gavranovic
moved to Atlanta from south Florida. He said he chose Atlanta after
learning of its estensive telecommunications infrastructure. Then
he went online and researched U.S. Census figures to learn about
cost-of-living and doing business, as well as the skill level of
area workers.
</P>
<P>
   Gavranovic chose a building at the corner of Marietta and
Peachtree streets for its proximity to high-speed fiber-optic
cables, an Olympic legacy. Interland has since expanded into seven
floors of Centennial Tower, at Spring and Marietta streets.
</P>
<P>
   Interland grew in 12 months from 48 employees to more than 300.
The company has averaged 6,000 new Web-hosting customer a month
since July.
</P>
<P>
   Interland's inside and field-based sales force competes against
companies such as Verio, MindSpring Enterprises, Bell Atlantic and
AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Gavranovic has been involved in technology to a high degree from
a young age. As a Texas high school student, he wrote an accounting
software program for a local Galveston hotel. He said he received a
few room nights as compensation, but it was enough to whet his
entrepreneurial appetite.

 &HT;    Scientific-Atlanta may spin off unit
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Scientific-Atlanta is considering spinning off a
subsidiary that makes the software powering its digital cable TV
set-top boxes.
</P>
<P>
   A spinoff of the subsidiary, called PowerTV, could be a bonanza
for Scientific-Atlanta. Companies similar to PowerTV have garnered
market valuations in the billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Liberate Technology, which also makes set-top
operating software, has a market capitalization of $4.4 billion, or
nearly twice that of Scientific-Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In a spinoff, Scientific-Atlanta would sell shares in PowerTV to
the public, retaining a stake itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``A spinoff is one way that the company could maximize
shareholder value,'' according to analyst Greg Mesniaeff of
Robinson-Humphrey in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific-Atlanta executives declined to comment on reports
that they have begun serious talks this week about spinning off
PowerTV.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to take the subsidiary public during the second half
of this year, according to reports in industry trade journals.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives did confirm Thursday that James McDonald, the
company's president and chief executive, told a gathering of
analysts at a recent industry trade show that it was possible
PowerTV could be spun off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does make sense,'' says Mesniaeff. ``A spinoff of PowerTV
would allow Scientific-Atlanta management to focus on its core
competency.''
</P>
<P>
   That competency is building and maintaining networks that
transmit cable TV signals.
</P>
<P>
   Right now the company is trying to establish a new product line
called the Explorer 2000. The system enables cable TV operators to
offer high-resolution television, e-mail, Web browsing and
high-speed access to the Internet. So far, Scientific-Atlanta has
sold the Explorer to more than 70 cable TV systems nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   A key part of the system is its operating system, developed by
PowerTV. Scientific-Atlanta owns 80 percent of the software
developer, based in the Silicon Valley town of Cupertino, Calif.
PowerTV also has an e-mail reader and a Web browser that works
through digital cable TV systems.
</P>
<P>
   PowerTV has made its software compatible with other digital
systems, including that sold by Scientific-Atlanta rival General
Instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Such compatibility gives PowerTV the potential to have a market
larger than just Scientific-Atlanta.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The stock of Mothernature.com, an Internet retailer specializing
in natural health products, has lost nearly half its value since
the company went public in mid-December. No wonder that its chief
executive, Michael Barach, recently announced plans to try
something new.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he spent $30 million on marketing but attracted fewer
than 250,000 customers. This year, he plans to link up with health
maintenance organizations, seeking promotion by the HMOs in return
for discounts to their members _ a move he hopes will shave 10
percent off his advertising budget while providing a steep jump in
shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Though Barach is loath to acknowledge that investors forced his
hand, he readily acknowledges that the time for Web retailers to
throw money around first and justify it later is coming to an end.
``The year 2000,'' he said, ``is the year that e-commerce companies
have to prove their business models work.''
</P>
<P>
   For almost a year, Internet companies have had a sweet ride from
investors, public and private, willing to accept enormous losses on
promises of great future returns. But signs indicate that the
climate of unlimited forgiveness is changing, that imagined future
earnings may not justify sky-high stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Though the buzz this week about America Online's plan to acquire
Time Warner can make everything electronic seem ascendant, AOL is a
relatively old Internet company with steady profits. As inspiring
as the triumph by AOL's leader, Steve Case, may be to them, many
executives of younger Internet companies find themselves under a
microscope.
</P>
<P>
   Dot-coms, particularly those that serve consumer markets, are
suddenly feeling the pressure to account much better for how they
spend dollars. Tighter capital flow is already affecting everything
from advertising strategies to the supply chain, and it even means
that e-commerce companies will start developing short-term game
plans aimed at turning a profit.
</P>
<P>
   The financial markets have signaled a tougher stance in the last
two weeks. The Nasdaq has been depressed since the beginning of the
year, in part because investors have been selling off e-commerce
stocks. Amazon.com, the Web's mightiest and highest-profile player,
delivered strong sales growth over the holidays, but its share
price was hammered when it announced that fourth-quarter losses
would not shrink. Value America, once a $2 billion stock market
darling, announced last week that it would dismiss half its staff
to stop cash hemorrhaging.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is becoming less and less willing to fund third-
and fourth-tier players in sectors where first-tier players have
been established,'' said Henry Blodget, an analyst with Merrill
Lynch who made his reputation by being outrageously (and correctly)
bullish about Amazon's stock. ``It will make capital much more
difficult to get, where it has been virtually free before.''
</P>
<P>
   Most investor scorn is being focused on virtual stores that sell
products directly to consumers; Bluefly.com, a clothing retailer,
and Drugstore.com are among such companies that are down for the
year. Analysts say that that market is overcrowded and that the
explosive growth in new Internet users is slowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once it was a green pasture, and now there are 150 cows all
competing for five blades of grass,'' Blodget said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, disappointments were plentiful this holiday season
as dot-coms spent cash by the bucketloads but did not produce
proportional customers or revenue. And merchandise returns, which
can eat up 10 to 15 percent of such sales, are still being
processed.
</P>
<P>
   Even companies that delivered the requisite exponential growth
in sales are being punished for falling short in areas that have
long been the bane of traditional merchants. Among the factors that
angered investors at Amazon, for example, was its overstocked
inventories for Christmas; much of that extra merchandise will now
have to be sold at steep markdowns, which could compound losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This holiday period has marked a very important transition for
how Wall Street views e-commerce companies,'' said David Readerman,
director of Internet strategy at Thomas Weisel Partners. Web site
traffic growth used to be the only measurement that mattered for
the virtual retailers, Readerman said, ``but now they are going to
be held accountable to the same level of service and planning as
traditional retailers.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It is not just the public markets that are beginning to watch
the bottom line. In Silicon Valley, e-commerce companies that sell
directly to consumers are suddenly finding that they have lost
luster as venture capital firms madly chase the next hottest thing
_ like companies that solve Web infrastructure problems and
e-commerce companies that sell primarily to other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is 50 to 100 percent harder to get backing'' for sites that
sell to consumers than it was six months ago, said Fred Grauer,
general partner of Angel Investors, a premier venture capital firm.
He says venture capital is shifting away from the
business-to-consumer market because start-ups have to spend so much
on advertising just to make their names known.
</P>
<P>
   Some fallout is already apparent. Cookexpress.com, a fancy food
delivery site, has suspended operations until new financing is
available. And in recent weeks the crowded online-beauty market saw
a major contraction, as better-financed sites gobbled up weaker
players. Jasmin.com, a new fragrance site, for example, was bought
by Ashford.com, a luxury goods site. Beauty.com was snapped up by
Drugstore.com.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, with more venture capital than ever chasing business
opportunities, the well will not run completely dry. But even those
consumer Internet merchants who are getting financing are finding
that they must hand over a larger stake for the same amount of
cash. ``In absolute terms it is not hard to get money, but you have
to give away more of the company to get the $20 million,'' said
David Cowan of Bessemer Venture Partners, a firm based in Menlo
Park, Calif., that has backed players like eToys and Bluenile.com.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And as the e-commerce companies come back from Christmas looking
for new infusions of cash, they are finding that venture
capitalists are asking hard questions about issues previously
reserved for paleolithic retailers _ issues like gross margins,
inventory control and the efficacy of an advertising dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they spent $30 million on advertising on the national TV
networks,'' said Jim Breyer, managing partner of Accel Partners,
``instead of proven measures for getting customers like
cross-branding and cross-promoting, we would be highly concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Advertising companies say they are sensing a shift in the wind.
``It seemed crazy all the way through December,'' said Brian
Hurley, a principal at Grant, Scott &AMP; Hurley, a San Francisco-based
ad firm, which gets a majority of its revenue from dot-coms.
``Then, like a clear day after a storm, in January people were
saying, `Hey, we spent a tremendous amount of money but what did we
get?' We don't get the sense they will cut their budget in half,
but they will be looking for the return that much sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``One client has said we are not as interested in a national
presence, but want to concentrate on five or six markets, which
follows a more traditional retail route,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear what the market disenchantment with e-retailers
portends for other areas of the Web that are hot. Virtual merchants
that sell products and services exclusively to other businesses are
now favored by investors who see that model as underserved and
potentially more safely lucrative. But many analysts say that this
relatively young group of companies will inevitably face more
scrutiny. ``In six months to a year from now,'' Readerman said,
``something will happen in business-to-business that will
disillusion investors there, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Another sign of the changes in Silicon Valley's thinking about
consumer e-commerce companies is the red-hot popularity of
partnerships with big-name traditional retailers. ``Before, it was
enough to be smart going after an attractive niche,'' said Mark
Goldstein, chief executive of Bluelight.com, a joint venture by
Kmart and Yahoo. ``Now everyone wants a multibillion-dollar
strategic partner throwing their heft behind the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The advantages to such a pairing, once shunned as prehistoric
thinking, are now obvious. Since big retailers are already
household names, joint operations can attract customers at a
fraction of the cost of a start-up. In addition, big retailers can
buy in volume and have sophisticated supply chains that enable them
to purchase inventory at much less than tiny stand-alone dot-coms
can.
</P>
<P>
   Breyer, whose firm, Accel, signed a deal to help run Wal-Mart's
site, praised his new partners for having ``very significant buying
capabilities, very strong distribution and warehousing expertise,
and a phenomenal worldwide brand.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, in what might be a neat summation of the new current
of thinking for the industry: ``The goal for Wal-Mart.com is to
build a profitable leading business. It is not a money-losing
proposition.''

seen a campaign more focused on the issues. At this very moment,
John McCain and George W. Bush are trading ferocious faxes about
whether it's better to expand the 15 percent tax bracket or create
a new one at 10 percent. Turn on TV and you'll find the Democratic
candidates arguing whether Bill Bradley's health care plan has a
cap or a weighted average.
</P>
<P>
   I hope you're happy, people.
</P>
<P>
   This is what you wanted, right? A dignified race, where
candidates take the high road. A campaign so focused on policy that
we are not allowed to ask Bradley what his favorite color is, or
probe for details about Bush's lost years.
</P>
<P>
   The other night at a Republican debate in South Carolina, a
reporter asked the candidates to name their biggest mistakes.
Picking your own worst error isn't very threatening _ Bush always
says it was letting the Texas Rangers trade Sammy Sosa. But the
audience practically booed the poor woman off the stage. She's
prying! Let's get back to the issues! Tell us some more about the
International Monetary Fund!
</P>
<P>
   They were probably worried that she was going after those old
cocaine rumors, but it's been ages since this campaign went
anywhere near tawdry gossip. If this is the age of tabloid sleaze,
I'd hate to see the new Puritanism. Way back in 1964, when the
media were supposed to be in their don't-ask-don't-tell mode, and
Nelson Rockefeller was trying to take the Republican nomination
away from Barry Goldwater, all anybody could talk about was how
Rockefeller had left his first wife and married a much younger
woman. (New Hampshire Republicans rebelled against their options
and picked Henry Cabot Lodge, the ambassador to Vietnam, who was
neither in the country nor on the ballot. You have to love this
state.)
</P>
<P>
   This year the Republican challenger is John McCain, whose
marital history is much the same as Rockefeller's, albeit more
action-packed. But nobody ever brings it up, except to praise the
candidate for taking the blame for wrecking his first marriage.
</P>
<P>
   It's regarded as a show of principle when Bradley refuses to
reveal his favorite movie, best friend or religion. He did loosen
up enough to identify his favorite dessert (pecan pie), a question
that was apparently unintrusive enough for every candidate except
Alan Keyes, who declined to answer. Virtually everybody else picked
some variation on the theme of ice cream. This is not a
particularly helpful piece of information, but I must admit it came
as a relief after the thing about the weighted averages.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the candidates avoid reporters, but they all take
questions from the voters, whose concerns, they say, are more
serious. The residents of the early primary states have been
invited to dozens and dozens of town meetings, where Al Gore will
beg them to probe further into his feelings about the Superfund, or
McCain will volunteer all the instances when his integrity was
compromised by the lack of campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Having taken advantage of all these opportunities, the voters in
Iowa and New Hampshire are beginning to make up their minds. They
are voting, it turns out, on personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the whole wife thing that clinched it for me,'' a New
Hampshire teacher who's voting for Bush told The Times' Richard
Berke. The Texas governor won her support when he passed up a
debate in order to escort his spouse to an awards banquet.
``Besides,'' she added, ``I like his dad.''
</P>
<P>
   George W. supporters form a vast and diverse cross-section of
this great nation, including not only people who liked his dad but
also people who liked his mom, and a sizable minority who are fond
of the whole darned family. Meanwhile, a lot of independents are
telling reporters they could go for either McCain or Bradley
because they both seem honest. On a policy basis this is like
saying that you could add either grenadine or Tabasco sauce to the
recipe because they both look red.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign and the voters seem to be inhabiting different
dimensions, but you don't hear any grumbling on Main Street about
how the candidates ought to drop all this darned substance. Most
people seem pretty content about the way things are going. You
can't help wondering, though, if the public secretly regards
debates as just a good way to keep the politicians off the streets.

GORE MAKES LITTLE HEADWAY IN COURTING IOWA FARMERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: New Jersey, Iowa)  (See also IOWA-OUTLOOK) 
(dal) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SLOAN, Iowa _ Vice President Al Gore on Thursday appealed for
support from Iowa farmers and staged an event that attacked his
opponent, former Sen. Bill Bradley, as unconcerned with the
problems of American agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore used the well-scripted meeting to promote his own
candidacy, however, local farmers used the occasion to emphasize to
Gore their own difficulties and their dissatisfaction with the
Clinton-Gore administration. Afterward, many of the farmers
grumbled that they were not happy with any of the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing blue jeans and a denim shirt, Gore stood center stage in
a barn near this tiny town in western Iowa and denounced what he
described as the ``deadly threat'' facing America's family farms.
Some farmers said it sounded odd coming from a man who has helped
run the country for the last seven years.
</P>
<P>
   The message that Gore knows Iowa's concerns best is being
reinforced in new television and radio commercials with a
testimonial by Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the floods hit in '93, Al Gore came through for us,''
Harkin says in one commercial. ``When it came to farm credit and
federal crop insurance and ethanol _ Al Gore came through for us.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds: ``In fact, Al Gore is the only Democratic candidate for
president who has been there for us in our times of need.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign had flown a New Jersey farmer, Roy Etsch, who
has 1,100 acres of corn and hay near Princeton, to Iowa to tell the
crowd in Sloan that Bradley never showed any interest in New Jersey
farmers while representing the Senate from that state. Etsch told
the audience that he had never been able to meet Bradley despite
several attempts, and added dismissively that Bradley wouldn't know
the difference between corn and soybeans.
</P>
<P>
   Etsch, who said afterward that he was a Democrat who had voted
for Bradley in each Senate election, told the crowd that Bradley
``knows nothing about agriculture and cares less.''
</P>
<P>
   It made good theater, but many of the farmers did not seem
particularly impressed. While America's economic expansion is about
to set a record for its length, farmers are facing desperate times
because of the slump in commodity prices. In the last three years,
6,000 of Iowa's 20,000 hog farmers have gone out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Without giving exact particulars, Gore called for new farm
policies that would make payments to farmers whose prices are
cyclically depressed, for more export markets for agriculture, for
a larger exemption for family farms from the inheritance tax and
for stronger anti-trust action against large agribusiness concerns
that farmers often accuse of setting monopolistic prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't hear anything new or see that he had any answers,''
Don Hamisch, who farms alfalfa hay, said afterward. Hamisch, a
Democrat, said he was not sure who he would vote for in the
Democratic caucuses but that in the general election he would
probably vote Republican.
</P>
<P>
   During a question-answer period, some farmers asked tough
questions that were critical of the Clinton administration's
Justice Department, Agriculture Department and Trade
Representative. Whenever a skeptical question was raised, some of
the farmers would nod and whisper ``yes!''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the mood toward Gore was a bit more positive afterward
than before the meeting, and some farmers said a bit grudgingly
that he seemed to know something about their problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told us what we wanted to hear,'' said Bill Ortner, who
farms 3,000 acres of corn and soybeans and who earlier had
described himself as unhappy with all the candidates. ``He's tilted
me more to his side. And Senator Bradley is probably out of the
picture now.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore suggested in his talk that conservation programs might be
one way to increase revenue for family farmers, and many in the
audience seemed to welcome that. But many said that they were
suspicious of Gore because of his association with
environmentalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry about him being over-protective of the environment, so
that I can't do my job,'' fretted Frank Yanak, a local farmer.

 &HT;    Lockheed practiced bias against blacks, EEOC report says
 &HT;    By Steve Visser
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARIETTA, Ga. _ A federal investigation has determined that some
white managers at Lockheed Martin Aeronautical Systems
discriminated against black employes by overlooking them for
promotion, training, and overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found that
despite the Marietta-based company's assertion that promotions were
based on seniority and experience, black employees often had more
of both than white employees who won the promotions, according to
copies of the findings obtained by The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an extremely serious situation with far-reaching
consequences for employees at both Lockheed's Marietta plant and
other Lockheed plants,'' said Josie A. Alexander, one of the
lawyers representing more than 20 current and former Lockheed
employees. ``My clients believe there is an atmosphere of racism
that permeates the plant.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed President Tom Burbage denied a racist culture exists in
the plant, and he emphasized that the defense contractor has
long-standing policies forbidding discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the issues that were raised are widespread,'' he
said. ``I think it all relates to the past. I can do nothing about
the past but apologize for it for it. What I can deal with is the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is contesting the EEOC allegations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bernice Williams-Kimbrough, director of the Atlanta EEOC
district, issued nine findings of racial discrimination, and one
case of discrimination against the disabled. The EEOC also found
Lockheed managers retaliated against one employee for filing an
EEOC complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation is continuing in at least 10 other cases that
involve race, gender and disability, Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander has teamed up with Johnnie Cochran, the prominent
trial lawyer who became a household name during the O.J. Simpson
case, in pursing the case against Cobb County's largest private
employer. The case could achieve class action status since the EEOC
found discrimination existed against blacks as a group.
</P>
<P>
   The EEOC outlined its allegations in ``letters of
determination'' dated Sept. 30. The letters do not carry a legal
penalty. Instead, they are one step in a long process of bringing
discrimination claims under the federal statute.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed and the plaintiffs are tentatively scheduled to engage
in what amounts to settlement talks in February, Alexander said. If
an agreement can't be reached, the EEOC will either issue a
``right-to-sue'' letter to the plaintiffs, or elect to sue the
company itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process takes a lot of time and a lot of investigation,''
Burbage said. ``We work with the EEOC office to understand the
issues and resolve them.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the allegations, however, couldn't have been worse
for Lockheed. The Marietta plant is currently slashing its work
force, has had its leadership reshuffled, has just finished a tough
budget fight in Congress to keep funding for its F-22 stealth
fighter, and is struggling to find buyers for its mainstay, the
C-130J transport plane.
</P>
<P>
   Burbage, who became president in April, said he was frustrated
that there has been so much focus on the allegations of a handful
of the company's employees. He said the company has a good track
record in minority hiring and doing business with minority
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Burbage also said he has set up committees to facilitate better
communication between the blue-collar labor force and upper
management to cut out the filter of middle-management _ where the
EEOC documents indicated the discrimination problem existed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any work force that is 10,000 people big, it's not to say
the same frailties don't exist there as you find anywhere else in
society,'' Burbage said. ``If you get a picture of this company by
reading EEOC findings, that's one picture. If you try to get a real
understanding of what this company is all about, that's another
picture.''

reading EEOC findings, that's one picture. If you try to get a real
understanding of what this company is all about, that's another
picture.''

U.N. STUDIES HOW REFUGEES QUALIFY TO GET ASSISTANCE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Civil war in Angola has driven more than
370,000 people from the country, and everyone agrees that they are
refugees. An additional 1 million to 2 million people have fled
their houses, but have not crossed a border. This, in the eyes of
the United Nations, makes them ``internally displaced people,''
ineligible for international refugee aid.
</P>
<P>
   Why the difference?
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council confronted this question Thursday in a
debate that demonstrated how new wars demand new definitions and,
probably, new policies, if millions of people they have made
homeless are to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Refugee experts say 20 million or more people have abandoned
their houses, driven forcibly by governments and guerrilla armies
or voluntarily in search of safety, but they remain in their own
countries. That means that they fall outside the purview of the
organization's High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The high commissioner, Sadako Ogata, who has pushed hard in
recent years to include millions of the internally displaced within
her organization's reach, told the council that the war had
displaced 20 percent of Angola's population. Most, Mrs. Ogata said,
are ineligible for international aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difficulty of having access to large numbers of people in
insecure and isolated areas is compounded by the complexity of
assisting civilians in their own country, where their own state
authorities or rebel forces are frequently the very cause of their
predicament,'' Mrs. Ogata said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. representative, Richard Holbrooke, urged the council to
rethink how the refugee organization could be retooled to meet a
crisis that is worldwide, but most immediately catastrophic to
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a person who has been driven from his or her home by
conflict, there's no difference'' between a refugee and an
internally displaced person ``in terms of what's happened to
them,'' Holbrooke said. ``They're equally victims. But they're
treated differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, the council president this month, had summoned
experts to review refugee policies in Africa. But the debate soon
broadened to the anomaly of continuing to hold to definitions
written into the mandate of the U. N. High Commissioner for
Refugees office when it was created after World War II. At that
time, most displaced people were fleeing from country to country.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is moving to the center of debate among refugee
experts who have seen aid agencies become overwhelmed by the scale
and circumstances of recent internal displacements and refugee
movements, sometimes so tangled that sorting out people is nearly
impossible. This has been the case in Africa, the Balkans, East
Timor and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In some conflicts, governments are reluctant to open their
borders to international aid, as Russia is in Chechnya and India in
occupied Kashmir, because the conflicts are considered internal
security matters. There are also forced population resettlements in
the name of anti-terrorism or for large development projects.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study published jointly by the Brookings Institution
and the U.S. Committee for Refugees, both in Washington, called the
internal displacement of people ``one of the most pressing
humanitarian, human rights and political issues now facing the
global community.'' It urged the United States, both the Clinton
administration and Congress, to devise policies on the displaced as
effective and generous as existing American programs for refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Roberta Cohen, the co-director of a Brookings program on the
internally displaced and the co-author, with Francis Deng, a
special representative of Secretary-General Kofi Annan, of ``Masses
in Flight'' (Brookings 1998), said Thursday that establishing
another agency solely for this problem was unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political will is not there, nor the resources,'' Ms.
Cohen told reporters. Nevertheless, she said, the situation is ``an
absurdity'' that treats one group of people inside a border
differently from other members of the same group a few miles away
on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is now a realization that we've got to have an
international system that addresses the needs of people on both
sides of this border,'' she said. ``We are not set up to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke argued that the High Commissioner for Refugees was the
most logical agency to concentrate efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we must do,'' he said, ``is expand the definition of what
is a refugee, erode if not erase the distinction between a refugee
and a person who is internally displaced, deal with these problems,
fix the responsibility more clearly in a single agency and not fall
back on one of the worst of all euphemisms `we're coordinating
closely.'''

COMMENTARY: MR. PRESIDENT, YOU'VE GOT MAIL _ FROM SYRIA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TO: President Clinton &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FROM: Bashar.Assad(at)Hama.com
</P>
<P>
   Dear Mr. President: I saw your letter from Tuesday on my dad's
desk. Dad's not feeling too well these days. He fades in and out.
His elevator doesn't always go to the top floor anymore. So I'm
answering for him with this e-mail. As you know, I'm 34, and
President Assad's eldest surviving son and heir apparent. I was
trained as an ophthalmologist in London and am the founder of the
new Syrian Internet Society. Dad's not into the Web much. I still
tease him that he thinks the Internet is something you catch fish
with on the Euphrates.
</P>
<P>
   Bill _ may I call you Bill? _ I saw you asking my dad to make
some gesture of sweetness to the Israelis if we want to get our
occupied Golan Heights back. Well, Bill, let me ask you something:
Have you ever seen the movie ``Godfather II''? Because that's what
it's like around here. My dad didn't get to be Syria's Godfather by
treating his enemies ``sweet.'' You want my dad to offer the
Israelis a level of normalization that he doesn't have with Lebanon
or Jordan, let alone with his own brother, Rifaat.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, speaking of that lunatic Rifaat, there are days that my
dad would like to do to him what Al Pacino did to his brother Fredo
in ``Godfather II'' _ blow him away while he's sayin' his Hail
Marys. The press says Rifaat's been sitting around Paris and
Marbella, talking by phone with all his buddies in the Syrian Army,
plotting to get rid of me when Dad's gone. Dad just closed down the
illegal port Rifaat was running out of his summer home in Latakia.
The press said we blew it up with 40 tanks _ sort of ``urban
renewal'' with the residents still at home.
</P>
<P>
   You see, Bill, this is Hobbes' jungle here, not Hope, Ark. We
don't do sweetness. To think my dad is ever going to have fully
``normal'' relations with Israelis, who have occupied our land for
33 years, is a chimera. But you're all missing the point. Because
while the Israelis will never have warm relations with us, if we do
sign a peace treaty with them over the Golan it will lead to
normalization of their relations with the whole Arab world. We are
the keepers of the flame of the Arab-Israeli conflict, not that
quisling Yasser Arafat, and when we say it's over, it's over.
</P>
<P>
   My dad is serious, because he knows that the only way he can
turn power over to me is if he can get this Golan issue off the
table. Then I can focus on internal reform and modernization, which
is my strength. If the war with Israel is still on when my dad
goes, I don't stand a chance. Power will go right to the thugs
here.
</P>
<P>
   What you have to understand, Bill, is that my dad's Arab
generation, which was bent on fighting the Jews _ their role isn't
to smile on the Jews now. No one would believe it. Their role is to
declare that the war is over and to pave the way for my generation.
Only my dad can call an end to this war, and only I can normalize
relations with Israel. Only Mao could end the war between China and
the U.S., and only Deng could normalize relations. The Israelis can
have normalized peace with us _ on the installment plan.
</P>
<P>
   What else is in it for the Israelis? Are you kidding? A lot. An
end to the Arab ideological struggle. A shrinking of Iran's
influence, because the Iranians won't be able to work out of Syria
or Lebanon. An end to the bloody war in south Lebanon.
Early-warning stations on the Golan. And eventually an exchange of
embassies and trade. We're offering cold, hard substance and you
want us to bake them a cake! Look, we serve our peace cold around
here. And believe me, it's worth more to the Israelis that way,
because if we do it our way _ properly chilled _ every Arab will
know that we did it on our own terms because we felt it was in our
own interest to call this conflict quits. We will sell an end to
rejectionism to the Arabs, but Barak has to sell full withdrawal to
the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Bill, do you remember that scene in ``Godfather II'' when Hyman
Roth says to Al Pacino about the brutality of the mafia world: What
can we do? ``This is the business we've chosen.'' Well, this is the
neighborhood we and the Israelis have chosen. This ain't Sesame
Street here, pal, and my dad ain't Big Bird.
</P>
<P>
   You want a smile and a shoeshine? A kiss on both cheeks? Call
Arafat. That's his thing. You want to kiss goodbye to this
conflict, call my dad: Hafez al-Assad, the Capo di Tutti Capi
himself. He may be frail, but he's got one last scene in him _ and
I've got the whole next act. Trust me. Warmly, Bashar.

GEORGE PUTNAM TO STEP DOWN AS CHAIRMAN OF FAMED FUND GIANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ George Putnam said Thursday he will retire as head of
Putnam Investments, the mutual fund giant founded by his father
before World War II and rooted in an ancestor's 19th-century
landmark court ruling that spawned America's money management
business.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam will step down at the end of 2001 as chairman of Putnam
Management Co., popularly known as Putnam Investments. He will
retire as chairman and president of the firm's funds in June.
</P>
<P>
   At the fund group, John Hill, 57, an independent trustee who
runs an investment advisory firm, will become chairman. Putnam's
47-year-old son, George 3d, a Putnam trustee who runs two financial
services companies, will become president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a young person's business,'' Putnam Sr., 72, said
Thursday from his Florida vacation home. ``Investment management
requires a lot of youth and energy.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``there is a role for old poops like myself when the markets
turn,'' said the retiring executive, who will stay on as chairman
emeritus. ``A little gray hair comforts the shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   His retirement will have more symbolic than actual impact, since
Putnam Investments is effectively run by Lawrence Lasser, its
president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a business operations point of view, I don't think the
transition matters a lot,'' said Louis Harvey, president of Dalbar
Inc., a Boston fund consulting firm. ``Larry is driving the machine
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, another senior Putnam executive, Robert Lucey, a
managing director who oversees operations, reportedly told Lasser
he will retire. It was not immediately clear who would replace him.
</P>
<P>
   George Putnam Sr. epitomizes not just Harvard-educated, Brahmin
gentility, but the conservative investment ethos established by his
great-great-great-grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Putnam's historic ``prudent man rule,'' which he authored
in 1830 as a justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court,
established the legal foundation for professional money management.
The landmark decision said a trustee could carefully buy common
stocks on behalf of a client.
</P>
<P>
   The late George Putnam Jr., the senior Putnam's father, set up
an investment fund in 1925 and founded his namesake company, with
the flagship George Putnam Fund of Boston, in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam, the nation's fourth-largest fund firm, with 114 funds
and assets under management of $354 billion, is still guided by a
conservative investment philosophy that it calls ``truth in
labeling.'' It promises that portfolio managers will not leap into
areas not outlined in fund prospectuses.
</P>
<P>
   That means a large-cap growth fund won't suddenly load up on
bonds, or plunge into flavor-of-the-moment ``momentum'' plays
outside its mandate. The firm favors team management, not star
stockpickers.
</P>
<P>
   George Putnam Sr. was also an industry leader in hiring
independent trustees to oversee individual funds (and paying them
very well). He has served on the board of dozens of corporations
and institutions, including Houghton Mifflin, General Mills, and
the Museum of Fine Arts.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam said he would have retired last year after three decades
as fund family chairman, but that Hill had asked him to stay on
another year to give Hill ``time to get up to speed.''
</P>
<P>
   George Putnam 3d is head of New Generation Research and New
Generation Adviser, both in Boston. Hill oversees First Reserve
Corp., in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam, which was sold to Marsh &AMP; McLennan Cos. in 1970, has
seen sales soar in recent years as the market has boomed. But the
firm _ like many of its competitors _ has also experienced steep
withdrawals as investors have become more impatient.

ANALYSIS: EUROPEAN LAW HELPS CONTINENT BUILD SUPRANATIONAL
IDENTITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Deriding the bureaucracy, the bungling and the banana
wars of the European Union has long been a pastime on this
fractious Continent. But now a serious sense of European
citizenship, and the rights that go with it, seem to be laying the
basis of a supranational identity here.
</P>
<P>
   It is still early, and nobody is suggesting that France has
suddenly been expunged from the heart of the Frenchman. But the
advent of a common currency in the euro, the realization with the
conflict in the Balkans that a Europe of trade is not enough, and
the widening appreciation of a body of European law that takes
precedence over national law seem to be spurring a new
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a qualitative jump in the sense of European
identity,'' said Karl Kaiser, a German expert on international
affairs. ``What you are seeing are the first signs of shared
beliefs, rights and responsibilities among young Europeans no
longer ready to sit passively as America protects them or as the
Union grows.''
</P>
<P>
   One area where the nation-state seems to be rapidly losing
ground to the idea of a united Europe is that of the law. This was
evident in recent days as European court verdicts obliged Germany
and Britain to reconsider or revise basic military policy. And the
mere existence of a European Court of Human Rights led Turkey, an
aspiring member of the European Union, where the death penalty is
banned, to postpone the execution of Abdullah Ocalan, the Kurdish
rebel leader.
</P>
<P>
   For some time, treaties have enshrined the pre-eminence of
European law over national law in many areas, including the
environment, trade, human rights and working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But it has taken a long time for this reality to reach ordinary
citizens in Madrid or Munich. Europe was more often seen as the
source of regulations that encumbered lives than of laws that could
be liberating.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, the power of pan-European courts is being brought
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an absolute discovery, and a very good discovery, the
existence of this European court,'' said Tanja Kreil, the
23-year-old German woman whose campaign to be allowed to bear arms
in the German army was upheld by the European Court of Justice this
week. ``I used to think of myself as German. Now I feel a little
European, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kreil brought her case to a Hanover court in 1996. An
electrical engineer, she had been rejected by the army because of
Germany's constitutional ban on women's bearing arms, though women
had been allowed to serve in medical and musical units. The Hanover
court ultimately referred the case to the European Court of
Justice.
</P>
<P>
   This court, based in Luxembourg, and the European Court of Human
Rights in Strasbourg are quite distinct. The former deals with the
15 member states of the European Union, the latter with the 41
states that signed European Convention on Human Rights. But they
share a fast-rising number of cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our workload has increased by 75 percent since 1997, and
high-profile cases such that of Ocalan will accelerate this
trend,'' said Roderick Liddell, a spokesman for the European Court
of Human Rights, whose jurisdiction covers a population of 800
million people. ``The increase reflects a growing consciousness of
human rights and growing awareness that redress may be sought
beyond the nation-state at European level.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a ruling in September by the Court of Human Rights that
led Britain this week to end its ban on openly gay men and women as
members of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   At the European Court of Justice, whose jurisdiction is the 376
million citizens of the European Union, judges and lawyers are
similarly swamped, with the number of cases growing by more than 10
percent a year and over 1,000 cases pending. Unwieldy translation
requirements slow proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The court enforces the Union's treaties _ trying to ensure the
absence of discrimination in institutions like the German army,
ruling on the freedom of European citizens to seek jobs wherever
they wish among the member states, enforcing environmental laws
like emission requirements or regulations on the disposal of
nuclear waste.
</P>
<P>
   Long perceived as distant or impenetrable, this court is now
coming closer to ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to be associated with abstruse things like fishing
quotas,'' said Fionnuala Connolly, an official at the court. ``But
increasingly European citizens see that this is a place where they
can uphold their rights.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, this development is a natural extension of the
European idea. The lure of the European Union, for many nations,
has always lain in the assurance membership offered of the rule of
law. Successive countries emerging from dictatorship _ including
Greece, Spain and Portugal _ founded their modern identity in part
on the stability the Union provided.
</P>
<P>
   A similar lure is still at work _ prodding countries like
Hungary and Romania to settle old territorial disputes in
preparation for membership, or Turkey to improve its human-rights
record in a bid to enter the club.
</P>
<P>
   But while the framework of the rule of law has clearly had
critical political repercussions, and has made the European Union a
beacon throughout the Continent, the growth of a supranational
European identity based on European laws within the Union has been
much slower.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is in the area of law that European states have made some
of the most critical concessions of sovereignty and people are only
now becoming aware of this,'' said Ezra Suleiman, a Princeton
University expert on the European Union. ``The political
implications are incredible, because Europe seems bound to shift
slowly from the project of an elite to more of a grass-roots
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Of course, national governments are not always pleased by this
growing influence of European law. France, for domestic political
reasons, has recently defied a European court order that it lift
its ban on the sale of British beef.
</P>
<P>
   The legal developments reflecting a new European identity are
not happening in isolation. The war in Kosovo provoked a widespread
European outrage that in turn spurred a new European patriotism. It
is only nascent, but for the first time since World War II, there
is a sense of European responsibility for the security of the
Continent.
</P>
<P>
   European leaders have already resolved to change European
treaties in order to merge Europe's ineffective security arm, the
West European Union, with the European Union itself. Plans to
develop a European military force that is ``separable but not
separate'' from NATO, in the words of German Defense Minister
Rudolf Scharping, are being pushed forward vigorously.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the introduction of the euro _ despite its
relative weakness _ has certainly encouraged people to see
themselves more as Europeans, a trend likely to accelerate when the
currency begins to circulate two years from now.
</P>
<P>
   All these developments will test relations with U.S. governments
accustomed to a Europe that, in Henry Kissinger's phrase, had no
telephone number. Exasperation in Washington with European weakness
could give way to irritation at a new European assertiveness if
European identity really takes root.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States got used to an alliance with an enormous
disparity of power,'' Kaiser said. ``There was America and a large
number of smaller, sometimes divided allies. Now those allies are
combining, and on many issues they have the same opinion. For
Washington to adapt to this is already visibly difficult.''

BRUNT OF AIDS EPIDEMIC MOVES TO MINORITY MEN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The nation's AIDS epidemic has passed a new milestone: minority
men who have sex with other men have surpassed white gay men as the
group of Americans most likely to have acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   The statistic _ 52 percent of all homosexually acquired AIDS now
involves men of color _ is evidence of a fundamental shift in a
disease long identified in this country as predominantly affecting
white gay men.
</P>
<P>
   ``These data will surprise many across the nation,'' said Dr.
Helene Gayle of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
which is publishing the numbers Friday. ``We still think of the gay
epidemic as being largely a white one and may not realize how much
it is spreading to the gay and bisexual minority communities.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Gayle added, those who follow AIDS closely
have seen this benchmark a long way off. ``The startling thing
about this. . .is that this trend has been going on all along and
people have kind of ignored this,'' she said. ``The surprise is
that people are surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Phill Wilson, director of the African American AIDS Policy and
Training Institute at the University of Southern California in Los
Angeles, said: ``The tragedy here is that this did not have to
happen. We gay and bi men of color were disproportionately affected
in 1989. . .and yet we did not do enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows what happens when we do not understand the
complexities of race, gender, and sexual orientation in
minorities,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   The shift of HIV and AIDS as a predominantly minority epidemic
has more than historical importance, said AIDS experts and
activists. It is much tougher for public health programs to reach
many minority men who engage in homosexual behavior, they said,
because many are more reluctant than white gay men to acknowledge
and modify their risky behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many gay and bisexual Latino and African-American
men who have sexual contact with men, but who identify as
heterosexual,'' said Laurence ``Carrie'' Farrell, an AIDS
specialist at Dimock Community Health Center in Boston. ``There's a
good deal of same-sex behavior there, but it's not talked about at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   African-American men who acquired the human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) from other men are four times more likely than white
men in that situation to call themselves heterosexual rather than
gay or bisexual, according to a recent, unpublished CDC study of
nearly 8,800 HIV-infected men. Latino men were more than twice as
likely as non-Hispanic whites to consider themselves heterosexual,
despite their homosexual contacts.
</P>
<P>
   The marked ``fear and self-loathing'' that surrounds
homosexuality among black and Latino men ``hampers education
efforts that target gay-identified men, and leads to unknowing
infections of wives and girlfriends and children,'' said Dr. Rafael
Campo of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The new data also suggest minority males are being infected
through same-sex exposures at younger ages than white men. A
sampling of HIV-infected Americans found that 16 percent of African
Americans were teenagers or in their early 20s, 13 percent of
Latino males were aged 13 to 24, and nine percent of infected white
males were this young.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really the most alarming news is how much younger men of color
are becoming infected,'' said Julio Abreu of AIDS Action, a
Washington-based advocacy group. ``Clearly it's not enough to say
we're going to have messages targeted at gay youth. We have to talk
about gay youth of color.''
</P>
<P>
   Gayle said the data underscore that the federal government needs
``to expand our efforts directed toward men of color.''
</P>
<P>
   The CDC can identify $137 million last year that was targeted to
African American communities for AIDS prevention efforts, but much
of that was not specifically targeted to black men who engage in
same-sex behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we were able to provide $7 million new dollars to
community-based programs for men of color,'' Gayle said. ``But
clearly, $7 million is only a drop in the bucket and more needs to
be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo, the Boston physician, said the Latino community
especially needs to focus more attention on the HIV epidemic. He
noted that a 1998 attempt to convene Hispanic leaders to a ``summit
meeting'' sponsored by the Harvard AIDS Institute was largely
rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite sadly, none of the prominent Latinos came, with one
exception, entertainer Rosie Perez,'' Campo said. ``Elected
officials were invited, prominent entertainers, sports figures,
business leaders. It was quite astonishing to see the silence as we
tried to begin a dialogue on this. . .in the face of these
incredibly shocking statistics. Some congressmen we invited
represent districts that have among the highest AIDS rates in the
nation. None of them came.''
</P>
<P>
   Farrell, the Boston AIDS educator, said the new statistics
should help arouse interest in minority communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're close to a tipping point,'' he said. ``I don't
know anyone. . .who doesn't know someone who is infected or
affected by HIV. That means we have reached that critical mass. The
next challenge is: OK, what are we going to do about it?''

   ARGUN, Russia _ The Russian military insists it has again taken
control of Argun from Chechen rebels. But soldiers moving through
the town on Thursday clearly did not think all the danger had
passed, as they scanned the rooftops and windows of the battered
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are snipers around'' a Russian officer shouted. ``Take
care.''
</P>
<P>
   Argun has become a conspicuous example of how hard it may be for
Russia to keep what it has taken.
</P>
<P>
   Across Chechnya, Russian troops tried on Thursday to tighten
their grip over the breakaway republic, in the throes of its second
war in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   At the Ingush-Chechnya border, troops all but closed the
frontier and demanded that all males aged 10 to 60 be checked. The
move effectively reversed the Russian policy of encouraging
refugees to return to Chechnya, since families refused to travel
without their men.
</P>
<P>
   And here in Argun, only six miles east of Grozny, the capital,
Interior Ministry troops and militia went house to house, looking
in basements, attics and even wells, as they combed for rebel
diehards and sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to conduct repeated and more thorough checks
across entire Chechnya,'' Interior Minister Vladimir B. Rushailo
said on a trip to Chechnya. ``The militants did not simply
disappear. They are here among us.''
</P>
<P>
   Some officers said they doubted Argun, first taken by the
Russians in early December, would ever be totally secure.
</P>
<P>
   The latest battle began Sunday. In the fighting, the Russian
military commandant was encircled by militants and gunned down
after two armored personnel carriers that escorted him out of his
headquarters were destroyed, Russian officers said on Thursday.
Russian artillery pounded the city.
</P>
<P>
   The official Russian toll was four dead and five wounded, but
some soldiers said the true figure was higher. ``The say it was
three or four, but in fact 30 died,'' yelled a Russian soldier
standing next to an armored personnel carrier as a small group of
journalists walked past. ``Write that!''
</P>
<P>
   Argun was a dismal place before the fight. It had gas, though
only since December, but no electricity. Pensions, salaries and
subsidies had not been paid, and many of the refugees who came from
even more dangerous areas say they are cold and hungry. The schools
have yet to open and the trains do not run. But the local market
has started to do business again.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels began their counteroffensive early Sunday morning
soon after truckloads of militants zoomed into the city. It is not
clear how the hundreds of militants managed to get through.
</P>
<P>
   Russian army troops are supposed to operate checkpoints along
the roads. They stop young men, checking their trigger fingers for
calluses and ordering them to remove their shirts so they can check
their shoulders for marks of rifle slings and bruises from the
kickback of automatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But Chechens say they often bribe their way through, and the
vigilance of the Russians appears to fade at night.
</P>
<P>
   By 9 a.m. the militants had clambered on the rooftops and
entered the city center. Yelling, they began their assault on the
railroad station, the militia headquarters and the adjoining base
for elite OMON militia units.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard for me to talk about this,'' said an OMON
militiamen who comes from Magnitogorsk, a Ural mountains steel
town, before he turned away with his head down. ``It came out of
the blue. They began shooting from grenade launchers. Only
yesterday the `two hundreds' were taken away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Two hundreds'' is army slang for corpses. One explanation is
that a corpse packed in a zinc coffin and wooden crate for
transport weights 200 kilos.
</P>
<P>
   Others said the main fighting lasted 12 hours basically without
a break.
</P>
<P>
   As the rebels pressed their attack, a rebel negotiating team
carrying a white flag approached Russian troops at the railway
station, the scene of the fiercest fighting. The rebels demanded
that the Russians surrender and promised that they could leave. The
Russians refused.
</P>
<P>
   A burnt-out armored personnel carrier and truck provides some
gruesome evidence of what happened to the Russian military
commandant of the town, Col. Vladimir Kushnaryov, who came from St.
Petersburg late last month.
</P>
<P>
   The colonel was gunned down after his armored column was
surrounded. Some Russian officials said that local people asked the
colonel to come to negotiations and that militants shot him from
behind a crowd of civilians as he ventured out of his headquarters.
Others say he was simply trying to see what was happening in the
town.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commandant was riddled with bullets,'' said Oleg, a member
of an OMON unit from Nyzhny Tagil in the Urals. ``Two platoon
commanders were killed and had their ears cut off.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Nikolai Koshman, the Russian vice prime minister
who administers the Russian controlled areas, vowed to track down
the culprits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to find those who killed the commandant,'' Koshman
said. ``And we have to find all the accomplices.''
</P>
<P>
   To counter the rebels, the Russians began firing artillery.
Russian troops and residents say that some civilian homes were
destroyed by the shells. Some civilians were being tended to at the
hospital here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the rebels left Sunday night, but the Russians kept on
shelling,'' said Said Magomad Allaudinov, 42. ``The following day
and the next night, they kept shelling the city. It was heavy fire.
Maybe it was mortars. Maybe tanks.''
</P>
<P>
   Snipers, however, were active in the city for three more days.
Elsewhere in the Chechen lowlands, Russian troops took careful
precautions. Transport helicopters skimmed a few dozen feet over
the ground, following the undulating terrain, and zig-zaged as they
approached Argun.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops say they need to do more to prevent rebel
attacks. OMON soldiers say the Russian troops should seal the
routes to the settlements more tightly, including the dirt roads
and pathways that the Chechens know better than the soldiers
</P>
<P>
   But others voiced doubt they could secure much more than a
temporary respite. One officer from an OMON unit from Khabarovsk in
Russia's Far East said he expected the turmoil to continue, as
Russian troops and the rebels tussle over Chechnya and its
resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as there is money to be made from the oil in Chechnya,
this will keep happening,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For the first time since AIDS was discovered nearly 20 years
ago, more black and Hispanic gay men were diagnosed with AIDS than
white gay men over a year's period, federal health officials
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 18,153 AIDS cases were diagnosed among gay men in
1998, the most recent year available, and blacks and Hispanics
represented 9,182, or 51 percent, of the cases, the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention said in its weekly report. This
compares with 8,678 cases, or 48 percent, for white gay men. Black
gay men made up one-third of all AIDS cases among gays, Hispanics
18 percent and Asian and Pacific Islanders 1 percent of the cases
in that year, the centers said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the AIDS epidemic began, most AIDS cases have been among
gay men, and white gay men have made up the largest subgroup. But
through the years the percentages have steadily risen for black and
Hispanic gay men as those for white gay men decreased.
</P>
<P>
   For example, for the years from 1989 to 1998, the percentage of
AIDS cases diagnosed among black and Hispanic gay men rose to 51
from 30, and for white gay men it dropped to 48 from 69.
</P>
<P>
   CDC officials said that the new figures were the strongest
evidence yet of the magnitude of the epidemic among black and
Hispanic gay men, and they said the shift was the result of a
number of factors. One was that white gay men organized to educate
themselves about the use of condoms and other prevention measures,
while minority groups largely ignored the issue of infection with
HIV, the AIDS virus, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Stigma about homosexuality seems to be playing a major role in
the spread of infection with HIV, and the stigma may be even
greater among blacks and Hispanics than it is among whites, said
Dr. Helene Gayle, who heads HIV program at the centers.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a CDC survey of 8,780 HIV-infected men who had sex with
men found that many infected black and Hispanic gay men who said
they became HIV-infected from sex with other men did not identify
themselves as homosexual or bisexual. Of those surveyed, 24 percent
of black and 15 percent of Hispanic men who said they had sex with
men identified themselves as being heterosexual compared with 6
percent among a similar group of white men.
</P>
<P>
   By not considering themselves at high risk for AIDS, black and
Latino gay men may not seek or receive the HIV prevention and
treatment services they need and may unintentionally put their male
and female sex partners at risk, Dr. Gayle said in a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   CDC, the federal agency in Atlanta charged with tracking and
preventing the spread of AIDS in the United States, also found that
gay and bisexual black and Hispanic men became infected at an
earlier age than white gay men.
</P>
<P>
   The findings underscore the need for intensifying prevention
efforts among blacks and Hispanics, particularly those who may be
poor and lack access to health care, CDC officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The news ``will surprise many people across the nation who think
the gay AIDS epidemic is a totally white one,'' Dr. Gayle said.
But, she added, ``the surprise is that people are surprised''
because people have ignored this trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did not need to happen,'' said Phil Wilson of the African
American AIDS Policy and Training Institute at the University of
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said that more black churches, fraternities, sororities,
civic organizations and civil rights groups needed to speak out on
AIDS. Wilson said he was shocked that there was so little about
this issue in black media.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rafael Campo of Beth Israel Deaconness Medical Center in
Boston, added, ``Today's shocking data are merely a harbinger of
worse news to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo said that when the Harvard AIDS Institute invited
prominent Hispanic sports, entertainment and health leaders and
elected officials to a summit on AIDS in the Hispanic community
similar to one held by the black community, ``quite sadly'' only
one person came. ``It was quite astonishing to see the silence in
action when we were trying to develop initiatives in the face of
these incredibly shocking statistics,'' Campo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the congressmen we invited represent districts that
have among the highest AIDS rates in nation and none of them
came,'' Campo said without naming them.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings come from continuing analyses of AIDS cases
reported to the CDC from all states and territories for the decade
from 1989 through 1998, the latest full year for which data are
available.
</P>
<P>
   Since powerful new drug treatments became available in 1996, the
number of AIDS cases and deaths have declined among all gay men.
However, declines have not been as steep among black and Hispanic
gay and bisexual men compared with white gay and bisexual men,
suggesting possible differences in access to care.

SCHWAB TO ACQUIRE U.S. TRUST IN FIRST BIG DEAL UNDER NEW BANK
LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the first big financial services deal since
Congress changed decades-old banking laws last fall, Charles Schwab
Corp. said Thursday that it would make a leap across both the
country and the investment spectrum to buy U.S. Trust Corp. for
$2.73 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Acquiring U.S. Trust, a New York-based private bank that caters
to the wealthiest Americans, would be a big step in the
transformation of San Francisco-based Schwab from a discount
brokerage firm for do-it-yourself investors to a full-service firm
that also offers personalized investment advice to customers
willing to pay for it. Schwab has been adding products and services
to its offerings in an attempt to distance itself from the dozens
of low-commission electronic brokerages that have sprung up in the
last several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers have been telling us they need more help with
their complex financial lives,'' said Charles R. Schwab, who
founded his company as one of the first discount brokerage firms
and built it into the nation's biggest electronic brokerage firms.
Now, he said, the richest of them will have access to services
provided by U.S. Trust, including estate planning, tax planning and
investment management.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab is paying a rich price, offering 3.427 of its highly
valued shares for each share of U.S. Trust. At Schwab's Wednesday
closing price of $37.625, that translates to about $129 a share, or
about 63 percent more than U.S. Trust's Wednesday closing price of
$78.875. That price includes about $150 million in cash and stock
options being offered to every employee of U.S. Trust to keep them
from leaving the company for two years after the transaction, which
is expected to close by July.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Schwab fell about $3 a share Thursday morning but
recovered after analysts were briefed on the deal and closed up
$2.875, to at $40.50. U.S. Trust's shares soared $54.125, to $133.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Trust, with $80 billion is assets, is small compared with
Schwab. Schwab took in about $107 billion in new assets last year,
and now has more than $700 billion.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While some analysts were recommending that U.S. Trust
shareholders sell their shares now and pocket the profits, others
were recommending hanging on to Schwab stock. Ronald Baron, a money
manager whose company holds about 25 million shares of stock said
he thinks Schwab can become ``one of the most profitable, biggest
businesses in the United States.'' He said, ``I think I'm going to
make 10 times my money in the next seven to nine years. We've
already made 40 times our money in the last eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Executives of both companies acknowledged Thursday that the
match was not an obvious one because the firms appear to have very
different customers and corporate cultures. ``When we first
approached them, I think their reaction was, Why would we combine
with a discount brokerage company?'' said David Pottruck, who
shares the chairman and chief executive titles with Schwab.
</P>
<P>
   Pottruck said he made that initial contact with H. Marshall
Schwarz, the chairman and chief executive of U.S. Trust, early last
year about a year after he became a private-banking customer at
U.S. Trust. Pottruck, who sold about $100 million of Schwab stock
last year, said that he switched his private-banking account to
U.S. Trust because he was unhappy with the service he was getting
at Wells Fargo before that.
</P>
<P>
   After several meetings between executives of the two companies ,
discussions ended last summer without an agreement. Had a deal been
hatched then, before Congress repealed the Glass-Steagall Act of
1933 that prevented securities firms from buying banks, Schwab
would have needed to restructure itself as a bank holding company,
Pottruck said. To do that, Schwab probably would have had to set
off its business of making markets in stocks as a separate
subsidiary, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The changes in banking laws cleared the way for Schwab to become
a financial holding company with U.S. Trust as a standalone unit.
``When I saw the change in legislation, I thought this could make a
difference for U.S. Trust'' because it would increase the ranks of
potential buyers of the company, Pottruck said. `We were scared to
death of U.S. Trust going into play.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Pottruck said, he was surprised when Jeffrey Maurer,
president and chief operating officer of U.S. Trust, called him in
November to revive discussions of a deal. Schwarz said he and his
management team had concluded that the firms were not as different
as they seemed and that they complemented each other in some
important ways.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Schwab has been an innovator in the use of
technology in financial services, leading the charge onto the
Internet that spawned a raft of competitors, such as E-Trade Group
and Ameritrade Holdings. U.S. Trust has not kept up with
technological advances; in fact, most of its processing is handled
by another bank, Chase Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab plans to change its Web site, one of the most visited
locations on the World Wide Web, to provide U.S. Trust customers
access to up-to-date information on their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will bring them some new types of innovation,'' Pottruck
said of U.S. Trust management. ``They tend to be a little more
cautious and incremental in their thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwab also plans to share the research on about 250 stocks
published by U.S. Trust's 25 analysts with Schwab customers who now
receive research from several sources, including investment banks
Credit Suisse First Boston and Hambrecht &AMP; Quist. After swearing
for years that they would never tell their customers how to invest,
Schwab executives have been searching for a way to offer stock
research that does not contradict their oft-stated view that most
Wall Street research is tainted by the firms' conflicts as
investment bankers to many of the companies they analyze.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz said U.S. Trust plans to add several analysts and double
the number of companies it covers. But Pottruck said that Schwab
will not be ``pushing a hot stock that is going to double in the
next nanosecond.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The executives said they expect the deal, which is structured as
a pooling of interests rather than a purchase for accounting
purposes, to add a 1 cent a share to Schwab's earnings this year
and 2 to 3 cents a share next year, without any significant cost
savings.
</P>
<P>
   That was not an attractive enough promise for one analyst who
has followed U.S. Trust for several years, Raphael Soifer of Brown
Brothers Harriman.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have anything against Schwab but it is a very
volatile, market-sensitive stock and our market forecast is for a
bear market within the next six months,'' Soifer said. A downturn
in the stock market would spell trouble for Schwab, which derives
about 60 percent of its revenue from its customers' trades.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab also faces increasing competition from traditional
brokerage firms, such as Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter &AMP; Co., which have started offering online stock trading
in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Reducing its dependence on market activity is one reason for
Schwab to want to buy U.S. Trust. The company gets almost all of
its revenue from fees paid its wealthy clients for management of
their assets. It aims to attract customers with at least $1 million
in investable assets and is known for a regular survey of the
wealthiest 1 percent of Americans that it conducts.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Trust keeps about 1 percent of the assets clients place
with the firm, compared with just 0.67 percent for Schwab. Pottruck
said his firm's cut of clients' assets had been declined from 0.85
percent just three years ago, but Schwab had more than made up for
that shrinkage by attracting about $500 billion of new assets.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon de Oliveira, chairman of J.P. Morgan Asset Management,
which contains the private banking unit of J.P. Morgan, said he was
happy to see Schwab paying such a high price for a competitor.
``It's amazing what a high stock price can do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   De Oliveira said many affluent customers have their money spread
among several financial firms. ``There's a race among a number of
private banks for those customers,'' he said. ``That's the real
sweet spot of the market.''

 &HT;    McCain shines before a crowd
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ If campaigns take the form that best suits the
candidate, then Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) showed this week why his
campaign prefers the free-wheeling town meeting to formal speeches.
</P>
<P>
   On his 26th trip to New Hampshire, McCain gave two formal
speeches and held six town meetings, during which he typically
spoke for about 15 minutes and then took 45 minutes of questions or
more.
</P>
<P>
   His speech Thursday to the New Hampshire Legislature had a
perfunctory air to it. McCain read his text word for word, and not
particularly well.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would create the position of ``reform czar'' if he is
elected, a Cabinet-level position to oversee the reforms that are
the core of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   There was little reaction, even though 75 of the more than 400
New Hampshire lawmakers support his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   A McCain town meeting, by contrast, is participatory theater.
</P>
<P>
   They are usually lively affairs, and this week, the audiences
were huge.
</P>
<P>
   If the McCain team feared that his support would wane following
last week's news reports that he had intervened with federal
agencies on behalf of campaign donors, they must have been
comforted by this week's crowd counts.
</P>
<P>
   A midday rally in Dublin, N.H., drew 750 people who saw McCain
hold forth beneath a conveniently placed banner that read, ``Truth
and Courage.''
</P>
<P>
   An evening event in Keene must have made fire marshals nervous
over the way campaign aides stuffed 500 people into a hotel meeting
room.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few people asked McCain about his actions on behalf of
contributors, and there was no evident dissatisfaction in the crowd
with his explanation that he considers it his job as Senate
Commerce Committee chairman to prod sluggish bureaucracies to
action.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Muccino of Amherst, a retired pilot, said after the meeting,
``He did what our elected officials are supposed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The most sustained applause came when he pledged to run a
positive campaign. ``There's going to be no negative comments, no
negative ads from this campaign,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even as McCain lays out policy proposals, his campaign keeps
coming back to assessments of character.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what these town meetings are all about. Sometimes I'm
going to tell you what you don't want to hear. But I'm always going
to tell you what I believe,'' he said to applause.
</P>
<P>
   In Dublin, Dorcey Flynn, a health care worker who is still torn
between McCain and Democrat Bill Bradley, voiced a frequently heard
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like his air of authority and his decisiveness,'' Flynn
said. ``Yet he also seems ready to listen to information.''
</P>
<P>
   PACKED BUMPER TO BUMPER
</P>
<P>
   McCain, reporters and campaign aides are cheek by jowl these
days on the Straight Talk Express, the campaign bus.
</P>
<P>
   It remains open to reporters from the day's start straight
through to the finish. But so many more media outlets want a piece
of the action that campaign aides are forced to ration the prized
seats in the back with the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   So many people crowded onto the bus Thursday that the driver
warned an aide that he might have trouble if he had to stop
suddenly on the snowy day.
</P>
<P>
   In the back, though, nothing had changed. McCain held forth on
any and all topics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside of my prison experience, I have never been more tired
than I am from time to time in this campaign,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Camera crews from England, Japan and MTV dropped in and out.
``Are you living la vida loca?'' MTV's Kate Sotak asked above the
whine of the bus's motor.
</P>
<P>
   McCain did his quite respectable impersonation of Bob Dole and
rattled off the species, if not the names, of most of his family's
32 pets, including several despised chickens and small dogs.
</P>
<P>
   MAKING JOKES ALONG THE WAY
</P>
<P>
   McCain says he has never done stand-up comedy. Cindy McCain, his
wife, says he watched a lot of Johnny Carson. But McCain reels off
a well-worn cache of jokes whenever he can, which was several times
a day this week in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   On Arizona's lack of water: ``The trees chase the dog.''
</P>
<P>
   On the lead character for the movie version of his memoir, Faith
of My Fathers: ``I want Tom Cruise. My kids want Danny DeVito.''
</P>
<P>
   On why he's running for president: ``My wife says it's because I
suffered several sharp blows to the head in prison.''
</P>
<P>
   On the depths to which his campaign has sunk: ``I spoke at a
West Point graduates' dinner.'' (McCain is a Naval Academy
alumnus.)
</P>
<P>
   On his low standing in early New Hampshire polls last year: ``I
was at 3 percent in a poll that had a margin of error of 5 percent.
So conceivably I started this campaign at minus 2 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   On his attendance at the MTV awards last year with daughter
Meghan: ``The greatest assault on my senses since I was in
prison.''
</P>
<P>
   There are more. And McCain may have a chance to tell them when
he appears Jan. 20 on CBS-TV's ``Late Night with David Letterman.''

STATE SEEKS EXPERT HELP IN POSSIBLE SALE OF HARVARD HMO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN AND RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Officials signaled Thursday they may consider a sale of
Harvard Pilgrim Health Care to an outside buyer, announcing they
plan to hire an investment banker to solicit proposals to
recapitalize the ailing health maintenance organization.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly said a firm would be selected
Friday and begin work immediately to provide a ``menu of options''
in 10 days for bringing Harvard Pilgrim back to health.
</P>
<P>
   Further suggesting regulators want to be prepared for a speedy
sale, Reilly said he is invoking a state rule that allows him to
take an extra measure of control over Harvard Pilgrim in the event
of a sale. The move means Reilly would oversee the possible
conversion of Harvard Pilgrim from a nonprofit to a for-profit
company.
</P>
<P>
   While he stressed regulators simply want to explore all options
_ including selling pieces of the health plan to multiple buyers,
or obtaining loans or some otheof finanancing _ the
announcement immediately sparked speculation of a for-profit buyer
and set off a firestorm of controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Trade groups, including a coalition of health-care professionals
known as the Ad Hoc Committee to Defend Health Care, unleashed a
flurry of protests. ``This would be a drastic mistake,'' Paul Ling,
a Quincy clinical psychologist who is a member of the committee,
said of a possible for-profit buyer. ``At best, it's a very
short-term solution that will present us with even greater crises
in the not-too-distant future.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State William F. Galvin said Reilly's announcement
is a ``stunning development that would change the entire landscape
of health care in Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to calm the storm, Reilly called reporters late in the
day, saying, ``I do not want to leave the impression that we are
seeking a for-profit buyer. In no way shape or form do I want to
say that we are predisposed to anything. We want to pursue every
conceivable option to recapitalize Harvard Pilgrim. That would
include for-profit and nonprofit solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, industry observers have said that other nonprofit health
plans in the state are in no financial condition to buy Harvard
Pilgrim, by far the largest plan in the state. And for all
practical purposes, buyers would be limited to large national
for-profit health insurers such as Cigna Group, based in
Philadelphia; Wellpoint Health Networks, a California HMO; United
Health Care, a Minnesota HMO; or Aetna, a health insurer based in
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Conceivably, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts might
be interested in stepping in, but most health executives say the
company does not have the financial wherewithal to pull off such a
feat.
</P>
<P>
   State regulators took control of Harvard Pilgrim Jan. 4 after
health plan officials said they discovered $58.5 million in 1999
losses that they didn't know about before. The discovery meant
Harvard Pilgrim's projected losses for the year soared to at least
$150 million, and possibly as high as $177 million.
</P>
<P>
   A judge's order mandated that state regulators come up with a
plan for bailing out the health plan within 30 days, a feat that
now looks nearly impossible, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly said Thursday that officials finally have received what
they believe is their first reliable information about Harvard
Pilgrim's daily cash flow _ an indicator of the health plan's
ability to pay its day-to-day bills.
</P>
<P>
   The report indicated that ``for now'' Harvard Pilgrim can meet
its daily obligations as well as pay some of the debts it already
owes to health providers, Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also said they have received their first indication of
the size of Harvard Pilgrim's debts, a report on the HMO's top 10
creditors and how much they are owed. That report will be shipped
to hospitals Friday to see whether the information provided by
Harvard Pilgrim squares with what hospitals say the health plan
owes. Officials declined to disclose details of the report.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, officials said 100 Harvard Pilgrim employees were
laid off Thursday. The layoffs were part of Harvard Pilgrim's
turnaround plan even before the health plan was placed in
receivership, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Hampering state officials' plans to move quickly on a Harvard
Pilgrim bailout is the disarray of its accounting systems, which is
so confusing that officials said they can't rely on it.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Reilly said he believes enough reliable information
has been cobbled together by accountants hired by the state
Insurance Division to satisfy possible buyers or lenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got enough here to solicit serious proposals,'' he said
in an interview Thursday. ``We would expect people who are serious
would want to perform their own due diligence anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, officials concede the state's timetable to receive offers
for the health plan, which has annual revenue of $2.8 billion, is
ambitious. It calls for offers that must then be evaluated and
negotiated in roughly two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly said it's unlikely that any plan would be completed
within the 30-day deadline.

GROUP CRITICAL OF TEXAS, MICHIGAN IN RESTRICTING ACCESS TO
ABORTION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional trim) 
 
By STEVE LASH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An abortion-rights group Thursday assailed Texas
and Michigan for enacting the greatest number of state laws in 1999
that restrict access to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League,
which actively backs abortion rights Democrats for high office,
blamed Texas Gov. George W. Bush for what the group called the
state's failure to appreciate a woman's right to choose.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is the leading candidate for the Republican presidential
nomination, and Michigan Gov. John Engler is a close adviser to
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But Kate Michelman, president of the group popularly known as
NARAL, said presidential politics played no part in the league's
compilation of data for its ninth annual review of state abortion
laws. However, as the information came together, ``it leapt out at
us'' that the GOP front-runner and Engler lead states that enacted
seven laws each last year that restrict abortion access, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana passed the next highest number of laws last year with
five, the group reported.
</P>
<P>
   NARAL issued its report as the group has been airing 30-second
television ads in Iowa and New Hampshire telling voters that a Bush
presidency would threaten the right of women to choose abortion.
Iowa will hold a Republican presidential nominating caucus Jan. 24,
and New Hampshire will hold a nominating primary Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush uses the slogan `compassionate conservative' to describe
himself but it hardly describes the record he has compiled as
governor when it comes to ensuring women's reproductive health and
rights,'' Michelman said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Bush, she praised the two candidates for the
Democratic presidential nomination, saying that Vice President Al
Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey would ``both
protect a woman's right to choose.''
</P>
<P>
   A Bush campaign spokesman disagreed with Michelman's
characterization of the governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush believes all Americans want to reduce the number
of abortions, no matter where you stand on the issue,'' said Scott
McClellan.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has tried to reduce abortions in Texas by promoting
teen-age abstinence, streamlining the adoption process and signing
into law last year a measure that requires parents to be notified
before their minor daughters have abortions.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to NARAL, the Texas Right to Life Committee, which
opposes abortion, lauded Bush and the state Legislature for
enacting the laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legislation that was passed ensures the health and safety
of the women and young girls in our state,'' said Joe Kral, the
committee's legislative director. ``I think Texas has gone in the
right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Kral particularly praised the law requiring parental
notification, saying it helps mothers and fathers protect the
welfare of their daughters.
</P>
<P>
   NARAL, however, cited that statute as a sign of Bush's
opposition to a woman's right to choose. The group said the law
effectively bars many girls, who fear severe punishment if their
parents discover their pregnancies, from exercising their
constitutional right to choose abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, which took effect Jan. 1, girls 17 or younger
cannot get an abortion without one of their parents being notified
_ unless a judge decides otherwise. A judge can grant a ``bypass''
to the notification requirement if he decides that the girl is
mature enough to make her own decision or if notifying a parent
will be harmful.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, pressed on whether he would pick a running mate who
opposes abortion rights, has responded that he would impose no
``litmus test'' in making his selection. Asked if he would pick
people for the Supreme Court based on whether they believe women
should have a constitutional right to choose abortion, Bush has
responded only that he would pick jurists who strictly interpret
the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Michelman, however, said Bush's call for such ``strict
constructionists'' on the Supreme Court was a ``code word'' for
justices who reject the idea that the Constitution protects choice
and would vote to overturn Roe vs. Wade, the court's landmark 1973
decision legalizing abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear from our findings that the freedom to choose
stands at a critical crossroads,'' she added. ``Down one road lies
an anti-choice president, an anti-choice Supreme Court and an end
to legal abortion. Down the other lies an America in which women
are entrusted with the freedom and knowledge to make informed
choices about their reproductive lives and health.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Michelman said three of the court's nine sitting justices have
called for overturning the Roe decision. The jurists are Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and
Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   If a sufficient number of court vacancies occur, the next
president could have the opportunity to appoint enough justices to
overturn Roe, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation abounds among court observers that Rehnquist, at age
75, might retire if a Republican wins the presidency this year,
giving a GOP chief executive the opportunity to name a like-minded
jurist. Such a switch would yield no change in the three votes
against the Roe decision, as Scalia, 63, and Thomas, 51, appear
poised to remain on the bench for many more years.
</P>
<P>
   As for the other six justices, two are expected to retire within
the next several years, potentially giving the next president the
five votes needed to overturn Roe. These two justices, John Paul
Stevens, 79, and Sandra Day O'Connor, 69, have ruled in support of
abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other justices, Anthony M. Kennedy, 63, and David H.
Souter, 60, have supported Roe and are expected to remain on the
bench throughout the next president's term.
</P>
<P>
   The views of the remaining two justices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg,
66, and Stephen G. Breyer, 61, are largely unknown as they have not
had occasion to rule on the abortion issue.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The seven 1999 Texas laws that NARAL found objectionable do the
following:
</P>
<P>
   _ Require parents be notified before their minor daughters have
an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   _ Require parents' consent before their minor daughters receive
prescription contraceptives with state family-planning funds.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prohibit school-based health centers that receive state grants
from providing reproductive services, counseling or referrals.
</P>
<P>
   _ Deny tax exemptions to not-for-profit organizations that
perform, refer for, or assist organizations that perform or refer
for abortions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Deny reproductive services, except prenatal care and care
related to diseases, illnesses or abnormalities related to the
reproductive system, to low-income women younger than 19 who are
enrolled in the Texas Child Health Plan.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make it a felony for anyone to take a 14-, 15- or 16-year-old
out of Texas or beyond 120 miles of the child's home without
parental permission.
</P>
<P>
   _ Impose a $2,500 licensing fee on doctors' offices, a charge
that NARAL said ``needlessly'' raises the cost of an abortion.

   ARAOUANE, Mali _ The sand woman came out of the blackness of the
village master's house into the desert light, bearing a bowl of
sand her hands had scooped from the doorway and would deposit
several feet away.
</P>
<P>
   It is a lifetime's work, this struggle against the sand, for
Souda Cissey and Araouane's other sand women, a daily contest to
prevent the Sahara from burying, once and for all, this ancient
village in West Africa. The world's largest desert has already
taken away a mosque and countless houses in recent years, the
rooftops of some still visible on the sand's surface, others fallen
into the Sahara's bottomless pits.
</P>
<P>
   The sand women clear courtyards and doorways from dawn to dusk
in Araouane, the once-fabled oasis six days by camel north of
Timbuktu, the city at the desert's edge, and nine days south of the
salt mines of Taoudenni, a place so desolate and forbidding that
political prisoners were once left there and told they could dig in
return for food and water, or run away.
</P>
<P>
   But run where in the Sahara?
</P>
<P>
   The sand women work except on days when the wind is so strong
that, sweeping down as it does from the eastern dunes, it blows
over sand much faster than they could ever clear it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's easier,'' Ms. Cissey, barefoot, said, looking down at
the ever-widening space she had cleared before the entrance. ``The
further you get away from the door, the easier it becomes. You have
less to walk.''
</P>
<P>
   The 30 families still left here have resisted the larger forces
that drove most away: the disappearance of the trans-Saharan camel
caravan, which once served as the main method of trade with the
African interior; the desertification that began with the severe
droughts of the early 1970s and killed the shrubbery necessary to
raise cattle; a rebellion against the Malian government by desert
nomads in the early 1990s that doomed a New Yorker's quixotic
attempt to plant trees in Araouane.
</P>
<P>
   So today, dunes cresting at 40 feet surround this village about
160 miles north of Timbuktu. Smaller dunes have formed inside the
village in the areas between the mud-brick houses, which seem to be
sinking deeper and deeper into the depressions. Sand rises as high
as the rooftops of many houses, whose owners clear only the
entrance. At other houses belonging to people too weak or old to
clear the sand, or too poor to hire the sand women, the inhabitants
must step down from the sand into their homes.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired,'' said Bela Bilali, an old man, though perhaps not
the 90 years he claimed to be. ``But what can I do except keep
removing the sand? I rest, then I get up again.''
</P>
<P>
   As his 2-year-old grandson stood beside him sucking on a piece
of raw lamb fat, the old man lay on a pile of sand in front of his
mud house. Although he could not recall the details, he said he had
lost two or three houses to the sand in recent years, the last one
when the wind blew for three straight weeks. Undefeated, he had
rebuilt on the same spot.
</P>
<P>
   Across his house, two other old men, laying still on the sand
and wrapped in blankets to shield themselves against the wind and
sand, told similar tales of lost houses.
</P>
<P>
   Abdi Sultan, a Muslim holy man in his 70s, only his wizened face
showing, recalled that in his youth there were more than 100 houses
here. Many used to be built close together in rows, he said. But
the houses at the ends would bear most of the sand; the homeowners
in the middle invariably refused to help clear the sand, so the
entire row would eventually be buried. Nowadays, houses are built
far apart from one another.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   People are believed to have settled in Araouane even before
Timbuktu was founded in the 11th century. The nomadic Berbers known
as the Tuaregs chose this spot because of its wells and grass for
their cattle, said Abdi Mohammed, imam of one of the three
remaining mosques. The Moors, a people of mixed Berber and Arab
descent, eventually took over the area and brought Islam. They also
brought black slaves from the south to take care of animals and
perform other tasks in a rigid hierarchy that survives to this day.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 3,000 people are thought to have lived here once,
Mohammed said. Now there are only a couple of hundred souls, who
depend entirely on passersby or trips to Timbuktu for food. ``The
people who have decided to stay in Araouane,'' the imam said,
``will stay until the end of their lives or until the end of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, the village served as a stopping point on the
camel caravan trade centered in Timbuktu. Traders brought salt from
the north and exchanged it for gold from the African interior.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the salt is almost worthless, though worth enough to send
Araouane's young black men to dig in the Taoudenni mines during the
current cool season. Moorish or Tuareg traders leading caravans of
30 to 40 camels, with each beast carrying four salt tablets
weighing several hundred pounds in all, pass through Araouane
almost daily on their way down to Timbuktu.
</P>
<P>
   Hamane Hilla, an irrepressibly cheerful man in his 70s, recalled
how he had dug in the Taoudenni mines until he was in his 50s and
his body could no longer stand it.
</P>
<P>
   The Moors, who controlled the mines and remain Araouane's
masters, would advance the miners credit _ less than $10 for five
months' work being the standard, he said. The miners worked six
days a week for their bosses, but were permitted to keep the salt
from the seventh day. Still, the Moors deducted whatever food or
water the miners consumed from their advances, so the miners
usually fell into debt, which sometimes took years to repay.
</P>
<P>
   But things have improved, Hilla said. His son is digging in
Taoudenni now and has been promised more than $40 for four months'
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not have his luck,'' Hilla said, smiling, his face
turned away from the blowing wind. ``I'm an old man now. I can't go
to Taoudenni, I can't go to Timbuktu. I can't do anything but go to
the mosque and pray.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It was on an aborted trip to Taoudenni in 1988 that an American
named Ernst Aebi, a surrealist painter from Manhattan, stumbled
upon Araouane. In his book ``Seasons of Sand'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster,
1993), Aebi wrote that after being struck by the village's
wretchedness, he planted trees to stop the encroaching Sahara, grew
a communal garden and built a school and even a hotel, which he
called the Araouane Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought the American had come to save us,'' said Chirach
Hamma, 27, who learned French in the school.
</P>
<P>
   But the development coincided with a growing rebellion against
the Malian government by the Tuareg nomads. The Tuaregs and Moors,
who proved the most resistant to Westernization under French
colonialism, found themselves marginalized after Mali's
independence in 1960. The descendants of the blacks, who had been
their slaves and received French education, now controlled the
national government and were not particularly open to their
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Tuareg rebels raided and destroyed villages in the Sahara. Peace
came in 1995 but only after the destruction of Aebi's projects.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the last couple of years, improvements have come to Araouane.
Italians built a school; the Red Cross, a dispensary.
</P>
<P>
   El Hadje Ahmed, 27, a nurse whom everyone refers to as the
doctor, arrived here in October from his hometown, Timbuktu. The
Red Cross regularly sends supplies, though the locals continue to
practice traditional medicine, which includes stuffing nostrils
with camel dung to fight colds and placing it against an aching
tooth.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed's father, a doctor, had ordered him to Araouane. But the
young man could not wait to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Araouane was a great city!'' Ahmed said, slumped on
the porch of the dispensary. ``Oh! I'd like to go back to Timbuktu
to renew myself, if only for one month. Go out dancing with my
girlfriends. I could never convince any of them to come here.
They'll see there's no dancing here, that all the women are
covered. My girlfriends wear short skirts and they don't wear
veils!''
</P>
<P>
   He said he hated how the Sahara had left a permanent coat of
fine sand on his skin, how the grains found their way between his
teeth and into every meal he ate. He said he hated watching the
sand women's Sisyphean labor, the same sand spilling back into the
spaces they had cleared.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place is hell,'' he added with finality. '
</P>
<P>
   The sun had begun to set over Araouane, and the sand women were
collecting the bags of rice or sugar, the equivalent of $1.60, that
they are paid for a day. Jnanbarka Handou Barik is over 50 but has
never set foot outside Araouane. ``I don't know anything about
Timbuktu,'' she said, adding, ``I hope the wind doesn't come
tomorrow, so I can work.''
</P>
<P>
   Aliou Fatima Metou, the man whose doorway she had cleared, took
in the stillness of the air and predicted that there would be no
wind on this particular night. He was right.
</P>
<P>
   But in the predawn hours, before the muezzin roused the faithful
for the day's first prayer, the wind had stirred. Soon the sand
flowed gently from the eastern dunes, rustling by the houses and
doorways all over Araouane, awakening no doubt the sand women from
their sleep.

ARMEY PUTTING PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS ON FRONT BURNER 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House majority leader, Rep. Dick Armey of
Texas, predicted Thursday that Congress would pass a patients' bill
of rights this spring and send it to President Clinton by Easter
Sunday, April 23.
</P>
<P>
   But just how far those protections go, specifically on whether
patients can sue health maintenance organizations to enforce their
rights, will no doubt be contentious as Democrats and Republicans
seek the political high ground on a white-hot campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   Along with tighter gun control measures and an increased minimum
wage, a strong patients' bill of rights is a top legislative
priority for Democrats on Capitol Hill. Republicans are expected to
try to defuse these election-year issues by acting on them early
and passing more modest versions that are coupled with more
traditional Republican elements.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Armey said in a speech at a health care forum here
that any patients' bill of rights would also include a series of
tax breaks to help millions of people buy health insurance. These
provisions include the use of tax-free savings accounts to set
aside money for routine medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Armey's comment picks up where Congress left off on the
health-care issue last fall. In July, the Senate approved a bill
covering barely a quarter as many patients as a House bill and
giving them a much more limited set of rights. Then in October, the
House overwhelmingly passed a bill that would give patients a wide
range of new rights in dealing with their health insurance
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill was strongly supported by President Clinton,
almost all Democrats and 68 Republicans. But House Republican
leaders opposed the measure and made sure the Republican conferees
named to hammer out a compromise bill with the Senate were on their
side and not on the side of the bill that won the vote. The House
version also included many of the tax breaks that Armey described
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill would allow patients to sue health plans in state
courts for damages if the patients were harmed by a denial of
treatment. But Armey said Thursday he favored an alternative that
would allow patients to sue in federal court, where it is believed
the juries are less likely to return big verdicts against health
plans.
</P>
<P>
   The House-Senate conference committee may meet this month to
resume negotiations. But given the depth of support for stronger
patient protections, it is uncertain whether any compromise that
emerges could muster enough support in the House, much less the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very questionable whether you could pass it out of the
House,'' said Laura Nichols, a spokeswoman for Rep. Richard
Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democrat. who is an author of the
managed care bill that passed, said he welcomed Armey's decision to
act on the bill, but expressed concern over what the result would
be.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Thursday, Armey said the House bill would likely
include a new tax deduction for people who pay at least 50 percent
of their own health-insurance premiums.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Texas Republican also urged Congress to approve
a new tax credit for the 44 million Americans who are uninsured.
``This year Congress will place a major focus on the uninsured,''
Armey said.

STATE SEEKS EXPERT HELP IN POSSIBLE SALE OF HARVARD HMO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN AND RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Officials signaled Thursday they may consider a sale of
Harvard Pilgrim Health Care to an outside buyer, announcing they
plan to hire an investment banker to solicit proposals to
recapitalize the ailing health maintenance organization.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly said a firm would be selected
Friday and begin work immediately to provide a ``menu of options''
in 10 days for bringing Harvard Pilgrim back to health.
</P>
<P>
   Further suggesting regulators want to be prepared for a speedy
sale, Reilly said he is invoking a state rule that allows him to
take an extra measure of control over Harvard Pilgrim in the event
of a sale. The move means Reilly would oversee the possible
conversion of Harvard Pilgrim from a nonprofit to a for-profit
company.
</P>
<P>
   While he stressed regulators simply want to explore all options
_ including selling pieces of the health plan to multiple buyers,
or obtaining loans or some other form of finanancing _ the
announcement immediately sparked speculation of a for-profit buyer
and set off a firestorm of controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Trade groups, including a coalition of health-care professionals
known as the Ad Hoc Committee to Defend Health Care, unleashed a
flurry of protests. ``This would be a drastic mistake,'' Paul Ling,
a Quincy clinical psychologist who is a member of the committee,
said of a possible for-profit buyer. ``At best, it's a very
short-term solution that will present us with even greater crises
in the not-too-distant future.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State William F. Galvin said Reilly's announcement
is a ``stunning development that would change the entire landscape
of health care in Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to calm the storm, Reilly called reporters late in the
day, saying, ``I do not want to leave the impression that we are
seeking a for-profit buyer. In no way shape or form do I want to
say that we are predisposed to anything. We want to pursue every
conceivable option to recapitalize Harvard Pilgrim. That would
include for-profit and nonprofit solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, industry observers have said that other nonprofit health
plans in the state are in no financial condition to buy Harvard
Pilgrim, by far the largest plan in the state. And for all
practical purposes, buyers would be limited to large national
for-profit health insurers such as Cigna Group, based in
Philadelphia; Wellpoint Health Networks, a California HMO; United
Health Care, a Minnesota HMO; or Aetna, a health insurer based in
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Conceivably, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts might
be interested in stepping in, but most health executives say the
company does not have the financial wherewithal to pull off such a
feat.
</P>
<P>
   State regulators took control of Harvard Pilgrim Jan. 4 after
health plan officials said they discovered $58.5 million in 1999
losses that they didn't know about before. The discovery meant
Harvard Pilgrim's projected losses for the year soared to at least
$150 million, and possibly as high as $177 million.
</P>
<P>
   A judge's order mandated that state regulators come up with a
plan for bailing out the health plan within 30 days, a feat that
now looks nearly impossible, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly said Thursday that officials finally have received what
they believe is their first reliable information about Harvard
Pilgrim's daily cash flow _ an indicator of the health plan's
ability to pay its day-to-day bills.
</P>
<P>
   The report indicated that ``for now'' Harvard Pilgrim can meet
its daily obligations as well as pay some of the debts it already
owes to health providers, Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also said they have received their first indication of
the size of Harvard Pilgrim's debts, a report on the HMO's top 10
creditors and how much they are owed. That report will be shipped
to hospitals Friday to see whether the information provided by
Harvard Pilgrim squares with what hospitals say the health plan
owes. Officials declined to disclose details of the report.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, officials said 100 Harvard Pilgrim employees were
laid off Thursday. The layoffs were part of Harvard Pilgrim's
turnaround plan even before the health plan was placed in
receivership, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Hampering state officials' plans to move quickly on a Harvard
Pilgrim bailout is the disarray of its accounting systems, which is
so confusing that officials said they can't rely on it.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Reilly said he believes enough reliable information
has been cobbled together by accountants hired by the state
Insurance Division to satisfy possible buyers or lenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got enough here to solicit serious proposals,'' he said
in an interview Thursday. ``We would expect people who are serious
would want to perform their own due diligence anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, officials concede the state's timetable to receive offers
for the health plan, which has annual revenue of $2.8 billion, is
ambitious. It calls for offers that must then be evaluated and
negotiated in roughly two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly said it's unlikely that any plan would be completed
within the 30-dayne.

GATES TO FOCUS ON SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT AT MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Gates is stepping down as chief executive of Microsoft
Corp. to focus on developing technologies at the company he grew
from a two-man start-up to the world's largest software producer.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that adds to the uncertainty of the federal antitrust
case pending against Microsoft, Gates turned over the top
management post to Steve Ballmer, who also remains the company's
president.
</P>
<P>
   Gates will continue as Microsoft's chairman and will take on the
new position of chief software architect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm returning to what I love most _ focusing on technologies
for the future,'' Gates said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The transition was designed to help Microsoft beef up its
Internet-related products, said both Gates and Ballmer, who cited
the rapid pace of change in the on-line industry. They insisted the
move had nothing to do with pressure from government antitrust
attorneys who want the company to settle charges it used monopoly
practices to build its dominant market share.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vision Paul Allen and I had has certainly achieved our
dreams,'' Gates said, referring to the partner with whom he
cofounded Microsoft in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   But now the rise of the Internet has created what Gates called
an ``inflection point'' for Microsoft, at which it must recast its
software offerings. He said he could best oversee that in his new
position.
</P>
<P>
   Gates' move wasn't a major surprise to many analysts who follow
the company, at which Ballmer's responsibilities have grown
steadily since he joined in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   But it comes at a time of high tensions between the company and
state and federal attorneys. In November, US District Court Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson supported prosecutors' allegations that
Microsoft had bullied its competitors, in part by insisting on
exclusive deals and by blocking the use of competing software
products used to browse the Web. The ruling prompted Microsoft to
begin a new round of talks toward possibly settling the case.
</P>
<P>
   Recent reports have suggested government lawyers are seeking to
break the company up into several pieces, and some observers
searched for hints in the transition that Microsoft might be moving
closer to such an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But in announcing the change from the company's Redmond, Wash.,
headquarters, both Gates and Ballmer continued their public
opposition to such steps. Nor was the timing of the move related to
the government's actions, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has nothing to do with that,'' Ballmer said. Earlier he
said ``It would be reckless and irresponsible for anyone to try to
break up this company. It would be unprecedented, and the single
biggest disservice anybody could do to consumers in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the Justice Department and for Massachusetts
Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly, who has also joined the case,
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the company's denials, some observers said Gates' move
might still ease Microsoft's relations with regulators. ``This
could be a subtle message that they've removed the architect of the
company's monopoly,'' said Matthew Nordan, analyst at Forrester
Research in Cambridge, Mass. Yankee Group chief Berge Ayvazian said
Gates' step ``takes the ego out'' of negotiations and improves the
prospects of a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   But Athony Picardi, senior vice president at International Data
Corp. in Framingham, Mass., said the transition _ and Microsoft's
continued belligerance toward breakup suggestions _ represented a
missed opportunity. Picardi recently oversaw a study recommending
that, for the good of the industry, Microsoft should agree to split
itself into five operating companies each focused on different
programming areas.
</P>
<P>
   The company, however, has expressed little interest in the idea.
If anything, Picardi said, in his new position Gates will have more
power to insist that software features be sold in packages, a chief
complaint of competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Gates, 44, has become the technology industry's archnerd, and
one of the best-known executives in the world. He's also the
richest, largely due to his stake of about 15 percent in Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Operating systems he helped develop, first one known as DOS and
later the Windows systems, now power the vast majority of personal
computers.
</P>
<P>
   In books and presentations Gates has portrayed himself as a
technologist and businessman seeking only to improve the spread of
his company's products; a charitable foundation he recently
established has also given away millions of dollars in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet competitors have long criticized Microsoft for its alleged
use of its heavy market share to force bargains in his favor,
culminating in the Clinton administration's ongoing antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   Gates' departure comes just days after America Online Inc.
announced its intentions to purchase Time Warner in what would be
the largest merger ever if approved by regulators. Gates and
Ballmer noted the irony and spoke of AOL as one of the top five
competitors Microsoft faces in the Internet space.
</P>
<P>
   To boost profits, Gates and Ballmer also outlined a set of
products they called ``Next Generation Windows Services,'' which
they said would link software products more effectively via
networks and through a variety of palm-sized computers and other
devices.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer, 43, is ranked the fourth-richest American, according to
Forbes magazine, primarily from his almost 5 percent stake in
Microsoft.

GORE MAKES LITTLE HEADWAY IN COURTING IOWA FARMERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Iowa)  (Subs to add attribution in 9th graf, `... the Center for Rural
Affairs ...') 
(See also IOWA-OUTLOOK) 
(dal) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SLOAN, Iowa _ Vice President Al Gore on Thursday appealed for
support from Iowa farmers and staged an event that attacked his
opponent, former Sen. Bill Bradley, as unconcerned with the
problems of American agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore used the well-scripted meeting to promote his own
candidacy, however, local farmers used the occasion to emphasize to
Gore their own difficulties and their dissatisfaction with the
Clinton-Gore administration. Afterward, many of the farmers
grumbled that they were not happy with any of the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing blue jeans and a denim shirt, Gore stood center stage in
a barn near this tiny town in western Iowa and denounced what he
described as the ``deadly threat'' facing America's family farms.
Some farmers said it sounded odd coming from a man who has helped
run the country for the last seven years.
</P>
<P>
   The message that Gore knows Iowa's concerns best is being
reinforced in new television and radio commercials with a
testimonial by Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the floods hit in '93, Al Gore came through for us,''
Harkin says in one commercial. ``When it came to farm credit and
federal crop insurance and ethanol _ Al Gore came through for us.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds: ``In fact, Al Gore is the only Democratic candidate for
president who has been there for us in our times of need.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign had flown a New Jersey farmer, Roy Etsch, who
has 1,100 acres of corn and hay near Princeton, to Iowa to tell the
crowd in Sloan that Bradley never showed any interest in New Jersey
farmers while representing the Senate from that state. Etsch told
the audience that he had never been able to meet Bradley despite
several attempts, and added dismissively that Bradley wouldn't know
the difference between corn and soybeans.
</P>
<P>
   Etsch, who said afterward that he was a Democrat who had voted
for Bradley in each Senate election, told the crowd that Bradley
``knows nothing about agriculture and cares less.''
</P>
<P>
   It made good theater, but many of the farmers did not seem
particularly impressed. While America's economic expansion is about
to set a record for its length, farmers are facing desperate times
because of the slump in commodity prices. In the last three years,
6,000 of Iowa's 20,000 hog farmers have gone out of business, the
Center for Rural Affairs, a farm support group, said.
</P>
<P>
   Without giving exact particulars, Gore called for new farm
policies that would make payments to farmers whose prices are
cyclically depressed, for more export markets for agriculture, for
a larger exemption for family farms from the inheritance tax and
for stronger anti-trust action against large agribusiness concerns
that farmers often accuse of setting monopolistic prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't hear anything new or see that he had any answers,''
Don Hamisch, who farms alfalfa hay, said afterward. Hamisch, a
Democrat, said he was not sure who he would vote for in the
Democratic caucuses but that in the general election he would
probably vote Republican.
</P>
<P>
   During a question-answer period, some farmers asked tough
questions that were critical of the Clinton administration's
Justice Department, Agriculture Department and Trade
Representative. Whenever a skeptical question was raised, some of
the farmers would nod and whisper ``yes!''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the mood toward Gore was a bit more positive afterward
than before the meeting, and some farmers said a bit grudgingly
that he seemed to know something about their problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told us what we wanted to hear,'' said Bill Ortner, who
farms 3,000 acres of corn and soybeans and who earlier had
described himself as unhappy with all the candidates. ``He's tilted
me more to his side. And Senator Bradley is probably out of the
picture now.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore suggested in his talk that conservation programs might be
one way to increase revenue for family farmers, and many in the
audience seemed to welcome that. But many said that they were
suspicious of Gore because of his association with
environmentalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry about him being over-protective of the environment, so
that I can't do my job,'' fretted Frank Yanak, a local farmer.

AN IMPATIENT BP AMOCO TELLS FTC TO DECIDE ON ITS DEAL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif . , Alaska, Ore . )   (dal) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL JR.    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frustrated with its discussions with the Federal Trade
Commission about its plans to acquire Atlantic Richfield, BP Amoco
on Thursday took steps to force the agency to either approve the
deal or go to court.
</P>
<P>
   The action by the London-based oil giant, which said it would
invoke its right to set a 20-day deadline for the FTC to challenge
the deal, makes clear that the two sides are still far from
agreement about what the oil companies must do to satisfy
regulators. The sticking point is whether the acquisition will hurt
competition or lead to higher gasoline prices, particularly on the
West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a breakthrough, it also means the FTC is likely to go to
federal court in the next few weeks to block the $31 billion deal.
Should that happen, it would be the largest merger ever challenged
by federal antitrust regulators.
</P>
<P>
   There remains a slim chance of a settlement before that happens,
people close to the negotiations said, and lawyers from both sides
are expected to meet on Friday. But historically, the government
does not negotiate with companies once they invoke the 20-day clock
_ a deadline that BP Amoco could lift, if it chooses.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street, which has expressed doubts that the deal can be
completed, viewed BP Amoco's statement as a reaffirmation of its
commitment to the merger. Shares of BP Amoco's American depository
receipts rose 81.25 cents, to $57.375, on Thursday. The terms of
the merger value each ARCO share at 1.64 shares of BP Amoco _ or
about $94, based on Thursday's close.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of ARCO, based in Los Angeles, rose $2, to $79 _ still
far short of the merger value, making it clear that many investors
remain skeptical that the acquisition will close.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, FTC staff members urged that the merger be blocked _
a recommendation that analysts who follow the agency say would have
been made only if the staff members believed it would have the
support of the commission's chairman, Robert Pitofsky.
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky has not commented on this deal, but he has previously
expressed concerns that the oil industry has become too heavily
concentrated in recent years, following a spate of mergers and
joint marketing agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute about BP Amoco's deal for ARCO focuses on the effect
the merger will have in California and other Western states.
California, in particular, already has much higher gas prices than
other parts of the country. In November, Bill Lockyer, the state's
attorney general, reported that Californians paid an average of 26
cents more for a gallon of gas in the first eight months of 1999
than other Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the deal say they fear the acquisition will drive
gasoline prices even higher. They contend that since BP Amoco and
ARCO, combined, own the bulk of the oil produced from Alaska's
North Slope, and since the West Coast gets much of its gasoline
from Alaska, the merged company would have too much control over
Alaskan oil. They also note that ARCO has traditionally been a
low-priced competitor in California, and they contend that such
positioning would end if it is acquired.
</P>
<P>
   But the companies, which believe they have a strong case should
the FTC take them o court, contend that West Coast prices are set
by the world oil markets, not by Alaskan production _ an opinion
shared by several analysts. Supporters of the deal also say that
the higher California gas prices are primarily caused by taxes, a
requirement for special clean gasoline, and other factors. They
further note that BP Amoco has agreed to cut re of North
Slope oil from about 70 percent to 55 percent by divesting 175,000
barrels of daily oil production.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement on Thursday, BP Amoco said it ``remains ready to
pursue a constructive solution.'' But the company also said it
firmly believed ``the combination would enlarge rather than
adversely affect competition,'' and that it had ``offered, but
failed to get FTC acceptance for, a range of measures designed to
meet the FTC's expressed concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   One proposal that had been offered, the company said, would be
to allocate an additional 210,000 barrels of daily production to
third-party buyers under long-term contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Commission Officials had no comment on Thursday about BP Amoco's
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks the agency has been lobbied heavily on the
matter. Alaskan officials, including the governor, Tony Knowles,
now favor the deal, following BP Amoco's agreement to divest itself
of part of its daily production and to make other concessions.
Knowles, a Democrat, has been pressing the FTC to approve the
acquisition; otherwise, he has said, further delay will hurt the
Alaskan economy.
</P>
<P>
   But others, including a number of state officials in California
and Oregon, remain concerned that gas prices will rise unless far
more substantial steps are taken.

BUSH REASSURES NEW HAMPSHIRE VOTERS

   PORTSMOUTH, N.H. _ Locked in a tight race with John McCain for
the state's first-in-the-nation primary, George W. Bush felt
compelled Thursday to reassure New Hampshire Republicans that he
wasn't taking their votes for granted.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, meanwhile, who has been campaigning virtually nonstop in
New Hampshire, addressed the state Legislature and promised to
shake up Washington by appointing a ``reform czar'' who would be
directed to make federal agencies more responsive to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was met in New Hampshire on Thursday with a front-page
story in the Concord Monitor questioning his commitment to the New
Hampshire primary because of the few days he has spent campaigning
in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the people of New Hampshire to understand that I'm in a
fight with a friend,'' Bush told several hundred people at a Rotary
Club luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am in a battle for the votes, and I don't want anyone to
think I'm taking anything for granted. I've got a lot of work to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Bush promised to spend half of January campaigning
in New Hampshire. But the first week of January he spent two days
in New Hampshire; this week and next, he will spend only one full
day.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said Thursday that Bush plans 10 more
days in the state, including the week between the Iowa caucuses
Jan. 24 and the new Hampshire primary Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show a neck-and-neck race between the Texas governor and
McCain, a senator from Arizona, who has staked almost his entire
campaign on a New Hampshire victory.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he would appoint a reform czar who would be a
Cabinet-level official similar to the drug czar, who now
coordinates drug policy among federal agencies. McCain said the
goal of the new office would be to ``coordinate, emphasize, kick
ass'' in the federal bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``As president, reform of our public institutions to restore the
public confidence of the people we are sworn to serve will be my
first priority,'' McCain told the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   McCain attributed the problems of local lawmakers to the
wasteful spending of Congress, which he said budgeted money for
projects sought by special interests rather than the needs of
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are the victims of pork barrel politics of Washington and
it must stop,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, speaking to reporters while standing in a snowstorm,
suggested his executive experience in Texas better equipped him for
the White House than did McCain's legislative experience in
Washington as an Arizona senator. And Bush again contrasted the
candidates' tax-cut plans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he believed the ``two deciding issues'' for New
Hampshire voters would be his and McCain's experience and ``whether
they want to spend more money (on government programs) or send it
back to the taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has proposed a $483 billion, five-year tax cut and McCain,
a $237 billion, five-year plan. Bush contends McCain's proposal
would leave too much money in Washington for Congress to spend on
unneeded programs. McCain counters that Bush spends too much of the
surplus when the government needs to reduce its debt and shore up
Social Security for the baby-boomers' retirement.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also addressed federal spending in previewing his
education plan, which he will unveil next week. He said it differed
with Bush's in that his does not cut off federal funding to
poor-performing schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because they (schools) got an F doesn't mean they deserve
to lose their funds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also sought to associate McCain with Vice President Al
Gore, the Democratic presidential front-runner, on the tax issue.
Bush said that when he laid out his tax plan ``two voices _ Al Gore
and John McCain _ said it didn't leave enough money in
Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush answered several questions from audiences at all three New
Hampshire stops.
</P>
<P>
   In Laconia, one plant worker asked the governor how he would
distinguish his presidency from that of his father, former
President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I've got half my mother in me,'' Bush quipped. But he
dodged a direct answer to the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll let history judge, if I become the president, between
the differences between he and me,'' he said. ``I can't tell you
how proud I am of him. It's a fair question, but I would give you
such an unfair answer, because I'm so subjective.''

GATES STEPS ASIDE AS CHIEF OF MICROSOFT BUT WILL REMAIN CHAIRMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF with STEVE LOHR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Bill Gates stepped aside as chief executive of
Microsoft on Thursday, after a quarter-century of running the
company day to day, and gave that role to his longtime partner
Steven Ballmer, the company's president.
</P>
<P>
   Gates will remain as chairman and said he would take on a new
role as ``chief software architect,'' declaring his conviction that
``in the revolution ahead of us, software will be at the center.''
</P>
<P>
   That vision is in contrast to the thinking behind this week's
merger announcement by America Online and Time Warner, a gamble
that content will play a paramount role in a digital era.
</P>
<P>
   Gates said that in his new role he would seek to create a new
kind of software system harnessing large computing systems, desktop
personal computers and a proliferating array of consumer electronic
devices, all connected to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Gates, upbeat and intense, offered no hint that fatigue or
weariness had weighed in the decision. He said the shift in effect
completed an evolution begun a year and half ago when he named
Ballmer president of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day when you go home you're thinking,
thinking, thinking about how the different pieces of the company
come together,'' Gates said in an interview, and the move will free
him to devise strategy without worrying about day-to-day business.
</P>
<P>
   It is the unusually close relationship between Gates, 44, and
Ballmer, 43, forged in their Harvard undergraduate days, that will
make the organizational changes work, Ballmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer dropped out of business school at Stanford University to
join Gates at Microsoft in 1980 and has played a variety of roles
at the company, frequently driving its marketing and sales efforts.
He was named president in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a personal level, the kind of relationship that Bill and I
have must be totally unique in the business world,'' he said. ``The
times Microsoft has been faced with challenges is the time we have
done our best work.''
</P>
<P>
   On the most crucial challenge, the antitrust case brought by the
federal government and 19 states, there has been little progress
toward a negotiated settlement, and the two sides have rarely even
met face-to-face, people close to the talks said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   They said the Justice Department and the states were
increasingly leaning toward a severe ``structural'' remedy _
breaking up the company or forcing it to license its software to
rivals. Still, such remedies could take many forms, they said, and
the plaintiffs have not settled firmly on a single, preferred
remedy.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about press reports that the government would seek to
break Microsoft into two or three separate companies, Ballmer said
such a move would be ``reckless beyond belief'' and would harm
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer said he would be ``the point man'' in the company's
decision-making in the settlement talks but that Gates would
continue to be involved.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the press conference, Ballmer went to some
lengths to emphasize the challenge from Microsoft's competitors,
citing Sun Microsystems, IBM, Oracle, the free Linux operating
system, and pointedly included AOL and Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the conference, he was asked whether he thought
Microsoft needed to seek a big merger partner itself, as America
Online had. ``Our business is focused in on software, and I don't
anticipate the need for megamergers to accomplish what we want to
do in software,'' Ballmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he added jokingly, ``Half of you guys want to break us up
and the other half wants us to do a megamerger.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the competition, Gates sketched a world view revolving
around the company's software in a variety of guises. In that world
the personal computer will be the most important platform, but
Microsoft software will extend both upward toward large computing
services and down to home appliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're bold enough to think that even reading e-books will be
part of the next generation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The new strategy as outlined by Gates and Ballmer is in essence
a bet on creating an Internet operating system, integrating the
disparate parts of the Internet in somewhat the way programs are
now integrated in a single PC.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, that may hold the promise of ease of use; for
Microsoft, it offers the prospect that its software will be at the
center of the Internet universe as it is in the PC world.
</P>
<P>
   In doing this Microsoft is engaged in a titanic tug-of-war with
its Internet competitors, many of whom are trying to build similar
strategies. For example, last week Steve Jobs, the chief executive
of Apple Computer, outlined a similar strategy, introducing a range
of new Internet services that will be delivered to Macintosh
computer users from the company's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the new software strategy sketched out by
Gates and Ballmer also aims to capture an increasing share of the
most rapidly growing part of the Internet: software that connects
businesses to other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense the new strategy is a second generation of the
turn that Microsoft made in 1995 when it rapidly reorganized itself
to address the first stage of the Internet challenge, when the
advent of the Web browser threatened the primacy of the Windows
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Now the company is responding to a growing set of smaller
competitors that are using Internet standard software based on a
next-generation Web technology known as XML to develop systems that
link businesses and their applications.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer said the strategy would revolve around a new set of
applications and centralized services he referred to as Next
Generation Windows Services. He gave examples in the health care
and travel industries, where software would let people change the
way they interact with medical providers and get many automated
information services to help them with their travel planning and
actual travel.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer, who will also join the board, said that the new focus
for Microsoft would permit the company to continue the dramatic
growth that it has achieved since Gates founded Microsoft with his
childhood friend Paul G. Allen in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the opportunity to repeat in the 21st century the kind
of progress we made in the last quarter century,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Sherlund, an analyst for Goldman Sachs, said elevating
Ballmer was an ``evolutionary step.'' And Sherlund said he took
Gates' explanation at face value _ that Gates intends to be fully
committed to Microsoft, though in a different role.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Gates, I believe that this is about making the Internet
work for Microsoft,'' Sherlund said. ``That's where his heart is.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft shares closed at $107, but rose slightly in
after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he actually intended to write software code, Gates said
he would probably only ``threaten'' to do so. But he said he would
work closely with the company's software development tools to
better understand the challenge of programming.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Gates said they believed that he would have no
trouble stepping away from his day-to-day management and
deal-making duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'd be genetically unable to back away from running my
business,'' said the renowned investor Warren Buffett, a friend of
Gates. ``But Bill will do it. He is just that sort of a fellow. And
Microsoft will get much more value from him. He will spend his time
thinking while Steve marshals the troops and charges ahead.''

<P>
   For the first time since AIDS was discovered nearly 20 years
ago, more black and Hispanic gay men were diagnosed with AIDS than
white gay men over a year's period, federal health officials
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 18,153 AIDS cases were diagnosed among gay men in
1998, the most recent year available, and blacks and Hispanics
represented 9,182, or 51 percent, of the cases, the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention said in its weekly report. This
compares with 8,678 cases, or 48 percent, for white gay men. Black
gay men made up one-third of all AIDS cases among gays, Hispanics
18 percent and Asian and Pacific Islanders 1 percent of the cases
in that year, the centers said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the AIDS epidemic began, most AIDS cases have been among
gay men, and white gay men have made up the largest subgroup. But
through the years the percentages have steadily risen for black and
Hispanic gay men as those for white gay men decreased.
</P>
<P>
   For example, for the years from 1989 to 1998, the percentage of
AIDS cases diagnosed among black and Hispanic gay men rose to 51
from 30, and for white gay men it dropped to 48 from 69.
</P>
<P>
   CDC officials said that the new figures were the strongest
evidence yet of the magnitude of the epidemic among black and
Hispanic gay men, and they said the shift was the result of a
number of factors. One was that white gay men organized to educate
themselves about the use of condoms and other prevention measures,
while minority groups largely ignored the issue of infection with
HIV, the AIDS virus, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Stigma about homosexuality seems to be playing a major role in
the spread of infection with HIV, and the stigma may be even
greater among blacks and Hispanics than it is among whites, said
Dr. Helene Gayle, who heads HIV program at the centers.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a CDC survey of 8,780 HIV-infected men who had sex with
men found that many infected black and Hispanic gay men who said
they became HIV-infected from sex with other men did not identify
themselves as homosexual or bisexual. Of those surveyed, 24 percent
of black and 15 percent of Hispanic men who said they had sex with
men identified themselves as being heterosexual compared with 6
percent among a similar group of white men.
</P>
<P>
   By not considering themselves at high risk for AIDS, black and
Latino gay men may not seek or receive the HIV prevention and
treatment services they need and may unintentionally put their male
and female sex partners at risk, Dr. Gayle said in a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   CDC, the federal agency in Atlanta charged with tracking and
preventing the spread of AIDS in the United States, also found that
gay and bisexual black and Hispanic men became infected at an
earlier age than white gay men.
</P>
<P>
   The findings underscore the need for intensifying prevention
efforts among blacks and Hispanics, particularly those who may be
poor and lack access to health care, CDC officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The news ``will surprise many people across the nation who think
the gay AIDS epidemic is a totally white one,'' Dr. Gayle said.
But, she added, ``the surprise is that people are surprised''
because people have ignored this trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did not need to happen,'' said Phil Wilson of the African
American AIDS Policy and Training Institute at the University of
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said that more black churches, fraternities, sororities,
civic organizations and civil rights groups needed to speak out on
AIDS. Wilson said he was shocked that there was so little about
this issue in black media.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rafael Campo of Beth Israel Deaconness Medical Center in
Boston, added, ``Today's shocking data are merely a harbinger of
worse news to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo said that when the Harvard AIDS Institute invited
prominent Hispanic sports, entertainment and health leaders and
elected officials to a summit on AIDS in the Hispanic community
similar to one held by the black community, ``quite sadly'' only
one person came. ``It was quite astonishing to see the silence in
action when we were trying to develop initiatives in the face of
these incredibly shocking statistics,'' Campo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the congressmen we invited represent districts that
have among the highest AIDS rates in nation and none of them
came,'' Campo said without naming them.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings come from continuing analyses of AIDS cases
reported to the CDC from all states and territories for the decade
from 1989 through 1998, the latest full year for which data are
available.
</P>
<P>
   Since powerful new drug treatments became available in 1996, the
number of AIDS cases and deaths have declined among all gay men.
However, declines have not been as steep among black and Hispanic
gay and bisexual men compared with white gay and bisexual men,
suggesting possible differences in access to care.

   Gov. George W. Bush's lead over Steve Forbes, his nearest

likely Republican caucus-goers, a new poll shows. The survey,
conducted for a group of Midwestern television stations, put Bush
at 46.3 percent and Forbes at 17.3 percent. That margin is 6 points
less than the previous poll taken for the stations, in November.
The poll of 300 likely Republican caucus voters, taken on Monday by

X-RAYS BRING CLUES ABOUT EARLIEST OF GALAXIES AND ANCIENT BLACK
HOLES

<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a discovery that could help explain the origin of
the earliest galaxies, a new astronomy satellite has detected the
first discrete objects in the mysterious glow of X-rays that
pervades the distant universe.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the faintest of the radiation sources, astronomers said,
could be the most distant objects ever observed. They promise to be
important clues to conditions in the cosmic dark age, the period
that began soon after the Big Bang created the universe and lasted
until the emergence of a multitude of stars that gave light to the
firmament, perhaps a billion years.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the X-rays appear to be emanating from the cores of
galaxies. These cores, being seen now as they existed in the early
universe, were probably supermassive black holes sucking in gas at
nearly the speed of light and generating tremendous radiation. Yet
in many cases the objects do not emit visible light, suggesting
that they existed at a time before the multitude of stars.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery, reported here Thursday at a meeting of the
American Astronomical Society, was hailed by scientists as the
first major step in solving the mystery of the pervasive X-rays
that form a backdrop throughout the universe. Until the launching
of NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory five months ago, the mystery
had defied explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all very excited by this finding,'' said Richard
Mushotzky of the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., who
was the leader of the discovery team. ``These are signposts of the
first things formed in the universe.''
</P>
<P>
   Other astronomers called it ``a major discovery'' and said the
data appeared to be impressive, although they wanted to see more
observations by the Chandra spacecraft and the orbiting Hubble
Space Telescope, as well as by ground-based telescopes, to
understand the phenomenon fully.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are probing further and further into the past of galaxy
formation and how that happened,'' said Virginia Trimble, an
astronomer at the University of California at Irvine, who was not a
member of the discovery team.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing the implications of the findings at a news
conference, Ms. Trimble said the objects showed for the first time
what is creating the X-ray background in space and also revealed
that this background radiation is not perfectly smooth but instead
marked by subtle fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
   That could give astronomers an opening for new investigations
into one of the most fundamental unanswered questions in cosmology:
How did matter created in the aftermath of the Big Bang, once all
but uniformly smooth, get to be as lumpy as it is now in a universe
of large-scale structures like galaxies and spreading clusters of
galaxies?
</P>
<P>
   Learning more about the X-ray objects, Ms. Trimble said, should
give astronomers important insights into the transition, which must
have occurred during the cosmic dark age, all but unobservable
until now. The only earlier phenomenon previously observed was
microwave background radiation, a relic of the Big Bang itself,
which bears only the faintest traces of incipient galactic
structure. After the dark age, which may have lasted a billion
years or so, came the appearance of star-studded galaxies.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings, however, along with other research reported at
the astronomy meeting, suggest that relatively starless galaxies
may have been emerging everywhere during the dark age.
</P>
<P>
   In this interpretation, masses of gas and also dark matter, the
exotic particles created by the Big Bang that are thought to be a
major cosmic constituent, plumped together into proto-galaxies. At
the cores of at least some, the masses were so great that they
formed black holes, those awesome gravitational sinks so dense
that, by the rules of Einstein's general theory of relativity,
nothing, not even light, can escape them. As ravenous black holes
consumed more gas, they produced the X-rays now being observed and
marking the locations of those galactic cores.
</P>
<P>
   If this interpretation is correct, then the X-ray observations
suggest that galaxy formation and black holes preceded the period
of star formation, a possibility raised by theorists in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   An article describing the X-ray discovery is to be published
soon in the journal Nature by Mushotzky of Goddard and his
collaborators: Lennox Cowie and Amy Barger of the University of
Hawaii and Keith Arnaud of the University of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The Chandra observatory, a 12,000-pound spacecraft in Earth
orbit, was designed to examine X-ray sources much fainter and more
distant than before. The newly described X-ray background was
observed for almost 28 hours last month through use of the
spacecraft's imaging spectrometer. The instrument was built for the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration by the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and Pennsylvania State University.
</P>
<P>
   Mushotzky's team looked at a small sector of the sky, a circle
about one-fifth the size of a full moon. The researchers were able
to resolve about 80 percent of the X-ray glow in that region into
specific light sources. Extrapolated across the entire sky, this
would add up to about 70 million sources, most of which are
galaxies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In their report, the astronomers said that one-third of the
detected sources were presumably proto-galaxies: their cores bright
in X-rays, yet no visible light from them has been picked up by the
Keck Observatory in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Another type of these sources appeared to be extremely faint.
They emitted little or no visible light either because they were
obscured by dust or they were so far away that the light was
absorbed by intervening matter on its long journey across space.
</P>
<P>
   In the latter case, Mushotzky said, it may mean that the X-ray
objects are as much as 14 billion light-years away and thus the
earliest, most distant objects ever observed.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the ultimate interpretation of the discovery, Mushotzky
said, ``We're changing the demographics of black holes _ their
masses, distribution, how much matter they are eating.''

FOR BOTH FRONT-RUNNERS AND POTENTIAL SPOILERS, IOWA COULD BE
CRUCIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PERRY, Iowa _ Over the years, the Iowa caucuses have made some
presidential candidates (like Jimmy Carter in 1976) and unmade
others (like Steve Forbes in 1996). But this time, they have seemed
like a warm-up bout compared with the ballyhooed main event in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   That may be changing. With only 10 days left until Jan. 24, when
tens of thousands of Iowans will assemble in living rooms, clubs
and school halls to declare their preferences, two well-funded,
well-organized underdogs _ Forbes and Bill Bradley _ have
accelerated their efforts. If not to defeat their respective
rivals, Al Gore and George W. Bush, they hope to come close enough
to get a lift as they move to New Hampshire, whose critical primary
takes place only eight days later on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Their task is difficult, not only because many potential caucus
participants, in small towns like Perry as well as cities like Des
Moines, find no great differences among the various candidates on
major issues, but also because most Iowans have shared in the
national prosperity of recent years. Insurgents struggle when times
are good, and Iowa has staged its big upsets in years when jobs
were scarce or the parties were split on ideological lines.
</P>
<P>
   But Iowans often make up their minds at the last minute, and
polls suggest that they have not made their final caucus decisions
yet.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics is Muzak to a lot of people,'' said David Yepsen, the
chief political reporter for the Des Moines Register. ``They don't
pay attention until they have to, and that's getting later and
later. In the governor's race last year, Tom Vilsack came from 25
points behind in the last three weeks to win by five points.''
</P>
<P>
   In this year's Democratic contest, Bradley, a former senator
from New Jersey, has decided to devote all or part of every day
until the caucuses to campaigning in Iowa. A certain languor still
marks his personal style, and he still tries to cast himself as a
different kind of politician, who accentuates the positive. One day
this week, he bent his 6-foot, 5-inch frame around a lectern and
chatted for half an hour with schoolchildren about health.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley's words in other contexts have taken on an edge,
whether he is accusing Gore of neglecting the interests of Iowa
farmers, many of whom have been left behind in the Clinton-era
boom, or attacking him as a reliable friend of the big tobacco
companies.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The latest Iowa poll, taken by the Des Moines Register and
published last Saturday, showed Gore 21 percentage points ahead of
Bradley, about the same margin found in a survey taken last
November. But many of the state's most experienced politicians
think the contest is a good deal closer than that.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 percent of the delegates elected this month will
probably be undecided. If the remaining 90 percent are split 60-30
between Gore and Bradley, in that order, the former senator will be
severely hurt. But if Bradley could get 40 percent or better, said
Democratic state chairman Rob Tully, ``that would send him off to
New Hampshire with some momentum, and he'd be able to say that half
the Iowa Democrats had rejected a sitting vice president of their
own party.''
</P>
<P>
   The popular Gov. Thomas Vilsack, a Democrat who has taken no
stance in the Bradley-Gore fight, said that younger voters, many of
whom have never before taken part in the caucuses, are drawn to
Bradley. Across the state, he added, Gore supporters, including the
governor's own wife, Christie, are feeling the heat.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Gore is going to stop at our house in Mt. Pleasant for an
event my wife is hosting next week,'' Vilsack said. ``The fact that
Tipper feels that she has to do that, when Christie is already out
there working for the vice president, shows the kind of deep
inroads Bradley is making.''
</P>
<P>
   So does Vilsack expect an upset? ``Not if you define an upset as
winning,'' he replied. ``I don't think so. The party leadership and
the traditional caucus-goers are too committed to the vice
president. They'll turn out no matter what _ snow or rain, no
matter what the weather is.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As always, the weather will count. Only the most committed
venture out on frosty midwinter nights, and even fewer if it snows
or sleets. The effect is much more substantial than it might be in
a primary, when voters cast their ballots in daylight hours,
usually much closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Gifford, a longtime labor activist in Iowa who is closely
identified with Democratic politics, is backing Gore this year. But
he worries about elderly voters, many of them Gore supporters, in a
state with the nation's third oldest electorate, average age 51.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore needs the seniors to turn up on caucus night,'' Gifford
said. ``If there's an ice storm and they don't come out, and
Bradley's youngsters do, you could get a swing of 15 to 20 percent,
which is a whole lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who is saturating television with an estimated $800,000
in commercials, has moved a cadre of young organizers into Iowa,
many of them trained at Participation 2000, a campaign school at
which Bradley has lectured. But Gore is not likely to be
out-organized, not with the United Auto Workers and the National
Education Association in his corner.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley has a solid enough organization to guarantee a
good turnout in places like Dubuque and Cedar Rapids, say
Democratic pros, Gore has capable teams in place almost everywhere.
And Gore volunteers in a Waterloo boiler room made more than 30,000
telephone calls statewide just in the last week.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Iowans will respond is a matter of disagreement.
Politicians say that barring really foul weather, they expect the
usual turnout, about 100,000 in each party. But Professor Hugh
Winebrenner of Drake University, a caucus historian, said he
expected a smaller participation, perhaps 80,000 for the Democrats
and 85,000 for the Republicans, largely because ``neither a
candidate or an issue has caught fire.'' Not that the candidates
have not tried; Republican candidates, by his count, have spent a
total of 558 days in Iowa since January 1997, and Democratic
candidates have spent 149.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican figure is a record, Winebrenner said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Travel around the state, and voter enthusiasm seems muted, to
say the least. Here in Perry, a trim little town of 7,300, set amid
the deep black soil of rich farmlands, only 3 of 12 people
interviewed at random said they planned to attend the caucuses this
year, and only one piece of political advertising was evident _ a
big ``George W. Bush'' placard at a crossroads south of town.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Hotel Pattee, a magnificently restored Arts and
Crafts gem, one farmer said, ``I've pretty much lost faith in
politics.'' Another said, ``I'll go, I guess, because I always
have, since I was 21, but I don't think it'll change much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the candidates think they're important,'' said Colette
Wortman, 62, a payroll supervisor at a Des Moines insurance company
who does not plan to attend a caucus. ``They are here to get a
vote, and they don't care about you after you vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Camille Wanna, 31, a stockbroker, said he detected ``a lot of
apathy,'' largely because most people think the outcome ``is going
to be a slam dunk for Bush and Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting at Coe College on Wednesday, Craig Wood, a student,
told Gore, ``I'm concerned about your ability to win.'' But few
potential participants said their preferences would be affected by
national polls showing Bradley with a better chance than Gore to
defeat the Republican nominee. Stan Gore, 44, a systems analyst
with the Principal Financial Group, said he planned to vote for
Gore at a caucus, even though he thought the vice president might
well lose to Bush in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On the face of things, Bush seems to have little to fear from
Forbes in Iowa, and his main rival in New Hampshire, Sen. John
McCain of Arizona, is skipping Iowa _a tactic that has often
backfired in the past. Forbes trails badly in all the polls. Kayne
Robinson, the Republican state chairman, said that ``if someone is
going to make a run at Bush, the time is now, starting with the
next television debate on Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   After a monthlong absence, Forbes returned to the state Tuesday,
and he started an extensive bus tour Thursday. Announcing that
``we're here for the next two weeks,'' he launched a new television
onslaught with a graphic commercial focusing on abortion. It
includes an ultrasound image of a fetus and a woman saying, ``If
someone kills a pet, it's called a crime. If someone aborts a
child, it's called a choice.'' Forbes is relying heavily on
television; he outspent Bush last year by 3-to-2.
</P>
<P>
   But neither he nor the other Republican candidates _ Sen. Orrin
Hatch of Utah, Alan Keyes and Gary Bauer _ has been able to deny
Bush the support of some of the leaders of the state's powerful
anti-abortion forces. Ione Dilley and Paul Carbone, two influential
figures, have sided with Bush, although others have thrown their
support elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the candidates are more or less acceptable to
mainstream Republicans here,'' Robinson said. ``There's no clear
differentiation of philosophy, less than ever before. So people ask
themselves, `Which Republican is most likely to stand up there next
January and take the oath of office?' Most think George Bush is the
answer to that question.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' not-so-secret weapon is his organization, which
Winebrenner called ``one of the best I've ever seen.'' His aides
are also playing the expectations game, suggesting that Bush needs
to get at least half the vote to be considered a winner _ no easy
target, of course, with so many candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But Iowa results can take odd bounces. In 1984, former Vice
President Walter Mondale took half the vote, but headlines went to
Gary Hart, whose 16 percent was described as a significant
``victory'' for him.
</P>
<P>
   In 2000, a strong Forbes showingin Iowa might not help him so
much in New Hampshire, but softening up Bush might ultimately
benefit McCain.

 &HT;    Gates announces new CEO at Microsoft
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The handwriting was on the wall, but it took the
passing of the CEO torch from Bill Gates to Steve Ballmer on
Thursday to bring it into focus.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer, in particular, has been hinting for months that such a
shake-up was in the works and that the impetus for it would be
Microsoft's push away from the desktop and into the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Gates' stepping away from the day-to-day management of the
company and into a role as ``chief software architect'' is aimed at
just that _ creating more and better software that will put the
Internet into the hands of everyman.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Ballmer was the keynote speaker to a packed house
at the giant telecommunications conference SuperComm at the Georgia
World Congress Center.
</P>
<P>
   He told the telecom executives that the key to
telecommunications in the 21st century would eventually lie in
software provided by Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   What was so fascinating about that speech is that it was so
eerily similar to the pitch Ballmer and Gates made to IBM in the
1980s. They told IBM that while Big Blue may have the hardware to
put a computer on every desktop, without software _ software from
Microsoft _ the desktop PC would be worthless.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer told the telecommunications mavens that they may have
the dial tone and the infrastructure, but what they don't have are
the tools to make the Internet a rewarding experience for
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, he said, was the key to solving the problems of the
telecommunications industry as it worked to bring broadband (high
speed) communications to the masses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are convinced the nature of what we do is more influenced
by broadband than anything else going,'' he said. ``We just want to
see these services deployed. I'm very focused and serious about the
need for speed.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, there was a good deal of speculation that Microsoft
would sell its Internet arm, Microsoft Network. In fact, Atlanta's
Charles Brewer, CEO of MindSpring, had tossed out the comment that
he'd like to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the company
had no intention of selling MSN, and that, in fact, there were
plans for extensive growth.
</P>
<P>
   In other interviews during the ensuing months, Ballmer stressed
over and over how the Internet was the key to Microsoft's future
and that parts of the company needed to be changed to accommodate
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to do my best to see that the company is successful,
and there are parts of our business that need to be shifted and
reinvented,'' he told the Irish Times while on a European tour last
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we've done this year is talked about the
reinvention of the company around the new vision.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked where the company should go next, he said, ``This
next generation Web platform is just a huge opportunity. Think of
Windows as just a part of it. Think of it as a new thing called
i-Windows _ it's a client and it's a server, and it's a set of
services that live out on the Internet. It's a building block.
That's what we're known for.''
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's news conference, Ballmer and Gates made their
roles clear, and, in many ways, they haven't changed at all.
Ballmer will be the salesman, Gates the engineer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been chatting with Steve and the board with (the idea of)
getting myself focused on products for a couple of years,'' said
Gates.
</P>
<P>
   The switch comes after Ballmer has been effectively running the
company for several years (he became president officially in 1998).
</P>
<P>
   ``Their change in strategy was already under way prior to the
change at the top,'' Summit Strategies analyst Dwight Davis told
C/Net, a Web site that covers technology news.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is changing around Microsoft. (People are moving
toward) hosted applications and away from deploying software on
local machines. Microsoft has struggled with this internally for
more than a year, knowing this transition is under way.''

   SCI-OLD-BLACKHOLES (Atlanta) _ In a discovery that could help

<P>
   PERRY, Iowa _ Over the years, the Iowa caucuses have made some
presidential candidates (like Jimmy Carter in 1976) and unmade
others (like Steve Forbes in 1996). But this time, they have seemed
like a warm-up bout compared with the ballyhooed main event in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   That may be changing. With only 10 days left until Jan. 24, when
tens of thousands of Iowans will assemble in living rooms, clubs
and school halls to declare their preferences, two well-funded,
well-organized underdogs _ Forbes and Bill Bradley _ have
accelerated their efforts. If not to defeat their respective
rivals, Al Gore and George W. Bush, they hope to come close enough
to get a lift as they move to New Hampshire, whose critical primary
takes place only eight days later on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Their task is difficult, not only because many potential caucus
participants, in small towns like Perry as well as cities like Des
Moines, find no great differences among the various candidates on
major issues, but also because most Iowans have shared in the
national prosperity of recent years. Insurgents struggle when times
are good, and Iowa has staged its big upsets in years when jobs
were scarce or the parties were split on ideological lines.
</P>
<P>
   But Iowans often make up their minds at the last minute, and
polls suggest that they have not made their final caucus decisions
yet.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   ``Politics is Muzak to a lot of people,'' said David Yepsen, the
chief political reporter for the Des Moines Register. ``They don't
pay attention until they have to, and that's getting later and
later. In the governor's race last year, Tom Vilsack came from 25
points behind in the last three weeks to win by five points.''
</P>
<P>
   In this year's Democratic contest, Bradley, a former senator
from New Jersey, has decided to devote all or part of every day
until the caucuses to campaigning in Iowa. A certain languor still
marks his personal style, and he still tries to cast himself as a
different kind of politician, who accentuates the positive. One day
this week, he bent his 6-foot, 5-inch frame around a lectern and
chatted for half an hour with schoolchildren about health.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley's words in other contexts have taken on an edge,
whether he is accusing Gore of neglecting the interests of Iowa
farmers, many of whom have been left behind in the Clinton-era
boom, or attacking him as a reliable friend of the big tobacco
companies.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The latest Iowa poll, taken by the Des Moines Register and
published last Saturday, showed Gore 21 percentage points ahead of
Bradley, about the same margin found in a survey taken last
November. But many of the state's most experienced politicians
think the contest is a good deal closer than that.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 percent of the delegates elected this month will
probably be undecided. If the remaining 90 percent are split 60-30
between Gore and Bradley, in that order, the former senator will be
severely hurt. But if Bradley could get 40 percent or better, said
Democratic state chairman Rob Tully, ``that would send him off to
New Hampshire with some momentum, and he'd be able to say that half
the Iowa Democrats had rejected a sitting vice president of their
own party.''
</P>
<P>
   The popular Gov. Thomas Vilsack, a Democrat who has taken no
stance in the Bradley-Gore fight, said that younger voters, many of
whom have never before taken part in the caucuses, are drawn to
Bradley. Across the state, he added, Gore supporters, including the
governor's own wife, Christie, are feeling the heat.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Gore is going to stop at our house in Mt. Pleasant for an
event my wife is hosting next week,'' Vilsack said. ``The fact that
Tipper feels that she has to do that, when Christie is already out
there working for the vice president, shows the kind of deep
inroads Bradley is making.''
</P>
<P>
   So does Vilsack expect an upset? ``Not if you define an upset as
winning,'' he replied. ``I don't think so. The party leadership and
the traditional caucus-goers are too committed to the vice
president. They'll turn out no matter what _ snow or rain, no
matter what the weather is.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As always, the weather will count. Only the most committed
venture out on frosty midwinter nigh even fewer if it snows
or sleets. The effect is much more substantial than it might be in
a primary, when voters cast their ballots in daylight hours,
usually much closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Gifford, a longtime labor activist in Iowa who is closely
identified with Democratic politics, is backing Gore this year. But
he worries about elderly voters, many of them Gore supporters, in a
state with the nation's third oldest electorate, average age 51.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore needs the seniors to turn up on caucus night,'' Gifford
said. ``If there's an ice storm and they don't come out, and
Bradley's youngsters do, you could get a swing of 15 to 20 percent,
which is a whole lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who is saturating television with an estimated $800,000
in commercials, has moved a cadre of young organizers into Iowa,
many of them trained at Participation 2000, a campaign school at
which Bradley has lectured. But Gore is not likely to be
out-organized, not with the United Auto Workers and the National
Education Association in his corner.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley has a solid enough organization to guarantee a
good turnout in places like Dubuque and Cedar Rapids, say
Democratic pros, Gore has capable teams in place almost everywhere.
And Gore volunteers in a Waterloo boiler room made more than 30,000
telephone calls statewide just in the last week.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Iowans will respond is a matter of disagreement.
Politicians say that barring really foul weather, they expect the
usual turnout, about 100,000 in each party. But Professor Hugh
Winebrenner of Drake University, a caucus historian, said he
expected a smaller participation, perhaps 80,000 for the Democrats
and 85,000 for the Republicans, largely because ``neither a
candidate or an issue has caught fire.'' Not that the candidates
have not tried; Republican candidates, by his count, have spent a
total of 558 days in Iowa since January 1997, and Democratic
candidates have spent 149.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican figure is a record, Winebrenner said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Travel around the state, and voter enthusiasm seems muted, to
say the least. Here in Perry, a trim little town of 7,300, set amid
the deep black soil of rich farmlands, only 3 of 12 people
interviewed at random said they planned to attend the caucuses this
year, and only one piece of political advertising was evident _ a
big ``George W. Bush'' placard at a crossroads south of town.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Hotel Pattee, a magnificently restored Arts and
Crafts gem, one farmer said, ``I've pretty much lost faith in
politics.'' Another said, ``I'll go, I guess, because I always
have, since I was 21, but I don't think it'll change much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the candidates think they're important,'' said Colette
Wortman, 62, a payroll supervisor at a Des Moines insurance company
who does not plan to attend a caucus. ``They are here to get a
vote, and they don't care about you after you vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Camille Wanna, 31, a stockbroker, said he detected ``a lot of
apathy,'' largely because most people think the outcome ``is going
to be a slam dunk for Bush and Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting at Coe College on Wednesday, Craig Wood, a student,
told Gore, ``I'm concerned about your ability to win.'' But few
potential participants said their preferences would be affected by
national polls showing Bradley with a better chance than Gore to
defeat the Republican nominee. Stan Gore, 44, a systems analyst
with the Principal Financial Group, said he planned to vote for
Gore at a caucus, even though he thought the vice president might
well lose to Bush in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On the face of things, Bush seems to have little to fear from
Forbes in Iowa, and his main rival in New Hampshire, Sen. John
McCain of Arizona, is skipping Iowa _a tactic that has often
backfired in the past. Forbes trails badly in all the polls. Kayne
Robinson, the Republican state chairman, said that ``if someone is
going to make a run at Bush, the time is now, starting with the
next television debate on Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   After a monthlong absence, Forbes returned to the state Tuesday,
and he started an extensive bus tour Thursday. Announcing that
``we're here for the next two weeks,'' he launched a new television
onslaught with a graphic commercial focusing on abortion. It
includes an ultrasound image of a fetus and a woman saying, ``If
someone kills a pet, it's called a crime. If someone aborts a
child, it's called a choice.'' Forbes is relying heavily on
television; he outspent Bush last year by 3-to-2.
</P>
<P>
   But neither he nor the other Republican candidates _ Sen. Orrin
Hatch of Utah, Alan Keyes and Gary Bauer _ has been able to deny
Bush the support of some of the leaders of the state's powerful
anti-abortion forces. Ione Dilley and Paul Carbone, two influential
figures, have sided with Bush, although others have thrown their
support elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the candidates are more or less acceptable to
mainstream Republicans here,'' Robinson said. ``There's no clear
differentiation of philosophy, less than ever before. So people ask
themselves, `Which Republican is most likely to stand up there next
January and take the oath of office?' Most think George Bush is the
answer to that question.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' not-so-secret weapon is his organization, which
Winebrenner called ``one of the best I've ever seen.'' His aides
are also playing the expectations game, suggesting that Bush needs
to get at least half the vote to be considered a winner _ no easy
target, of course, with so many candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But Iowa results can take odd bounces. In 1984, former Vice
President Walter Mondale took half the vote, but headlines went to
Gary Hart, whose 16 percent was described as a significant
``victory'' for him.
</P>
<P>
   In 2000, a strong Forbes showing in Iowa might not help him so
much in New Hampshire, but softening up Bush might ultimately
benefit McCain.

BOY WHO KILLED GETS 7 YEARS AS JUDGE CRITICIZES LAW 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PONTIAC, Mich. _ A state judge here ruled Thursday that the
youngest American ever charged and convicted as an adult of murder
will serve a seven-year sentence at a maximum-security juvenile
detention center and then be released. The unexpectedly lenient
sentence stunned prosecutors and disappointed lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland County Circuit Court Judge Eugene Arthur Moore rejected
prosecutors' request that Nathaniel Abraham, 13, who was convicted
of a murder committed when he was 11, be sentenced to serve
additional time in an adult prison unless he has clearly been
rehabilitated by the age of 21. Moore also read from the bench a
ringing denunciation of the national trend over the last decade
toward trying and sentencing younger and younger children as
adults, saying that society has leaned too far toward punishment
instead of rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Moore called for changes in the 3-year-old law that makes it
possible for children of any age to be tried as adults in Michigan.
He called the law ``fundamentally flawed'' and suggested that the
state return to its practice before 1997 of reserving such trials
and sentences for children who are at least 14 when they commit
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Legislature has responded to juvenile criminal activity
not by helping to prevent and rehabilitate, but rather by treating
juveniles more like adults,'' Moore said in his sentencing opinion.
``The real solution is to prevent an adult criminal population ever
coming into existence.''
</P>
<P>
   State lawmakers across the country have been rewriting juvenile
justice codes in response to some constituents' demands that they
get tough on young offenders accused of terrible crimes. But
critics contend, and Moore agreed Thursday, that the juvenile
justice system has far more success at rehabilitation than the
adult correctional system.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan House Speaker Charles Perricone, a Republican who
helped write the state's strict juvenile justice law, said changes
in the law were unlikely as long as Republicans controlled the
state's House, Senate and the governor's mansion. ``At the end of
the day, someone, and I had hoped it would be the judge, should
stand up and ask one simple question: does this individual present
a danger to society?'' Perricone said in a telephone interview.
``We don't need judges on a soap box. We need judges who will
uphold the law.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John Engler opposes revising the law, particularly because
the state's prosecutors and judges endorsed it in 1996, said Susan
Shafer, a spokeswoman for the governor.
</P>
<P>
   By coincidence, Moore was the president of the Michigan Probate
Judges Association when the law was adopted, and the association
endorsed the law then. Lisa Halushka, the family division chief in
the Oakland County prosecutor's office who was the lead prosecutor
in Nathaniel's case, said that because of this history, she was
especially stunned and disappointed by Thursday's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has left me speechless,'' she said. ``As soon as I got the
impression he would go straight juvenile, I thought: Michigan
Probate Judges Association.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel faces a pretrial hearing next week on a separate
charge of breaking into a garage shortly before the slaying. But he
had never been convicted of a crime before he went out on a
hillside on the evening of Oct. 19, 1997, and used a borrowed,
.22-caliber rifle with its gunstock missing to shoot Greene, a
stranger, once in the back of the head at a range of more than 200
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Fieger, Nathaniel's lead lawyer, said that if Nathaniel
was guilty of anything, it was reckless use of a firearm. But
prosecutors presented evidence that Nathaniel had prepared for the
slaying by shooting at balloons, and had later boasted about the
killing to friends at his elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   Moore has declined all interviews during the trial, and did so
again Thursday. He has handled Nathaniel's case from the beginning,
and granted prosecutors permission to try Nathaniel as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   Under Michigan law, Moore had three sentencing options. He could
have sentenced Nathaniel to eight to 25 years in adult prison; time
in a juvenile detention center followed by a second sentencing
hearing between his 18th and 21st birthdays to decide on additional
time in an adult prison if he had not been fully rehabilitated; and
time only in a juvenile detention center. Prosecutors, who have
received some criticism here for harshness, recommended the second
option.
</P>
<P>
   At least 44 states have adopted new juvenile justice laws since
1992 that allow more children to be tried as adults.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In one nationally publicized case, Kip Kinkel was sentenced in
November in Portland, Ore., to more than 111 years in prison
without possibility of parole for having fatally shot his parents
and two fellow high school students when he was 15 years old.
</P>
<P>
   There has been only one other case in Oakland County of
prosecutors' recommending a combination of juvenile and adult
crime. Moore also presided in that recent case, which involved a
home invasion by another offender who committed the crime at the
age of 16, Mrs. Halushka said. The offender, who was white,
received a six-month sentence in a county jail after he reached the
age of 18 in a juvenile detention center without showing that he
had been rehabilitated, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fieger welcomed Moore's decision, but said he would proceed with
his plan to appeal the jury's verdict last November. Nathaniel, who
wore a brown and gray shirt with khaki trousers, was expressionless
during the sentencing, but another of his lawyers, Daniel Bagdade,
said he had his hand on Nathaniel's shoulder and could feel his
client trembling.
</P>
<P>
   After the trial, Bagdade said, ``Nate looked up at me and the
first words out of his mouth were, `What happened?''' Nathaniel
will turn 14 next week, but psychologists testified at his trial
that he was mentally and emotionally impaired.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of the slain man, Ronnie Greene Jr., who was 18, had
varying reactions to the verdict. His grandmother, Joanne Hayden,
reacted calmly when the sentence was read but a minute later leaned
against a wall outside the courtroom and began weeping while loudly
crying, ``Oh, Ronnie, Oh, Ronnie, Oh, my boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Hayden, the dead man's uncle, said he believed Nathaniel
should have received a combination of a juvenile and adult
sentence. Hayden also said that Michigan's law on young offenders
should remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel is black, as was Greene, and the case here has drawn
national attention from civil rights activists. Fieger and these
activists have contended that Nathaniel would have been treated
differently in this mostly white county if he were also white _ a
contention that Mrs. Halushka rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred protesters showed up for the hearing, with many
of them standing in wind-driven snow outside the courtroom, beating
drums and chanting slogans like ``Nathaniel, we love you.'' One of
the protest's leaders, the Rev. Al Sharpton of New York, said after
the sentencing that while he was pleased that Nathaniel would not
be sent to prison, he still believed that Nathaniel should have
been acquitted and that Michigan's juvenile justice laws should be
rewritten.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge said some strong and courageous things _ he
convicted the system but he incarcerated Nathaniel,'' Sharpton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, 64, has a national reputation as an experienced and
respected juvenile court judge. He was first elected as a juvenile
court judge in a countywide race in 1966, and has won every
reelection campaign since then, usually running unopposed; his
current, six-year term will not expire until the end of 2004. Moore
succeeded his father, Judge Arthur Eugene Moore, on the juvenile
court bench, and his father's portrait still hangs in the county
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Moore ``leans toward more lenient sentences,'' Mrs. Halushka
said. But in this heavily Republican county on the northern edge of
Detroit, the judge makes occasional appearances at Republican
fund-raisers, she said, while adding that elections for judges are
non-partisan and Moore ``is not super-political.''

<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a discovery that could help explain the origin of
the earliest galaxies, a new astronomy satellite has detected the
first discrete objects in the mysterious glow of X-rays that
pervades the distant universe.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the faintest of the radiation sources, astronomers said,
could be the most distant objects ever observed. They promise to be
important clues to conditions in the cosmic dark age, the period
that began soon after the Big Bang created the universe and lasted
until the emergence of a multitude of stars that gave light to the
firmament, perhaps a billion years.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the X-rays appear to be emanating from the cores of
galaxies. These cores, being seen now as they existed in the early
universe, were probably supermassive black holes sucking in gas at
nearly the speed of light and generating tremendous radiation. Yet
in many cases the objects do not emit visible light, suggesting
that they existed at a time before the multitude of stars.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery, reported here Thursday at a meeting of the
American Astronomical Society, was hailed by scientists as the
first major step in solving the mystery of the pervasive X-rays
that form a backdrop throughout the universe. Until the launching
of NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory five months ago, the mystery
had defied explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all very excited by this finding,'' said Richard
Mushotzky of the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., who
was the leader of the discovery team. ``These are signposts of the
first things formed in the universe.''
</P>
<P>
   Other astronomers called it ``a major discovery'' and said the
data appeared to be impressive, although they wanted to see more
observations by the Chandra spacecraft and the orbiting Hubble
Space Telescope, as well as by ground-based telescopes, to
understand the phenomenon fully.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are probing further and further into the past of galaxy
formation and how that happened,'' said Virginia Trimble, an
astronomer at the University of California at Irvine, who was not a
member of the discovery team.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing the implications of the findings at a news
conference, Ms. Trimble said the objects showed for the first time
what is creating the X-ray background in space and also revealed
that this background radiation is not perfectly smooth but instead
marked by subtle fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
   That could give astronomers an opening for new investigations
into one of the most fundamental unanswered questions in cosmology:
How did matter created in the aftermath of the Big Bang, once all
but uniformly smooth, get to be as lumpy as it is now in a universe
of large-scale structures like galaxies and spreading clusters of
galaxies?
</P>
<P>
   Learning more about the X-ray objects, Ms. Trimble said, should
give astronomers important insights into the transition, which must
have occurred during the cosmic dark age, all but unobservable
until now. The only earlier phenomenon previously observed was
microwave background radiation, a relic of the Big Bang itself,
which bears only the faintest traces of incipient galactic
structure. After the dark age, which may have lasted a billion
years or so, came the appearance of star-studded galaxies.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings, however, along with other research reported at
the astronomy meeting, suggest that relatively starless galaxies
may have been emerging everywhere during the dark age.
</P>
<P>
   In this interpretation, masses of gas and also dark matter, the
exotic particles created by the Big Bang that are thought to be a
major cosmic constituent, plumped together into proto-galaxies. At
the cores of at least some, the masses were so great that they
formed black holes, those awesome gravitational sinks so dense
that, by the rules of Einstein's general theory of relativity,
nothing, not even light, can escape them. As ravenous black holes
consumed more gas, they produced the X-rays now being observed and
marking the locations of those galactic cores.
</P>
<P>
   If this interpretation is correct, then the X-ray observations
suggest that galaxy formation and black holes preceded the period
of star formation, a possibility raised by theorists in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   An article describing the X-ray discovery is to be published
soon in the journal Nature by Mushotzky of Goddard and his
collaborators: Lennox Cowie and Amy Barger of the University of
Hawaii and Keith Arnaud of the University of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The Chandra observatory, a 12,000-pound spacecraft in Earth
orbit, was designed to examine X-ray sources much fainter and more
distant than before. The newly described X-ray background was
observed for almost 28 hours last month through use of the
spacecraft's imaging spectrometer. The instrument was built for the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration by the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and Pennsylvania State University.
</P>
<P>
   Mushotzky's team looked at a small sector of the sky, a circle
about one-fifth the size of a full moon. The researchers were able
to resolve about 80 percent of the X-ray glow in that region into
specific light sources. Extrapolated across the entire sky, this
would add up to about 70 million sources, most of which are
galaxies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In their report, the astronomers said that one-third of the
detected sources were presumably proto-galaxies: their cores bright
in X-rays, yet no visible light from them has been picked up by the
Keck Observatory in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Another type of these sources appeared to be extremely faint.
They emitted little or no visible light either because they were
obscured by dust or they were so far away that the light was
absorbed by intervening matter on its long journey across space.
</P>
<P>
   In the latter case, Mushotzky said, it may mean that the X-ray
objects are as much as 14 billion light-years away and thus the
earliest, most distant objects ever observed.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the ultimate interpretation of the discovery, Mushotzky
said, ``We're changing the demographics of black holes _ their
masses, distribution, how much matter they are eating.''

FUGITIVE MEXICAN SINGER SOUGHT IN SEX CASE IS ARRESTED IN BRAZIL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The last time that the pop star known as Gloria
Trevi performed on television in Mexico, she pranced and tossed her
mane of wavy hair with the carefree defiance that made her an icon
of rebellion among young girls.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday the artist was back on television again. Looking
subdued and wearing a gray T-shirt in place of her old sequined
halter top, Ms. Trevi was caught by cameras in Rio de Janiero,
Brazil, where she was arrested on charges of corrupting minors.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Trevi's longtime manager, Andrade Sanchez, was also
arrested, along with another singer in the case, Maria Raquel
Portillo. Andrade is accused of forcing sex upon several young
girls who were among his teen-age proteges.
</P>
<P>
   He and Ms. Trevi dropped from view over a year ago, but they
have been fugitives from justice since arrest warrants were issued
against them in Mexico last November.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico immediately initiated extradition proceedings Thursday.
In statements to the police in Brazil, both Ms. Trevi and Andrade
denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal has burned hot in Mexico for many months, exposing
the underside of an insular entertainment world filled with
freewheeling sex where Andrade had gained the mesmerizing power of
a cult leader with young girls who hoped for stardom.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Trevi became one of Mexico's flashiest stars in the
early '90s because of her image of independence, a number of girls
who said they were lured into Andrade's harem have contended that
the singer was utterly dominated by him and helped him to commit
sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Andrade and Ms. Trevi, whose real name is
Gloria de los Angeles Trevino, were first brought by the parents of
Karina Yapor Gomez, a young girl who was sent by her family when
she was 12 years old to study piano at a school run by Andrade.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, when she was 15, Karina Yapor, who by then was living
in Spain with Andrade, Ms. Trevi and a half-dozen other young
girls, gave birth to a baby boy. Miss Yapor abandoned the emaciated
infant in a Spanish hospital, and her parents finally took him into
their care in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In their criminal complaint, Miss Yapor's parents contended that
Andrade kidnapped their daughter and fathered her baby by force.
</P>
<P>
   Last December 16, Miss Yapor, who had not been home in two
years, suddenly turned up at the studios here of Televisa, the
national network where Ms. Trevi had been a star. In interviews so
wooden that she seemed to be speaking from a memorized text, Miss
Yapor called on her parents to drop the charges against Ms. Trevi
and Andrade.
</P>
<P>
   She offered her celebrity associates a ``very big apology,
because they were always very nice to me,'' and denied that the
rock manager was the father of her child.
</P>
<P>
   But Miss Yapor then returned to her parents' home in northern
Chihuahua state and went silent, and her family did not drop the
charges. At least four other young women have testified to police
since Miss Yapor's case became public that Andrade hit them and
forced them to have sex with him as a condition for continuing with
his music training.
</P>
<P>
   ``God always brings justice, both in heaven and on earth,''
Miguel Yapor, Karina's father, said in a telephone interview
Thursday. But he said it was not clear whether his daughter would
testify against Andrade in the upcoming trial.

SOUNDING LIKE A FATHER, GEORGE BUSH GIVES HIS SON A PUSH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, N.H.)  (dal) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC, Iowa _ Gov. George W. Bush put out a call for Dad on
Thursday. And Dad, the former president, came running, telling Iowa
voters that they should vote for his son in the Jan. 24 Republican
presidential caucuses because he was tough enough and experienced
enough to occupy the White House and would ``serve with honor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd be excellent at doing what I tried to do,'' President
Bush said, sounding more like a father than a political promoter.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Bush's appearance here in the packed high school
auditorium of this southwest Iowa farm town was his first genuine
stump performance for his son, though previously he had appeared a
some fund-raisers, many closed to the public. But it was not an
appearance suddenly scheduled because George W. is in any serious
political trouble in Iowa, scene of the nation's first caucuses. He
is not.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it was an appearance that seemed intended to boost the
governor's lead in Iowa over his nearest caucus contender, the
publisher Steve Forbes. The better he does in Iowa, his campaign
hopes, the bigger will be his ``bounce'' as he heads for New
Hampshire, where the nation's first primary will be held on Feb. 1
and where several polls show him trailing Sen. John McCain of
Arizona. McCain is not participating in the Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope people who are undecided will take at look at my son,''
the elder Bush said in 30 minutes of off-the-cuff remarks in which
he mixed self-deprecatory humor about his own campaign triumphs and
travails with dead-serious pleas for support for his son.
</P>
<P>
   Polls indicate that at least 10 percent of all likely Republican
voters have not yet made up their minds about whom to vote for. Of
those who say they favor Bush, about half also say they might be
persuaded to vote for someone else.
</P>
<P>
   But about three-fourths of those who say they are inclined to
vote for Forbes say they might be persuaded to vote for someone
else.
</P>
<P>
   President Bush had mixed results himself back in the days when
he was competing for votes in Iowa, placing first in the 1980
caucuses but later getting ``dusted'' in New Hampshire, as he put
it Thursday. Eight years later, he stumbled and finished third in
Iowa, yet managed to recover in other contests and went on to win
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   So how much his appearance here this afternoon, along with a
second stop in Des Moines, helped his son is but a guess. But a
number of national polls have indicated that George W.'s high poll
numbers can be accounted for, in part, by the fact that he carries
the Bush name. In any event, Bush campaign officials say the former
president's trip to Iowa to stump would be followed by other visits
to other states.
</P>
<P>
   Further, they said that the governor's mother, Barbara, who has
been out on the stump for some time, would continue her travels.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's working her heart out for our son,'' the former
president told his audience of 600 or so school children,
townspeople and local farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again he made the point in his 30-minute talk that
during much of his time as vice president and president, his son
had been at his side, helping and observing. In the years since, he
went on, he has served as governor of a state that has an economy
larger than that of most countries and where ``they don't play
softball in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows this stuff,'' the elder Bush said, in a seeming
effort to allay any fears that his son might not have enough
experience to serve as president. ``He knows what the stakes are,''
he went on.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was at my side during a lot. I think he would be excellent
at it. He will serve with honor.''
</P>
<P>
   The former president said at the start of his remarks _ ``These
are remarks, because I don't give speeches anymore,'' he insisted _
that he would have ``nothing bad to say against any of the people
that George is campaigning against right now.'' Nor, he added,
would he offer any ``sour grapes'' or ``bad loser'' comments about
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, he stuck by his word, though toward the end
he made some oblique remarks that came close to touching on the
Lewinsky scandal, saying at one point as he called for new national
leadership:
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's what I want: I want to see us return to a society with
fundamental values.'' Then, edging in a little closer, he joked
that the Jenny Craig diet company had recently called to ask him
whether he was interested in trying to lose 30 pounds _ an obvious
reference to Monica Lewinsky, who has signed on as a company
representative.
</P>
<P>
   He closed on a family values note, saying that his parents had
taught him to ``be kind, be honest and give somebody else the
credit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lot from them about fundamental values,'' he
added, ``and I would hope my son has.''

SUCCESS OF MISSILE INTERCEPTOR TEST IS QUESTIONED

<TEXT>
<P>
   A critical test of an interceptor designed to destroy ballistic
warheads, hailed as a success when it took place last Oct. 2, may
not have been such a clear-cut demonstration that antimissile
technology is feasible, critics of the effort say.
</P>
<P>
   The interceptor, a 120-pound ``kill vehicle'' launched on a
rocket and maneuvered with thrusters, is meant to home in on and
destroy missiles carrying nuclear or biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In the test, the interceptor did hit a mock warhead _ proof,
according to its backers in the Defense Department, that the idea
is workable. But in recent interviews, Pentagon officials conceded
that the interceptor hit its target only after a series of
technical mistakes caused it to drift off course, and that it
initially picked up on a decoy balloon rather than the warhead.
Critics of antimissile systems say these mistakes show that any
such system could easily be fooled.
</P>
<P>
   The decoy was meant to represent the sort of measures that
hostile countries might employ to confuse a national missile
defense. But without the large, bright balloon, which in this case
happened to be drifting near the smaller and dimmer warhead in the
interceptor's field of view, the test last October may not have
succeeded, these critics say.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this says to me is, if that balloon hadn't been there,
then they wouldn't have hit the target,'' said Tom Z. Collina,
director of the Arms Control and International Security Program at
the Union of Concerned Scientists. ``They got lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization at the
Pentagon acknowledged the problems when contacted by a reporter.
But the officials offered an entirely different interpretation of
the sequence of events during the test, maintaining that the
successful interception proved that the system as a whole would
work properly even under adverse circumstances, when not all of its
components were working properly.
</P>
<P>
   If there had not been a balloon, said Keith Englander, director
of system engineering for the Pentagon's missile defense
organization, the interceptor ``would have continued to look in the
space where it had been told to go look for the MRV,'' or medium
re-entry vehicle, the military term for the simulated warhead that
was used.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then the MRV would have appeared,'' Englander said.
</P>
<P>
   But even within the Pentagon, debate has arisen about how to
interpret the results, according to congressional staff members who
have been briefed by Pentagon officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not clear yet whether having the decoy there made the
intercept happen or not,'' said a congressional staff member who
has been briefed by analysts both inside and outside the missile
defense organization at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   The new information is likely to raise the stakes for the next
test of the system, scheduled for next week. The Pentagon is
supposed to decide by this summer whether the system is ready for
deployment and present its conclusions to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But the previously unannounced details about the test renewed
old questions about the hit-to-kill missile defense program.
Congressional investigators found, years after the fact, that tests
of hit-to-kill systems in 1984 and 1991 had been partly rigged to
make the systems appear more effective than they actually were.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the errors in the last test had not been made public
before, Lt. Col. Rick Lehner, a spokesman for the Ballistic Missile
Defense Organization, said he had not been told about them until he
received a press query.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know about it at all, so obviously it wasn't of much
concern at the program office,'' Lehner said. ``It wasn't like they
said, `Oh, my God, we had a malfunction.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the Oct. 2 test, the mock warhead and decoy were launched
from Vandenburg Air Force Base in California and the interceptor
from Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. The interception took
place 140 miles above the central Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   But while the test was declared an unqualified success, the kill
vehicle, built under contract by Raytheon, had to overcome two
technical problems to make the interception, Englander said.
</P>
<P>
   First, because an incorrect star map had been loaded into the
vehicle's computer, it could not navigate using the stars once it
had separated from its booster rocket and began using thrusters to
maneuver. Instead, the kill vehicle relied on an on-board, inertial
guidance system, and ``there was some drift error in that,''
Englander said.
</P>
<P>
   That error led to inaccuracies in pointing the heat-seeking, or
infrared, sensors that the vehicle used to locate targets. But even
with the inaccuracies, the vehicle sensed the mylar balloon in the
corner of its field of view. Then, using the balloon as a reference
point, the vehicle continued searching for the smaller and cooler
warhead and eventually found it nearby, in time to home in on it
and destroy it.
</P>
<P>
   The errors ``had no impact on the end result,'' said Lehner, who
called them ``basically meaningless.''
</P>
<P>
   Englander said the problems had been fixed in preparation for
next week's test.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing they established in this test is that if they
can see the warhead that they can home with enough precision to hit
it,'' said Theodore Postol, a professor of science, technology and
national security policy at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Postol called that ``a useful demonstration'' but added that it
``has very little to do with a real-world defense.''
</P>
<P>
   In an actual attack, he said, the possible number of decoys
scattered throughout space is unlimited, and the warheads could be
much more difficult to see.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Young, deputy director of the Coalition to Reduce
Nuclear Dangers, an organization that has opposed a quick decision
on the usefulness of a national missile defense, said, ``They can,
as they demonstrated, hit a bullet with a bullet, but the fact is
that doing that reliably is incredibly complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Young added, ``There's no point in trying to deploy something
when the technology is still being developed.''

 &HT;    Driven Harvard dropout became icon of an industry
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bill Gates, a onetime computer nerd, was the only
chief executive Microsoft had until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   To the world, he was a symbol of American technology. To his
executives, he was a hard-driving boss who preferred high-level
technical discussions to easy banter. Although he began Microsoft
on a shoestring, his is not a rags-to-riches story.
</P>
<P>
   Instead he was the prototype of the new digital generation. He
was born Oct. 28, 1955, to a prominent Seattle family. His father,
William Henry Gates Jr., was a partner in a Seattle law firm and
his mother, Mary, was a regent at the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was 13 years old, Gates was programming in the
Basic computer language. The gangly and awkward child had turned
pro by 17, selling his first program for $4,200.
</P>
<P>
   He spent a couple of years at Harvard University, but he was an
unexceptional student, preferring all-night poker games and messing
with computers to classes.
</P>
<P>
   When the first affordable small computer came out _ a machine
called the Altair that sold in kit form for $400 _ Gates lost all
interest in school. He had found his true love.
</P>
<P>
   He and Paul Allen _ whom Gates met while a student at Seattle's
exclusive Lakeside preparatory school _ moved to Albuquerque, N.M.,
establishing Microsoft in 1975. While Gates was a too-young,
unlikely looking executive, his competitors soon learned that there
was a deep competitive spirit and even a ruthlessness that could
not be hidden by his squeaky voice, glasses and mop of hair.
</P>
<P>
   The future of Microsoft was assured when Gates bought the rights
to a computer operating system, improved it and then sold it to
International Business Machines Corp. for use with IBM's
then-revolutionary Personal Computer. The name Personal Computer
created the term ``PC,'' and Gates' Microsoft Disk Operating System
became known to almost every computer user as DOS.
</P>
<P>
   The company grew with the PC into the country's largest software
company. Gateshimself became as close as possible to an industry
superstar, eventually eclipsing even Steve Jobs, co-founder of
Apple Computer, as the man most identified with America's dominance
in the digital world.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft made Gates the wealthiest individual in the world,
with a fortune estimated at $85 billion. It also made him into a
man who was a stand-up comedian while serving as a keynote speaker
at industry events but who, in private, guarded his privacy. Within
the industry, he was seen as ruthless with his competitors and his
own executives, pushing his company and its products to dominate
over 90 percent of the personal computing operating system market.
</P>
<P>
   But even his enemies credit Gates and Microsoft as one of the
main reasons America is the acknowledged leader in the software
business. Monetary gain never tempered Gates' competitive drive.
</P>
<P>
   An article published in the December issue of Forbes said,
``Competitors once wistfully looked forward to the day when Gates
had children, in hopes that it would deflect his competitive
spirit. Well? With the arrival of his second child this past
summer, Gates says he's simply more focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates told his Forbes interviewer:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very lucky. I don't have to take time to mow the lawn. I
have this great job that I care a lot about, and my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates and Microsoft also have been active in philanthropy. He
told Forbes:
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the reason for believing that my wealth should be
given back to society _ (and) not, in any substantial percentage,
be passed on to my children _ is that I don't think it would be
good for them. You'd like to have a situation where they really
feel like they really need to get out and work and contribute to
society. I think that's an important element of a fulfilling
life.''

 &HT;    Longtime lieutenant receives his stars
 &HT;    By Susan Wells
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Other than the timing, nothing about Thursday's news
was a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   For the past several years, Steve Ballmer, 43, has been running
Microsoft day to day, going around the world selling the products
and trying to blunt some of the hard edges his boss, Bill Gates,
displayed during the antitrust trial in Washington and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer, the fourth richest man in the world with $28 billion by
The New York Times' reckoning, is a marketer by trade. The big,
affable guy with a shining bald head is a remarkably frank-speaking
executive who last fall rattled the markets by telling a crowd of
business editors that tech stocks, including his own, were largely
overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   He's obviously passionate when he talks about his company but
doesn't take himself so seriously that he can't laugh at some of
the odd positions he finds himself in while defending a company
everyone loves to hate.
</P>
<P>
   When asked by the Irish Times what he thought of a technology
world in which he could cause a 3 percent drop in the Nasdaq with
what he calls a ``throwaway'' comment, he said, ``I think it's a
world in which nobody listens or pays any attention to what I said.
... Obviously, no one agrees with it. Everything's much higher now
than at the time I made my comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer joined Microsoft in 1980 after being lured out of
Procter &AMP; Gamble by Gates, his Harvard classmate. He has been a
close friend of Gates since their student days.
</P>
<P>
   For years he has been the heir apparent to Gates, his golf and
singing partner and the man who calls himself and Ballmer
``interchangeable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ballmer would clearly be Bill's successor,'' John Doerr, a
leading Silicon Valley venture capitalist, told The Seattle Times.
``He's an original.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer, despite his easygoing demeanor, is known as an
in-your-face competitor who refuses to compromise on what he sees
as his company's mission``He's the kind of businessman most companies either wish they
had working for them or wish they didn't have to deal with,'' said
a Hewlett Packard executive.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer, the son of a Ford executive, grew up near Detroit. He
met Gates at Harvard where the two math wizards connected both
academically and socially. They sang duets at college functions and
have been known since to sing at industry events.
</P>
<P>

MONKEY BORN FROM EMBRYO IS DIVIDED BY SCIENTISTS

   Scientists in Oregon have divided an eight-cell monkey embryo
into quarters, creating identical quadruplet embryos. One of them
survived and resulted in the birth of a baby monkey.
</P>
<P>
   In their report, which is being published Friday in the journal
Science, Dr. Gerald P. Schatten of the Oregon Regional Primate
Research Center in Beaverton and his colleagues say this is the
first time that embryos of primates were deliberately subdivided,
resulting in the birth of a live offspring. The splitting of
embryos can occur naturally when an early embryo spontaneously
divides in half, producing identical twins, or thirds or quarters
early in development. Each piece can then develop as an independent
embryo.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two decades, scientists have mimicked this process
by dividing early embryos from other animals in the laboratory and
then implanting them in females, where they develop normally.
</P>
<P>
   The new study involved 107 rhesus monkey embryos that were
divided into anywhere from two to nine pieces to form 368 embryos.
In addition to the monkey that was born after an embryo had been
divided into four, the investigators say they also have four
pregnancies under way with embryos that had been split in half. Two
of those split embryos will be identical twins if they survive
until birth, which is expected in May.
</P>
<P>
   Schatten's group did not achieve nearly the success that was
accomplished with other animals.
</P>
<P>
   The first successful embryo splitting was in 1978, when Dr.
Steen Willadsen, an embryologist in Windermere, Fla., divided sheep
embryos in two. Sixty percent to 80 percent of the split embryos
survived, resulting in the birth of live lambs. When Willadsen
divided the embryos in quarters, half survived; when he divided
them in eighths, 5 percent to 10 percent went on to become lambs.
</P>
<P>
   Willadsen repeated the work, with the same success rate, in
cows, goats, horses and pigs.
</P>
<P>
   Schatten said that while the success rate with monkey embryos
had not been as great as with other species, the importance of his
work was that he had established that embryos could be divided. The
next step, he said, will be to create identical twin and quadruplet
monkeys to study the influence of genes on disease susceptibility.
He also wants to study the possibility of using embryos as a source
of cells that could be used for replacement parts in diseases like
diabetes or Parkinson's.
</P>
<P>
   ``AIDS, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, cancer, heart attacks and
strokes all could be moved to the cured list if we understood the
genetic basis of the disease,'' Schatten said.
</P>
<P>
   But some said the monkey results so far were a far cry from
cures for these diseases. There is the question, for example, of
why so few of the divided embryos survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either the primate embryos are not as suitable as sheep
embryos for artificially producing genetically identical
offspring,'' Willadsen said, ``or the techniques used were not
sufficiently good.''

<P>
   DENVER _ In the largest return of public land to American
Indians in the continental United States in more than 100 years,
the federal government is giving back 84,000 acres in northern Utah
that were taken from the Utes in 1916 for the rights to oil shale
reserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider this part of the Clinton-Gore environmental
legacy,'' Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said in an interview on
Thursday, reflecting the anticipated benefits of the arrangement
for President Clinton, as well as for Vice President Al Gore in his
quest for the presidency. ``We're trying to do the right thing,
returning land to its rightful owners.''
</P>
<P>
   The land transfer is part of a deal administration officials
have been negotiating with tribal leaders for almost seven years,
and a major component of the deal will help solve a long-standing
pollution problem in another part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, who plans to announce the deal on Friday at the
tribe's headquarters in Fort Duchesne, Utah, said the Utes would be
required to contribute a small percentage of any profits they
derived from oil and natural gas production to the cleanup of a
long-abandoned uranium site 80 miles south of their reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials say more than 10 tons of low-level
radioactive waste have sat for decades close to the Arches and
Canyonlands National Parks, leeching toxic material into the
Colorado River, which supplies drinking water to California and
other Western states. Cleanup is expected to cost as much as $300
million, and Congress is considering a bill that would pay for the
bulk of the work.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to show that the Energy Department can clean up
problems, rather than continue to create them,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   As a third component of the deal, the Utes have agreed to allow
a strip along 75 miles of the east bank of the Green River, which
borders their reservation, to be designated as wild and scenic, a
status that affords it protections it currently lacks.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other recent administration land initiatives, including
the designation this week of three new national monuments, the land
transfer has won support from many Western Republican lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Cannon, a Republican whose district includes
the land and adjacent reservation, said: ``This is the opposite of
the abusive things this administration has done. They recognized
common problems and dealt with them.''
</P>
<P>
   O. Roland McCook Sr., chairman of the tribe's governing body,
said he was delighted that land originally ceded to the Utes in
1882 was being returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tribe will once again be the true owner of its traditional
lands,'' McCook said, adding that the Utes ``can actively protect
and steward an area the membership's ancestors rightfully believed
would be a part of their descendants' heritage and homeland.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups in Utah were more measured in endorsing the
deal. While applauding any effort to clean up the uranium site,
officials from several organizations said they wanted to know more
details before congratulating the government for an act of apparent
generosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something can protect the land, clean up radioactive
tailings and address concerns the Utes have for their own
land-management needs, we're for it,'' said Lawson LeGate, senior
Southwest representative for the Sierra Club. ``But we must
withhold final judgment until we see all the details.''
</P>
<P>
   The land to be transferred adjoins 4.5 million acres of Uintah
and Ouray Reservation in northern Utah, where about 3,800 tribe
members live. It was set aside for the Utes, only to be taken back
by executive order when the Navy was securing oil reserves for
possible use as fuel in World War I or for a national emergency.
Over the years, nothing was ever extracted, and the land remained
unused and uninhabited, save for grazing horses, and managed by the
Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, with many naval vessels powered by nuclear
fuels, the need for reserve oil shale grew even less.
</P>
<P>
   The only larger parcels of land ever turned back to Native
Americans by the government involved tribes in Alaska, after it
became a state in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   For the Utes, an impoverished tribe, any economic benefits from
mining the land would, no doubt, help considerably. According to
government reports, the reservation has an unemployment rate of 29
percent and an average annual per capita income of $4,520. Much of
the tribe's revenues come from oil production elsewhere on the
reservation, a bowling alley, a water utility company and several
tribe-owned gas stations.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said the contract with the Utes calls for the tribe
to pay 8.5 percent of mineral royalties to the cleanup site, where
a mill operated from 1956 through 1984. The last owners left a pile
of waste that officials say is 110 feet high.
</P>
<P>
   To begin the cleanup, Congress has to authorize a change in
oversight to the Energy Department from the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, a transfer that is expected to proceed smoothly. Also,
federal lawmakers need to approve money to finance the project.
Richardson said the administration's budget request for fiscal year
2001 would include $10 million to begin the cleanup.

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: Minority gays now majority of AIDS cases
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The proportion of black and Hispanic gay men
developing AIDS each year is now greater than that of white gay
men. The development, forecast for years, arrived sooner than
expected, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Minorities made up 52 percent of all gay and bisexual men
diagnosed with AIDS in 1998, while white men accounted for 48
percent, the agency said. That was a sharp shift from 1989, when
minorities represented 31 percent of such cases of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``The face of AIDS among gay and bisexual men is changing,''
said Dr. Helene Gayle, director of the CDC's HIV branch.
``African-American and Hispanic men must recognize that this is not
a disease that only affects white gay men.''
</P>
<P>
   The fresh numbers, drawn from annual national reports of new
AIDS cases, add information to a trend recognized last year: Though
blacks make up only 13 percent of the U.S. population, they had
come to represent 49 percent of deaths from AIDS and 48 percent of
the new AIDS cases reported.
</P>
<P>
   That's a far cry from the early days of the AIDS epidemic, when
the disease was overwhelmingly identified with white men who had
sex with other men.
</P>
<P>
   CDC records show that by the end of 1998 (the most recent data),
708,738 cases of AIDS had been diagnosed in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Half of those cases were men who had sex with other men. More
than one in three of those cases were black men, and almost one in
five were Hispanic men.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS is now the leading cause of death among black men of any
sexual orientation between the ages of 25 and 44, and the
second-greatest cause of death for black women the same age.
</P>
<P>
   Communities of color have recently begun to mobilize around that
shift in statistics.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Surgeon General David Satcher called on
historically black medical schools to spread information about the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the first National Black Church HIV/AIDS Institute
brought representatives of black faith communities to Atlanta to
discuss outreach by churches, which have been criticized as being
slow to respond to the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Also in October, panels of the National AIDS Memorial Quilt
began a tour of historically black colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   That same month, Coretta Scott King, widow of the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr., condemned anti-gay bias within the black community
in a speech at Atlanta University Center. ``I have no doubt that
homophobia has worsened and prolonged the AIDS crisis,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the CDC said Thursday, the stigma still attached to
homosexuality in some communities of color may be contributing to
the rate of infection.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey of 8,780 men in 12 states, one of four black men who
had sex with other men, and one out of six such Latino men,
continued to describe themselves as heterosexual and to have sexual
relationships with women.
</P>
<P>
   Gayle said cultural pressure not to identify themselves as
homosexual reduces the chances such men will seek help and early
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   It also increases the likelihood they will continue to spread
the infection, to other men, female partners and their children as
well, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very real and sensitive issue requiring increased
dialogue and attention from leaders in communities of color,''
Gayle said. ``To truly win the battle against HIV, we must be
willing to acknowledge and wrestle with the difficult issues.''
</P>
<P>
   In a second study released Thursday, the CDC found black and
Hispanic gay and bisexual men are more likely than white gay and
bisexual men to become infected with HIV while they are young
adults.
</P>
<P>
   By analyzing data from 25 states that track new infections with
HIV as well as cases of full-blown AIDS, the agency found 16
percent of those who were 13- to 24-years-old when they were
infected were black, and 13 percent were Latino. Only 9 percent, in
contrast, were white.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men of color must be reached early with comprehensive HIV
prevention programs, especially in high-risk communities,'' said
Dr. Janet Blair, the study's author.

FDA FORCES DRUG MAKER TO KEEP THE FLU IN AD FOR A REMEDY
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Television viewers who have seen the advertisement
for Relenza, a new flu medication, know that it ends with a woman
who has taken the drug sitting in her kitchen while her husband
fixes chicken soup and the flu, personified by an actor, mills
about. What they may not notice is that the ending is a new one:
the Food and Drug Administration forced the drug's manufacturer,
Glaxo Wellcome, to pull an earlier version off the air.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the agency cited the company for false and
misleading advertising. The original advertisement, which ran
nationwide for a little more than a week, ended as the woman
ushered the flu, played by Wayne Knight, the actor who was the
irritating mailman on the ``Seinfeld'' television series, out the
door.
</P>
<P>
   The difference may seem slight, but agency officials said the
first commercial exaggerated the effectiveness of Relenza, which
does not cure the flu but rather cuts the duration of symptoms to a
little less than six days from seven.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that the ad as a whole, with the visual images and the
timing, exaggerated the effectiveness of this drug,'' said Tracy
Acker, an official in the division of drug marketing, advertising
and communications at the agency.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Ms. Acker said agency officials worried that
the original commercial might ``encourage people to use the drug
thinking it's this miracle cure when it has this very marginal
effectiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   While it is not unheard of, the action is highly unusual. Though
the agency sends about 200 letters a year to drug makers
questioning their advertising or promotion, only in a few cases,
Ms. Acker said, does it demand that television advertisements be
altered or removed.
</P>
<P>
   The action was expected to incite a debate over the advertising
of prescription drugs directly to patients, which some experts fear
may encourage patients to demand, and doctors to prescribe,
medicines that may not be appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Relenza and another new flu drug, Tamiflu by Hoffman-LaRoche,
have been heavily advertised, and on Wednesday, agency officials
issued a health advisory saying that doctors appeared to be relying
too much on the new drugs. The agency said some patients might have
died because they did not get other, more aggressive, treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the warning had been prompted, in part, by
concerns over heavy television advertising, but they did not say
they had already forced Glaxo Wellcome to pull an ad off the air.
On Tuesday, the agency had posted its violation notice to the
company on its Web site. The notice was dated Nov. 23.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-second advertisement is the centerpiece of Glaxo
Wellcome's national campaign for Relenza, said Julie Dean, a
spokeswoman for the company. She said the original commercial,
produced by the advertising agency Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi, began
appearing on Nov. 15 and was withdrawn as quickly as possible after
the FDA's Nov. 23 letter. The new version was first broadcast on
Dec. 4, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that what we put together in the first ad was a
reasonable representation of Relenza's activitthe FDA was
concerned and we addressed that concern,'' Ms. Dean said. ``We
worked with the FDA to make sure that we are sending responsible
and good messages to the consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than the ending, the ads are alike, Ms. Dean said. They
begin with Knight, personifying the flu, as he knocks at a woman's
door. He pushes his way inside and within moments, the woman has a
blanket around her shoulders and a thermometer in her mouth. He
muscles his way onto the couch, between her and her husband, and
takes up residence. He awakens her at 2:30 in the morning by
playing the bagpipes.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, she takes a dose of Relenza, an inhalant, and tries to
throw him out. There the versions diverge. In the original, she
succeeds; in the revision, he is still hanging around, laughing at
the thought that chicken soup could help the patient.
</P>
<P>
   About 300,000 prescriptions for Relenza have been written since
it came on the market last fall, and hundreds of thousands have
been written for Tamiflu. With the flu season in full swing, there
have been a number of news reports about the illness, although some
experts have wondered if the advertising about the new drugs, as
opposed to the flu outbreak itself, is driving the media attention.
</P>
<P>
   Such advertising has been proliferating since August 1997, when
the agency relaxed its restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Woosley, chairman of the pharmacology department at
Georgetown University, questions the benefit to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got serious concerns,'' he said. ``The advertising may
attempt to get information out to patients. That's very important,
and that's the goal. It wasn't the goal of advertising to let them
hype the drugs.''

   WASHINGTON _ Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman,
warned Thursday night that there were limits to how long the
economy could continue barreling along without igniting inflation,
and appeared to confirm the assumption on Wall Street that the
central bank will raise interest rates next month.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech at the New York Hilton that investors hoped would
provide some guidance about how aggressively the Fed would act to
tamp down inflationary pressures this year, Greenspan stressed that
not even the sweeping transformation wrought by technology has
freed the economy from the laws of supply and demand, and in his
veiled way he left little doubt that he is leaning toward tighter
monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he also emphasized that the process of reining in the
economy through higher interest rates is already ``well advanced,''
a phrase that will no doubt reduce fears in the markets that the
Fed is committed to a series of rate increases this year.
</P>
<P>
   In assessing current economic conditions, his focus, as it has
been for months, was on the possibility that the country could run
short of workers, pushing up wages and then prices in an
inflationary spiral that could derail the long expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by the stock market boom, demand for goods and services
is outstripping supply in the domestic economy, said Greenspan, who
was nominated earlier this month by President Clinton to a fourth
term as Fed chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is this imbalance between growth of supply and growth of
demand that contains the seeds of rising inflationary and financial
pressures that could undermine the current expansion,'' Greenspan
said in an address to the Economic Club of New York.
</P>
<P>
   So far there is little evidence that inflation is taking root. A
government report on Thursday, for example, showed that prices on
the producer level remained well contained. But another set of
statistics on Thursday showed that retail sales last month were
stronger than expected, further evidence that the economy roared
into the new year at a speed that most economists, especially those
at the Fed, think is unsustainable over the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Investors and many economists now assume the Fed will raise its
short-term federal funds target rate by at least a quarter of a
percentage point at its next policy meeting on Feb. 1 and 2. The
Fed raised the rate three times last year in quarter-point
increments, to 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The economy has responded to the strains on it so far, Greenspan
said, by importing more goods from abroad, luring workers from
other countries, and most of all by digging ever deeper into the
pool of available labor in the United States, where the
unemployment rate has been 4.1 percent for the last three months, a
30-year low.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line, however, is that while immigration and
imports can significantly cushion the consequences of the wealth
effect and its draining of the pool of unemployed workers for a
while, there are limits,'' Greenspan said. ``Admittedly, we are
groping to infer where those limits may be. But that there are
limits cannot be open to question.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan also used the speech to call for fiscal discipline on
the part of Congress and the Clinton administration as they prepare
to battle again over how to use the growing federal budget surplus.
And while acknowledging that globalization and technology have hurt
some workers, he defended free trade and unfettered competition as
powerful forces for improving standards of living.
</P>
<P>
   But much of his speech was a long rumination on the degree to
which technology-driven changes have fundamentally altered the
economy. The answer, he said, might be much clearer in another
decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may conceivably conclude from that vantage point that, at
the turn of the millennium, the American economy was experiencing a
once-in-a-century acceleration of innovation, which propelled
forward productivity, output, corporate profits and stock prices at
a pace not seen in generations, if ever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alternatively, that 2010 retrospective might well conclude
that a good deal of what we are currently experiencing was just one
of the many euphoric speculative bubbles that have dotted human
history,'' Greenspan said. ``And of course we cannot rule out that
we may look back and conclude that elements from both scenarios
have been in play in recent years.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while Greenspan clearly marveled in his address at the
power of technology to make business more efficient and the economy
more productive, he was careful to bring the discussion repeatedly
back to the issue of limits, a word he used repeatedly. He said the
Fed did not have the luxury of awaiting the outcome of the debate
over the new economy before deciding whether to act now to rein in
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   He repeated his longstanding skepticism of the value of the
traditional models that seek to predict how inflation will pick up
as unemployment falls in a fast-growing economy.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that ``there has to be a limit to how far the pool
of available labor can be drawn down'' before wage gains begin to
outstrip increases in productivity, or output per worker per hour.
Once wages start rising faster than productivity, companies face a
choice between raising prices, which would be inflationary, or
accepting narrower profit margins, which Greenspan said would be a
recipe for recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thus, if our objective of maximum sustainable growth is to be
achieved, the pool of available workers cannot shrink
indefinitely,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenspan said tighter financial conditions were already
trickling down through the economy. He noted that interest rates on
corporate debt had risen by a full percentage point since late
1997. The rise in rates, he said, was ``supported by a central bank
intent on defusing the imbalances that would undermine the
expansion.''  &QL;

WARNER-LAMBERT BEGINS MERGER TALKS WITH PFIZER

<TEXT>
<P>
   In an abrupt change of heart, executives at Warner-Lambert Co.
said Thursday they were negotiating a possible union with Pfizer
Inc., a suitor and rival they have battled for two months.
</P>
<P>
   That decision could leave Warner-Lambert's first choice as a
merger partner, American Home Products, alone at the altar for a
third time in two years. Either merger would create the world's
largest drug company.
</P>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert executives made their decision after the
company's shareholders increased their demands that the company
accept the far more lucrative offer from Pfizer. Pfizer's offer is
now worth about $75 billion, based on Thursday's closing stock
prices, while American Home's stands at about $50 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has always been the board's objective to secure the best
possible transaction for Warner-Lambert shareholders,'' Lodewijk
J.R. de Vink, chairman of Warner-Lambert, said in a statement,
``and we will now pursue discussions with Pfizer to determine if a
combination with them to achieve that goal is possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert shareholders had favored Pfizer's hostile bid
ever since it was made in early November, just hours after
Warner-Lambert and American Home said that they planned to merge.
But the shareholders have recently turned up the heat because of
worries about the thousands of lawsuits filed against American Home
by people who took the company's diet-pill combination called
fen-phen.
</P>
<P>
   American Home agreed in October to pay $3.75 billion to settle
claims from people who said their health suffered from the diet
treatment. But many people have refused to accept the settlement
and are instead continuing to pursue their claims separately.
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, a Mississippi jury awarded $150 million in
compensatory damages to five plaintiffs, four of whom said the
drugs had caused them to develop primary pulmonary hypertension, an
often fatal lung illness. The company then agreed to settle 1,400
cases brought in Mississippi for $350 million.
</P>
<P>
   The jury's decision caused American Home's stock price to slide
_ and the Pfizer bid to look even better to Warner-Lambert's
shareholders _ because it could mean that the cost of settling the
diet-drug lawsuits will be much greater than American Home
expected.
</P>
<P>
   American Home said Thursday it was not willing to simply go
away. ``We continue to support a strategic merger of equals of
Warner-Lambert and AHP under our existing merger agreement, the
terms of which remain under full force and effect,'' an American
Home spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Under that agreement, American Home stands to get as much as $2
billion in break-up fees if Warner-Lambert decides to merge with
Pfizer or another company. Some analysts said they were not sure
what the final outcome would be in what they called a bloody war
among the drug makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely not a certain deal because there is
significant animosity between Warner-Lambert and Pfizer,'' said
Neil Sweig, an analyst at Ryan, Beck &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Until Thursday, Warner-Lambert had bitterly fought Pfizer's bid,
filing several lawsuits and refusing even to talk to Pfizer
executives. For its part, Pfizer has tried in recent weeks to oust
members of the Warner-Lambert board and replace them with directors
supporting Pfizer's offer.
</P>
<P>
   If a merger takes place, Sweig and other analysts expect
significant layoffs at Warner-Lambert, which is based in Morris
Plains, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert has 43,000 employees, 3,000 of whom work in New
Jersey. Pfizer, based in New York, has 46,400 employees worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert is considered a prize in the pharmaceutical
industry because of Lipitor, its blockbuster cholesterol treatment,
and for other products it is developing. Warner-Lambert already has
a marketing agreement with Pfizer to sell Lipitor, a drug analysts
project could have worldwide sales of about $5 billion next year.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, both shareholders and analysts praised
Warner-Lambert's decision Thursday. The stock prices of all three
companies rose. Warner-Lambert rose $5.0625 a share, to $91.875.
Pfizer gained $1.875, to $37. And American Home rose 43.75 cents,
to $42.625.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that the announcement was bound to accelerate the
merger frenzy in the drug industry.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts speculated that American Home, based in
Madison, N.J., would quickly seek another partner or become a
takeover target of other drug makers. Analysts suggested that
SmithKline Beecham PLC might move to merge with American Home or
that American Home would try to take over Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, a
move that could break up the plans of Pharmacia and the Monsanto
Co. to combine. Pharmacia is led by Fred Hassan, a former American
Home executive.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, American Home failed in attempts to merge with
SmithKline and later with Monsanto because of conflicts about which
corporate executive would have control.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell B. Weiner, a spokesman at American Home, said that the
company would not comment on any merger speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a pipeline of rich products,'' Weiner said. ``We're in
good shape.''

 Barry Singer's most recent article for The New York Times was about
new musicals and how they get recorded.  
 By BARRY SINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Where singers are concerned, imitation is often the insincerest
form of flattery. Imitating the sound of someone else's voice is
never solely an act of homage, however inspired by admiration.
Rather, it is a kind of cannibalization, with one singer feeding on
a more singular existing voice and saying: ``Hey, I can do that.
But this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the greatest vocalists started out imitating somebody.
Sinatra had Bing Crosby; Dylan, Woody Guthrie. Billie Holiday
readily acknowledged both Bessie Smith and Louis Armstrong as
models: Smith for her ``big sound,'' Armstrong for his feeling. Yet
how quickly did these artists transmute their influences into
something wholly original.
</P>
<P>
   Raquel Bitton, 38, a cabaret singer from San Francisco, is, to
put it mildly, stuck on Edith Piaf. Since discovering the repertory
of Piaf in 1982, Ms. Bitton, who was herself born in Marrakesh,
Morocco, has helped produce a show about the legendary French
chanteuse for National Public Radio, consulted on a television
documentary, composed a play with music about Piaf's friendship
with Jean Cocteau, written the scenario for a full-length Piaf
ballet and, most decisively, learned to sing very much like her
idol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raquel Bitton Sings Edith Piaf (The Golden Album)'' (Sparrow
Productions RB4271-2), Ms. Bitton's new CD, is an eerie study in
the outer limits of vocal impressionism. There is the exacting
verisimilitude with which Ms. Bitton (abetted by her elegant
arranger, Bob Holloway) recreates the orchestral environment that
contributed so much to Piaf's mystique: brusque horn- and
string-driven orchestrations, lush and spiny all at once, a velvet
grip that could break a listener in two.
</P>
<P>
   There is the unmistakable passion Ms. Bitton brings to her
invocation of the Piaf vocal spirit, the requisite fierceness of
elocution, fluttery intensity of vibrato and Rs rolled like a
flotilla of drunken sailors along a seaside quay. There is also,
inescapably, more than a touch of ghoulishness about the precision
of this Piaf reanimation. In meticulously reflecting the glow of
Piaf's fire, Ms. Bitton buries most of the ``Little Sparrow's''
incandescence _ her utter emotional nakedness.
</P>
<P>
   Well, how could anyone recapture that? The quality that made
Piaf's singing Piaf was ... well, Piaf. The qualities that make Ms.
Bitton the singer are difficult to define beyond the influences of
Piaf, which is in no way to diminish her accomplishment here but
only to wonder at it.
</P>
<P>
   Unsurprisingly, the differences are the most revealing. Where
Piaf's voice was, indomitably, a brass instrument, Ms. Bitton's is
more a harder-to-tune reed. Where Piaf slugged out signature tunes
like ``Mon Legionnaire'' at unflinching tempos, Ms. Bitton chooses
a milk-the-emotion pace that adds almost a minute to Piaf's
original recording of that song. Given Piaf's own penchant for
melodrama, that's an awful lot of extra bathos to bathe in.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bitton has recorded three previous CDs. On two of them, ``In
a Jazzy Mood'' and ``I Wish You Love,'' as well as on this one, her
affinity for the music of French popular songwriters of the period
from the 1930s to the 1950s defines her. The spotlight she throws
on these neglected masters _ Paul Misraki, Charles Trenet and Henri
Contet _ is welcome. Though they were a generation of imitators in
their own right, each transcended imitation by re-rendering the
style and substance of the American popular song with a French
spin.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bitton's most adventurous outing is the CD on which she
sounds the least comfortable, ``Changes'' (1996), a
Piaf-goes-to-Nashville take on American country-western tunes
addressed as French chansons. Here, venturing far from her sources,
Ms. Bitton, while much at sea stylistically, reveals more of
herself emotionally, her vocal tone both lighter and more lyrically
exposed, her vibrato less assaultively combative.
</P>
<P>
   We live in imitative musical times, and Ms. Bitton is hardly
alone. Singers like Bobby Caldwell release retro recordings of
vintage Sinatra and Bobby Darin that nearly replicate the
originals. The dominion of hip-hop regards sampling as its power
and glory.
</P>
<P>
   Celine sounds like Streisand, and Mariah like Whitney _ or is it
the other way around? In opera, every new tenor is the next Domingo
or Pavarotti. On Broadway, mimetic musicals like ``Kat and the
Kings,'' ``Swing'' and ``Saturday Night Fever'' are to their
musical sources as minstrelsy once was to African-American musical
expression; grotesque, clownishly imitative diminishments of
doo-wop, big-band jazz and disco, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, these shows offer contemporary audiences a brush with
something predating current MTV sounds. But one wonders what any
listener might take away from these encounters. Can such pallid
imitation illuminate anything at all?
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, there are still exceptions. Harry Connick Jr. and
Diana Krall started out imitating other singers _ he the younger
Sinatra, she Nat Cole. Both, however, have evolved into distinctive
vocal artists. And there is nothing remotely pallid about Ms.
Bitton's Piaf tribute. No doubt it will send a few people out to
buy her CD and many more back to the racks for Piaf's own discs.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't it be nice, though, if more than a few kept on
listening for a singer with something to say that we haven't
already heard _ and, more important, don't already know?

AS THE GOOD TIMES ROLL, EVEN MARXISTS ARE MELLOWING  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 16) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa)   (af)  
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It is remarkable how a booming economy flattens
ideology in this post-cold-war era. The good times in America have
many economists rewriting their views, and none more so than those
who see the world through Marxist eyes. Only the final outcome _
the Day of Reckoning _ sets the Marxists clearly apart from
mainstream economics. And the Day of Reckoning has been postponed.
</P>
<P>
   No one expected the current economic expansion, which started in
1991, to last so long. Certainly not the Marxists, who hold that
too much of the national income has gone to corporate profits in
the 1990s and not enough to labor, a painful imbalance that cannot
be sustained indefinitely. Now that view is being edited. A rising
tide that keeps on rising quiets a lot of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the expansion continues another three to five years,'' said
Ismael Hossein-Zadeh, a Marxist economist at Drake University in
Des Moines, ``the trickle-down effect is bound to be seen
increasingly in wages.'' That raises the possibility, he said, that
the workers, instead of protesting, could get ``sucked into'' the
good times.
</P>
<P>
   Few mainstream economists _ or mainstream politicians _ would
disagree. Democratic and Republican economic policies count on this
happening. The Marxists differ mainly in degree. They do not
believe that companies competing for labor in an expanding economy
will raise incomes enough; they want government intervention to
make income distribution more equal.
</P>
<P>
   They mention measures like a higher minimum wage or laws that
strengthen unions, policies that many non-Marxists also favor. But
for the moment, government intervention gets soft-pedaled almost
everywhere in economics.
</P>
<P>
   Having been wrong so often about when the expansion would end,
economists of all stripes are self-consciously covering all the
bases. Plausibility seems to require no less when so many Americans
respond to polls by saying that they see no end to the good times.
So Anthony Gabb, a Marxist economist at St. John's University in
New York City, offers a forecast acceptable today even on Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this expansion continues for 5 to 10 years, I would not be
surprised one bit,'' he said. ``But by the same token, if the
economy went into recession soon, I would not be surprised
either.''
</P>
<P>
   The long-running expansion came up often at the annual meetings
here last weekend of the American Economic Association and various
other social science groups. To most of the economists, the
expansion reflects a well-functioning free market and some good
luck. For the Marxists, the expansion is an anomaly requiring
explanations. Their organization, the Union for Radical Political
Economists, offered the only session devoted entirely to ``The U.S.
Expansion and What Comes Next.''
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream economists see the expansion as a phenomenon that can
continue indefinitely, until some outside shock or policy mistake
provokes a recession. A stock market sell-off could be such a
shock, or a financial crisis that frightens lenders, who then stop
lending; or the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates too far,
or be too slow to lower them in a pinch. The Fed has been blamed
for almost every recession since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The Marxists, in contrast, believe that the expansion contains
the seeds of its own undoing. Their latest revisions try to explain
why it is not yet undone. Some skate pretty close to mainstream
economics.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion, in the Marxist view, is a long upward wave that
started in the '80s, when business got the upper hand over labor
and profits rose. Stability, capital investment, new technology,
rising productivity _ all have reinforced profits, the Marxists
explain. And the brief 1990-91 recession did not stop the wave.
These are observations heard from mainstream economists, too.
</P>
<P>
   The New Economy enthusiasts, in particular, are finding kindred
spirits in a strange place. Or as Gabb put it, ``The system is more
resilient than we may want it to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the undoing will come in the struggle to consume all the
output. Wages are rising, the Marxists acknowledge, but not fast
enough. So people borrow, helped by the strong stock market, and
credit flows in from abroad. Rising debt loads are part of any
expansion, but this one is getting to the point that people are
borrowing more just to make payments on existing debt. A shock to
this fragile structure would bring it down.
</P>
<P>
   That is farther than most mainstream economists will go. They,
too, worry about debt, but without a Marxist's pessimism. The
mainstreamers generally hold that policy can save the day. The Fed,
for example, can defuse a debt crisis by quickly lowering rates, a
move that would preserve the expansion and reassure workers.
</P>
<P>
   Marxists doubt that it would be so easy. Much of labor's
``passive acceptance,'' said Fred Moseley, a Marxist economist at
Mount Holyoke College, in a recent paper, ``has been based on the
optimistic premise that the years of `pain' will soon be over and
the U.S. economy will soon return to the more prosperous conditions
of the postwar period, with its steady and substantial increases in
real wages.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Continued stagnation, or worse, would invalidate this
premise,'' he said. ``Perhaps then acceptance will turn into
resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But for now, wages are rising.

 MOB RULE: `Sopranos' Resumes Its Morality Tale With a Twist  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 (Eds: Review of ``City of Angels'' follows.)  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bada-bing! ``The Sopranos,'' TV's best and most lethal drama, is
back for 13 more episodes of glorious banality on HBO.
</P>
<P>
   The cable sensation picks up right where it left off. New Jersey
mobster Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) is still in his strange
funk. His wife, Carmela (Emmy winner Edie Falco), is an exquisite
study in deadpan misery. Tony's mother, Livia (Nancy Marchand), is
in the hospital, and his Uncle Junior (Dominic Chianese) is in the
slammer.
</P>
<P>
   And Tony's psychoanalyst, Dr. Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco),
is in a spectacular snit. It's a bad business, treating mafiosi.
One of her patients has committed suicide because Melfi was
distracted by a Mafia incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many more people have to die because of your personal
growth?'' Melfi asks her most dangerous patient.
</P>
<P>
   Aida Turturro (actors John and Nicholas Turturro are her
cousins) joins the cast Sunday as Tony's ne'er-do-well sister,
Janice. She's scammed her carpal tunnel syndrome disability to the
max back in Seattle and now has a fishy eye on Livia's health and
personal holdings.
</P>
<P>
   If there's a qualitative change from last season, it's in that
barely discernible lift, that extra iota of confidence, that comes
with flash success.
</P>
<P>
   The popular take on ``The Sopranos'' is that it's a dark comedy
about a crook who's also a family man with a thin streak of
normality. But ``The Sopranos'' is more than that.
</P>
<P>
   Series creator David Chase has trimmed the ornate Mafia
orthodoxy of countless movies and TV shows to working size. These
are Jersey strip-mall mobsters. They're ``The Godfather'' without
grand opera.
</P>
<P>
   But while he's fashioned a perfectly authentic batch of modern
mafiosi, Chase has kept and perhaps even improved upon the Mario
Puzo-Francis Ford Coppola saga's notion of corruptive evil.
</P>
<P>
   That's what is too easy to miss in the appeal of the show's cool
grit. There's a reason Tony can't find his bliss at home; at his
strip-joint hangout, the Bada-Bing Club; or in his psychoanalyst's
office. He's a criminal; his life has rotted from the inside out.
</P>
<P>
   The show's rough language _ there are more f-words in one hour
of ``The Sopranos'' than some of the more sheltered among us will
hear in a lifetime _ is symptomatic of the spiritual emptiness in
the characters' lives.
</P>
<P>
   The f-word as an adjective serves to demean the noun it
modifies. As a nonsexual verb, it demeans the direct object. The
language itself is life-negating, and the negation of life is the
rampant disease corrupting Tony's two families, biological and
criminal.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, how better to explain the homicidal
relationship between Tony and his mother? She approved a hit on
Tony last season. He retaliated by contemplating snuffing her in
her hospital bed.
</P>
<P>
   So the mother-child bond, that eternal icon of literature and
popular sentiment, is turned on its head. The mother is supposed to
be the wellspring of life, the selfless nurturer. Tony's take on
Livia: ``She's the devil.''
</P>
<P>
   Here and there, as a new season of ``The Sopranos'' gets under
way, Tony is urged to reconcile with Livia. He won't hear of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's dead to me,'' he says repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   But Tony's real problem is his realization, vague but achingly
persistent, that he's dead to himself. His life is an exercise in
his putative occupation, waste management.
</P>
<P>
   That makes ``The Sopranos'' better than cool; that makes it an
inherently smart morality tale.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
-0- &QC;
</P>
<P>
   CBS' ``City of Angels'' comes with a Steven Bochco pedigree _
his producing partners are Emmy winners Paris Barclay and Nicholas
Wootton _ and seemingly perfect timing.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the networks are being criticized for neglecting
minorities on both sides of the camera, this new hospital drama is
television's great black hope. The show's cast and crew are
predominantly black.
</P>
<P>
   The midseason series begins with a deft Bochco touch, the freak
death of an overweight rhythm and blues singer. Guest star Garrett
Morris, as the medical director of Angels of Mercy, a rundown
public hospital in Los Angeles, pays a drunken visit to the famous
corpse.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK now, I know an autograph is out of the question,'' he says
to the bagged body, and then proceeds with a morbid photo op
instead. He's caught; exit Morris.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Vivica A. Fox as his no-nonsense replacement, Dr. Lillian
Price. She's an ``accreditation gunslinger'' who ``single-handedly
saved Oakland Memorial from closing.''
</P>
<P>
   Price inherits a staff that includes her former fiance, Dr. Ben
Turner (co-star Blair Underwood). She also inherits the tawdry side
of public health administration in the person of an overseeing
politician and apparent shoe fetishist, Edwin O'Malley (Robert
Morse).
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's episode, written by Bochco and Wootton, turns turgid
the moment Fox appears on the scene. Price is a humorless
character, and Fox is a pretty but flavorless actress. Underwood,
himself a somber presence onscreen, further deadens a dreary hour
of drama.
</P>
<P>
   The word is that ``City of Angels'' perks up and finds some
traction in subsequent episodes, so there is at least a scintilla
of hope for a show that's carrying an immense burden at birth.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone wants to see a winning black drama on TV, at long last,
and the CBS brass knows it would be impolitic to pull the plug
quickly on ``City of Angels.''
</P>
<P>
   But I know the succession of feelings I had in watching the
premiere. Succeed, please succeed. And then: End, please end.

 &HT;    Lindros learning to live with fame
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ More days should be like Wednesday. Eric Lindros
played golf. Lindros and several teammates played at Country Club
of the South, thanks to a connection of theirs named Tom Glavine.
Just golf and sunshine on a day off for the Philadelphia Flyers'
walking headline. No new trade rumors. No conspiracy theories about
auto wrecks. No new battles with the general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something I'm doing,'' Lindros said. Stories just
grow on him. Lindros and the Flyers make their first visit to
Philips Arena tonight to meet the Thrashers. Philly comes in with a
six-game winning streak and hopes of exorcising memories of a
fizzle-from-ahead 4-4 tie with the Thrashers three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   So much has happened since then. To recap:
</P>
<P>
   _ Lindros almost traded to Carolina! Keith Primeau's agent said
he held contract talks with Flyers general manager Bob Clarke,
thereby giving credence to previous reports that Carolina and
Philadelphia discussed a star swap.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lindros was driving! Actually, he was a passenger and his
girlfriend was driving when his car slid off a New Jersey road
after a New Year's Eve party. That didn't stop somebody from
screaming police cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lindros going to Toronto! A report out of Toronto, birthplace
of mutant hockey rumors, said Lindros will be traded to the Maple
Leafs for Mats Sundin. Lindros said, ``It was a load of (junk) in a
dry news week.''
</P>
<P>
   Controversy seemingly has swirled around Lindros since he was
drafted by Quebec in 1991. He wouldn't play for the Nordiques and
forced one of the biggest trades in league history. The Nordiques,
now Colorado, received six players, including Peter Forsberg, two
No. 1 draft picks and $15 million. Since then, Lindros has
attempted to live up to that price.
</P>
<P>
   But on-again, off-again collisions with Clarke and the fact that
he is playing under another one-year contract makes for an
uncertain future _ and wonderful fodder for speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of guys who go through it,'' Lindros said
Thursday after the Flyers practiced at Philips Arena. ``Rumors can
be started easily. That's just the way it is. A lot of things that
you hear, there's no backing to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it started a few years ago, it did affect me. Nobody
wants to put their heart into something and then you hear that you
might be traded and _whatever. But there's nothing you can do about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindros addressed his teammates in October, after the Flyers
started the season 0-5-1. He told them he had let the off-ice stuff
affect him but that it wasn't going to be the case in the future.
The Flyers are 25-6-5 since.
</P>
<P>
   He has struggled of late. He has scored just one goal in his
past 10 games and missed two others because of a chipped bone in
his left hand. But he said, ``In the past week, it has felt a lot
better.''
</P>
<P>
   The psyche apparently has healed as well, at least until the
contract rhetoric heats up again after the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything he does is monitored and blown out of proportion,''
teammate John LeClair said. ``It makes it difficult for him. But
through the years, I think he's (learned) that comes with being a
superstar. He's been real good about being able to focus on hockey.
Trade rumors are just a part of hockey. You can't sit there and
play scared.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers have grown so accustomed to this that they don't
believe it will derail their Stanley Cup hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be a problem, but it hasn't been,'' coach Roger
Neilson said. ``Right now, it's not a problem.''

PARCELLS AND BELICHICK MEET ON THE LEGAL FIELD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the first time since Bill Belichick walked out on
Bill Parcells last week, ending their 16-year football
relationship, the two former Jets' coaches met face to face
Thursday at a hearing in the National Football League's legal
offices in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells was described by Belichick's defense team as a
``hostile witness'' at the eight-hour hearing, which was called by
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue to determine the validity of
Belichick's contract with the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Only three people testified at the law offices of Skadden Arps
on the 38th floor of 4 Times Square _ Parcells, Belichick, and,
surprisingly, Charlie Weis. He is the Jets' offensive coordinator
who was called by Belichick's lawyer, Neil Cornrich.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue said in a statement he would rule on the dispute next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick resigned as Jets coach last week, one day after he had
succeeded Parcells. The Jets have contended that Belichick's
contract called for him to take over if Parcells stepped down. But
Belichick, who had three years remaining on his contract, claimed
that the uncertainty about who the new owner would be and Parcells'
role in the front office, made the job impossible to take.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Wood Johnson IV agreed to buy the team last Tuesday for
$635 million. That sale is expected to be approved by the league
owners next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells entered the building looking glum. He testified for an
hour, and left, refusing to talk to reporters. He walked north on
Sixth Avenue and then, at the urging of the team's security
director, who saw about 40 reporters and television crew chasing
him, made a quick left turn and disappeared among the noontime
crush of pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
   Weis followed Parcells at the hearing, testifying for about
three minutes. After Belichick finished his afternoon of testimony,
Jets president Steve Gutman presented the Jets' case.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick was the only principal of the hearing who consented to
an interview afterward. ``I appreciate the opportunity to present
our case before the NFL and would hope for a quick resolution,'' he
said. ``That's really all I can say at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   However, another of Belichick's lawyers, Jeffrey Kessler, a
sports antitrust lawyer who has represented the players unions of
major league baseball, football and hockey, said that if Tagliabue
ruled against his client, they would take the case to the federal
courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The league cannot stop other teams from making offers to, and
hiring, coaches if they would like someone as their head coach,''
he said
</P>
<P>
   Kessler added, ``If the league does not agree with us, we will
take this further.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether this meant seeking redress in the federal
courts, Kessler said, ``We believe the law is very clear. The
courts would not prohibit someone from making a living.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, claimed Kessler, his case was bolstered because,
he said, the Jets have said they would not take Belichick back.
Thus, according to the attorney, they are preventing him from
making a living.
</P>
<P>
   Asked last week in a conference call if he could see Belichick
back on the Jets, Parcells, ``I don't think so. There is no
possibility that would happen, I would think.''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately thereafter, Parcells is expected to name his new
head coach _ which some people expect might be himself again.
</P>
<P>
   But Belichick had been targeted for that post for three years.
He actually was the Jets' head coach before Parcells during the
tumultuous legal wrangling involving the Patriots. At that point,
the Patriots claimed that Parcells was under contract to them, so
the Jets made Belichick their head coach until Parcells could step
in. Shortly after, the Pats and Jets made a deal for draft picks,
that allowed Parcells to become a Jet. Belichick resumed his
accustomed role of Parcells' defensive coordinator, but his
contract called for him to succeed Parcells one day.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday was not about football. All the principals were
brought together in one room. Tagliabue was there for about an
hour. When he entered the building, he said he hoped ``we can get
this resolved fairly and expeditiously.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Ingraham, a friend of Belichick's going back to their days
at Wesleyan University, and a sports attorney, said that everyone
sat at one table.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was big and expensive,'' said Ingraham, when asked to
describe the table. &QL;

 &HT;    Manning's the man in Tennessee
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Is Tennessee still Peyton's Place?
</P>
<P>
   As Tennessee prepares for the biggest pro football game in its
history, the state feels torn loyalties.
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee Titans, in their second season in Nashville, will
face the Colts and former University of Tennessee quarterback
Peyton Manning in an AFC playoff game Sunday in Indianapolis' RCA
Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Do Tennessee football fans cheer for the home team or their most
beloved homeboy?
</P>
<P>
   Manning, preparing for his first NFL playoff game, seems unfazed
by the attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize the unique situation of it,'' he said, ``but it's an
NFL playoff game. That's how I'm approaching it. I know nobody on
the Titans cares where I went to college. I also know nobody on the
Colts cares where I went to college, either. That's kind of the end
of the story.''
</P>
<P>
   But Manning is still the big story in Tennessee, where he was an
All-America passer with the Vols. Manning endeared himself to
locals by passing up the NFL draft in 1997 to return to school for
his senior season. As the Vols' starter, he had a 39-6 record, led
the school to the 1997 SEC championship and broke 33 school, eight
conference and two NCAA records.
</P>
<P>
   After the Colts drafted Manning No. 1 in the 1998 draft,
Indianapolis sold several season tickets in Tennessee, where the
quarterback has more than one street and dozens of children named
for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here think Peyton Manning hung the moon, and that
hasn't changed,'' said Tony Basilio, who hosts a sports-talk show
on WIMZ radio in Knoxville. ``Even though he didn't win a national
championship, he will always be the Tennessee football legend.''
</P>
<P>
   While Manning remains a hero in Tennessee, fans were slow to
accept the Titans after owner Bud Adams moved the former Houston
Oilers there in July 1997. The team spent one season in Memphis and
another in Nashville at Vanderbilt, playing in a half-empty
stadium. During the transition, fans seemed more captivated by
Manning's Heisman Trophy campaign in 1997 and the Vols' national
title the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Adams learned the degree of Manning's popularity when Titans
running back Eddie George admitted in 1997 that he voted for
Michigan's Charles Woodson for the Heisman. ``It wasn't the popular
thing, to be a Tennessee Oiler fan around here,'' George recalled.
</P>
<P>
   It still isn't in Knoxville, where Mayor Victor Ashe said he
would not want to write his ``political obituary'' by choosing
sides.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, a former Tennessee governor whose
presidential campaign headquarters is located in Nashville, also
took a diplomatic approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be looking out for the hometown boy, and hoping he has a
great game, but he'll be cheering for the Titans,'' a Gore
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Nashville area, Manning might have more fans than
the Titans do. While Adams envisioned the Titans being Tennessee's
team, the rest of the state largely has ignored them.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the Titans sold 80 percent of their single-game
tickets to buyers from Nashville and surrounding Middle Tennessee.
Of the 50,000 preferred-seating leases in the team's new Adelphia
Coliseum, more than 80 percent were sold to those same fans.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, more of the leases were sold in Kentucky and Alabama
than the 1.8 percent bought in Knoxville, about 180 miles from
Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ``People make it seem like it's your obligation to cheer for the
Tennessee Titans,'' WIMZ's Basilio said. ``But that's not the case
at all. They're a Johnny-come-lately. They're the flavor of the
month. ... People here want to see Peyton Manning. People in East
Tennessee despise the Titans. They're really a Nashville team, but
they're trying to capitalize on a statewide name.''
</P>
<P>
   The Titans might be the flavor of the month, but they're still
not Big Orange.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as Dec. 19, Manning fans implored the Fox television
station in Knoxville to dump the Titans-Falcons game for the
Colts-Redskins matchup. Sentiment was so lopsided _ reportedly 20
to 1 in favor of Manning's team _ that WTNZ-TV general manager Rick
Lipps eventually relented.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would you want to watch one person over a whole team?''
Lipps said. ``Nothing against Peyton Manning or Indianapolis, but
you know, these are the Tennessee Titans.''
</P>
<P>
   George said, ``The pendulum has changed dramatically this
season.'' The Titans, with the AFC's third-best record at 14-3,
sold out every game at Adelphia and went 9-0 at home. A record
crowd of 66,782 fans watched the Titans beat Buffalo 22-16 last
week in an AFC wild-card game, decided on an improbable kickoff
return with 3 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to hate bandwagon jumpers,'' said Titans tight end
Frank Wycheck, who threw the cross-field lateral that started the
return. ``Now, I love them.''

MANUFACTURERS SIGNAL WILLINGNESS TO WORK FOR MEDICARE COVERAGE OF
DRUGS
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Drug company executives asked the White House on
Thursday for a cease-fire in their war over drug prices and said
unequivocally that they wanted to work with President Clinton and
Congress to establish Medicare coverage of prescription drugs this
year.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the industry had said it could accept Medicare
coverage of prescription drugs only as part of a comprehensive plan
to redesign the entire Medicare program. Companies feared that
government-subsidized coverage of drugs would lead to government
efforts to set drug prices, an idea the industry firmly opposes.
</P>
<P>
   But now spokesmen for the industry _ Gordon M. Binder, chairman
of Amgen, and Raymond V. Gilmartin, chairman of Merck _ say they
could accept legislation to provide Medicare drug benefits this
year, as a step toward comprehensive changes in the program, which
finances health care for 39 million people who are elderly or
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``If comprehensive reform does not occur this year,'' Gilmartin
said, ``we would support federal legislation to provide all seniors
with access to pharmaceutical insurance coverage.'' If properly
designed, he said, such legislation could get medicines to people
who need them without controlling drug prices.
</P>
<P>
   With Congress scheduled to reconvene later this month, the issue
of Medicare coverage for prescription drugs is very much alive.
Democrats see the issue as a winner and promise to keep up a
drumbeat for coverage on Capitol Hill and in election campaigns
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs have become an indispensable part of modern health care.
Medicare's failure to cover drugs for people outside the hospital
is widely seen as the biggest gap in the 35-year-old program. But
plugging the hole is an immense challenge. Even well-run health
insurance plans report that spending on drugs is rising more than
15 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Binder and Gilmartin said they were tired of being criticized by
the White House and wanted to set a constructive, pragmatic and
positive tone for the coming debate on Medicare drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint interview, the two men seemed slightly nervous and
said they worried that Clinton would attack their industry in his
State of the Union Message on Jan. 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``If very important people in America say bad things about the
industry, that's harmful to us,'' said Binder, who was speaking as
chairman of the industry's main trade group, the Pharmaceutical
Research and Manufacturers of America.
</P>
<P>
   The drug executives said their statements reflected policies
endorsed this week by the executive committee of their trade
association.
</P>
<P>
   The overtures could be a ploy to take heat off the industry,
some Democrats said, but they could also be a catalyst for
negotiations. As for the harsh words exchanged with the White House
in the past, Binder said: ``That was then, and this is now. We
sense that all sides are moving in more of a positive direction to
get something done. We want to be part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the industry's position has really changed, top
executives are trying to sound more conciliatory, and that could be
almost as significant. It suggests that they see Medicare drug
coverage as inevitable and want to make the best deal possible.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials welcomed the overtures, but said the
president would keep pushing his plan for Medicare coverage of
drugs. They refused to say whether Clinton would tone down his
criticism of drug companies if the industry toned down its
criticism of his proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jennings, the health policy coordinator at the White
House, said: ``The pharmaceutical executives explicitly told us
that they would soften their rhetoric. That would certainly be a
constructive step. But only time will tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel P. Johnson, a senior adviser to the president, said on
Thursday night, ``We've heard some positive words and are looking
forward to positive deeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Drug executives have just recently recovered from the drubbing
they took in 1993 and 1994, when the president and Hillary Rodham
Clinton assailed drug companies as greedy price gougers. The
industry wants to avoid a repetition of that fight, and drug
executives conveyed that message to White House officials who
designed the president's latest proposal.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, drug companies said they saw only one way to
provide drug benefits to Medicare beneficiaries: through health
maintenance organizations and other private health plans that serve
16 percent of the people on Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Now the industry says it sees a need to provide drug coverage
for the 84 percent of Medicare beneficiaries still in the original
fee-for-service program.
</P>
<P>
   Binder said the government could make money available to private
entities _ insurance companies and pharmaceutical benefit managers
_ who could buy drugs and negotiate discounts on behalf of people
in the fee-for-service program.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This idea is somewhat similar to the president's proposal and to
a bill introduced in August by Sens. Olympia J. Snowe, R-Maine, and
Ron Wyden, D-Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Binder acknowledged that the government would need to set ``some
minimum standards'' for such drug benefits. ``Any company that
wanted to provide services within those ground rules could apply to
do so,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Picking up this theme, Gilmartin said: ``One could envision a
drug-only insurance option, with plans competing against one
another. The important principle is that these insurance plans
would compete for Medicare beneficiaries, not for a contract with
the federal government. That's a key distinction.''
</P>
<P>
   The new stance was prompted, in part, by the comments of Clinton
administration officials who said last month that the industry
would bring price controls on itself if it kept resisting public
demands for Medicare drug coverage. After reading those remarks,
the executives said, they were shaken, but also saw some hopeful
signs, and they requested a White House meeting to search for
common ground.
</P>
<P>
   Drug company executives said they had begun asking the same
question as Clinton: Why are they working frantically to develop
great new medicines for the elderly if many of the intended
beneficiaries cannot get or afford them?
</P>
<P>
   Under the president's proposal, Medicare would pay half of a
beneficiary's drug expenses, up to certain limits. The maximum
federal payment would start at $1,000 a year and would rise
gradually to $2,500 in 2008.
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies infuriated the White House last year when they
attacked Clinton's proposal in a series of television and newspaper
advertisements featuring an arthritic Medicare beneficiary named
Flo. The advertisements suggested that the Clinton plan would put
big government inside the family medicine chest and force all the
elderly into a government-run insurance plan.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Clinton complained that the industry had blocked
congressional action on prescription drugs by spending ``millions
of dollars on an all-out media campaign filled with flat-out
falsehoods.'' He ordered ``a sweeping study'' to document the
impact of high drug prices on the elderly. Democrats say the study
will provide them with ammunition for daily denunciations of the
drug industry.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmartin said that if Flo reappeared on television, she would
not just criticize Clinton's plan. ``It's important now for Flo to
also be for something positive,'' Gilmartin said.

U.S. PUTS A LOW PROFILE ON MEETING WITH CHECHEN FOREIGN MINISTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By JANE PERLEZ    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The State Department said Thursday that several
``working level'' officials would meet with the foreign minister of
Chechnya after deciding that a session with senior administration
officials would confer too much legitimacy on the breakaway Russian
republic.
</P>
<P>
   To set further distance, Thursday night's meeting with the
Chechen minister, Ilyas Akhmadov, was to take place in a hotel
lobby and not in the State Department building.
</P>
<P>
   ``These discussions do not constitute a change in policy or
recognition of Chechnya in any way, shape or form,'' said James P.
Rubin, the State Department spokesman. He said the United States
did not recognize Akhmadov as the foreign minister of an
independent Chechnya but as a private citizen of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   An official from the Office of Russian Affairs and officials
from bureaus dealing with refugees and human rights were designated
to meet with Akhmadov.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government protested Akhmadov's plan for a visit and
asked that he not be granted a visa, State Department officials
said. After a background check showed that Akhmadov had not
committed any offenses that would bar him, he was given a visa,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Thursday, Akhmadov said he had come to
Washington to ask the Clinton administration to pressure Moscow to
open negotiations to end the war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not asking for money or weapons,'' said Akhmadov, 39,
who has a degree in philosophy from Rostov State University. ``What
we are asking for is some attention, consultations, advice, good
will, and if that happens, we are convinced we can create a normal,
civilized country.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that negotiations were necessary because neither side
could win the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last war, no one won,'' he said, referring to the
1994-96 conflict, in which he fought and which ended with Russian
troops withdrawing from Chechnya. ``We humiliated the Russian army,
but the peace we achieved was fragile. We don't really feel this
war will bring victory to either side.''
</P>
<P>
   In the current war, now that the Russian army has advanced into
positions closer to the Chechen fighters, the Chechen forces are
faring better, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian army resembles a wild boar being attacked by very
vicious dogs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the flexibility and the hit-and-run tactics of the
Chechen forces, whose main weapon is an old Russian
rocket-propelled grenade launcher, the loss of the Chechen capital,
Grozny, would not be a big blow, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grozny is a convenient place from where we can strike and
retreat,'' Akhmadov said. ``If we lose it, we can find someplace
else to strike and retreat.''

CONNER RUNS AFOUL OF SAIL CONTROVERSY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   AUCKLAND, N.Z. _ Had they not used an illegal rudder in race one
of the Louis Vuitton semifinals, Stars &AMP; Stripes could be well on
its way to one of the two berths in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   The team was docked a point by the jury for using a rudder it
had built in Australia, a breach of the nationality clause of the
America's Cup protocol.
</P>
<P>
   But things may be getting worse for Team Dennis Conner, which
began this regatta as a long shot and survived to this point as
seven other syndicates _ many of them better funded and with
two-boat programs were eliminated by the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, the Prada syndicate filed a protest against
Stars &AMP; Stripes, claiming the team has been using a high-tech
mainsail whose design it got from Young America, which would be a
violation of the rule that prohibits the 11 challenger syndicates
from sharing technology.
</P>
<P>
   Prada claims the Stars &AMP; Stripes mainsail is ``the product of
the intellectual creativity and judgment of the Young America
design programme.'' It is, they claim, a sail Young America began
making but no longer needed when it failed to make the regatta's
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   But Stars &AMP; Stripes senior afterguard member and rules expert
Tom Whidden said the charge is ridiculous and should not even be
accepted for consideration by the jury. Whidden called the protest
a ``desparate measure'' by a team that is afraid it may lose to
Stars &AMP; Stripes on the water. ``It's just kind of sad they would
stoop to this,'' Whidden said.
</P>
<P>
   But Prada's general manager, Laurent Esquier, denied the Stars &AMP;
Stripes claim that Prada withheld the protest until its own chances
came down to a do-or-die race between the two, scheduled for
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a political move to do this now,'' said Esquier.
``We wanted to avoid a frivolous case, and we would not do this if
we didn't have legs to stand on.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars &AMP; Stripes' operations manager, Bill Trenkle, chimed in to
deny the charges. ``The sail was not designed by Young America,''
he said. ``These are desperate people taking desperate measures to
ty and win this off the water.''
</P>
<P>
   If the two do race, a win by Prada would end the whole
controversy. But a Stars &AMP; Stripes win could be subject to the
ruling of an international jury and arbitration panel if Prada's
protest is accepted for deliberation.
</P>
<P>
   In the earlier case of the illegal rudder, the arbitration panel
found that Stars &AMP; Stripes used a rudder in its opening race
against Japan that it had had manufactured in Australia, though
with materials and a design from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Finding the Conner syndicate guilty meant stripping the team of
the point it had won against Japan. In its defense, Stars &AMP; Stripes
said it had interpreted the rules differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that case, we screwed up,'' said Whidden. ``But in this
case, there's nothing there. This is just harassment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Italian syndicate also launched a derisive accusation at
AmericaOne Thursday, claiming skipper Paul Cayard had thrown his
race aginst Stars &AMP; Stripes, allowing the Conner team to stay in
the running. As Cayard came back to his dock after the loss, he
found, lining the Italian dock next door, a dozen or so syndicate
members wearing makeshift Pinocchio noses, fashioned out of paper
cones _ a gesture accusing Cayard of lying about trying to beat
Stars &AMP; Stripes.
</P>
<P>
   Cayard said he was upset by the Italian jibes. As skipper of
Italy's Il Moro, winner of the Louis Vuitton Cup in 1992, Cayard
became something of a national hero in Italy, hailed as the
country's adopted son, ``Paulo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will just have to live with what's in my heart,'' he said at
a packed post-race press conference in which he faced many hostile
questions. ``And I know in my heart we tried very hard to win the
race.''
</P>
<P>
   At the close of the press conference, Bill Koch, who was the
17th man aboard AmericaOne Thursday, took the microphone and made
an emotional speech. Said Koch, once a bitter rival who beat Cayard
for the America's Cup in 1992, ``I've sailed more than 100 races
against Paul Cayard, and there's no way he tried to throw that
race.''

BOY WHO KILLED GETS 7 YEARS AS JUDGE CRITICIZES LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (subs grafs 10 and 18 to give victim's full name on first reference
_ Ronnie Greene Jr.; story is now 2 takes)

<P>
   PONTIAC, Mich. _ A state judge here ruled Thursday that the
youngest American ever charged and convicted as an adult of murder
will serve a seven-year sentence at a maximum-security juvenile
detention center and then be released. The unexpectedly lenient
sentence stunned prosecutors and disappointed lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland County Circuit Court Judge Eugene Arthur Moore rejected
prosecutors' request that Nathaniel Abraham, 13, who was convicted
of a murder committed when he was 11, be sentenced to serve
additional time in an adult prison unless he has clearly been
rehabilitated by the age of 21. Moore also read from the bench a
ringing denunciation of the national trend over the last decade
toward trying and sentencing younger and younger children as
adults, saying that society has leaned too far toward punishment
instead of rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Moore called for changes in the 3-year-old law that makes it
possible for children of any age to be tried as adults in Michigan.
He called the law ``fundamentally flawed'' and suggested that the
state return to its practice before 1997 of reserving such trials
and sentences for children who are at least 14 when they commit
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Legislature has responded to juvenile criminal activity
not by helping to prevent and rehabilitate, but rather by treating
juveniles more like adults,'' Moore said in his sentencing opinion.
``The real solution is to prevent an adult criminal population ever
coming into existence.''
</P>
<P>
   State lawmakers across the country have been rewriting juvenile
justice codes in response to some constituents' demands that they
get tough on young offenders accused of terrible crimes. But
critics contend, and Moore agreed Thursday, that the juvenile
justice system has far more success at rehabilitation than the
adult correctional system.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan House Speaker Charles Perricone, a Republican who
helped write the state's strict juvenile justice law, said changes
in the law were unlikely as long as Republicans controlled the
state's House, Senate and the governor's mansion. ``At the end of
the day, someone, and I had hoped it would be the judge, should
stand up and ask one simple question: does this individual present
a danger to society?'' Perricone said in a telephone interview.
``We don't need judges on a soap box. We need judges who will
uphold the law.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John Engler opposes revising the law, particularly because
the state's prosecutors and judges endorsed it in 1996, said Susan
Shafer, a spokeswoman for the governor.
</P>
<P>
   By coincidence, Moore was the president of the Michigan Probate
Judges Association when the law was adopted, and the association
endorsed the law then. Lisa Halushka, the family division chief in
the Oakland County prosecutor's office who was the lead prosecutor
in Nathaniel's case, said that because of this history, she was
especially stunned and disappointed by Thursday's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has left me speechless,'' she said. ``As soon as I got the
impression he would go straight juvenile, I thought: Michigan
Probate Judges Association.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel faces a pretrial hearing next week on a separate
charge of breaking into a garage shortly before the slaying. But he
had never been convicted of a crime before he went out on a
hillside on the evening of Oct. 19, 1997, and used a borrowed,
.22-caliber rifle with its gunstock missing to shoot Ronnie Greene
Jr., who was 18 and a stranger, once in the back of the head at a
range of more than 200 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Fieger, Nathaniel's lead lawyer, said that if Nathaniel
was guilty of anything, it was reckless use of a firearm. But
prosecutors presented evidence that Nathaniel had prepared for the
slaying by shooting at balloons, and had later boasted about the
killing to friends at his elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   Moore has declined all interviews during the trial, and did so
again Thursday. He has handled Nathaniel's case from the beginning,
and granted prosecutors permission to try Nathaniel as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   Under Michigan law, Moore had three sentencing options. He could
have sentenced Nathaniel to eight to 25 years in adult prison; time
in a juvenile detention center followed by a second sentencing
hearing between his 18th and 21st birthdays to decide on additional
time in an adult prison if he had not been fully rehabilitated; and
time only in a juvenile detention center. Prosecutors, who have
received some criticism here for harshness, recommended the second
option.
</P>
<P>
   At least 44 states have adopted new juvenile justice laws since
1992 that allow more children to be tried as adults.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   In one nationally publicized case, Kip Kinkel was sentenced in
November in Portland, Ore., to more than 111 years in prison
without possibility of parole for having fatally shot his parents
and two fellow high school students when he was 15 years old.
</P>
<P>
   There has been only one other case in Oakland County of
prosecutors' recommending a combination of juvenile and adult
crime. Moore also presided in that recent case, which involved a
home invasion by another offender who committed the crime at the
age of 16, Mrs. Halushka said. The offender, who was white,
received a six-month sentence in a county jail after he reached the
age of 18 in a juvenile detention center without showing that he
had been rehabilitated, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fieger welcomed Moore's decision, but said he would proceed with
his plan to appeal the jury's verdict last November. Nathaniel, who
wore a brown and gray shirt with khaki trousers, was expressionless
during the sentencing, but another of his lawyers, Daniel Bagdade,
said he had his hand on Nathaniel's shoulder and could feel his
client trembling.
</P>
<P>
   After the trial, Bagdade said, ``Nate looked up at me and the
first words out of his mouth were, `What happened?''' Nathaniel
will turn 14 next week, but psychologists testified at his trial
that he was mentally and emotionally impaired.
</P>
<P>
   Greene's relatives had varying reactions to the verdict. His
grandmother, Joanne Hayden, reacted calmly when the sentence was
read but a minute later leaned against a wall outside the courtroom
and began weeping while loudly crying, ``Oh, Ronnie, Oh, Ronnie,
Oh, my boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Hayden, the dead man's uncle, said he believed Nathaniel
should have received a combination of a juvenile and adult
sentence. Hayden also said that Michigan's law on young offenders
should remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel is black, as was Greene, and the case here has drawn
national attention from civil rights activists. Fieger and these
activists have contended that Nathaniel would have been treated
differently in this mostly white county if he were also white _ a
contention that Mrs. Halushka rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred protesters showed up for the hearing, with many
of them standing in wind-driven snow outside the courtroom, beating
drums and chanting slogans like ``Nathaniel, we love you.'' One of
the protest's leaders, the Rev. Al Sharpton of New York, said after
the sentencing that while he was pleased that Nathaniel would not
be sent to prison, he still believed that Nathaniel should have
been acquitted and that Michigan's juvenile justice laws should be
rewritten.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge said some strong and courageous things _ he
convicted the system but he incarcerated Nathaniel,'' Sharpton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, 64, has a national reputation as an experienced and
respected juvenile court judge. He was first elected as a juvenile
court judge in a countywide race in 1966, and has won every
reelection campaign since then, usually running unopposed; his
current, six-year term will not expire until the end of 2004. Moore
succeeded his father, Judge Arthur Eugene Moore, on the juvenile
court bench, and his father's portrait still hangs in the county
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Moore ``leans toward more lenient sentences,'' Mrs. Halushka
said. But in this heavily Republican county on the northern edge of
Detroit, the judge makes occasional appearances at Republican
fund-raisers, she said, while adding that elections for judges are
non-partisan and Moore ``is not super-political.''

JOCKEY YORK MAKES HISTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA -- His spirit was willing. So was his 66-year-old flesh.
Alas, Ray York's horse was weak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rode fitter than that horse ran,'' he joked after Thursday's
eighth race at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   In what is intended as a brief comeback, York finished
second-to-last a board a gelding named Culebra in the 11-horse
maiden sprint but accomplished his goal, becoming the first jockey
to compete in seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed it very, very much,'' he said after weighing in, not
visibly winded, his sweaty forehead dotted with racetrack dirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``He broke good, and down the backstretch I thought, `I got a
shot here!' ``But when I called on him, nothing. I wish I'd had
more horse, so I could have tried a little more of the horsemanship
I know.''
</P>
<P>
   Close to the lead between horses early, 37-1 Culebra quickly
dropped out of contention, safely on the outside of the pack.
Favored Slew Anew won the race to give jockey Corey Nakatani -- 37
years younger than York - - four victories two days in a row.
</P>
<P>
   For York, who rode 1954 Kentucky Derby champion Determine and
3,081 win winners between 1949 and his first retirement in 1985,
this probably was a one-race stunt, but you'd have to say he earned
the achievement.
</P>
<P>
   The Taft, Calif., native trimmed down to 113 pounds by
exercising horses for Culebra trainer Henry Moreno at Santa Anita
four mornings a week since September.
</P>
<P>
   Until Thursday, York was tied with Bill Shoemaker and two other
riders with the six-decades distinction. He had ridden in 1992 at
Bay Meadows and in Del Mar's Rocking Chair Derby for retired
jockeys later in the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Moreno wants York, a grandfather of five, to keep riding until
he wins a race. York's girlfriend, Michael McKay, may veto that
idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time he gets home and does chores again,'' she said.

ADVERTSING: VENTURE AIMS TO RECREATE HOLLYWOOD-MADISON AVENUE
ALLIANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: in references to (c)JWT, the (c) is a nontransmittable
typographical symbol that resembles a c with a circle around it,
similar to a copyright symbol)

 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a significant step toward bringing Madison Avenue
and Hollywood closer together, a giant agency is forming an
alliance with a powerful company specializing in talent management
and television and movie production. The affiliation is intended to
help advertisers exploit the puissant potentials inherent in
entertainment marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is J. Walter Thompson USA in New York, part of the
WPP Group, which works for clients like Ford Motor, Kellogg,
Merrill Lynch, PepsiCo, Philip Morris and Warner-Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   The Hollywood powerhouse is Basic Entertainment, which manages
actors like Nicolas Cage, Dana Carvey, Greg Kinnear, Brad Pitt and
Adam Sandler as well as producing cable and broadcast network
programs like ``The Sopranos,'' ``Politically Incorrect'' and
``Just Shoot Me.'' Basic also has film and Internet production
interests and represents authors like Martin Amis, Michael
Cunningham and Elmore Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson USA and Basic are forming a nonequity alliance through
a new agency marketing division, (c)JWT, with the ``(c)'' standing
for content. Basic will be compensated for its work with (c)JWT,
and Thompson USA will share in revenue from projects that reach
fruition; terms of those aspects of the agreement were not
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Access to and control of content, particularly in the realm of
entertainment, are the driving forces behind the transformations
reshaping the media landscape, as demonstrated by the startling
news this week that America Online would acquire Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's enormous potential to figuring out how to have some
effective relationship between advertisers and entertainment, and
ultimately the consumer,'' said Brad Grey, chairman at Basic,
formerly known as Brillstein-Grey Entertainment after Grey, the
deal-maker once called ``the new Michael Ovitz,'' and his mentor,
Bernie Brillstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear to us advertisers are a key part of the
entertainment process,'' Grey said in a telephone interview from
his office in Beverly Hills, Calif. ``The dialogue we've started
will help JWT and its clients get closer to the content, the
creative product we spend our time developing and producing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Thompson USA-Basic hookup is meant to extend beyond familiar
tactics like product placement, celebrity endorsements and
licensing by involving advertisers in the earliest stages of
content development. As such, it is perhaps the most ambitious
attempt to date at forging stronger ties between Madison Avenue and
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Other examples include the supervision of advertising for
Coca-Cola by Ovitz when he headed the Creative Artists Agency; the
purchase by Creative Artists of a minority stake in Shepardson
Stern &AMP; Kaminsky, a New York ad shop that works for clients like
Southern Co.; and the acquisitions of PMK, an entertainment
publicity agency, and Addis-Wechsler &AMP; Associates, a talent agency,
by the Interpublic Group of Companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 30-second television commercial is not going away, but it
will continue to be less important in the media mix,'' said Bob
Jeffrey, president at the Thompson New York unit of Thompson USA.
``If we are going to maintain our leading position in
communications, we're going to have to come up with more ways to
sell brands other than TV spots.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Agencies have played catch-up in the digital space,'' he
added. ``This is an opportunity to take the lead by developing
content offline and online, working with Brad Grey and his people
as a creative think tank to come up with fresh ideas about how to
go after consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the alliance will try to recreate the bonds
between Hollywood and Madison Avenue. From the 1930s through the
1950s, agencies were the traffic cops at the center of the
entertainment-advertising intersection, supervising the creation of
radio and television programs for clients from hiring stars and
writers to negotiating production deals with studios to placing the
series on networks.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson was a pioneer of that era, developing the long-running
``Lux Radio Theater,'' ``Kraft Music Hall'' and ``Kraft Television
Theater.'' All that ended when increasing production costs made
single-sponsored shows prohibitively expensive for advertisers, and
the TV networks asserted their authority to develop their own
schedules.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time when agencies controlled the airwaves and had
a pipeline to Hollywood,'' said Marina Hahn, who joined Thompson
New York in May as executive vice president for strategy and
entertainment from the William Morris Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we're no longer driving a lot of the big ideas that shape
popular culture,'' said Ms. Hahn, who will also head (c)JWT.
``Reopening the dialogue with the best minds in Hollywood is a way
to get back a competitive edge.''
</P>
<P>
   As Basic and (c)JWT begin working on projects for Thompson
clients, executives from both expressed their awareness of concerns
that the alliance could blur the lines between content and
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be `This actor better be out there saying good things
about our soap,''' said John Liebman, vice chairman at Basic, whose
friendship with Ms. Hahn was the genesis for the discussions
leading to the formation of the alliance. ``And our idea isn't to
get into the ad business.''

<P>
   Grey echoed those cautions, saying: ``It's not about bringing
the advertisers into the creative process. It's about making their
dollar a more efficient dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one project is already under way for a Thompson USA
client, Warner-Lambert. It's a comedy-centered idea for a new
product under the Listerine brand name.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the agency proposed this, we immediately leapt at it,''
said Marc Rovner, vice president for oral care and professional
markets at Warner-Lambert Consumer Health Care in Morris Plains,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``People consume media just as much as they consume any
product,'' he added. ``As media fractionate, people pick up
entertainment in places other than television.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Listerine project, ``we've talked with a comedy writer''
provided by Basic ``about a range of ideas like cinema advertising,
Internet `viral marketing,' comic books, even CDs,'' Rovner said.
``It's a real benefit to us.''
</P>
<P>
   But can Basic's brain trust top a poster that Listerine once
distributed on college campuses? If memory serves, the poster
showed a bottle of Listerine precariously perched on a ledge at
Notre Dame in Paris alongside a grotesque statue.
</P>

SURGEONS PERFORM RARE `DOMINO' LIVER TRANSPLANT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: N.J.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Paula Pereira had decided against millennial
celebrations and was relaxing at home on New Year's Eve in
Kenilworth, N.J., when her pager went off. It was a call from the
Lahey Clinic in suburban Burlington, notifying her that after a 2
1/2-year wait, a donor liver was available.
</P>
<P>
   As she jumped into her car and headed north on the 4 1/2-hour
drive, Lahey surgeons were scrambling to assemble a large team that
at 8 a.m. on New Year's Day would begin New England's first
``domino'' liver transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Pereira, 28, who has a rare genetic disease, successfully
received a healthy liver from a brain-dead donor and,
simultaneously, gave up her slightly abnormal liver to be implanted
into an older, extremely sick patient who might have no other shot
at a donor organ.
</P>
<P>
   At her young age, Pereira had yet to develop many symptoms of
the progressive disease, familial amyloidosis, in which a gene
mutation causes the liver to make an abnormal protein. Getting a
new liver forestalled the lethal buildup of protein that had killed
her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Even with its flaw, her liver was safely implanted into the
older patient, John Clarke, 65, of Gloucester, whose liver had been
severely damaged by hepatitis C. In time, the liver once belonging
to Pereira might make Clarke ill, but given his age and precarious
health, it might add years to his life.
</P>
<P>
   In the early hours of New Year's Day, when they were both being
prepared for surgery, Pereira met Clarke. ``It was a great
feeling,'' Pereira said.
</P>
<P>
   She was released from Lahey last Sunday. Clarke remains
hospitalized. The Lahey team performed another domino transplant
Jan. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Recipients of a liver from an amyloidosis patient risk
eventually developing symptoms of the disease, ``but it pales in
significance compared to the risk of dying while waiting,'' said
Dr. David Lewis, director of the Lahey liver-transplant program,
who headed the surgical team.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told us he would never get to the top of the list''
because he was so far down, Clarke's wife, Mary, said. ``This was
his chance _ and he took it.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone in Clarke's situation potentially could receive a piece
of a liver from a living donor, but Lewis said there was no such
donor available for Clarke.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line in the domino transplant: two patients would be
aided with just one new cadaver liver. Livers, like most solid
organs, are in desperately short supply for transplants.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said about 35 domino transplants have been done, most of
them in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, there was no treatment for amyloidosis patients,
who typically begin having symptoms in middle age, said Dr. Martha
Skinner, who heads the amyloidosis clinic at Boston Medical Center,
one of the largest such clinics. Lewis performed the first liver
transplant for an amyloidosis patient (it was not a domino
transplant) in 1992, while at the New England Deaconess Hospital,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Striking about 1 in 100,000 people, familial amyloidosis is
caused by a mutation that causes the liver to make the protein
transthyretin. Over many years, the protein becomes deposited in
body tissues and leads to numbness and tingling in the extremities,
severe constipation and diarrhea, and electrical irregularities in
the heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible disorder,'' Skinner said. When a patient
receives a normal liver, she said, ``you stop the abnormal protein
deposit, and it changes the whole course of events.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Lewis who first proposed the domino transplant strategy.
``The thing that struck us,'' he said, was in removing the livers
of amyloidosis patients prior to implanting a donor organ, ``it was
eerie taking out a normal-looking liver.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of discarding it, Lewis said, it would make sense to
offer to someone unlikely to get any liver at all _ an older person
who had not risen very far on the waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   The logistics of the recent liver swap were formidable, Lewis
said. For starters, a surgical team had to go to the undisclosed
hospital where permission had been given for a brain-dead patient
to donate the liver and other organs. The removal of those organs
took two or three hours in the middle of the night, Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning at 8 a.m., Lewis led a team that began carefully
removing Pereira's liver, a process that needed ``a little extra
attention'' because the organ was to be reused.
</P>
<P>
   Ethically, Lewis said, the surgeons' first priority was to
ensure that Pereira's transplant was going normally. When her liver
was out and packed in ice and the cadaver liver was being placed in
Pereira, Dr. Roger Evans, another team member, began removing
Clarke's liver in an adjoining operating room.
</P>
<P>
   After he finished transplanting Pereira's new liver, Lewis
assisted Evans in implanting her old liver into Clarke. The
marathon surgery went into the early evening. ``It was a long
day,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Because it was the New Year's weekend, when there normally is
little elective surgery, many beds were empty. Several physicians
were away, and many nurses and other staff employees were taking
the day off.
</P>
<P>
   But key people volunteered to come in, and such critical
services as anesthesia and blood banking were taken care of.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people went the extra mile on January 1,'' Lewis
said. And the procedure, he added, ``couldn't have gone better. We
were delighted.''

<P>
   HONG KONG _ It was hardly Paris, but Shanghai played a part in
the brief, intense courtship between America Online and Time
Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Case, the chairman of America Online, attended a Fortune
magazine conference there in October, during which he met and
mingled with Time Warner's top executives, including Gerald Levin
and Ted Turner. Later, the executives traveled to Beijing for the
50th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
A Time Warner executive who was there recalls a teasing exchange
between Case and Turner, when the two found themselves stranded in
the rain outside the Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ted, your big, merged company isn't getting you off the
steps,'' Case shouted to Turner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve,'' he replied, ``your billions ain't getting you
anywhere either.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear, even after America Online's extraordinary bid
for Time Warner, that this huge merged company will be able to get
off the steps in China _ or elsewhere in Asia. As in Europe, where
America Online has built a valuable regional franchise through its
partnership with Bertelsmann AG, the Internet in Asia remains a
fractured business with few large competitors and virtually none
that cross national boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL and Time Warner have tremendous critical mass in the
United States and, through AOL and Compuserve, in Europe as well,''
said Michael Wolf, the partner in charge of the media practice at
Booz Allen &AMP; Hamilton in New York. ``But to a large extent, Asia is
up for grabs.''
</P>
<P>
   America Online operates an online service in Japan and recently
started one in Hong Kong. But it has yet to enter the Chinese
mainland, where Yahoo, the Internet portal service, is one of the
only major American Internet companies to have established a
foothold. Time Warner distributes movies and music in China, as
well as CNN and Time magazine, when they are not banned by the
Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   But Time Warner, like most other American media companies, has
not been able to make deep inroads into China because of barriers
ranging from piracy and onerous regulations to political pressure.
The proposed merger will not eliminate those hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said that America Online would benefit more from a
merger than Time Warner because its credibility would be burnished
in the eyes of the Chinese government. Although Beijing recently
indicated, after months of equivocation, that it would allow
foreign companies to invest in the Internet, the government seems
likely to pick and choose among potential entrants. Analysts said
America Online's odds of receiving favorable treatment would be
higher if it tied up with a media giant like Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   ``CNN and Ted Turner will open doors for this company
politically, allowing it to do things that other companies may not
be able to,'' Wolf said.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Lippey, chief executive of Tokai Asia, a hedge fund in
Hong Kong, said, ``The merger gives AOL international credibility.
Time Warner is a good, old-fashioned multinational.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the merged company's prospects in Asia are uncertain,
news of the huge deal reverberated through the region, prompting
talk of more mergers and strategic alliances involving Asian
companies. Shares of local media companies and Internet access
providers soared on Tuesday, though most fell back Wednesday as the
initial giddiness over the announcement subsided.
</P>
<P>
   That reality check may reflect some basic truths about Asia.
Lehman Brothers noted in a report that the ownership of many Asian
media companies was concentrated in the hands of one or two large
investors. That would make large combinations like AOL-Time Warner
unlikely, at least in the short-term.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Cultural, linguistic and regulatory differences among Asian
countries also militate against the creation of pan-Asian
companies. Two decades after CNN was founded in the United States,
Star TV, which is the satellite television service, remains the
only genuinely regional media service based in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at Japan, there are some wonderful media
companies, but very little of their material sees the light of day
outside Japan,'' said Alexander Arena, the group managing director
of Pacific Century Cyberworks, a Hong Kong company that is
designing a satellite-delivered Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts and stock pickers were quick to draw up lists of
Asian companies they contended would benefit from the changes
uncorked by America Online and Time Warner. Leading the list were
obvious candidates like Sony, the Japanese electronics giant, and
less obvious ones like TVB, a Hong Kong television broadcaster that
owns the world's largest library of Chinese-language programming.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that any company aspiring to deliver information
and entertainment to subscribers via high-capacity wires would also
benefit. Among the Asian players in this ``broadband'' business are
Korea Thrunet and Pacific Century Cyberworks of Hong Kong. Hong
Kong's dominant local phone company, Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT, may also
come into favor because of its recent alliance with Star TV, in
which the two plan to offer television programming to the phone
company's customers.
</P>
<P>
   For all the excitement, Asia's reaction to the AOL-Time Warner
has had an unfocused quality. Experts said that reflected the
Internet's relative lack of the development here, which makes
picking winners and predicting the future even more futile than in
the United States. ``It's a simple question of supply and demand,''
Lippey said. ``There aren't that many quality Internet companies in
Asia.''

BELICHICK CONTRACT GRIEVANCE IN NFL CHIEF'S HANDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Seven hours of testimony in a meeting room on the
38th floor of 4 Times Square did not bring Bill Belichick to the
Patriots again. At least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   NFL spokeswoman Leslie Hammond said commissioner Paul Tagliabue
would not rule on the validity of Belichick's New York Jets
contract until Monday at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony from Belichick's attorneys and by the Jets was given
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets received an extension to present more testimony Friday,
but declined, leaving the matter in Tagliabue's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue did attend some of the hearing at the law offices of
Skadden, Arps, arriving at 9:45 a.m. and leaving shortly before
noon. The league's lead counsel, Jeff Pash, heard the testimony of
the witnesses brought forth by the Belichick legal team of Jeffrey
Kessler and Neil Cornrich. Kessler called Belichick and Jets
offensive coordinator Charlie Weis, who was deposed as a hostile
witness.
</P>
<P>
   New York's director of football operations Bill Parcells spoke
on behalf of the Jets, his session lasting about a half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently Weis knew something that would help Belichick's case,
though Kessler wouldn't comment on why he was called.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells also left the building before noon, sporting a scowl
either directed at the waiting media waiting for him or because of
the questioning he received from Kessler.
</P>
<P>
   Kessler is playing hardball with the league, threatening to take
the matter to federal court on an antitrust violation if the league
does not let Belichick out of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made it very clear we believe that the league doesn't have
any power or authority to restrict Coach Belichick, that it would
be a violation of the antitrust laws to do so,'' Kessler said. We
explained why that was, in terms of the state of the record and
with respect to the law that applies here. We hope that the league
will come to the same conclusion and that therefore further action
won't be necessary.'' Kessler, who has been involved in player
union matters with the NBA, contends the league ``cannot stop other
teams from making offers to or hiring Belichick if they would like.
We think the law is very clear. If the league were not to agree
with us we would take this further.''
</P>
<P>
   Kessler said on the issue of compensation for Belichick,
``People are not property. If you have to change and move to your
job, a court does not have the power to enter an injunction to
restrict you, neither can the commissioner of the NFL. There's no
compensation attached to you. There's no collective bargaining
agreement. These are not players, these are coaches. It's a
completely different set of circumstances when it's not bargained
for as part of a union.''
</P>
<P>
   Kessler contends Belichick can't go back to work for the Jets
because the Jets ``have conceded'' that they no longer want
Belichick's services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the law is very clear that in these circumstances,
a court could not and would not prevent an employee from going
elsewhere essentially because you'd be depriving him of his
livelihood. He cannot go back to work for the Jets,'' added
Kessler. ``There is no other place in the NFL he can go if the
league blocks him. The courts have been very clear that is not
permitted.''
</P>
<P>
   Kessler said he presented other arguments in addition to the
antitrust issue, but was not willing to specify.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick emerged from the elevator with his legal team flanking
him. Dressed in a grey overcoat, suit and tie, the former Patriots
assistant coach said, ``I appreciate the opportunity to state our
case before the NFL and I hope for a quick resolution. That's
really all I can say at this point. Any other questions will have
to be referred to Jeff.'' Jets president Steve Gutman was also in
the meeting room, but issued a ``no comment'' through spokesman
Frank Ramos.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets contend they have a binding contract with Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   Boston attorney Harry Manion, who has represented sports teams
such as the NHL's Pittsburgh Penguins and also has been involved in
antitrust cases in the past, thinks Belichick is getting poor
advice from Kessler.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's (Kessler) silly enough to file an antitrust case on
this matter he'll be bounced out federal court in two shakes,''
said Manion. ``From the league's standpoint I would put no weight
on this threat. It's simply about an assistant coach who signed a
contract and now he's trying to get out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   This is leading to a resolution in which Belichick would be
allowed to become the coach and general manager of the Patriots if
the Jets receive compensation. For now, Kessler does not sound like
a man who is going to accept compensation as a solution.

   Settlement to Help A Tobacco Region &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because of the $206 billion legal settlement that 46 states
reached with the tobacco industry in 1998, a North Carolina
foundation will be able to provide help to areas damaged by
Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit organization, Golden LEAF, for Long-term Economic
Advancement Fund, could begin making grants as early as late spring
in regions of the state tied to tobacco, including parts of eastern
North Carolina heavily damaged by the hurricane last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of these dollars is to bring about some action to
immediately relieve that suffering, and that's what we're going to
do, as promptly as we can,'' said William Friday, the retired
president of the University of North Carolina system who is
chairman of the foundation's board.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the foundation has received $29.3 million from the
settlement. It expects to receive nearly $4.6 billion through 2025.

   Telecommuting in the Dark &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Americans who work from home might well be puzzled. At the
beginning of the year, the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration gave a strong signal that telecommuters should
expect to be covered by the same safety standards that applied in
their companies' offices.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA wrote what it called an advisory letter to CSC Credit
Services, a unit of the Computer Sciences Corp., that had sought
advice about moving some of its executives into home offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ensuring safe and healthful working conditions for the
employee should be a precondition for any home-based work
assignments,'' OSHA said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
   But after the contents of the letter became public, the agency
stressed that there was no change in government policy and that it
would take no new action.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the letter set off a round of criticism from
corporations and lawmakers. A few days later, the agency rescinded
the advisory.
</P>
<P>
   Back at home, meanwhile, telecommuters, who have surged in
number over the last decade, are feeling a bit, well, ignored. In a
survey by the American Management Association, only 7 percent of
1,265 executives of the group's member organizations said their
companies offered employees training to work outside the normal
office environment.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that fewer than half of executives who
telecommute were given necessary equipment. About half reported
that they lacked adequate technical support.

 &HT;    Redeeming the future: Grandparents feel need to lead
 &HT;    By Clay Lambert
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Grandparents _ once considered the
silver-haired sages of the rocking chair _ are no longer content to
spoil, pamper and regale their grandchildren with tales of times
gone by. Now they want to teach them a thing or two while they're
at it.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, the lessons they hope to impart may hint at what
they consider failures in the upbringing of their own children, a
recent study shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``My children do a beautiful job,'' said Ida Brodney, a
grandmother living in Delray Beach. ``But I'm teaching my grandson
to save.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grew up in the Depression,'' she said, pointing to her
husband, George. ``Our children don't know the meaning of a
dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   That isn't all the Brodneys and their contemporaries think their
children don't know a thing about. The study released last week by
the AARP suggests that grandparents feel they have to teach morals,
ambition and religion to their grandkids _ if they want the
children to pick up those qualities at all.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of the relationship between grandparent and
grandchild comes into sharp relief today as the U.S. Supreme Court
considers what may be a landmark case.
</P>
<P>
   Troxel vs. Glanville pits the mother of two girls against the
parents of their father, who committed suicide years earlier. The
grandparents successfully petitioned a lower court for visitation
rights, but the Washington state supreme court overruled that
decision in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Today, all 50 states include some provision for grandparent
visitation rights. Thirty states allow grandparents to petition for
visitation even if the parents are married and both oppose the
visits. The law is catching up to a wrinkled, and presumably
slower, America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The three-generation family never really existed,'' said Karen
Pyke, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ```The Waltons' was a bit of a myth,'' she said of television's
beloved mountainside clan.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the good old days in which grandparents guided family
values is likely to be more true now than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty million Americans _ nearly a third of the population _ are
now grandparents, according to Roper Starch Worldwide, a research
group. The proportion of Americans who are grandparents is growing
because we are living longer. In 1900, Americans could expect to
die at the age of 46; by 1985, women were living an average of 80
years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the AARP study reveals that grandparents are seeing
their grandchildren more than many imagined. More than 80 percent
reported interacting with grandkids at least once in the last month
and 44 percent said they saw the children in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   Are children like Natalie and Isabelle Troxel _ the preteens at
the center of this week's Supreme Court debate _ any better off for
all this time spent with grandma and grandpa?
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly do not know,'' answered Gretchen Straw, associate
research director for AARP.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been some small studies, but nothing that would
make that clear,'' added Margaret Hollidge, director of the AARP's
Grandparent Information Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we do know is that children do better when they are
surrounded by love and the earlier the better,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Children are increasingly likely to get most of their loving
from grandparents, who also are raising their grandchildren in
record numbers. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, 1.4
million children are living in grandparents' homes without either
parent present. That is up 75 percent since 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say that may be why grandparents list morals,
ambition and religion as their top priorities, well ahead of
spoiling their grandchildren rotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Grandparents) have lived in a world that has changed
rapidly,'' Pyke said, ``and they are concerned about the world that
their grandkids will live in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Grandparents want to see their values continue,'' said Amelia
Rose, a facilitator for the Children's Services Council of Palm
Beach County and chairman of the year-old Coalition for
Grandparents Raising Grandchildren. ``Today's parents don't have
time to pay attention to values that their own parents find very
important.''
</P>
<P>
   The AARP study _ which focused on 823 grandparents interviewed
in the fall of 1998 _ also revealed that grandparents' values
differed along racial lines. Despite the fact that their education
and income levels were similar, white grandparents were most likely
to list morals as the most important value to impart to
grandchildren, while black grandparents answered ``ambition'' in
response to the same question.
</P>
<P>
   The black grandparents also were more likely than whites to
consider themselves important advisers and to pass their hobbies
and interests on to grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to know what that means,'' Straw said. ``I think
African-Americans certainly do value economic well-being. These
grandparents are the children of segregation who have personally
experienced problems getting ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Edith Bush of West Palm Beach agreed. She is black and a
68-year-old grandmother of two as well as a member of the Palm
Beach County Partnership for Aging.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black families know it will be a struggle,'' she said. ``If we
all had the same things to begin with, we would all want the same
things for our grandkids.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this means that grandparents value anything more than
the love of their grandchildren. And there is ample evidence in toy
chests across America that grandma and grandpa remain an easy mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give my grandchildren anything they want,'' said Matty
Kombert of Boynton Beach, proud grandmother to 10, mostly living in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want Pokemon?'' Kombart asked. ``Then Pokemon goes to New
York.''

 &HT;    Course offers guidance on getting ready for marriage
 &HT;    By Loretta Grantham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ If you're hankering for a husband _ we
mean, in an I-do-or-die sort of way _ forget your little black
book. Dig out your checkbook instead.
</P>
<P>
   Because for $9,600, a New York psychotherapist will nurture you
through nuptial boot camp, preparing you for the man of your
dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Bad news is, he ain't included. But when he does show up, you'll
be ready (complete with La-Z-Boy and tidy fridge).
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at what women spend on face lifts, liposuction, cosmetics
and fitness,'' says Marilyn Graman, whose six-month course,
``Marriage Works: A Step-by-Step Intensive Program Designed to Lead
you Down the Aisle,'' begins Feb. 18 at her Manhattan office. (The
next class starts in September.)
</P>
<P>
   ``So even though women may be ready on the outside, they may not
be ready on the inside. Perhaps there are unresolved issues from
old love affairs. Or maybe they're not ready to give up their
singlehood.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these things aren't dealt with, a woman can't make progress
toward marriage no matter how much she spends on her exterior.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight women (no boys allowed!) have enrolled for 276 hours of
one-on-one counseling, group therapy, image consulting, relaxation
techniques and house calls.
</P>
<P>
   For example, during the ``Making Space for Him'' session, an
interior designer visits each student's home to determine
``man-readiness.''
</P>
<P>
   The expert ``will address issues of color, furniture placement,
energy-flow decoration and more to help create the environment that
both soothes and expresses what you are all about,'' a course
description reads.
</P>
<P>
   Advises Graman: ``There are ways to make a man feel more at
home. Have a comfortable place for him to sit and something growing
so he can see that life can be given here.''
</P>
<P>
   Just make sure it's not growing in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leftovers show you don't have a keen interest in your
environment,'' she warns.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 13 hours of the seminar are devoted to ``Being a
Goddess.''
</P>
<P>
   An artist-healer ``will show you how to glow from within, be
more calm, and breathe correctly to take in any situation more
fully and stay clear so you can make the best choices.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This leads to being more comfortable in the presence of a
husband,'' course literature says. ``A rose is itself, and a bee
comes.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Graman: ``Being a goddess isn't how you look. It has
everything to do with self-respect, about the ability to be very
soft without letting anyone step on you.''
</P>
<P>
   There's even a four-hour class on learning how to graciously
receive ``all the wonderful gifts, tokens and special times that
men are wanting to give.''
</P>
<P>
   And finally, ``Marriage Works'' includes a couple of parties
(boys allowed!) just before graduation day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We provide an opportunity for interaction, but that's not our
focus,'' the counselor says. ``We're here to get women ready. Women
who've found satisfaction elsewhere, but who look at their watch
and realize they don't have the husband and family they thought
they would.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're used to getting results in their professional lives,
and now, they want as much success outside the office.''

 &HT;    Getting happily hitched: 10 things to keep in mind
 &HT;    By Loretta Grantham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Marilyn Graman, a New York
psychotherapist who specializes in relationships, says that
altar-seeking women should remember:
</P>
<P>
   1) You deserve a mate _ if that's indeed what you want.
</P>
<P>
   2) He shouldn't be like the last guy who didn't work out. If he
is, discover why you chose ``him'' again, and stop the pattern.
</P>
<P>
   3) Uncover hidden conversations within yourself that might be
pushing love away. Do you secretly think you're unworthy of
affection?
</P>
<P>
   4) Open your heart to the man in your life. Let yourself feel.
</P>
<P>
   5) Both of you will make mistakes. Lighten up.
</P>
<P>
   6) Neither of you wants to be criticized, but men can be
especially sensitive _ even if they don't show it.
</P>
<P>
   7) Forget all the male-bashing you've heard over the years. Give
him a fair shot.
</P>
<P>
   8) Before you pick a mate, decide exactly what you want from
him. Be specific. Maybe you don't need him around every day to feel
secure. Or maybe you do. Maybe you need to receive flowers
occasionally to feel special. Or maybe you're allergic to them.
</P>
<P>
   9) He's not your parent even if you get him to behave that way
sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   10) Your Mr. Right wants you to be happy. Let him do what it
takes to make you feel that way.
</P>
<P>
   And 10 things women wish men knew 1) Tell her you love her _
often.
</P>
<P>
   2) You're important to her, and don't make her feel like she has
to hide that.
</P>
<P>
   3) Keep your promises because her heart is easily broken.
</P>
<P>
   4) Don't take her for granted. Appreciate how she nurtures you.
</P>
<P>
   5) Love her for who she is, not how she looks.
</P>
<P>
   6) She was trained to make you the center of her life _ and
she's trying to recover. Be patient.
</P>
<P>
   7) She needs space, too.
</P>
<P>
   8) You can listen without trying to help because that does help.
</P>
<P>
   9) She's not your parent even if you get her to behave that way
sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   10) Compliment her, and reassure her that she's in your
thoughts.

IN DEAL WITH TV NETWORKS, U.S. DRUG OFFICE IS REVIEWING SCRIPTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By MARC LACEY with BILL CARTER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Over the past two years, the White House has
reviewed some scripts and advance footage of such television shows
as ``ER'' and ``Beverly Hills 90210'' under a little-known
financial agreement with the networks that encourages them to
include antidrug messages in the plots of programs.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the arrangement, White House drug policy officials
scrutinized in advance more than 100 episodes on all the major
networks. If the government signs off on a particular show, the
networks receive credit that reduces the number of costly public
service announcements they are forced by law to air.
</P>
<P>
   The government officials, in the White House Office of National
Drug Control Policy, said they made some programming suggestions to
the networks. But television executives, who are participating in
the effort voluntarily with an eye on the bottom line, insist that
they never gave control of the content of their shows to the
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``NBC has never ceded creative control of any of our programs''
to the drug policy office or any other department of government,
said Rosalyn Weinman, the executive vice president of content
policy for NBC. The other networks issued similar statements.
</P>
<P>
   But various networks and television studio executives said they
did look for episodes that might satisfy the interests of the drug
office.
</P>
<P>
   The practice surfaced on Thursday in a critical report on Salon,
an Internet magazine, that labeled the practice ``prime-time
propaganda.'' Although not widely known, the programming effort had
been outlined by Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, director of drug policy
office, during a Congressional hearing last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Jay Schwartzman, president of the Media Access Project, a
public interest law firm, told Salon, ``This is the most craven
thing I've ever heard of yet. To turn over content control to the
federal government for a modest price is an outrageous abandonment
of the First Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the program, government officials get an advance look at
whatever shows the networks want to submit and an opportunity to
make the case that antidrug messages be inserted. Occasionally, the
drug policy office might suggest that a scene be changed or a line
rewritten to show characters turning down marijuana or ruining
their lives through cocaine, said Alan Levitt, an official in the
drug policy office who helped create the program. In the vast
majority of cases, he said, no suggestions are made at all.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the drug policy office defended the arrangement
as an effective way of spreading antidrug messages to young people
without infringing on the creative process. Drug use among youth
has dropped by 15 percent in the last year, said drug policy office
officials, crediting both a government advertising blitz and
antidrug programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we plead guilty to using every lawful means of saving
America's children,'' said Bob Weiner, a spokesman for the drug
office. ``But we don't interfere in the creative process. We don't
say they can't run anything. We don't tell them what to say or not
to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., whose appropriations subcommittee funds
the drug policy office, said he approves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new program,'' Kolbe said. ``We're going to watch it
closely. Certainly some questions have been raised about it. But we
want to get the message out to young people.''
</P>
<P>
   Levitt said all the major networks have participated in the
arrangement, saving in excess of $20 million in advertising costs.
Although Levitt listed numerous shows that had been reviewed by his
office _ from ``ER'' to ``Touched by an Angel'' to the ``Cosby
Show'' _ he declined to provide the complete list.
</P>
<P>
   Congress in 1997 financed a huge antidrug advertising campaign
that required that media outlets match any advertising time
purchased by the federal government with an equal amount of public
service time. That mandate essentially gives the drug office and
other government agencies the ability to purchase ads at half
price.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Under the programming deal worked out by the drug office,
networks can reduce the amount of ad time they are required to
provide to the government by airing antidrug shows. The networks
can then sell air time that would have gone to the government for
half price to regular advertisers for full price.
</P>
<P>
   Every network issued statements asserting that they have never
ceded any control over their content to any governmental office.
</P>
<P>
   But every network but one agreed they had sent either final
drafts of scripts or tapes of completed shows to the advertising
agency representing the drug office, seeking credit from the
government.
</P>
<P>
   The one exception was the new and smaller network, WB, which
conceded that it had submitted scripts in progress from ``Smart
Guy'' and ``The Wayans Brothers.'' Both shows were doing episodes
on the theme of drug use and both altered their scripts as a result
of suggestions by government experts.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Kellner, the chief executive of WB, said the network's
motivation was to ``try to find expertise'' that would help make
the episodes accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We submitted the scripts to get their input and make sure we
were handling the stories in the most responsible way,'' Kellner
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not editing the scripts. They may say something like,
`This will only work in the story if the person is truly
inebriated.'''
</P>
<P>
   Like several other producers whose shows were used to help
generate network credits, John Tinker, who produced the medical
drama ``Chicago Hope,'' never knew his show was being sent to the
government. ``I would certainly have liked to know about it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said McCaffrey was traveling and not available for comment
on Thursday. At a hearing in October before a House appropriations
subcommittee, McCaffrey outlined the complicated system of credits.
</P>
<P>
   ``An on-strategy storyline that is the main plot of a half-hour
show can be valued at three 30-second ads,'' he said. ``If there is
an end-tag with an 800 number or more information at the end of a
half-hour show, it is valued at an additional 15-second ad. A main
storyline is an hour-long prime-time show is valued at five
30-second ads, while such a storyline in a one-hour daytime show is
valued at four 30-second ads.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey discussed the complexities of getting the right
message across.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize that you cannot `shoehorn' a drug message in a
script where it does not belong,'' he testified. ``It must appear
organically.'' He added: ``Sometimes only a one-second frown or
wave of the hand when someone is offered marijuana is all that is
needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Rich Hamilton, an advertising executive who helped create the
arrangement, said the program does not force networks to offer
antidrug shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd say to a television network: `You're already doing this
and it's great you're doing this,''' said Hamilton, chief executive
for the North America operations of Zenith Media Services in New
York. ``And if you're planning, once our paid campaign begins, to
continue this, send us the script and we will not rule out giving
you credits for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Until a year ago, Zenith was responsible for media planning and
buying for the drug-control policy office's paid advertising
initiative. Zenith developed schedules of when and where the
commercials were to run and then purchased the commercial time.
Zenith lost the account in January 1999 to Ogilvy &AMP; Mather
Worldwide in New York, a unit of the WPP Group.

ANTIDRUG CONTENT IN TV SCRIPTS ALLEGEDLY EARNED MILLIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ AND DON AUCOIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Prime-time television's role as a combatant in the war on drugs
is being highlighted by a story alleging that broadcasters reaped
financial gain by including antidrug messages in prime-time
programs as part of an arrangement with the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   According to the online magazine Salon, the six broadcast
networks _ NBC, ABC, CBS, Fox, WB, and UPN _ have earned nearly $25
million from a complex advertising deal under which government
officials and their ``contractors'' approved and sometimes changed
scripts ``to conform with the government's antidrug messages.''
</P>
<P>
   All the networks _ except the WB network, which had no immediate
comment to The Boston Globe _ denied that scripts or program
content had been altered to accommodate the government. In a
typical response, Rosalyn Weinman, NBC executive vice president of
broadcast content policy, said the network ``never ceded content
control of any of our programming'' to the government and ``at no
time did NBC turn over scripts for approval.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Bob Weiner, a spokesman for federal drug czar Barry
McCaffrey, insisted that ``We don't clear scripts.''
</P>
<P>
   However, some networks did gain financially by airing programs
with antidrug messages that met the approval of the White House
Office of National Drug Control Policy. Certain antidrug themes
within entertainment programs qualified as virtual public service
announcements, allowing the networks to reclaim antidrug
advertising time and sell it at higher rates.
</P>
<P>
   According to the online magazine, episodes of such programs as
NBC's ``ER,'' ABC's ``The Practice,'' and CBS's ``Cosby'' were
``assigned a monetary value by the drug czar's office and its two
ad buyers.'' The Associated Press reported that the WB network
altered an episode of ``The Smart Guy'' to make drug-using teens
look like ``losers'' after a government review.
</P>
<P>
   Weiner said that more than 100 programs last year did receive
credit for antidrug messages, and that roughly a dozen were
rejected. But he insisted that those shows were only reviewed after
they were completed. Another two dozen shows voluntarily approached
the drug office for technical script advice on how to accurately
depict drug abuse, but did not accrue any financial benefits for
doing so, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law mandates that we have entertainment industry
collaboration to fashion antidrug messages in television
programming,'' he said. ``We plead guilty to using every lawful
means to save the lives of America's children.''
</P>
<P>
   But the extent of television's role in that crusade is at the
heart of the explosive charges in Salon. If the government was
actually involved in crafting antidrug story lines for television
shows' ``that's really frightening,'' said Robert J. Thompson, of
Syracuse University's Center for the Study of Popular Television.
``The most fundamental issue here is that short of debates and
political advertising, has the federal government got any business
using the television airwaves in that fashion?''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine reported that the arrangement began two years ago
when Congress approved $1 billion to buy antidrug commercials on
network television, but only if the ad time was sold to the
government at half-price. The magazine said that the the Office of
National Drug Control Policy offered to relinquish some of that
cut-rate commercial time back to the networks ``in return for
getting anti-drug motifs incorporated within specific prime-time
shows.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With the deal in place, government officials and their
contractors began approving, and in some cases altering, the
scripts of shows before they were aired to conform with the
government's anti-drug message,'' according to Salon.
</P>
<P>
   On that point, the networks delivered unequivocal denials. ``At
no point has the independence or the creative integrity of our
programming been compromised,'' said CBS spokesman Dana McClintock.
Fox issued a statement that said that while the network ``is proud
of its work with ONDCP and remains committed to working with the
office in promoting its antidrug efforts. ... At no time has the
ONDCP either sought or been granted creative control over Fox
program content.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC spokeswoman Julie Hoover said the network ``never submitted
scripts ahead of time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This has had no impact whatsoever on UPN programming, nor has
UPN actively requested any of our writers or producers to provide
storylines for ONDCP sponsorship,'' said UPN spokesman Paul
McGuire.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Forbes, the New York freelancer who wrote the article for
Salon magazine, said ``we stand by the story 1000 percent. They
(the networks) are running as fast as they can. They're lying
through their teeth.''

 &HT;    Author chronicles Florida art history in new book
 &HT;    By Gary Schwan
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEQUESTA, Fla. _ Maybelle Mann once told a New York art dealer
that she was planning a book on Florida art. ``What's it going to
be,'' he sneered, ``a pamphlet?''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later, the Tequesta historian has the answer: ``No,
a book.''
</P>
<P>
   Her overview of the state's art, titled ``Art in Florida
1564-1945,'' has just been published by Sarasota's Pineapple Press.
An exhibition of the same name runs Saturday through April 9 at the
Florida History Center &AMP; Museum in Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   The show contains roughly 50 paintings, drawings, prints and
photographs. The earliest are two prints by the first European
artist to set foot in Florida, the Frenchman Jacques LeMoyne, who
arrived in 1564 at what is today St. Augustine. An engraving of one
of his watercolors depicts promenading royalty of the Timucuan
tribe: ``The King and Queen Take a Walk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I speak to people who live in Florida who still don't think
there is such a thing'' as Florida art, said Mann, who has also
written books on the 19th-century American Art Union and painter
William Launt Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, they're right, she said _ at least if you're
talking pre-1945. Like nearly everyone else, the artists who worked
here came from somewhere else and usually had well-established
careers. ``Mainly, they were snowbirds. They came for the climate''
and were struck by the ``exotic'' state, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, there was no such thing as a Florida regional style or
subject matter. ``For example, there is very little marine art like
you find in New England, which I think is surprising considering
all the boats on the water,'' Mann said.
</P>
<P>
   MUSEUM VIEWS ART AS HISTORY
</P>
<P>
   Mann said the reason there has been no definitive study of
Florida art is because it has only recently been taken seriously as
a subject. More than 40 collectors and institutions contributed
work to the show, headed by Dan McKenna, a DeLand private
collector. ``He once had a museum of Florida art in St. Augustine,
but nobody came,'' Mann said.
</P>
<P>
   Mann said the history center became interested in the show after
board member Alan Holmes read her book in manuscript form.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first exhibition of this magnitude for the
museum,'' said its new interim executive director, George Blanck.
``The show has more to do with the history of Florida itself, as
seen through its art. We don't see ourselves becoming an art
exhibiting institution, per se. But you can portray history in any
number of ways, and art is certainly one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The state has attracted a roster of top-notch artists. A list of
332 names appears in the book, including that of John James
Audubon, who visited Key West in 1832. His aquatint ``Great White
Heron'' is in the show.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the noted 19th-century landscape painters George
Inness and Martin Johnson Heade, who lived in St. Augustine thanks
to the patronage of railroad mogul Henry Morrison Flagler. Inness
worked in Florida between 1890 and 1894, settling in Tarpon
Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Inness' oil ``The Road to Tarpon Springs, Florida,'' also called
``Moonlight,'' is in the show. So is Heade's oil ``St. Johns
River,'' painted sometime between 1890 and 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Winslow Homer and John Singer Sargent also visited the state.
Sargent arrived in Miami in 1917 at the invitation of James
Deering, the industrialist whose home is now the Vizcaya Museum. He
created several watercolors. Homer came to Key West in 1886 and
also painted along the St. Johns River in northeast Florida.
(Neither artist is represented in the exhibition.)
</P>
<P>
   Notable artists who are include Milton Avery, who worked in
Coral Gables, and Frederick Frieseke, an American who painted based
on memories of his childhood in Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   No painter of similar stature worked in Palm Beach, although the
island attracted a host of artists in the prewar years. Many were
attracted by society patronage; others came to teach at the Norton
Museum of Art's former art school, including painter Adolph Dehn
and the respected watercolorist Eliot O'Hara. Dehn has a Key West
beach scene in the show. O'Hara is represented by a 1942 watercolor
depicting a Palm Beach via off Worth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   CHICKEN ARTIST STAYED A WHILE
</P>
<P>
   The O'Hara picture is the only local work on view, although
Mann's book dutifully lists a host of artists who worked in this
area.
</P>
<P>
   They include Jane Peterson, Laura Woodward, Anthony Thieme, the
noted Spanish muralist Jose Maria Sert, who decorated island
houses, and Ben Austrian, who was known as the ``Landseer of
Chickens,'' referring to the British artist Henry Landseer, noted
for his animal pictures. While living in Palm Beach, Austria
painted island scenes, not chickens.
</P>
<P>
   Mann also discusses groups such as the Palm Beach County Art
Club and the Association for Artists. Their exhibitions attracted
work by such artists as Theodore Robinson and Maurice Prendergast.
</P>
<P>
   But American paintings were a hard sell, Mann said. ``They
weren't very popular with the rich because European paintings were
what they bought in the '20s,'' Mann said. ``That didn't change
until World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann, 84, said her book represents 20 years of off and on
research. Born in Illinois, she grew up in New York. She returned
to college as an adult and ``kept on getting degrees,'' including a
Ph.D. in American civilization from New York University. She said
she ``got tired of reading about the Civil War'' and turned her
attention to art history. She has always worked privately.
</P>
<P>
   Mann and her husband, Alvin Lloyd, a retired businessman, have
lived in Tequesta for 22 years. Like many of the artists she writes
about, the reason she came to Florida was simple:
</P>
<P>
   ``We got out of the car just after crossing the state line, and
the air was balmy. You could feel a difference _ or imagined you
could. We were hooked.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann said she's probably overlooked a few artists who've worked
in the state. ``Now that the book is published, they'll probably
come out of the woodwork like mad.''

HIT BY RISING COSTS, UAL CORP. WARNS OF EARNINGS SLUMP 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Faced with rising labor and fuel costs, UAL Corp., the parent
company of United Airlines, said Thursday that its earnings this
year were likely to be as much as 28 percent below expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement prompted a huge selloff of airline stocks.
UAL's shares plunged 13 percent, or $9.875, to $64.875. Shares of
AMR, the parent of American Airlines, dropped 6.5 percent, or
$4.6875, to $60.25. Delta Air Lines stock fell 4.2 percent, or
$2.1875, to $49.8125.
</P>
<P>
   UAL, which is based in Chicago, said it expected earnings this
year of $7 to $9 a share, well below the $9.82 consensus estimate
from analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   United Airlines, the world's largest carrier, is being plagued
by troubles that are common to the industry and by others that are
singular to its operation. Jet fuel prices increased about 24
percent last year and United predicted further jumps this year.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the carnage, several of United's unions were demanding
large wage increases, in part to keep up with competitors and to
replace money generated from the company's expiring stock ownership
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``UAL gave a very sobering message yesterday,'' said Kevin
Murphy, an airlines analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``No
airline outperforms when you're negotiating with labor. If United
gives big wage boosts to its pilots and mechanics, the other
carriers may have to catch up.''
</P>
<P>
   The amount of United's cost increases caught some analysts by
surprise. Candace Browning, an airlines analyst for Merrill Lynch,
had estimated United's wages would increase $400 million this year,
but raised the amount to $780 million after UAL's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   UAL had begun a program in 1994 to give its employees stock
instead of wage increases. The program is expected to be
discontinued this spring, leaving many UAL employees anxious about
salary increases.
</P>
<P>
   Wage increases from union pressure are common in the airline
industry, but much of United's dispute is expected to come from the
company's pilots, whose contract expires in April. A particularly
contentious issue will be the salary of pilots who fly Boeing 777s,
a twin-engine plane that seats about 275 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's pilots recently negotiated a base wage of $265 an hour
to fly the 777, which brings their base pay on that plane to about
$240,000 annually. Analysts believe that United's pilots, who trail
Delta's, may seek to match or top that rate. The problem is that
United is expected to have 48 of the Boeing 777s in its fleet this
year, compared with about 11 for Delta, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   But labor was only one of UAL's woes. The company also said that
it expected the average price of jet fuel to be 71 cents a gallon
this year, 6 cents above what most analysts had projected. The
price of jet fuel had averaged about 62 cents a gallon during the
second half of last year, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We disagree with United's estimate of the fuel price,'' said
Samuel Buttrick, an airlines analyst with PaineWebber. ``We think
the price will be around 65 cents per gallon. But if United's
assessment is correct, then that will be a factor that will affect
the entire industry.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of its performance projection for 2000, UAL said it
expected revenue growth in Latin America, the Pacific and North
America. The company said that its revenue would increase 2 percent
to 4 percent this year, but that would be overshadowed by a 6
percent rise in costs.

ANTIDRUG CONTENT IN TV SCRIPTS ALLEGEDLY EARNED MILLIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ AND DON AUCOIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Prime-time television's role as a combatant in the war on drugs
is being highlighted by a story alleging that broadcasters reaped
financial gain by including antidrug messages in prime-time
programs as part of an arrangement with the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   According to the online magazine Salon, the six broadcast
networks _ NBC, ABC, CBS, Fox, WB, and UPN _ have earned nearly $25
million from a complex advertising deal under which government
officials and their ``contractors'' approved and sometimes changed
scripts ``to conform with the government's antidrug messages.''
</P>
<P>
   All the networks _ except the WB network, which had no immediate
comment to The Boston Globe _ denied that scripts or program
content had been altered to accommodate the government. In a
typical response, Rosalyn Weinman, NBC executive vice president of
broadcast content policy, said the network ``never ceded content
control of any of our programming'' to the government and ``at no
time did NBC turn over scripts for approval.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Bob Weiner, a spokesman for federal drug czar Barry
McCaffrey, insisted that ``We don't clear scripts.''
</P>
<P>
   However, some networks did gain financially by airing programs
with antidrug messages that met the approval of the White House
Office of National Drug Control Policy. Certain antidrug themes
within entertainment programs qualified as virtual public service
announcements, allowing the networks to reclaim antidrug
advertising time and sell it at higher rates.
</P>
<P>
   According to the online magazine, episodes of such programs as
NBC's ``ER,'' ABC's ``The Practice,'' and CBS's ``Cosby'' were
``assigned a monetary value by the drug czar's office and its two
ad buyers.'' The Associated Press reported that the WB network
altered an episode of ``The Smart Guy'' to make drug-using teens
look like ``losers'' after a government review.
</P>
<P>
   Weiner said that more than 100 programs last year did receive
credit for antidrug messages, and that roughly a dozen were
rejected. But he insisted that those shows were only reviewed after
they were completed. Another two dozen shows voluntarily approached
the drug office for technical script advice on how to accurately
depict drug abuse, but did not accrue any financial benefits for
doing so, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law mandates that we have entertainment industry
collaboration to fashion antidrug messages in television
programming,'' he said. ``We plead guilty to using every lawful
means to save the lives of America's children.''
</P>
<P>
   But the extent of television's role in that crusade is at the
heart of the explosive charges in Salon. If the government was
actually involved in crafting antidrug story lines for television
shows' ``that's really frightening,'' said Robert J. Thompson, of
Syracuse University's Center for the Study of Popular Television.
``The most fundamental issue here is that short of debates and
political advertising, has the federal government got any business
using the television airwaves in that fashion?''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine reported that the arrangement began two years ago
when Congress approved $1 billion to buy antidrug commercials on
network television, but only if the ad time was sold to the
government at half-price. The magazine said that the the Office of
National Drug Control Policy offered to relinquish some of that
cut-rate commercial time back to the networks ``in return for
getting anti-drug motifs incorporated within specific prime-time
shows.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With the deal in place, government officials and their
contractors began approving, and in some cases altering, the
scripts of shows before they were aired to conform with the
government's anti-drug message,'' according to Salon.
</P>
<P>
   On that point, the networks delivered unequivocal denials. ``At
no point has the independence or the creative integrity of our
programming been compromised,'' said CBS spokesman Dana McClintock.
Fox issued a statement that said that while the network ``is proud
of its work with ONDCP and remains committed to working with the
office in promoting its antidrug efforts. ... At no time has the
ONDCP either sought or been granted creative control over Fox
program content.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC spokeswoman Julie Hoover said the network ``never submitted
scripts ahead of time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This has had no impact whatsoever on UPN programming, nor has
UPN actively requested any of our writers or producers to provide
storylines for ONDCP sponsorship,'' said UPN spokesman Paul
McGuire.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Forbes, the New York freelancer who wrote the article for
Salon magazine, said ``we stand by the story 1000 percent. They
(the networks) are running as fast as they can. They're lying
through their teeth.''

 Bay Area Leads California in Holiday Shopping Online  &HT;     By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   The Bay Area leads the state in Internet shopping, according to
a poll that will be released today.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bay Area, 27 percent of those surveyed by the Public
Policy Institute of California said they bought a holiday gift over
the Internet last year, and 30 percent said they plan to make an
online purchase this year.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, only 20 percent of those surveyed made a holiday
purchase on the Internet, and 23 percent plan to buy online year.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate report released yesterday, Jupiter Communications
Inc. said 25 million consumers across America spent $7 billion
shopping online over the holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter, a New York research firm, found that 90 percent of
those online shoppers were satisfied customers, a jump from the 74
percent who said they were satisfied by the online experience in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Still, cybershopping runs a distant second to brick-and-mortar
shopping. According to the PPIC poll, a whopping 77 percent of the
state's residents planned ``very little or no shopping'' on the Web
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend to forget about that fact that this is still a new
technology that hasn't taken hold for a large number of people on a
frequent basis,'' said Mark Baldassare, state survey director for
the PPIC. ``I hope the numbers provide a little bit of a reality
check.''
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit PPIC, which was established in 1994 with an
endowment from Silicon Valley pioneer William Hewlett, included for
the first time several Internet and computer-related questions in
its regular survey of adults in California.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, meant to gauge social, economic and political forces
that could affect state elections, canvassed 2,007 adults by phone
from January 2 to January 10, with an error rate of plus or minus
two percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The pollsters asked whether the residents bought any holiday
gifts over the Internet in the past few months. Of the total, 5
percent said they bought ``a lot,'' 15 percent answered ``some''
and 44 percent answered ``no.'' The remaining 36 percent said they
did not use the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Of the Bay Area residents questioned, 7 percent said they bought
of gifts online, and 20 percent said they bought some.
</P>
<P>
   Central Valley residents were the least likely to buy online,
with only 3 percent buying a lot and 13 percent buying some. Of
Southern California residents outside of Los Angeles, 21 percent
said they had made some or a lot of purchases.
</P>
<P>
   In another question, 5 percent statewide said they planned ``a
lot'' of online purchases this year, while 18 indicated they would
make ``some.'' But 21 percent answered ``very little'' and 20
percent said ``not at all.''
</P>
<P>
   About 30 percent of Bay Area residents said they planned some or
a lot of online shopping this year, compared with 21 percent in the
Central Valley, 20 percent in Los Angeles and 22 percent in the
rest of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   The poll revealed that a majority of the online shoppers were
affluent. About 72 percent of people who shopped online frequently
made $80,000 per year or more.
</P>
<P>
   Baldassare said he was surprised to find far less opposition in
California to Internet sales taxes than he expected. In fact, 52
percent of the online shoppers favored requiring companies to
collect sales taxes on Internet sales, with 41 percent opposed and
7 percent having no opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to find instances where people favored taxes,''
Baldassare said.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also showed a Digital Divide still exists between white
and Latino residents in the state. The poll said only 21 percent of
Latino respondents used computers often, compared with 51 percent
of non-Hispanic white residents.
</P>
<P>
   And only 9 percent of Latinos surveyed said they were likely to
buy online this year, compared with 27 percent of non-Hispanic
white residents. Sixty percent said they did not use the Internet
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Baldassare said those numbers could indicate lack of marketing
by the high-tech community toward Latinos, who are projected to
outnumber whites in California by 2020.

 New Eye Laser Gets the Wink From FDA Panel  &HT;     By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Baby Boomers who can't see as well as they used to could soon have
a new alternative to glasses or contact lenses, now that a
government panel has endorsed a noninvasive type of laser surgery
for farsightedness.
<P>
   Yesterday's decision by a Food and Drug Administration advisory
panel was a turnabout for Sunrise Technologies International of
Fremont, whose laser device was rejected by the same panel in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both votes were unanimous, but we like this one a whole lot
better,'' Sunrise Chief Executive Officer Russell Trenary joked
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the full FDA generally follows advisory panel votes,
Trenary said it could be six months before its laser clears the
last regulatory hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   Sunrise failed its first advisory panel vote in July because
panelists worried the effects of the eye surgery would wear off
over time.
</P>
<P>
   In yesterday's vote, the FDA panel suggested the product be
labeled as temporary vision correction for farsighted people over
age 40.
</P>
<P>
   Many people are born with farsightedness _ or hyperopia _ but
never notice it, because their eye muscles automatically compensate
for the problem. After 40, however, as the eye muscles lose their
flexibility, many people begin having trouble reading books or
start seeing faraway objects as blurs, said Robert Doyle Stulting,
a medical consultant with Sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunrise LTK laser heats a circle of tissue around the eye _
like cinching up a belt _ to do what the eye muscles can no longer
do naturally.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA panel was concerned that this ``belt tightening'' might
relax over time, causing a relapse of farsightedness.
</P>
<P>
   David Gruber, an analyst with Lehman Brothers in New York,
called the temporary designation ``no big deal'' and predicted that
the Sunrise laser would reach a large and untapped market.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a really safe procedure that is going to be cheaper
than other laser surgery alternatives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA has already approved a competing laser surgery technique
for farsightedness from Sunnyvale's Visx. The Visx laser, named
Lasik, is already in widespread use for myopia.
</P>
<P>
   Also called nearsightedness, myopia is the ability to see
close-up but not far away. It manifests itself at an early age and
affects about 75 million Americans _ roughly the same number that
suffer from hyperopia.
</P>
<P>
   In a Lasik treatment, the laser actually cuts the eye and
removes some tissue to correct the myopia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it a flap and zap,'' said Gruber. ``You cut the
cornea, flip it over like a door hinge, remove some tissue and flap
it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Gruber said the Sunrise procedure is less invasive and was
designed specifically for hyperopia. He predicted eye surgeons
would prefer the Sunrise technique for hyperopia because it is
simpler and involves no cutting.
</P>
<P>
   Sunrise officials were cagey about the eventual price of the
procedure, but suggested it might run about $1,000 per eyeball.
</P>
<P>
   Sunrise shares, which had traded as high as $20 in early July,
fell $4 after the first FDA advisory panel rejection. Its stock
ended yesterday at $10.06 after trading was halted while the FDA
panel deliberated.

 Intel Posts Record Results  &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
If we've really entered the ``post-PC era,'' you wouldn't know it
by the financial results Intel posted yesterday.
<P>
   The Santa Clara chip behemoth reported record revenues, net
income and unit shipments for the last quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for the fourth quarter was $8.2 billion, up 8 percent
from the year before and 12 percent from the third quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Net income was $2.1 billion (61 cents per share), up from $2.06
billion (59 cents) a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding acquisition-related costs, net income reached $2.4
billion (69 cents) in the latest quarter. That was well above both
analysts' consensus estimate of 63 cents, according to First Call
Corp., and the ``whisper'' estimate, 65 cents. Whisper estimates
are given to big brokerage-house customers and often circulated on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   However, 5 cents of Intel's per-share earnings came not from
operations, but from gains realized by selling shares in companies
Intel's venture fund has invested in, said Mark Edelstone, an
analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in San Francisco. Excluding
those earnings, the figure would be much closer to consensus
estimates and right in line with Edelstone's prediction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty much what we expected,'' he said, ``but it was a
very a solid quarter and a foundation for what should be a very
strong year 2000. It was all about solid PC demand, plus excellent
execution on Intel's part.''
</P>
<P>
   Edelstone said Intel maximized its product mix between
higher-margin, high-performance chips and lower-margin but
higher-volume ``value'' microprocessors. Intel also increased its
average selling price and slightly exceeded revenue and
gross-margin forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Intel said its gross margins for the fourth quarter were 61.3
percent, up from 58.7 percent for the same period last year.
Company officials had predicted an increase, but only of 2 percent.
Andy Bryant, the company's chief financial officer, said the
unexpected increase was largely a function of
higher-than-anticipated levels of demand.
</P>
<P>
   Intel said it set records for quarterly unit shipments not just
of microprocessors, but also of several of its other products:
chipsets, the companion chips that coordinate the various
components of a PC; motherboards, which the company sells to many
PC vendors; and flash memory, a type of memory widely used in cell
phones, digital cameras and other devices.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, demand was so strong that Intel's inventories were down
9 percent in the quarter across all product categories. ``They're
less than we'd like, as they have been for several quarters,''
Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Intel customers have complained that the company has
recently been unable to meet their demand. Last week Gateway, a
major PC-maker, blamed Intel for a shortfall in its own revenues,
claiming that its ``supply of key processors and motherboards was
severely constrained, spotty and unreliable.'' Gateway then
announced that it would resume buying some chips from Intel's chief
rival, Advanced Micro Devices.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Otellini, general manager of the Intel Architecture
Business Group, said yesterday that some ``tightness'' in supply
continues but that the company expects it to ease during the
current quarter. ``We expect to be able to satisfy demand for the
first quarter overall,'' he said in a conference call with
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   For all of 1999, Intel revenues totaled $29.4 billion, up 12
percent from $26.3 billion in 1998. Net income was $7.3 billion, up
20 percent from $6.1 billion the previous year.

   Intel's 4th-Quarter Profit Tops Wall Street Forecasts
</P>
<P>
   After three quarters of results that disappointed investors,
Intel posted fourth-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall Street's
expectations because of strong demand for personal computers and a
shift toward higher-performance chips that have bigger profit
margins. Excluding costs related to acquisitions, profit rose 15
percent, to 69 cents a share, topping forecasts of 63 cents, while
revenue rose 8 percent. Shares of Intel edged down to $91.0625 in
regular trading but soared as high as $95.75 in after-hours
trading.

AOL AND TIME WARNER SHARE PRICES REBOUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The two-day slide in the shares of America Online reversed
Thursday as its stock jumped 7.5 percent, to $64.50.
</P>
<P>
   In the first three trading days after the announcement Monday
morning of America Online's deal to buy Time Warner for $165
billion in stock, its shares fell by 19 percent, to $60 on
Wednesday. Analysts said that those investors who followed a
momentum strategy _ investing in companies with the fastest growth
_ sold their America Online shares because they thought the merger
would slow its growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been the fastest growing company in the S.&AMP; P. 500,''
said Henry Blodget, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. ``When you blend
these two companies it becomes less attractive to momentum
investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Such investors, however, represent a small percentage of America
Online's overall shareholder base, and analysts said that most
holders appear for now to support the deal.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, said Paul Noglows, an analyst with Chase H&AMP;Q,
America Online's growth was bound to slow because it was getting so
much bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Time Warner rose $4.375 Thursday, to $84. They were at
$64.75 on Friday, the day before the acquisition was announced. The
combined company will be called AOL Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts continued to work through the company's prospective
financial position as they project its revenue and earnings. The
deal will force investors in both companies to change the way they
evaluate its stock price.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the deal's oddities, America Online has been one of
the few Internet companies to report a profit, but the acquisition
of Time Warner will cause it to lose money for years. Time Warner,
by itself, had only recently started reporting profits, largely
because it had been saddled by the cost of its cable systems and
the debt incurred in the merger of Time Inc. and Warner
Communications 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the huge premium that America Online is paying for
Time Warner's shares will cause it to write off $7.5 billion in
goodwill _ a noncash accounting charge _ from its earnings each
year for the next 20 years. That means the company will lose money
for about five years, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Like most companies in the cable television industry, which
typically do not show profits, Time Warner has been valued on its
pretax operating earnings.
</P>
<P>
   America Online hopes that its investors will similarly look past
the lack of profit to its operating earnings and cash flow.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not at all clear what value to put on those figures.

   Blodget calculates, for example, that before the merger America
Online was trading at 55 times its pretax operating earnings, while
Time Warner had a multiple of 14.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company, he calculated, will have combined
operating earnings of $11 billion in 2001. Blodget figured the
company's multiple to pretax operating earnings should range
between 25 and 40, implying a stock price between $55 and $88 a
share. &QL;

PUFF DADDY INDICTED OVER GUNS IN NIGHTCLUB SHOOTINGS CASE 
</HEADLINE>
 (jw) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Manhattan grand jury Thursday charged Sean Combs,
the rap performer better known as Puff Daddy, with possession of
two illegal handguns as part of its investigation into shootings
that wounded three people on Dec. 27 at a Times Square nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   Combs took the unusual step of testifying in his own defense,
but the indictment appears to rely on the account of a 42-year-old
father of three who was his part-time driver that night. While the
testimony of the driver, Wardell Fenderson, is sealed, evidence
presented by prosecutors indicated that he saw Combs throw a gun
out the window of the car as they fled police.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment presents another daunting challenge for Combs, a
30-year-old multimillionaire, Grammy-winning artist and producer,
who socializes with the city's elite and has a knack for surviving
seemingly disastrous blows to his career.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he faces poor sales of his latest record, other artists
leaving his recording label and rumblings of discontent from his
corporate backer, Combs must now resolve criminal charges that
carry a penalty of up to 15 years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The rapper, whose business empire includes the Bad Boy
Entertainment music label, a restaurant chain, a clothing line and
a television production company, added the lawyer Johnnie Cochran
Jr. to his legal team Thursday and issued a statement vehemently
denying the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision to indict me is wrong,'' Combs said. ``I'm
innocent and we will prove it. I am putting my faith in God, and I
know my name will be cleared.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Lopez, the singer and actress who was in the car with
Combs, stood by him Thursday. She issued a statement saying she had
``cooperated fully'' with the district attorney's office and was
``surprised and saddened'' by the indictment. ``I was with him that
evening,'' she said. ``At no time did I see him with a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Cochran said, ``We ask the public, Sean's
millions of fans and those with whom he is involved in various
business ventures to withhold judgment until the case is over.''
</P>
<P>
   The indictment charged Combs with possession of a 9 millimeter
handgun found inside the car, and with possession of another 9
millimeter gun that was thrown from the car as it sped away from
the crowded Club NY on West 43rd Street. Two of Combs' associates
were also named in the indictment: Jamal Barrow, a rapper, who has
been charged with three counts of attempted murder stemming from
the accusation that he pulled his own gun and fired it three times
in the club, and a bodyguard, Anthony Jones, on a weapons charge.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Thursday, Manhattan District Attorney
Robert M. Morgenthau said that a 1999 Lincoln Navigator in which
Combs was riding had secret compartments for hiding contraband or
other materials. He said nothing had been found in the
compartments.
</P>
<P>
   But law enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of
anonymity said there was evidence that Combs and his bodyguard
tried to stash the guns in the compartments as the police pursued
them but were unable to open them. Combs threw his gun out the
window, they said, and Jones placed his on the car floor. Someone
walking down Eighth Avenue saw the gun thrown from the vehicle,
picked it up and later turned it over to police, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials also said Thursday that they were
investigating accounts that Combs was heard in jail, where he was
held overnight, offering Fenderson, the driver, a $300,000 ring and
$50,000 in cash if he would back up Combs' version of events.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Brounstein, the lawyer representing Fenderson, declined
to comment Thursday on whether the driver testified before the
grand jury. But he thanked the panel for not indicting his client
and praised prosecutors for a ``fair'' investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Fenderson is not a member of the tightly knit group of employees
and friends who work for Combs, according to people familiar with
the case. For the last five years, they said, he worked as a
full-time private driver for a wealthy person and had only worked
for Combs on weekends since October. The wealthy person has
dismissed Fenderson out of apparent concern about fallout from the
case.

SUPERVISING THE GRAYBEARDS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 16) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Mass., Conn., Ga.)   (af)  
 By ABBY ELLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   The Look. Mary Rodas can spot it a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   It's not malicious, but it's certainly cutting, even though
she's used to it. That is because at age 24, Ms. Rodas is a vice
president at Kardz.com, a New York City company that delivers
inexpensive gifts matched with greeting cards.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, she has been in the toy business since she was 14,
when she helped create the Balzac, a cloth balloon ball that helped
turn Catco, a division of Catalyst Toys, into a $70 million
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   And so when she gets the Look _ a raised eyebrow, a questioning
glance _ she is not surprised. ``I go into meetings with people who
are my parents' and grandparents' age,'' said Ms. Rodas, who
supervises five people, all significantly older. ``When people meet
me their first response is: `Who's this little kid?' Or else they
say, `Can I speak to your boss?' And I point to myself and say,
`That's her.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rodas said she earned respect through hard work and getting
to know her workers. ``I know my product, and within time people
realize that I'm talking to them as an individual and an equal,''
she said. ``I've been in this industry for 11 years. I know what
I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. The workplace is now filled with young whippersnappers,
and some supervisors are half the age of their staff. The Labor
Department says 5.2 million people ages 20 to 34 were in management
last year, up from 4.8 million in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In the executive ranks, some older men try to compete by using
hair color and chemical peels. But for young executives, managing
older people is more than an aesthetic challenge. Among the
questions they ask themselves are: Will I be taken seriously? Will
they resent taking orders from someone so young, especially when
they were in this industry before I was born?
</P>
<P>
   ``I see myself as a kid running this multimillion-dollar
company,'' said Gregg Levin, 31, chief executive of Perfect Curve,
Inc., a company in Sudbury, Mass., that makes racks for baseball
caps and related products. ``Sometimes I feel I'm just playing. A
president is in his 50s or 60s, not 31.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Levin _ who counts his father among five employees _
dismissed a 38-year-old subordinate. ``I'm younger than he is and
this guy hasn't caught a break his whole life. But as much as I
wanted to help the guy, I have a business to run.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other issues. Levin's father, who is 66, does not use
a computer. ``He takes out his legal pad and spends an extra hour
on something that takes me four and a half minutes on the
computer,'' he said. ``Everyone in the company is computer literate
and we have to adjust to him. Sometimes I lose my patience, but I
have to be cognizant of the fact that he's 66.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin is also aware of his own appearance. No flannel shirts,
baggy jeans or eyebrow rings. ``I'm always in a suit and tie,'' he
said. ``If I'm going to represent my company I've got to do it in a
mature fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Young supervisors need to realize that they cannot overlook the
experience of older employees, said Bruce Tulgan, 32, founder of
RainmakerThinking Inc., a consulting firm in New Haven. ``Older
people know what's been tried in the past, what worked and what
didn't,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's not just enough to look mature; you've got to
act that way. Reggie Bradford, 33, chief marketing officer of
Healtheon/WebMD, an online health care company in Atlanta, is in
charge of 45 people ages 19 to 53.
</P>
<P>
   ``You respect the fact that a 30-year health care veteran may
understand the business,'' he said. ``But I can bring new
approaches and new solutions to older problems.''
</P>
<P>
   His advice? ``Check your ego at the door.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be resistance, of course. Bradford _ who himself
reports to a 30-year-old chief executive, his college roommate _
recalled that when executives were considering a partnership with
Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., an older employee discouraged them.
``He said no traditional media company that large would partner
with a Web site,'' Bradford said, ``but he was wrong.'' The deal
went through in December. ``Youth won out over experience.'' &QL;

THROWING A BEANBALL IN BUSINESS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 16) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Maine)   (af)  
 By JEFFREY L. SEGLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bigoted remarks made by John Rocker of the Atlanta Braves in
a magazine interview have been widely reported. Rocker, 25, a
relief pitcher, slammed Asian drivers, the foreigners on
Manhattan's streets, a subway-riding AIDS patient and a black
teammate whom he called a ``fat monkey.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps without the added burden of tabloid headlines, many
businesses face similar situations: A star employee's privately
tolerated ``idiosyncrasies'' spin out of control, and management
must respond publicly. ``In the business world, there's a very good
chance that somebody like this would be fired immediately,'' said
Joseph L. Badaracco Jr., professor of business ethics at the
Harvard Business School. ``The hideous content of his views would
badly damage the company's reputation, so they'd want to
disassociate themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The team did not do that, though it had the right to, according
to Jim Schultz, a spokesman for the Braves. ``John's remarks do
merit some kind of discipline,'' Schultz said, but the case is now
out of the team's hands: Bud Selig, the baseball commissioner, has
ordered Rocker to undergo psychological evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   These are practical responses, damage control if you will. But
what about the ethics of the matter? Do the Braves have any
business punishing a player whose on-field antics and volatile
behavior have until now been tolerated by teammates and management,
merely for escalating his rhetoric?
</P>
<P>
   The team's conduct _ summed up by the cynical observation, ``Do
you know how hard it is to find good relief?'' _ certainly doesn't
give management the moral high ground. But rationalizing
idiosyncrasies in a star performer is common in business.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge amount of hypocrisy insofar as there are no
sanctions brought to bear on these people until such time as they
gore the wrong ox,'' said Dr. Steven Berglas, a clinical
psychologist who teaches at the Anderson School of Management at
UCLA. If the Braves knew in advance about Rocker's sentiments, he
said, then they, too, must share some of the blame: ``Every time
you look away, you're an enabler.''
</P>
<P>
   When an employer can accept and sometimes even applaud star
employees' behavior that most would find repugnant, it can lead to
a ``moral incoherence,'' said Rushworth M. Kidder, founder of the
Institute for Global Ethics in Camden, Maine. What is needed, he
said, is the ability ``to think carefully from our moral premises
to our moral conclusions and have a consistency about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The inconsistency in the Rocker matter is clear: Where was Major
League Baseball's concern about his psychological state before his
latest remarks hit the headlines? Much can be gained ``by having a
courageous company step forward earlier rather than later and say,
`We don't tolerate this kind of stuff,''' Kidder said. ``If we
haven't established the fact that these things do matter, then
again and again you'll find companies knowing what to do but
waiting until the very last moment, because they don't quite dare
act up front.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is an ethical case for a hands-off policy on
the Braves' part: The man is entitled to his opinions, however
odious, and to say them out loud in a free country; he is paid only
to pitch. But tolerating the star's behavior means forfeiting any
standing to be shocked about it later.
</P>
<P>
   Making Rocker undergo psychological testing seems more an act of
political expediency than of ethical courage. And it may have
unintended consequences: If the tests merely confirm that Rocker is
no more unbalanced than the millions of Americans who share his
biases, they do nothing to resolve the matter; if they detect a
diagnosable psychological problem, the team may be required to make
some ``reasonable accommodation'' for Rocker under the Americans
With Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   Ethical consistency demanded a simpler and ultimately more
honest response: ``Hey, the guy's comments are abhorrent, but get a
load of his sinker.'' Now, the best that can be hoped for is that
the embarrassment of the incident will lead baseball to re-examine
its tolerance of workplace bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate cultures exist, Kidder observed, where ``it would
simply have been telegraphed from the very beginning that you don't
do that stuff here.'' Sadly, the Braves and Major League Baseball
have no such culture. Sadder still, many other workplaces will go
on turning a blind eye toward unethical behavior by star employees,
rising in indignation only when public pressure demands it.

TRADE SHOWS WITHOUT BORDERS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 16) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, N.Y., Conn.)   (af)  
 By LAURA PEDERSEN-PIETERSEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To Peter Nathan, the word ``no'' is merely a request for more
information. In the 1970s and '80s, Nathan, a trade show
impresario, arm-wrestled Soviet and Chinese apparatchiks into
allowing him past their frontiers to produce a variety of Western
industry shows.
</P>
<P>
   This week, he will preside over the five-day U.S. Healthcare
Exhibition _ the first American trade expo in Cuba in more than 40
years.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted by the trade embargo against Cuba (which does not
include medical supplies) and the tug-of-war over Elian Gonzalez,
6, the survivor of a shipwreck, Nathan is convinced that now is the
time to open up the Cuban market.
</P>
<P>
   Producing a trade show in that environment requires someone
special, said Steven Hacker, president of the International
Association for Exposition Management in Dallas, who called Nathan
``the Green Beret of international exhibitors.''
</P>
<P>
   As such, Nathan, 66, demonstrates that the advantages, and the
risks, of being an early mover extend far beyond the technology
world. With his forays into untested markets, Nathan is trying to
go where even major multinationals often stumble.
</P>
<P>
   Is the payoff worth it? ``Definitely,'' he said. ``The
authorities from those countries are pleased when someone takes an
interest in their country, and so, going forward, you have the ear
of the right people.''
</P>
<P>
   The humanitarian benefits of medical equipment and
pharmaceuticals would make the trade fair an easier sell to both
governments, he felt. While it took three years to get Washington's
approval, said John S. Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade
and Economic Council in New York, Havana approved in just 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely incredible what he's accomplished,'' Kavulich
said. ``Anyone else would have given up after getting turned down
so many times.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Kavulich told Nathan that he should consider his show
a success if only 10 exhibitors showed up. As of last week,
Nathan's company, PWN Exhibicon International LLC of Westport,
Conn., had signed more than 100. The principal sponsor is Archer
Daniels Midland, and other exhibitors include Eli Lilly, Medtronic,
Hewlett-Packard and Eastman Kodak.
</P>
<P>
   . Nathan relishes breaking into new territory. In 1971, long
before glasnost, he organized the first American industrial
machinery show in Russia, overcoming currency and language
barriers, shipping catastrophes and ``unfathomable amounts of red
tape.'' But dealing with Moscow became much easier, and other
successful shows followed.
</P>
<P>
   To make it in the business, ``you have to be a professional,
round-the-clock problem solver,'' he said. He has seen many of them
_ waking up to blizzards and an exhibit hall fire _ at McCormick
Place in Chicago _ and giving up many a night's sleep in union
confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   Why put on shows in markets like Cuba? ``The short answer is the
Mount Everest one,'' Nathan said. ``It's the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, his wife of 45 years, Sandy, enjoys the challenge,
too. She will be working as an on-site administrator in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan arrived on these shores in 1937 as a 4-yearold
German-Jewish immigrant; his family had fled the Nazis. He received
a bachelor's degree in life sciences from the University of
Connecticut in 1954. While waiting to start at the Marine Corps
officers school, Nathan took a temporary job as an office boy at
Clapp &AMP; Poliak, an exhibition company based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   After two years in the Marines during the Korean War, he
returned to the firm, eventually rising to partner. (He stayed with
the company until it was sold in 1982.)
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, the federal government hired Clapp &AMP; Poliak
to organize an air and transportation show at Dulles International
Airport outside Washington. That was the start of a long
relationship. Two years later, unhappy with local management of
Expo 74, the world's fair in Spokane, Wash., the government
persuaded Nathan to run the event for six months.
</P>
<P>
   President Richard M. Nixon, who was increasingly enmeshed in the
Watergate scandal, flew out to open the fair. While being escorted
around, Nixon pointed to the walkie-talkie in Nathan's hand and
asked, ```What's that?''' Nathan recalled. ``I explained it was a
two-way radio. Nixon replied, `It's not a tape recorder is it?
Because I don't like those things.'''
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Nathan put on the first two American electronics
exhibitions in China. At the first, in Beijing, the booths were
overrun by 20,000 Chinese consumers, leading panicky officials to
call in security. It wasn't needed. The friendly stampede was
simply the result of tremendous interest in American products. As
with the first show in Russia, many more exhibitions followed.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan expects his Cuban odyssey to have a similarly happy
ending. The licenses and approvals that he sought for so many years
were eventually granted. And the federal departments that stymied
Nathan for three years _ State, Commerce and Treasury _ are now
sharing a big booth at the show to encourage future trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very enthusiastic about the expo,'' said Charles S.
Shapiro, the director for Cuban Affairs at the State Department. He
attributes the turnaround in large part to President Clinton's call
last year for more people-to-people contacts with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Hollywood version should be called ``Mr. Nathan Goes
to Havana.'' &QL;

<P>
   CHICAGO _ Like some other PhDs who attended the annual Modern
Language Association conference last month in Chicago, April
Overstreet, 31, is committed to pursuing a tenure-track job in
academia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I love to do, and I believe in the value of what
I do,'' she said of her one-year post as a visiting assistant
professor in the Spanish and Portuguese department of the
University of Iowa. ``Not a lot of people can say that.''
</P>
<P>
   Scholars like Ms. Overstreet need to believe in their work,
because in one of the hottest employment markets in decades,
finding a humanities job in academia remains one of the toughest
assignments around. With universities continuing to rely on
part-time faculty in their English and foreign-language
departments, there is a short supply of jobs that lead to tenured
positions.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Overstreet, who is fluent in Spanish and proficient in
French and Portuguese, is the very portrait of commitment to her
field. She knew as an undergraduate that she wanted to pursue a PhD
in Spanish, so after graduation she traveled to Spain for two
years, supporting herself by teaching English and living in rural
areas where she could perfect her language skills and absorb the
culture.
</P>
<P>
   She then spent five and a half years earning her PhD at the
University of Michigan, where she worked about 30 hours a week as a
graduate student instructor in return for free tuition and enough
money to cover her living costs. When she wasn't teaching, she
worked on her dissertation _ a study of picaresque themes in four
Spanish novels.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all that training, Ms. Overstreet did not get a
tenure-track offer from an institution she would consider joining.
Instead, she found a good but temporary teaching position at Iowa,
a job that pays $30,000. But because she remains in the job market,
she must also further her research and keep filling out
applications.
</P>
<P>
   As new PhDs flock to the annual language association convention
for interviews, they compete not only with fellow graduates but
also with those from previous years who have failed to land
tenure-track posts. Doctoral candidates spend as many as 10 years
completing their degrees, so it is difficult for them to predict
what the job picture will be like when they graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 1990s, more than twice as many PhDs were granted
in these fields than there were tenure-track openings. In 1998,
according to the language association, 1,718 PhD' were granted in
English and foreign languages, but there were only 721 tenure-track
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In such a competitive market, it is not uncommon for a PhD in
English or a foreign language to spend several years as a visiting
professor or part-time faculty member, though some research
concludes that after three years of that lifestyle, many PhDs lose
their morale or their marketability. As the market remains tight,
the academics themselves have stepped up the debate about how to
handle the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to say that in our community, there are two distinct
points of view,'' says Phyllis Franklin, executive director of the
language association. While some academics still say doctorates are
meant only to prepare college teachers, a growing number say the
degrees can be used in many other fields that require the ability
to write, research and teach.
</P>
<P>
   Maggie Debelius and Sue Basalla, English PhD candidates at
Princeton, decided against full-time jobs in academia. But then
they had to translate their skills for use in the wider world.
While the occasional public relations firm, nonprofit group or
government agency will seek a PhD by advertising in the
association's job listings, PhDs who plan to look outside academia
usually need to take on their own career searches.
</P>
<P>
   To provide guidance, Ms. Debelius and Ms. Basalla have written a
book scheduled to be published this fall called, ``What Are You
Going to Do With That?'' (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux). PhDs are often
unaware of the breadth of options beyond academia, they said. ``We
were talking about how sad it was to see our friends from Princeton
taking bad jobs or a succession of one-years,'' Ms. Debelius said
of the book's genesis. ``It seemed such a waste of human
potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Basalla, a professor's daughter, said she decided in the
mid-'90s that she did not want to teach after she received her
graduate degree. Her parents agreed to support her for a year,
relieving her of her part-time teaching duties, so she could
complete the degree in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   After a year of job experimentation _ including an office
position at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, focused on health
care, she became a medical and health care journalist in Washington
at FDC Reports, a magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Debelius, who expects to finish her dissertation this year,
teaches part time at Georgetown University and works part time for
a Web start-up called Lifeminders.com, which publishes e-mail
newsletters. At Lifeminders, she realized that she liked spending
part of her time outside academia. Now she plans to continue this
double work life.
</P>
<P>
   For those looking for jobs, the language association offers a
two-day course at its annual convention, taught by a job search
expert, Howard Figler. Other organizations also offer help to PhDs
looking for work. The Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation
in Princeton, N.J., has enlisted companies ranging from Microsoft
to McKinsey, as well as private schools, to consider PhDs for jobs
with salaries in the $30,000 to $60,000 range. The Wilson
Foundation tries to match job candidates and companies.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation also gives grants to schools that foster work
experience outside academia for PhDs. The University of
Massachusetts at Amherst, for instance, is using a grant to pay
graduate students in English who serve as interns at local
publishers and other companies.
</P>
<P>
   For scholars who are committed to a traditional academic career,
learning to cope with the prolonged uncertainty of part-time or
visiting professorships seems, for now, to be just another part of
the job. Though a wave of university retirements is likely in the
next five years, it does not mean that much will change in the
short term.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the next stage of investment I have to put in,'' Ms.
Overstreet said of her first year on the visiting professor
circuit. ``Being in academia is like being an artist. If you can
possibly do anything else, you should.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Ask deans and professors at America's leading business schools
to weigh in on what has become the hottest controversy in
management education, and some decidedly unacademic epithets start
flying.
</P>
<P>
   Silly. Crazy. Dishonest. Stupid.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether the online selling, buying, marketing and
distribution of products _ known collectively as e-business _
should be taught as a separate academic subject or as an
inseparable part of a general business curriculum? Money, prestige
and the ability to attract the most desirable students hang in the
balance.
</P>
<P>
   Some deans have chosen separation, creating new majors that have
rapidly become among the most popular on campus. Other deans are
rolling their eyes at what they see as an empty gimmick and are
moving instead to weave e-business into existing majors and
courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're missing the point if you set up a separate program,''
said Edward A. Snyder, the dean of the University of Virginia's
Darden School.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems silly to ghetto-ize it into a course or a string of
courses,'' said Eric J. Johnson, a professor at Columbia Business
School.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like making it the flavor of the month,'' added
Robert S. Hamada, the dean of the University of Chicago Graduate
School of Business.
</P>
<P>
   What do advocates of a separate major make of such attacks?
</P>
<P>
   ``Crazy,'' said Donald Jacobs, the dean of Northwestern
University's Kellogg Graduate School of Management. ``It is crazy
not to do it separately.'' Success on the Internet calls for a very
different way of thinking than managers in traditional businesses
are trained for, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative approach is too slow, said Patrick T. Harker,
interim dean of the Wharton School at the University of
Pennsylvania. Integrating e-business throughout a curriculum
``doesn't happen overnight,'' he said, ``and anybody who says it
does is not telling the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Is that all, gentlemen? Not quite yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (italics)does(end italics) happen overnight,'' responded
Johnson, who taught at Wharton with Harker until this fall. ``It
has happened overnight in the real world. Business schools are
trying to catch up.''
</P>
<P>
   All the schools are devoting vast resources to writing new case
studies about the Internet, overhauling existing courses to reflect
the changes it has caused, and using online material to supplement
lectures. Deans of schools on both sides of the divide say
corporate recruiters will snap up MBAs who seem to understand how
the World Wide Web is changing the economy. And prospective
students will shun any school they see as lagging behind the
Internet revolution.
</P>
<P>
   But the deans part company on how best to stay abreast. ``They
are very different paths that the schools have taken,'' said Cathy
Baker, the vice president in charge of recruiting at Mercer
Management Consulting, which plans to hire about 90 MBAs this year.
</P>
<P>
   The debate mirrors one raging in the bricks-and-mortar economy.
Some companies, like General Electric, have directed managers in
every department to rethink their business with the Internet in
mind, while others have set up separate Web divisions meant to stay
free of corporate bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   At separate-major schools like Wharton, Northwestern, the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and New York University,
professors say they are able to study e-business intensively and to
spread its lessons to other departments.
</P>
<P>
   Northwestern is typical. Last spring, a committee appointed by
the dean found that its proliferating e-business offerings were too
haphazard and were leaving some gaps. So the school brought the
faculty together to fill out its course roster, eliminate overlap
and inaugurate a major in technology and e-commerce last fall.
</P>
<P>
   After a first year of core subjects, students in the program
take a survey course, then choose 3 of 16 electives ranging from
data mining, a new class taught by an engineering professor, to the
evolution of Silicon Valley, a class that includes a weeklong
California trip to meet with dozens of chief executives.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   MIT is one of several schools that have set up research centers
along with the new majors. Its Center for eBusiness draws faculty
from the business school and from media and computer science
laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Carrie Oliver, 28, is in her second year at Vanderbilt
University's business school, which in 1995 became the first major
school to offer such an e-business program. After working for
Sanford C. Bernstein, an investment firm in New York, she wanted to
concentrate on studying Internet commerce and applied only to
Vanderbilt, she said. About 90 percent of her elective courses have
been inside the major.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recruiters can't get enough of us,'' she said of her class of
e-business majors. She credits the e-business label and the
specialized course work with helping her land job offers from
Deloitte &AMP; Touche, Nortel Networks and a small Internet start-up.
</P>
<P>
   Faculty members at other leading schools, like those at Chicago,
Columbia and Dartmouth, are skeptical. Often, they say, the
creation of an e-business major is little more than a marketing
exercise, rearranging existing classes under a new heading.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to raise money'' for programs labeled
``e-business,'' Hamada of Chicago said, noting that dot-com
millionaire alumni are often willing to donate to them.
</P>
<P>
   The skeptical schools are using other strategies to make their
programs Internet-aware. The University of Virginia's
Charlottesville campus was host to 1,000 PricewaterhouseCoopers
partners for three-day sessions last summer and fall to discuss and
study the Internet. The school then rewrote parts of its first-year
MBA curriculum to reflect what it learned from the consultants,
Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia's approach has been to recruit Johnson from Wharton,
revamp syllabuses for 30 courses in the last year and create seven
new ones with heavy Internet emphasis in marketing, finance and
other departments.
</P>
<P>
   These schools also know that they must work harder to broadcast
the weight they give the Internet. Hamada says he has instructed
his recruiting director to tell prospective MBAs at admissions
conferences that e-business is no less important at Chicago than it
is at schools with separate majors.
</P>
<P>
   Their job may be easier among corporate recruiters, many of whom
put more stock in candidates' intelligence than in course work.
``What we're looking for is talent, and not a specific major,'' Ms.
Baker of Mercer said. She said she found the most Internet-oriented
MBAs at Harvard and Stanford, neither of which offers a specialized
major.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides of the argument agree that the Internet is crucial
to the future of business schools, and there is a consensus that
the schism will narrow in time, as it did in a similar debate in
the 1980s over the wisdom of separate international management
concentrations. With globalization now an important theme in most
courses, the international majors that still exist are dwindling in
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long run,'' said Harker, Wharton's interim dean, ``it
makes no sense to have a separate major'' about e-business. ``The
question is how you get from here to there.''

 &HT;    Ethics problems plague Texas school fund
 &HT;    By A. Phillips Brooks
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ As State Board of Education members on Thursday
sought to fix ethical and management problems with the $20 billion
Permanent School Fund they oversee, they treaded back into an
ethical dilemma by recommending the hire of a financial consultant
who may have violated a board ethics rule.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether Russell Stein, a senior vice president for
First Union Securities, violated the ethics rule, which prohibits
people or businesses from contacting board members as they
deliberate on their contracts. Stein confirmed that he had coffee
with three board members on Thursday morning, including the
chairman and vice chairman of the board committee deciding his
contract. Later Thursday, the committee _ in a split vote _ voted
to hire Stein to evaluate performance of the board's private
money-management firms.
</P>
<P>
   While some board members said that is a clear violation of the
ethics rule, others disagreed, saying Stein was not under the rule
because board members merely were extending his existing contract
rather than hiring him to a new one. His previous contract expired
in November.
</P>
<P>
   The board, during the past year, has been embroiled in factional
fighting _ mostly between its Republican social conservative
members and other Democrats and Republicans _ over management of
the school fund. The acrimony has prompted some state lawmakers to
call for replacing the elected board with an appointed one.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was the second time Stein has been accused of violating
the ethics rule. Last fall, he contacted seven board members
through intermediaries as they deliberated on his contract. The
rule aims to prevent influence-peddling by companies seeking board
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Stein in the previous meeting violated our no-contact rule
and I think he recently violated our no-contact rule,'' Democrat
Will Davis told board members Thursday. ``I don't think its
appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Stein said he did not violate the no-contact rule. ``I do not
think I violated the no-contact policy by being at a breakfast
table in a crowded restaurant and Bob Offutt and David Bradley
walking up and sitting down in an open crowded restaurant,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was the lone board member on the five-member committee who
voted against hiring Stein to a three-year contract to evaluate a
dozen investment firms that manage about a third of the Permanent
School Fund. Board Chairman Chase Untermeyer (R-Houston) abstained.
Casting votes in favor of Stein were Offutt, a San Antonio
Republican who chairs the committee; Bradley, a Beaumont Republican
who is vice chair of the committee, and Democrat Joe Bernal of San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Under the contract approved by the committee, Stein's firm would
be paid about $76,000 a year to evaluate private money managers,
which invest about $7 billion of the school trust fund. The full
15-member board still must vote to the contract with Chicago-based
First Union Securities, which is likely to happen today.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over Stein's contract came as the board took
steps to hire a lead financial consultant to oversee the school
trust fund. The Chicago firm that held the contract quit last year,
citing conflicts and instability on the education board. The
company, Richards and Tierney, however, has bid on the contract.
They said their bid was contingent on the board working out its
conflicts. On Thursday, the fund committee selected six companies _
including Richards and Tierney, as finalists for the contract,
which ranges from $200,000 to $400,000 a year. A final selection is
expected in March. Meanwhile, the House Committee on General
Investigating is examining decisions the board has made regarding
management of the Permanent School Fund, and another Senate
Committee is reviewing its investment policies and practices.
Though the Permanent School Fund, a trust fund that funnels about
$700 million a year to Texas public schools, for decades was
operated quietly and conservatively, it has been plagued by
allegations of mismanagement, influence peddling and ethics
violation for the past several years. The fund consists mostly of
stocks and bonds, as well as oil and gas royalties from public
lands. In 1995, the board hired several private firms to help
manage some of the fund in an effort to maximize investments. The
board increased private money managers to a dozen in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A review by the State Auditor and the Attorney General cleared
money managers of the allegations. The Attorney General review
chided the board for not following its own rules, including the
no-contact ethics rule.

SPAIN'S TELEFONICA TO BUY OUT 4 PHONE COMPANIES IN LATIN AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By AL GOODMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain _ Spain's dominant telephone company, Telefonica
SA, said Thursday that it would offer $21.5 billion in stock to buy
out four big phone companies that it already controls in Latin
America, tightening its grip on the region.
</P>
<P>
   Telefonica will also realign the Latin American businesses along
product lines, separating the wireless and data units from the four
companies and merging them with the Spanish assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the most important operation since Telefonica
became a company,'' said Juan Villalonga, the former state
monopoly's chairman, who oversaw its privatization in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The deal cements Telefonica's position as the leading
communications company in Latin America. It is offering to buy out
shareholders in Telefonica de Argentina SA, Telefonica del Peru SA
and two Brazilian companies, Telesp Participacoes SA, a fixed-line
company in Sao Paulo, and Telesudeste Celular Participacoes SA, a
wireless operator. Telefonica is offering to pay a premium of 40
percent over the average market price for each company during the
five trading days immediately before the deal was announced in
Madrid late Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of the companies rallied in Latin America after the
announcement, and the broad markets surged too. Investors are
``more likely to go for this than having bits and pieces of the
firms pulled off,'' said Stephen Heaps of Merrill Lynch in London.
</P>
<P>
   The offer, however, did not include Chile's main telephone
concern, Compania Telefonica de Chile, which Telefonica also
controls as the largest shareholder. Villalonga said Chilean law
prohibited an all-stock offer. But some analysts said the decision
was a result of complaints last year from fund managers who said
that Telefonica had paid too little for the Chilean company's
Internet unit, which became part of Telefonica's new Internet
company, Terra Networks. Terra made a rich stock market debut in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, it hardly hurt Chilean Telecom's stock. Its
American depository receipts surged $3, or 16.6 percent, in New
York on Thursday, to $21.125, in heavy trading of 1.75 million
units. Telefonica closed here up 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Telefonica's board will seek approval Feb. 4 to issue 922
million shares to pay for the buyout.
</P>
<P>
   Telefonica made its first investments in Chile in 1990 and has
since expanded to seven Latin American countries, including a $6
billion purchase in 1997 in Brazil's telecommunications
privatization.
</P>
<P>
   When the acquisition is complete, expected in four months,
Telefonica will close its Latin American division, and the company
will be organized along product lines.
</P>
<P>
   It has no immediate plans for a share sale in what will be the
new wireless unit, Telefonica Moviles, or the data unit, Telefonica
Datacorp. But another division, Telefonica Media, created late last
year for broadcasting properties in Spain and Latin America, will
be floated this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other companies are segregating their businesses,'' Villalonga
said. ``Increasingly, the interest comes for one or two lines of
the business and not the whole.''

THE DECISION GOES TO TYSON TO FIGHT FRANCIS IN BRITAIN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Nev.)   By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two days after three London mayoral candidates raised a furor
over his entry into the country, Mike Tyson has been cleared by the
Home Office to visit Britain for his Jan. 29 heavyweight fight
against Julius Francis in Manchester.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Home Office Secretary Jack Straw to allow Tyson
to enter the country bypasses possible objections by British
immigration officials, who could have kept Tyson out of the country
because of his 1992 rape conviction and the three and a half years
in prison he served in Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Under British immigration law, anyone convicted of a crime that
carries a sentence longer than 12 months can be denied entry into
the country. The Home Office is the agency that handles law
enforcement. Tyson plans to travel to London on Sunday. A private
gym will be set up for him at his hotel for daily workouts. He will
relocate to Manchester three days before the bout.
</P>
<P>
   ``What appears to have happened is there was an intelligent
decision reached and we're grateful for that,'' said Jay Larkin,
senior vice president of sports and event programming at Showtime.
Showtime will show a taped broadcast of the fight in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Straw said his decision was made because he did not want to hurt
the businesses in Manchester that were expecting a windfall from
the fight or disappoint the fans who had bought tickets. Frank
Warren, the fight's boxing promoter based in London, had said he
would lose $1 million if the fight did not happen. Warren also said
that all 21,000 seats at the MEN Arena had been sold.
</P>
<P>
   Shelly Finkel, Tyson's manager, said Tyson was happy that
everything has been settled.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a little upset when he thought he couldn't go, because
in some ways he's bigger over there than he is here,'' Finkel said.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Tyson's immigration problems was front-page news in
London for the past two days. The list of those who have weighed in
on the issue, including Prime Minister Tony Blair, has been
mind-boggling to those involved in this bout.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' Larkin said, ``that the prime minister of
England would be talking about Mike Tyson on the floor of
Parliament, which houses the oldest sitting legislative body in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson and his handlers thought he would be leaving controversy
behind by going overseas. The Nevada State Athletic Commission told
Tyson to fight elsewhere after his Oct. 23 bout against Orlin
Norris. Tyson hit Norris after the bell in the first round, and
Norris injured his knee while falling from the punch. Norris said
he could not continue and, because Referee Richard Steele ruled it
an accidental foul, the bout was ruled no contest.
</P>
<P>
   During a hearing on whether Tyson should keep his $8 million
purse, the Nevada commission told Tyson he would not be welcomed
back to fight in the state for a while. Madison Square Garden
officials have quietly let it be known that Tyson is not welcome
there, either.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, who will earn $12 million, has remained in Las Vegas to
train for his bout against Francis, a 35-year-old journeyman.

TREASURY PLANS TO BUY SOME BONDS BACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Throughout the deficit-plagued 1980s, the Treasury
Department struggled to find novel ways of financing the
government's ballooning daily expenses even as tax receipts fell
further and further behind.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Treasury still has a cash-flow crisis, but of a
different kind: It must figure out what to do with the windfall
cash generated as tax receipts continue to soar above expenses _ at
least until Congress and the White House agree how to spend or
refund the riches.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, outlined on Thursday by Treasury Secretary Lawrence
H. Summers, is to make the Treasury Department for the first time a
buyer as well as a seller of bonds. The Treasury, following some
standard Wall Street tactics, will start intervening in the open
market to manage its $3.6 trillion debt. Not unlike a company's use
of spare cash to buy back its own stock in hopes of propping up the
share price, the government hopes to lower its overall debt
interest payments as a result.
</P>
<P>
   The department plans to use up to $30 billion of surplus cash
this year to buy back outstanding debt, Summers said. It will try
to entice investors to sell old bonds on which the government pays
interest rates that are much higher than the prevailing rates
today. Using spare cash to play the bond market in this way is
unprecedented, senior Treasury officials said, though the
government jumped into the market to swap new debt for old debt in
the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buying back old, higher-interest debt allows us to manage the
federal debt in a way that saves the American taxpayer money,''
Summers said in rolling out the debt buyback program, which was
first broached last summer. ``This is a new and welcome debt
management challenge for the government.''
</P>
<P>
   The program will not be the main way the government reduces its
overall debt. That is done more or less automatically by paying off
investors whose bonds come due without issuing lots of new bonds.
In the last two years _ when the government started generating
surpluses for the first time since the 1960s _ it has reduced debt
by $140 billion in that way.
</P>
<P>
   The new intervention is aimed at accelerating the reduction of
debt and at increasing the trading of the bonds that remain in the
market. By limiting and simplifying the menu of bonds, the
government can increase buying or selling of what is on offer. That
reduces the risk investors take in buying the bonds, and means they
will often accept slightly lower interest payments.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of such financial wizardry tend to be measured in
basis points, or hundredths of percentage points. But when the
government has $3.6 trillion in publicly traded debt outstanding,
even a hundredth of a percentage point in savings equals $360
million in taxpayer money that can be used for some other purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury officials did not predict how much could be saved
through the buyback program, in part because it depends on how the
market reacts. The Treasury would like to buy back bonds paying
nearly 14 percent interest, as some old government issues do, and
force investors to buy newer issues that pay just over 6 percent.
But investors might well choose to hold to the higher-paying bonds,
even if the Treasury offers a nice premium in the open market to
buy them back.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury looks set to have plenty of extra cash to try its
hand at market intervention. After the budget surplus reached $69
billion in 1998 and $123 billion last year, the Congressional
Budget Office is predicting a surplus of $161 billion in fiscal
2000.  &QL;

 &HT;    Literature industry awaits Newberry contest
 &HT;    By Anne Morris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Harry Potter may have cast a spell over the New
York Times Best-Seller List, but in children's bookstores around
the country, they're talking about only one thing this week. Who
will win the big prizes Monday in San Antonio _ the Newbery for
children's literature and the Caldecott for picture books. (The
Coretta Scott King Award for African-American literature is
announced at the same time but doesn't have the same clout in the
market.) Potter's creator, J.K. Rowling _ a Brit through and
through _ isn't eligible for the strictly American award. (No
matter that the name Newbery comes from an 18th-century British
bookseller.)
</P>
<P>
   At this time of year, booksellers act like show-biz types just
before the Oscars, calling and e-mailing each other about who's
going to take home the medal (which is bronze, though the seal that
goes on the winning book is gold). Buzz about who will win
dominates list-servers such as Pubyac and Child-lit, where
children's librarians talk up their preferences. And the talk can
be all over the place, since the Newbery finalists aren't known in
advance _ they're announced on the same day as the winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sit and think about it all the time,'' says Tiffany Durham,
community relations director at Toad Hall children's bookstore.
``When `Holes' (by Austin writer Louis Sachar), which was set in
Texas, won last year, I was surprised. I didn't know if it would
have universal appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Sachar says his sales have tripled, maybe quadrupled, since he
won the award, and ``Holes'' has been translated into every
language he can think of. ``The Newbery is the one,'' he says.
``It's given me greater recognition as a serious author.''
</P>
<P>
   Sachar's favorite for this year's prize is ``Monster'' by Walter
Dean Myers, the story of a 16-year-old on trial for his supposed
role in shooting a convenience store owner.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about this year's winner includes Texan Kimberly
Willis Holt's ``When Zachary Beaver Came to Town,'' the story of a
13-year-old boy who realizes what is important in life when ``the
fattest boy in the world'' visits his small West Texas town. In
November, ``Zachary Beaver'' won the National Book Award for Young
People, the same award Sachar received before the Newbery. (Some
view the NBAYP as the Golden Globe of children's literature,
occasionally predicting Newbery honors. In 1969 the same book won
both; again in '75, '80 and '98.)
</P>
<P>
   A Publishers Weekly poll of children's booksellers picked Holt's
book for honorable mention _ a silver seal on the book _ along with
Gail Carson Levine's ``Dave at Night,'' a book about a Jewish boy
growing up in a New York orphanage who discovers a wider world in
Harlem. The poll showed Christopher Paul Curtis' ``Bud, Not
Buddy,'' about a 10-year-old African-American boy on the run from
foster homes in search of his father, as Best Bet to win.
</P>
<P>
   Awarded by the Association for Library Service to Children,
Newberys are chosen by a committee of 15 librarians _ half elected
by the association, half appointed by its president. Their names
remain secret until after the awards are made. Committee members
spend a year reading the thousand-plus books submitted. There will
be only one winner; honor books, they stress, are just that _ not
runners-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The books come in clumps, in spring and late fall,'' says
Austin librarian Jeanette Larsen (of the Texas State Library and
Archives Commission) who served on the Newbery committee in 1991
and 1997. ``Boxes and boxes and boxes arrive. Publishers don't want
to rule anybody out that might have a chance, and they don't want
to offend their authors by not nominating them _ even if they
aren't likely to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Committee members come up with their top three choices twice,
then meet in closed session to talk about their favorites. The
winner must have a certain number of first choice points to get the
medal. ``My favorite may not be the group's first choice to get the
medal, but the winner will be a book I can hold my head up about,''
Larsen says. They meet Friday, Saturday and Sunday at the ALA
midwinter meeting to read, talk and vote. ``It's a lot of fun,
actually,'' Larsen says. ``It's so much fun to sit around and talk
about books.'' The final days are under tight security, with
committee members carrying books in plain brown wrappers so
publishers won't know who the finalists are.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I look for in a Newbery is something distinguished,''
Larsen says. ``Does it hold up? Can I read it two or three times? A
week later, can I tell you anything about the plot? I also look for
inconsistencies. Are the characters believable? Nonfiction is more
difficult. You have to ask if it's telling the whole story.''
</P>
<P>
   Though such thoroughness means many of the choices are right on
_ 1968 winner ``From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E.
Frankweiler'' and 1961 winner ``Island of the Blue Dolphins'' are
still wildly popular _ not all the decisions have stood the test of
time equally well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little House on the Prairie'' author Laura Ingalls Wilder won
four silver seals, but no gold. Likewise, E.B. White's beloved
``Charlotte's Web'' received only honorable mention, as did the
still popular ``Mr. Popper's Penguins'' _ the book Al Gore says was
his favorite as a child. ``But not many kids would want to read
`The Story of Mankind,' the 1922 Newbery winner,'' Larsen says. And
who's heard of ``Thimble Summer,'' the book that beat out the
penguins? Perusing a list of past winners, Louis Sachar admits that
``most of them I haven't heard of.''
</P>
<P>
   Several winners and honor books enjoy additional fame because
they have gone on to become movies or television shows, such as
``Sarah Plain and Tall'' (1986), ``Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of
NIMH'' (1972), and ``Sounder'' (1970). ``Miracles on Maple Hill''
won the gold Newbery in 1957, but today more people recognize Texan
Fred Gipson's Honor Book ``Old Yeller,'' which was made into a
classic film.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Todaro, head librarian at the Rio Grande branch of Austin
Community College, served on the committee in '78-'79. ``Publishers
who were members of the American Library Association originated the
award (in 1921),'' Todaro says, though it was first given in 1922.
``They were trying to increase the number of people interested in
writing quality children's books. It's not a popularity award.
You're looking for quality. No one says the kids will love it.''
Sometimes they do. Sometimes they don't. (My son tells me that at
his school the student nickname for required reading ``Roll of
Thunder, Hear My Cry,'' the 1977 Newbery winner, was ROT.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen the market change dramatically,'' Todaro says. In
the early years there were lots of animal books (``Smoky,''
``Animal Family,'' ``Misty,'' ``Old Yeller,'') and more recently,
books written as journals. ``The awards reflect the best of what is
being written for children at that particular time. But in terms of
a life, some stand out more than others.''

 &HT;    Washington's passion powers `Hurricane' story
 &HT;    By Alison Macor
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ ``Here comes the story of the Hurricane,'' Bob
Dylan sings in the ballad he wrote for middleweight boxer Rubin
``Hurricane'' Carter when the African-American fighter was
wrongfully imprisoned in the 1960s for the murder of three people
in a New Jersey tavern.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Dylan no longer performs ``Hurricane'' in
concert, but actor Denzel Washington brings Carter's tale to the
screen with the same impassioned delivery that makes Dylan's song,
written to benefit Carter's legal defense, so mesmerizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hurricane'' also picks up where Dylan's song left off,
with Carter serving three consecutive life terms, writing his
autobiography ``The Sixteenth Round,'' enduring numerous twists and
turns as a result of ongoing legal battles and finally meeting
Lesra Martin (Vicellous Reon Shannon), the young man with whom
Carter would forge a profound and life-sustaining friendship.
</P>
<P>
   A substantial amount of this story takes place within the
confines of a jail cell as we watch Carter try to impose an
athlete's discipline upon the initial chaos and eventual monotony
that define prison life. Extended stays in solitary confinement eat
away at the boxer, producing wrenching scenes of Carter fighting
for his sanity. Veteran cinematographer Roger Deakins (``Dead Man
Walking,'' ``Fargo'') perfectly captures the mood of these prison
sequences with appropriately claustrophobic shots and a roving
camera that tracks Carter's internal journey from spiritual peace
to despair and back again.
</P>
<P>
   As Carter writes his autobiography, the story flashes back to
the events that led up to his arrest. While these scenes suggest
that Carter enjoyed a certain amount of respect and local celebrity
as a result of his promising boxing career, they also reveal the
prejudices that shadowed Carter's daily life, particularly as they
related to Vincent Della Pesca (Dan Hedaya), a corrupt New Jersey
detective.
</P>
<P>
   Della Pesca's presence in the story raises the issue of creative
license, which director Norman Jewison (``Moonstruck'') and
screenwriters Armyan Bernstein (``One From the Heart'') and Dan
Gordon (``Murder in the First'') make liberal use of in order to
dramatize certain events. Della Pesca is a fictional character who
represents many detectives and police officers associated with
Carter's ongoing case. In an otherwise restrained narrative, Della
Pesca's malevolence becomes a little too hokey, as does the
presence of Martin's do-gooder Canadian guardians, who assist their
charge in establishing contact with the imprisoned boxer.
</P>
<P>
   It's often refreshing to watch a movie, particularly one based
on actual events, in which the director and screenwriter allow a
certain amount of ambiguity to creep into characterizations and
actions within the story. For instance, ``The Hurricane'' suggests
ever so slightly that like any person, Carter had his vices, which
nicely humanizes the character without passing judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Other ambiguities are better left alone, such as the subtle
tension that runs between Carter and Martin's guardian Lisa Peters
(Deborah Kara Unger) later in the film. In reality, Carter and
Peters married after his release from prison, but in the film,
their interaction is reduced to a distracting blip in an otherwise
focused story.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers interested in seeing an accurate chronology of Carter's
life will find greater satisfaction in his autobiography and the
book ``Lazarus and the Hurricane,'' co-written by Sam Chaiton and
Terry Swinton (played in the film by Liev Schreiber and John
Hannah) about Martin's relationship with Carter and the Canadian
group's successful efforts to overturn his sentence.
</P>
<P>
   But for those viewers looking for a stirring, intense account of
one man's fight for justice, ``The Hurricane'' delivers.

 &HT;    `Mother' rescued by its mostly female cast
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ ``All About My Mother,'' Pedro Almodovar's big
sloppy kiss to womanhood, has been greeted with effusive valentines
from critics who commend Spain's bad-boy director for crystallizing
his old thematic passions with fresh, grown-up aplomb. Some have
called it his best film. It's not.
</P>
<P>
   There's no disputing the skill and feeling with which Almodovar
paints this emotionally charged comic melodrama, and he has few
peers when it comes to inspiring actresses to greatness.
``Mother,'' opening today at the Arbor, is an accomplished,
sometimes affecting work brimming with fine performances by an
(almost) all-female cast. There's a lot to admire. Almodovar fans
shouldn't miss it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``Mother'' demonstrates that Almodovar hasn't grown up much
at all. He still cleaves to a teen-age boy's view of women that's
awash in romanticized sexism. He worships women _ for their
indomitable spirit, their maternal virtue, their beauty and their
knack for camp. His idealism moves him so far as to see
transvestism as a sort of divine transfiguration, something perhaps
to be envied. (While he turns women into saints, at least he
doesn't turn them into Madonnas. The puckish filmmaker equally
adores angel-whores _ all manner of sassy misfit.)
</P>
<P>
   Maudlin nobility has little place in good art, and ``Mother''
suffers from Almodovar's woozy regard for his characters. It feels
like a mature work, but I think that's a response to how confident
a filmmaker Almodovar is. Unlike his ``Women on the Verge of a
Nervous Breakdown,'' ``Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!'' and 1998's
superior ``Live Flesh,'' the new movie never seems poised to spin
out of control, which would suit his florid fawning. It's more
contained, less intoxicating and, finally, one of his least
interesting films.
</P>
<P>
   We instantly know we've entered Almodovar terrain. ``Mother'' is
drenched in those famous Skittles primaries. The sun-splashed
apartments gleam with the rainbow-y innocence of a preschool. What
goes on inside, of course, are matters for a higher grade and
darker hue.
</P>
<P>
   Taking its title and thematic cues from ``All About Eve,'' that
catty celebration of femme fortitude and backstage bickering,
``Mother'' lurches from comic fizz to emotional arias that are
sometimes so wrenching they're hard to watch. Despite the grave
undertones, Almodovar is a feel-good artist, and the sorrow-pocked
laughs come liberally, justifying the movie's Day-Glo palette.
</P>
<P>
   When tragedy strikes a mother and her teen-age son, the
distraught mother, Manuela (Cecilia Roth, who's spectacular),
leaves her Madrid home for Barcelona, seeking her ex-husband to
tell him what has happened to the son he never knew. There she
reunites with an old friend, the haggard but saucy transvestite
prostitute Agrado (a tartly funny Antonia San Juan, whose face, an
asymmetrical jumble, looks like it was hit by an earthquake).
</P>
<P>
   As the women encounter a young pregnant nun (Penelope Cruz) and
a flinty but compassionate stage actress (a wonderfully seasoned
Marisa Paredes), we see how all of their lives are variously
entwined by coincidence and fate, forging among them a predestined
solidarity.
</P>
<P>
   Though bawdy humor and points of great poignancy dot the way,
the story's strained serendipity is a bit much. It's too humid and
precious to be taken seriously and denies us full emotional
involvement. Almodovar is working with shopworn archetypes _ the
broken mother, the kooky friend and the Bette Davis-esque theater
queen straight out of ``Eve'' _ and employs them in a schematic
melodrama that doesn't flow so much as clunk. (When a key character
dies, it's handled too hastily to register with us.)
</P>
<P>
   The wealth of roles women must assume to get through life's
hardships is Almodovar's central theme. Survival through cunning is
the province of women _ an idea embodied in the film's
transvestitactresses _ but the artifice is piled on so
gleefully, it's hard to get to the beating heart of the message.
Almodovar kills us with kitsch.

SCHWAB TO ACQUIRE U.S. TRUST IN FIRST BIG DEAL UNDER NEW BANK
LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the first big financial services deal since
Congress changed decades-old banking laws last fall, Charles Schwab
Corp. said Thursday that it would make a leap across both the
country and the investment spectrum to buy U.S. Trust Corp. for
$2.73 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Acquiring U.S. Trust, a New York-based private bank that caters
to the wealthiest Americans, would be a big step in the
transformation of San Francisco-based Schwab from a discount
brokerage firm for do-it-yourself investors to a full-service firm
that also offers personalized investment advice to customers
willing to pay for it. Schwab has been adding products and services
to its offerings in an attempt to distance itself from the dozens
of low-commission electronic brokerages that have sprung up in the
last several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers have been telling us they need more help with
their complex financial lives,'' said Charles R. Schwab, who
founded his company as one of the first discount brokerage firms
and built it into the nation's biggest electronic brokerage firm.
Now, he said, the richest of them will have access to services
provided by U.S. Trust, including estate planning, tax planning and
investment management.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab is paying a rich price, offering 3.427 of its highly
valued shares for each share of U.S. Trust. At Schwab's Wednesday
closing price of $37.625, that translates to about $129 a share, or
about 63 percent more than U.S. Trust's Wednesday closing price of
$78.875. That price includes about $150 million in cash and stock
options being offered to every employee of U.S. Trust to keep them
from leaving the company for two years after the transaction, which
is expected to close by July.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Schwab fell about $3 a share Thursday morning but
recovered after analysts were briefed on the deal and closed up
$2.875, to at $40.50. U.S. Trust's shares soared $54.125, to $133.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Trust, with $80 billion is assets, is small compared with
Schwab. Schwab took in about $107 billion in new assets last year,
and now has more than $700 billion.

 &HT;    A poignant struggle revives a life `Interrupted'By Alison Macor
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _The title of ``Girl, Interrupted,'' the moving
film based on Susanna Kaysen's memoir about her experiences in a
psychiatric hospital, comes from Dutch artist Jan Vermeer's
painting, ``Girl Interrupted at Her Music.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaysen reveals this with two separate anecdotes, and through her
words we understand the changes she has undergone between the time
she first saw the painting as a 14-year-old and when she viewed it
as an adult after spending nearly two years in McLean Hospital in
Massachusetts in the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The anecdotes are absent from James Mangold's film, but the
transformation comes across quite powerfully in Winona Ryder's
portrayal of Kaysen. Ryder subtly conveys that a change has taken
place from when we first see her heading in a cab toward the
imposing brick hospital (named Claymoore in the movie) and at the
end of the film, when she is riding away in the same taxi.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest challenge for Mangold and co-screenwriters
Lisa Loomer and Anna Hamilton Phelan was adapting Kaysen's episodic
autobiography into three acts. The movie occasionally suffers
because of this, particularly during dramatic moments manufactured
for climactic purposes. In the film, Susanna becomes more of a
goal-oriented heroine and less of an enlightened voice leading us
through her sometimes hellish but often poignant experiences.
</P>
<P>
   And yet ``Girl, Interrupted'' effectively preserves some of the
book's tone through its creative use of flashbacks, linked to the
present by sound bridges that match snippets of dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   After the movie begs off its interminable close-ups of Ryder's
huge dark eyes, we can appreciate her intense but restrained
performance. After attempting suicide with a bottle of aspirin and
a vodka chaser, Susanna's introduction to the other young women at
Claymoore is frightening enough to emphasize the troubling limbo
she occupies, while also revealing that she could be worse off
emotionally.
</P>
<P>
   At Claymoore we meet Lisa, the ward's most intriguing resident
and possibly its most far gone. Played with characteristic passion
by Angelina Jolie, Lisa is not unlike the charismatic R.P. McMurphy
that Jack Nicholson made famous in ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest.''
</P>
<P>
   Mangold makes good use of the movie's supporting cast to offer a
more nuanced, gently humorous portrait of the hospital. Worth
noting is Brittany Murphy's Daisy, an incest survivor who collects
chicken carcasses and talks endlessly about the small apartment her
father has purchased for her with its one bedroom and _ the most
Freudian of slips _ an ``eat-in chicken.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaysen's memoir begins with the observation that it's easy to
wind up in a place like Claymoore. ``Girl, Interrupted'' shows us
how, with feeling.

A RICHER MIX OF CHIPS HELPS INTEL EXCEED EXPECTED PROFIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ After three quarters of results that
disappointed investors, Intel Corp. on Thursday posted
fourth-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall Street's expectations
because of strong demand for personal computers and a shift toward
higher-performance chips with better profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of the company soared in after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter, Intel reported net income of $2.11 billion, or
61 cents a diluted share, up 2 percent from $2.06 billion, or 59
cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue rose 8
percent, to $8.21 billion from $7.61 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding charges and costs related to acquisitions, profit was
$2.4 billion, or 69 cents a share, up 15 percent from $2.08
billion, or 60 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier.
Analysts had expected Intel to earn 63 cents a share, according to
First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks company earnings.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, Intel had earnings of $7.31 billion, or $2.11 a
diluted share, up 21 percent from $6.07 billion, or $1.73 a share,
in 1998. Revenue rose 12 percent, to $29.39 billion from $26.27
billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Before Intel reported its results, its shares fell 18.75 cents,
to $91.0625. But in after-hours trading, they rose as high as
$96.125.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's strong results defied some predictions that the company
would fall short again because of an inability to deliver chips in
adequate numbers. That speculation gained credence earlier this
month when Gateway said its earnings would fall short, in large
part because the computer maker could not get enough chips from
Intel. Gateway subsequently said it would begin buying some chips
from Intel's archrival, Advanced Micro Devices Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was actually a quarter that was just as solid and a little
bit better than we expected,'' Andy Bryant, Intel's chief financial
officer, said in an interview. While he would not comment
specifically on Gateway, Bryant said, ``From our point of view, we
met all of our product commitments to customers during the
quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant said Intel expected the favorable market for PC's to
continue this quarter but revenue would be down slightly from the
fourth quarter because of seasonal trends.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest quarter, analysts said, Intel was faced with
supply constraints and effectively shifted production to
higher-performance chips from those that Gateway wanted. The
strength of the overall PC market, and Intel's dominance within
that market, meant Intel was able to sell these higher-priced chips
and reap higher revenues and profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fourth quarter for Intel was about solid PC demand and
Intel's ability to drive a richer mix of products,'' said Mark
Edelstone, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``I think
they had to struggle to keep up with demand and in that kind of
environment you're going to try to manage your mix.''

TAKING ACTION TO FIND HER OWN FEMALE IDENTITY  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 16)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 Michael Rush's book ``New Media in Late 20th-Century Art'' was just
published by Thames and Hudson.  
 By MICHAEL RUSH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some 20 years before Karen Finley smeared herself with chocolate
to express her outrage over the brutal treatment of women's bodies
and 30 years before Eve Ensler started delivering her ``Vagina
Monologues,'' Valie Export cut the crotch out of her jeans and
walked into a Munich art-film house known for showing sexually
explicit films. Parading up and down the aisles in a performance
action titled ``Genitalpanik,'' she dared the cowering, mostly male
devotees to look at a real body.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 1950s, Ms. Export has been challenging images of
the female body in media through her own prodigious output of
videos, films, performances, photographs, installations,
documentaries and writings.
</P>
<P>
   Represented in scores of exhibitions in Europe since the 1970s,
the 59-year-old artist is only now receiving her first solo
exhibition in the United States, from Tuesday through Feb. 27 at
the Goldie Paley Gallery of the Moore College of Art and Design in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Linz, Austria, Ms. Export arrived in Vienna at the
height of what has been called Viennese Actionism, a 1960s movement
of radical performance artists (Otto Muehl, Gunter Brus, Hermann
Nitsch, Rudolf Schwarzkogler) known for graphic body mutilations
and for protests that landed some of them in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Repulsed by war, resenting the continued reverberations of
Nazism and rejecting the lionization of Modernist artists, the
movement sought to insult the pretensions of art and society
through brutal performances that unleashed unconscious impulses.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ms. Export was not technically a part of the group, it
was in this environment that she developed her own brand of what
she called Feminist Actionism, partly in response to the male
Viennese gang of four's often blatant misogyny. ``All my works are
self-portraits,'' she says, including one of her first ones, the
changing of her name from Waltraud Hollinger to Valie Export in
1967. ``I no longer wanted the name of my father or my former
husband; I wanted my own, easily recognizable name, which could
also be a logo for my art.''
</P>
<P>
   So she made a nickname out of Waltraud (Valie) and appropriated
the name of a popular cigarette brand, Export, as the ``perfect
expression of my desire to export my inner ideas outside into the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Export, now a professor of multimedia performance at the
University of Media Art in Cologne, Germany, relates the
development of her early work to the international style of art she
encountered at an exhibition in Sweden in the mid-'60s, where she
saw performances by John Cage, artworks by Arnulf Rainer and the
Fluxus artist Dick Higgins, and the avant-garde films of Michael
Snow and Hollis Frampton.
</P>
<P>
   She mentions only male artists, but only because there were so
few female models at the time. She and a loose multinational
consortium including Carolee Schneemann, Adrian Piper and Joan
Jonas from the United States, Niki de Saint Phalle (France), Ulrike
Rosenbach (Germany), Friederike Pezold (Austria) and Lygia Clark
(Brazil), to name a few, were the pioneers who inspired current
artists like Janine Antoni, Pipilotti Rist, Mona Hatoum and Zhang
Huan.
</P>
<P>
   What's striking about Ms. Export, in addition to her longevity
in what has often been a hostile art environment, is her
extraordinary diversity. Though feminism was her springboard, her
artistic investigations reveal a deep knowledge of psychoanalysis,
linguistics, literature (especially Gertrude Stein, Virginia Woolf,
Antonin Artaud and Samuel Beckett) and the history of art,
expressed in a dizzying collection of work in many mediums.
</P>
<P>
   Her early photographic work (several samples of which will be on
display in a separate exhibition from Jan. 23 through March 4 at
Klemens Gasser and Tanja Grunert Gallery in Manhattan reveals a
keen interest in conceptual relationships between architecture and
the body. With the eye of a Berenice Abbott, she photographed
trains, street corners and edges of buildings, and injected her own
particular sensibility by putting her body on the ledge of a
staircase or curved around the corner of a street, as if to assert
the self in an anonymous urban environment.
</P>
<P>
   Highlights of the 30-year retrospective at Moore College are 60
posters made in conjunction with the ``Genitalpanik'' action, a
24-monitor video installation of sewing-machine needles pumping up
and down, and Ms. Export's award-winning experimental film,
``Syntagma'' (1983), containing a kaleidoscopic array of images
that explore a woman's identity.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by Elsa Long-hauser, the gallery's director, the
exhibition is part of Moore's International Discovery series, a
biannual survey of work from lesser-known international artists.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why she thought Ms. Export was so little recognized
here, Ms. Long-hauser said her situation was not unique: ``If
you're not part of a fashionable trajectory, for whatever reason,
the system can pass you by.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In front of a lush, eye-popping backdrop of the Times
Square New Year's Eve celebration, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani delivered
a theatrical State of the City address on Thursday that was both a
reprise of what he considers his greatest triumphs and an effort to
impose his legacy on New York City far into the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   The speech often sounded like a long goodbye, but at other times
like the first words of Giuliani's undeclared U.S. Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be my last State of the City speech,'' Giuliani
said at the beginning, before a packed City Council chamber of
invited supporters and television cameras. He concluded nearly an
hour and 40 minutes later with a wistful ``I'm never going to have
a better job,'' then added, ``I've loved it tremendously.''
</P>
<P>
   Should Giuliani defeat his expected Senate opponent, Hillary
Rodham Clinton, he will have only a year left as mayor. If he
loses, he will have only two years left, because of term limits.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani made some of his most striking proposals in education,
which is also his most vulnerable area with voters. His plans
included the proposed sale of 110 Livingston St., the Board of
Education's legendary and ramshackle headquarters in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   At first, many listeners thought he was joking, but he meant it
seriously, even as he made light of his remarks last year that the
Board of Education should be ``blown up.'' His aides acknowledged
later that the board would have to approve the sale.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said that for now he wanted to move the board _ his
ultimate dream is to abolish it entirely _ to a more modern,
``smart'' building. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani also made one of his most aggressive attacks yet on the
city's teachers, saying they do not deserve an across-the-board pay
raise in coming negotiations, but rather salary increases based on
merit.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor particularly singled out the teachers' union, which is
expected to support Mrs. Clinton in the Senate race, for what he
called its ``job protection system.''
</P>
<P>
   He added with extravagant disgust and a touch of bitter
amusement that children who attended the city's summer schools
actually saw their reading scores decline.
</P>
<P>
   This was the fourth year that the mayor dispensed with a lectern
and teleprompter and instead delivered his address ambling around a
small stage without notes.
</P>
<P>
   In the days before the speech, the mayor prepared for the event
with Elliot Cuker, an acting coach. While it made for a far more
watchable delivery, the textless presentation did cause the mayor
to forget a major proposal his aides had disclosed to reporters on
Wednesday: $2 billion in commercial and business tax cuts over the
next four years.
</P>
<P>
   After concluding with a plea that the residents of New York
``should never give in and, please God, we should never turn back
to the way we were,'' Giuliani suddenly came back to the stage and
announced that Peter F. Vallone, the City Council speaker, had just
asked him what had happened to the tax cuts. Giuliani announced
them quickly, then began an encore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The art of leadership in this city is saying,'' Giuliani said,
``yes, it can be done in the greatest city in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani neglected few areas of his administration in a
sprawling list of plans for what he described as a city enjoying a
renaissance brought on by him.
</P>
<P>
   Although many ideas were reiterations of previous plans nicely
dressed for the occasion, and most need approval from either the
City Council, the State Legislature or the Port Authority, three
new proposals stood out: a state-of-the-art laboratory for DNA
testing of people suspected of crimes; an ``aggressive driving''
program that would take away the cars of people arrested for not
just drunken driving but reckless driving; and the addition of up
to 200 heat-seeking infrared cameras to help firefighters determine
the source of a blaze.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor also proposed extensive redevelopment projects around
the city.

 &HT;    Pitcher gets heavyweight advice
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Baseball officials may not yet have decided what to do
with Braves relief pitcher John Rocker. But they can be assured he
had his own private diversity training Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The same day the Atlanta chapter of the NAACP spoke out against
Rocker, he sat cross-legged and wide-eyed in a chair in the living
room of Andrew Young, one of the most influential leaders in the
city's, and nation's, civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, who made millions of enemies by spouting inflammatory
remarks to a Sports Illustrated reporter last month, took comfort
in Young's reassurances. He also took advice from the former
Atlanta mayor on how to deal with hatred.
</P>
<P>
   And that was only the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   The day after Rocker broke his silence in a nationally telecast
interview with Peter Gammons of ESPN, the man now labeled a racist
by much of the nation spent the afternoon seeking and receiving
support from Young, being pleasantly surprised by a visit from
former NBA star Isiah Thomas and facing Hank Aaron, the home run
king who'd spoken out adamantly against Rocker when the Sports
Illustrated article was released.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker walked out of Young's Atlanta home Thursday afternoon and
headed to Aaron's BMW dealership in south Atlanta, clutching a copy
of Young's book, ``An Easy Burden,'' about the civil rights
movement. Inside the front cover, in Young's handwriting, were the
words: ``John Rocker, Welcome to the struggle. Keep faith, Andrew
Young.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Atlanta way has been, we do make mistakes, none of us is
perfect, but we've got to learn to live together,'' Young said.
``Nobody's going anywhere. When we make mistakes, we help each
other up.''
</P>
<P>
   Young had counseled Rocker in an Atlanta Journal-Constitution
editorial, which caught the attention of Macon Mayor Jack Ellis,
who had offered Rocker his support. Ellis contacted Young and that
set off an afternoon of discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker met Ellis and his father, Jake Rocker, in a KFC parking
lot off the freeway in South Atlanta and they drove over to Young's
home.
</P>
<P>
   Jake Rocker had stopped on the way from Macon to buy Rocker a
foot-long turkey sub sandwich. By the time Jake Rocker left to
drive back to Macon after 6 p.m. on Thursday evening, the sandwich
was still in the front seat of his sports-utility vehicle,
untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Young greeted Rocker and company at his back door, ushered them
into his living room and got to the point quickly after exchanging
handshakes and hellos.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I see happening is something I guess all of us has to
learn, and that's you can't let people make you mad,'' Young said.
``My dad always said if you lose your temper in a fight, you'll
always lose the fight. The main thing you did was you let him get
your goat and let him get you ...
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can stay in control of your temper, you can stay in
control of your situation. I think you made a mistake. I don't
think anyone has a right to condemn you for that. I don't think
there's anyone that can say he lost his temper so he doesn't have a
right to play. I think if you keep losing your temper, you won't be
able to play. I think that's what New York fans do to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of what Young had to say centered on how Rocker should
handle himself from here.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be picketing,'' Young said. ``Martin Luther King, when
he was picketed, he never tried to speak to them directly. In his
mind, he'd say, `I'm going to convince those people in my speech
that what they have on their signs is not true.'''
</P>
<P>
   Young told Rocker stories from when Young lived in New York and
had a New York reporter say to him: ``You don't think the South
African government is legitimate, do you?'' Young said he responded
``no'' and the headlines in the next morning's paper were ``Young
attacks South African government.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to learn the ways of dealing with the press,''
Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Young suggested Rocker enlist the support of his teammates who
are minorities, encouraged Rocker's efforts to contact his
teammates and urged him to let his actions speak louder than any
words. He applauded the fact that Rocker was playing in a celebrity
softball tournament this weekend in Miami, with former Brave Dennis
Martinez, to benefit hurricane relief for Nicaragua. Rocker also
played in the event last year.
</P>
<P>
   After about 20 minutes, they were greeted by Thomas, now a
businessman interested in creating a minor league basketball league
with a team in Rocker's hometown. Thomas was on his way to Macon
when he found out Rocker was meeting with Young in Atlanta and
asked if he could come by.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who got into a racial public relations mess himself when
he made a disparaging remark about Larry Bird, dropped in, along
with former Atlanta Hawk Michael Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas greeted Rocker with his patented perfect smile and reeled
him in from a handshake to a bear hug. They immediately fell into
conversation about a common friend in the minor leagues and about
sports. As the conversation moved into the sitting area, Young
turned it to more serious topics. Thomas chipped in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a good opportunity for you,'' Thomas told
Rocker. ``You have the opportunity to really talk about how
diversity and inclusiveness is what sports are all about.''
</P>
<P>
   After about 20 to 30 minutes, Thomas got up to leave, first
stopping to talk with Jake Rocker. Thomas hugged the older man and,
as he did, said, ``There's a bigger fight to fight than this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker and his father and Young then left for Aaron's BMW
dealership, where Aaron and Rocker spoke privately for nearly 25
minutes in Aaron's glassed-in office in the showroom.
</P>
<P>
   As members of the news media multiplied outside the doors of the
dealership, Rocker and Aaron came out of the office and went into a
conference room, joining a larger group that included Young, his
publicist Lee Echols and Jake Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly another half-hour, the men discussed Rocker's
situation and what his approach should be. Several times during the
discussion they glanced at a reporter and asked that certain
comments be off the record.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Jake Rocker described how he and his wife, Judy,
had struggled with this situation. As he spoke, John Rocker put his
hands to his head, and Aaron nodded without speaking.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron told Rocker a story of taking abuse from a fan during his
minor league days in Macon, where Aaron broke the color barrier in
the South Atlantic League. He told Rocker how he always tried to
keep his reactions to himself, to lean on his teammates, to laugh
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that I'm giving him advice in doing is in
trying to get his life back together again,'' Aaron said after the
meeting. ``What he said was very offensive. And I told him it's
something that it's hard for me to forgive. But I'm glad I had the
chance to talk with (him). ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Who am I not to forgive? I don't mind forgiving. But I want
people to understand if I did something wrong, then admit it.''
</P>
<P>
   Did Rocker admit it to Aaron?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Aaron said. ``He said, 'I was wrong, what I said.' But
he doesn't know how to say it. And the way he said it on ESPN with
Peter Gammons was not the way to say it. He just put more fuel on
the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron said Rocker was much more convincing in person, and that
he believed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to learn more about him, but I do forgive him,''
Aaron said. When asked whether he should be playing for the Braves
this season, Aaron said, ``I didn't say that. I don't know what
they should do with him.''
</P>
<P>
   During the meeting, Jake Rocker told Aaron about how good it
made him feel when a group of school boys, all black, had waved at
John as he turned the corner driving his silver Corvette, with
Andrew Young riding shotgun, on their way to the dealership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad, I think it was my car,'' Rocker said.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker may or may not be a racist, but he is a realist. Time
will tell what others decide.

BOY WHO KILLED GETS 7 YEARS AS JUDGE CRITICIZES LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs 5th graf to note Nathanel had spent 26 months in juvenile
detention and his behavior had improved.) 
 (bl) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTIAC, Mich. _ A state judge here ruled Thursday that the
youngest American ever charged and convicted as an adult of murder
will serve a seven-year sentence at a maximum-security juvenile
detention center and then be released. The unexpectedly lenient
sentence stunned prosecutors and disappointed lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland County Circuit Court Judge Eugene Arthur Moore rejected
prosecutors' request that Nathaniel Abraham, 13, who was convicted
of a murder committed when he was 11, be sentenced to serve
additional time in an adult prison unless he has clearly been
rehabilitated by the age of 21.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that society has leaned too far toward punishment instead
of rehabilitation, Moore also read from the bench a ringing
denunciation of the national trend over the last decade toward
trying and sentencing younger and younger children as adults.
</P>
<P>
   Moore called for changes in the 3-year-old law that makes it
possible for children of any age to be tried as adults in Michigan.
He called the law ``fundamentally flawed'' and suggested that the
state return to its practice before 1997 of reserving such trials
and sentences for children who are at least 14 when they commit
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Legislature has responded to juvenile criminal activity
not by helping to prevent and rehabilitate, but rather by treating
juveniles more like adults,'' Moore said in his sentencing opinion.
``The real solution is to prevent an adult criminal population ever
coming into existence.''
</P>
<P>
   State lawmakers across the country have been rewriting juvenile
justice codes in response to some constituents' demands that they
get tough on young offenders accused of terrible crimes. But
critics contend, and Moore agreed Thursday, that the juvenile
justice system has far more success at rehabilitation than the
adult correctional system. Nathaniel has spent 26 months in a
temporary juvenile detention center and while he was involved in
altercations at first, his behavior has improved, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan House Speaker Charles Perricone, a Republican who
helped write the state's strict juvenile justice law, said changes
in the law were unlikely as long as Republicans controlled the
state's House, Senate and the governor's mansion. ``At the end of
the day, someone, and I had hoped it would be the judge, should
stand up and ask one simple question: does this individual present
a danger to society?'' Perricone said in a telephone interview.
``We don't need judges on a soap box. We need judges who will
uphold the law.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John Engler opposes revising the law, particularly because
the state's prosecutors and judges endorsed it in 1996, said Susan
Shafer, a spokeswoman for the governor.
</P>
<P>
   By coincidence, Moore was the president of the Michigan Probate
Judges Association when the law was adopted, and the association
endorsed the law then. Lisa Halushka, the family division chief in
the Oakland County prosecutor's office who was the lead prosecutor
in Nathaniel's case, said that because of this history, she was
especially stunned and disappointed by Thursday's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has left me speechless,'' she said. ``As soon as I got the
impression he would go straight juvenile, I thought: Michigan
Probate Judges Association.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel faces a pretrial hearing next week on a separate
charge of breaking into a garage shortly before the slaying. But he
had never been convicted of a crime before he went out on a
hillside on the evening of Oct. 19, 1997, and used a borrowed,
.22-caliber rifle with its gunstock missing to shoot Ronnie Greene
Jr., who was 18 and a stranger, once in the back of the head at a
range of more than 200 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Fieger, Nathaniel's lead lawyer, said that if Nathaniel
was guilty of anything, it was reckless use of a firearm. But
prosecutors presented evidence that Nathaniel had prepared for the
slaying by shooting at balloons, and had later boasted about the
killing to friends at his elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   Moore has declined all interviews during the trial, and did so
again Thursday. He has handled Nathaniel's case from the beginning,
and granted prosecutors permission to try Nathaniel as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   Under Michigan law, Moore had three sentencing options. He could
have sentenced Nathaniel to eight to 25 years in adult prison; time
in a juvenile detention center followed by a second sentencing
hearing between his 18th and 21st birthdays to decide on additional
time in an adult prison if he had not been fully rehabilitated; and
time only in a juvenile detention center. Prosecutors, who have
received some criticism here for harshness, recommended the second
option.
</P>
<P>
   At least 44 states have adopted new juvenile justice laws since
1992 that allow more children to be tried as adults.

 &HT;    Rocker gains some player support
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Both drafted in the summer of 1994, they took almost
all the steps together, from West Palm Beach, Fla.; Eugene and
Macon, Ga., and Durham, N.C. John Rocker and George Lombard were
teammates in the Atlanta Braves' minor league system for much of
the past decade. As the Braves' closer attempts to extricate
himself from the mess he created, Lombard has six years experience
by which to judge him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell people John is out there,'' Lombard said Thursday.
``He's got that closer mentality and he's a crazy guy. He has been
since that first day I met him down in West Palm. But I mean, he's
from a good family. I've spent the night over at his house, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Lombard, who has resumed workouts in town after a month in the
Venezuelan winter league, is one of the few teammates Rocker has
reached to discuss his racially charged comments in Sports
Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first comment to him, when he called, was `Well, John, you
know how to keep yourself in the media.' That was the ice
breaker,'' Lombard said. ``But I told him he's got himself in a
little bit of a hole here. That was right before he sat down with
ESPN and he hopes this will help him out.''
</P>
<P>
   So, did it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was definitely in favor of John,'' Lombard said.
``I thought Peter Gammons did a good job helping him out. After
some of the things that were said, it's going to be hard to win
back a lot of the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching Rocker's first public appearance from his home in El
Centro, Calif., relief pitcher Rudy Seanez took special interest.
During his rookie season, the two filled the same role as setup
men. Seanez has spoken with him twice, but not since his first TV
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it went OK,'' Seanez said. ``It's like anything. You
can't satisfy everyone and I think no matter what he does, there
are still going to be some people questioning him. He maybe could
have made some things more clear. But that's Rocker.''
</P>
<P>
   While some Braves initially doubted Rocker's future with the
club, Seanez already anticipates Rocker's opportunity to meet with
the entire team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope it all gets done in one shot,'' Seanez said.
``Have a closed-door meeting with all the players and get everyone
in there and take however long it takes to get it all out. Then
once those doors open back up, that's it. Get on with the
business.''

 PONTIAC, Mich.: as adults. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In one nationally publicized case, Kip Kinkel was sentenced in
November in Portland, Ore., to more than 111 years in prison
without possibility of parole for having fatally shot his parents
and two fellow high school students when he was 15 years old.
</P>
<P>
   There has been only one other case in Oakland County of
prosecutors' recommending a combination of juvenile and adult
crime. Moore also presided in that recent case, which involved a
home invasion by another offender who committed the crime at the
age of 16, Mrs. Halushka said. The offender, who was white,
received a six-month sentence in a county jail after he reached the
age of 18 in a juvenile detention center without showing that he
had been rehabilitated, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fieger welcomed Moore's decision, but said he would proceed with
his plan to appeal the jury's verdict last November. Nathaniel, who
wore a brown and gray shirt with khaki trousers, was expressionless
during the sentencing, but another of his lawyers, Daniel Bagdade,
said he had his hand on Nathaniel's shoulder and could feel his
client trembling.
</P>
<P>
   After the trial, Bagdade said, ``Nate looked up at me and the
first words out of his mouth were, `What happened?''' Nathaniel
will turn 14 next week, but psychologists testified at his trial
that he was mentally and emotionally impaired.
</P>
<P>
   Greene's relatives had varying reactions to the verdict. His
grandmother, Joanne Hayden, reacted calmly when the sentence was
read but a minute later leaned against a wall outside the courtroom
and began weeping while loudly crying, ``Oh, Ronnie, Oh, Ronnie,
Oh, my boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Hayden, the dead man's uncle, said he believed Nathaniel
should have received a combination of a juvenile and adult
sentence. Hayden also said that Michigan's law on young offenders
should remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel is black, as was Greene, and the case here has drawn
national attention from civil rights activists. Fieger and these
activists have contended that Nathaniel would have been treated
differently in this mostly white county if he were also white _ a
contention that Mrs. Halushka rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred protesters showed up for the hearing, with many
of them standing in wind-driven snow outside the courtroom, beating
drums and chanting slogans like ``Nathaniel, we love you.'' One of
the protest's leaders, the Rev. Al Sharpton of New York, said after
the sentencing that while he was pleased that Nathaniel would not
be sent to prison, he still believed that Nathaniel should have
been acquitted and that Michigan's juvenile justice laws should be
rewritten.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge said some strong and courageous things _ he
convicted the system but he incarcerated Nathaniel,'' Sharpton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, 64, has a national reputation as an experienced and
respected juvenile court judge. He was first elected as a juvenile
court judge in a countywide race in 1966, and has won every
reelection campaign since then, usually running unopposed; his
current, six-year term will not expire until the end of 2004. Moore
succeeded his father, Judge Arthur Eugene Moore, on the juvenile
court bench, and his father's portrait still hangs in the county
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Moore ``leans toward more lenient sentences,'' Mrs. Halushka
said. But in this heavily Republican county on the northern edge of
Detroit, the judge makes occasional appearances at Republican
fund-raisers, she said, while adding that elections for judges are
non-partisan and Moore ``is not super-political.''

GIULIANI VOWS TO SEIZE VEHICLES OF RECKLESS DRIVERS
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By C.J. CHIVERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beginning next week, people accused of driving recklessly in New
York City will face misdemeanor charges and the forfeiture of their
cars, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown, which the mayor announced in his State of the
City address, will be modeled after the city's policy of seizing
the vehicles of people arrested on charges of driving while drunk,
a controversial practice that has withstood court challenges so
far. The mayor said the expanded effort was necessary because
traffic deaths had increased sharply in the city last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get arrested for reckless driving to the point where we
charge you with a misdemeanor, we're going to take your automobile
from you,'' the mayor said. ``And we're going to take it from you
because we're entitled to it and because it'll remind you that this
is important. This kills people. It also kills you.''
</P>
<P>
   To enforce the new policy, the Police Department has equipped 25
patrol cars with front- and rear-mounted video cameras, which will
be used to record speeding cars as they approach and then pass the
police.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir said that officers would be
posted in problem areas, and that the videotapes they recorded
would be used to buttress cases in court. He declined to disclose
any of the crackdown's planned sites.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the program, officers will be instructed to look for
indicators of danger when considering whether to arrest drivers or
merely give them a traffic citation.
</P>
<P>
   The threshold will be crossed, Safir said, any time a vehicle is
seen performing three dangerous moves or moving at twice the posted
speed limit. For the purpose of enforcement, reckless moves will
include weaving in and out of lanes, following vehicles too closely
or entering shoulders to pass other vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Reading from a state law that defines reckless driving as
driving that ``unreasonably interferes with the free and proper use
of a public highway'' or that ``unreasonably endangers'' others,
the commissioner acknowledged that the law gave the police much
latitude. But he said enforcement would be reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't going to necessarily seize a vehicle that is doing
30 miles per hour in a 15-mile zone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Giuliani's policy drew a strong response from the
New York Civil Liberties Union. Norman Siegel, the organization's
director, said it was ``unfair and excessive'' and would probably
lead to lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to challenge initiatives that basically hang
you first and try you later,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While civil libertarians objected to the seizures, the
announcement was praised by advocates for walkers and bikers who
have long complained that the city was too soft on reckless
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the police truly target driving that endangers pedestrians
and cyclists, this could start a renaissance for nonmotorized
travel in New York,'' said Charles Komanoff, who heads Right of
Way, a pedestrian rights group. ``Maybe ordinary New Yorkers, not
just daredevils, will finally be able to ride a bike and feel
safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Police were unable to provide fatality statistics related to
reckless driving, but said that even though alcohol-related
fatalities fell, the total number of traffic deaths in the city
rose, to 416 last year from 367 in 1998.

 LISTEN UP!: Startup guides fans through the wide world of
online  music  
 (Eds.: With MUSIC-LISTEN-HOW and MUSIC-LISTEN-PICKS)  
 By JAMES SULLIVAN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO &LR;   &LR; _ The urbane, exposed-brick offices of the San
Francisco startup Listen.com are decorated with kitsch. Action
figures brandish swords and stun guns atop computer terminals. A
Village People eight-track tape lies on one desktop; a Sammy Davis
Jr. LP is lovingly displayed on another.
</P>
<P>
   For the youthful employees of Listen.com, the action figures
represent the need for lightning-quick reflexes in the brave new
cartoon world of dot-coms. The vintage records and eight-tracks, on
the other hand, represent creaky ancient history.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the future of recorded music appears to be in the
online download of music files _ MP3s, or some similar digital
distribution system. In less time than it takes to make and break a
teen pop sensation, Listen.com has established itself as the
pre-eminent authority on the music industry's latest wrinkle.
</P>
<P>
   Listen.com is a sort of Yellow Pages of online music, with links
to existing music files that it updates and reviews daily. The
company, which started its Web site in June, has already amassed a
directory of nearly 40,000 artists who have songs available online.
</P>
<P>
   Stamping itself as the only authority on the subject, the
company has just released ``Listen Picks,'' a CD compilation of
some of the staff's favorite downloadable songs, by established
bands (Pavement, Public Enemy, Kelly Willis) and relative unknowns
(Astronaut Wife, Crooked Fingers, Supreme Beings of Leisure).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a record store _ we're the cool guys in the record
store who know where everything is,'' says Tim Quirk, former leader
of the band Too Much Joy and a free-lance writer who has gone
``straight'' as a Listen.com reviews editor.
</P>
<P>
   The company, still privately held, has already taken on $35
million from key investors such as Sony Music. Chris Blackwell,
founder of Island Records, recently joined the board of directors.
The company has business partnerships with just about every online
music site of note, including MP3.com, Emusic, Liquid Audio and
Riffage.com.
</P>
<P>
   The company operates as a ``portal point,'' like Yahoo, with
revenue generated from ad sales and referral fees paid by its
partner music sites. A former publisher of Us magazine was recently
hired as vice president of sales.
</P>
<P>
   Since June, Listen.com has grown from a few dozen employees to
more than 100. Based on the city's Potrero Hill, along a stretch of
Web-related music offices now dubbed Audio Alley, it is preparing
to expand into an adjacent building, a former metal-bending plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a compound pretty soon,'' says Editor in
Chief Nick Tangborn.
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen-style office space is a lot quieter than might be
expected. Staff members are buried in computer terminals and
headphones, each listening to the latest download in his ``queue''
and pecking out reviews.
</P>
<P>
   With 20 reviewers and 35 total editorial staffers _ many of them
DJs or members of local bands such as I Am Spoonbender, Mover and
Blue Sky Roadster _ the company says it might have the largest
full-time music editorial team anywhere. (Music magazines such as
Rolling Stone have large teams of editors, of course, but use
mostly free-lance writers.)
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Bardeen, a 26-year-old reviewer in braids and stocking
feet, has a reputation as one of the company's sassier writers.
``We try to give the music a fair assessment, not just spiral into
gratuitous violence on the music,'' she says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Among her recent discoveries: the Egyptian singing star Oum
Kaltoum (``nobody realized she was basically the main classical
Arabic singer'') and the Drs. Clarke, a pair of rapping brothers
who have recorded a whole album of songs about their medical
specialty, asthma. ``That was amazing,'' says Bardeen. ``Totally
brilliant. I think everybody appreciates the absurdity of some of
this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The links on Listen.com can be organized in several ways _ by
genre (rock/alternative, easy listening, ``darkside'' electronic),
by established artists (``Big Shots''), by critics' picks.
</P>
<P>
   Bardeen says the directory might eventually break down listings
in other ways _ by geography, for instance: ``If you wanted to find
fellow yodelers in Oklahoma, you could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   There aren't any yodelers from Oklahoma among the Listen.com
staff, but there certainly are young men and women with a variety

seem. ``Players'' are software products that enable your computer
to recognize an MP3 file and play it back. Many are available free
for download, including WinAmp, MusicMatch, Microsoft Media and
Real Jukebox.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to locate an MP3 file of a song you want to
hear. Once you've downloaded the song, just open the downloaded
file on the player.

 WASHINGTON: fee-for-service program.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This idea is somewhat similar to the president's proposal and to
a bill introduced in August by Sens. Olympia J. Snowe, R-Maine, and
Ron Wyden, D-Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Binder acknowledged that the government would need to set ``some
minimum standards'' for such drug benefits. ``Any company that
wanted to provide services within those ground rules could apply to
do so,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Picking up this theme, Gilmartin said: ``One could envision a
drug-only insurance option, with plans competing against one
another. The important principle is that these insurance plans
would compete for Medicare beneficiaries, not for a contract with
the federal government. That's a key distinction.''
</P>
<P>
   The new stance was prompted, in part, by the comments of Clinton
administration officials who said last month that the industry
would bring price controls on itself if it kept resisting public
demands for Medicare drug coverage. After reading those remarks,
the executives said, they were shaken, but also saw some hopeful
signs, and they requested a White House meeting to search for
common ground.
</P>
<P>
   Drug company executives said they had begun asking the same
question as Clinton: Why are they working frantically to develop
great new medicines for the elderly if many of the intended
beneficiaries cannot get or afford them?
</P>
<P>
   Under the president's proposal, Medicare would pay half of a
beneficiary's drug expenses, up to certain limits. The maximum
federal payment would start at $1,000 a year and would rise
gradually to $2,500 in 2008.
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies infuriated the White House last year when they
attacked Clinton's proposal in a series of television and newspaper
advertisements featuring an arthritic Medicare beneficiary named
Flo. The advertisements suggested that the Clinton plan would put
big government inside the family medicine chest and force all the
elderly into a government-run insurance plan.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Clinton complained that the industry had blocked
congressional action on prescription drugs by spending ``millions
of dollars on an all-out media campaign filled with flat-out
falsehoods.'' He ordered ``a sweeping study'' to document the
impact of high drug prices on the elderly. Democrats say the study
will provide them with ammunition for daily denunciations of the
drug industry.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmartin said that if Flo reappeared on television, she would
not just criticize Clinton's plan. ``It's important now for Flo to
also be for something positive,'' Gilmartin said.

 McCAIN CHIDES BUSH OVER BALLOT CHALLENGE  
 (bl)  
 By JODI WILGOREN   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEENE, N.H. _ Invoking images of communist repression, Sen. John
McCain on Thursday called upon Texas Gov. George W. Bush to stop
his supporters in New York state from challenging McCain's petition
to appear on New York presidential primary ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that New York Gov. George Pataki and state Republican
chairman William Powers have both endorsed Bush for the Republican
nomination, McCain said Bush could easily give the signal for them
to back off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know that the Berlin Wall is down,'' McCain said as he
rode a campaign bus between events here. ``People should be able to
get on the ballot in states. I'm sure that if Governor Bush told
them, don't do that, don't remove McCain's name, they would
respond. Everybody knows that I am a legitimate candidate. I should
be on the ballot.''
</P>
<P>
   At a campaign stop in Portsmouth, Bush said he would leave the
question of who appears on the ballot up to local party officials,
regardless of their connection to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important for all of us to play by the same
rules,'' Bush said. ``I'm confident that Chairman Powers will run
the party in a way that is fair for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's spokeswoman, Karen Hughes, said a decision on petition
challenges was up to New York party leaders. And a top lawyer for
the state's Republican hierarchy said the petition challenge was
going ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether McCain's name will appear on the ballot
for New York's primary on March 7 has been the subject of political
wrangling in the New York for months, but Thursday was the first
time that it attracted the attention of the candidates themselves
on the national campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   New York is infamous for having the most complicated system for
qualifying for the Republican primary ballot, requiring candidates
to collect a certain amount of signatures of registered voters from
each of the state's 31 congressional districts. In some other
states, candidates qualify simply by raising a certain amount of
money or being deemed by state officials as legitimate candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign submitted enough signatures to qualify for
the ballot in 25 congressional districts, and Bush supporters in
New York announced earlier this week that they were filing what are
known as general objections to the petitions, the precursor to a
challenge. Officials said they would be searching for signatures of
people who were not registered voters, not Republicans or not
residents of the specific Congressional district.
</P>
<P>
   It is a longstanding tradition in New York for front-runners to
bring such challenges against underdogs, but McCain Thursday
denounced New York state Republican officials as ``apparatchiks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not have the kind of Stalinist politics that the state
of New York, the Republican Party, has been practicing,'' he told
reporters after a speech to the New Hampshire state Legislature in
Concord
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never consider, ever consider,'' he said, ``allowing a
supporter of mine to challenge Governor Bush's right to be on the
ballot in all 50 states.''
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Bush's campaign, said, ``That's
the party's business.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One of the nation's largest pipeline operators quit
inspecting its lines for much of the 1990s and instead found flaws
by waiting for the pipes to break, the government said Thursday,
announcing that the company, Koch Industries, had agreed to pay a
fine of $30 million, the largest civil environmental penalty to
date.
</P>
<P>
   In fining the company, the Environmental Protection Agency said
Koch had failed to inspect its lines for cracks and corrosion,
resulting in leaks of three million gallons of crude oil, gasoline
and other oil products in 300 separate incidents in the last nine
years. It said the leaks, in six states from Texas to Missouri and
Alabama, had fouled lakes, rivers and Gulf Coast shorelines,
killing migratory birds and thousands of fish.
</P>
<P>
   The money will be shared by the federal government, which will
put it in a fund for oil-spill cleanups, and Texas, which did not
say what it would do with the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pollution that could have been and should have been
prevented by Koch Industries through the proper operation and
maintenance of their pipelines,'' Carol Browner, the agency's
administrator, said at a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Browner characterized the investigation and court case
against Koch as one of the most contentious ever carried out by the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokeswoman for Koch, Mary Beth Jarvis, said in a
telephone interview that the company always maintained its system
well, had spent $980 million on environmental improvements since
1990 and had reduced the number of spills by 96 percent. She said
she could not provide more details of its performance.
</P>
<P>
   At the environmental agency, Steven A. Herman, the assistant
administrator for enforcement, said that to save money, the company
did not inspect its pipelines for corrosion, or pressure-test them,
but simply found flaws by waiting for them to fail. ``It was
cheaper not to maintain them,'' Herman said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the spills was one on June 2, 1994, northeast of Wichita,
Kan., when a pipeline burst because of corrosion, releasing 79,000
gallons of unleaded gasoline. As a result, four houses were
evacuated and part of the local public water supply system was shut
down. In October of that year, a 47-year-old pipeline ruptured
because of operator error, dumping 90,000 gallons of crude oil into
a creek leading to Corpus Christi Bay in Texas. The incident
damaged wetlands in an area that is home to four varieties of
endangered sea turtles, the government said.
</P>
<P>
   Other spills were far smaller, in the tens of gallons each.
</P>
<P>
   Koch (pronounced COKE) is owned by one of the most powerful
families in the Midwest, the Koch family, who collectively are
worth about $6 billion. The conglomerate, with its headquarters in
Wichita, is one of the nation's largest privately held companies.
</P>
<P>
   Although it does not divulge financial details, Ms. Jarvis said
it employed more than 12,000 people in its pipeline, refining,
fertilizer, ranching and other operations. It operates about 10,000
miles of natural gas pipelines and 25,000 miles of other pipelines
around the South and Midwest. Government officials said its gross
annual revenues were about $33 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jarvis said that Koch had been praised by regulators for its
environmental work.
</P>
<P>
   The fine was part of a settlement between Koch Industries and
the government after charges were brought against the company in
federal district courts in Houston and Tulsa. Under the agreement,
which was filed Thursday morning in the court in Houston, the
company was not required to admit any wrongdoing. In addition to
the $30 million fine, it will pay $5 million for environmental
projects in the six states: Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Louisiana,
Missouri and Alabama. It will also improve its leak-detection
systems and hire an auditor who will report back to the government
on its progress.
</P>
<P>
   The spills occurred from 1990 to 1999, Ms. Jarvis said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said it had taken them months to put the case
together, partly because the company did business under many
different names, and when it reported spills, sometimes understated
their volume by 90 percent. But Ms. Jarvis said the company had
sometimes overreported the volumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the instantaneous action of reporting a pipeline accident,
you can be off in either direction, and we were off in either
direction,'' Ms. Jarvis said.
</P>
<P>
   Some spills contaminated land, but the settlement was reached
under the Clean Water Act, which sets damages for hazardous
materials, including oil and gasoline, that flow into navigable
waters. The largest civil environmental fine before this one also
came under that act, against Smithfield Farms, for $12.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon paid much more after the grounding of its tanker the Exxon
Valdez, but nearly all of that payment was to compensate for the
value of animals, birds and fish killed by the spill, rather than
as punishment, which was the case here.

SENATE RACE IS FORCING HILLARY CLINTON OUT OF COCOON  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As Hillary Rodham Clinton was leaving a news
conference in White Plains earlier this week, she noticed a small
group of reporters gathered on the street. Mrs. Clinton walked past
her Secret Service contingent and, with no aides in sight, struck
up a conversation about how, by her account, she had just
mishandled a question about gay marriage. Mrs. Clinton chatted for
nearly five minutes before retreating to her motorcade.
</P>
<P>
   It was a moment entirely out of character.
</P>
<P>
   In the seven months since Mrs. Clinton began traveling around
New York as a prospective candidate for the U.S. Senate, she has
constructed a largely controlled and often remote existence. As a
rule, she has participated in generally staged events, mostly
avoiding spontaneous contact with the public. She has held only a
few formal news conferences. She has declined interviews with
journalists and editorial boards. Her agreement to appear on ``The
Late Show With David Letterman'' on Wednesday night was a reminder
that she has yet to sit down for the television news shows that are
normally standard stops for anyone running for office.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Mrs. Clinton prepares to formally announce her
candidacy, there are signs of a thaw, evidenced both by her
relenting to Letterman and her presumably spontaneous stroll over
to the reporters in White Plains. She has held two news conferences
this week, and her aides say they are preparing to grant a series
of interviews, with reporters, editorial boards and television news
programs, coinciding with the formal declaration of her candidacy
in the first week of February.
</P>
<P>
   For any other candidate running for public office in New York,
this would be a relatively effortless, and unremarkable, turn of
events. But Mrs. Clinton's uneasy passage into being a candidate
reflects one of the central difficulties she faces in adjusting to
this new life: the struggle between her overriding caution and
distrust of the press on one side, and the pressure to burst
through the White House bubble of staff and security on the other.
</P>
<P>
   The push-and-pull of Mrs. Clinton's past and her future _ from
being the cocooned first lady in the White House to becoming a
buffeted candidate _ has until now remained in the background of
her campaign. But it looms larger now that her candidacy seems
inevitable, and as the pressure grows to act more like a
conventional candidate, be it from Letterman or from The Daily
News, which assailed her on its editorial page for declining an
interview with its editorial board.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's relative remoteness contrasts almost daily to the
actions of her expected Republican opponent, Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani. The mayor holds almost daily news conferences, and while
he certainly doesn't answer every question put to him _ he has made
a habit of refusing to answer questions if he senses that they are
driven by Mrs. Clinton or her campaign _ he is out there in a way
that Mrs. Clinton is not.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani also has a weekly radio call-in show, frequently
appears on the Sunday morning television interview shows, and holds
monthly town hall meetings. He has been known to call reporters and
even newspaper publishers to register a thought or a complaint.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, part of Mrs. Clinton's posture is beyond her
control. Unlike Giuliani, she travels with a troop of Secret
Service agents who can make it difficult for any member of the
public to come within 50 feet of her. In addition, there are
typically dozens of reporters following her wherever she goes;
spontaneous engagements are cumbersome when you are being tracked
by a bear of a press corps.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Mrs. Clinton intentionally created this life of
relative seclusion, after her disastrous effort to shepherd a
national health care program into law in 1994 and the backlash over
her role in the Whitewater real estate deal. Before then,
on-the-record interviews and off-the-record lunches with reporters
were a regular part of her schedule. Since then, for example, Mrs.
Clinton, has not brought reporters along on her plane when she
traveled, a way of discouraging coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Her friends describe her as intensely distrustful of the press,
and as she has turned to New York, she has been the subject of some
fairly critical coverage, particularly in The New York Post. All of
that has reinforced the first lady's reluctance to lower her guard.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that based on the evidence to date, Mrs. Clinton
would seem to be a skillful and even personable candidate. Although
she tends to be exceedingly cautious in discussing tough issues,
she has made only a few errors to date.
</P>
<P>
   Several of Mrs. Clinton's advisers, noting just how strongly she
is disliked by much of the public, have argued in recent weeks that
the best thing she could do to shed the baggage of her past is to
appear in unscripted public settings, so the public could get a
better sense of the woman who has for six years stood mostly in
Clinton's shadow. As the first lady was walking off Letterman's
stage, to a hug from the host and applause from the audience, it
seemed fair to say that this is one bit of advice the first lady is
likely to take.

EDWARD T. HANLEY SR., 67, FORMER LABOR LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wisconsin, Chicago)  (dal) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Edward T. Hanley Sr., who faced accusations of associating with
organized crime in his 25 years of leading the nation's largest
union of hotel and restaurant workers, died on Jan. 7. He was 67
and lived in Wadsworth, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a traffic accident near his country home in Land
O' Lakes, Wis., the Wisconsin authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Hanley was president of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant
Employees International Union from 1973 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   For decades he was a prominent, back-slapping fixture in
organized labor and was respected for turning his union into one of
the nation's most aggressive in organizing members _ hotel maids,
bellhops, barmaids, bartenders and waiters.
</P>
<P>
   But Hanley was frequently criticized for his lavish way of life;
he had the union buy a $2.5 million jet for his use and also had it
maintain an office near his vacation home in Palm Springs, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   In Congressional hearings and in prosecutors' papers, Hanley was
frequently accused of maintaining ties with organized crime
families, which he denied. In the 1980s the President's Commission
on Organized Crime found that the hotel workers' union was one of
the four most corrupt in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of those labor leaders with two sides,'' said
Richard Hurd, a professor in labor relations at Cornell University
``The most important thing he did for the union was to create an
organizing department that really meant something.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he had a very high salary, enjoyed all the privileges of
office and was aloof from the rank and file. And while he never was
convicted of any criminal ties to organized crime, he was always
suspected because he associated with criminal elements.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanley was pressured into retiring in July 1998 when a federal
monitor accused him of financial wrongdoing. The monitor, Kurt
Muellenberg, found that Hanley had bought a union-leased Cadillac
Allante sports coupe, worth at least $60,000, at an improperly low
price. The monitor also found that Hanley had received $31,000 from
the union's Chicago local even though he did no work for that
local, which was run by one of his sons.
</P>
<P>
   Muellenberg also found that Hanley had set up a fake union local
near his Wisconsin vacation home so that the local's president
could do favors for Hanley and his friends.
</P>
<P>
   Hanley consistently maintained that he had not engaged in
financial wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   John W. Wilhelm, who succeeded Hanley as president, praised him
for allowing the federal monitor to help clean up the union.
Wilhelm said the monitor's main purpose was to examine whether
Hanley and the union had been influenced by organized crime, and
Wilhem said the monitor's most important finding was that Hanley
and the union were free of organized crime influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He invited the federal government into our union,'' Wilhelm
said. ``He gave them unfettered authority to look everywhere, and
to take any action whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward T. Hanley was born in Chicago on Jan. 21, 1932, the son
of James and Doris Hanley. His father was a tavern owner, and he
grew up on Chicago's West Side, a working-class neighborhood. He
graduated from St. Phillip's High School in Chicago in 1949 and
served in the Air Force in the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1950s, he tended bar at his father's tavern, and in
1964, he was elected president of the Chicago Bartenders and
Beverage Dispensers Union.
</P>
<P>
   A likable man, he quickly climbed the union's ladder and became
president of the parent union in 1973, when he was 41. That year,
he married Kathryn Dekker.
</P>
<P>
   In his 25 years as its president, the union, like many other
unions, saw its membership plunge, falling to 230,000 from 400,000.
But it climbed again to more than 250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Hanley's supporters praised him for preventing membership from
dropping further, noting that he hired Wilhelm and other
organizers, who recruited thousands of casino and hotel workers
from Las Vegas and Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   Under Hanley, the union's organizing efforts slowly adapted to
the huge changes in the industry as it transformed from small,
independent operations to large, corporate-owned chains.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Hanley's critics say he focused on attracting members
largely to ensure that there was a steady supply of dues money to
support his comfortable way of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very generous to himself with our money,'' said
Jonathan Palewicz, a banquet waiter and union dissident in San
Francisco. ``He was a labor dictator, and he wasn't that successful
organizing when you consider how the industry expanded
exponentially.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanley is survived by his wife, Kathryn; two sons, Edward T.
Jr., of Chicago, and Thomas W., of Chicago; two sisters, June
Hansen of Sacramento and Dolores Calabrese of Chicago; and four
grandchildren.

EDITORIAL: REPUBLICANS AND THE CONFEDERATE FLAG 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Jan. 14:
</P>
<P>
   Both leading Republican candidates for president, Sen. John
McCain and Gov. George W. Bush, are being too clever by half in the
perennially inflammatory debate over a Confederate flag in South
Carolina. By declining to take a principled stand in this key
primary state, the candidates are pandering to bias and
perpetuating an outdated and ignoble practice from past Republican
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   For years, South Carolina has been the only state to fly the
Confederate flag over its Capitol. Black South Carolinians and many
whites rightly view the flag as a reactionary symbol of slavery and
segregation, but they have sought in vain to have it removed. The
NAACP has declared an economic boycott against the state for as
long as the flag flies, but Republicans in the state legislature
have blocked all attempts to lower it.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, for whom the state's primary Feb. 19 will be a crucial
test, has made conflicting statements on the flag. On Sunday,
facing a national television audience, he properly called it
``offensive'' and a ``symbol of racism and slavery.'' A day later,
addressing South Carolina reporters, he reversed himself and called
the flag ``a symbol of heritage.'' This was unmistakable code
language that conservative white Republicans _ McCain's base in the
state _ have long used to justify keeping the flag flying over the
Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been no more principled. While he has said he would not
fly the Confederate flag over the Texas Statehouse ``because of the
symbolism,'' he has also repeatedly said that the matter was for
South Carolinians to decide. This won't do. It fails to take into
account the concerns of a minority that lacks the political
strength to expunge this affront to its dignity as an equal.
</P>
<P>
   Other states across the South have long since moved beyond this
ugly debate. Alabama, the last to do so, removed its flag from the
Capitol dome in Montgomery in 1993 after black legislators won a
lawsuit. Business leaders throughout the region, eager to compete
in a cosmopolitan global market, have been at the forefront of
efforts to remove the alienating emblems of a bygone era.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign in South Carolina recalls earlier efforts by the
Republican Party to tap into residual segregationist impulses, from
Richard Nixon's Southern Strategy to Ronald Reagan's appeal for
``states' rights'' at a county fair in Philadelphia, Miss., in
1980. Today's Republicans are playing a cynical and, one might have
hoped, obsolete game.

LAVIN NEEDS WISE ASSISTANT ON BENCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Pete Dalis has done Steve Lavin a terrible
disservice. He calls himself an athletic director but he's really
just another indulgent parent, showering a stubborn, mollycoddled
Lavin with more freedom and responsibility than he was prepared to
handle.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the whole thing now is blowing up in everybody's face.
Isn't that so often the case when benevolence comes before common
sense in decision-making, same as in the dictionary?
</P>
<P>
   Dalis handed Lavin the keys to the Porsche of college basketball
programs in 1996 despite the fact Lavin never had been behind the
wheel of any program at any level.
</P>
<P>
   He hadn't steered a pre-owned Pinto, much less a late model
sedan. The sum total of his collegiate coaching experience had been
barking directions from the back seat.
</P>
<P>
   We're not here today to question Dalis' decision to wrench the
wheel from Jim Harrick, hand it to Lavin and then protect Lavin
with an obscene amount of insurance in the form of a rollover
contract that effectively allows the fourth-year coach to walk away
unscratched from any crash. That's well-trodden territory by now.
</P>
<P>
   If Dalis was inclined to let Lavin learn to steer a vehicle as
powerful as the UCLA basketball program in the fast lane that is
the Pacific-10 Conference, fine. But Dalis had a responsibility to
all the student-athletes going along for the ride and to all the
fans and boosters, too, to make sure Lavin had a veteran assistant
aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin's inexperience cried out for somebody riding shotgun who
had been down the trail before, and was familiar with the terrain
and maybe knew a few stretches to avoid, and wasn't at all shy
about speaking up if Lavin took his hands off the wheel, or failed
to see the potholes up ahead or wasn't sure which way to proceed
when confronted with a detour.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin looked instead to his best buddies from high school. He
promoted Jim Saia (whom he had lobbied Harrick to hire for the
third assistant's job). And he put Steve Spencer on the payroll in
Saia's old position when he might have had Spencer's mentor at Cal
Lutheran, Mike Dunlap. That made about as much sense as employing
Stephen King's typist to write the next top-selling thriller.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin didn't listen to the people who advised him to look for
someone with more depth to his resume. It was almost as if Lavin
didn't think his joyride at UCLA was going to last very long so he
decided, what the heck, he might as well let his friends share in a
few of the thrills.
</P>
<P>
   If Dalis had exercised more authority over Lavin then, there
wouldn't be all the skidding we're seeing now. For the same reason
kids have to drive in the company of an adult for a while before
they can set out by themselves, Dalis should have insisted Lavin
have a mature adult to ride out his first few seasons with him.
</P>
<P>
   Dalis should have made Lavin's sudden promotion _ or the
generous new contract Lavin wrung out of the Bruins after his
memorable first season, which ended two victories shy of the NCAA
title game (Thank you, Cameron Dollar and Charles O'Bannon) _
contingent on Lavin hiring someone with head-coaching experience to
balance his, ahem, youthful exuberance.
</P>
<P>
   The reason Dalis didn't, he said Thursday, was because ``When I
hire head coaches, I give them a certain latitude to hire their own
people. You hope they've made good decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to trust the instincts of a Bob Toledo, who paid
his dues for years in the high school and college ranks, and
another thing altogether to bestow autonomy on someone who hadn't
yet had a chance to earn it.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to bash all the criticism directed toward Lavin, Dalis
seemed to buttress our argument. ``No one's born a head coach,''
Dalis said. ``People go through a learning process. People grow
into the job.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there are those for whom the usual learning curve is
more like a race course straightaway. They can go quite far, quite
fast, with the proper mentoring. Pat Riley, when he started out
with the Lakers, had Bill Bertka. Phil Jackson has had Tex Winter.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin could have had someone like, say, Don Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson played for UCLA under John Wooden in 1951 and 1952 and
later developed big men Swen Nater and Mark Eaton while he was
coaching at Cypress College.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty more teachers where Johnson and Bertka and
Winter come from. They have much to offer, these men who have been
involved in basketball longer than Lavin has been breathing and,
yet, don't act like they know all there is to learn about the game.
</P>
<P>
   They have something half a million dollars can't buy: The wisdom
borne of experience.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine USC coach Henry Bibby throwing any kind of
defense at UCLA that former Cerritos College coaching great Jack
Bogdanovich hasn't seen and couldn't counter.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine Dan Gadzuric looking so lost in the post if
Johnson was around to teach him a move or two.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine UCLA players showing scant improvement from
one year to the next with Bertka in their midst.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, it's not hard to imagine UCLA boosters scurrying to
sign up for the game show, ``So You Want to be a Millionaire'' in
the hopes of winning enough to buy out Lavin's contract.
</P>
<P>
   Their lifeline?
</P>
<P>
   That's an easy one. It would have to be Dalis. He's the only one
can supply the answers to the questions that have every UCLA fan
stumped. &QL;

BRUNO ZEVI, ARCHITECTURE CRITIC WITH POPULIST FLAIR, DIES AT 81 
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bruno Zevi, editor of the Italian magazine L'Architettura and
one of Europe's most prominent architecture critics for five
decades, died on Sunday at his home in Rome. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   Trained as an architect, Zevi was strongly influenced by Frank
Lloyd Wright's concept of organic architecture. He designed a few
structures, like the Italian pavilion at the 1967 World's Fair in
Montreal, and championed the commission of others, including
Stazione Termini, Rome's railway terminal.
</P>
<P>
   But Zevi was best known as a writer. His most influential books
were ``Toward an Organic Architecture,'' published in 1945, and
``Architecture as Space: How to Look at Architecture,'' first
published in English in 1957. Building on Wright's belief that the
essence of architecture resides in voids rather than the solid
forms that enclose them, the book reinterprets great buildings of
the past in light of this modern idea.
</P>
<P>
   Zevi did not pretend to be a neutral observer. He dedicated
``Architecture as Space'' to ``all my friends in the organic
architecture movement.'' In a 1974 edition of the book, he took
critical aim at other architects and writers. With its acerbic and
sometimes appreciative comments on Zevi's contemporaries, the book
remains a valuable guide to architectural thought in the postwar
decades.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s and '70s Zevi found himself cast in a factional
split that still affects Italian architecture. A humanist in the
ancient tradition that dates from the Renaissance, he was rejected
by a new guard led by Manfredo Tafuri. Tafuri, who died in 1994,
was a Marxist historian and theorist who taught at the Istituto
Universitario di Architettura in Venice.
</P>
<P>
   His writings, particularly ``Theories and History of
Architecture,'' helped transform the Venetian school into one of
the world's leading architecture academies. They also provided the
intellectual inspiration for the theory and history programs that
have since proliferated in schools around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Zevi, meanwhile, took on a more populist role as a public
intellectual whose columns for the weekly news magazine L'Espresso
attracted a broad readership. His columns varied in length but were
invariably outspoken. He declined to subject buildings to rigorous
ideological scrutiny. Tafuri captured minds while Zevi won hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno Zevi was born in Rome in 1918 to an aristocratic Jewish
family. He left Italy in 1939 to escape persecution by the
Fascists. He briefly studied at the Architectural Association in
London and then transferred to the Graduate School of Design at
Harvard University. While at Harvard Zevi distinguished himself as
an iconoclast by writing a paper attacking the ideas of Walter
Gropius, the Bauhaus founder who was then directing the Graduate
School of Design.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Harvard in 1942 Zevi returned to London
and joined Justice and Liberty, an underground anti-Fascist group.
When the group's radio station was shut down, Zevi began work on
``Toward an Organic Architecture.'' He returned to Italy in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   Zevi believed that architecture had a role to play in
reconstructing postwar Europe along more democratic lines. He
regarded the organic approach, which began with the Arts and Crafts
movement and culminated with the work of Wright, as the best means
for achieving this goal. The Bauhaus-inspired International Style
left him cold. He thought that buildings should seek an integrated
relationship with nature instead of expressing the power of
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Zevi founded the monthly magazine L'Architettura in 1955. The
same year, he began a weekly column in L'Espresso. He closely
tracked developments in American as well as European architecture
and was an outspoken opponent of the postmodern movement that
flourished in the 1970s and '80s. In the late 1980s Zevi briefly
served in the Italian Chamber of Deputies as a member of the
Radical Party.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Tullia; a son, Luca; a daughter,
Ariadna; and a companion, whose name was given only as Ingne, all
of whom live in Rome.

WARNER-LAMBERT BEGINS MERGER TALKS WITH PFIZER

<TEXT>
<P>
   In an abrupt change of heart, executives at Warner-Lambert Co.
said Thursday they were negotiating a possible union with Pfizer
Inc., a suitor and rival they have battled for two months.
</P>
<P>
   That decision could leave Warner-Lambert's first choice as a
merger partner, American Home Products, alone at the altar for a
third time in two years. Either merger would create the world's
largest drug company.
</P>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert executives made their decision after the
company's shareholders increased their demands that the company
accept the far more lucrative offer from Pfizer. Pfizer's offer is
now worth about $75 billion, based on Thursday's closing stock
prices, while American Home's stands at about $50 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has always been the board's objective to secure the best
possible transaction for Warner-Lambert shareholders,'' Lodewijk
J.R. de Vink, chairman of Warner-Lambert, said in a statement,
``and we will now pursue discussions with Pfizer to determine if a
combination with them to achieve that goal is possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert shareholders had favored Pfizer's hostile bid
ever since it was made in early November, just hours after
Warner-Lambert and American Home said that they planned to merge.
But the shareholders have recently turned up the heat because of
worries about the thousands of lawsuits filed against American Home
by people who took the company's diet-pill combination called
fen-phen.
</P>
<P>
   American Home agreed in October to pay $3.75 billion to settle
claims from people who said their health suffered from the diet
treatment. But many people have refused to accept the settlement
and are instead continuing to pursue their claims separately.
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, a Mississippi jury awarded $150 million in
compensatory damages to five plaintiffs, four of whom said the
drugs had caused them to develop primary pulmonary hypertension, an
often fatal lung illness. The company then agreed to settle 1,400
cases brought in Mississippi for $350 million.
</P>
<P>
   The jury's decision caused American Home's stock price to slide
_ and the Pfizer bid to look even better to Warner-Lambert's
shareholders _ because it could mean that the cost of settling the
diet-drug lawsuits will be much greater than American Home
expected.
</P>
<P>
   American Home said Thursday it was not willing to simply go
away. ``We continue to support a strategic merger of equals of
Warner-Lambert and AHP under our existing merger agreement, the
terms of which remain under full force and effect,'' an American
Home spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Under that agreement, American Home stands to get as much as $2
billion in break-up fees if Warner-Lambert decides to merge with
Pfizer or another company. Some analysts said they were not sure
what the final outcome would be in what they called a bloody war
among the drug makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely not a certain deal because there is
significant animosity between Warner-Lambert and Pfizer,'' said
Neil Sweig, an analyst at Ryan, Beck &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Until Thursday, Warner-Lambert had bitterly fought Pfizer's bid,
filing several lawsuits and refusing even to talk to Pfizer
executives. For its part, Pfizer has tried in recent weeks to oust
members of the Warner-Lambert board and replace them with directors
supporting Pfizer's offer.
</P>
<P>
   If a merger takes place, Sweig and other analysts expect
significant layoffs at Warner-Lambert, which is based in Morris
Plains, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert has 43,000 employees, 3,000 of whom work in New
Jersey. Pfizer, based in New York, has 46,400 employees worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert is considered a prize in the pharmaceutical
industry because of Lipitor, its blockbuster cholesterol treatment,
and for other products it is developing. Warner-Lambert already has
a marketing agreement with Pfizer to sell Lipitor, a drug analysts
project could have worldwide sales of about $5 billion next year.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, both shareholders and analysts praised
Warner-Lambert's decision Thursday. Warner-Lambert rose $5.125 a
share, to $91.9375. Pfizer gained $1.9375, to $37. And American
Home rose 43.75 cents, to $42.625.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that the announcement was bound to accelerate the
merger frenzy in the drug industry.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts speculated that American Home, based in
Madison, N.J., would quickly seek another partner or become a
takeover target of other drug makers. Analysts suggested that
SmithKline Beecham PLC might move to merge with American Home or
that American Home would try to take over Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, a
move that could break up the plans of Pharmacia and the Monsanto
Co. to combine. Pharmacia is led by Fred Hassan, a former American
Home executive.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, American Home failed in attempts to merge with
SmithKline and later with Monsanto because of conflicts about which
corporate executive would have control.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell B. Weiner, a spokesman at American Home, said that the
company would not comment on any merger speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a pipeline of rich products,'' Weiner said. ``We're in
good shape.''

FUGITIVE HELD ON 1992 COUNT OF FIXING GOTTI JURY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Ga., N.C., Ill.)   (rk) 
 By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bosko Radonjich's life has been marked by
international intrigue, including, by his own account, days as a
Serbian freedom fighter, a CIA operative and a close adviser to
Radovan Karadzic, the former Bosnian Serb leader and fugitive war
criminal.
</P>
<P>
   But FBI officials said it was intrigue in Brooklyn, in the
service of another larger-than-life criminal figure, that landed
Radonjich, a Yugoslav emigre and former New York City parking lot
owner, in federal custody this month.
</P>
<P>
   Radonjich was arrested at the Miami airport on New Year's Day on
a 1992 indictment that charged him with tampering with a juror to
help fix the first federal racketeering trial of John J. Gotti, the
boss of the Gambino crime family. The case, in 1987, made Gotti's
reputation as a crime boss who could not be brought down.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the trial, the authorities said, Radonjich served
as an incongruous ethnic bridge: he headed the Irish gang known as
the Westies, a cadre of violent toughs who often did the bidding of
Gotti's Gambino crime family.
</P>
<P>
   Radonjich, who became an international fugitive after the
indictment, was arrested after U.S. Customs Service inspectors at
the Miami airport, alerted by an advisory about Radonjich's
traveling companion, discovered the 1992 warrant in the jury
tampering case. Radonjich and his companion, who was later
released, had arrived from Cancun, Mexico, and were bound for the
Bahamas, officials said. They did not identify the companion.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest was first reported Thursday by Ganglandnews.com, a
Web site that covers organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   While it was the Brooklyn charge that led to his arrest, law
enforcement officials said that based on notes and photographs
found in his possession, Radonjich's days of international intrigue
appeared far from over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The search revealed he had pictures of the Iraqi Embassy in
Havana,'' the official said, adding that Radonjich also had ``some
notes about U.S. military installations in Georgia and North
Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   The official had no explanation for the pictures or the notes,
but said that at least one of the two men had recently traveled to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The material was sobering for law enforcement officials, given
Radonjich's past. He pleaded guilty in 1978 to conspiracy charges
in the 1978 bombing of the home of the Yugoslav consul's home in
suburban Chicago and a plot to bomb a Yugoslav social club in that
city.
</P>
<P>
   Wiretaps in the case recorded him talking about the Chicago
bombing and making an admission that he took part in the June 23,
1975, bombing at the Yugoslav mission to the United Nations in New
York, officials said. No one was injured in that attack and no one
was ever charged in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Radonjich and his five co-defendants in the Chicago case were
identified as Serbian nationalists. Radonjich was released from
prison in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   The jury tampering indictment against Radonjich and George Pape,
a longtime friend, charged that the two men conspired with Gotti,
the crime boss' brother, Gene, and Salvatore Gravano, then the
Gambino family underboss, to fix the case.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1992 federal trial that resulted in Gotti's conviction on
murder and racketeering charges, Gravano testified that he gave
Radonjich $60,000 with which to bribe Pape, who was later convicted
and sentenced to three years in prison in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew J. Maloney, who was the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn
overseeing Gotti's case in 1987, praised Radonjich's recent arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important,'' he said. ``It's very frustrating to
know that people like Bosko are bold enough to tamper with the
system,'' he said, adding that the relatively light penalties for
jury tampering make it worth it for some criminals to try to fix
their cases. ``It pays to try to fix the jury because you get far
less time than for some substantive crimes,'' Maloney said. ``So if
you're facing life, why not?''
</P>
<P>
   Radonjich himself acknowledged some role in the jury tampering
in a 1997 interview in Yugoslavia with Esquire magazine. He also
said he was a close adviser to Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader
accused of genocide. But he said, he loved America and hoped to
return someday.

ALLEN BREED, 72, DEVELOPER OF AUTO AIR BAGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   (bl)

<P>
   Allen K. Breed, a pioneer in air bag technology for cars and
founder of one of the world's largest manufacturers of automobile
safety systems, Breed Technologies of Lakeland, Fla., died Dec. 13
at a hospital in Orlando, Fla. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   Breed died of a heart attack but had also been suffering from
lung cancer, said his wife, Johnnie Breed.
</P>
<P>
   Breed Technologies, which Breed started in 1961 as Breed Corp.,
makes air bags and the firing mechanisms and sensors for them. The
company also makes seat belts and steering wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Breed retired two years ago and became chairman emeritus.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Kent Breed was born on July 27, 1927, in Chicago. He
earned a bachelor's degree from Northwestern University and joined
RCA. In the 1950s, he worked for the Gruen Watch Co. and founded
Waltham Engineering.
</P>
<P>
   His work at Breed Corp. in the 1960s focused on military safety
devices. He later applied the technology to automotive air bag
systems and created his first air bag sensor design for cars in
1968.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Breed was the third-largest supplier of automotive
safety systems in the world, with sales of $1.4 billion, behind TRW
and Autoliv. Last month, however, the company sought Chapter 11
protection in U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
</P>
<P>
   Breed was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in Dearborn,
Mich., in 1999 in recognition of his invention of an air bag set
off by an electromechanical sensor, a forerunner of the electronic
sensors popular today.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, Breed is survived by two daughters, Leslie
Breed Bates, of Massachusetts, and Daryl Breed Hoitt, of New
Hampshire, and two sons, Douglas Allen and Jeffrey Allen, both of
Florida; two stepsons, James Michael Cordell, of Utah, and Terry
Daniel Cordell, of Florida, and eight grandchildren.  &QL;

JACK E. BROWN, A COMPUTER INDUSTRY LAWYER, DIES AT 72

<TEXT>
<P>
   Jack E. Brown, a lawyer prominent in several early cases
concerning the computer industry and intellectual property, died on
Jan. 6 at his home in Paradise Valley, Ariz. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, said Paul F. Eckstein, an attorney
at Brown &AMP; Bain, the Phoenix law firm that Brown founded 40 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's specialty was high-technology litigation, particularly
copyright violations. Most notably, he represented Apple Computer
in its unsuccessful ``look and feel'' case in 1989 against
Microsoft's Windows operating system. A U.S. District Court judge
ruled against Apple, holding that an element of an interface, like
the recycle bin on the Windows screen, infringed on a copyright
only if it looked exactly the same as another interface, in this
example, Apple's trash basket.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was more successful keeping the Franklin Computer Corp.
from cloning the Apple II personal computer in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   He also represented IBM, Intel, Unisys and United Technologies,
among other companies.
</P>
<P>
   He was listed recently in the National Law Journal as one of the
100 most influential lawyers in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Edward Brown was born on March 15, 1927, in Omaha. He
received a bachelor's degree from Northwestern University and a law
degree from Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   He ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. House of Representatives in
1972 as the Democratic Party candidate in the 4th Congressional
District of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is survived by his wife, Suzanne; two sons, Charles, of
Mesquite, Nev., and James, of Phoenix; two daughters, Abigail
Brown, of Phoenix, and Amanda Chang, of San Francisco; a brother,
Milton Brown, of Des Moines, and five grandchildren. &QL;

ISSUE ADS, HIS TARGET, ARE TURNED ON MCCAIN
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Though John McCain, like all the presidential
candidates, has been spared from television advertising attacks by
his rivals, he has not escaped negative advertising entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Recently two conservative groups have broadcast commercials that
attack McCain, in one case not only for his position on the issue
that matters most to the group but also for a campaign finance
proposal that would have limited the organization's influence.
</P>
<P>
   Before changing his campaign finance bill in the fall in an
unsuccessful effort to win passage, McCain's proposal would have
not only banned soft money but also regulated the very ``issue
ads'' that are being used against him.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, Americans for Tax Reform, an antitax group, has run
ads in New Hampshire maintaining that McCain's overhaul of the
campaign finance system would harm conservatives and help
Democrats, a stance that has also been taken by the front-runner
for the Republican nomination, Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The National Right to Life Committee has run an advertisement in
South Carolina saying McCain is not taking a strong enough stand
against abortion. And in New Hampshire, another advertisement from
the group chides him for making this joke about his memory: ``The
nice thing about Alzheimer's is you get to hide your own Easter
eggs.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Americans for Tax Reform, the Right to Life Committee
opposes McCain's campaign finance proposal as well.
</P>
<P>
   Grover G. Norquist, the executive director of the antitax group,
has worked closely with the Republican Party leadership in the
past. In October 1996, for instance, Norquist accepted millions of
dollars from the party to pay for an influential direct-mail
campaign to assure voters that Republicans would not cut Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   In a Republican presidential debate last week, McCain addressed
the advertisements of Norquist's group, telling Bush, ``You've got
a supporter right now that's running attack ads on me.'' He also
questioned who was paying for the advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Norquist said in an interview that the ads were financed by his
organization's members and that the purpose was not to sway voters
but to persuade McCain to abandon a ``stupid'' policy regarding
issue ads.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of issue ads say they purport to explain a policy issue
but are actually thinly disguised campaign spots that promote or
attack a candidate. One of those run by Americans for Tax Reform,
for example, urges voters to ``call John McCain and tell him to
leave the Republican Party alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Since late last month, the McCain campaign has issued several
blistering attacks on Norquist, saying his drive against the
senator is motivated by what they describe as his career as a
lobbyist for clients like Microsoft that depend heavily on
companies' being able to make soft-money contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans for Tax Reform is a wonderful-sounding name,'' said
former Sen. Warren Rudman of New Hampshire, national co-chairman of
McCain's campaign. ``As far as I'm concerned, it's a front
organization for Grover Norquist's lobbying activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Norquist, along with several other conservative groups,
including the National Rifle Association and the Christian
Coalition, began working against McCain's presidential campaign in
September, traveling to New Hampshire and South Carolina to
denounce the senator.
</P>
<P>
   Of the campaign's counterattack against him, he said, ``This is
a desperate attempt by the McCain people to attempt to persuade
people not to pay attention to the charges raised.''
</P>
<P>
   Dismissing any notion that the ads were intended to help Bush,
he said his group undertook a $200,000 radio advertising campaign
against the governor on a complicated state tax issue in Texas
during the Bush re-election drive in 1998.

<P>
   New York state correction officials have ended lockdowns at two
prisons where inmates were accused of plotting a statewide strike
that was to begin on New Year's Day, officials said Thursday .
</P>
<P>
   In the lockdowns, all 2,100 inmates at Sing Sing in Ossining,
Westchester County, and all 1,800 inmates at Green Haven prison in
Stormville, Dutchess County, had been confined to their cells 23
hours a day, except for visits, emergencies and some essential
jobs, since Christmas Eve. The department ended the lockdown at
Sing Sing late last week, and at Green Haven on Monday after no
major disruptions occurred at either prison, said James B. Flateau,
a spokesman for the department.
</P>
<P>
   But some prison guards, relatives of inmates and advocates of
inmates' rights said that many prisoners had refused to work.
</P>
<P>
   The state correction commissioner, Glenn S. Goord, ordered the
department to lock down both prisons on Dec. 24, after live
ammunition was discovered at Sing Sing, and inmates were accused of
plotting a prison strike. State prison officials and inmates'
advocates said that prisoners had been planning strikes at at least
eight state prisons largely to protest parole policies that some
regard as too strict.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a prison guard at Sing Sing was charged with planting
the ammunition, and he resigned after an investigation by the
Department of Correctional Services and the state police. But
Flateau said the loosening of restrictions had nothing to do with
the charge against the officer.
</P>
<P>
   He added that despite rumors of a strike, and fears of resulting
violence at several state prisons, there were no significant
instances of work being stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Guards and inmates' relatives and advocates, however, have
reported that a work stoppage did occur at Green Haven beginning
Jan. 3, the first day some inmates were required to return to their
jobs after the holidays, and that many prisoners refused to leave
their cells or eat meals.
</P>
<P>
   Denny Fitzpatrick, director of public relations for the New York
State Correctional Officers and Police Benevolent Association, a
union that represents state prison guards, said that about
three-quarters of the inmates at Green Haven are expected to work
or attend classes when there is not a lockdown, but that most of
those inmates had refused to leave their cells last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are not back to normal yet,'' he said. ``Inmates are
eating and coming out of their cells a little more, gradually,
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Alice Green, executive director of the Center for Law and
Justice in Albany, an inmate advocacy group, said she had received
about 20 letters from Green Haven inmates and about 15 calls from
their family members saying that many inmates had refused to go to
work, and that some had participated in a hunger strike.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the 72,000 inmates in state prisons work in jobs
from prison maintenance to furniture making and earn an average of
$1.05 a day.

AIRBUS ORDERS JET BY BOEING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ For the first time in its 30-year history, Airbus
Industrie significantly beat Boeing in winning orders for new
airplanes last year.
</P>
<P>
   The final numbers released Thursday by Airbus showed it bested
Boeing by nearly 20 percentage points _ 59 percent to 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, the Airbus backlog of planes on order is now
nearly equal to that of Boeing. Airbus has a backlog of 1,445
planes, against 1,512 for Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great year for Airbus. They beat Boeing fair and
square,'' said Joe Campbell, chief aerospace analyst for Leahman
Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we don't see Airbus being able to sustain this level of
difference between themselves and Boeing,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Boeing said the numbers show it is clearly time
for Airbus to end its use of government subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boeing congratulates Airbus on its successes, which underscore
the fact that Airbus should no longer need government subsidies to
compete in the market place,'' said Randy Harrison, spokesman for
Boeing Commercial Airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of subsidies has been a sore point with Boeing for a
long time.
</P>
<P>
   The gap in orders between Airbus and Boeing last year was even
wider than a first look at the numbers suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus said it had 476 firm orders in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, according to its web site, had 391 new orders in 1999.
But analysts said the Boeing figure is misleading because it
includes planes ordered in 1998 and in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In mid December, Alan Mulally, president of Boeing Commercial
Airplanes, announced that Boeing, to be consistent with the way
Airbus does things, would for the first time count orders from
customers who did not want to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   That meant Boeing was adding 163 such orders from unidentified
customers to its 1999 total, Mulally said.
</P>
<P>
   But some of those orders had been placed in 1998 and in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, the analyst, said 59 of the planes were actually
ordered the previous two years.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's Harrison said the figure was 58 planes. Using that
number, Boeing ended the year with only 333 new orders in 1999s. So
the 476 orders claimed by Airbus represents about 59 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has long argued that Airbus has on occasion counted
commitments in its order totals and not firm orders as Boeing does.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus said Thursday, in announcing its 1999 results at a news
conference in Paris, that it only counted orders for which a
contract was signed and a down payment was made.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison would not say if Boeing still suspects that Airbus has
fudged its numbers, but he did hint in a comment that Boeing is
suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1994, Airbus has claimed to have won about half the
orders,'' Harrison said. ``This year, six years after they first
claimed near equality in orders, we will deliver 480 planes and
they say they will deliver just over 300. So one has to wonder at
what point their orders take the form of aluminum rolling out the
door.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Boeing delivered a record 620 planes, while Airbus
delivered 294.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing Chairman Phil Condit likes to make the point that
deliveries are a much better way to judge Boeing's performance
against Airbus. That's because orders can change and also because
airlines pay the bulk of the purchase price of a new plane upon
delivery, not when the plane is ordered.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Beoing had 45 order cancelations and Airbus had 46,
according to calculations by Leahman Brothers' Campbell and other
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Taking that into account, Boeing had net 1999 orders of 288
planes and Airbus had net orders for 430 planes.
</P>
<P>
   Only once before, in 1994, has Airbus claimed to have beaten
Boeing in new orders. But that was at a time in the industry when
orders were so far down for both manufacturers that the Airbus
victory was considered insignificant. And considering the
cancellations that year, it was pretty close to a dead heat,
according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Airbus win is an important measure of how far
Airbus has come toward its goal of being Boeing's equal, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give Airbus a lot of credit,'' said Bill Fiala of
Edward Jones. ``They have done a great job of taking a company with
less than 20 percent market share and getting to 50 percent. But
that's only half the equation. They also need profitability.''
</P>
<P>
   Airbus is a consortium of four companies from France, Germany,
England and Spain. It does not make public its financial
performance and most analysts believe Airbus has sold planes at
huge discounts to gain market share against Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus said the 476 planes ordered in 1999 have a list price of
about $30.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing said its 391 orders would be valued at about $28.3
billion at list prices.
</P>
<P>
   But Campbell, the industry analysts, said the actual dollar
values of the 1999 orders by Boeing and Airbus are much less when
discounts are taken into account.
</P>
<P>
   He calculated that Boeing's 332 new orders are worth about $17.5
billion and the 476 Airbus planes are worth about $21.9 billion at
discounted prices.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing executives have said repeatedly over the last year the
company will walk away from a deal if it can't make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have welcomed such talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather Boeing have 30 percent market share and hefty
margins than 50 percent and struggling to show a profit,'' Fiala
said.
</P>
<P>
   David Venz, an Airbus spokesman, said the European plane maker
is winning the competitions against Boeing because its planes have
greater commonality, such as similar cockpits. And that means cost
savings to customers.
</P>
<P>
   He also dismissed reports that Boeing has been losing market
share because of pricing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boeing has been saying that for 10 years,'' he said in a
recent interview. ``Whenever they lose it always comes to pricing.
If Airbus is such a notorious under pricer, why would we ever
lose?''
</P>
<P>
   But Paul Nisbet, an analyst with JSA Research, discounted
commonality as the reason for the Airbus gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``How does Airbus explain the former success of Boeing,'' he
asked. ``I don't see that Airbus planes have any more commonality
now than they used to have.''
</P>
<P>
   He said pricing, not commonality, best explains the Airbus wins.
Boeing can't compete as it once did because of its own undoing, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's cost skyrocketed two years ago when its assembly lines
faltered as the company ramped up production to record levels.
Boeing took about $3 billion in unanticipated charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``They screwed up royally,'' Nisbet said of Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing must continue to get its production costs down so it can
offer airlines more attractive prices for its planes if it wants to
be competitive with Airbus, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company's new executive team is making great progress in
cutting costs, Nisbet said. He expects Boeing to narrow the order
gap this year, and possibly overtake Airbus again by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long slow process,'' Nisbet said. ``What Boeing did was
like throwing sand in a smoothly running engine. You can't wash it
out. You have to rebuild it.''

PUFF DADDY INDICTED OVER GUNS IN NIGHTCLUB SHOOTINGS CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Fixes spelling of Wardel in 2nd graph, fixes name of club
where shootings occurred, other changes throughout, including
additions at end on his lawyers and his businesses.)

 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Manhattan grand jury Thursday charged Sean Combs,
the rap performer better known as Puff Daddy, with possession of
two illegal handguns as part of its investigation into shootings
that wounded three people on Dec. 27 at a Times Square nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   Combs took the unusual step of testifying in his own defense,
but the indictment appears to rely on the account of the man who
was his part-time driver that night. While the testimony of the
driver, Wardel Fenderson, 42, is sealed, evidence presented by
prosecutors indicated that he saw Combs throw a gun out the window
of the car as they fled police.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment presents another daunting challenge for Combs, a
30-year-old multimillionaire, Grammy-winning artist and producer
who socializes with the city's elite and has a knack for surviving
seemingly disastrous blows to his career. Even as he faces poor
sales of his latest record, other performers leaving his recording
label and rumblings of discontent from his corporate backer, Combs
must now resolve criminal charges that carry a penalty of up to 15
years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The rapper, whose business empire includes the Bad Boy
Entertainment music label, a restaurant chain, a clothing line and
a television production company, issued a statement vehemently
denying the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision to indict me is wrong,'' Combs said. ``I'm
innocent, and we will prove it. I am putting my faith in God, and I
know my name will be cleared.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Lopez, the singer and actress who was in the car with
Combs, stood by him Thursday. She issued a statement saying she had
``cooperated fully'' with the district attorney's office and was
``surprised and saddened'' by the indictment. ``I was with him that
evening,'' she said. ``At no time did I see him with a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   The indictment charged Combs with possession of a 9 mm handgun
found in the car, and with possession of the 9 mm gun that was
thrown from the car as it sped away from the crowded Club New York
on West 43rd Street.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Combs' associates were also named in the indictment: a
rap protege, Jamal Barrow, who has been charged with three counts
of attempted murder stemming for the accusation that he pulled his
own gun and fired it three times in the club, and a bodyguard,
Anthony Jones, who faces a weapons charge.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Thursday, the Manhattan district attorney,
Robert M. Morgenthau, said that the 1999 Lincoln Navigator in which
Combs was riding had secret compartments. He said nothing had been
found in the compartments.
</P>
<P>
   But law enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of
anonymity said there was evidence that Combs and his bodyguard
tried to stash the guns in them during the police chase, but were
unable to open them. Combs threw his gun out the window, they said,
and Jones placed his on the car floor.
</P>
<P>
   Someone walking on Eighth Avenue saw the gun thrown from the
vehicle, picked it up and later turned it over to police, the
officials said. And at least one other witness had seen Combs
brandish a gun inside the club after an altercation with a group of
men, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials also said Thursday that they were
investigating accounts that while Combs was being held for
questioning overnight after the chase, he was heard in jail
offering Fenderson, the driver, a $300,000 ring and $50,000 in cash
if he would back up Combs' version of events.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Brounstein, the lawyer representing Fenderson, declined
to comment Thursday on whether the driver testified before the
grand jury. But he thanked the panel for not indicting his client
and praised prosecutors for a ``fair'' investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Fenderson is not a member of the tightly knit group of employees
and friends who work for Combs, according to people familiar with
the case. He had worked for Combs only on weekends since October.
</P>
<P>
   Combs has hired two new high-profile lawyers, Benjamin Brafman
and Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., and they spoke for him at a news
conference. Cochran urged ``the public, Sean's millions of fans and
those with whom he is involved'' in various business ventures to
withhold judgment.
</P>
<P>
   The reference to Combs' business partners appeared to reflect
his shifting financial fortunes. Along with slow sales of his
latest album and the departure of the popular group the LOX from
his label, the shooting also derailed the career of Barrow, also
known as Shyne, whose new album was expected to revive the label's
fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Bertelsmann A.G., the vast German corporation that
underwrites Combs' label, declined to comment on his indictment
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Jeannine Amber, features editor at Vibe magazine, said it was
far too early to count out Combs, who has pushed beyond the
traditional boundaries of rap stardom to achieve unusually high
status among both blacks and whites. While the charges may hurt his
standing among wealthy socialites who attend his lavish parties,
she said, many of the disenfranchised may decide he is being
demonized. She added, ``I'm sure there are fans out there for whom
this looks like a witch hunt.''

CLINTON CALLS FOR INVESTMENT IN POOR AREAS
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ President Clinton Thursday proposed giving more tax
credits to businesses that invest in the country's poorest areas,
telling audiences in New York City that such spending is both a
moral obligation during these flush times and squarely in the
economic self-interest of those who have thrived the most.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we keep this going?'' Clinton asked, referring to the
nation's remarkable prosperity in a speech at the Sheraton New York
in Midtown Manhattan. The president suggested that the answer lies,
almost paradoxically, in those parts of the country that have
largely been left behind by the information age _ places like the
inner city of East St. Louis, or the remote towns of Appalachia, or
the immigrant neighborhoods of Brooklyn, a borough whose poverty
rate is more than double the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike those booming regions where the job market is tight and
new growth raises the specter of wage-driven inflation, depressed
areas offer the possibility of growth without inflation, Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the unemployment rate in Brooklyn drops from 9.4 percent to
4.1 percent, where it is nationwide, you can get a whole lot of new
jobs there,'' Clinton said at a conference sponsored by the Wall
Street Project, the Rev. Jesse Jackson's initiative to get
corporations to open their boardrooms and capital to minority
groups. ``And then,'' Clinton continued, ``those people that have
the jobs spend their money there, and that won't contribute to
inflation. It will keep the economy growing, and the same thing is
true all across the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The president took several specific steps Thursday to flesh out
what aides are calling his ``new opportunity agenda.'' After a
lengthy telephone conversation in the morning with President Hafez
Assad of Syria about peace negotiations with Israel, Clinton
proceeded by motorcade from his new home in Chappaqua to Brooklyn,
where he opened a small-business development center at Boricau
College in Williamsburg. The center, largely financed by the Small
Business Administration and a $100,000 grant from Citigroup, will
offer $13 million in new loans and management training to
Brooklyn's 93,000 small businesses, a third of which have minority
owners.
</P>
<P>
   At the center, Clinton announced a plan to increase to $5
billion from $2 billion the amount of money available during the
next 10 years for his ``New Markets'' tax credits, a program that
gives companies a 25 percent tax credit for each dollar invested in
community development projects in poor areas.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he would push to expand the federal government's
empowerment zones, depressed areas where some employers are
eligible for 20 percent tax credits on up to $15,000 in wages per
employee. Clinton said he would ask Congress to approve an
additional $4 billion over 10 years to, among other things,
increase the number of zones to 41 from 31. He said the Treasury
Department would spend $30 million on pilot programs to encourage
11 million low-income families with no bank accounts to open
low-cost ``First Accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stressed the notion that the nation, weeks away from
setting a record for the longest economic expansion, was uniquely
positioned to make these investments. ``If we can't do this now, we
will never do this,'' he said in Manhattan. ``This is the only time
in the lifetimes of most of us here that we've ever had a chance to
give everyone a shot at the American dream.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a theme shared by House Speaker Dennis Hastert of
Illinois, the Republican leader, who issued a statement this week
saying he was ``very excited to see the president unveil his ideas
for community renewal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our nation,'' Hastert said, ``is enjoying an unprecedented
period of economic growth, and it is important that no community be
left behind.'' Hastert promised to work with the Clinton
administration to come up with a package of tax and regulatory
relief to stimulate investment in poor areas.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Clinton shared a podium with Jackson at a
Rainbow Coalition gala at the New York Stock Exchange. He then
headed to a fund-raising dinner at the Fifth Avenue home of John
and Margo Catsimatidis. The dinner with 60 couples raised $250,000
for the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   On the political front, the president also got in several plugs
Thursday for Hillary Clinton's performance Wednesday on the ``Late
Show With David Letterman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' he said in Brooklyn, ``I thought I was supposed to
be the funny one in this family.''

GATES STEPS DOWN AS MICROSOFT CEO; BALLMER GETS THE JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RICHMAN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ After 25 years of building the company he co-founded
into one of the most powerful, influential and profitable engines
of the modern era, Bill Gates on Thursday stepped down as chief
executive officer of Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Gates, 44, relinquished that title to Steve Ballmer, 43, his
friend and colleague of more than 20 years. The raucous, ebullient
Ballmer, who joined the company in the summer of 1980 and became
president in July 1998, will retain that title and also take a
board seat.
</P>
<P>
   Gates will remain chairman and take on a new role: chief
software architect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a nice milestone to look back and say, `Hey, over the
last 25 years we really got something done,' and I'm proud of
that,'' Gates said at a hastily convened press conference Thursday.
``But it's also a milestone to look forward and say, `What can
software _ and in particular, Microsoft software _ do to make
things a lot better in the 10 years to come?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gates led the company's spectacular rise to a business behemoth
worth more than $500 billion and steered it through its turbulent
recent history, including a federal judge's ruling in November that
Microsoft used monopoly powers to harm consumers and competitors.
</P>
<P>
   As Microsoft's new chief, Ballmer declared, ``I'm certainly
honored and very, very excited about the opportunity. I'm
enthusiastic about working with Bill in this new way over the
coming years.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer called Gates ``one of the best idea machines in the
world, someone who can see things in a unique way.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how the two men will share their management
responsibilities wasn't immediately clear.
</P>
<P>
   But Paul Allen, who co-founded Microsoft with Gates, worked with
both men at the company and now sits on the company's board, said
he believes their changes in responsibility _ especially Ballmer's
_ will be major.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve has stepped up and taken the additional responsibility,
which is no small thing,'' said Allen, the world's third wealthiest
man, in a rare interview. ``As the CEO, the buck stops with you,
and you have to make real decisions. He'll make a lot of decisions
that formerly were Bill's to make. And he'll do it with his own
style.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer, who used to report to Gates, will now answer to the
board, just as Gates does.
</P>
<P>
   Each man now appears to be doing what he likes best. As
Microsoft's long-time vice president of sales, Ballmer helped make
Windows a household name in the 1990s. The new role, observers
said, is nothing more than an extension of his role as president.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people miss is that despite everything, Ballmer gets the
job done,'' said Michael Gartenberg, vice president of the
technology consulting firm, the Gartner Group.
</P>
<P>
   William Epifanio, an analyst with J.P. Morgan, said, ``This is a
good change. Microsoft faces a lot of challenges going forward, and
Ballmer is a terrific manager, really, with a personality more
suited to the chief executive's job than Bill Gates.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Gates, he said he has wanted for at least two years to
get back to a more strategic position. As chief software architect,
he will spend most of his time strategizing with the company's four
product groups, ``talking about feedback we get from developers and
making sure the pieces add up.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates said he won't actually be writing code, as he did in the
company's formative years when he wrote operating systems for some
of the earliest personal computers. ``But I may be
(ital)threatening(end ital) to write code,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   The succession comes at what Gates called an inflection point in
the company's evolution. An intense, multi-year effort to create
Windows 2000, the business-oriented operating system that succeeds
Windows NT, came to a climax last month with the product's release
to manufacturing. Gates has described Windows 2000, which is set to
ship Feb. 17, as the most important product Microsoft has ever
produced.
</P>
<P>
   Now the company will turn its attention to an initiative it
calls Next Generation Windows Services, emphasizing the Internet as
a development and application platform at least as heavily as it
does the traditional focus of Microsoft's efforts: the personal
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Products will roll out over the next three years, with early
details to be revealed this spring at Forum 2000, a day for
discussing strategy with press and analysts. Additional details
will be released this summer at the annual developers' conference.
As part of the plan, updates to SQL Server, Exchange, and
development tools will be released over the next year, Gates said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an evolutionary change in how the company is run, but the
company is at a revolutionary point'' in its development, said Jeff
Raikes, group vice president for worldwide sales and support.
</P>
<P>
   One skeptic suggested Thursday's announcements, which surely
have been pending for months, had nothing to do with the company's
product flow.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, suggested Giga Group analyst Rob Enderle, they may have
been timed to let Microsoft evade an agreement not to discuss
settlement negotiations in the Department of Justice's antitrust
suit.
</P>
<P>
   A government proposal, leaked Wednesday, suggested the
plaintiffs favor a harsh penalty: breaking up the company into
three pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Enderle suggested that Microsoft's responding to a press
question about that proposal would offer the company a chance to
comment without formally making a statement. And sure enough, in
answer to the first question asked at the press conference, Ballmer
blasted the government's idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be absolutely reckless and irresponsible for
anyone to try to break up this company,'' Ballmer said. ``I think
it would be unprecedented, and I think it would be the single
greatest disservice that anybody could do to consumers in this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer said in a teleconference call he believed the
government's leaks were deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   But Paul Allen rejected Enderle's theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who thinks this is a reaction to the lawsuit ... is
getting it completely wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On CNBC, President Clinton described Ballmer as ``a very able
man, and Gates is a genius with technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer is the son of Swiss immigrants. He grew up in Detroit,
where his father worked for Ford Motor Co. A graduate of Harvard
University, Ballmer earned a degree in applied math and economics
and later worked at Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. as an assistant product
manager, according to his official Microsoft biography. He then
attended the Stanford Graduate School of Business.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer's bulldog attitude is what attracted Gates when he first
met Ballmer at Harvard, where they were both students. The two have
worked closely together ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve is a great manager and a great motivator,'' Raikes said.
``I've worked for Steve for 18 years, and I can say that the
company's in good hands.''

LITTLE PROGRESS IS REPORTED IN ANTITRUST TALKS

<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Microsoft's top executives said Thursday that
they were still hopeful of settling the government antitrust case
against the company before a federal judge issues his final ruling.
And they said company officials had had far-reaching internal
discussions about their options.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had some amazing discussions and wild ideas about what
we would do,'' Steven A. Ballmer, the company's president, said in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
   But he and Bill Gates, the chairman, repeatedly ruled out any
breakup of Microsoft, emphasizing that its software strategy could
succeed only with a unified company.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the settlement talks said Thursday that there
had been little progress toward a negotiated settlement, and the
two sides had rarely even met face to face in the course of
mediation by Richard A. Posner, a federal appellate judge in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   They said the Justice Department and the 19 states suing
Microsoft were increasingly leaning toward a severe ``structural''
remedy _ breaking up the company or forcing it to license its
software to rivals. Still, such remedies could take many forms,
they said, and the plaintiffs have not settled firmly on a single,
preferred remedy.
</P>
<P>
   If the mediation talks collapse, the two sides will go back to
federal court in Washington before Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
for final arguments scheduled for Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about press reports that the government would seek to
break Microsoft into two or three separate companies, Ballmer said
such a move would be ``reckless beyond belief'' and would harm
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer said he would be ``the point man'' in the company's
decision-making in the settlement talks but that Gates would
continue to be involved.

TEACHER PAY LAGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - The salary gap between teachers and other
professionals with similar educations is growing, a new report
says.
</P>
<P>
   Educators' annual salaries are an average $8,000 less at the
start of their careers and lag $24,000 by age 50, reports Education
Week's annual survey.
</P>
<P>
   The decades-old disparity heads toward crisis levels as states
hold teachers more accountable and schools struggle to fill
teaching posts, experts say. Two million teachers will be needed in
the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Salaries for professionals with bachelor's degrees jumped 17
percent from 1994 to 1998, said the report, based on U.S. Census
data. Teacher salaries inched up 1 percent over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to recruit the excellence you want without
making the salary package attractive,'' said Tim Rockey, a
government teacher at Sunnyslope High School in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Rockey has taught and participated in salary negotiations for a
quarter-century. With a master's degree and 24 additional higher
education hours, he makes $50,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona pays its teachers an average of $35,025, the 34th lowest
salary in the nation, according to a report released by the
National Education Association, the largest teachers union.
</P>
<P>
   To combat the grim numbers, Arizona school districts dangle
incentives, including signing bonuses. But the short-term fixes
won't solve the problem, many teachers say.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching ranks used to be plump with ``missionaries,'' folks
willing to live the lower-middle-class lifestyle for the chance to
mold young minds. But today, Jan. 14, there's just not enough money
to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   After several years, some leave what they consider a ``Peace
Corps'' job to make enough money elsewhere to start or support a
family.
</P>
<P>
   Those who stay often take on second jobs. Dianne Erbe teaches
seventh grade at Sun Valley Elementary School in Peoria during the
day and rings up groceries at Safeway at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going back to get my master's,'' said the 41-year-old, who
is in her fourth year of teaching and who makes about $28,500 a
year. ``I'm trying to pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers get larger raises if they further their education.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Kotterman, president of the Arizona Education Association,
says to hire and retain good teachers, ``money really is the
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't apologize for trying to find more money for
teachers,'' Kotterman said. ``They deserve it.''
</P>
<P>
   She says that responsibility rests with lawmakers, who fund
schools each year.
</P>
<P>
   However, state Rep. Steve May countered, the Legislature has
funneled more money to education. The problem is that school
districts aren't pumping it into teacher salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to bite the bullet and give more money to teachers
than administrators,'' the east Phoenix Republican said.
</P>
<P>
   May said there are other things the Legislature might do to help
teacher salaries, such as adding more school days or offer them
special tax credits.
</P>
<P>
   Another legislator, Sen. Scott Bundgaard, R-Phoenix, plans to
introduce a bill next week that would bump up teachers' base salary
$5,000.
</P>
<P>
   But with state attention on reducing class size and buildings, the money may not be there.
</P>
<P>
   If teacher pay isn't bulked up, Joni Burd is fearful.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't make a living,'' said the special-education reading
teacher at Underdown Junior High in Cashion, a ranching community
in the Phoenix's West Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Starting pay in her district: $23,500. After 18 years as a
teacher, the 43-year-old mother of two makes $30,500.
</P>
<P>
   She gets tired of hearing outsiders say that teachers have it
easy because they get summers off and merely baby-sit during the
school year. Not a week goes by that Burd isn't working 40-plus
hours in her classroom and taking papers home to grade.
</P>
<P>
   However, this teacher doesn't let the negative comments, hard
work or low pay get her down.
</P>
<P>
   Why does she stay? ``It's the kids,'' Burd said. &QL;

BUSH TO RUN ADS IN SPANISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - Choosing Arizona as his experimental canvas, Texas Gov.
George W. Bush plans to air the first ever Spanish-language
television ads in a Republican primary, campaign aides said.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain, trying to hold his own against Bush, also likely
will put up ads, though not in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   The television ads could be particularly influential in Arizona
because the candidates are spending most of their time campaigning
elsewhere and plan no campaign visits here until February.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the air war will be Steve Forbes, who also will launch
new TV ads in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, who has blanketed the state with ads for a month, the
Spanish-language spots will only intensify a surprisingly ardent
effort to win Arizona. For McCain, advertising, once unimaginable
because of its cost, could help him beat back the front-runner in
his home state.
</P>
<P>
   In confirming a possible ad buy, McCain aides were quick to add
that if they are victorious in New Hampshire and South Carolina,
they won't have to run ads back home.
</P>
<P>
   Bush advisers said they plan to run television ads targeting
Hispanic voters in both English and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish-language ads are intended to draw in Hispanic voters
not only for the primary but also for a general-election battle,
advisers said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Merrill, a pollster at Arizona State University, noted the
Spanish-language ads are aimed a population that rarely votes
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he is saying is, `I've got resources beyond what I need
for the primary process, and I can already start my
general-election campaign,' '' Merrill said. &QL;

ASU SATELLITE SET FOR LIFTOFF TODAY

(TEMPE, Ariz.) - A tiny satellite built by 400 Arizona State
University students will be the first launched worldwide in the new
millennium, if all goes as planned tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base in central California
is scheduled for 8 Arizona time. The light from the launch should
be visible on the western horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you a sense of pride to make history,'' said ASU
Professor Helen Reed, faculty adviser on the project.
</P>
<P>
   ASUSat1 will be the first of four payloads launched into orbit.
The others belong to the Air Force Academy, Stanford University and
the Air Force Research Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   ASU's satellite weighs 12 pounds. It will make maps focusing on
Earth vegetation and weather, as well as help ham radio operators
communicate with one another.
</P>
<P>
   Reed and key student participants will be in the control room at
Vandenberg during liftoff.
</P>
<P>
   Other students will staff a ground station at ASU to listen for
the satellite's beacon as it passes 500 miles above the campus
early Saturday, Jan. 15, traveling 5 miles a second.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a six-year countdown.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Reed and the students approached Orbital Sciences Corp.
in Chandler with the idea of a student-built satellite.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had mechanical people build the structure, software people
write the code that controls the satellite and electrical people
build our own boards,'' said Sarah Stanford, 21, an electrical
engineering senior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be neat to see our work become successful.'' &QL;

AIRBUS ORDERS JET BY BOEING 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SEATTLE _ For the first time in its 30-year history, Airbus
Industrie significantly beat Boeing in winning orders for new
airplanes last year.
</P>
<P>
   The final numbers released Thursday by Airbus showed it bested
Boeing by nearly 20 percentage points _ 59 percent to 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, the Airbus backlog of planes on order is now
nearly equal to that of Boeing. Airbus has a backlog of 1,445
planes, against 1,512 for Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great year for Airbus. They beat Boeing fair and
square,'' said Joe Campbell, chief aerospace analyst for Leahman
Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we don't see Airbus being able to sustain this level of
difference between themselves and Boeing,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Boeing said the numbers show it is clearly time
for Airbus to end its use of government subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boeing congratulates Airbus on its successes, which underscore
the fact that Airbus should no longer need government subsidies to
compete in the market place,'' said Randy Harrison, spokesman for
Boeing Commercial Airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of subsidies has been a sore point with Boeing for a
long time.
</P>
<P>
   The gap in orders between Airbus and Boeing last year was even
wider than a first look at the numbers suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus said it had 476 firm orders in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, according to its web site, had 391 new orders in 1999.
But analysts said the Boeing figure is misleading because it
includes planes ordered in 1998 and in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In mid December, Alan Mulally, president of Boeing Commercial
Airplanes, announced that Boeing, to be consistent with the way
Airbus does things, would for the first time count orders from
customers who did not want to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   That meant Boeing was adding 163 such orders from unidentified
customers to its 1999 total, Mulally said.
</P>
<P>
   But some of those orders had been placed in 1998 and in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, the analyst, said 59 of the planes were actually
ordered the previous two years.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's Harrison said the figure was 58 planes. Using that
number, Boeing ended the year with only 333 new orders in 1999s. So
the 476 orders claimed by Airbus represents about 59 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has long argued that Airbus has on occasion counted
commitments in its order totals and not firm orders as Boeing does.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus said Thursday, in announcing its 1999 results at a news
conference in Paris, that it only counted orders for which a
contract was signed and a down payment was made.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison would not say if Boeing still suspects that Airbus has
fudged its numbers, but he did hint in a comment that Boeing is
suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1994, Airbus has claimed to have won about half the
orders,'' Harrison said. ``This year, six years after they first
claimed near equality in orders, we will deliver 480 planes and
they say they will deliver just over 300. So one has to wonder at
what point their orders take the form of aluminum rolling out the
door.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Boeing delivered a record 620 planes, while Airbus
delivered 294.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing Chairman Phil Condit likes to make the point that
deliveries are a much better way to judge Boeing's performance
against Airbus. That's because orders can change and also because
airlines pay the bulk of the purchase price of a new plane upon
delivery, not when the plane is ordered.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Beoing had 45 order cancelations and Airbus had 46,
according to calculations by Leahman Brothers' Campbell and other
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Taking that into account, Boeing had net 1999 orders of 288
planes and Airbus had net orders for 430 planes.
</P>
<P>
   Only once before, in 1994, has Airbus claimed to have beaten
Boeing in new orders. But that was at a time in the industry when
orders were so far down for both manufacturers that the Airbus
victory was considered insignificant. And considering the
cancellations that year, it was pretty close to a dead heat,
according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Airbus win is an important measure of how far
Airbus has come toward its goal of being Boeing's equal, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give Airbus a lot of credit,'' said Bill Fiala of
Edward Jones. ``They have done a great job of taking a company with
less than 20 percent market share and getting to 50 percent. But
that's only half the equation. They also need profitability.''
</P>
<P>
   Airbus is a consortium of four companies from France, Germany,
England and Spain. It does not make public its financial
performance and most analysts believe Airbus has sold planes at
huge discounts to gain market share against Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus said the 476 planes ordered in 1999 have a list price of
about $30.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing said its 391 orders would be valued at about $28.3
billion at list prices.
</P>
<P>
   But Campbell, the industry analysts, said the actual dollar
values of the 1999 orders by Boeing and Airbus are much less when
discounts are taken into account.
</P>
<P>
   He calculated that Boeing's 332 new orders are worth about $17.5
billion and the 476 Airbus planes are worth about $21.9 billion at
discounted prices.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing executives have said repeatedly over the last year the
company will walk away from a deal if it can't make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have welcomed such talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather Boeing have 30 percent market share and hefty
margins than 50 percent and struggling to show a profit,'' Fiala
said.
</P>
<P>
   David Venz, an Airbus spokesman, said the European plane maker
is winning the competitions against Boeing because its planes have
greater commonality, such as similar cockpits. And that means cost
savings to customers.
</P>
<P>
   He also dismissed reports that Boeing has been losing market
share because of pricing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boeing has been saying that for 10 years,'' he said in a
recent interview. ``Whenever they lose it always comes to pricing.
If Airbus is such a notorious under pricer, why would we ever
lose?''
</P>
<P>
   But Paul Nisbet, an analyst with JSA Research, discounted
commonality as the reason for the Airbus gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``How does Airbus explain the former success of Boeing,'' he
asked. ``I don't see that Airbus planes have any more commonality
now than they used to have.''
</P>
<P>
   He said pricing, not commonality, best explains the Airbus wins.
Boeing can't compete as it once did because of its own undoing, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's cost skyrocketed two years ago when its assembly lines
faltered as the company ramped up production to record levels.
Boeing took about $3 billion in unanticipated charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``They screwed up royally,'' Nisbet said of Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing must continue to get its production costs down so it can
offer airlines more attractive prices for its planes if it wants to
be competitive with Airbus, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company's new executive team is making great progress in
cutting costs, Nisbet said. He expects Boeing to narrow the order
gap this year, and possibly overtake Airbus again by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long slow process,'' Nisbet said. ``What Boeing did was
like throwing sand in a smoothly running engine. You can't wash it
out. You have to rebuild it.''

BOEING BUYS HUGHES' SATELLITE ARM FOR $3.75 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Boeing, the world's largest aerospace company, added
what analysts describe as another jewel to its crown Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The company announced, as expected, that it has agreed to buy
Hughes Space and Communications Co., the world's largest maker of
communication satellites, for $3.75 billion in cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boeing intends to be No. 1 in space,'' said Boeing Chairman
Phil Condit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This acquisition is a significant step forward in executing
our goal of becoming the industry leader in integrated space-based
information and communications.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes pioneered the development of communication satellites and
has built nearly 40 percent of all communication satellites now in
operation. It has a backlog of about 36 satellites worth some $4.1
billion, said Jim Albaugh, president of Boeing Space and
Communications division.
</P>
<P>
   The division, which Boeing has said will be the fastest growing
segment its business, will see revenues and earnings jump by 35
percent in 2001 to about $10 billion as a result of the
acquisition, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue could double to $20 billion over the next several years,
Albaugh said.
</P>
<P>
   Space and Communications remains the smallest of Boeing's three
core groups. The other two groups are commercial airplanes and
military aircraft and missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The new unit will be named Boeing Satellite Systems and will be
part of the Space and Communications group headed by Albaugh.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, Boeing also gets two smaller businesses _
Hughes Electron Dynamics, a supplier of satellite components, and
Spectrolab, which makes satellite solar panels.
</P>
<P>
   The three businesses employ about 9,000 poeple, mostly in El
Segundo, Calif., the headquarters of Hughes Space and
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   During a teleconference with reporters, Condit, Albaugh and
Debby Hopkins, Boeing's chief financial officer, said the
acquisition will provide Boeing with new opportunities to grow the
company and increase profits in commercial and government
communication systems and services.
</P>
<P>
   Those new areas include space-based air traffic control
management systems that would allow airlines to monitor their
planes in flight.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also wants to use the Hughes acquisition to help it
develop so-called broadband communication services for commercial
planes. Passengers, for example, could easily tap into the Internet
during a flight.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believed Boeing paid too much for the business,
since the satellite unit had sales of about $2.3 billion in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But Hopkins said new tax regulations will allow Boeing to write
off $500 million of the purchase price, so Boeing is actually
paying $3.25 billion for the satellite maker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we have acquired a property at the right price,''
Hopkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has been talking about new ways to grow the company for
about a year, Hopkins said, and during that time Hughes Space and
Communications has always been its No. 1 acquisition priority, even
before it was on the market.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite maker is a unit of Hughes Electronics, which is
owned by General Motors Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the move is good for both Hughes and for Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes has wanted to sell the last part of its aerospace
business so it can focus on providing entertainment and data
information services. The cash from Boeing will allow Hughes to
invest more in DirecTV and in its planned Spaceway system to
provide Internet service from satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Albaugh said Hughes executives contacted Boeing last fall about
buying the satellite-making part of their business.
</P>
<P>
   He described the subsequent negotiations as ``on and off for
some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Boeing not bought Hughes, he said, Boeing would have had to
make other costly investments in new technology.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the acquisition, Albaugh said, Boeing is now well
positioned to be a significant player in emerging space and
communication markets.
</P>
<P>
   He described Hughes as a ``world class'' operation.
</P>
<P>
   Either the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission
will next review the deal for possible anti-trust problems. Boeing
said it hopes to close the sale in June if the government gives its
approval.
