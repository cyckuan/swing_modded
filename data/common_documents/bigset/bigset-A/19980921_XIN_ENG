<HEADLINE> Museveni Not to Pull out Troops Until Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni told listeners across the world via BBC Sunday evening
that Ugandan troops will not pull out of the Democratic Republic
of Congo (DRC) until the situation there stabilizes.
</P>
<P>
He made the announcement in response to questions from
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Uganda will maintain military presence in Congo (K) as long as
the matters there require. His army will not stay there if the
problem in Congo can be solved.
</P>
<P>
However, he failed to give a detailed plan for the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
African leaders are very sensible and Museveni thinks that
they will find a good solution to the problem, he added.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the cause for eruption of armed conflict in
Congo, he said the Congolese is in a better position to answer
the question.
</P>
<P>
As for the deployment of so many troops across the country and
the burden of this deployment on Ugandan economy, he said if they
did not take these measures, they would face worse problems.
</P>
<P>
The president also answered questions about the rebels of
Allied Democratic Forces and the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA)
which operate in the western and northern parts of the country
respectively.
</P>
<P>
He asserted the LRA rebels suffered so much in battles with
the government army that they shunned the government troops and
began to attack soft targets like unarmed civilians.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The anti-Taliban forces
launched a third rocket attack in a day injuring dozens of
civilians in a crowded market in the Afghan capital of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here Sunday evening said that the exact
number of the killed was not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Afghanistan's Bakhtar News Agency reported that at
least 16 people were killed and 40 others injured in a rocket
attack in Kabul's residential area called Khairkhana.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the rocket attacks were carried out by the
forces of opposition commander Ahmed Shah Masood.
</P>
<P>
The opposition rocket attack in Kabul came before the crucial
six plus two (Afghanistan's six immediate neighbors plus the U.S.
and Russia) meeting on the Afghan issue to take place in New York
Monday.

<HEADLINE> Zambians Urged not to Import Goods Available </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government Sunday
urged companies not to abuse foreign exchange by importing goods
available in the country.
</P>
<P>
Commerce, Trade and Industry Minister Enock Kavindele warned
that the government may be forced to regulate imports if the
firms continue to import the goods available in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
He noted that foreign exchange is being misused by importing
the commodities such as bananas, carrots and tomatoes, which are
available in the country.
</P>
<P>
We do understand that Zambia's economy is liberalized but
traders must make right decisions and also exercise self
restraint.
</P>
<P>
Because of reduced foreign exchange inflow, falling
international copper prices, slowing privatization process of its
copper mines and heavy burden of foreign debts, Zambia's currency
Kwacha has devalued drastically with 2,000 against one U.S.
Dollar compared with 1,400 against one Dollar early this year.
</P>
<P>
Zambia is very dependent on imports, the depreciation of
Kwacha has pushed up the prices of imported commodities, and
reduced the purchasing power of Zambians.
</P>
<P>
Foreign reserves of Zambia had dropped to 155 million Dollars
by last July from 227 million Dollars at the end of last year as
a result.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: All Eyes Set on "6+2" Meeting on Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 20 (Xinhua) -- All eyes are set on the
"six-plus-two" ministerial meeting called by the United Nations in
New York on Monday as Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz
apparently failed to help defuse the prevailing tension on the
Iran-Afghan border during his latest mission to Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The meeting to be held on the sidelines of the U.N. General
Assembly session Monday afternoon will be attended by six of
Afghanistan's neighbors, namely Iran, Pakistan, Tajikstan,
Turkmanistan, Uzbekistan and China plus Russia and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
It is the first such ministerial-level meeting under the
U.N.-sponsored formula, under which lower-ranking officials of
these countries have met occasionally since the end of last year
in a bid to end the protracted Afghan conflict.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming "six-plus-two" moot is crucial as the stand-off
between Iran and the Taliban militia, triggered by the murder of
seven Iranian diplomats in northern Afghanistan last month, poses
a threat to the peace and security of the region.
</P>
<P>
Declaring that it reserves the right of taking any action to
revenge, the Iranian government has already amassed 200,000 troops
near the Iran-Afghan border, equipped with tanks, heavy artillery,
helicopters and armored personnel carriers.
</P>
<P>
To counter the Iranian military build-up, the Taliban have also
reinforced their military position along their common border,
warning that they will attack Iranian cities with missiles if
Tehran initiates any military action against them. As a
consequence of this spiraling tension, the outbreak of an
Iran-Afghan war has emerged as a distinct possibility.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, despite Pakistan's repeated denials, Iran insists
that Islamabad is actively involved on the side of the Taliban in
Afghanistan and is also responsible for the "abhorrent killings"
of the Iranian diplomats. Most significantly, Iran's supreme
leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has issued a dire warning to the
Taliban and Pakistan that their actions in Afghanistan could
provoke a regional conflict.
</P>
<P>
In a message broadcast on state radio and television on
September 14, Khamenei said: "I have ... so far prevented the
lighting of a fire in this region which could be hard to
extinguish. But all should know that a very great and wide danger
is quite near."
</P>
<P>
On September 17, Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz paid an
unscheduled fence-mending visit to Tehran but it seems that he has
cut no ice with the Iranian government. He was reported to have
brought a letter from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, but was unable
to deliver it to Iranian President Mohammad Khatami who was not
available in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
By all accounts, as commented by Pakistan's major newspaper The
News, Aziz heard tough talk from the Iranian leaders he met and
was issued an unambiguous warning about the "darkening" in ties
between the two countries and about the growing popular pressure
in Iran to use the military option against the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Against such a backdrop, analysts here noted that the U.N.
Secretary General's move to call a six-plus-two conference has
assumed greater importance because this will entail direct talks
between all the countries which are directly affected by the
Afghan crisis.
</P>
<P>
If common sense prevails, the eight powers who meet in New
York should agree on a policy of non-interference in Afghanistan
and endeavor to pave the way for a new all-party peace dialogue in
the war-torn country, they said.
</P>
<P>
Particularly, they added that one hopes that the leaders of
Pakistan and Iran, the two most important players in the Afghan
peace process, will reach some understanding on how the Afghan
crisis is to be handled.

<HEADLINE> Primakov: Russia to Continue Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said Sunday that his country will stick to economic
reforms and political democracy but the government would make
"considerable corrections" for the good of the people.
</P>
<P>
"The course of reforms in Russia will undoubtedly be preserved
and continued," Primakov was quoted as saying in an interview with
the German newspaper Bild am Sonntag.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no return to the administrative-command system,"
Primakov said. "We will not yield an inch in the principle of
society's democratization and the protection of fundamental rights
and freedoms of citizens."
</P>
<P>
However, he said, there would be "considerable corrections in
our reforms and these corrections will be oriented to the needs of
the people."
</P>
<P>
He listed the payment of wage and pension arrears, expanded
sources of taxation to spur production and restructuring the
national economy as his government's priorities.
</P>
<P>
"The social tension in the country has reached a dangerous
limit," Primakov said, adding that efforts would be made to
convince the Russians that "strikes and disobedience campaigns of
the railroad blockade type do not solve problems, but just
aggravate the situation."
</P>
<P>
He said that"at some stage Russian reforms started lacking a
social component, no bridge was built between what was on the
whole a correct desire to put state finances in order and the real
needs of people, whose interests the state has proven unable to
protect."
</P>
<P>
Primakov said the government was still working on a program to
tide over the crisis, "but its principal, strategic elements are
evident to us."
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that on the basis of its implementation we will
be able to consolidate the society, tired of economic troubles and
political strife which have taken years," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 69-year-old former Foreign Minister, only a little over one
week into the new job, acknowledged that today's situation in
Russia is "undoubtedly complicated, to put it mildly."
</P>
<P>
"I was aware what was in store for me when I was accepting the
insistent proposal of the president of the Russian Federation,
Boris Yeltsin, that I head the Russian government. But the reality
has proven even more serious."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that he would not run in the 2000 presidential
race even though he was successful as head of the government.
</P>
<P>
"It is one of the conditions for an efficient work of my
cabinet," Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
While calling on his countrymen to fight civil apathy and try
to adapt to the new life, Primakov urged the outside word to
continue support Russia.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign support is necessary, very necessary," he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Thanks African Americans for Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton has thanked black Americans for "standing up for me and
understanding the true meaning of repentance and atonement."
</P>
<P>
Clinton, speaking at the annual dinner of the Congressional
Black Caucus Saturday, credited black legislators for supporting
his policies and helping to promote "this treasured moment of
prosperity and progress."
</P>
<P>
But Clinton laid out challenges yet to be conquered, everything
from containing the global financial crisis to expanding access to
health care and eliminating racism.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We cannot rest. We have work to do."
</P>
<P>
Clinton listed a number of areas in which minorities are
affected disproportionately, including certain health problems and
fair housing. Also he stressed the importance of making sure the
next census does not leave out many minorities.
</P>
<P>
The president opened his remarks by offering special thanks
"from the heart" to the caucus for its support in a time of
trouble.
</P>
<P>
Representative Maxine Waters, a Democrat and chairwoman of the
black caucus, got a standing ovation as she told her organization
that while blacks do not always agree with the president, "We
support Bill Clinton at this critical moment in his career,"
adding "It is because African Americans are uniquely qualified to
know unfairness when we see it."
</P>
<P>
She said of the Lewinsky investigation, "Let the word go forth:
The Congressional Black Caucus will be the fairness cops. We will
make sure at every step of the way Bill Clinton will have the
opportunity to lay his case out without being jeopardized."

<P>
BEIJING, September 20 (Xinhua)-- Shanghai Shenhua solided
their runners-up position with a 3-1 win over Chinese Army at the
22nd round competition of the Chinese first division soccer
league on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai was 13 points behind the defending champion and
league leader Dalian Wanda, who already retained their title in
advance on Thursday after beating Shandong Luneng 3-2.
</P>
<P>
Dalian became the first ever three-peat champion and won the
title four times in the five-year old Chinese professional leagu
e.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Shenhua, the winner of the 1994 season, is holding a
lead of five points over third-placed Beijing Guo'an, who blew a
2-0 first half lead and was drawn 2-2 by the strongly rallied

<HEADLINE> Holyfield Wins Decision over Bean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Evander Holyfield beat a
tough Vaughn Bean with a decision win in the heavyweight boxing
title fight on Saturday night in the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Holyfield, looking at times like an old fight, knocked Bean
down in the 10th round and won a unanimous decision over the
challenger before 41,357 home fans.
</P>
<P>
While Bean was fighting only his eighth opponent with a
winning record, Holyfield showed guile that comes from long years
of experience in the competition.
</P>
<P>
Bean pushed Holyfield into the ropes late in the 10th round
when the champion suddenly sidestepped Bean and flung him into
the ropes with his left arm. Holyfield landed a right to his
rival's head that floored him for a seven-count.
</P>
<P>
"He hit me when I was down," Bean said. "The referee didn't
do his job. I know I was on his hometown. He hit me right on the
temple. The referee could have stepped in."
</P>
<P>
"I've got to take advantage of every opportunity I get,
because he's a good fight," said Holyfield, who will bed 36 on
October 19."I just turned and hit him. That's part of the boxing
game."
</P>
<P>
Bean was ranked No. 1 by the IBF and was Holyfield's
mandatory challenger. Last March, Bean lost an IBF title bid
against then-champion Michael Moorer on a 12-round majority
decision. This time the decision wasn't close.
</P>
<P>
Judge Duane Ford scored it 116-111, while Al De Vito and
Leroy Brown each had it 117-111 for Holyfield. Holyfield found
the awkward Bean much tougher than most observers thought he
would be.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't come in overconfident, " Holyfield said. "I hit him
with good shots. He also hit me with good shots. You have to give
the man credit. The man came to fight. He's much better than
people gave him credit for. This was his day to shine."
</P>
<P>
Holyfield earned at least 5 million dollars for his 36th
victory against three defeats. He had 25 knockouts.
</P>
<P>
Bean lost for only the second time against 32 wins. His purse
was 1.8 million for his second IBF title bid.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Gains Much Economically: Museveni </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- President Yoweri Museveni
said here Sunday that Uganda has achieved much economically since
the National Resistance Movement took power in 1986.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks Sunday evening when answering questions
from listeners around the world via the British Broadcasting
Corporation (BBC).
</P>
<P>
Now Ugandans enjoy good supplies of goods and services and
they are not short of living necessities like sugar, salt,
transport and housing as they used to be, he said.
</P>
<P>
With the launch of Universal Primary Education program in
recent years, four children in each Ugandan family can receive
free primary education and thus the education level has been
enhanced among ordinary citizens.
</P>
<P>
AIDS, which used to be the key hindrance to the economic
development, becomes preventable with sensitization by the
government. The infection rate has dropped from 30 to 15
percent, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Museveni acknowledged that Uganda is still one of
the poorest countries in the world. He hoped more investment
will be made in the infrastructure like roads.
</P>
<P>
Only with the improvement of infrastructure, can the economy
be developed in the long run, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the hour-long interview, the president also answered
questions concerning the referendum slated for 2000, Uganda's
military presence in the Democratic Republic of Congo and his
country's national security.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Minister Warns against Job Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- About 19,000 jobs will be
lost and Zambia's economy distorted greatly if the country's
finance ministry does not reduce excise duty quickly on soft
drinks to avert an impending closure of Zambia Bottlers.
</P>
<P>
Enock Kavindele, Zambian Minister of Commerce, Trade and
Industry, warned here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference that his ministry has informed the
Finance Ministry that the current 25 percent excise duty on
carbonated drinks is not viable and recommended that it be
reduced to five percent.
</P>
<P>
If the Finance Ministry does not promptly address the case of
Zambia Bottlers, the manufacturers of Coca Cola products in the
country, Zambia's economy risks getting greatly impaired, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
According to him, Zambia Bottlers should not be looked upon as
an individual company but from the perspective of its
contribution to the Zambian economy.
</P>
<P>
This matter must be responded promptly because the complaints
received from Zambia Bottlers are very valid, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We do not look at Zambia Bottlers as a company but at its
contribution to the economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kavindele said many companies do business with Zambia Bottlers
and if the latter is closed, about 19,000 jobs will be lost in
Zambia and the economy will be greatly distorted.
</P>
<P>
"The impending closure of Coca Cola in Zambia will have a
domino effect on our economy. The company consumes 25 percent of
Zambian sugar worth 4.4 billion Kwacha (about 2.2 million U.S.
Dollars) and also pays 186 million Kwacha (93,000 Dollars) in
electricity bills, he said.
</P>
<P>
If Coca Cola closes down, Zambia will not only lose investment
opportunities but also business confidence, he said.
</P>
<P>
In May this year the government promised to reduce duty on
Coca Cola for Zambia Bottlers, which has not been honored up to
now, forcing the company to increase the price of its products
from 500 to 900 Kwacha.
</P>
<P>
The increased price has inevitably slumped the demand for the
products while retailers in some border areas have started
importing soft drinks from neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses US, Britain of Suspending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Baghdad on Sunday charged the
U.S. and Britain of deliberate failing to implement the
humanitarian purchases by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi news agency quoted a spokesman of the Iraqi Foreign
Ministry as saying that the U.S. and British delegates have
suspended 21 contracts included in the third phase of the
oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman pointed out that the U.S. and British delegates
are still blocking the enforcement of more purchase contracts, so
much so that the number of suspended fourth phase contracts has
reached 40 contracts.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed sanctions on Iraq in 1990 after its invasion
of Kuwait, but has allowed it to sell a certain amount of oil to
buy back food and medicines in six-month phases since the end of
1996.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman indicated that among the suspended contracts are
those for the purchase of foodstuffs, medicine and medical
appliances, spare parts for the electricity sector, and equipment
to treat potable and drainage waters.
</P>
<P>
He added that there are over 90 other contracts valued at 160
million U.S. dollars, but the financial coverage for these
contracts are still hanging due to the delay by U.N. organs in
transferring funds.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that this situation will obstruct the arrival of
humanitarian equipment to Iraq, negatively affecting the planned
distribution of monthly supplies and the provision of needed
medicine to Iraqi citizens.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said the Iraqi government is calling upon
the international community to pressure Washington and London to
refrain from such practices which flagrantly violate all
international and humanitarian conventions as well as the
Iraqi-related Security Council resolutions.

<HEADLINE> Iran Completes Deployment for Grand Maneuver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced on Sunday that
the army has completed its largest logistics, land and air
personnel deployment operations for the grand maneuver on the
eastern border with Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Deputy commander of the ground forces Brigadier General Hassan
Barati told the official news agency IRNA that the logistics,
armored and reinforcement units from 10 provinces across the
country arrived in the Zoulfaqar-2 maneuver operational zone
within 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
In order to evaluate the logistic capacity of the forces,
railroad facilities were not used for transportation and
deployment of the troops, Barati said.
</P>
<P>
He said all the required facilities including water,
foodstuffs, fuel, ammunition, tanks, and helicopter gun-ships have
been brought to the region.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian army announced to launch its biggest maneuver with
200,000 troops on the eastern border with Afghanistan following
the escalation of tension between Iran and the Afghan Taliban
militia over the killing of eight Iranian diplomats and a reporter
in Mazari Sharif in northern Afghanistan last month.
</P>
<P>
Commander of the army's ground forces Abdolali Pourshasb said
on September 12 that 40 percent of the 200,000 troops had been
deployed along the eastern border during the past month.
</P>
<P>
The week-long maneuver is to be carried out in an area of
5,000 square kilometers in the northeastern province of Khorasan
and the southeastern provinces of Sistan and Baluchestan.
</P>
<P>
The maneuver is said to start by the end of September.
However, Iranian officials refused to give the exact dates.
</P>
<P>
It will be the second grand maneuver on Iran's eastern border
this month. On September 1, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps
(IRGC) launched a ground-breaking maneuver with participation of
70,000 troops in Khorasan province and deployed the troops and
equipment involved in the maneuver in the border area.
</P>
<P>
Despite the massive military deployment, the moderate Iranian
government has expressed the hope to solve the problem with the
Taliban through peaceful diplomatic means.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Condemns U.S. Inspection of Ships Carrying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Iraq Sunday condemned the
U.S. marines' "illegal" inspection of ships in the Gulf carrying
foodstuffs and humanitarian needs for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Iraqi News Agency, a spokesman of the
Iraqi Foreign Ministry said that the U.S. and other forces in the
Gulf are persistently, but illegally, inspecting ships carrying
foodstuffs and other humanitarian needs for the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
These practices are in violation of the U.N. Charter and the
related Security Council resolutions, said the spokesman, whose
name was not given.
</P>
<P>
Describing such acts as aggression, he said that they are
seriously detrimental to Iraq and its people. They have caused
delays in the arrival of the ships, creating an atmosphere of
unrest which has directly led to a hike in insurance and transport
fees to Iraq, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that such aggressive practices negatively
affect the civilians and their chances of easy access to
foodstuffs, medicine and other humanitarian needs, consequently
furthering the suffering of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi Foreign Ministry has underlined that it will preserve
its right to take legal action to claim compensations for the
direct and indirect damages inflicted upon Iraq, in conformity
with the international laws, particularly the rules of
international obligation, the spokesman concluded.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Government Rejects Militia Conditional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese government Sunday
rejected pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army (SLA)'s proposal to
conditionally withdraw from its controlled Christian town of
Jezzine in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the proposal made on Saturday by SLA's leader
Antoine Lahd, Lebanese Minister of Transportation Omar Miskawi
said that Jezzine is not a special place compared with any other
area in south Lebanon, the official National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"As every Lebanese, we should be aware of what the enemy is
planning," he said at a news conference held in the country's
northern port city of Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
He urged SLA militia to pull out of Jezzine without any
preconditions as the country's call for an Israeli withdrawal from
south lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, Israel said it would withdraw its troops
from south Lebanon if the Lebanese government agrees to guarantee
its northern security.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon flatly rejected the offer, asking Israeli forces to
leave the country without any preconditions.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 to protect its north from cross-border attacks by
Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Lahd made a similar withdrawal proposal, saying
that his army is prepared to pull out from Jezzine if the
government agrees to send its troops to Jezzine and maintain
its security, and prevent the region from being used as a base for
operations against them.
</P>
<P>
The SLA has been policing Jezzine and helping Israeli forces
patrol its occupied security zone since it was established in
1985.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports said that the militia wants to give up
Jezzine, an area it has controlled for more than a decade, as it
recently suffered increasing casualties inside the area by
Hezbollah (Party of God) guerrillas bombing attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah is waging a guerrilla war trying
to oust 1,000 Israeli troops and 3,000 SLA militiamen out of
the country.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Says Considerable Progress Made in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that "considerable progress" had
been made on the Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank during
U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross' visit to the region, which
ended Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
"There was considerable progress on one issue...that was the
issue of the nature reserve. I hope it will be completed soon,"
Netanyahu told Israel Radio in an interview. He did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that Israel and the Palestinians have moved closer
on an Israeli proposal that it pullback its troops from 13
percent of the West Bank, as an American initiative demands, but
turn 3 percent of that land into a nature reserve, where Israel
will retain full security responsibility and the Palestinians are
not allowed to settle.
</P>
<P>
It has been reported that the Palestinians accepted the
principle of the nature reserve after Israel agreed to classify
the areas as an "Area B," guaranteeing that part of the Judean
Desert will eventually return to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said the main obstacle to an agreement was not on
the Israeli side, but was "persistent refusal" of the
Palestinians to fulfill their commitments to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to take
steps to crack down on the infrastructure of terrorist
organizations, reduce the size of its police force, confiscate
illegal weapons and reconvene the Palestinian National Council to
revise the Palestinian Covenant, parts of which call for
destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians say that they have fulfilled their
commitments to fight terrorism, accusing Israel of using the
security issue as an excuse to delay its withdrawal from the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's remarks came one day after Ross ended his 11 days
of shuttle diplomacy, during which he held several rounds of talks
with Netanyahu and PNA President Yasser Arafat, as well as other
key figures in the Israeli-Palestinian talks.
</P>
<P>
In his last effort before departing for Washington late
Saturday night, Ross held separate talks with Arafat and
Netanyahu and was relieved to hear that the two agreed in
principle to hold direct talks.
</P>
<P>
Both Arafat and Netanyahu will be in New York later this week
to attend the U.N. General Assembly. Washington has expected such
a summit to take place and the two leaders could seal a deal over
the long overdue Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu reiterated in the interview that he would not oppose
to meeting Arafat, but said that "a meeting is one thing, the
substance of the meeting is another thing."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the sexual scandal surrounding U.S. President
Bill Clinton, which analysts say has cast a shadow over Ross'
visit, Netanyahu said he hoped the Americans could put the
scandal behind them as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
A prolonged crisis in Washington will cause great instability
in the Middle East, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Two British aid workers held
hostage in Chechnya were freed on Sunday after 14 months in
captivity, the Foreign Office said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said hostages Camilla Carr and Jon James were
understood to be in good health despite their ordeal and were
expected to arrive in London Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a statement he was
delighted by the release.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to pay a tribute to Camilla and Jon for the
courage they have shown through this most distressing ordeal,"
Cook said.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Office, which worked closely with Russia's central
and regional governments for the release, said it could not give
precise details of when Carr and James would be back in Britain.
"This depends very much on their wishes and those of their
families.
</P>
<P>
"Our objective is, of course, to get them home and reunited
with their families as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
The two persons were held in an undisclosed location after they
were captured by unknown gunmen in the Chechen capital Grozny in
July 1997.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of hostages, including several foreigners, are
currently held hostage in Chechnya, which was devastated by a war
in 1994-96 in which Russia tried to subdue the region's
independence bid.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Warlord Charged With Treason in Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Liberian government has said
it has charged 22 persons with treason, including former warlor
Roosevelt Johnson, after heavy fighting left scores dead in
capital Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here quoted President Charles Taylor as
saying Saturday that some of the fugitives sought by the
government had been granted asylum at the U.S. Embassy, and
called on the embassy to turn them over.
</P>
<P>
Residents said Johnson, Taylor's major rival during Liberia's
seven-year civil war, was among those at the U.S. Embassy, but
the embassy did not comment, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Information Minister Joe Mulbah said in a radio broadcast that
the 22 include another former warlord, Alhaji Kromah, Bal Gbala,
an adviser to Taylor, and Vamba Kanneh, a one-time member of the
government.
</P>
<P>
"Intelligence reports have confirmed the recruitment and
training of dissident groups for the sole purpose of subverting
the government under the supervision of Johnson and his
collaborators," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mulbah said the Justice Ministry was asking the accused to
turn themselves in to any police station.
</P>
<P>
"Any group of persons harboring the accused must turn them
over immediately to the nearest police station with notice to the
Ministry of Justice."
</P>
<P>
"Failure to do so, such persons or group of persons will be
construed as collaborators and will be dealt with as such," the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Heavy fighting broke out in central Monrovia Friday night and
continued until early Saturday, as government security forces
moved into the Camp Johnson Road to dislodge Johnson's
supporters.
</P>
<P>
Taylor and Johnson have been trading accusations recently.
While Taylor accused Johnson of plotting to topple him, Johnson
had claimed assassination threats from Taylor.
</P>
<P>
Freed American slaves founded Liberia as modern Africa's
first republic in 1847. Their descendants ruled the country
until Master Sergeant Sammel Doe, a Krahn, seized power in a
1980 coup. He was killed early in the civil war.

<HEADLINE> PNA Official Criticizes Ladani's Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian
official strongly criticized on Sunday an Israeli court's
decision to release Avshalom Ladani suspected of shooting and
killing a Palestinian youth on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Al-Tibi, advisor to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
Israeli affairs, told the Voice of Palestine that Ladani's
release shows Israel's true intention of "granting the green
light to these settlers to riot in Palestinian territories and to
open fire at random against the Palestinian people."
</P>
<P>
Ladani, a 35-year-old settler of Dolev Settlement in the West
Bank, surrendered to Jerusalem police Thursday evening and
admitted that he had opened fire toward Palestinian students
near Ramallah the same day, in which a Palestinian student was
killed.
</P>
<P>
He also told the police that other settlers in his car, which
was stoned by the students, also opened fire toward the students
and he was sure that one student was killed by his shooting.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Magistrate Court decided Sunday to release
Ladani and put him under "house arrest" in a Jerusalem hostel
pending further charges till next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ladani was remanded by the court on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem police said that the investigation is going on and
the police has yet to determine if Ladani fired in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side said that Israel was to blame for the
shooting and demanded that Ladani be turned over to it to stand
trial.
</P>
<P>
The killing incident triggered bloody clashes Friday between
the Palestinians and Israeli security forces in Ramallah with
many Palestinians calling for revenge.

Kuwaiti Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of State for

<HEADLINE> Israelis Celebrate Jewish New Year Amid Tight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Israelis celebrated the
beginning of the Jewish new year Sunday evening as thousands of
police and security forces are on high alert to prevent possible
terror attacks.
</P>
<P>
It is like an ordinary Shabbat, which is the Jewish weekend
and a day of rest. Family members gather at home, religious
people go to pray in synagogues, and the secular people play
music and drive on the streets as usual.
</P>
<P>
But there is an air of excitement in every Jewish home. Mother
lights the candles and recites blessings, family members eat
sweet food wishing everyone else a good and sweet year. There are
more people in synagogues than Shabbats.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police and security forces, however, could not enjoy
their vacation on Rosh Hashana, or the beginning of the new year,
this time.
</P>
<P>
They were deployed on crowed areas in big cities and
checkpoints in Gaza and the West Bank in an effort to foil any
possible terror attacks which the Palestinian resistance movement,
Hamas, has threatened to stage.
</P>
<P>
Gaza and the West Bank would remain totally closed until the
Jewish new year ends Tuesday night, and the Palestinians are
allowed to cross the checkpoints only in cases of emergency.
</P>
<P>
The closure, which was imposed more than one week ago after
Hamas threatened to avenge the killing of two of its military
leaders by Israeli soldiers, was briefly eased last week.
</P>
<P>
After Hamas renewed its threats to kidnap Israeli soldiers and
blow up car bombs in big cities, the Israeli army sealed off Gaza
and the West Bank again Friday. Israeli security forces were on
high alert nationwide.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 Palestinians have been injured in clashes with
Israeli soldiers in the West Bank since the death of Adel and
Imad Awadallah brothers.
</P>
<P>
When Israelis say "Shana Tova", good new year, to each others,
they probably wish for a new year in which they will see fewer
conflicts and will no longer live under terror threats.

<HEADLINE> Sudan to Mediate Between Iran, Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Sudan has offered to mediate
between Iran and the Afghan Taliban militia in an effort to
prevent their crisis from developing into military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
The press adviser of the Sudanese president, Al Sadeq Bakheit
said Sunday that the idea of Sudanese mediation has emerged as an
attempt to bring about rapprochement.
</P>
<P>
The Sudan will send within two days two delegations, an
official one to Tehran and another non-official one to Kabul. They
will carry letters to Iranian and Taliban leaders, appealing for
non escalation of the current conflict to confrontation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Bakheit quoted the letters as reading that "any negative
development will be in the interest of the enemies of the Islamic
nation, and will not serve the cause of either country nor the
Islamic world."
</P>
<P>
Sudan will call upon the two sides to resort to diplomatic
channels to resolve their differences, he said.
</P>
<P>
Denying some reports, Bakheit stressed that Sudan is leaning
towards neither side of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The tension between Iran and the Taliban heightened recently
after the Taliban killed nine Iranian diplomats and reporter in
northern Afghanistan. Amassing troops on border, Tehran threatens
to take revenge.
</P>
<P>
On Iran's attitude towards Sudan's mediation, a delegation
source said it was "encouraging," adding he has received
assurances that Tehran would not resort to force until it
exploited all diplomatic means to resolve the crisis."

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan,
the Regent, warned here Sunday that a sectarian war might occur in
western Asia if Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan do not contain the
current tension on their borders, Jordan's official news agency,
the Petra, reported.
</P>
<P>
Escalation of the ongoing tension at the
Iranian-Afghan-Pakistani borders might lead to a sectarian war,
which will adversely affect the situation in the nearby Islamic
countries and threaten regional security and stability, the
Petra quoted Hassan as telling Lieutenant General Faseeh Bukkari,
Chief of Staff of the Pakistani Marine Forces.
</P>
<P>
The three countries should try their best to curb the tension
and settle the differences through peaceful means and on the
basis of international legitimacy, said the regent.
</P>
<P>
Jordan as a country in the region is worried about the strained
situation among Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan, he added.
</P>
<P>
Bukkari is in Amman on a brief visit.
</P>
<P>
The tension between Iran and the Afghan Taliban militia has
escalated since the killing of eight Iranian diplomats and a
reporter by the Taliban last month.
</P>
<P>
More than 200,000 Iranian troops have been stationed at the
Iranian-Afghan border. Iran has threatened retaliation against the
Taliban by taking military actions.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan on Friday declared that it will remain neutral in any
conflict between Iran and the Taliban.

<P>
LUSAKA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba consulted Sunday with his Rwandan counterpart Pasteur
Bizimungu in Kigali in an effort to end the civil war in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Chiluba did not disclose the details of the meeting but said
the talks lasting for two hours went on very well, the television
here reported Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa flew to Kigali
for similar talks with Rwandan leaders on the latest effort to
end the fighting in Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
Returning from Rwanda Sunday afternoon, Chiluba said he was
satisfied with the consultations respectively held with Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni in Entebbe of Uganda on Saturday and
with Rwandan leaders in Kigali on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said so much has been achieved and they all emerged
very optimistic about the talks but there is still need for more
consultations with the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) leaders.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, nobody will be satisfied until peace is
achieved in Congo.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said he will inform the leaders of the cease-fire
modalities in Congo concluded in Entebbe on Sunday by presidents
of Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
He also said the SADC leaders will also be briefed on the
withdrawal of foreign troops from the vast central African
country.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian and Zambian presidents are considered as neutral in
the Congo conflict and were mandated to spearhead the Congo peace
drive by the SADC summit held last week in Grand Baie of
Mauritius.
</P>
<P>
Three SADC countries, Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia, dispatched
troops to Congo to prop up President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Kabila has been accusing Rwanda and Uganda of invading to
overtly give military support to the anti-Kabila rebels who took
up arms against Kabila on August 2.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese President Rejects U.S. Threats of New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar
al-Bashir Sunday reiterated Sudan's right to respond forcefully to
any new U.S. attacks, other than resorting to the U.N. Security
Council and other international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a huge mass rally on the occasion of the lapse of
one month since the U.S. air strike against a pharmaceutical
factory in Khartoum, al-Bashir categorically rejected new threats
by the U.S. to launch new strikes against his country.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. launched the attack on the factory on the ground that
it manufactures chemical weapons agents for terrorists. The
Sudanese government insists the plant only produces antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
The sudanese president said that the U.S. threats were issued
under the pretext that Sudan is hosting terrorist groups to
undermine American interests worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Al-Bashir underlined that such threats do not intimidate the
Sudanese nation. Instead, they will rather enhance the nation's
strength, determination and will to confront aggression and
provocations, he added.
</P>
<P>
Such threats will also further the nation's belief and
adherence to its economic development plans and political efforts,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Bashir revealed that the message received by the Sudanese
government from the U.S. administration threatened to hit Sudan in
case of any attacks against American interests and facilities all
over the world.
</P>
<P>
He said that Sudan's hostility to the U.S. emanates from
Washington's attempts to impose hegemony on Sudan and to force the
Sudanese people to abandon their religion and independent
decision-making.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that a U.S. government official conveyed a
message to a Sudanese official, which holds Sudan responsible for
any attack against U.S. citizens anywhere in the world. It
demanded the expulsion of terrorism elements from Sudan or handing
them over to stand trial in the U.S. or any other country.

KHARTOUM, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar

<P>
He reiterated Sudan's right to respond forcefully to any fresh
U.S. attacks, other than resorting to the U.N. Security Council or
other international organization.
</P>
<P>
He was addressing a huge mass meeting Sunday on the occasion of

</P>
<P>
Such threats will fail to intimidate or terrorize the Sudanese
nation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Bashir revealed that the threat was contained in an unsigned
message received from the U.S. Administration. Washington
threatened to hit Sudan in case of any attacks against
U.S. interests and facilities the world over, he said.
</P>

News reports said the message had been conveyed by a

on an Israeli proposal that it pullback its troops from 13

<HEADLINE> EU Deplores Failure of Working Time Negotiation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Monday that it was disappointed by the failure of the negotiations
to reach agreement on working time.
</P>
<P>
European Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock and Social Affairs
Commissioner Padraig Flynn said in a joint statement that a great
opportunity had been missed.
</P>
<P>
The Federation of Transport Workers Unions in the European
Union and the International Road Union met here Monday in a
desperate effort to reach agreement on working hours for the
mobile sector of the EU's road transport.
</P>
<P>
But the two organizations, representing the truck, coach and
taxi drivers and employers respectively, failed to agree with each
other.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
European Union, said that it would have to table its own proposals
on working time if there is no agreement on September 30.
</P>
<P>
The commission suggested that the two organizations meet again
on September 30 to make a final attempt at reaching agreement.
</P>
<P>
The European Council of Ministers set forth in 1993 a
regulation concerning working time for all sectors except for road
transport. The commission suggested last year to extend the
working time regulation to all non-mobile workers in the road
transport sector.
</P>
<P>
The commission provided those directly involved in road
transport with an opportunity to reach agreement for themselves,
commission officials said.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the officials added, had wished that the social
partners of labor and management could jointly find acceptable
solutions for themselves.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations, that kept on and off for several months, led
to two strike-triggered road blockades by French hauliers that had
seriously hampered the trade within the European Union.

<HEADLINE> Annan: Reform Essential for Better U.N. Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Reform of the United
Nations "is essential if we are to play our full part in the new
era," U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Reform is an ongoing process, and I shall continue working on
ways to improve our performance," he said at the opening of the
two-week general debate of the 53rd session of the General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Annan hammered out U.N. reform programs, described as a process
of "quiet revolution," shortly after he took office in January
1997. However, the U.N. capacities were limited due to financial
stringency caused by failure of few countries to pay their back
dues.
</P>
<P>
"But the single greatest impediment to good performance is the
financial straitjacket within we are obliged to operate," he said.
"Financial stringency is a feature of today's world: it has helped
concentrate our minds on giving you better value for your money.
But without money there can be no value. Stringency is one thing:
a starvation diet quite another."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief once again appealed to "those few member states
who have fallen seriously behind with their contributions, to
follow the good example set by others." "There can be no
substitute for full and timely payment of what is due," he added.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said last week that by September
15, the outstanding contributions reached 2.4 billion U.S.
dollars, of which 1.6 billion U.S. dollars are owed by the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, a non-profit world body, fully relies on
contributions from member states to finance its operations.

<HEADLINE> Mogadishu Situation Still Volatile  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though real reason for the fighting is not known, an
eyewitness in the market said the shooting began when a group
of militiamen on a battle wagon arrived at the khat-selling
kiosks ostensibly to buy some khat at a time when there was
another group of infantry gunmen in the market probably for the
same reason.
</P>
<P>
The eyewitness could not clarify who started the shooting,

but described the incident as suspicion-provoked clash.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have earlier in the year clashed several times
in the same area for somewhat political reasons.
</P>
<P>
The deceased include two women and a money exchange dealer,

all innocent civilians, caught in the cross fire.
</P>
<P>
In another similar clash, at least two people were wounded

and all of the business activities came to a total stagnation

in the port town of Merca Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses, the trouble started when the
guards of the market in Merca Town, 100 km south of Mogadishu,
caught two men allegedly for theft practice and whipped
them.
</P>
<P>
Gunmen at the police station of the town were reported to have
been annoyed by the apprehension made by the guards of the market
and have tried to round up the market security men to arrest.
</P>
<P>
The move by the police force then provoked the two groups
to fire upon each other. The market security men have wounded
two men on the police vehicle and captured the police vehicle.

<HEADLINE> UN to Deliver 47,000 Tons of Food to Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The visiting delegation
of the World Food Program (WFP) Monday expressed that the UN
organization plans to give 47,000 tons of relief food for
Ethiopians whose crops were damaged due to climate change.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, the remarks were made
when Mohammed Zajjari, WFP Director for Africa, held here talks
with Simon Mechael, Commissioner of Disaster Prevention and
Preparedness of Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The nine-member delegation of WFP's executive board arrived
here Sunday for a five-day official visit for emergency and
development food aid projects in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. government signed here Monday an agreement
to provide 16,000 tons of relief food and 36,000 blankets valued
at 10 million U.S. Dollars to Ethiopians displaced by border
dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. donation was a response to the June 15, 1998 official
appeal issued by the Disaster Prevention and Preparedness
Commission to help it meet the needs of tens of thousands of war
displaced people.
</P>
<P>
The number of displaced Ethiopians of border dispute was over
200,000, according to an official announcement last month.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair on Monday urged the International Monetary Fund and world
financial institutions to take reform to improve their performance.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to be delivered later in the day to the New York
Stock Exchange, Blair proposed a one-year deadline for the
financial reform.
</P>
<P>
"I believe we should set ourselves a deadline of one year in
which this work should be done, so that we can have the reformed
institutions in place before the Millennium.
</P>
<P>
"Firm proposals should be put to the (G7) Heads of Government
Summit next year and then to a wider forum next September," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also listed five reform priorities -- greater accountability
and transparency, better financial supervision and regulation, the
response to short-term liquidity crises, the handling of
international capital flows, and the openness and accountability
of the IMF itself.
</P>
<P>
Blair said G7 heads of government should be active in pushing
ahead this agenda.
</P>
<P>
"We should not be afraid to think radically and fundamentally.
We need to commit ourselves today to build a new Bretton Woods for
the next millennium," he said.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho PM Still in Maseru at Helm of Govt: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho 's ruling
party, Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD), was still in power
and governing the country with Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili
at its helm, Mosisili's deputy Kelebone Maope said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Reports that Mosisili and senior cabinet ministers had fled
the country were false, South African Press Association (SAPA)
quoted Maope as saying in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister is still here in Maseru. The government
has not been unseated."
</P>
<P>
Maope said the government was still willing to hold talks with
opposition parties, despite their boycott of a meeting earlier
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The LCD government was the legitimate government of Lesotho
and had appealed to the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) for assistance, Maope added.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether this would include a SADC peacekeeping force in
view of the fact that elements of the Lesotho Defense Force were
no longer loyal to the government, he said: "I don't know."
</P>
<P>
South Africa's The Star newspaper reported Monday morning that
there was a coup in Lesotho and that opposition parties had
overthrown the Mosisili government.
</P>

It also reported that Mosisili and several senior cabinet
ministers had fled the country.

<HEADLINE> India Rules Out Roll Back of Nuclear Weapons Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 21 (Xinhua) -- India Monday ruled out any
roll back of the nuclear weapons program.
</P>
<P>
The total yield generated by three simultaneous explosions in
May comprising a hydrogen bomb, an atom bomb and a sub-kiloton
nuclear device, was 60 kilotons, said Scientific Adviser to the
Defense Minister P. J. Adbul Kalam.
</P>
<P>
India had come a long way since it conducted its first nuclear
test in 1974 as the country's scientists had been working on the
data base to improve the design of nuclear weapons and modernize
them, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kalam, who is also chief of Defense Research and Development
Organization (DRDO), said that the required data have been
obtained through the five nuclear tests in May this year for
carrying out simulation for future development by the scientists
and technologists.
</P>
<P>
The country had several super computers in various research
institutions including the Atomic Energy Commission and there
would be no hurdle on this score, he added.
</P>
<P>
India by signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) would
not face any difficulties in its nuclear weapons program since the
country has generated the desired data from its recent nuclear
tests.
</P>
<P>
"We are capable of conducting underground sub-critical tests
after signing the CTBT, if necessary," he said.
</P>
<P>
"From the scientific and technical angle, it is our considered
view that no further nuclear tests are necessary and subscribing
to the CTBT would not create difficulties for our nuclear status,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Opposition Denies Coup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho opposition
parties Monday denied a South African newspaper report that they
had overthrown the government of Prime Minister Pakalitha
Mosisili and taken charge of the mountain kingdom in a coup.
</P>
<P>
The Star newspaper reported Monday morning that the opposition
alliance had staged a coup and quoted Lesotho Foreign Minister
Tom Thabane as saying that his government had been unseated.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also reported that Mosisili and several other
ministers had fled the country. It said opposition alliance
spokeswoman Mamello Morrison had confirmed that the opposition
had taken charge of Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
However, South African Press Association (SAPA) quoted
Morrison as saying: "The (newspaper) report is a poor attempt at
sensationalism and is a highly irresponsible statement. As far as
a coup is concerned they are telling a blatant lie. There is no
coup in Lesotho."
</P>
<P>
Morrison said she had told The Star's reporter only that the
government had abandoned control of the country and that the
opposition would soon be in control.
</P>
<P>
"I said nothing of a coup. I am a former journalist and a
woman of sober habits. The reporter who claimed I said this
either needs training in the English language or on how to
interpret information."
</P>
<P>
Morrison said opposition demonstrators Monday again gathered
at the gates of the royal palace in Maseru to continue their
protest against the outcome of Lesotho's general election in May.
</P>
<P>
"We are singing, the normal contingent of army personnel is
still here. There is no coup in the country."
</P>
<P>
South African officials were unable to confirm the coup
report.
</P>
<P>
According to SAPA, army officers stood guard at the entrance
of Mosisili's residence Monday morning and there were no
indication that the prime minister had fled the country.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan's Foreign Trade Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan's foreign trade
in the first half of the year reached 7.2 billion U.S. dollars, a
5 percent increase over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The National Statistics Bureau said imports increased by 15
percent to 4.03 billion dollars while exports dropped 5 percent to
worth 3.16 billion dollars, marking a trade deficit of 873 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth of Independent States was the country's most
important export market, taking up 42.9 percent of the total
volume, with Russia taking a share of 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) came second with 33.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Influenced by the Southeast Asian financial crisis and a global
drop in crude oil prices, Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
economies and Southeast Asia ranked third and fourth respectively.
</P>
<P>
Exports to the entire Southeast Asia totaled 7.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months, 43.3 percent of Kazakhstan's total
imports came from Russia, its traditional largest trade partner.
</P>
<P>
Other main import sources were the EU, APEC and Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Experts expect that by the end of the year, imports could reach
7.76 billion dollars, while exports could be 6.67 billion dollars,
if the trading momentum of the first half of the year is
maintained.

<HEADLINE> HK Tourist Arrivals in August Hit 15-Month High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Tourist arrivals in Hong
Kong hit a 15-month high in August and also registered
year-on-year growth for the second consecutive month this year,
according to figures released by the Hong Kong Tourist Association
(HKTA) Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 859,310 visitors were up 4.9 percent from August 1997 and
were the highest monthly arrivals since May 1997, HKTA said.
</P>
<P>
"This is encouraging," said HKTA Executive Director Amy Chan.
</P>
<P>
"While the economic problem in the region will continue to have
a negative impact on travel, we are hopeful this modest recovery
can be sustained," Chan said.
</P>
<P>
"Relatively speaking, Hong Kong is holding its own in its
margin above other regional destinations, and continues to be the
most popular destination in Asia after China's mainland," she
said.
</P>
<P>
The biggest growth market in August was China's mainland -- up
35.1 percent to 267,839 visitors.
</P>
<P>
This was due partly to the 30 percent increase in the tour
group quota, which came into effect on July 1 this year, as well
as in contrast to the restricted travel from the mainland this
time last year, Chan said.
</P>
<P>
Other markets that showed good growth in August were the
Netherlands, up 32.6 percent to 4,939 visitors, Britain, up by
22.9 percent to 22,036, and Canada, up 13 percent to 14,332.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chan said the HKTA welcomes Hong Kong's Cathay
Pacific Airways' alliance with other major world airlines.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Cathay Pacific, British Airways, American Airlines,
Canadian Airlines and Qantas of Australia announced a loose
alliance called "oneworld" to integrate some of their customer
services for the global marketplace.
</P>
<P>
Chan said this alliance will be a boom to travelers coming to
Hong Kong, easing transfers and opening up new source markets. It
also further consolidates Hong Kong as the regional aviation hub.
</P>
<P>
"The HKTA looks forward to establishing new marketing
initiatives with Cathay Pacific's alliance partners," she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee would not support the plan to create a European Super
League, arguing it would monopolize income at the expense of
smaller clubs.
</P>
<P>
An IOC delegation headed by President Juan-Antonio Samaranch
told European Union officials the lucrative television deals
planned under the super league would not profit soccer as a whole.
</P>
<P>
"This is why a project like the Super League would be
dangerous since it would concern a select club of top teams and
the money they would generate would not trickle down to the
provincial clubs," said Jacques Rogge, the head of the European
Olympic Committees.
</P>
<P>
"Our point is that the collective negotiations of television
rights is the only way to let money filter through from the top
level of sports to the grassroots," Rogge said.
</P>
<P>
The IOC called on the EU's Executive Commission to make sure
an equitable system of revenue distribution continues to exist.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Main Opposition Wins District Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The main opposition
Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML) Monday
emerged the winner again in the polls held last Friday in the 11
districts of the mid-western development region.
</P>
<P>
Results show that the CPN-UML bagged five posts of chairman in
Dailekh, Surkhet, Mugu, Jumla and Dolpa in addition to seven posts
of vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
The party won the posts of both chairman and vice chairman in
Dailekh, Surkhet, Mugu and Dolpa.
</P>
<P>
Besides, its 48 candidates were elected members of the district
development committees (DDC) in all the 11 districts. And in
Dolpa, the party won all the nine posts of member, a party
official said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 11 chairmen and 11 vice chairmen along with 116
members were elected for the DDCs in Dolpa, Mugu, Humla, Jumla,
Kalikot, Dang, Piuthan, Banke, Bardiya, Dailekh and Surkhet.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Nepali Congress (NC) was the runner-up with four
chairman posts in Dang, Banke, Bardiya and Humla and one vice
chairman post.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two of the NC's candidates were elected members in some
districts.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of Nepal (Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML), which
broke away from the CPN-UML in March this year and joined the
government in late August, did not win a single key post.
</P>
<P>
It lost even in Bardiya district, the constituency of its
General Secretary Bam Dev Gautam where the NC and the CPN-UML
formed an alliance.
</P>
<P>
Political parties formed alliance with one another in the
elections considered crucial for them in the general elections due
to be held before November 1999.
</P>
<P>
Polls were not held last year in these districts because
elections for village development committees (VDC) there were not
completed due to violence by the ultra-leftist guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Polls were held last year respectively for VDCs and
municipalities in May and DDCs in July in 56 of the 75 districts
in Nepal, in which the CPN-UML won a landslide victory.
</P>
<P>
But most of the mayors, deputy mayors, DDC chairmen, vice
chairmen and members elected at that time have joined the CPN-ML.
</P>
<P>
As the CPN-ML and the splinter group of the National Democratic
Party (RPP) led by former prime minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand
are yet to be recognized by the Election Commission as national
parties, their candidates contested the elections as independents.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Jiangsu Expects Double-Digit Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Residents in east China's
Jiangsu Province have conquered rampant summer flooding and are
working diligently to achieve this year's annual growth
target of 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
Chen Huanyou, secretary of the Provincial Committee of the
Communist Party of China and chairman of the Standing Committee of
the Provincial People's Congress, made the comments on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chen said Jiangsu's years of efforts to build water
conservancy facilities enabled the province to escape casualties
and maintain the integrity of levees during heavy summer flooding.
</P>
<P>
The province maintained economic development efforts throughout
the taxing flood season, said Chen, adding that Jiangsu has
adopted substantive measures for investment, consumption and exports.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu's gross domestic product (GDP) for the first six months
grew by eight percent on the previous year's period, with
accelerated growth recorded for both July and August.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that extensive efforts will be made to ensure
agricultural and industrial growth.
</P>
<P>
The province has invested heavily in infrastructure
construction, including roads and bridges, power generation
projects, and telecommunications and environmental protection
facilities, said Chen.
</P>
<P>
For example, Jiangsu has spent over 40 billion yuan to
construct expressways stretching over 1,000 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
He said Jiangsu has successfully dealt with the negative
impacts of the ongoing financial turmoil in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade figures for the first eight months of the year
hit 16.87 billion U.S. dollars, up 14 percent on the 1997 period,
with exports growing by 10.7 percent to 11.2 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investments grew by 6.1 percent and ended the period at
4.58 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Australia Election Campaign: Labor Party Closes Gap, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Labor Party
(ALP) has narrowed the gap but the ruling coalition would have won
an election held last weekend, the latest poll in this week's
Bulletin magazine has found.
</P>
<P>
The poll by Mark Textor's Australasian Research Strategies
found the coalition, comprising the Liberal Party and National
Party, would have suffered a swing of only 2.2 percent last
weekend, returning John Howard with a majority of about 20 seats.
</P>
<P>
However it found primary support for the ALP surged by two
points in the third week of the campaign to 36 percent, still five
points behind the coalition on 41 percent of primary votes.
</P>
<P>
On a two-party basis, the coalition led 51.5 percent to Labor's
48.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the Bulletin poll is the only remaining major poll to
put the coalition ahead, with Newspoll and AC Nielsen placing the
ALP marginally ahead.
</P>
<P>
As the campaign for the October 3 election heads into the
fourth week, the coalition will keep the focus of its re-election
strategy on its work for the dole scheme.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard Sunday announced a further 100
million Australian dollars (59 million U.S. dollars) over four
years to extend the work for the dole scheme to year 12 students
without work or not in training three months after finishing
school.
</P>
<P>
But the proposal has drawn criticism from ALP, which said the
government was seeking to portray the scheme as a solution to
youth unemployment to divert attention from the high rate of
joblessness among young people.
</P>
<P>
Opposition leader Kim Beazley, who has flagged employment as
the most important issue for the campaign, said Howard's election
platform would not provide a single job and he was reinforcing
failure by expanding the scheme.
</P>
<P>
Promoting his tax reform in Sydney, Howard warned that the
nation would pay a price by becoming a weaker and more vulnerable
economy if it did not reform its tax system.
</P>
<P>
"We have seen with Japan what happens when economies turn away
from necessary reform. If the Japanese had fixed their banking
system eight or nine years ago, Japan would now be a lot stronger
and would not be seen as being in real difficulty," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he had a plan that includes a goods and services tax
package. That may not be popular or easy, but it is in the voters'
interest to have a stronger economy which could withstand
international economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Kim Beazley, while hitting back at claims that Labor had no
plan for tax reform, said his party's tax credit system was the
only new idea being put forward in the election campaign.
</P>
<P>
"We have substantial tax reform policies, including the only
new idea on offer and that's our 10 cents in the dollar tax credit
for the bulk of Australian families and for workers," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to about 500 members of Chinese community in
Sydney, Beazley stepped up his attack on the government's approach
to One Nation Party, highlighting Labor's multi-culturalism
credentials.
</P>
<P>
Beazley accused the coalition of cowardice and immorality for
feeding preferences to Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party at
Queensland election, in which the One Nation Party won 11 state MP
seats.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia, S. Africa to Promote Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 21 (Xinhua) -- A Saudi Arabian trade
delegation, headed by Minister of Industry and Electricity Hashim
Yamani, arrived in South Africa Monday to promote trade between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The trade delegation, the first of its kind since Saudi Arabia
and South Africa established diplomatic relations two years ago,
hoped to establish direct links with South African businesses,
Soud Zedan, a councilor at the Saudi Embassy told the media at
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia was keen to have a cooperation agreement on
security, science and technology, Zedan said.
</P>
<P>
Yamani is scheduled to give the opening address at the two-day
Saudi Arabia trade show in Midrand, which will be the first Saudi
trade exhibition in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Items on display will include electrical and metal products,
tools, machinery, building products, medical equipment, and
banking services.
</P>
<P>
Zedan said his government initiated the fair to introduce
South Africans to a variety of products made in Saudi Arabia,
which is mainly known for its oil.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, one of the fastest-growing economies in the
world, has launched a massive drive to create additional sources
of national income in addition to oil.
</P>
<P>
Zedan said his country hoped to become a significant supplier
of oil to South Africa and an important customer of the armaments
industry.
</P>
<P>
Last year Saudi Arabia exported 23.38 million U.S. Dollars
worth of products to South Africa, a 38 percent increase from the
previous year. The exports were mainly oil, chemicals and
plastics.
</P>
<P>
South African exports to Saudi Arabia were worth 117 million
U.S. Dollars in 1997, 69 percent more than that of 1996.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea to Close 13 More Overseas Missions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 21 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will shut down 13
more overseas diplomatic missions by the end of this year to
reduce spending in foreign currency, the South Korean foreign and
trade ministry said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the embassies of South Korea in Jamaica,
Trinidad and Tobago, Bolivia, Yemen and Bahrain will be closed and
their affairs will be taken over by missions in neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
The nation will also close consulates general in six cities --
Karachi, Anchorage, Miami, Hagatna in Guam, Hamburg and Las Palmas
while the mission to the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization in Paris will be merged with the South Korean embassy
there. The consulate general in Berlin will be integrated into the
South Korean embassy in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
The shutdown will reduce the number of the nation's overseas
diplomatic missions to 125 by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, South Korea closed or merged
six embassies and consulates general.
</P>
<P>
The government will be able to save some 10 million U.S.
dollars a year by closing or merging the missions.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has been in a serious financial crisis triggered by
corporate failures and bad loans of financial institutions since
late 1997, which saw the nation's per capita income down to 9,000
U.S. dollars from the previous year's 10,548 U.S. dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Six days after the
resignation of Thai Public Health Minister Rakkiat Sukthana, his
deputy Thirawat Siriwansan was also forced to step down Monday
over the corruption scandal, television station Channel 9 said.
</P>
<P>
Rakkiat and Thirawat are the first two members of the current
cabinet who resigned. The two are believed to be involved in a
medical supplies purchasing scandal.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last month, some doctors in the provinces charged that
the Health Ministry has pressured hospitals to buy drugs and
medical supplies at inflated prices.
</P>
<P>
Once exposed, the scandal triggered great discontent among
public.
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, Rakkiat, deputy leader of Social Action Party,
had to resign under great pressure from both the public and other
parties of the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the resignation of the two ministers will lead to
an inevitable reshuffle of the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Channel 9 also reported that Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai,
leader of the Democrat Party, has begun negotiating with other
parties in the coalition about the reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Opinion poll showed that the approval rating of the coalition
government has fallen by 10 percentage points to 45.6 percent
because of the scandal.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Casinos Get Anti-Cash-Laundering Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Casinos will be
required from October 16 to keep records on people who spend or
win more than 10,000 Canadian dollars (6,600 U.S. dollars), the
Globe and Mail newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The requirement is one of several changes to regulations aimed
at preventing money laundering.
</P>
<P>
The government has spent more than a year drafting the changes,
which were released last week, as a way of tackling the growing
problem of money laundering.
</P>
<P>
The Solicitor-General's Office estimates that up to 17 billion
Canadian dollars (11.2 billion U.S. dollars) are laundered in
Canada every year.
</P>
<P>
Until now, only banks and some other financial institutions
have been required to keep records of large transactions in Canada.
</P>
<P>
The new rules will require casinos to keep the name, address,
phone number and occupation of anyone involved in a transaction
worth 10,000 Canadian dollars or more in one day.
</P>
<P>
If a casino extends credit to a customer beyond 2,500 Canadian
dollars (1,650 U.S. dollars), it must also record the same
personal information, the regulations say.
</P>
<P>
The records must be kept for five years.
</P>
<P>
Casinos are a big business in Canada, and they operate in
nearly every province.

<HEADLINE> AIDS to Shorten S. Africans' Life Expectancy: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Life expectancy in
South Africa is likely to fall from 60 years to 40 years by 2010
as a result of the AIDS epidemic, South African experts has
warned.
</P>
<P>
A group of experts who were commissioned by the Health
Department in the country to assess the effects of the disease
said during a two-day workshop last week that AIDS threatened to
undermine development gains achieved over decades.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the United Nations showed that South Africa has
the fastest growing AIDS epidemic in the world, local newspaper
Business Day reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The country also has the second largest number of HIV-positive
people in the world. About 1,500 South Africans are believed to
be infected each day.
</P>
<P>
This was due to factors such as the migrant labor system,
political violence and the easily transmitted virus strain
prevalent in the region, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The impact of the epidemic would be seen at family level in an
increase of orphans, and would affect welfare, health-care and
general economic development.
</P>
<P>
One of the experts, Alan Whiteside, said about 250,000 South
African school pupils and between 30,000 and 40,000 teachers were
infected with HIV.
</P>
<P>
Whiteside, acting director of the HIV/AIDS Research Division
at the University of Natal, said government had not done enough
in the past, but is now playing a bigger role in monitoring the
progress of the disease.
</P>
<P>
The experts said Xdvention remains essential as the number of
people with AIDS is expected to climb over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Their report on the impact of AIDS in South Africa will be
released in six weeks.

<HEADLINE> HK Communities Urged to Join in Youth Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Commission on
Youth Monday called on the entire community including the
government, families, schools, employers, media, non-governmental
organizations and youth groups to join hands in nurturing and
developing young people.
</P>
<P>
During a press briefing to announce the findings and
recommendations of the Study on Civic Awareness and Moral Values
of Youth, Eric Li, chairman of the Commission on Youth, said that
youth development is the responsibility of the community as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
The commission began the study after it was asked by Chief
Executive Tung Chee Hwa of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) last October to do a study on how the young people
could play a more active role in building up the SAR and in
voluntary work.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the major findings of the study are that most
young people possess positive values which are recognized and
accepted by the community.
</P>
<P>
But there are noticeable perception and expectation gaps on the
part of adults regarding young people's civic awareness and value
system, Li said.
</P>
<P>
"Overall, we believe that our young people have the potential
to face the challenges of the new millennium and to take an active
part in building up the SAR," Li said.
</P>
<P>
On the recommendations of the study, Li said that a three-prong
approach was suggested to help young people realize their full
potential.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, the widely held positive values among the young people
should be reinforced and promoted, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, to meet the training needs of the young people,
structured leadership training programs should be devised on a
continuing basis, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Thirdly, we call for full community ownership of the
responsibility for nurturing and developing our young people, with
the government taking the lead," Li stressed.
</P>
<P>
The community should give more opportunities for young people
to develop their potential and widen their vista, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li said that voluntary service can help cultivate a caring
attitude and a sense of responsibility and exchange programs with
China's mainland and other countries can help them understand
their country better and widen their perspective, Li said.

<HEADLINE> Tung Calls for Unity in Overcoming Economic Difficulties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive Tung Chee
Hwa of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) said
Monday that the government, employers and employees must work
hand-in-hand to overcome the difficulties during this period of
economic adjustment.
</P>
<P>
Tung said this during meetings with labor representatives to
exchange views with them on the preparation for the Policy
Address, which he will deliver early next month.
</P>
<P>
In analyzing the present economic situation, Tung said: "All of
us know that the period of economic adjustment we are going
through is painful but necessary."
</P>
<P>
"The market adjustments will help enhance our competitiveness.
This is conducive to our economic recovery," he said
</P>
<P>
Tung emphasized that he hoped that in adjusting staff wages,
companies in the private sector would fully take into account the
difficulties their staff might be facing.
</P>
<P>
"The employers and employees are in the same boat and must help
each other to tide over this difficult period," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Tung expected that the economic downturn would not reverse in
the short term. He called on the community to face the reality,
take the situation as a whole into consideration and rationally
resolve labor problems.
</P>
<P>
All parties must consider first the interest of the community
as a whole before taking any action. They must make sure that
their action will not affect the daily living of the general
public and business operation in the SAR, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The government will continue its efforts to improve the
investment environment. We will encourage investments, which will
in turn create job opportunities," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that the Labor Department stood ready to provide
conciliation service to help settle labor disputes. "We hoped both
 employers and employees would seek a solution peacefully and
would not resort to drastic measures," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The government is very concerned about the labor dispute
involving Hongkong Telecom," Tung said. The dispute was caused by
the announcement last week by the management of the Hongkong
Telecom, the biggest telecommunications company in Hong Kong, to
cut the staff wages by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
"On this, the Labor Department has expressed deep concern to
the company's management and urged them to continue the dialogue
with staff to see whether there are other alternatives," Tung
said.
</P>
<P>
"We appeal to employees to remain calm and continue to discuss
with management on ways of resolving their differences," he said.
</P>
<P>
On civil service pay adjustments, Tung said: "As a responsible
employer, the government will not abruptly change the established
pay adjustment mechanism. We will also make sure that pay
adjustments for the civil service are justified and reasonable."

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Plug Loophole in Port Agents' Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Port Authority
(KPA) is to take action against unscrupulous freight forwarders
and "briefcase" agents who have been extracting fictitious port
fees from users, especially those from land-locked Uganda.
</P>
<P>
East African, a local weekly, reported Monday that the KPA is
preparing commercials with clear information on the Mombasa
port's full range of services and charges for broadcast on
Ugandan radio and television.
</P>
<P>
KPA's resident representative in Kampala Ismail Mboya was
quoted as saying that unscrupulous freight forwarders and
briefcase agents have long been exploiting Ugandan port users,
billing them for items which did not exist in KPA tariff
schedules.
</P>
<P>
Among items irregularly charged to Ugandan port users by such
agents is "miscellaneous main gate charges," said Mboya.
</P>
<P>
"There is no such item in our billing system, nor does any
other levying agency, such as the Kenya Revenue Authority," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the establishment of the KPA marketing office in
Kampala, there was a lot of misinformation about port charges and
services emanating mainly from freight forwarders taking
advantage of unsuspecting clients, he said.
</P>
<P>
Many Ugandan importers were unaware of an eight-day grace
period for cargo in KPA's bonded warehouses to allow for the
processing of documents.
</P>
<P>
"It is only after the expiry of this period that the port can
start levying demurrage charges," he said.
</P>
<P>
Many shippers, said Mboya, had been billed for late entries by
the agents and the use of bonded warehouses right from the moment
their cargo was discharged.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan cargo handled by the port of Mombasa in Kenya has
increased considerably in the past 10 years from about 200,000
tons in 1988 to 1.6 million tons handled in 1996.
</P>
<P>
This accounted for more than half of the total transit traffic
of 2.6 million tons that passed through the port the same year.

telecommunications, Lockheed Martin Corporation announced plans

XI'AN, September 21 (Xinhua) -- A ceremony was held today in
Xi'an, capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, to name the
Helen Snow School and mark the completion of a statue of the
well-known American journalist.
</P>
<P>
Today also marked the 91st birth anniversary of Snow, who
reported from China in the 1930s. The renowqed journalist
interviewed patriotic Chinese General Zhang Xueliang in 1936, and
was first foreign journalist to tell the outside world about

</P>
<P>
She also visited Yan'an, the central revolutionary base of
the CPC, in 1937, and interviewed Mao Zedong and various other
Communist Party leaders. Snow regarded Xi'an and Yan'an as her
second homes.
</P>
<P>
The Helen Snow School, founded by two local enterprises and the
 government education department, includes kindergarten, primary,
junior and senior middle school departments.
</P>
<P>
The facility covers 16,650 sq.m. and is equipped with modern
instruction equipments. An U.S. volunteer organization will
supply four American teachers on regular basis.

ISLAMABAD, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Two rockets hit the Afghan

another 215 wounded in heavy rocket attacks on residential areas
in Kabul Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from Kabul Monday afternoon said that at
least 10 civilians were killed and another 10 wounded in the first

<HEADLINE> S. African Squad Begins Arms Blitz in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 21 (Xinhua) -- A crack South African
police unit has entered Mozambique on a three-week arms
destruction mission, the biggest cross-border operation of its
kind ever, The Star newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The squad, consisting of 33 special task force, bomb disposal
and firearm experts headed by a police director, crossed the
border early Sunday and will be assisted by 12 of their
Mozambican colleagues, said the local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The operation, code-named Rachel IV, follows three previous
raids on arms caches in the neighboring state in which more than
300 tons of firearms and 40 million rounds of ammunition were
blown to shrapnel with powerful explosives.
</P>
<P>
The Rachel operations were originally decided upon to stop the
flow of illegal firearms into South Africa before they cross the
border, and to safeguard people living in rural and remote areas
of Mozambique where most of the weapons are stashed.
</P>
<P>
Since Mozambican authorities have neither the financial means
nor the expertise to destroy the caches, the South African police
supplied explosives, landmine-resistant vehicles and other
specialized equipment as well as highly trained senior policemen
to fulfill the missions.
</P>
<P>
South African Police Service (SAPS) assistant commissioner
Suiker Britz, who is in command of the joint South
African-Mozambican operations, said a substantial number of arms
caches had been identified and plotted on maps.
</P>
<P>
He said although only about 60 of the hidden venues would be
excavated and destroyed in the 20 days that the Rachel IV
operation would last, the hardware expected to be destroyed would
be more than the three previous ventures combined.
</P>
<P>
Most of the hidden hardware originated from eastern European
countries and some of it was left over from the Mozambican civil
war, the Star report said.
</P>
<P>
Police said the entire haul was still potent and suitable for
the underground market.
</P>
<P>
Britz said the Rachel ventures were crippling illegal
gun-running operations into South Africa and were dealing blows
to unscrupulous smuggling syndicates.

<HEADLINE> South Korea to Cut Defense Budget for 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 21 (Xinhua) -- South Korean Defense Ministry
Monday presented a defense budget draft of 13.75 trillion won (990
million U.S. dollars) for fiscal 1999 to the National Assembly, or
parliament, for consideration.
</P>
<P>
Under the draft budget, the ministry called for a total of
13.75 trillion won for next year, a 50 billion won (36 million
U.S. dollars) less than this year's 13.8 trillion won (993.6
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The proposed budget is divided into 4.14 trillion won (298
million U.S. dollars) of defense improvement costs and 9.6
trillion won (690 million U.S. dollars) of operation and
maintenance expenditures.
</P>
<P>
If the budget plan is approved by the parliament, it will mark
the first decrease of the nation's defense budget since the
foundation of the military 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The country's defense budget has steadily grown by 9.3-12.6
percent in the past years.
</P>
<P>
The budget plan came when the nation is suffering deteriorating
economy, which was spurred by a financial crisis caused by
corporate bankruptcies and bad loans of financial institutions
late last year.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho on Brink of Anarchy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho stood on the
brink of anarchy Sunday night as the opposition alliance called a
stayaway from Monday which would last "until the government is in
the hands of the people", South African media reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
A spokesperson for the opposition, Sekwalo Tolwane, said they
were no longer interested in talking to the ruling Lesotho
Congress for Democracy (LCD) after the absence of the LCD from a
series of meetings Sunday brokered by South Africa, Botswana and
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The LCD refused to talk directly to the alliance, and South
African Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi's shuttle
diplomacy failed to produce any results. Opposition leaders
waited for more than two hours as Mufamadi tried to convince the
ruling party to come to the talks.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of opposition supporters who had gathered in Maseru
for a report-back were disillusioned and angry after it was
reported that the ruling party was not interested in meeting
their leaders.
</P>
<P>
The meetings were proposed after the release of a report by a
three-nation commission to look into opposition allegations that
the May 23 general elections in the mountain kingdom were rigged
in favor of the LCD.
</P>
<P>
The report said there were irregularities in the elections,
but failed to say for sure that they were rigged.
</P>
<P>
After the release of the report, the government led by
Pakalitha Mosisili refused to step down.
</P>
<P>
The capital Maseru was teeming with thousands of opposition
supporters demanding the resignation of the government.
</P>
<P>
Senior LCD members were afraid to venture into the capital,
which has become a no-go zone for them because of the six-week
protest outside King Letsie III's palace.
</P>
<P>
Twenty senior military officers have fled to Ladybrand in
South Africa's Free State where they have been sheltered since
last week.
</P>
<P>
The sound of gunfire has been heard over the past few nights,
and drunken armed soldiers have often harassed motorists.
</P>
<P>
Civil servants have been barred from entering their offices
and government members are unable to use the parliamentary
buildings from which they have been barred by protesters.

<HEADLINE> Graduates Unemployment in Jordan Forces Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 21 (Xinhua) -- A high unemployment rate of
Jordan's college graduates has awakened officials to urging the
government to forge an equation between the graduates supply and
market demands, the Jordan Times daily reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Some 16 percent of Jordan's college graduates have no jobs
while 50 percent of the unemployed are the graduates, Tayseer
Nahar, an official National Center for Human Resources
Development, was quoted by the paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment problem is still worsening as the number of
college students rises by an annual 9.2 percent on average, Nahar
told a national conference on unemployment Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Nahar called on the government to find a way to solve the
problem of oversupply of the highly-educated manpower.
</P>
<P>
He proposed the government improve vocational training, adjust
high school curricula to enable students to adapt to market
requirements and develop a comprehensive policy aimed at improving
the quality of education.
</P>
<P>
The government may set up a better information system to help
advance education and employment policies, and encourage higher
education institutes and the production sectors to jointly run the
education process, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has 55 community colleges, six public and six private
universities. The annual number of the graduates far exceeds that
of the job opportunities, which is estimated at 15,000, the
kingdom creates each year.
</P>
<P>
Official figures say that Jordan's unemployment rate stands at
15 percent while independent statistics say the figure is 27
percent.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Giving Priority to Securing Adequate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian ministers Monday
said that the top priority of the government is securing adequate
staple commodity stocks for the country's needy people, according
to Antara News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"Our greatest concern now is how this country can be rescued
from its present crisis," National Development Planning Minister
Boediono said in Yogyakarta, Central Java.
</P>
<P>
In an extra-curricular lecture to state-run Gadjah Mada
University students, Boediono said the development strategy the
government had been implementing so far was focused on meeting the
people's need for affordable essential goods.
</P>
<P>
The government was also continuing to do its best to stabilize
the soaring prices of staple commodities in markets around the
archipelago to enable people at the lowest level of society to buy
them.
</P>
<P>
"One of the ways the government is pursuing to stabilize
fluctuating market prices is providing subsidies," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that 17 million families in the country are
facing food shortages now. In Central and East Java provinces, 60
percent of 7.3 million poor families (averaging four people to a
household) could afford only one meal a day.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Minister for Cooperative and Small/Medium
Enterprises Adi Sasono told a meeting in South Sulawesi province's
capital of Ujung Pandang that Indonesia would hopefully be able to
get out of its crisis within the next three months.
</P>
<P>
Sasono said he hoped stability of prices of daily necessaries
could be reached by the end of this year if the government gave
priority to the stabilization of the prices of daily necessities
and the provision of adequate stocks.
</P>
<P>
Since the country was hit by the economic crisis, the number of
families living under poverty line is reported to have increased
from 22 million to 79 million people.

<HEADLINE> China Building Forest In Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- China has added more than 1.5
million trees to 3,300 hectares of barren land in 38 Tibetan
counties since 1995.
</P>
<P>
Forests in the Tibet Autonomous Region now contain fruit trees
and trees producing edible oils, beverages, essences and raw
industrial and medicinal materials.
</P>
<P>
The trees have helped economic development in the autonomous
region, and fruit trees, the Chinese prickly ash, and tung oil
trees have become a major source of income.
</P>
<P>
Zogang County in the eastern part of Tibet has put 120,000 yuan
(about 14,000 U.S. dollars) into the business over the past three
years. Some farmers have planted their own orchards. Each
household can earn 4,000 to 6,000 yuan annually by selling fruit.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Tibet Forestry Administration show that the
economic trees in Tibet produced an output value of more than 50
million yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
Officials say that the trees also add beauty to the landscape
of Tibet, and have provided a protective screen for villages and
farmland.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Congratulates Israelis on Jewish New Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority President Yasser Arafat has phoned Israeli leaders and
prominent political figures to congratulate them on the Jewish New
Year, Israel Radio reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
During the telephone conversation with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu on Rosh Hashana, the two-day holiday beginning
at sundown Sunday, Arafat wished him a happy new year, the radio
said.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the Israeli Prime Minister's Office said the two
leaders also discussed the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations over
the Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and agreed to complete
them through American mediation.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Netanyahu have agreed during the visit of U.S. peace
envoy Dennis Ross to the region earlier this month to hold direct
talks. The two will be in New York later this week to attend the
General Assembly of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian News Agency Wafa reported that Arafat also
extended New Year greetings to Israeli President Ezer Weizman,
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, Labor Party leader Ehud Barak,
former Prime Minister Shimon Peres and Leah Rabin, widow of slain
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
To each of them, Arafat said in Hebrew "Shana Tova," or "Happy
New Year," the agency reported.

<HEADLINE> China's Cinemas Get Support From Blockbusters (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- While American blockbusters
are attracting most Chinese moviegoers, cinemas nationwide are
trying to improve their sound equipment to cater to an
increasingly fastidious audience.
</P>
<P>
Several years of production and publishing reforms have made
money-earners out of Chinese cinemas, but industry insiders are
warning of problems if extensive changes don't take place.
</P>
<P>
"We should make money from the industry instead of squandering
investment on film-making," says Chen Shuping, deputy general
manager of the Dizhi (geology) Auditorium, one of Beijing's most
luxurious and profitable cinemas.
</P>
<P>
For the past four decades, China's film-makers, publishers, and
cinemas have kept in line with the planned economy, and
film-makers, who followed official requests, took little notice of
financial returns for their dull products.
</P>
<P>
Box office receipts fell 470 million yuan (about 57 million
U.S. dollars) in 1992, and there were 3.84 billion fewer viewers
than in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Six of the 16 film studios in China were running in the red at
the time.

<TEXT>
<P>
When the government decided to introduce foreign blockbusters
to stimulate the domestic market in 1995, cinemas earned 740,000
yuan from the American True Lies in just 7 days. They also set a
daily box-office record of 120,000 yuan, with more than 5,000
movie-goers each day.
</P>
<P>
Revenues from the entertainment industry account for a major
part of state revenues, says Huang Huilin, a film theory professor
at Beijing Teachers' University.
</P>
<P>
Although 70 percent of the domestic films are entertaining,
they can hardly compete with foreign exports in earnings. Every
year, China produces some "major theme" films on historic events
and great people, and government and factory employees make up
most of the audience.
</P>
<P>
Cinemas need to provide up-to-date audio and video equipment,
according to Huang Shixian, a movie critic, who says that most of
the Chinese cinemas hardly compare with those in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Using box office earnings for technological improvements is
naturally suited to the market economy, Chen says.
</P>
<P>
Exciting films like Titanic and Deep Impact, which are being
shown in Beijing now, bring huge returns to those advanced
cinemas, and many viewers say that they go to excite their senses.

BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Chunyun, vice chairman
of the Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's
Congress, met today with a delegation from the Korean Foundation,
headed by foundation president Lee Joung-Binn.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is passing through Beijing on their way to
Shanghai to attend the fifth annual meeting of the Sino-ROK Forum
for the Future, jointly sponsored by the foundation and the
Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The forum was initiated in 1994 by individuals from political,
economic and cultural sectors in both countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that China and the ROK established diplomatic ties
six years ago, and noted that cooperation in many sectors,
including the political, economic and cultural arenas, has
developed considerably. He also cited that agreement has been
reached on issues of the Korean Peninsula. The two sides had good
cooperation during the four-party talks and have become important
trade partners.
</P>
<P>
He said China attaches great importance to relations with the
ROK and is awaiting President Kim Dae-Jung's visit in November.
</P>

Jiang briefed the delegation on China's extensive summer battle

country will be able to recoup substantial losses and achieve the
planned economic growth target.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Brewers Eyeing U.S. Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese beer is expected to
begin competing more in the United States, the largest beer market
in the world, according to Asian Strategic Investments
Corp. (ASIMCO).
</P>
<P>
The company announced today that its joint venture in Beijing,
the Five Star Beer Co. Ltd., will begin shipping to the
U.S. tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Five Star will be the second Chinese beer with large-scale
sales overseas, after Qingdao Beer, which began shipments abroad
two decades ago. It now has annual exports to the U.S. of 800,000
standard cases.
</P>
<P>
According to Jack Perkowski, chairman and CEO of ASIMCO, the
first four containers, or 5,000 cases of Five Star Beer, will
leave Tianjin port in north China on Tuesday. Each case
contains four six-packs.
</P>
<P>
Starting in October, 40 containers will be shipped to the
U.S. monthly, he said.
</P>
<P>
Five Star has been exported to China's neighbors, says Chang
Huaizhi, technical director of the joint venture, who explains
that they can now export to the U.S. on a large scale because Five
Star's quality is consistent and it has access to a national
network of 600 distributors.
</P>
<P>
Chinese analysts say Five Star has a light, smooth, and
non-bitter taste that may be easily accepted by U.S. beer
drinkers. The packaging points to its Chinese character and
attempts to attract American consumers, who are known for their
willingness to try beer from different parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
Annual beer consumption in the U.S. is 20 million tons, and in
spite of a flat market last year, imports grew 14.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Five Star hopes to become one of the top 25 imported brands in
the U.S. in the future, Perkowski said. It will be positioned as a
premium beer in the U.S., the same as Qingdao, he says, and it
will be available not only in Chinese restaurants and Chinatowns,
but in grocery stores and supermarkets in the fifty states.

CANBERRA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Australian sharemarket
closed lower Monday after succumbing to the negative sentiment
which sent Asian markets on a downward tumble, brokers said.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark all ordinaries index dropped 18 points to finish
the day at 2521.9, after recovering from a low of 2513.1 earlier

<P>
"It looks like there's some uncertainty about what the Japanese
government is doing about bailing out the banking system," said
Pembroke Josephson Wright client adviser Steven Carroll.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said the light volume traded on the Australian bourse
was due to concern over the plight of international markets and
investors sitting on the sidelines ahead of the federal election
next month.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was 202.12 million shares traded for 682.75
million Australian dollars (402.82 million U.S. dollars), with

<HEADLINE> Internet Awareness and Use Grow in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The rise in Internet
awareness in Kenya has triggered a spiral growth in on-line
trading as at least 25,000 people in the country have Internet
access.
</P>
<P>
The vast potential of on-line trading was apparent at a recent
Internet auction of seats to various European destinations by
Lufthansa Airlines. Kenyans were among 600 potential buyers who
bid through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The rise in Internet awareness and use was first noted during
the 1997 general election in the east African country and is
largely credited to the Nation Media Group website, which had an
average of 50,000 hits a day.
</P>
<P>
During the December election month, Internet services reported
eight million visits to Kenyan sites, Barney Lodge, chief of
Media Street, an electronic advertising agency in Nairobi, was
quoted by Monday's East African as saying.
</P>
<P>
In Kenya, "at least 25,000 people have Internet access and the
number is bound to grow as the cost of connections and computers
falls and back-up services improve," said Lodge.
</P>
<P>
Until two years ago, computers cost not less than 100,000
Shillings (1,666 U.S. Dollars) but prices now average 60,000
Shillings (1,000 Dollars), largely due to a reduct o,HZ7 import
duty and competition among a large number of importers.
</P>
<P>
The growth in the number of Internet users has, however, been
hampered by poor telephone connections, with most business
clients reluctant to invest in developing their own websites,
fearing that these would not be easily accessible.
</P>
<P>
In response, the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications
Corporation is planning to install a fiber optic telephone
network by November, which will provide "clean" and fast Internet
connections.
</P>
<P>
However, Victor Mabachi, chairman of the Advertising
Practitioners Associations (APA), said the Internet still lacks a
solid client base to attract good advertising.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the bulk of advertising on the Internet is by
small-scale traders, who constitute 75 percent of all
advertisers, said Geoffrey Shimanyula, the marketing manager of
AfricaOnline, which is Kenya's biggest Internet service provider.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Inflation Dives to Record Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Consumer price inflation in
Hong Kong fell to a 17-year low of 2.7 percent in August, the
latest government statistics show.
</P>
<P>
The August Composite Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 2.7
percent on a year-on-year base, lower than that of 3.2 percent in
July, the Census and Statistics Department said Monday.
</P>
<P>
It is the lowest inflation rate ever recorded since October of
1981, when the year-on-year rate of increase in the Composite CPI
was first computed.
</P>
<P>
A substantial decrease in food prices was responsible for the
low inflation rate in August, when prices of food declined by 3.5
percent against a high base of comparison a year earlier. Private
housing rentals and prices of miscellaneous goods continued to
ease during the month.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said Monday that the continued
moderation in consumer price inflation to a record low of 2.7
percent in August was a reflection of the adjustment process that
has been going on expeditiously in the economy against the impact
of the Asian financial turmoil.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines Readies Sale of Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Airlines (PAL)
submitted Monday to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) a
"liquidation plan," outlining the mechanics of its closure within
a two-month period.
</P>
<P>
Jaime Bautista, PAL senior vice president for finance, told
reporters that the management began formulating a two-month
liquidation plan last week.
</P>
<P>
He said the priority of the plan would be the return of some 25
aircraft under mortgage.
</P>
<P>
Although PAL announced last week it will end its flight
operations after midnight on Wednesday, it has yet to withdraw its
debt relief petition. Thus, it has to meet the SEC-set deadline of
Monday to submit its liquidation plan.
</P>
<P>
Monday's hearing was set as a venue of PAL's interim
rehabilitation receiver to submit to the rehabilitation plan. The
hearing was set long before PAL announced its closure.
</P>
<P>
Under SEC rules, PAL is required to withdraw its debt relief
petition and file a motion for liquidation or dissolution if that
is what it plans to do.
</P>
<P>
If PAL wants a voluntary dissolution, it will have to seek the
approval of the majority of its board as well as its stockholders,
representing two-thirds of the company's authorized capital stock.
</P>
<P>
A motion filed by PAL this June with the SEC for the suspension
of its debt payment also stands in the way of any foreclosure.
</P>
<P>
PAL owes foreign and local creditors at least 2.1 billion U.S.
dollars. The biggest foreign creditor is Chase Manhattan Bank
which syndicated the loan for the early phase of PAL's refleeting
program.
</P>
<P>
Chase's local exposure to PAL is about 230 million dollars, of
which about 180 million dollars is thought to be unsecured.
</P>
<P>
PAL's biggest local creditor is the Philippine National Bank, a
minority shareholder of PAL, with an exposure of 75 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Aside from owing local and foreign banks, PAL owes money to
many of its trade suppliers as well as oil companies, hotel
operators and others.
</P>
<P>
Before its retrenchment in June this year, the airline had a
fleet of 54 aircraft, flying to 36 domestic destinations and 28
foreign cities.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Weakens by Asian Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
weaker Monday, as concerns over Asia continued to have an impact.
</P>
<P>
The local unit ended at 58.67 U.S. cents, down from 59.12 last
week.
</P>
<P>
Portfolio manager at Perpetual Funds Management Glen Thomas
said sentiment on the local currency was not particularly positive
given the current crisis in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Despite coming up with a basic agreement to resolve the banking
crisis, problems for the Japanese government continued.
</P>
<P>
Market speculation was strong that the agreement would collapse
following remarks from Japanese politicians on both sides of
government about the effectiveness of it.
</P>
<P>
"That's weighing on the yen and in turn the Aussie," he said.
</P>
<P>
The federal election was slowly capturing the attention of the
market, Thomas noted.
</P>
<P>
The proximity of the Labor Party to the ruling coalition in
recent polls had made the contest more interesting.
</P>
<P>
Considerable volatility in the Australian dollar was expected
to persist through to year end, Colonial State Bank chief
economist Craig James said in a quarterly economic report.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the possibility for different influences to exert
dominance, the Australian dollar is still likely to face upside
resistance," he said.
</P>
<P>
James said it was likely there would be an easing in U.S.
monetary policy which would further weaken support for the U.S.
currency.
</P>
<P>
He said upside for the Australian dollar would depend on the
restoration of confidence in global financial markets.
</P>
<P>
The local currency was trading at 78.10 Japanese yen from 78.08
and 0.9880 German marks from 1.0002.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Postpones Tour Program to DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The program of taking South
Koreans to tour Mountain Kumgang in the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK), originally scheduled to start this
Friday, has been postponed.
</P>
<P>
Upon returning here Monday from a visit to the DPRK, Chung
Mong-hun, chairman of the Hyundai Group, said the launch of a
Hyundai cruise ship to the DPRK was delayed as a final agreement
was not reached on the details of the tourism project, including
investment matters.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, the maiden voyage of the cruise ship is likely to
be made mid-October at the earliest," said Chung.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK's Asia-Pacific Peace Committee, in charge of the
tourism project, is still engaged in negotiations with other DPRK
authorities on the details of the project and the delay does not
have connection with the matter on tour expenses or political
problems, he added.
</P>
<P>
Due to the delay, Hyundai will also postpone sending workers
and construction material to the DPRK for the construction of pier
facilities in Changjon Port, the gateway to Mountain Kumgang.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai signed an agreement with the DPRK's Asia-Pacific Peace
Committee in June this year to develop tourism resources of
Mountain Kumgang by bringing 1,000 South Koreans every day for
sightseeing in the mountain area beginning from September 25 this
year.

<HEADLINE> Harmful Chemical Found in River Yamuna of India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Scientists from Jawaharlal
Nehru University have found polychlorinated benzene (PCB), a well
known cancer causing agent, in River Yamuna which is the main
source of drinking water in capital New Delhi, Press Trust of
India (PTI) said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The threat is maximum near the Nazafgarh area of west Delhi
where PCB concentration rises as high as 782 parts per billion
(PPB) during monsoon season, PTI quoted A. K. Bhattacharyya, a
professor at the school of environmental science in the university
as saying.
</P>
<P>
PCB has also been found in the portion of Yamuna adjacent to
Okhla industrial area in southeast Delhi, Nizamuddin area of south
Delhi and Wazirabad area of north Delhi.
</P>
<P>
The sources of PCB may be the batteries and electrical
components like capacitors and transformers as well as plastic
bags and containers which are being used excessively in most of
the small scale industries, professor Bhattacharyya said.
</P>
<P>
The maximum permissible limit of PCB in water, as fixed by the
U.S. Federal Department of Agriculture, is 600 PPB, PTI said.

<HEADLINE> Typhoons Leave 27 Dead in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- At least 27 people were killed
in the northern Philippines due to floods brought about by two
successive typhoons that hit the country over the weekend, the
National Disaster Coordinating Council (NDCC) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Floodwaters also forced the government to evacuate 13,446
families or 70,512 people in the northern island of Luzon,
including those in Metro Manila, when typhoon Emang and tropical
storm Gading blasted the country, the NDCC said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The death toll of 27 did not include the 42 fatalities in the
sinking of a passenger ship last Friday night at the mouth of
Manila Bay.
</P>
<P>
Navy and Coast Guard ships are still combing the mouth of
Manila Bay for possible survivors, although hopes are fading fast
for any of the missing to survive after three days at sea without
food and drinking water.
</P>
<P>
Frogmen Monday retrieved three more bodies swept to the
shorelines of Cavite, bringing to 54 the death toll in the sea
tragedy. A total of 357 survivors have been rescued and 43 people
are still missing.
</P>
<P>
In the northern province of Pangasinan, floods continued to
rise after excess water from Biga Dam was released on a calibrated
basis.
</P>
<P>
Several towns are in danger of being isolated by the rampaging
floodwaters in the province, the hardest-stricken by the two
typhoons, NDCC said.
</P>
<P>
Several roads and bridges in northern Luzon were also flooded
at the height of the rain. Some areas in Metro Manila were not
spared.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada has declared a state of calamity in
Pangasinan and its neighboring province Pampanga. A total of 9.5
million pesos (220,930 U.S. dollars) were allocated by Estrada for
disaster-relief and rehabilitation efforts in Pampanga.

<HEADLINE> Employees Vote on Fate of Philippine Airlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
Monday conducted a nationwide referendum among members of the
Philippine Airlines Employees Association (PALEA) to decide the
fate of the debt-ridden airlines.
</P>
<P>
Labor Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma said a committee has been
formed to directly supervise the referendum, widely seen as the
last-ditch effort to save the moribund Philippine Airlines (PAL).
</P>
<P>
Laguesma said he is still hopeful that the PAL management and
its union leaders would arrive at an acceptable solution to their
dispute.
</P>
<P>
PAL announced last Friday that it will shut down Wednesday
since its rebuilding efforts were no longer viable following the
union's refusal to accept a management proposed rescue plan.
</P>
<P>
Labor officials said the referendum will allow PALEA members to
vote on whether or not the workers should agree to a
management-proposed rescue plan.
</P>
<P>
Under the management proposal, PALEA members would receive a
20- percent share in the company in exchange for a 10-year
suspension of their collective bargaining agreement (CBA), as well
as three seats in the 15-member board. Each worker would get some
60,000 shares of stock worth 300,000 pesos (6,976 U.S. dollars at
current rate).

<HEADLINE> 54 Dead, 43 Still Missing in Philippine Ship Sinking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Navy and Coast
Guard rescue vessels on Monday intensified their search in the
Manila Bay area for 43 people still missing in last Friday's
sinking of an inter-island ship carrying 454 people.
</P>
<P>
A coast guard ship went to the area at 5 a.m. Monday to resume
its search and rescue operation for the missing passengers in the
sinking of M/V Princess of the Orient.
</P>
<P>
Three more dead bodies were recovered by frogmen Monday along
the shorelines of Cavite province near Manila, bringing to 54 the
death toll from the sea disaster.
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard listed 357 rescued, leaving 43 still missing in
the worst sea tragedy since 1994 when an inter-island ship sank
near the central Philippines, killing 113 people.
</P>
<P>
The Board of Marine Inquiry will immediately start the
investigation as soon as the rescue operation is completed.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers said hopes to find more survivors grow dimmer,
considering that the ship sank three days ago.
</P>
<P>
However, Navy and Coast Guard ships continue their search
between the waters of the provinces of Cavite and Batangas.
</P>
<P>
All the 357 rescued and the 54 fatalities were found drifting
at sea near Fortune Island, where the ship sank on its way from
Manila toward southern Cebu city Friday night, or along the
shorelines of Cavite.
</P>
<P>
Frogmen from the Navy and Coast Guard have been deployed to
retrieve bodies that have been drifted ashore.
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated ship went down 360 fathoms deep at the height of
typhoon Gading which hit the country last week.
</P>
<P>
The 13,734-ton Princess of the Orient is the largest
inter-island ship in the country before it capsized.
</P>
<P>
Captain Isrom Mahilum, the ship's skipper, was reported to be
alive but this could not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
The investigation on why the ship sank despite its huge size
will be the focus of a marine board inquiry.
</P>
<P>
Based on the passenger manifest, there were only 454 people,
including 102 crew members on board when the ship sank at the
mouth of the Manila Bay. The vessel was authorized to carry more
than 3,000 passengers.
</P>
<P>
There are reports that the ship was carrying huge cargoes that
included 15 vehicles and 66 containers. Investigators are expected
to look into this angle whether there was any overloading of
cargoes.
</P>
<P>
Survivors recounted that the sinking happened so fast
considering that the ship did not sustain any damage despite being
battered by big waves.

<HEADLINE> Traditional Chinese Medicines for U.S. Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- China is promoting
traditional Chinese medicine for Western markets with the help of
a well-known international pharmaceutical company.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.'s Covance Inc. is testing two Chinese medicines for
cardiovascular disease and will submit them for approval by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
China has over 20,000 types of medicinal herbs and produces
500,000 types of Chinese medicines, but only a small portion of
them are exported. Most medicines that China exports are in the
form of raw materials and Chinese medicines now appear in the
U.S. as food items.
</P>
<P>
Covance has signed an agreement with the China Innovation
Center for Life Sciences (CICLS), a Chinese medicine promotion
institute of the Ministry of Science and Technology to introduce
traditional Chinese medicine to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Covance Chairman and CEO Chris Kuebler says that Covance will
become a bridge between the traditional Eastern approach to
medicine and the rigorous standards of Western drug development.
</P>
<P>
Ma Yonghua, a CICLS official, says that because of various
differences, it will take a lot of hard work and three to five
years before westerners understand the benefits of the Chinese
medicine.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Police Detain 40 in City Disturbances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 21 (Xinhua) -- About 40 men have been
detained following disturbances here Sunday night and Monday
involving supporters of former Malaysian deputy prime minister
Anwar Ibrahim, police said Monday.
</P>
<P>
About 30 of them were detained Monday morning for illegal
assembly at the courthouse area here and defying police warnings
to disperse from there while Sunday night 10 people were detained
for a similar offense near the prime minister's official residence
here, Deputy Director of Internal Security and Public Order Yusof
Said said.
</P>
<P>
Disturbances also occurred Sunday at the Putra World Trade
Center where the headquarters of the ruling United Malays National
Organization (UMNO) of which sacked Anwar was deputy president is
located.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who was sacked as deputy prime minister and finance
minister on September 2 and expelled from the UMNO on day later
for alleged "low morals", has been detained under the Internal
Security Act (ISA) following Sunday night's disturbances arising
from pro-Anwar rallies.
</P>
<P>
Yusof said Anwar's supporters had assembled illegally and
vandalized public property, including portraits of UMNO leaders at
the Putra World Trade Center, describing Anwar's supporters as
having gone over the limits Sunday night to the extent of
threatening public order.
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday was too much, They have become a nuisance causing
damage to property, so the IGP (Inspector-General of Police) said
that's it. Enough is enough," Yusof said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the police would take stern action again
rumor-mongers who could aggravate the situation.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Moves to Achieve APEC Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Representatives from the Thai ministries of commerce, industry,
finance and foreign affairs will meet at the end of this month to
discuss issues of products, time frame and final tariff rates in
liberalizing the trade with 17 other APEC member economies.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's revision plan follows a recent meeting of APEC
senior officials in Kuantan, Malaysia, which failed to break the
deadlock in the realization of the Early Voluntary Sectoral
Liberalization plan that APEC leaders agreed to adopt last year.
</P>
<P>
The plan requires members to open up trade in nine priority
areas with the target of eliminating tariffs by 2005. They are
chemical, energy, environmental goods and services, fish and
fisheries, forestry, gems and jewelry, medical equipment, toys and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Thailand confirmed its intention to participate in all sectors
but wants to reserve tariff rates of between zero and 5 percent
for a number of sensitive products in each sector.
</P>
<P>
With this plan, Thailand will only meet the APEC requirement
in the gems and jewelry sector, which will be traded at the final
tariff rate of zero to 5 percent in 2005. Trade in other sectors
will be freed up between 2005 and 2019, according to the
officials.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's reluctance to conform with the APEC end-date and
end-rate in other sectors drew criticism at the APEC meeting in
Kuantan, Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
To bridge the gap with APEC's plan, Thailand could begin
reducing tariffs from 2003 or 2004, an official said on condition
of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Thailand said earlier that it has set 2005 as the starting
point for reducing tariffs because it wants the nine-member
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to enjoy similar
privileges under the grouping's free trade area which is due to
begin operation in 2003.
</P>
<P>
It also wants maximum flexibility in terms of the APEC time
frame, which allows developing countries to liberalize trade by
2020 to boost revenue from collecting import tax. Developed
countries are set to free up trade by 2010.
</P>
<P>
APEC members have to submit their revised plan by the end of
October to Malaysia which is hosting the APEC leaders meeting in
mid-November.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Drop to New 12-Year Low in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices plunged in Tokyo
Monday with the Nikkei index dropping to a new 12-year low after
last Friday's political compromise on restructuring the banking
system showed signs of breakdown.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange sank 385.82 points, or 2.76
percent, from Friday's close to end at 13,597.30, falling below
the previous 12-and-a-half-year closing low of 13,859.14 set
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It was the Nikkei's lowest close since February 28, 1986 when
it ended at 13,640.83 at the beginning of Japan's asset-inflated
bubble economy.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, lost 25.43 points or 2.37 percent to
1,047.79.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section decreased to an estimated 389
million shares from Friday's 453.90 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan (LTCB) was the day's most
heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
The steep decline was partly due to selling by domestic
corporations to secure profits before they close their books for
the April-September period, traders said.
</P>
<P>
But traders were most disappointed by the diverging opinions
among political leaders which emerged over the weekend on how to
handle the struggling LTCB.
</P>
<P>
While opposition party leaders are against using public fund to
boost LTCB's capital base, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka,
the top government spokesman, indicated Monday that this may
happen.
</P>
<P>
The confusion sent bank shares falling hard, with the sector
losing 3.44 percent.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,341 issues listed on the First Section, losers
outnumbered gainers 956 to 217, with 114 issues ending unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Tackling Delay of New Airport Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Thai authorities are
seeking ways to deal with a delay in the design of a new airport
scheduled to be operational in 2004, airport sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned New Bangkok International Airport Company,
which runs the Nong Ngu Hao Airport project, has run into trouble
with its cooperators, thus resulting in the delay.
</P>
<P>
The airport company has hired Murphy Jahn/Tams/Act Co. to
design the airport's passenger terminal, but Murphy Jahn/Tams/Act
Co. faces a problem of cooperation with the airport project's
consulting firm -- the General Engineering Consultant Co.
</P>
<P>
Due to the delay, Murphy Jahn/Tams/Act Co. cannot seek payments
from the airport company so it has to shoulder more costs, said
the sources.
</P>
<P>
Despite 30-percent completion of extensive and costly site
preparations, the airport might not be completed as scheduled, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Initiated in 1960, the airport had been "on and off" the agenda
under the successive governments.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, Chuan Leekpai's first administration made a determined
bid to go ahead with the project, but only to see his successor
Chavalit Yongchaiyudh move the location from Nong Ngu Hao to
Nakhon Pathom or Nakhon Nayok on the suburbs of Bangkok. Since the
new location drew criticism, the Chavalit government agreed to
keep Nong Ngu Hao, east of Bangkok, as the site.
</P>
<P>
When Chuan Leekpai regained power last November, his government
restored the Nong Ngu Hao project in full.
</P>
<P>
"At this stage, the project has gone far beyond the stage where
suspension or relocation can be considered. The government has
already invested more than 2.5 billion baht (625 million U.S.
dollars) in Nong Ngu Hao. We cannot abandon it and restart
elsewhere," said Pradit Phatraprasit, deputy transport and
communications minister, who supervises the project.
</P>
<P>
He said work might be completed slightly behind schedule
because the economic crisis has trimmed state spending.
</P>
<P>
The solution to finding finance for airport work would be to
privatize international airports nationwide, he said.
</P>
<P>
Four companies would be established to operate the country's
international airports as part of a government plan to speed up
the privatization process as well as construction of the new
airport to meet the 2004 deadline, Pradit said.
</P>
<P>
This needed a strong management team for the project, he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Japan to Conduct Joint Research on Missile System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Japan
on Sunday agreed to conduct joint research on a missile defense
system.
</P>
<P>
This was announced at a joint press conference held in New York
by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Defense Secretary
William Cohen, their Japanese counterparts Masahiko Komura and
Fukushiro Nukaga.
</P>
<P>
"No one should doubt our commitment to defend our interests and
to work together for peace and stability in Asia," said Cohen,
adding that the joint research "is the best way to protect both
the United States and Japan."
</P>
<P>
Japan and the United States "will spare no efforts" to improve
defense and security in the region, said Japanese Foreign Minister
Masahiko Komura.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Japan announced security alliance
guidelines last year.
</P>
<P>
In a joint U.S.-Japan statement on Sunday, the two governments
renewed their commitments to the 1994 agreed framework with the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to freeze the
latter's nuclear program in exchange for the construction of
light-water reactors to meet its energy needs.
</P>
<P>
Komura said Japan, a party to the Korean Peninsula Energy
Development Organization agreement, still supports the program,
but at the moment it "cannot go ahead with the smooth contribution
of 1 billion U.S. dollars" due to the DPRK's "recent missile test".
</P>
<P>
The whole scheme costs about 4.6 billion dollars with the
United States and South Korea as two other major contributors.
</P>
<P>
In their statement, the United States and Japan also urged the
DPRK not to develop, test, launch or deploy missiles.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also talked about economic matters. Albright said
Japan took an important step in approving a plan to reform its
debt-ridden banks. "What will be important is how it is
implemented," she added.
</P>
<P>
There are other aspects of an economic program that we would
like to see and President Bill Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi will be discussing that during their summit, Albright
said.
</P>
<P>
The summit is scheduled for Tarrytown, New York on Tuesday, a
day after the general debate of the 53rd session of the
U.N. General Assembly starts.
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrived in New York on Sunday and will address the
Assembly on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Trade Surplus Climbs 25 Percent in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Japan's merchandise trade
surplus in August rose by 24.7 percent from a year earlier to
896.7 billion yen (about 6.3 billion U.S. dollars) as increasing
exports overwhelmed falling imports, the Finance Ministry said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Japan's global imports in August fell by three percent from a
year before to 3,119.0 billion yen (about 21.8 billion dollars),
while exports rose by two percent to 4,015.7 billion yen (about
27.9 billion dollars), the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Trade surplus with the United States, its largest trade
partner, soared 28.4 percent to 431.0 billion yen (about 3.0
billion dollars) in August, up for the 23rd consecutive month.
</P>
<P>
Japan's surplus with Asian countries fell by 52.5 percent to
240.9 billion yen (about 1.7 billion dollars) due to a sharp drop
in Japan's exports to the region.
</P>
<P>
As for trade with the European Union (EU), Japan's surplus
swelled 86.3 percent to 276.9 billion yen (about 1.9 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The average foreign exchange rate used for the August report
was 143.48 yen to one U.S. dollar, compared with 117.12 yen a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the August trade report, an economist at a private
financial institution said a trade spat between Tokyo and
Washington could flare up in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the continued growth in Japan's trade surplus with
the United States "had been hidden by a vibrant U.S. economy," the
economist said the resurgence of a bilateral trade row could occur
unless the yen's depreciation is reversed much more
substantially.

Around 50 people died late Sunday when a heavy missile hit a
shopping center in the western area of Karte Parwarn, three hours
after another rocket killed at least 16 people in Khairkhana in
the north.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted hospital sources as saying that they had so
far received 36 bodies and more than 200 wounded from the two
attacks.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the rocket attacks were carried out by the
anti-Taliban forces as a retaliation to the indiscriminate bombing
by the Taliban jet fighters on Wardag province on September 19.
</P>
<P>
One report quoted a Taliban policeman as saying in Kabul it
was difficult to know the exact number of victims, but casualties
could be "disastrous" as the market was crowded during the evening
shopping hours.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Students, Common People Rally in Jakarta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian students and
common people staged separate rallies in front of the House of
Representatives (DPR) building here Monday, urging the government
to take measures to solve the country's problems.
</P>
<P>
About 500 students stressed the need for national
reconciliation in settling the country's problems and preventing
disintegration.
</P>
<P>
Rally coordinator Andi Faizal said national reconciliation is
needed to accommodate the people's interests.
</P>
<P>
Tensions in Indonesia have flared as the country's descent into
poverty worsens. Thousands of ethnic Chinese have fled the country
after being targeted in fierce rioting in recent months.
Separatist protests have also mounted in some provinces since
former president Soeharto resigned on May 21.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the government has decided to establish a
National Reconciliation Team to head off the rising threat of
disintegration and separatism in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a group which consisted of men, housewives and
children belonging to several organizations sought a reduction in
the prices of staple food and the setting up of a National Reform
Board.
</P>
<P>
Rally coordinator Anhar Nasution said it is time for the
government to form such a board to solve the economic problems.
However, the board membership should exclude government officials
as their presence could undermine the board's independence.
</P>
<P>
The rallies were peaceful but security officers stood guard at
the gates. Jakarta Police chief Maj. Gen. Noegroho Djajusman
called for an end to the holding of rallies which only disturb
public order.
</P>
<P>
Students in Jakarta and other cities held rallies almost every
day this month to protest the spiraling prices of the basic
commodities. They urged President B.J. Habibie to take concrete
measures to solve the economic problems.
</P>
<P>
In Banjarmasin, capital of South Kalimantan province, thousands
of commuters were stranded Monday as thousands of public
transportation drivers went on strike to demand for a reduction in
the prices of vehicle spare parts.
</P>
<P>
The strike paralyzed the city as drivers of city, inter-city
and inter-province transportation stopped operations, according to
Antara News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Strikes staged by public transportation drivers have recently
hit several cities in the country, including Medan, capital of
North Sumatra province, and Samarinda, capital of East Kalimantan
province.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Ruling Party Youth Chief Detained </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's ruling United
Malays National Organization (UMNO) Youth chief Ahmad Zahid Hamidi
and four leaders of the Islamic Youth Movement of Malaysia (IYMM)
were arrested Monday under the Internal Security Act, police said.
</P>
<P>
Zahid was picked up by police in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, East
Malaysia, Monday morning, Director of the Criminal Investigation
Department Yaacob Mohamed Amin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The four IYMM leaders -- president Ahmad Azam Abdul Rahman,
deputy president Mukhtar Redhuan, secretary-general Shaharuddin
Badaruddin and vice president Abdul Halim Ismail -- were arrested
at the IYMM headquarters here, Yaacob said.
</P>
<P>
All were detained under the Internal Security Act for
threatening national security.
</P>
<P>
Yaacob said they were identified as "henchmen" of sacked
Malaysian deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim to carry out acts
prejudicial to public order.
</P>
<P>
Anwar himself was detained at his house here Sunday night and
police later said he had also been detained for threatening
national security.
</P>
<P>
The arrest of Anwar came hours after he led a huge rally at the
National Mosque here in another protest of his removal from his
cabinet posts on September 2 and expulsion from the UMNO of which
he was deputy president after being implicated in allegations of
sexual misconduct.
</P>
<P>
A group of his supporters later made their way without Anwar to
the Putra World Trade Center where the UMNO headquarters is
located and created a disturbance causing some damage to property.
And then they marched to the official residence here of Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad where police prevented their advance by
using water cannons and tear gas.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued Monday by Public Relations Superintendent
Ghazali Haji Md Amin of the Federal Police Headquarters here said
Anwar's arrest was in connection with the disturbances caused by
his supporters on the afternoon of September 20, 1998 when
"illegal assemblies and rioting" took place threatening internal
security and public order, and causing damage to public property
and disruption to traffic.
</P>
<P>
After his dismissal, Anwar launched what he termed as a
"reformation movement" and addressed a series of public rallies in
the country.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Moves to Achieve APEC Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Representatives from the Thai ministries of commerce, industry,
finance and foreign affairs will meet at the end of this month to
discuss issues of products, time frame and final tariff rates in
liberalizing the trade with 17 other APEC member economies.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's revision plan follows a recent meeting of APEC
senior officials in Kuantan, Malaysia, which failed to break the
deadlock in the realization of the Early Voluntary Sectoral
Liberalization (EVSL) plan that APEC leaders agreed to adopt last
year.
</P>
<P>
The EVSL requires members to open up trade in nine priority
areas with the target of eliminating tariffs by the year 2005. The
nine areas are chemical, energy, environmental goods and
services, fish and fisheries, forestry, gems and jewelry, medical
equipment, toys and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Thailand confirmed its intention to participate in all sectors
but wants to reserve tariff rates of between zero and 5 percent
for a number of sensitive products in each sector.
</P>
<P>
With this plan, Thailand will only meet the APEC requirement
in the gems and jewelry sector, which will be traded at the final
tariff rate of zero to 5 percent in 2005. Trade in other sectors
will be freed up between 2005 and 2019, according to the
officials.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's reluctance to conform with the APEC end-date and
end-rate in other sectors drew criticism at the APEC meeting in
Kuantan, Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
To bridge the gap with APEC's plan, Thailand could begin
reducing tariffs from 2003 or 2004, an official said on condition
of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Thailand said earlier that it has set 2005 as the starting
point for reducing tariffs because it wants the nine-member
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to enjoy similar
privileges under the grouping's free trade area plan which is due
to begin operations in 2003.
</P>
<P>
It also wants maximum flexibility in terms of the APEC time
frame, which allows developing countries to liberalize trade by
2020 to boost revenue from collecting import tax. Developed
countries are set to free up trade by 2010.
</P>
<P>
APEC members have to submit their revised plans by the end of
October to Malaysia which is hosting the APEC summit in
mid-November.

<HEADLINE> El Paso, ACOM to Build 1,000-km Oil Pipeline in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 21 (Xinhua) -- American and Tanzanian
companies have contracted to build a 1,000-kilometer oil pipeline
at a cost of 400 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The line, extending from the Tanzanian capital of Dar es
Salaam to the Mwanza Region in the northwest, will be able to
transport about 1.2 million tons of petroleum products annually.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-based El Paso Energy International and the
Africommerce International Limited (ACOM) of Tanzania have a
joint share of more than 50 percent of the project which is to be
launched in 1998 and completed in 2002.
</P>
<P>
Vice-President of El Paso International for Europe and Africa,
Bradley Lingo, and ACOM chairman Elisante Muro, signed an
agreement for the the development of the project here last week,
local newspapers said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the money will be pooled by banking institutions
and multilateral agencies like the International Monetary Fund,
the International Finance Corporation, and the African
Development Bank, Lingo said.
</P>
<P>
He named others as the Commonwealth Development Corporation,
the Eastern African Development Bank, and the South African
Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
The line will provide a reliable supply to Mwanza, a Lake
Victoria region, which has one third of Tanzania's population, as
well as to Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda and
Uganda, Muro said.
</P>
<P>
Muro, however, acknowledged that the project will face stiff
competition from similar facilities in east Africa, including the
Nairobi-Eldoret pipeline in Kenya, which is due to be extended to
the Ugandan capital of Kampala.

<HEADLINE> E. Africa Plans to Stamp out Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The revenue authorities of
Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania will from early next year revoke the
licenses of importers caught smuggling.
</P>
<P>
The decision comes at a time when smuggling is rife in the
east African region, especially in Uganda, where traders say they
are being driven out of business, the local weekly East African
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The three countries are compiling a directory of all importers
in the region. Those caught smuggling will be de-registered.
</P>
<P>
"We will work with the registrars of companies to get such
companies out," Elly Rwakakoko, the Commissioner General of the
Uganda Revenue Authority, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Rwakakoko said the revenue authorities of the three countries
had been working together to end smuggling in the region.
</P>
<P>
Importers and clearing agents currently caught with smuggled
goods in Uganda are currently only forced to pay the necessary
taxes before their goods are released.
</P>
<P>
The new measure, according to Rwakakoko, will throw smugglers
out of business for good.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Uganda and Kenya introduced cash bonds as a measure
to curb dumping and smuggling but they have yet to make an
impact in Uganda, said the report.

<HEADLINE> China Protects Largest Inland Fresh-Water Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, September 21 (Xinhua) -- China has taken a series of
steps to protect Bosten Lake, the largest inland fresh-water
lake in the country, and these efforts are producing results.
</P>
<P>
Monitoring results by local environmental departments show that
the water level in the lake, located in northwest China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region, has stopped dropping, the mineralization
of the lake water has been eased, and the environment around the
lake is improving.
</P>
<P>
Projects to protect the lake have included the construction of
water diversion projects, popularization of water-saving
technologies, and the exploitation and use of underground water.
</P>
<P>
These measures have reduced the amount of water taken from the
lake to irrigate surrounding farmland from 1.27 billion cubic
meters to 1.02 billion cubic meters annually.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, local governments have restricted the
establishment of polluting enterprises on the lake side, and seven
heavily polluting enterprises have been closed since last year.
</P>
<P>
The Bosten Lake used to be home to more than 20 kinds of fish
and was one of the four largest reed production bases in the
country. However, the water area of the lake was reduced by 130
square kilometers, and the water level dropped by nearly two
meters for a variety of reasons.
</P>
<P>
A project aimed at reclaiming 20,000 hectares for reed production
to curb the saltization of the lake water is now underway.

<HEADLINE> Meteorologists Looking For More Accurate Snow Forecasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Meteorologists from northwest
China's Qinghai Province and the Tibet Autonomous Region started
their discussion today to seek better ways to forecast snowstorms
on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.
</P>
<P>
The gathering of meteorologists every autumn has helped
forecast snowstorms on the plateau region in 1992, 1995, and
1997. Ma Lin, head of the Qinghai Meteorology Bureau, says that the
cooperation of meteorologists from Qinghai and Tibet is expected
to make forecasts more accurate.
</P>
<P>
The comprehensive analysis of sun spots, marine temperatures,
air currents, and radiation of the sun will help correct forecast
of snowstorms, which in turn will help relief work, experts say.
</P>
<P>
In the past, there was only one heavy snowstorm every decade in
the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, but there has been one heavy or
moderate snowstorm every three years in recent years, resulting in
heavy losses, sources from the symposium said.

<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Scholars, lawyers and trade
and insurance representatives from nearly 20 countries and regions
met this morning at the Third International Conference on
Maritime Law in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The four-day conference, sponsored by the China
Maritime Law Association (CMLA) and the China Council for the
Promotion of International Trade, will cover marine insurance,
maritime shipping laws, bills of lading, charters, detaining
ships, liability, ship financing, salvage, arbitration and
litigation, regional conflicts, and international marine safety.
</P>
<P>
Since China set up its maritime court in 1984, it has seen an
annual increase of maritime cases as shipping and foreign trade
increased. The court has handled over 20,000 maritime cases, 20
percent of them dealing with overseas affairs.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Chunyun, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of
China's National People's Congress, spoke at the opening ceremony

foreign trade and ocean shipping and that the legal system has
played an important role in standardizing legal affairs in ocean
shipping and other marine undertakings.
</P>
<P>
It has also provided a legal base for China's maritime
judgement and arbitration that will bring China's international
shipping and trade more into the international market.

<HEADLINE> New Oil Field Found in South China Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The China National Offshore
Oil Corp (CNOOC) has discovered a new oilfield in the Pearl River
Basin in the South China Sea with geological oil reserves
estimated at 20 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The new offshore field, called Panyu 4-2, is located some 160
kilometers southeast of Hong Kong in the 15/34 block of the South
China Sea and has been contracted by the Santa Fe company of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
According to the CNOOC source, the 15/34 block was contracted
to Santa Fe in January 1997. So far, a group of oil and gas-
bearing structures including Panyu 2-1, Panyu 4-2, and Panyu 9-2
have been found in the block.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe the newly discovered Panyu 4-2 oilfield is
rich in oil and gas reserves, with an oil layer 169.2
meters thick.
</P>
<P>
A CNOOC official noted that the discovery of Panyu 4-2 has
proved to be another major breakthrough following the Xijiang 34-3
oil-bearing structure in the basin of the Pearl River in the South
China Sea.
</P>
<P>
Experts expect the offshore Panyu area to be the fifth group of
oilfields in the eastern part of the Pearl River Basin after
the successful exploration of oilfield groups of Huizhou,
Xijiang, Lufeng and Liuhua.

KUALA LUMPUR, September 21 (Xinhua) -- An unnamed Pakistani
shooter was disqualified from the Commonwealth Games for failing
a doping test, officials said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The shooter, whom the organizers hold back the name, was found
to have used beta-blockers, a banned substance that can help
lessen the heart rate to control the shaking of their hands, said
Michael Fennell, chairman of the Commonwealth Games Federation.
</P>
<P>
The disqualification was the sole doping incident reported at
the 16th Commonwealth Games, which were ending later Monday.
</P>
<P>
Fennel said the federation was not looking at the possibility
of introducing blood tests. Urine tests now are used to check for
use of banned drugs.

According to the declaration, countries in Central Asia
face similar problems in their development process. Therefore the
key to sustainable development in the region lies in enhancing
regional cooperation and cooperation between countries.

The 170 symposium participants urged governments in the region
to make commitments to sustainable development and called for the
participation of the general public and all social groups.

<HEADLINE> Company Starts Maintenance on Saudi Arabian Aircraft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing-based Aircraft
Maintenance Engineering Corporation Ltd (AMECO) has begun major
maintenance on a Boeing 747-100 aircraft of Saudi Arabian Airlines.
</P>
<P>
The service includes a D-check, modifications of the head of
the plane, strut and cabin reconfiguration and repainting. The
D-check refers to regular structure maintenance every six
years. This is the highest level of aircraft maintenance, experts
noted.
</P>
<P>
This effort signals that China's aircraft maintenance service
has entered the Middle East's aviation market, said officials
from the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC).
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabian Airlines has a fleet of 76 passenger jets,
including 24 Boeing-747 airliners. It has expressed willingness
for further cooperation with AMECO.
</P>
<P>
AMECO was jointly set up by Air China and Germany's Lufthansa
in May 1989 as China's largest aircraft maintenance venture.
</P>
<P>
The company has carried out different levels of maintenance
services on dozens of aircraft from the United States, New
Zealand, Australia and Viet Nam over the past few years,
sharpening its competitive edge on the international aviation
market.

<HEADLINE> NZ Government Intends to Cut Social Welfare Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government
 intends to cut social welfare spending as part of its response to
the economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
The Evening Post, a Wellington-based newspaper, reported Monday
that the National-led minority government is lobbying independent
members of Parliament to get their support for a package of
measures it plans to announce in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley foreshadowed a
tightening of spending last week when she called on the community
to debate what services should be available universally and "which
we should target to people with specific needs." She also
announced that the government would try to revamp accident
compensation.
</P>
<P>
James Funnell, spokesman for the New Zealand Ministry of
Foreign Affairs and Trade, told Xinhua Monday morning that the
ministry is reviewing the costs of its 48 embassies, high
commissions and consulates overseas and could be forced to close
some of them because of financial pressures.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest economic forecast released by the New
Zealand Treasury, the country will suffer a negative economic
growth of 0.5 percent in the year to March 1999 and the government
will have a deficit of 700 million NZ dollars in 1999-2000 and 300
million NZ dollars the year after. But local economists hold that
the economic situation in New Zealand is more serious than the
government's forecasts.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the New Zealand government also intends to
sell state-owned electricity generator Contact Energy, which could
return 800 million to one billion NZ dollars to prevent its
accounts from being plunged into the red.
</P>
<P>
The intended cuts in social welfare spending would follow the
cutting of 600 million NZ dollars (304 million U.S. dollars) in
the government's spending earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> Top Airline Promotes Sales in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- One of the world's major
airlines has increased efforts to explore the China market as
commercial aviation everywhere feels the effects of the Asian
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
United States-based United Airlines (UA) has reinstituted its
discount promotion campaign throughout China in a bid to draw
additional business from one of the most active and promising
aviation market in the world.
</P>
<P>
Through its network of ticket offices and travel agents around
the country, UA offers travellers from China to the U.S. discount
fares of 8,888 yuan (about 1,000 U.S. dollars) for a round-trip
ticket. This discount fare will be available from September 19 to
October 31.
</P>
<P>
This is the second large-scale sales promotion campaign UA
has conducted in China this year.
</P>
<P>
Chris Lin, general manager of UA in China, said that China has
become an active and promising market for foreign airlines in the
past few years, and that every new operation UA has started in the
country has been successful.
</P>
<P>
China is now the only Asian country that remains attractive to
long-term foreign investments. Despite the deepening impact of the
financial crisis in the rest of east Asia, China has kept its
currency from devaluation, and is expected to achieve an 8 percent
economic growth rate this year.
</P>
<P>
Last week, UA chose China to initiate its world-wide plan to
sell electronic tickets for overseas flights.
</P>
<P>
United Airlines now accounts for 30 percent of the civil
aviation market between the the U.S. and China. It operates 14
schedule flights from Beijing and Shanghai to the U.S. every week,
as well as flights from Hong Kong to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Last year, UA had a global net income of more than 1.3 billion
U.S. dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Don King's license to
promote fights in Florida might be suspended or revoked by the
States Athletics Commission.
</P>
<P>
The commission's decision may also test its credibility, as
its executive director denied allegations that King was given
special treatment in return for a 100,000 dollars donation to a
boxing foundation.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Senator John McCain has asked Florida Governor Lawton
Chiles to investigate allegations that the commission is caught
up in a conflict of interest in its dealings with King.
</P>
<P>
"The governor's office has concerns, and we will be taking
appropriate action," Chiles spokeswoman Edie Ousley said. "We are
not taking this issue lightly."
</P>
<P>
Michael Scionti, executive director of the commission, was ap
pointed by the commission as its top administrator in 1996. He
is a friend of Chiles and a former amateur boxer.
</P>
<P>
Scionti created a boxing foundation last year, and announced a
major contribution from Don King Productions. "He floored me when
he said 100,000 dollars," Scionti said.
</P>
<P>
Scointi denied the allegation that the 100,000 charity
donation from King appeared to buy the promoter special
treatment. Judd Burstein has asked the commission to revoke
King's license.

<HEADLINE> Flood Causes Heavy Losses to Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has suffered heavy
losses in the over-two-month-long flood which started hitting the
country in early July.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural sector alone recorded a total loss of 37.18
billion taka (about 791 million U.S. dollars) in the prolonged
flood, including an estimated production loss of 2 million tons of
rice, Food and Agriculture Minister Begum Motia Chowdhury said
Sunday, The Independent daily newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the country would face a food deficit of 4.3
million tons this year, including a normal annual shortfall of 2.3
million tons, she said.
</P>
<P>
The figures were based on preliminary assessment and the
overall loss in the agricultural sector might increase when the
final figures become available, according to the agriculture
minister.
</P>
<P>
The minister ruled out any possibility of a food crisis in the
country after the flood, saying the government is importing 1
million tons of food grains and the private sector 1.5 million to
2 million tons and another 1.5 million tons of food aid is
expected from donor countries and agencies.
</P>
<P>
In the industrial sector, the flood disrupted production in
many factories and caused significant damage to the permanent
assets of major industries, Commerce and Industries Minister
Tofail Ahmed was quoted as saying on Sunday by the
English-language newspaper The New Nation.
</P>
<P>
He said small and cottage industries were badly hit, with some
83,000 such businesses out of more than 500,000 affected by the
flood.
</P>
<P>
The government has urged the Federation of Bangladeshi Chambers
of Commerce and Industries, the central bank and the Shilpa Bank
to separately assess the flood damage to the industrial units,
according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
Despite the damage, Ahmed was hopeful that the country's export
target this year would be achieved. "We will be able to achieve
the 560 million dollar export target of the five-year
export-import policy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Communications Minister Anwar Hossain Manju said on
Sunday that during the devastating flood this year, 9,448
kilometers of roads were submerged, 4,269 kilometers of road
embankments, 4,078 kilometers of pavement and 54 ferry ghats were
damaged in the country.
</P>
<P>
A total of 372 bridges and culverts were destroyed while 820
bridges and culverts were damaged, he said.
</P>
<P>
He estimated that around 14.32 billion taka (about 304.7
million dollars) would be needed for reconstruction of national
and regional highways and feeder roads badly damaged by the severe
flooding.
</P>
<P>
The Road and Highways Department under the ministry has about
20,287 kilometers of road, including 2,862 kilometers of national
highways, 1,565 kilometers of regional highways and 15,860
kilometers of feeder roads.
</P>
<P>
And 660.38 million taka (about 14 million dollars) would be
needed to reconstruct institutions under the Social Welfare
Ministry, a ministry source said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 3 million people were seriously affected and more than
1,000 died in the country during this year's flood which experts
described as the "worst" in the region in the past 100 years.

<HEADLINE> Highway Helps Protect Taklimakan Desert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, September 21 (Xinhua) -- A highway running through the
Taklimakan Desert, the largest in China, has been conducive to
protecting the local environment since it opened three years ago.
</P>
<P>
A recent investigation has dispelled concerns expressed by some
experts that the highway would pose a threat to the environment,
since now desert animals and plants both thriving along the road.
</P>
<P>
The numerous ponds and water holes left by the road
construction are also providing greater water resources for the
animals and plants, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
The investigation also found that natural sand plants and newly
planted greenery along the road are also serving to control the
shifting desert sands.
</P>
<P>
Located in the heart of the Tarim Basin in Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, the Taklimakan was known as the "Sea of Death"

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Is Famine Imminent Bangladesh? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- When flooding waters are fast
receding after ravaging Bangladesh for more than two months and
inflicting heavy losses both of life and property, fears of a
possible famine after the deluge are looming large in the country.
</P>
<P>
The devastating flood, which once submerged nearly
three-fourths of the country's land, seriously affected some 30
million people in 52 out of the country's 64 districts and left
more than 1,000 people dead.
</P>
<P>
Losses are enormous. Some 1.45 million hectares of crops were
washed away, incurring a loss of 38 billion taka (about 808.5
million U.S. dollars) in agriculture, Food and Agriculture
Minister Begum Motia Chowdhury said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The damage to crops may produce an estimated food shortage of 2
million tons, according to official estimates and some experts put
the loss of food grains at 2.5 million to 2.7 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh already suffers an annual food deficit of some 2.3
million tons in normal years and with flood-caused losses this
year, the deficit soars to 4 million tons, said the agriculture
minister.
</P>
<P>
And experts said however that the figure may be as high as 4.5
million to 4.7 million tons, leaving a huge gap for the government
to fill.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has repeatedly assured the nation
of adequate food supply and vowed that none "will be allowed to
die of starvation," pinning her hope on donors' assistance and
imports by the government and by the private sector.
</P>
<P>
More than 4 million tons of food grains would be made available
through import and external aid, Hasina told the nation last
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The government would import 1 million tons and the private
sector 1.5 million tons while the remaining 1.5 million tons would
be met by assistance from donor countries and agencies, she said.
"We are expecting a stock of 600,000 to 700,000 tons of food
grains after meeting the deficit" at the end of the financial year
ending on July 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The World Food Program has promised to provide an extra 350,000
tons of food grain for the flood-stricken people, in addition to
its allocation of 542,000 tons, and the United States has also
announced 400,000 tons of food aid.
</P>
<P>
Other donor countries and international agencies have pledged
some 110,000 tons. But a pledge is just a pledge and it probably
won't come soon enough, observers here said, considering the
government's slow response to the severity of flood and its
delayed appeal for international assistance.
</P>
<P>
The observers also doubted whether the prime minister could
keep her promise. Even if she could get what she promised, they
said, problem exists concerning how to distribute the relief
adequately and efficiently and ensure that those in real need
could get their share.
</P>
<P>
The official relief operations have been conducted by
ministers, members of parliament of the ruling party and ruling
party workers, a report in the latest issue of the Dhaka Courier
weekly magazine said, reportedly focusing on their constituencies.
</P>
<P>
And the government has turned down a proposal of the opposition
to set up an "All-Party Flood Relief Committee," which the
opposition said could improve the efficiency and fairness in
relief distribution. The opposition has repeatedly accused the
government of "failing to stand by the flood-hit people" and of
corruption and mismanagement in distributing relief materials.
</P>
<P>
If the government's claim of no mismanagement in relief
distribution was true, the observers said, it should not be afraid
of setting up the all party committee, which would unite all in
undertaking and overseeing relief activities and thus prove wrong
allegations of irregularities and pilferage in distribution of
relief goods.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government has drawn up a master plan for
feeding the poor and for post-flood rehabilitation, under which it
will launch six programs -- Test Relief, Gratuitous Relief,
Vulnerable Group Feeding (VGF), Food for Work, Vulnerable Group
Development Program, and Food for Education.
</P>
<P>
Under the three-month program of Vulnerable Group Feeding card
system, which started early this month and will last till the end
of November, 2.5 million flood-affected families would each be
given a VGF card and each card holder would get 16 kilograms of
rice a month as relief, Finance Minister Shah A.M.S. Kibria told
reporters early this month.
</P>
<P>
But whether the flood victims can become self-supporting after
that is not known, as many of them have lost everything they had
in the prolonged flood and winter is coming to the country very
soon, the observers said.
</P>
<P>
The task before the government is twofold -- to make sure that
food is available and accessible to the poor and to improve their
purchasing capacity by providing the poor with work and loan,
according to the observers.
</P>
<P>
Whether a famine would occur in post-flood Bangladesh depends
not on the volume of food available, but on the management of
relief operations and implementation of the plans, and ultimately,
depends on the government itself, they added.

<HEADLINE> India's CPCB to Take Steps to Control Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 21 (Xinhua) -- India's Central Pollution
Control Board (CPCB) is expected to take new steps for all major
ports to check marine pollution at the country's coast, official
sources said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
This move followed observations by CPCB that several ports were

found directly or indirectly responsible for marine pollution.
State
pollution control boards have also been asked by CPCB to submit a
time-bound action plan against this type of pollution.
</P>
<P>
Annually about 1,600 billion cubic meters of waste-laden upland

waters are discharged through the rivers into the coastal area.
The
marine environment in coastal areas is being subjected to pressure

from both land-based and offshore activities since three of the
four
largest metros are situated on the coast, besides 11 major ports
and
140 intermediate and minor ports in the country, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, over 5,000 million cubic meters of domestic sewerage
containing decomposable organic objects together with community
waste
water find their way into the sea every year. This is in addition
to
an estimated 1,000 million cubic meters of waste waters from
industries and farms.
</P>
<P>
Besides, solid wastes like heavy metals, pesticides, complex
organic compounds and other industrial effluents are also dumped
into
the sea.
</P>
<P>
The central authority, which supervises the Coastal Ocean
Monitoring and Prediction System, has also decided to take up a
comprehensive program on coastal action plan aimed at assessing
pollution from different sources, their pathways and time-bound
long-
term programs to curb them.

LANZHOU, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Gansu
Province plans to put 11.8 billion yuan into reinforcing
agriculture in the Hexi Corridor over the next five years, aiming
at raising its GDP and peasants' annual income to twice the
current level.
</P>
<P>
The Hexi Corridor, with a population of four million people, is
one of the most important grain-production bases in western
China. Its GDP is 20.7 billion yuan, and peasants' average annual
income is over 2,000 yuan per capita.
</P>
<P>
A provincial government official said that by agricultural
industrialization, the Hexi Corridor will establish a water-saving
agricultural system, build up hi-tech agricultural zones, and
erect a series of wholesale markets for agricultural products.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China to Develop Computer Operating System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- China's largest computer
software company will join hands with Compaq Computer of the
United States to develop one of the most powerful computer
operating systems in the world.
</P>
<P>
China Computer Software and Technology Service Company will use
Compaq's Digital UNIX technology to develop a Chinese-based
64-digit operating system known as "COSIX."
</P>
<P>
The two companies announced last week they have reached initial
agreement on cooperative development of the new system.
</P>
<P>
General manager of the Chinese software company, Wang Zhigang,
said cooperation will bring to the Chinese market a
technologically advanced, safe, 64-digit Chinese UNIX operating
system.
</P>
<P>
This powerful system is believed to be a match for Microsoft's
latest product.
</P>
<P>
The new operating system will be put under Chinese trademark,
which means that China will own the software copyright.
</P>
<P>
China Computer Software and Technology Service Company, a
subsidiary of the Ministry of Information Technology (MII), is a
national base of software development and production in north
China. The COSA V1.1 system platform developed by the company has
won recommendations from the China Computer Software Association
as one of the ten best software products of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The new operating system will be a supplementary software for
the system platform, which is run entirely in Chinese instead of
English.
</P>
<P>
The development of the new software system is a national
research and development project which will enable China to
maintain copyright ranging from core systems to surface software.
</P>
<P>
Compaq has been merged with Digital Equipment, a major
U.S. computer company, and Compaq's UNIX system has been a major
rival to Microsoft's Windows system in the global market.
</P>
<P>
"We are glad that China Computer Software and Technology
Service Company picked us as a cooperative partner. We believe
this is a very effective alliance for both parties," a senior
Compaq official said.
</P>
<P>
The newly founded MII has announced that promoting the
development of national software industry is one of the ministry's
major tasks.
</P>
<P>
Annual output of China's software industry has now exceeded one
billion U.S. dollars, with more than 30 million U.S. dollars worth
of the products exported per year.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Publishers Find Confidence in Chinese Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Overseas publishers are
becoming confident in the Chinese market, a spokesman for the
Press and Publications Administration said today.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that overseas publishers sold books valued at 2.33
million U.S. dollars at the recently concluded Beijing
International Book Fair, up 38 percent over the last fair.
</P>
<P>
"More foreigners are willing to sell books in China, and their
confidence in the market is increasing. This is a result of
China's progress in copyright protection," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the country joined the Berne Convention in 1992, it has
strengthened the crackdown on copyright violators, and China's
copyright laws are expected to be revised in accordance with
advanced foreign standards.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that unauthorized translations of foreign
books have been curbed and every publishing house has been ordered
to buy copyrights with the help of agencies.
</P>
<P>
At the Beijing fair, the United States, the Netherlands and the
United Kingdom were the three biggest sellers, and medical,
economic and electronics books proved to be the favorites among
Chinese readers.
</P>
<P>
Chinese publishers decided to import 2,400 titles at the fair,
which was attended by 35 countries and international publishing
organizations.
</P>
<P>
China publishes 100,000 books annually, ranking first in the
world.

<P>
STOCKHOLM, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Sweden's ruling Social

in the weekend general election, has vowed to rule on by seeking
support from other parties.
</P>
<P>
According to official results, the SDP led with 131 seats in
the 349-member Riksdag parliament with just 36.6 percent of the

The figure, 30 seats less than what the SPD won in 1994, marked
the poorest performance by Social Democrats in their 75-year
history.

<P>
Prime Minister Goran Persson, after the announcement of the
election result, said the SPD "will continue to govern" but he
planned to negotiate with possible partners on forming a cabinet.
</P>
<P>
"The new situation might be that we must need the support of
two other parties, for which we are not unprepared," he said.
</P>
<P>
The left wing of the Riksdag, consisting of the SDP, the Left
party and the environmentalist Green party, retained the majority
with a total of 190 seats.
</P>
<P>
The Leftists won 43 seats or 12 percent and become the third
largest party in the country while the Green party won 4.4 percent
and 16 seats.
</P>
<P>
The opposition right wing got 159 seats and 44.3 percent of the
votes.
</P>
<P>
The Moderates won 22.6 percent and 81 seats (up one), the
Centralists 5.2 percent and 19 seats (down eight), the Liberals
4.7 percent and 17 seats (down nine) while the Christian Democrats
won 11.8 percent and 42 seats (up 15) to become the fourth largest
party.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil ran
the fastest marathon in history on Sunday, surpassing the
10-year-old mark by 45 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian clocked two hours six minutes five seconds after
breaking away from the pack at the midway point of the 25th
Berlin Marathon.
</P>
<P>
Da Costa who finished fifth in Berlin last year in 2:09:07,
was faster more than a minute ahead of Kenyan Josephat Kiprono
who clocked 2:07:26. Another Kenyan, Samson Kandie, was third in
2:09:11.
</P>
<P>
"I came simply to run under 2:08 but the conditions were so
good I just decided to go for it," said 28-year-old Da Costa.
</P>
<P>
"At the start I felt a bit weak then I noticed I was going
well. My manager shouted to me after 39 kms," said the Brazilian.
</P>
<P>
Da Costa's time bettered the mark of 2:06.50 set by Ethiophian
Belayneh Dinsamo in Rotterdam on April 17, 1988.
</P>
<P>
He won 40,000 marks (23,850 US dollars) for first place and a
100,000 mark (59,630 dollars ) world record bonus.
</P>
<P>
Da Costa is virtually unknown internationally but is famous at
home for being the first Brazilian winner in 30 years of the
famous San Silvestre road race through Sao Paulo at New Year, a
feat he achieved four years ago.
</P>

in second in 2:28:18. Renata Kokowska of Poland was third in
2:31:53.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Form Fisheries Body to Deal With ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is planning to form a
fisheries organization under the Ministry of Livestock and
Fisheries to facilitate tasks of the sector in dealing with the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
A coordination meeting on the formation of the ASEAN-Myanmar
Fisheries Organization was held here Sunday, attended by Deputy
Minister U Aung Thein.
</P>
<P>
Rules for the establishment of the organization were discussed.
</P>
<P>
Since integration into the ASEAN in July last year, Myanmar has
been working closely with other member nations, forming respective
committees and groups in all sectors including fisheries to handle
the country's affairs with respect to ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
In June, Myanmar hosted a regional seminar for Southeast and
East Asia, joining in discussions with experts from countries in
the region on integrated coastal zone management and presenting
its views on the establishment of an appropriate coordinating
mechanism for integrated management and sustainable development of
coastal and marine areas and their resources at both local and
national levels.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar's meat and fish
sector increased by 6.4 percent in output value in the 1997-98
fiscal year which ended in March, becoming the third largest
contributor to the gross domestic product (GDP) after agriculture
and manufacturing and accounting for 7.3 percent of the year's GDP
which grew by 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in the sector, mostly from Australia,
Bangladesh, China, Germany, Japan and Thailand, exceeded 275
million U.S. dollars in 18 projects at the end of June this year.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investment Up in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Investment in Shanghai from
the European Union and the United States increased nearly three
times in January-August period of this year over the same period
last year, according to local sources.
</P>
<P>
In the first eight months of this year, investment from Asian
countries dropped dramatically due to the Asian financial crisis,
however, total contracted overseas investment grew by one-fourth,
reaching 4.77 billion U.S. dollars which already exceeded this
year's target of 4 billion U.S. dollars set by the Shanghai
Municipal People's Government.
</P>
<P>
Investment from E.U. and U.S. multinational companies was
responsible for this rise, as the U.S.'s Kodak added 1.6 billion
U.S. dollars to its investment in Shanghai and the German company
Krupp &AMP; Thyssen topped all foreign companies this year in
joint-venture investment in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Another change in this year's foreign investment in the city
was the flow of funds into the industrial sector rather than into
real estate as in the past.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's Pudong New Area still remains the hot spot for
overseas investment. In the first eight months, it absorbed 2.69
billion U.S. dollars in contracted overseas investment, a seven-
fold increase over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Shanghai has created a package plan for inviting
investment from both at home and abroad. This 4 billion U.S.
dollars plan covers 168 major projects including digital
telecommunications, new medicines, new materials, environmental
protection and green products.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 20 (Xinhua) -- ASEC Abidjan beat close rivals
Manning Rangers 3-1 in Abidjan on Sunday to extend their lead in
the race for an African Champions' League final place.
</P>
<P>
Reda Ereyahi scored four goals in a span of 17 minutes to pace
defending champions Raja Casablanca for a 6-0 victory over Young
Africans of Tanzania, setting a record in the competition.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday in group A, Dynamos of Zimbabwe continued their
surprise start with a 1-0 defeat of Tunisia's Etoile Sahel and
lead by a point from Nigerian champions Eagle Cement at the
halfway stage.
</P>
<P>
Eagle Cement beat Hearts of Oak from Ghana 1-0.
</P>
<P>
ASEC led 2-0 early in the second half through goals from
Ivorian international Sidi Badra Aliou and Donald-Olivier Sie but
quickly found their lead cut as Rangers scored with a flying
header from Solomuzi Ndimande in the 52nd minute.
</P>
<P>
Two brilliant saves from Losseni Konate kept Rangers at bay
and ASEC made safe the points with a 74th minute strike from
Maxime Gouamene, returning to the team after a one-game
suspension.
</P>
<P>
The win extended ASEC's 100 percent record in the mini-league
and gave them a five-point gap lead at the top of the standings
in group B.
</P>
<P>
Raja Casablanca are third after recording the first win of
their mini-league thanks to diminutive Ereyahi.
</P>
<P>
The Moroccan team led at half-time through Mustapha
Moustadouia but should have made greater use of the advantage of
playing against 10 men for much of the game.
</P>
<P>
Young Africans had veteran fullback Kenny Mkapa sent off on 37
minutes but did well to hold out until the last 15 minutes when
their defence collpased.
</P>
<P>
Ereyahi, after missing a succession of earlier chances, scored
four on the trot and Noureddine Ziyati added a sixth with a
penalty five minutes into injury time for a record win in the
Champions League.
</P>
<P>
The victory puts Raja back in contention but they will have to
win all three of their remaining matches to have any chance of
reaching December's final ahead of ASEC.

<HEADLINE> Effenburg Retires from German National Squad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Midfielder Stefan Effenberg
said on Sunday that he will not play for the German national team
but for the club of Bayern Munich.
</P>
<P>
"I will not play for Germany any more," Effenberg said on
Sunday, weeks after he ended a four-year absence from the
international scene, "I want to concentrate on playing for
Bayern."
</P>
<P>
Germany coah Erich Ribbeck said earlier he was aware that
Effenberg, 30, wanted to step down.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of things have come together. He's the father of three
children and the pressure on him at Bayern is very high. But he
hasn't definitively turned us down yet and has asked for time to
think until the middle of the week," Ribbeck said.
</P>
<P>
Effenberg was sent home from the 1994 World Cup in disgrace
after making an obscene gesture to German fans. He was not
selected again until Ribbeck's predecessor, Berti Vogts, recalled
him last month for two friendly matches.
</P>
<P>
Vogts quit after those games against Malta and Romania at the
beginning of this month but Ribbeck made clear Effenberg was
central to his plans.
</P>
<P>
The new coach said he had met Effenberg and his wife Martina,
who is also the player's manager, in Munich last week and asked
him to change his mind.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Furniture Companies Eye Chinese Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 21 (Xinhua) -- More than 400 furniture
makers from 19 countries and regions attended a recent
international furniture and furniture-producing equipment
exhibition in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The overseas companies, many of which were from Italy, Germany,
France, and the United States, rented half of the exhibition's
business booths with a combined floor space of 32,000 square
meters.
</P>
<P>
Italy, known as the "kingdom of furniture." sent a delegation
of some 80 companies which rented 300 booths.
</P>
<P>
During the fair, more than 30 European furniture makers
discussed business with Chinese furniture specialists on starting
joint ventures and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Officials from furniture associations of countries such as
Germany and Italy said they hoped to increase sales of
European-style furniture in China while transferring designs and
patented technologies to Chinese furniture makers.
</P>
<P>
According to Jia Qingwen, chairman of the China Furniture
Association, China, with more than 300 million families, is
emerging as the world's largest furniture market.
</P>
<P>
The United States, for example, exported 1.3 billion U.S.
dollars worth of furniture to China in 1997, making China the
second largest importer of U.S. furniture.
</P>
<P>
Some furniture dealers from Southeast Asia and Taiwan region
have started to produce furniture in the Chinese mainland to
increase their share of the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
In addition to imported and overseas-financed produced
furniture, China's 30,000 producers, with over two million
workers, produced furniture with a combined output value of 80
billion yuan in 1997. They also exported one billion U.S. dollars
worth of furniture last year.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Expected to Fight in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson, waiting for a
green light given from a psychiatrist, could be fight his first
return-bout by the end of November if he gets a license.
</P>
<P>
"If I ever get reinstated again, I'll probably make 300
million," Tyson said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He is broke despite earning more than 100 million in his last
six fights. The former heavyweight champion stands ready to cash
in with a series of fights that figure to culminate in the third
fight with Evander Holyfield, whose ears were bit by Tyson last
year in a title bout.
</P>
<P>
Though Tyson made more than 100 million in offical purses in
six fights, he is now basically broke and owes the IRS 13 million
in back taxes.
</P>
<P>
Tyson's attorney Dale Kinsella said Tyson only got 5.2 million
out of the 30 million purse he received from the second bout with
Holyfield. Kinsella promised that when Tyson resumes fighting,
the comission will be given copies of all the contracts he has
singned.
</P>
<P>
"Mike Tyson will be fighting for Mike Tyson again, not all the
people around him," Kinsella said.
</P>
<P>
Tyson had signed a contract with his former promoter Don King
and his two co-managers to give them half of everything he made.
But now Tyson has changed his lawyers and advisers. His new
advisers have already negotiated an extension of his old deal
with the Showtime network, which televises his fights via
pay-per-view.
</P>
<P>
"Win or lose, people want to see Mike Tyson," Showtime
executive Jay Larkin said. "There's an almost insatiable appetite
to see him in the ring."
</P>
<P>
Tyson must be licensed and also must either reach a deal with
King on his promotional rights or get a court to rule in his
favor. Tyson has sued King and his former managers to break
their contracts and recover money he claims was rightfully his.

WASHINGTON -- Most Americans think the Judiciary Committee of

decision to release the videotape of President Bill Clinton's
grand jury testimony, according to a new poll.

In the CBS News poll, released Sunday, 59 percent said the
committee voted to disseminate the tape Monday to embarrass and
damage Clinton. Another 35 percent said the tapes were being made

<HEADLINE> NZ Dollar Forecast to Bottom Out in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand dollar is
forecast to "bottom out" at 47 U.S. cents in the year 2000 before
recovering to about 53 U.S. cents in 2003, according to the latest
predictions of the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand currency will continue to decline but at a
slower pace, the local newspaper The Dominion Monday quoted the
institute as saying.
</P>
<P>
The foreign exchange rate of the New Zealand dollar against the
 U.S. dollar was 1:0.5078 last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Over the research group's five-year forecasting period, the
Kiwi dollar will stay fairly close to the Australian dollar,
slipping back to 80 cents of the Australian dollar in the next two
years before recovering slightly in the year 2000. Overall the
New Zealand dollar will drift down a little against the Japanese
yen, the institute said.
</P>
<P>
According to the institute, the trade-weighted index of New
Zealand will fall steadily in the next two years but strengthen in
 2001 as the current account finally improves. The institute
predicts the current account will be 3.4 percent of gross
domestic product by March in 2002 from 7.2 percent in March this
year.
</P>
<P>
Ninety-day wholesale interest rates have fallen 2.3 percent
since June with the easing of monetary conditions. The institute
expects 90-day rates to start to rise in the year 2000 as the
currency stabilizes and monetary conditions tighten.

<HEADLINE> Taihu Lake to be Phosphorus-Pollution Free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Jiangsu Province in east
China has announced a campaign for the next year to clean up
phosphorus pollution in Taihu Lake, the third largest fresh-water
lake in China.
</P>
<P>
Complete waste-water treatment plants will be set up around the
lake and regulations have been worked out prohibiting the
production or consumption of detergents containing phosphoric
elements in areas near the lake, according to a seminar held
recently in Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
The phosphoric materials in the lake has been attributed to an
over-abundance of algae in the water. The per capita annual use of
phosphoric detergents for local residents in the Taihu Lake valley
is 3.5 kilograms, and the yearly consumption of phosphoric
detergents in the valley totals about 40,000 tons, producing more
than 2,000 tons of phosphorus and accounting for 16 percent of all
pollutants discharged into the lake.
</P>
<P>
Research into and the production of non-phosphoric detergents
are in the initial stage in China, and government should encourage
the development of this industry, many experts said.

<HEADLINE> NZ Foreign Ministry Reviews Costs of Overseas Posts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand Ministry
of
Foreign Affairs and Trade is reviewing the costs of its overseas
posts and domestic operation because of financial pressures.
</P>
<P>
"Driven by economic circumstances," the ministry is conducting
a
review on the costs of its 48 embassies, high commissions and
consulates and could be forced to close some of them, James
Funnell,
spokesman of the ministry, told Xinhua Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry employs about 200 New Zealand staff in overseas
posts,
which had a total budget of 116 million NZ dollars (59 million
U.S.
dollars) in the last financial year.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is also looking into the costs of its operations
in
New Zealand, where it employs about 400 people.
</P>
<P>
Funnell said closing embassies is "one of the options," but his

ministry will do its best to "avoid doing so."
</P>
<P>
He said closing embassies could damage bilateral relations.
"It
sends a message to the host countries that we don't consider them
important enough to keep a post open. The closing of embassies
certainly means that the relationship could remain frosty for some

years. Even if we explain that it is being done for sensible
economic
reasons, they will still be upset."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the New Zealand Embassy in Beijing and a consulate
in
Shanghai, Funnel said that in view of the political and economic
relations between the two countries, the ministry is unlikely to
consider closing them. The New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs

and Trade regards them as "valuable posts," which have done a lot
of
things in promoting bilateral relations in both political and
economic fields, he said.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Medalists Meet Urged to Signal Olympic Truce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Greece's Alternate Foreign
Minister George Papandreou urged Sunday Olympic games medalists
meeting in Greece to become the symbols of the idea of an Olympic
truce.
</P>
<P>
The support of past Olympic games medalists was very important
as they could inspire and guide the young, and particularly those
coming from strife-torn regions, Papandreou said.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou made the remarks while attending the international
conference of Olympic medal winners in Olympia, which began
Sunday with the participation of 35 Greek and 120 foreign
athletes who have won a total of 300 Olympic medals.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the ancient tradition of the Olympic truce
could evolve into an effective tool for the preventation and
resolution of conflict, a fact which makes it a moral obligation
for Greece to support the respective initiatives of the
International Olympic Committee to revive the institution in a
contemporary context.
</P>
<P>
During the four-day conference, participants are expected to
discuss the issues regarding the Olympic movement and the Olympic
games, the challenge of the Olympic games and the timeless spirit
of Olympism.

<HEADLINE> Spain Beats Switzerland in Fed Cup Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario and
Conchita Martinez won the doubles in straight sets to award Spain
a 3-2 victory over Switzerland on Sunday, pacing Spain for its
fifth Fed Cup title.
</P>
<P>
Sanchez-Vicario and Martinez defeated world No. 1 Martina
Hingis and Patty Schnyder 6-0, 6-2 in a tie-breaking doubles
match after both sides split the four singles.
</P>
<P>
Both Sanchez-Vicario and Martinez competed in all four of
Spain's previous titles in 1991, 1993, 1994 and 1995 as they had
led Spain to the finals seven times in last eight years.
</P>
<P>
The two veterans rolled over their Swiss peers in the first
set in 24 minutes and sealed the competition within one hour.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss held serves until the fifth game when they failed to
save two break points, allowing the Spanish duo to leap ahead
4-2.
</P>
<P>
Leading 5-2, Spain failed to convert on their first match
point, but made the most of their second, breaking the Swiss for
the title.
</P>
<P>
"It's very disappointing, especially in front of your home
crowd," said Hingis, winner of all four Grand Slam doubles titles
this year. "But Spain is a very tough, experienced team. They've
been playing forever."

<HEADLINE> Benefit Match Kicked Off for Injuried French Policeman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 20 (Xinhua) -- A benefit match was kicked off
on Sunday by former German and French stars to raise the money
for injuried French Policeman Daniel Nivel.
</P>
<P>
Played at the German southern city of Kehl Am Rhein, the match
raised 1 million marks (600,000 US dollars) for Nivel who was
beaten by German soccer hooligans to coma in the World Cup finals
this summer.
</P>
<P>
The match has the motto "Yes to soccer without violence",
featured former national team players from the two countries,
including Rudi Voeller and Michele Hidalgo, with both sides
simply called green and white.
</P>
<P>
Top officials like Aime Jacquet, who coached France to its
recent World Cup triumph, also attended the relaxed match which
saw some 4,000 audience.
</P>
<P>
"The least I can do is set an example with my presence," said
Jacquet, now a technical director for France's soccer
organization.
</P>
<P>
German hooligans brutally attacked Nivel with an iron bar on
the streets of Lenz on June 21 before Germany's match against
Yugoslavia in pictures caught by cameras and flashed around the
world.
</P>
<P>
The 44-year-old policeman lay in a coma for six weeks, but
after rehabilitation is now able to walk a few steps.
</P>
<P>
Six of the hooligans are being held in German jails and two mo
re in France.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Start-up Creates Online Business Directory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 20 (Xinhua) -- A new company based in
Kentucky has built an online directory of American businesses
already containing 11 million profile pages.
</P>
<P>
The privately held company CommerceInc, a 28-employee start-up
backed by venture capital, wants to provide business-to-businesses
information for small and medium-sized companies in the United
States. There are about 23 million small businesses in the
country, accounting for 51 percent of the private sector's output
and employ 47 percent of the workforce.
</P>
<P>
CommerceInc has licensed the database of Dun &AMP; Bradsteet (D&AMP;B),
a leading provider of business-to-business credit, marketing, and
purchasing services worldwide. D&AMP;B's database contains information
about 50 million U.S. and foreign companies, including 11 million
credit-risk and marketing files.
</P>
<P>
In commerceInc's database, the information on each company
includes basics like company addresses and officers, products,
services and territories with links to corporate sites. It also
includes catalogs, access to D&AMP;B information and links to trade
associations, news clippings and wire services.
</P>
<P>
The directory service company plans to sell site-hosting and
building services for 200 U.S. dollars a year to the businesses
that list in its database.
</P>
<P>
Market researchers say there is opportunity in the online
market for business-to-business directories. Compared with Yellow
Pages, online directories, which can be put on Intranet, save a
lot of time and legwork.

<HEADLINE> Arsenal Beats Manchester United </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Nicky Butt was sent off for
the second consecutive game as debutant Fredrik Ljungberg wrapped
up Arsenal's fourth straight victory over Manchester United at
the English premier league on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Double winners, who have struggled for form in the early
weeks of the campaign, burst into life at exactly right the
moment and dispirited United were left chasing the game.
</P>
<P>
England manager Glenn Hoddle, former Spurs boss Christian
Gross and Simply Red star Mick Hucknall were among a 38,000
capacity crowd which squeezed into Highbury to see the first big
clash of the Premiership season.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger brought in young Stephen Hughes
for Emmanuel Petit, who was injured against Lens on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Alex Ferguson also rang the changes with Sweden's Jesper
Blomqvist, a 4.4-million US dollars signing from Parma, replacing
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Butt coming in for fellow England
international Paul Scholes.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal, who beat United 3-0 in the Charity Shield, got off to
a bright start in the autumn sunshine but United, wearing a new
all-black kit, had the first shot on goal when David Beckham's
free kick was well held by David Seaman.
</P>
<P>
Lee Dixon and Marc Overmars had a couple of shots on goal and
it was no surprise when the Gunners took the lead in the 13th
minute.
</P>
<P>
Tony Adams rose higher than Jaap Stam and Peter Schmeichel to
head in Hughes' superbly flighted free kick.
</P>
<P>
United gradually came into the game and in the 29th minute
almost drew level. Beckham was allowed to drift infield and his
shot bounced off Seaman's right hand post and spun across the
goal to safety.
</P>
<P>
But Arsenal remained a potent challenge at the other end.
</P>
<P>
In the 33rd minute Ray Parlour's deflected shot flew just past
Schmeichel's post and eight minutes later the over-worked Dane
made a fine save from Nicolas Anelka.
</P>
<P>
The Frenchman, who had not scored so far this season, would
not be denied.
</P>
<P>
On 44 minutes he beat the offside trap and ran onto a Bergkamp
through ball and when Schmeichel saved his initial shot with his
outstretched boot he pounced on the rebound and buried it.
</P>
<P>
The second half got off to an explosive start with two
bookings and a sending off.
</P>
<P>
First Hughes was booked for a foul on Beckham, who was lucky
to escape a caution himself when he appeared to tread on Hughes a
couple of minutes later.
</P>
<P>
Then in the 51st minute Butt was caught out at the back and
brought down Patrick Vieira as he headed for the penalty area.
</P>
<P>
Referee Graham Barber had no doubts and immediately brandished
the red card. Roy Keane was furious with the decision and earned
himself a yellow card for dissent.
</P>
<P>
It was Butt's second dismissal in successive games, having
been sent off against Barcelona in midweek.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal began making greater inroads into the 10 men and
Anelka should have put them 3-0 up in the 64th minute.
</P>
<P>
Yorke misplaced pass was intercepted by Hughes and he found
Anelka, who shot wide.
</P>
<P>
The Gunners' blissful afternoon was completed in the 84th
minute when Swedish super sub Ljungberg, who had come on six
minutes before, chipped Schmeichel to make it 3-0.

<HEADLINE> Cytologist Wins "America's Nobel Prize" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 20 (Xinhua) -- A cytologist and genetics
professor from Seattle has received one of the most prestigious
awards in medical research for his studies on the nature of cell
division, the Seattle Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Lee Hartwell, director of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
Center in Seattle and professor of genetics at the University of
Washington, shared with two other scientists the Albert Lasker
Basic Medical Research Award, often called "America's Nobel
Prize." The scientists discovered the universal mechanism that
controls cell division in organisms that have a nucleus. The
process is basic to understanding how cells mutate to become
cancerous and to developing ways to prevent and treat cancer.
</P>
<P>
Hartwell, 58, focused his research on yeast and discovered many
of the genes essential to its step-to-step development. He
discovered important "checkpoint genes" that are responsible for
correcting errors in DNA as cell division occurs. Learning when
and how the cell cycle derails is the centerpiece of his work.
</P>
<P>
The Seattle Times quoted Lasker Award officials as saying that
Hartwell's work has contributed greatly to the understanding of
cell growth. Many of the genes he identified may be common to
plants and animals. He is now helping direct research on drugs
that interact with the cell cycle.
</P>
<P>
Sharing the award are Yoshio Masui, professor emeritus of
zoology at the University of Toronto, and Paul Nurse,
director-general of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund in London.
</P>
<P>
The Lasker Awards focus keen attention each year on an elite
list of remarkable contributions to basic and clinical medical
research whose work has been seminal and far-reaching. Since 1945,
300 awards have been given to celebrated scientists and
physicians. Among their achievements are the discovery of the
centrality of DNA as a genetic principle, the development of a
polio vaccine, and determination of the structure of the double
helix, and identification of HIV as the cause of AIDS. Many
winners of the awards have gone on to win the Nobel Prize in
medicine or chemistry.

<HEADLINE> Most Americans Say Videotape Release Motivated by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Most Americans think the
Judiciary Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives is
motivated by a desire to embarrass the president rather than a
search for the facts in its decision to release the videotape of
President Bill Clinton's grand jury testimony, according to a new
poll.
</P>
<P>
In the CBS News poll, released Sunday, 59 percent said the
committee voted to disseminate the tape Monday to embarrass and
damage Clinton. Another 35 percent said the tapes were being made
public so others can judge whether Clinton committed perjury in
statements about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
Democrats on the committee have protested the Republican
majority's decision to make the tape public, saying the release
was intended mainly to further humiliate Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The poll also found that 57 percent didn't feel the Judiciary
Committee needed to begin impeachment hearings against the
president, while 37 percent supported hearings.
</P>
<P>
But there was little doubt among the public that those hearings
would take place. Four out of five predicted there would be
hearings, while only 14 percent said there would not.
</P>
<P>
Only a third of respondents thought Republicans and Democrats
would work together in a fair and non-partisan way. Another third
said Republicans should be blamed for what they predicted would be
partisan proceedings, while 10 percent said they blamed Democrats
and 13 percent both.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-seven percent thought it would be better for the country
if Clinton resigned, up from 32 percent in a CBS poll a week
earlier, while 61 percent -- down from 64 percent -- thought it
would be better if he finished his term.
</P>
<P>
The poll of 533 adults, taken Saturday, had a margin of error
of plus or minus 4 percentage points.

ADDIS ABABA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of World
Food Program (WFP) led by Mohammed Zajjari, WFP director for
Africa, arrived here Sunday for a five-day official visit to
inspect emergency and development food aid projects in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The delegation includes nine members of WFP executive board,
the governing body responsible for the overall policies and
direction of WFP.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the WFP office here said Ethiopia is
one of the key countries the delegation is to visit where WFP has
major food aid operations.
</P>
<P>
Judith Lewis, WFP representative in Ethiopia, said Ethiopia is
one of WFP's largest recipients of food aid worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"It is extremely important that our key decision makers have
the opportunity to witness first-hand the admirable efforts being
made to combat hunger in this country," she said.
</P>
<P>
During its stay in Ethiopia, the delegation will spend two
days visiting WFP-supported activities in the east and north of
the country, the press release said, adding that in south Wollo
they will see one of the schools participating in a school
feeding program, whereby some 100,000 rural school children
receive a daily meal provided by WFP to boost enrollment.
