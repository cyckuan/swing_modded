<HEADLINE> Raid Uncovers Y2K Stockpiling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The neighbors could see something was up.  
There had been unmarked cars on both sides of the street ``clearly 
doing surveillance,'' one man said. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, an investigation had been in the works for weeks, since  
a tip came in that big containers were being delivered to a house 
on a quiet street in the nation's capital. There were worries about 
the makings of a bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday morning at 7:30 the raid was on. The street was crowded  
with agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, with 
local police and explosives experts, with State Department 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	And. ...  
</P>
<P>
	``We did not find sufficient material to warrant a further  
investigation,'' said Brian Burns, a special agent with the ATF. 
</P>
<P>
	They did find 30 empty 55-gallon plastic drums.  
</P>
<P>
	Residents said they intended to use the drums to store water --  
out of concern about shortages that might be caused by Year 2000 
computer problems on Jan. 1.

<HEADLINE> Leyland Returns to Seen of Glory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Memories of World Series glory already were  
flooding back to Jim Leyland on Friday when he noticed the surprise 
that had been left in the visiting manager's office. 
</P>
<P>
	There, behind the desk, was the wooden rocking chair that  
previously graced the home clubhouse when Leyland managed the 
Florida Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the first thing I saw,'' said Leyland, a hint of a  
smile showing from underneath his gray mustache. 
</P>
<P>
	Leyland, now manager of the Colorado Rockies, was making his  
first visit after two years of extremes in South Florida. He 
managed the Marlins to the World Series crown in 1997, then 
suffered through a dismantling that resulted in the National 
League's worst record since 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	As far as Leyland was concerned, though, there were no bad  
times. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is where I had the greatest moment of my career,'' he  
said. ``I have no bad memories here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Florida's Game 7 victory, Leyland took a lap around the  
field, blowing kisses to the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, he relived some memories.  
</P>
<P>
	``You're just in a fog,'' he recalled. ``When I went around the  
field, I didn't know what I was doing. I had no clue. You're just 
letting out all that anxiety. I could look at people and not know 
who they were. That's how fast your heart's pumping.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leyland came to the ballpark early on Friday, passing up a trip  
to play the horses at Calder Race Course to catch up on old times 
with everyone from general manager Dave Dombrowski to the equipment 
men. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was great to see Jim and his staff,'' said John Boles, who  
preceded and followed Leyland as Marlins manager. ``I've got a lot 
of great memories from when Jim was here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chatting with reporters in his office, Leyland repeatedly was  
interrupted by a ringing phone. Former Marlins owner H. Wayne 
Huizenga also dropped by to talk. 
</P>
<P>
	Huizenga was vilified by many South Floridians for the  
dismantling that turned the Marlins from the World Series champions 
to the youngest team in baseball. Leyland remains loyal, even 
though he opted out of his contract after last season's 54-108 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love Wayne Huizenga. He treated me great,'' Leyland said.  
``The only thing is I wish we could cut the payroll a little bit 
and maybe have a better team. I'd have liked for us to have the 
chance to reap the benefits of winning the World Series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now Leyland returns with the Rockies, who have struggled as much  
as the team he left behind. Entering Friday night's game, Colorado 
had just seven more victories than the Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year's actually been a little tougher,'' Leyland said.  
``The expectations, rightfully so, were more than here. This club 
needs to be tinkered with, and it can be done. But we haven't 
played very well, to be honest with you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leyland remains bullish on the Marlins' future, particularly  
with all the highly touted pitching Dombrowski acquired in trades. 
If new owner John Henry can get a stadium built, he doesn't see why 
Marlins games can't be a happening as Rockies games are in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could be one of those things where if the stadium works  
out, it could have a great ending. Maybe I should say a great 
beginning,'' he said. ``By the time this team is ready to win, they 
could be moving into a new building.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not one with Leyland's rocker, though.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll probably put it on the plane when we go,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Pataki Backs Giuliani for Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In a move that could defuse a nasty primary  
fight, Gov. George Pataki endorsed Mayor Rudolph Giuliani for the 
Senate on Friday and asked Rep. Rick Lazio to defer his decision on 
whether to enter the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``In order to win, the Republican Party must be unified behind  
one strong candidate. I believe that Rudy Giuliani has earned the 
right to be that candidate,'' Pataki said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the expected Democratic nominee, first lady Hillary  
Rodham Clinton, met with the leader of the state's Independence 
Party to explore the possibility of getting its endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani, who has had a contentious relationship with the  
governor, was noticeably absent from Pataki's news conference. But 
he issued a statement saying, ``I very much appreciate Gov. George 
Pataki's strong words of support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A GOP primary fight between Giuliani and Lazio could deplete GOP  
funds and leave the winner vulnerable Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, a unified Republican Party could hurt Mrs. Clinton.  
The first lady, exploring a Senate bid, is not expected to have any 
opposition for the Democratic nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the Republicans do or don't do is up to them. Mrs.  
Clinton is going to continue focusing on issues and listening to 
New Yorkers,'' said Howard Wolfson, spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's 
exploratory committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani, who has not yet announced whether he will run, also  
got the endorsement Friday of former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato. Like 
Pataki, D'Amato also has been at odds with Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki's backing came in a brief statement in which he saved his  
most glowing words for Lazio. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rick Lazio is an outstanding congressman who is a rising star  
in our party. ... Rick Lazio would be a very strong candidate,'' 
Pataki said. ``Nevertheless, I have asked Congressman Lazio to 
defer his announcement and await the mayor's decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lazio, who could not immediately be reached for comment Friday,  
has said he would not run if Pataki asked him to bow out of the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he held any lingering resentment toward Giuliani, who  
had endorsed Mario Cuomo for governor over Pataki, the governor 
said, ``Obviously it was a disappointment, but you can't look 
backward. You have to look forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani is widely expected to run for the Senate, as is Mrs.  
Clinton who has been traveling the state in an effort to overcome 
the ``carpetbagger'' charge leveled against her. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaigning in Rochester, Mrs. Clinton said her planned  
summer-long ``listening tour'' of New York could extend well into 
the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	She called for a common standard for coverage of political  
candidates that does not invade their privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it serves our nation or our political process  
well for people to have every shred of privacy taken away from 
them,'' she said. ``I don't think that's good and I'm speaking as 
someone who's been through it, so I have some experience in that 
regard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton met privately for half an hour with Rochester  
businessman B. Thomas Golisano, leader of the Ross Perot-inspired 
Independence Party in New York. Golisano said they talked about the 
possibility of her securing its nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told her this is a process and that we're a long ways away  
from that point and encouraged her to keep the lines of 
communication open, and to be open and honest with us on issues so 
we can make a responsible decision,'' Golisano said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the Independence Party's backing of Democrat Charles  
Schumer was considered a factor in his victory over Republican 
incumbent Sen. Alfonse D'Amato. 
</P>
<P>
	At his news conference, Pataki was asked why he didn't endorse  
Giuliani earlier. ``I was waiting until the end of the legislative 
session, but I've thought for some time that this was the right 
decision,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he wanted to be sure his announcement came before  
Lazio's planned entry into the race the week of Aug. 16. ``I wanted 
to make sure my position was known to him and to the others within 
this state prior to his making that determination,'' Pataki said. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor told reporters that he spoke to both Giuliani and  
Lazio before making his announcement and that D'Amato was aware of 
his position. 
</P>
<P>
	``I agree with the governor's decision that Rudy Giuliani has  
earned the right to be our party's nominee,'' D'Amato said in a 
statement. ``I am certain that if he runs he will have my support 
and the overwhelming support of the Republican Party throughout the 
state. I urge the mayor to get into the race soon and unify the 
Republican Party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several Republican leaders, including state Senate Majority  
Leader Joseph Bruno and Staten Island Borough President Guy 
Molinari, had encouraged Lazio not to run against Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	``A bloody primary obviously would be very costly,'' Molinari  
said.

<HEADLINE> Smoke Detector Causes Daycare Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WELLSVILLE, Pa. (AP) -- How's this for a twist: A smoke detector  
apparently started a fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The detector, which was intentionally set off during a routine  
fire drill at a home day-care center, melted loose from its 
mounting and started a fire on the carpet Thursday while the 
center's occupants were outside practicing their drill, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The small, smoky blaze was quickly doused and no one was  
injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``The plastic smoke alarm is just a blob. It got that hot,''  
Fire Chief Michael L. Gasswint said. ``I have never heard of a 
smoke alarm causing a fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holly Sterner, who runs the center in her home, told Gasswint  
that she pushed a button to set off the detector. As part of the 
drill, she then evacuated the three children she was caring for, 
reminding them that they were supposed to meet outside at a light 
pole. 
</P>
<P>
	As the group re-entered a few minutes later, the alarm was still  
sounding and smoke was in the basement. Ms. Sterner quickly called 
911 and put out the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Damage was estimated at $1,000.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Sterner said she contacted the detector's manufacturer,  
which asked her to return the device so it can be checked. 
</P>
<P>
	That is routine procedure whenever a smoke detector is involved  
in an unusual event, said First Alert spokesman Robert Wheatley. He 
said it was highly unlikely that a battery-powered smoke detector 
could produce enough energy to start a fire. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is more likely that there is some other explanation for it,  
but I don't want to speculate as to what that would be,'' Wheatley 
said.

<HEADLINE> AOL Adds to Messenger Distribution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DULLES, Va. (AP) -- America Online Inc. will make its Instant  
Messenger service easily available to the 2.5 million customers of 
two smaller Internet access services, further defying Microsoft 
Corp.'s attempt to crack AOL's lock on the market for real-time 
notes. 
</P>
<P>
	The move Friday drew a sharp reaction from Microsoft, which is  
promoting its own instant messaging service but has been rebuffed 
so far in getting AOL to let customers of both services exchange 
messages. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too bad that AOL continues to advance their own separate  
efforts and is not listening to consumers' desires for 
interoperability between messenger services,'' Microsoft 
spokeswoman Deanna Sanford said. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL, based in Dulles, Va., announced Friday it would distribute  
its messaging service through MindSpring Enterprises and Earthlink 
Network, the first time its popular service has been available 
through another Internet service provider. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft attempted to gain  
access for its MSN customers to AOL's Instant Messenging users. But 
AOL built a digital firewall to keep MSN users out, citing security 
concerns. Microsoft is trying to work around the blockade. 
</P>
<P>
	By adding new users in Friday's deal, AOL creates an even more  
formidable presence in the budding market. AOL has 43 million users 
of its messaging service. Its deal with MindSpring and Earthlink 
will enable users to sign up for the service immediately upon going 
online, instead of clicking their way to AOL's site. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doing deals with other ISPs is a way of including other  
vendors in the market but keeping a hold on their control of 
Instant Messenging and ensuring that the AOL brand continues to 
dominate,'' said Mark Levitt, an analyst at the International Data 
Corp. research firm, in Framingham, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Instant messaging itself is not a money maker, Levitt said, but  
it is a way of attracting customers to other Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's capturing customers and making the customer spend time at  
the respective Microsoft or AOL sites,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL says it hopes to reach agreements with other small ISPs to  
include them in its instant messaging ``family'' and would be 
willing to include Microsoft, but only on AOL's terms.

<HEADLINE> Heart Disease, Stroke Deaths Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Although great progress has been made to reduce  
deaths from heart disease over the past 50 years, more steps are 
needed in the next century, the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention said. 
</P>
<P>
	Heart disease and stroke remain leading causes of disability and  
death, with estimated costs including lost productivity expected to 
be $286 billion in 1999, the CDC said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency said death rates from coronary and hypertensive heart  
disease and rheumatic heart disease have decreased from a peak of 
307.4 per 100,000 in 1950 to 134.6 in 1996, a decline of 56 
percent. Stroke deaths have decreased 70 percent in that time, from 
88.8 to 26.5. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop was attributed to factors including a reduction in  
cigarette smoking among adults (from 42 percent in 1965 to 25 
percent in 1995), an increase in medication for those with high 
blood pressure, improvements in medical care and diagnosis, and a 
greater awareness of proper diet as a preventive measure, such as 
lower fat and cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the CDC said the statistics masks differences in rates  
broken down by race, sex, economic status and geographic region. 
</P>
<P>
	During 1985-1996, for example, heart disease mortality declined  
29 percent among white men but only 10 percent among American 
Indian men and native Alaskan women. People of lower economic 
status have higher risk levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC said new challenges include reducing racial disparities,  
promoting policy and environmental strategies, determining the 
relation between genetics and disease and identifying new or 
emerging risk factors.

<HEADLINE> Sharpe Puts American Bowl in Focus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- All of a sudden, Shannon Sharpe is keen  
to play Down Under. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not that he'd like to show Australians his considerable  
talents as an NFL tight end. It's because he wants to get booed and 
jeered. 
</P>
<P>
	No John Elway meant no recognizable star for the American Bowl  
between Sharpe's Denver Broncos and the San Diego Chargers at the 
Olympic Stadium on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe was a godsend for promoters, playing the villain with a  
series of outbursts about how much he hated traveling and how he 
found Australians to be rude. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Sharpe, who is doubt for the game with an ankle injury,  
wants an expected crowd of 75,000 to show just how rude it can be. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't know yet if I'll play, but I'm really looking  
forward to the boos,'' Sharpe said. ``But then again, I don't 
really know if they know a whole lot about it, so I might run on 
the field and they might applaud me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's unlikely. In the past week, Sharpe has become a champion  
villain in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Talkback callers, unsure of what being a tight end quite means,  
have been inventing some interesting explanations. Sharpe has been 
panned by columnists and radio shock jocks alike, and game 
promoters are loving it. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego linebacker Junior Seau, who honeymooned in Australia  
seven years ago, has been trying his best to ingratiate the NFL 
players with the locals this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers have been training at the University of New South  
Wales, drawing large crowds of interested students. 
</P>
<P>
	Seau has done the public relations job with good humor and  
enthusiasm. When he met Australian footballers Wayne Carey and Brad 
Fittler this week, and donned their playing shirts, he whooped 
``Aussie Rules!'' so loudly it nearly knocked over the television 
cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope we don't get judged on one quote,'' Seau said.  
``Shannon Sharpe is an integral part of their team, and it's sad 
that he's not having a great time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone has a right to voice his opinion, but for the most  
part we have to look at what we say. Hopefully, we can try to put a 
little cap on it and enjoy the game, but right now that's the 
biggest thing that's going on here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``People that don't know me might say, `Yeah, he's giving  
himself a bad name.' But people that know me know that I speak my 
mind,'' Sharpe said. ``I don't bite my tongue. I say how I feel. 
And if you like it, you like it. I'm entitled to my opinion. That's 
one thing about America. We're entitled to opinions over there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sharpe controversy has overwhelmed football matters, but  
then this is an exhibition game, and the first of the season at 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	The most interest on the field centers on Bubby Brister's  
ascendancy to the Broncos quarterback position, the start of a duel 
between Chargers quarterbacks Jim Harbaugh and Erik Kramer, and 
Seau's attempt to play a little offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Brister, 4-0 as a starter for the Broncos last season, is  
confident he can help the team ease into life after Elway, and 
coach Mike Shanahan agrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of guys who have to step up, not just Bubby,''  
Shanahan said. ``Last year, he played well. Our players have a lot 
of confidence in Bubby that he'll get the job done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan said he did not know what to expect from the Chargers  
now that they have a new coach in Mike Riley and a couple of 
veteran quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan is anxious to see Seau on offense.  
</P>
<P>
	``I hope he plays a lot of offense,'' the Denver coach said,  
``so he gets tired out for his defense.''

<HEADLINE> Sweden Theater Leaders Step Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- In a collision of art and reality, two  
leaders of Sweden's national dramatic theater resigned Friday after 
an actor in a play about criminals was charged with killing two 
policemen. 
</P>
<P>
	Lars Noren and Isa Stenberg, the national theater's artistic  
director and chief producer, had been under pressure since late 
May, when the police officers were gunned down after a bank robbery 
in a small town. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the men charged in the killing was Tony Olsson, who  
appeared in a prison drama written by Noren and produced by Riks 
Drama, the national theater organization that puts on plays 
throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The twist: Olsson was not only an actor but a real-life convict,  
given permission to leave prison to appear in performances of the 
play. On the day of the robbery he was away from prison -- not to 
appear in the play but on a weekend leave, which are commonly given 
to prisoners in Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Olsson wasn't working on the play the day of the crime,  
his involvement increased already-strong criticism of the 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	Noren's play, called ``7:3'' after the section of the Swedish  
penal code that deals with escape-prone repeat offenders, was 
denounced by many because it included prisoners spewing neo-Nazi 
sentiments. Some critics said the play was simply racial hatred 
under the guise of art, and that using prisoners to play prisoners 
could be seen as legitimizing criminal tendencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Stenberg was criticized for allegedly breaking an agreement with  
prison authorities over how prisoners in plays would be 
transported. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid all that, the pressure became too much for Noren and  
Stenberg, they said in a joint statement Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We consider it our responsibility to leave,'' they said,  
because many people believe they have become a burden on the 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
	The killings shocked generally peaceful Sweden, where roughly 30  
policemen have been killed in the line of duty this century. 
</P>
<P>
	Olsson fled to Costa Rica after the shootings, but was arrested  
there and returned to Sweden. Two other men also have been arrested 
in the killings.

<HEADLINE> Kite Struggles To Reclaim Game  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAND BLANC, Mich. (AP) -- There was a time in Tom Kite's career  
when a sand wedge shot from 60 or 70 yards out that failed to stop 
within 6 feet of the flagstick ``was a major upset.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Kite, once regarded as the best in the game from 100  
yards in, has been having trouble putting his wedges within 20 
feet. And the declining confidence in this once unfailing aspect of 
his game has spread to other areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The death of longtime teacher and mentor Harvey Penick in 1995  
was a major loss for Kite. And his role as captain of the U.S. 
Ryder Cup team that lost to Europe in 1997 cut deeply into his own 
golf game. Kite bottomed out earlier this summer when he sat out 
for three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Kite of old seems to be re-emerging. In his first round  
Thursday at the Buick Open, Kite missed only two fairways and four 
times put his iron shots within that magic 6-foot barrier, 
including one of his patented sand wedges to within 3 feet on the 
first hole. It all added up to an opening-round 66, one shot off 
the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Kite's 66 Thursday put him a shot behind Brent Geiberger, whose  
bogey-free 65 put him in the lead alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just trying to piece together some sort of golf game that  
would allow me to compete,'' Kite said. ``The scores I've been 
shooting out here this year haven't been scaring anybody'' -- except 
Kite himself, that is. 
</P>
<P>
	His last PGA Tour victory came in 1993 when he won the Nissan  
Los Angeles Open. In 1998 he was unable to gain a top-10 finish for 
the first time in his 26-year career. This year, the slide 
continued as Kite missed eight cuts in his first nine tournaments, 
with only one round in the 60s. 
</P>
<P>
	The old techniques of working through a problem weren't working  
this time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kind of felt like one of those rats in a maze. You make so  
many turns, you obviously don't know where you are and just trying 
to get back to where you started is hard,'' Kite said. 
</P>
<P>
	Never having experienced a slump like this, Kite tried a new  
approach: putting down his clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	He stayed away from golf for almost three weeks. With the  
driving range being rebuilt at his home club in Austin, Texas, Kite 
set up a mat and netting in his garage. His teaching pro, Chuck 
Cook, was in England, so Kite set up a video camera and looked at 
his own swing. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever Kite did, something clicked. He made his return last  
week at Hartford and posted his best finish of the year -- tied for 
17th. On Thursday, his metronome swing was back in form. His round 
could have gone lower had relatively short putts on his final two 
holes fallen. 
</P>
<P>
	At 49, Kite is looking forward to playing on the Senior Tour  
next year and wants to join that elite group of golfers -- Jack 
Nicklaus, Hale Irwin, Ray Floyd among them -- who continued to 
contest for major championships into their late 40s and early 50s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really do think it's realistic,'' Kite said. ``I'm hitting  
the ball as far as I ever have.'' The key, he says, might be in his 
head rather than his swing and will require ``not dwelling too much 
on the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Tryba had six birdies, an eagle, a par and a bogey on the  
back nine for a 29, tying the tournament record for lowest 9-hole 
score at the 7,105-yard, par 72 Warwick Hills Golf and Country Club 
outside of Flint, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	Two dozen players were bunched within three shots of Geiberger,  
who won his first PGA Tour event last weekend. They included Tom 
Lehman and Bob Tway at 5-under and Ernie Els, Vijay Singh and Fred 
Funk in a large group at 4-under. 
</P>
<P>
	Spanish sensation Sergio Garcia, 19, shot a disappointing 73,  
including a double-bogey on the 401-yard 10th hole when he got 
stuck under a tree.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Borrowing Rises in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' rate of borrowing went up in June  
reflecting heavy credit card use, but the pace wasn't nearly as 
exuberant as it had been the month before. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers' credit outstanding, excluding mortgage debt, advanced  
at a 2.5 percent annual rate in June to a seasonally adjusted 
$1.347 trillion, the Federal Reserve said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	All told, consumers borrowed $2.8 billion more in June than  
during the month before, well below many analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in June's rate follows a hefty 10.5 percent gain in  
May -- the largest increase since January. In April, consumer 
borrowing rose 0.3 percent, less than the Fed previously estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	June's increase was led by demand for revolving credit --  
primarily credit cards revolving loans, which rose at an annual 
rate of 8.6 percent. That was the largest increase since a 9.3 
percent rise in January. In May revolving credit rose 4.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	However, demand for non-revolving loans actually fell 2 percent  
in June. That category includes loans for autos, mobile homes, 
boats, trailers, education and vacations. In May, non-revolving 
credit rose a sharp 15.3 percent, the biggest increase since 
January when it rose at an annual rate of 17.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	July's slowdown in consumer borrowing comes as Americans pulled  
back from their feverish spending pace in the second quarter of 
this year. In the April-June period, consumer spending rose 4.0 
percent compared to the torrid 6.7 percent increase in the first 
three months of the year.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Keeps Eligibility Requirements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The NCAA Division I board of directors  
decided Thursday there is ``no compelling reason'' to change 
Proposition 16 requirements on freshman eligibility pending a 
challenge in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, a federal judge said the NCAA bylaw dictating  
requirements for freshmen at the association's 302 Division I 
schools had an ``unjustified disparate impact on 
African-Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 3rd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Philadelphia granted  
the NCAA a stay, and arguments are scheduled to be heard on Sept. 
14. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our experience has been it does take awhile to argue these  
cases and a decision to be reached,'' said Graham Spanier, Penn 
State president and chairman of the Division I board. ``Because it 
is a live issue, we will be prepared to make any adjustments that 
are required of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Proposition 16 requires freshmen athletes have a high school  
diploma and a minimum grade-point average in 13 core academic 
courses with the GPA contingent on an indexed, sliding scale with a 
student's score on either the Scholastic Assessment Test or 
American College Test. Those scoring less than 820 on the SAT, or 
16 on the ACT, cannot participate, regardless of their other 
academic credentials. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question the board has been asking itself is whether there  
is any compelling reason to change that standard. We concluded 
there is not,'' Spanier said. ``We think we will prevail on the 
merits of the case. ... We believe standardized test scores do 
provide valuable information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the NCAA will continue to look at data.  
</P>
<P>
	``We do expect to fine-tune our legislation that relates to  
initial eligibility from time to time. ... Prop 16 may not be the 
last word as we hear new data,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spanier also said the board approved a package of  
recommendations by a basketball study group that would keep 
freshman eligibility but require all athletes to complete at least 
12 hours of study with at least a 2.0 grade-point average by the 
end of their first year in college. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals, announced several weeks ago, would also encourage  
all basketball players to attend summer school before the start of 
their freshman year and require that athletes be enrolled in at 
least six hours of study to keep financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals will be sent to the Division I management council  
for review and then back to the board for a final vote. Spanier 
said no action is likely before next summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are absolutely committed to academic integrity and to the  
joint concept of students and athletes,'' Spanier said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA also announced a matching grant of $250,000 to go to  
Division II schools and conferences to promote greater gender and 
ethnic representation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Division II was the only division with percentage decreases in  
African-American administrators and head coaches,'' said Arend 
Lubbers, president of Grand Valley State College and chairman of 
the Division II Presidents Council. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, this news is unacceptable. ... The matching grant  
program was developed to increase employment opportunities for 
women and minorities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA will take applications for the grants through next  
February, and those selected for the initial three-year program 
will be notified in May. The money will be distributed next summer.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Son Climbing Mount Rainier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a West Coast getaway described as ``under  
tight wraps,'' Vice President Al Gore spent this week climbing 
Mount Rainier with his 16-year-old son, White House officials said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials, members of Gore's staff, described the trip by  
Gore and Albert Gore III as so secret that even many senior staff 
and presidential campaign aides were not informed of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was held close, under tight wraps,'' said one official,  
speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president, who plans an aggressive presidential  
campaign schedule in September, dropped off the radar screen for 
most of his Washington staff Tuesday. He was not due to be back in 
business until Saturday morning, when he makes a speech in Chicago 
before meeting President Clinton for a joint fund-raiser in Little 
Rock, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard rumblings even from my own staff that the vice  
president may be climbing the mountain,'' John Krambrink, chief 
ranger at Mount Rainier National Park, told the Seattle 
Post-Intelligencer this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had the Secret Service contact us, and we've had the  
communications people contact us,'' Krambrink said. 
</P>
<P>
	An avid runner and hiker who completed the Marine Corps Marathon  
in 1997, Gore said last year he was eager to climb the 14,411-foot 
volcano this year. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of this month, the entire Gore family is scheduled  
for a beach vacation on the East Coast.

<HEADLINE> Knicks Get Wallace Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- John Wallace, a fan favorite with the Knicks  
during the 1996-97 season, rejoined the Eastern Conference 
champions Friday under a three-year contract worth $6.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't so much of a money issue coming back here, I wanted  
to be in position to win,'' said Wallace, who spent the past two 
seasons with the Toronto Raptors. ``It's a first-class 
organization, and I wanted to be back involved with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace was traded by the Knicks in the fall of 1997 in a  
three-way deal that brought Chris Dudley to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	He averaged 14.0 points and 4.5 rebounds during his first season  
in Toronto, then saw his playing time cut last season as he 
averaged 9.5 points and 3.6 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks had a need for another low-post player and a 3-point  
shooting specialist, yet they went after Wallace thinking he was 
the best all-around player left on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	``We said always in our free agent deliberations that it wasn't  
necessarily about position as it was about quality,'' player 
personnel director Ed Tapscott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jeff Van Gundy said three of the Knicks' top four free  
agent choices were in their mid to late-30s, with Wallace the 
exception. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks will use Wallace primarily as a backup small forward,  
with no promises of how much playing time he will get. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace said he's be happy to earn whatever minutes he could  
through hard work. He also sounded delighted to be returning to the 
team that drafted him 18th overall in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``Watching them on TV in the finals I hoped they would win, but  
I wished I was there at the same time,'' said Wallace, who signed 
under the $2 million middle-class exception.

<HEADLINE> Revelations in Purdue Player Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GARY, Ind. (AP) -- A man charged in a fiery crash that killed a  
Purdue women's basketball player was in court just hours before the 
collision, trying to plead guilty to alcohol-related misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Post-Tribune of Gary reported Friday that City Judge Pro Tem  
Itsia Rivera reversed Arnold Eaton's guilty plea and advised him to 
seek advice from a lawyer first. 
</P>
<P>
	Police records also show the 33-year-old Naval seaman had been  
arrested on at least two occasions before the crash that resulted 
in the death of 21-year-old Tiffany Young, who was buried in her 
home town of Hillsboro, Ala., on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Eaton faces eight years in prison if convicted on the felony  
charge of operating while intoxicated and causing a death. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said Eaton on Saturday ignored a red light and slammed  
into a car driven by Neil Sinclair, Young's boyfriend. Young died 
instantly, while Sinclair remains hospitalized with multiple 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier that day, Eaton was in court on charges stemming from an  
incident on April 20 resulting in misdemeanor charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``He initially pled guilty and didn't understand that it could  
mean his discharge from the military,'' City Judge Karen 
Freeman-Wilson said. ``When he was questioned, he was given the 
opportunity to change his plea so he could seek the assistance of 
counsel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman-Wilson said Rivera's action reflected an ordinary court  
action. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people don't seem to understand implications of their  
guilty plea, we'll do that,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eaton's prior arrest was in 1985, when he was 19, police records  
show. Charges in that incident were not available. 
</P>
<P>
	Without a lengthy criminal history, and no charge higher than a  
lower misdemeanor, ``there was nothing to make him stand out from 
anyone else in the courtroom,'' Freeman-Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The drunk and disorderly charge stemmed from an incident in  
April, when Eaton summoned police to his home to complain that his 
wife wouldn't let him have his car keys. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the arrest report, he ``appeared extremely  
intoxicated,'' and officers had to return to his home twice. He was 
charged with public intoxication and disorderly conduct. His first 
court appearance on the charge was July 31, and his trial was set 
for Nov. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Eaton, who has bonded out of jail, is scheduled to appear in  
court Aug. 18 on the felony charge of operating while intoxicated 
and causing a death.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: States Seeing Worst Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The current drought is the worst ever recorded  
for agriculture in four Northeastern states, and it threatens to 
cripple businesses and communities that depend on devastated farm 
economies, President Clinton said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Throughout much of this country, we have seen the worst  
drought since the Dust Bowl days,'' Clinton said today before 
leaving the White House for a weekend trip to Arkansas and 
Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	The drought is the worst ever for farmers in Maryland, Delaware,  
New Jersey and Rhode Island, the president said. Maryland and New 
Jersey have imposed state water restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Such a natural calamity can have devastating consequences, not  
only for farmers, but for small businesses and communities that 
depend upon a thriving agricultural sector; and for the electric 
power system so vital to our nation,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the government has worked hard to help  
drought-stricken farmers, but ``we must do more. It is our duty as 
a national community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Some parts of the country are in the grips of a drought of  
historic proportions,'' Deputy Commerce Secretary Robert L. Mallett 
said at a news briefing. 
</P>
<P>
	And these was little promise for relief.  
</P>
<P>
	Many parts of the East are eight to 18 inches below the normal  
rainfall over the last year and while the outlook is for a return 
to normal rainfall, that will not make up the deficit, said James 
Baker, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``This drought did not happen overnight ... and it will take a  
long time to be alleviated,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At another briefing today, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman  
said the drought has not affected commodity and consumer prices 
because it is not impacting the large growing regions of the 
Midwest and California. 
</P>
<P>
	But by being concentrated in the East, the dry period has been  
particularly hard on smaller farmers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House will convene a task force of affected federal  
agencies ``to coordinate our efforts and focus our attack on this 
problem,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also said he thinks Congress will come through with  
emergency farm money soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``There needs to be a special provision to deal with the drought  
crisis, and I hope ... and believe that there will be,'' Clinton 
said in response to a reporter's question about criticism of the 
administration's efforts so far. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish we could have done it before the August recess,''  
Clinton said, referring to a vacation break in Congress, ``But I 
think it will be there in time to aid the farmers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate approved $7.4 billion in emergency farm aid on  
Wednesday. The House will consider an emergency aid package after 
the recess.

<HEADLINE> SMU Uncovers Potential Violations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Southern Methodist announced late Friday it has  
uncovered potential recruiting irregularities in its football 
program, and responded by suspending an assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
	The university notified the NCAA, hired a Kansas City law firm  
and suspended assistant Steve Malin. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on the matters discovered, this issue appears to be  
narrow in scope and there is no evidence of booster involvement,'' 
according to a statement from the SMU athletics department. ``The 
university's actions are consistent with its ongoing commitment to 
NCAA rules compliance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NCAA spokesman Wally Renfro said he had no information about the  
violations and could not comment if he did. 
</P>
<P>
	Malin began his coaching career as an assistant at East Texas in  
1993, moving to a graduate assistant position at SMU in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	A defensive line coach, Malin is the longest-tenured member on  
the SMU football coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
	SMU, at one time a power in the now-defunct Southwest  
Conference, is the only school to receive the NCAA's so-called 
``death penalty,'' handed down for especially severe rules 
violations. SMU was barred from fielding a team in 1987, and 
decided to sit out the 1988 season as well because of restrictions 
placed on it by the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, SMU has struggled to become competitive, posting its  
only winning record (6-5) in 1997. Last year's team was 5-7.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Fewer Know Watergate Details </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most Americans think President Nixon's actions  
25 years ago in the Watergate scandal were serious enough to merit 
his resignation, according to a new Associated Press poll that also 
showed memories of the scandal are fading. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll, conducted by ICR of Media, Pa., found that more than  
60 percent said Nixon made the right decision when he became the 
only president to quit. But about a quarter of the people, and more 
than one-in-three Republicans, said the charges stemming from 
Watergate were not serious enough to merit his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	Baby boomers, those between 35 and 54 years old, were most  
likely to say the charges against Nixon were serious enough to 
drive him from office. They also were the generation most critical 
of the 37th president's policies concerning the war in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall numbers were about the same in a poll taken in the  
days after Nixon resigned, on Aug. 9, 1974, at the height of a 
scandal that dominated television news programs and newspaper front 
pages for months. In 1982, the number saying resignation was the 
right step reached about 75 percent and has eroded slowly. About 
half in the latest poll think President Clinton's actions were 
about as serious or worse, but he survived efforts to impeach him. 
</P>
<P>
	People's expectations for their leaders have changed since Nixon  
resigned, said Heather Rawlings, a 22-year-old student and human 
resources worker from Colorado Springs, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Politicians are seen as extremely corrupt today, while in the  
1970s they were seen as moderately corrupt,'' she said, noting 
political corruption is constantly reported in the media and is a 
frequent topic for comedians. 
</P>
<P>
	``People feel like: `They're corrupt, no biggie,''' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	But while opinions about Nixon have remained relatively stable  
over the years, the poll found that only four of every 10 people 
think they know enough about Watergate to tell others about it. Men 
were nearly twice as likely as women -- 52 percent to 28 percent -- 
to say they could recount the basic facts of the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may have to do with the stubbornness of men,'' said Dan  
Soulas, vice president of ICR. ``They don't want to admit they're 
not aware of something as newsworthy as Watergate was. It's purely 
a factor of their gender.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone survey of 1,012 adults was conducted July 28 to  
Aug. 1 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Other findings included:  
</P>
<P>
	--People were divided over whether Watergate was a serious matter  
that revealed corruption in the White House (48 percent) or was 
``just politics'' (45 percent). Although only 40 percent of 
Republicans said it was a serious matter, more than half of GOP 
voters said Nixon's resignation was warranted. 
</P>
<P>
	--One-third of the people surveyed said the allegations of  
misconduct against President Clinton over the Monica Lewinsky 
affair were about as serious as the charges made against Nixon, and 
18 percent said the Clinton matter was more serious. Forty-five 
percent said the Lewinsky case was less serious than Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
	--Three out of four people thought Nixon would be remembered more  
for Watergate than for his policies as president. The youngest 
adults, who learned about the scandal in school because they hadn't 
been born yet or were too young to remember when it happened, were 
the most likely to choose Watergate as his legacy (80 percent). 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Chatmon, a teacher from Monroe, N.C., said he thinks  
Clinton got off easily compared to Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Nixon and Clinton were in the same boat,'' he said.  
``Nixon went ahead and resigned. Clinton should have done the same 
thing. The only thing that saved Clinton was when people looked at 
what was going on -- the economy, the situation in the world -- and 
that saved him.''

<HEADLINE> Jobless Rate Steady at 4.3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's unemployment rate remained frozen  
in July at 4.3 percent, near a three-decade low, as manufacturing 
gained jobs for only the second time since early last year. And, 
wage pressures showed signs of intensifying. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported today that the July jobless rate  
matched the June number. Employers added a stronger-than-expected 
310,000 jobs to their payrolls. 
</P>
<P>
	The strength in hiring last month reflected big gains in demand  
for workers at temporary help agencies, which posted their 
strongest rise in 18 months. Hiring of workers also showed big 
gains at restaurants, computer companies and engineering firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturing managed to post a gain of 31,000 workers in July,  
after adjusting for seasonal variations, only the second increase 
in 16 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with last month's gain, employment in manufacturing is  
459,000 lower than in March 1998 as many industries continue to 
suffer from a global currency crisis that has cut into their 
exports and increased competition from cheaper-priced imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The 310,000 gain in payroll jobs for July far exceeded many  
analysts' expectations. They had been forecasting a gain of around 
230,000 added jobs, following an increase in June of 273,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets reacted negatively to today's report.  
Investors have grown increasingly nervous that tight labor markets 
will force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to keep 
inflation at bay. Prices in the bond market fell sharply, pushing 
the yield on Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond up to 6.10 percent 
in early trading compared to 6.04 percent late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tight labor market is finally starting to result in faster  
growth in wages and that's of concern to the Federal Reserve,'' 
said Paul Kasriel, senior economist with Northern Trust in Chicago. 
``This seals the fate for a quarter-point increase (in interest 
rates) when the Fed meets on Aug. 24.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The July increase in payrolls was well above the monthly average  
of the first six months of the year of 208,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department also reported today that average hourly  
earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures, increased by 3.8 
percent in July compared to a year ago, the second straight month 
that price pressures have risen. The 3.8 percent increase compared 
to 3.7 percent in June and was the biggest year-over-year gain 
since a 4 percent rise in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's report was the third report in a week showing an  
acceleration in wage pressures. On Thursday, the government said 
that unit labor costs rose at the fastest pace since the end of 
1997. And, last week the government said that the Employment Cost 
Index climbed at its most rapid pace in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress two weeks  
ago that the Fed would move ``promptly and forcefully'' to combat 
inflation generated from tight labor markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists expect Greenspan to carry through on that  
promise when Fed policy-makers next meet on Aug. 24 with another 
quarter-point increase in the federal funds rate, a benchmark rate 
that governs short-term borrowing costs for millions of consumers 
and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed on June 30 increased the funds rate to 5 percent, the  
first hike in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the strength of labor markets in July, the unemployment  
rate for blacks rose to 8.8 percent, up from a record low of 7.3 
percent in June. The unemployment rate for Hispanics, however, fell 
to 6.2 percent, down from 6.8 percent in June. And, the rate for 
teen-agers also dropped to 12.7 percent, down from 13.5 percent in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of strength in July came from gains in service industries  
led by the jump of 61,000 jobs at restaurants and bars, almost 
double the gain in June. Employment at temporary help agencies rose 
by 31,000 in July, the largest monthly gain in 18 months. 
Employment was also up at car dealerships, hardware and garden 
supply stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction added 22,000 jobs in July, but mining lost 3,000  
jobs as the oil and gas industry continued to suffer layoffs. This 
industry has lost one-fifth of its jobs, a total of 71,000 layoffs, 
since February of last year.

<HEADLINE> Aetna Buys Prudential Healthcare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Aetna Inc. completed its purchase of Prudential  
Health Care on Friday to become the nation's largest health 
maintenance organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was consummated when New Jersey on Friday became the  
last state to approve the merger. As several states have done, New 
Jersey forced Aetna to meet several conditions, including promising 
to keep 90 percent of Prudential's doctors for the next three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Medical Association and physician groups nationwide  
argued the merger would create a monopoly in several cities, 
severely limiting health insurance choices for consumers and 
forcing doctors to accept lower fees. 
</P>
<P>
	The combination of Aetna and Prudential Health Care will provide  
benefits to about 22 million people nationwide. Aetna currently 
provides health insurance to about 16 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna, which has previously bought HMO companies U.S. Healthcare  
and NYLCare, becomes the nation's largest HMO with 9.7 million 
members, surpassing Kaiser Permanente's 8.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Justice Department approved the Aetna-Prudential Health  
Care merger in June. The agency required Aetna to shed some of its 
HMO operations in Houston and Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement late Friday, the AMA said the approval was  
expected, but it was pleased about some of the conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The AMA continues to be concerned that such consolidation  
further tips the balance of power to insurance companies, giving 
them too much leverage in their dealings with patients and 
physicians,'' the group said. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Aetna officials denied rumors circulated on an  
Internet chat site that it plans to buy Oxford Health Plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We note the rumors in the marketplace that Aetna is planning  
to purchase Oxford Health Plans. These rumors are not true,'' Aetna 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna said its focus is on integrating Prudential into its  
operations. Oxford officials refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Oxford, a large Northeastern health maintenance  
organization, had risen as much as 8 percent to $17.62 1/2 amid rumors 
of a potential merger, before slipping back to $16.50, up 25 cents, 
on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna's stock closed down $2.43 3/4 to $81.56 1/4 on the New York  
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Norwalk, Conn.-based Oxford is expected to become profitable  
this year after accounting problems led to millions in losses the 
past two years.

<HEADLINE> Congress Faces Battles With Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Off for its summer recess, Congress will  
return to a September of confrontation with President Clinton as it 
tries to complete 11 spending bills for the fiscal year beginning 
Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers adjourned until Sept. 8 after granting final approval  
to only the second of the 13 annual spending bills, a $2.5 billion 
measure financing Congress' own operations. The House quit in the 
early hours today, while the Senate left Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Upon returning, they will have less than four weeks to sort  
through 11 bills financing scores of federal departments and 
agencies. The measures are loaded with provisions that will mean 
certain battles with Clinton, who wants more than $20 billion more 
than lawmakers have provided for schools, veterans, space and other 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress' departure came as House Majority Whip Tom DeLay,  
R-Texas, said GOP plans to leave Social Security surpluses alone 
this year have been shaken by Senate approval of $7.4 billion in 
emergency farm aid. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the atomic bomb that blows up the whole strategy,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLay said GOP leaders still intend to pass tax-cutting and  
spending bills that don't touch the billions in surpluses the 
massive pension program is accumulating. By the time Congress 
returns next month, top Republicans will decide how to do that and 
still move their own farm aid package through the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trent tried to hold off the mules and wagons, and he was  
rolled,'' Delay said, referring to Senate Majority Leader Trent 
Lott, R-Miss. ``And we'll get rolled over here if we try to stop 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeLay's remarks underlined the difficult time GOP leaders are  
having heeding their own pledge to leave Social Security surpluses 
undisturbed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Congressional Budget Office has estimated there will be a  
$14 billion budget surplus next year without counting Social 
Security's surplus. DeLay said it has been the GOP's intent ``from 
the get go'' to use that money for tax cuts and spending. 
</P>
<P>
	But so far, Republicans have committed $5.3 billion of it to  
their tax bill and $4.5 billion for next year's census; then there 
are the still undetermined costs of the farm aid bill, which could 
well grow to about the Senate's $7.4 billion figure. 
</P>
<P>
	That excludes the price tag for other emergencies that may  
occur. It also does not include money that Republicans want to use 
to shore up a huge spending bill for health and education that is 
currently about $15 billion below last year's levels. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLay said Clinton's expected veto of several of the 13 annual  
spending bills for 2000 would demonstrate to the public that it was 
he -- not Republicans -- who wants to use Social Security money for 
extra spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll just have to go to the American people and convince them  
it's important,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokeswoman Linda Ricci of the White House Office of Management  
countered, ``The Republicans went into this process without ever 
making the responsible choices it takes to produce a satisfactory 
budget that is paid for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House voted 217-210 on Thursday to approve a $37.7 billion  
measure financing the departments of Justice, Commerce and State 
for next year after refighting a familiar battle over U.S. abortion 
spending overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	By 221-206, the House rejected an effort by Rep. Tony Hall,  
D-Ohio, that would have allowed payment of $244 million of this 
country's U.N. back dues without linking them to limits on abortion 
funds. Conservatives would allow the payment of the dues only if 
U.S. funds were banned for groups that use their own money to lobby 
for liberalized overseas abortion laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate debated, but did not complete, a $14.1 billion  
measure financing the Interior Department and cultural programs. 
That measure has become a battleground over mining and other issues 
pitting industry against environmental concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	In a defeat for conservatives, the Senate rejected, 80-16, an  
effort by Sen. Bob Smith, I-N.H., to kill the National Endowment 
for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the House's Justice-Commerce-State bill and the Senate's  
Interior bill face veto threats from the Clinton administration 
because they provide less money for many programs than the White 
House favors. 
</P>
<P>
	The House approved the measure financing Congress by 367-49,  
while the Senate approved it by voice vote.

<HEADLINE> Closed Marine Base Is Fought Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL TORO MARINE CORPS AIR STATION, Calif. (AP) -- When the Marines  
left, war broke out in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents armed with petitions and ballot initiatives have  
challenged the county Board of Supervisors in what has become a 
bitter, costly battle over plans to build an international airport 
at the defunct air station. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight pits the county's wealthy residential communities in  
the south against its tourist-oriented north. Both sides have 
amassed multimillion-dollar war chests to influence the fate of the 
4,700-acre base. 
</P>
<P>
	Other California communities have been divided about what to do  
with closed military bases. Sacramento officials and residents have 
argued over the future of McClellan Air Force Base, due to close 
this year. San Francisco fought over the closed Presidio Army base, 
which will become part park and part commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
	But nowhere has the debate been more expensive or more strident  
than in Orange County, where board meetings routinely end in 
arguments and a war of words is waged daily in the opinion sections 
of local newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	Records indicate the two sides will spend about $35 million  
debating what to do with the base, which closed in July. The county 
expects to get the deed next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd bet nowhere else in the country do you have people  
throwing money like this behind an issue,'' said Ellen Cox Call, 
the county's airport spokeswoman. ``When the airport in Louisville, 
Ky., was expanded and 500 homes had to be moved, nobody fought 
against it like they are fighting it here. But here, you have 
people with a lot of money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A coalition of eight southern Orange County cities -- including  
Irvine, Laguna Beach and Mission Viejo -- leads the opposition. The 
group has set aside about $8 million, primarily to draw up 
alternative plans for the base and pay lawyers to fight for them. 
</P>
<P>
	Airport supporters, led by three of the five county supervisors,  
expect to spend about $27 million this year on airport studies and 
commercial planning. They say a second major airport for Orange 
County would create new jobs, increase tourism and lure businesses 
to the county, as well as bring a measure of independence from 
neighboring Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really about what's best for the county,'' Ms. Call  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Meg Waters, a spokeswoman for the cities opposing the  
airport plan, said most of the jobs created would be low-paying 
service jobs that would bring problems of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the most expensive housing markets in the  
country,'' she said. ``What we would end up with is a situation 
where people would have to commute from other communities because 
they can't afford to live here. Then, we end up with more traffic 
than we already have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group would rather see housing and commercial development. A  
San Clemente man even launched a petition drive to give residents 
the right to ban new toxic waste dumps, prisons and airports. 
</P>
<P>
	The initiative has the support of two Republican congressmen,  
Christopher Cox and Ron Packard. Cox wants the land to be sold to 
private developers so the federal government can recoup the costs 
of moving the Marines. Packard said an airport would change the 
largely residential area's character. 
</P>
<P>
	But airport opponents have an uphill battle. Orange County  
voters have approved building an airport at the base and rejected a 
referendum to overturn that decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The board of supervisors, which still must authorize the plan,  
is scheduled to vote next May. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to happen,'' Ms. Call said. She said the only  
question is whether lawsuits delay the airport's proposed opening 
in 2005.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Not Ready To Face Giuliani </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- With a possible Senate race against New  
York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani appearing increasingly likely, 
Hillary Rodham Clinton says she's not ready to start running 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not campaigning yet. They'll be plenty of time to talk  
about that. I want to talk about issues that people care about,'' 
the first lady said Friday to the applause of the more than 50 
people gathered for a discussion of school-to-work programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is eyeing the Senate seat from New York being  
vacated next year by fellow Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. The 
Republican mayor, stressing the fact that Mrs. Clinton has never 
lived or worked in New York, has his sights set on the same seat. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady's comment came just before New York Gov. George  
Pataki called on Giuliani to get into the Senate race and said Rep. 
Rick Lazio should shelve his plans to run for the seat. Pataki's 
move appeared aimed at short-circuiting a possibly expensive 
primary that could leave Republicans weakened for the battle 
against Mrs. Clinton, or at least at forcing Giuliani's hand on 
whether he will enter the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the Republicans do or don't do is up to them. Mrs.  
Clinton is going to continue focusing on issues and listening to 
New Yorkers,'' said Howard Wolfson, spokesman for the first lady's 
exploratory campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, during her stop in Rochester, Mrs. Clinton said her  
planned summer-long ``listening tour'' of New York could extend 
well into the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm having a really good time doing this and I intend to  
continue it for some time. There'll be different formats, different 
settings,'' she said, adding that she hoped she could ``continue it 
for the foreseeable future. At least those are my plans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about news reporting on Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the  
front-runner for the 2000 Republican presidential nomination, Mrs. 
Clinton urged a common standard for coverage of political 
candidates that would not invade their privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it serves our nation or our political process  
well for people to have every shred of their privacy taken away 
from them. I don't think that's good and I'm speaking as someone 
who's been through it, so I have some experience in that regard,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton was responding to recent criticism by some  
Democrats that presidential candidate Bush isn't being pressed as 
hard about his background as she and President Clinton have been. 
She refused to say if she felt there was a double standard at work. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Friday, Mrs. Clinton headlined a $500-a-person  
fund-raising reception at a Rochester hotel for Rep. Louise 
Slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	She also met for a half-hour with Rochester businessman B.  
Thomas Golisano, a leader of New York's Independence Party over 
what he said was the possibility the first lady would win the 
endorsement of the party along with the Democratic line on the 
November 2000 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told her this is a process and that we're a long ways away  
from that point and encouraged her to keep the lines of 
communication open and to be open and honest with us on issues so 
we can make a responsible decision,'' said Golisano. He was the 
1994 and 1998 gubernatorial candidate of the Independence Party, 
which was inspired by Ross Perot.

<HEADLINE> Anthrax Vaccine Costs Pentagon More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon has agreed to a doubling of the  
price it pays for a vaccine to inoculate U.S. troops against 
anthrax, a biological agent it considers to be a serious threat to 
U.S. forces. 
</P>
<P>
	The higher price will ensure that the vaccine supplier stays in  
business long enough to meet the Pentagon's needs, officials said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The only licensed producer of the vaccine, BioPort Corp. of  
Lansing, Mich., told the Defense Department in June that it could 
not stay in business under the price terms of its 1998 contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The matter is important to the Pentagon because in March 1998 it  
undertook to vaccinate all 2.4 million active-duty and reserve 
forces against anthrax, a naturally occurring bacteria found in 
domesticated animals; it can be produced as dry spores that, when 
inhaled, cause death within a few days. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon believes 10 countries have the capability to use  
anthrax as a biological weapon against U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
	So far 320,000 members of the military have taken the vaccine,  
and about 200 have refused out of fear that it could be harmful to 
their health, according to Pentagon estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to paying more per dose, the Pentagon has agreed to  
make a $18.7 million advance payment to BioPort to enable the 
financially troubled company to pay off creditors. The Pentagon has 
been granted a lien on BioPort assets and has the right to 
renegotiate the contracts terms after nine months. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon officials, speaking on condition they not be named,  
briefed reporters on a renegotiated contract that requires the 
Pentagon to pay BioPort $10.64 per dose, up from $4.36 per dose 
under the old deal. BioPort is now required to provide 5.3 million 
doses instead of 7.6 million, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The value of the new contract, through the year 2005, is $49.8  
million compared with the previous $25.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon officials said BioPort will make no profit on the  
vaccine sales but is given authority to sell as much as 300,000 
doses on the commercial market, so long as the Pentagon's needs are 
met first. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly Rossman-McKinney, a spokeswoman for BioPort, said the  
company is pleased with the new deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will give us the real shot in the arm we need to move  
forward,'' she said. BioPort will now have the flexibility to 
market its anthrax vaccine on the open market, including to 
friendly foreign governments. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon is attempting to overcome what it considers to be  
misinformation about the safety of the anthrax vaccine, which is 
licensed by the Food and Drug Administration and has been used for 
three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon officials acknowledged Thursday that temporary  
side-effects such as minor swelling and redness in the area of 
injection are more common among troops than was predicted at the 
outset of the vaccination program. But they said there has been no 
evidence so far of a link to any serious diseases.

<HEADLINE> Penske Shakes Up CART Teams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Al Unser Jr. is out and Gil de Ferran and Greg  
Moore, two of the circuit's hottest free agents, are in for the 
next three years on Roger Penske's CART Indy-car racing team. 
</P>
<P>
	Penske announced Friday that he and Unser, who joined the team  
in 1994, will part ways at the end of the season. De Ferran and 
Moore each have signed three-year contracts to begin driving for 
Penske in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're excited about this,'' Penske said shortly after  
provisional qualifying for the Grand Prix of Detroit on Belle Isle. 
``Both of these guys have been pursued by other teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De Ferran had left the island in the Detroit River by the time  
Penske made the announcement. But the Brazilian had been asked in 
an interview Thursday about the possibility of leaving Walker 
Racing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I feel fortunate there is some interest,'' De Ferran  
said. ``I don't think I'm in a position to make an announcement, 
but I'm not concerned for my future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De Ferran, 32, has earned poles at Japan and Toronto this  
season, and won the race at Portland. He heads into Sunday's race 
in seventh place in the driver standings. Since joining CART in 
1995, he has six poles and three victories. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, the 24-year-old Canadian who gained prominence with the  
Player's Forsythe team, won from the pole at the season-opener at 
Homestead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel bad for Al, but as a professional race car driver  
you've got to try to further your career however you can,'' Moore 
said in Indianapolis, where he drove in the season-ending IROC race 
Friday. ``It's difficult to leave a team that I've been with for 
five years, but on the other hand I think it's time for a change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore is eighth in the standings heading into Sunday's race.  
Moore has five poles and five victories in four years of CART 
racing. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're both at the very top of their games,'' Penske said.  
``They're certainly the type of drivers we'd like to have driving 
for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penske said the parting with Unser will be amicable. The two  
have had several talks about the situation this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Unser, who has 31 victories in 266 career starts, hasn't won in  
almost four years. In 10 races this season, his top finish is fifth 
at Cleveland. In his last start, he completed 206 of 250 laps 
before retiring with engine problems at Michigan Speedway, 
finishing 13th in the U.S. 500. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had great success with Marlboro Team Penske,'' Unser  
said. ``It really wasn't that hard of a decision, because Roger is 
a friend of mine and supports me. This is another corner we're 
taking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unser won CART driving titles in 1990 and 1994, but things have  
gone downhill since a brilliant 1994 season, his first with Penske, 
when he won a career-best eight races to match the season record 
set by Mario Andretti in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Unser finished second in the series championship in 1995 when he  
had four victories. But he hasn't won a CART race since Vancouver 
in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Known as ``Little Al,'' he is part of racing's fastest family.  
His father, Al, is a two-time series champion and four-time 
Indianapolis 500 winner. His uncle, Bobby, is a three-time Indy 
winner and two-time series runnerup. 
</P>
<P>
	Unser injured his right ankle and left knee March 21 in the  
season opener at Homestead and missed the next two races. He stands 
17th in the points race entering Sunday's race.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Women's Soccer Team Wins Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Finally, the focus was back on the  
competition at the Pan American Games. 
</P>
<P>
	It was on the soccer field, where the U.S. women -- no, not that  
team, but the under-18 national squad -- won a gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	It was on the courts, tennis and basketball, where American Paul  
Goldstein won a gold medal and the U.S. women fell short again vs. 
Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	It was in the boxing ring, with two Americans getting to the  
finals. 
</P>
<P>
	And it was in the pool, where America's women got on track with  
two games records. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our spirit this meet has been tremendous, no matter how many  
medals we've gotten,'' Staciana Stitts, 17, of Carlsbad, Calif., 
said after leading a 1-2 U.S. finish in the 100-meter breaststroke 
with a Pan Ams record 1:09.16. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're strong now. People can say we've been disappointing  
because we're not winning gold, but we're swimming our best 
times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stitts also is strong ... mentally.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite being diagnosed with alopecia, which caused her hair to  
fall out when she was 12, Stitts has a bubbly, refreshing attitude. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's awesome,'' she said when asked about her disease, the  
cause of which is unknown. ``I'm so glad I'm in swimming. I don't 
know where I'd be without it. The sport is a big ego-booster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karen Campbell, 22, a black belt in taekwondo, gave the U.S.  
women a second gold medal, winning the 100 butterfly at 1:00.15, 
after setting a games record of 59.70 in the preliminaries. Prior 
to Thursday night, the Americans had only one gold in eight women's 
events. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my first major breakthrough,'' said Campbell, of  
Kalamazoo, Mich., and a fifth-year senior at Southern California. 
``Breaking one minute is a huge success for me. 
</P>
<P>
	``Taekwondo has helped me to focus in swimming, be disciplined  
and overcome the threshold of pain in training. Taekwondo was 
easier. I trained three times a week. In swimming, I train twice a 
day for three hours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's men increased its swimming gold-medal total to five by  
winning two races Thursday night. The Brazilians capped the 
competition by winning the 400 freestyle relay with a games record 
3:17.18, after Luiz Lima took the 400 freestyle in 3:52.25. 
</P>
<P>
	The other gold went to Canada's Morgan Knabe in the men's 200  
breaststroke at 2:14.73, another Pan Ams record. 
</P>
<P>
	Catherine Reddick made an uncanny series of moves to score the  
lone goal as the United States beat Mexico 1-0 for the soccer gold. 
Goalie Hope Solo, who plays at the University of Washington, had 11 
stops. Her fully extended block of a shot by Iris Mora in the 53rd 
minute and her diving save on a shot in the penalty area by Fatima 
Leyva in the 87th preserved the win. 
</P>
<P>
	They don't want to be confused with the U.S. team that won the  
World Cup last month. They just wanted to emulate them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had our own expectations, because we are a different  
team,'' Solo said. ``We are not the USA team, not the World Cup 
team. So we had to establish our own expectations and distinguish 
ourselves. And it wasn't just because they won. 
</P>
<P>
	``But they intrigued us and they inspired us.''  
</P>
<P>
	Goldstein put on an inspired display in tennis, beating  
top-seeded countryman Cecil Mamiit 4-6, 6-0, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was easier, because we knew we had gold and silver  
wrapped up, so that took the burden off,'' Goldstein said. 
``Anytime you play a friend, especially someone you play every day, 
literally, you have no tricks up your sleeve. Hopefully we were 
good representatives of our country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maria Vento of Venezuela beat Tara Snyder of Houston 6-4, 6-0  
for the women's crown. Vento beat all three Americans in women's 
singles. 
</P>
<P>
	``To win the Pan American Games for my country is very  
importanta,'' Vento said. ``There were some great players in this 
tournament, especially the American team that was so strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American women's basketball team wasn't strong enough for  
Cuba. It made things much closer, falling 87-78 in the semifinals 
after a 95-64 defeat in the preliminary round. They'll play Brazil 
for the bronze, while Cuba takes on Canada for the gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Two American boxers won and three lost in the semifinals.  
</P>
<P>
	Super heavyweight Davin King moved into the final against Cuba's  
Alexis Rubalcaba by shutting out Argentina's Manuel Azar 4-0. Jose 
Navarro of Los Angeles won his flyweight bout when he outpointed 
Daniel Ponce of Mexico 12-8. 
</P>
<P>
	Featherweight Aaron Torres lost a defensive match with Zayas  
Younan of Canada 2-1. Light welterweight Corey Bernard was beaten 
10-4 by Kleson Pinto of Brazil. Darnell Wilson lost 9-8 to Cuban 
star Jorge Gutierrez, who scored a winning punch in the final 20 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Hidalberto Aranda of Cuba set the world record in the clean and  
jerk for the 77 kilogram division. Aranda lifted 205.5 kilograms 
(453 pounds) to break the record of 205.0 (452 pounds) set by 
Armenian Khachatur Kyapanaktsyan on Jan. 1, 1998 in La Coruna, 
Spain. Aranda won the gold.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Gains Against the Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar was mixed Friday, gaining against the  
Japanese yen and holding steady against the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar also was quoted at 114.73  
yen, up from 114.30 yen at the same point on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at $1.0756, unchanged from late Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	The dollar drew some early pressure from a report showing more  
signs of inflationary pressures that may prompt the Federal Reserve 
to slow the economy with another boost in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The government reported that the U.S. unemployment rate held at  
4.3 percent in July, near a three-decade low, as employers added a 
stronger-than-expected 310,000 jobs to their payrolls. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the continued strength of the job market, wage pressures  
intensified. Average hourly earnings, a major component of a 
product's price, rose 3.8 percent in July compared to a year ago, 
the second straight month that price pressures have risen. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Friday, the dollar also was quoted at 1.4883  
Swiss francs, up from 1.4878 a day earlier, and 1.5039 Canadian 
dollars, up from 1.4962 on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The British pound fell to $1.6108, down from late Thursday's  
quote of $1.6129. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Friday's euro rate, the dollar held steady at 1.8185  
German marks, 6.0976 French francs, and 1798.56 Italian lire.

<HEADLINE> Disabled Swimmers Have Right Stuff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VENTNOR, N.J. (AP) -- They left their crutches, wheelchairs,  
braces and fake limbs on the dock. Once they started swimming, the 
disabilities seemed to just wash away. 
</P>
<P>
	A girl with one arm cruised through the back bay, swinging her  
left arm up and out of the water and then back into it, sinking 
under the surface ever so slightly in between strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Wening, 24, of Ann Arbor, Mich., who was born with no  
ankles or feet, swam a 3-mile race in less than 57 minutes, a pace 
so quick he threatened to leave his kayaking escort in his wake. 
</P>
<P>
	So it went Friday at the third annual Disabled Invitational Open  
Water Championship Swim, a competitive event that attracted 
athletes from all over the Midwest and Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	The event, which is one of a slew of swimming events scheduled  
this weekend at the shore, is the only open-water swim for disabled 
athletes that is sanctioned by USA Swimming Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsored by Bacharach Rehabilitation Hospital and the Egg  
Harbor Township Seahawks swimming club, it is less well-known than 
the Around the Island Swim and the U.S. Lifeguard Championships, 
but no less compelling to watch. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they get into the water, you can't even tell they're  
handicapped -- or how,'' said David Cherry of Margate, who drove a 
boat for officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The event has become a natural side attraction to the Around the  
Island Swim, a 22.5-mile event that attracts the world's top 
marathon swimmers and sanctioning body officials to Absecon Island. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're trying to do is mainstream swimmers with  
disabilities so they have the same opportunities to compete as 
able-bodied swimmers,'' said Jack Gillen, a USA Swimming official 
on hand for the event. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a really good opportunity,'' said Lindsay Moesch, 19, of  
Chicago, lowering herself from a wheelchair onto the dock before 
the start of a 1 1/2-mile race. ``There's not much publicity and a lot 
of people in my position don't know they have the opportunity to do 
this. 
</P>
<P>
	Moesch, who has spina bifida, has almost no use of her legs. She  
loves to swim, but had never competed in an open water -- or outdoor 
-- event before. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just being in salt water is a big thing for me. I'd never seen  
an ocean until yesterday. But the salt water is kind of gross,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chelsea Mascaro, 9, of Hatfield, Pa., also a spina bifida  
sufferer who needs a wheelchair, was among the other competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't really use my legs, but I can use my arms. I have very  
strong muscles,'' she crowed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Around the Island Swim, which began in 1953 as a bet between  
two lifeguards to see who could circumnavigate Absecon Island 
faster, is scheduled for Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five marathon swimmers -- only five of them from the  
United States -- will battle rough surf, changing tides and 
jellyfish in the event, which is part of the 12-race FINA World Cup 
Circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The swimmers grease up their bodies with Vaseline or oil and  
swim a race divided between the rough open ocean and the calmer 
back bays. It is a major spectator event for bayfront property 
owners, who decorate their homes and hold parties to celebrate and 
watch it. 
</P>
<P>
	Lifeguards, two per boat, row alongside each swimmer to provide  
food, drink, direction and information. 
</P>
<P>
	Also this weekend, the 1999 U.S. Lifesaving Association National  
Lifeguard Championships are at Cape May. About 2,000 lifeguards 
nationwide will compete in surf boat rowing, swimming, rescue 
boating and running events.

<HEADLINE> Drug-Resistant Bacteria on Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The bacteria that cause pneumonia, meningitis and  
other serious illnesses are becoming increasingly resistant to 
penicillin, federal health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of cases of streptococcus pneumoniae bacterium that  
proved resistant to antibiotics increased from 14 percent in 
1993-94 to 25 percent in 1997, the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the study did not address the reason for the increase,  
Dr. Daniel Feikin of the CDC said one of the leading factors is 
overuse. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of infections are viral and antibiotics don't do  
anything for viral infections,'' he said. ``So when people go in 
with a viral infection like a cold they come out with an antibiotic 
when they shouldn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The data came from a CDC study of hospitals in seven states. The  
prevalence of drug-resistant pneumonia varied from 15.3 percent in 
Maryland to 38.3 percent in Tennessee. Other states included in the 
study were California, Oregon, Connecticut, Minnesota and Georgia.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Move Higher; Dow Up 15.51 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose moderately in early trading today  
although the government's employment report showed an unexpected 
rise in job growth and wages and confirmed to many investors that 
the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates soon. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 15.51 at 10,809.33, adding to the Dow's 119-point gain on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed.  
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 0.07 at 1,313.64. The  
Nasdaq composite index, however, benefited from gains in technology 
stocks and was up 15.69 at 2,581.52. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks initially fell after the Labor Department reported that  
employers added a larger-than-expected 310,000 jobs to their 
payrolls and that average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation 
pressures, increased by 3.8 percent in July compared to a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors have grown increasingly worried that tight labor  
markets will force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates as a 
pre-emptive strike against inflation. Higher interest rates cut 
into corporate profits by raising the cost of borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Fed needed fuel to consider raising rates, they have it  
now with these new numbers,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior vice 
president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. ``The strong jobs report tilted the 
optimists upside down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department also reported the unemployment rate  
remained at 4.3 percent in July, near a three-decade low. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices in the bond market fell sharply on the report, pushing  
the yield on Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond up to 6.11 percent 
in early trading compared to 6.04 percent late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the decline in trading today was short-lived. Almost  
immediately, bargain hunters came into the market, looking for 
cheap deals on stocks. The Dow is down more than 4 percent from its 
record high reached last month, while the Nasdaq composite is off 
11 percent from its all-time high. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough to call all the turns in this market,'' Ackerman  
said. ``It is like the Indianapolis 500. Everything keeps changing 
lap after lap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 13-to-7 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 83.44 million 
shares, down from Thursday's early pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 0.43 at 616.96, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was up 1.04 at 777.13.. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.57 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 1.02 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.4 percent, and France's CAC-40 was 
down 0.02 percent.

<HEADLINE> Kokusai, Deutsche Bank To Ally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's Kokusai Securities Co. and Germany's  
Deutsche Bank AG are concluding an agreement for a joint venture 
asset management company in Europe, the companies said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The venture, which would be 60 percent owned by the Japanese  
securities firm, will aim to manage investment trusts for Japanese 
clients. Deutsche Bank would own the remaining 40 percent of the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	The joint venture will be able to take advantage of Kokusai's  
Japanese client base in Europe and Deutsche Bank's investment 
expertise, Kokusai said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company's name and capitalization have not yet been  
decided. 
</P>
<P>
	Kokusai said it hopes to launch the asset management firm on  
Oct. 1 with about 20 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The joint venture's president will be appointed from Kokusai,  
while its chairman and chief investment officer likely will come 
from Deutsche Bank, Kokusai said. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Bank has another joint venture asset management company  
with Nippon Life Insurance Co., Japan's largest life insurer. 
</P>
<P>
	Kokusai and Deutsche Bank have been jointly developing  
investment trusts for the Japanese market. Kokusai is affiliated 
with Japan's largest securities house, Nomura Securities Co.

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs Anti-Cybersquatting Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate passed a bill Thursday night that  
would limit ``cybersquatting,'' a practice in which people register 
Internet domain names so they can later sell them. 
</P>
<P>
	The unanimous voice vote sent the bill to the House.  
</P>
<P>
	Domain names are the addresses computer users enter to access a  
particular Web site. They are sandwiched between ``www.'' and 
``.com,'' ``.net'' or ``.org.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some people have found a lucrative practice in registering Web  
addresses using the trademarks of famous companies in hopes of 
later forcing the companies to pay sizable amounts of money to buy 
the rights to the Internet locations. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would allow trademark owners to recover statutory  
damages in cases where it is proven that a trademarked name was 
registered in bad faith by a person who intended to unfairly profit 
from its sale. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure also would allow trademark owners to seek the  
forfeiture, cancelation or transfer of an infringing domain name 
after satisfying the court that it has tried but was unable to 
locate the person who registered it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration opposes the measure, contending that  
courts are already capable of dealing with the situation and that 
``it would be better to allow courts to continue to develop a body 
of case law in this area.''

<HEADLINE> Gore, Son Tackle Mount Rainier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARADISE, Wash. (AP) -- The secrecy shrouding Vice President Al  
Gore's vacation was almost as thick as the fog on Mount Rainier, 
the 14,411-foot peak that rises southeast of Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	But by the time the weary but triumphant vice president and his  
16-year-old son, Albert Gore III, walked out of the mountain fog 
Friday night, the secret was out -- the pair had made it to 
Rainier's snow-covered summit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was great,'' Gore said, giving a thumbs-up as he trudged  
down wearing a rigid frame backpack fastened with his bedroll and 
red climber's helmet. 
</P>
<P>
	He shook hands among the crowd of about two dozen waiting for  
him at the Paradise visitor's center before he and his son were 
whisked away by Secret Service vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gores braved weather that had deterred other climbers,  
including rain and some hail. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's staff had described the climbing vacation as so secret  
that many of his senior aides were unaware of it. Gore and his son 
have been running and lifting weights together at home for months. 
All along, the vice president's line was that he was training for 
another marathon. 
</P>
<P>
	An online tour guide to Mount Rainier, an active volcano, warns  
that half of the 10,000 men and women who attempt to climb never 
make it -- turned back by weather or exhaustion. Reaching the peak 
requires a vertical climb of more than 9,000 feet over eight miles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Climbers must be in good physical condition and well  
prepared,'' warns the guide. ``Proper physical conditioning can 
offset the effects of fatigue that lead to mistakes or injuries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore slipped off the official radar screen for most of his staff  
on Tuesday, leaving word only that he would catch up with his aides 
in Chicago Saturday morning for a speech to Jesse Jackson's 
Rainbow/PUSH Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	One official said the vice president wanted some solo time with  
his son before this fall, when the 2000 campaign kicks into high 
gear. Gore plans to campaign away from home for about 20 days in 
September.

<HEADLINE> Report on HUD Official Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional investigators have found  
inaccuracies in a report that accused a Department of Housing and 
Urban Development official of impeding a probe of alleged racism in 
her office. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Accounting Office listed 11 inaccuracies in the  
41-page report, ranging from incorrect dates and statistics to a 
flawed explanation of why the department redirected an 
investigation of housing fraud away from three cities with black 
mayors. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO's findings prompted Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., to ask  
Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo to check the accuracy of the report, 
which was submitted in December 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond asked Cuomo to closely review the report's credibility  
because the errors create the overall impression that Inspector 
General Susan Gaffney may be unfit to perform her job -- ferreting 
out waste and mismanagement at the department. 
</P>
<P>
	A HUD spokesman said the GAO's findings do not challenge the  
report's conclusions. ``In fact, by finding at most only 11 small 
inaccuracies, the GAO letter validates the vast majority of the ... 
lengthly report and confirms that it is a reliable document for HUD 
and Congress to use,'' spokesman David Egner said. 
</P>
<P>
	An apparent feud between Gaffney and top housing officials  
spilled into the public in March, when Deputy Secretary Saul 
Ramirez told a Senate subcommittee she had taken a ``destructive, 
attack approach'' to the department, which has been working hard to 
correct longstanding management problems. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, Gaffney called Cuomo a ``very ambitious man'' who  
saw her as an obstacle to his political future rather than an 
investigator seeking to repair the department's reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter sent Thursday, Bond asked Cuomo to ``conduct a  
careful and detailed examination of the facts and law underlying'' 
the report and consider demanding all or part of the $50,000 the 
government paid a law firm to produce it. 
</P>
<P>
	The report had called Gaffney's responses to allegations of  
discrimination ``petty, nitpicking arguments based upon 
misrepresentations, distortions of events, remarks taken out of 
context and arguments that defy logic and reason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report, submitted by attorney Donald Bucklin of Squire,  
Sanders &AMP; Dempsey, went on to say that Gaffney's ``efforts can only 
be viewed as intended to impede the investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his report, Bucklin examined HUD's handling of a complaint by  
Philip X. Newsome, a black employee who had been passed over for 
the job of assistant inspector general in December 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsome filed a complaint in February 1998, alleging that  
Gaffney and senior members of her staff had engaged in a pattern of 
racial discrimination, including the use of ``racially and 
ethnically derogatory names and remarks,'' Bucklin said. Newsome 
had been serving as acting assistant inspector general since July 
1997 but was not chosen to take the job permanently. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bucklin report also said Gaffney's office at first did not  
use ``traditional, objective'' selection criteria when it chose 
three cities led by black mayors -- Baltimore, New Orleans and San 
Francisco -- in early 1998 to launch new audits of housing programs 
to uncover possible criminal wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	When the office took another look at the project using objective  
criteria, the Bucklin report said, ``the target changed 
dramatically and no longer focused on cities with African-American 
mayors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the GAO said the FBI and the Justice Department worked  
hand-in-hand with Gaffney's office to develop the selection 
criteria that eventually led to the selection of the three cities.

<HEADLINE> Unilever's 2nd-Quarter Profits Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROTTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Consumer products maker Unilever  
said Friday its second-quarter profits rose 11 percent on strong 
performances in Asia Pacific, North American, African and Mideast 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Anglo-Dutch firm whose diverse products include Calvin Klein  
fragrances, Wisk laundry detergents and Lipton tea reported that 
its profits before one-time items totaled $809 million, up from 
$729 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	When one-time items are included, net profits totaled $759  
million, up 3 percent from $735 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose 3.6 percent to $11.85 billion from $11.45 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Sales of Unilever products grew across most of Europe, but  
Russia's ongoing economic difficulties kept sales growth flat for 
Europe as a whole, the company said. Sales growth also was held 
back in Latin America by the region's economic slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Unilever said that for the remainder of the year some  
acceleration of economic growth in western Europe may be offset by 
slower growth in North America. The recovery in East Asia may be 
offset by continuing difficulties in Latin America and Eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first half, profits before one-time items are included  
totaled $1.55 billion, up from $1.43 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	When one-time items are included, net profits totaled $1.47  
billion, up from $1.44 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose to $22.63 billion from $22.38 billion.

<HEADLINE> Hastert Backs Right To Sue HMOs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trying to hold his fractured party together,  
House Speaker Dennis Hastert said today that he will bring an HMO 
bill to the floor that includes new rights to sue managed care 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the first time a Republican congressional leader has backed  
an expanded right to sue -- something Democrats have been insisting 
on since the managed care debate began more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert, R-Ill., promised a floor vote in September on a  
proposal being developed by Reps. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., and John 
Shadegg, R-Ariz. It will also include the right to take disputes to 
an independent panel, the right to choose doctors outside a network 
and easier access to gynecologists, obstetricians and 
pediatricians. 
</P>
<P>
	Most significantly, it will include new rights to sue -- the  
first time that GOP leaders have backed such a provision. ``HMOs 
can be taken to court and held accountable when patients are 
harmed,'' Hastert said, describing the provision. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the most important issues facing the Congress this year  
involves the health care delivery system,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The move comes a day after a group of some 20 Republicans, led  
by Rep. Charles Norwood, R-Ga., signed on with minority Democrats 
to back HMO legislation. GOP leaders had been trying to come up 
with a bill that could pass the House for weeks now, and they met 
until 2 a.m. today looking for a way to avoid losing a floor vote 
to the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said Coburn and Shadegg told Hastert that they would join  
with Norwood and other Republicans unless Republicans could come up 
with a strong alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's significant is the leadership of the House has for the  
first time recognized that the will of the majority supports giving 
people the right to sue their HMO,'' said John Hart, a spokesman 
for Coburn. 
</P>
<P>
	But there were few details of their provision available today,  
and aides said they needed the upcoming August recess to work them 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	The bipartisan bill, which was formally introduced today, would  
establish an outside review process for patients who believe they 
unfairly were denied care. Companies obeying an independent panel's 
ruling still could be sued in state courts, but would not be liable 
for punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	It also includes a variety of provisions to ease access for the  
insured to medical care in emergency rooms, from specialists in 
clinical trials and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill was embraced immediately Thursday by President Clinton  
and decried by insurance companies and businesses, who have lobbied 
against new rules for health maintenance organizations and other 
managed care plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans hold a narrow majority in the House, and they have  
been unable to craft a bill that could win majority support. Their 
task will be even tougher now that some Republicans have joined 
with Democrats, who have been pushing for stronger provisions than 
most in the GOP support. 
</P>
<P>
	The point man for Democrats during negotiations that led to  
Thursday's announcement, Rep. John Dingell of Michigan, said the 
legislation ``covers everyone. You can appeal if you are denied 
treatment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton called on Hastert to schedule a vote.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is time to do what this bipartisan coalition has done -- put  
the well-being of patients before politics and special interests,'' 
Clinton said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was put together by Norwood, who has shuttled between  
Republicans and Democrats in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need a law that will protect patients, not a bill that will  
protect politicians at the November ballot box,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Norwood, a dentist, is one of several Republicans who are health  
professionals and have been at odds with their party's leadership 
on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	As news of the deal spread, lobbyists for insurance companies  
and businesses mobilized against the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	``This legislation is built on the erroneous premise that trial  
lawyers are the sole guardians of medical care,'' said Karen 
Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health Plans, an 
HMO trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	Given their slim majority in the House, Republican leaders had  
been hoping to keep the HMO issue off the floor until they had 
worked out differences among the GOP rank-and-file. 
</P>
<P>
	The bipartisan agreement is a setback for that strategy, and the  
leadership will come under increased pressure to allow the issue to 
the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican-controlled Senate passed HMO legislation earlier  
this year that is significantly more restrictive than Democrats and 
the White House favors. It covers only some of the nation's 
insured, for example, and does not permit HMOs to be sued for 
denying care. 
</P>
<P>
	Dingell, Norwood and others stressed that their measure would  
cover all those who have insurance.

<HEADLINE> F-1's Schumacher Needs Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MODELLO, Italy (AP) -- Michael Schumacher needs an operation on  
his broken leg, Ferrari said Friday, and ruled out any chance the 
driver would return to racing in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came following an examination by doctors at a  
Geneva hospital, and dashed Schumacher's hopes of returning to 
practice as soon as Saturday, with an eye toward the Hungarian 
Grand Prix in mid-August. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher's right leg was fractured in two places when his car  
crash into a tire wall at the British Grand Prix on July 11. 
</P>
<P>
	``The clinical evaluation is very good at this time, but it is  
too early for him to return in an F1 car in the coming weeks,'' 
Ferrari said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferrari said rehabilitation would start the day after Schumacher  
has his operation, which it said might allow him to make his 
comeback at Monza on Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	No date was determined for the surgery.

<HEADLINE> Swedish Opposition Leader Steps Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Carl Bildt, the leading figure of  
Sweden's non-socialist opposition, announced Friday that he is 
stepping down as head of the Moderates Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Bildt's resignation had been widely expected since he failed in  
last year's elections to return as prime minister, a post he held 
from 1991-94. 
</P>
<P>
	After the defeat, many believed Bildt would turn his ambitions  
back toward the international political scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Bildt is widely admired in Sweden for his 1995-97 work as the  
top international civilian official in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In May, 
he was named one of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's two envoys 
for Kosovo, although his work in that role has been overshadowed 
both by Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari's peace negotiating 
efforts and by the U.N. administrators in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The 50-year-old Bildt declined to say what work he might take up  
when his party leadership ends. ``The future is open,'' he said at 
a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have come to the point in time when it is best to do what  
sooner or later must be done,'' he said, adding that he believed he 
was stepping down at a time when the opposition was strong. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Bildt's conservative party gained seats in the Riksdag  
parliament at the expense of the governing Social Democrats, the 
incumbent government stayed in power under an awkward agreement 
with the Green and Left parties. 
</P>
<P>
	The Moderates are to meet next month to choose a new chairman,  
but there is no clear successor to Bildt.

	Jobless Rate Steady at 4.3 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's unemployment rate remained frozen  
in July at 4.3 percent, near a three-decade low, as manufacturing 
gained jobs for only the second time since early last year. The 
Labor Department reported today that the July jobless rate matched 
the June number as employers added a stronger-than-expected 310,000 
jobs to their payrolls. The strength in hiring reflected big gains 
in demand for workers at temporary help agencies, which posted 
their strongest rise in 18 months. Hiring of workers also showed 
big gains at restaurants, computer companies and engineering firms.

	Clinton: GOP Tax Cut Will Not Happen

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Only hours after Republicans pushed their $792  
billion tax cut through Congress, President Clinton declared today 
that ``this tax cut will not become law.'' Clinton repeated his 
determination to veto the bill as he left the White House for a 
trip to Arkansas. Republican congressional leaders prepared to take 
their case for the tax cut to the American people during the August 
congressional recess. Both houses of Congress passed the tax cut 
yesterday: 50-49 in the Senate after a 221-206 vote in the House.

	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Firefighters brought in from around the  
country to fight wildfires that have blackened more than 900 square 
miles of Nevada range are expected to work into the weekend. The 
fires are estimated to have burned 600,000 acres by early today, an 
area nearly the size of Rhode Island. An additional 1,700 
firefighters were shipped in yesterday, bringing the total by this 
morning to 2,500 with more on the way. ``It's too early to say how 
long it will take. There are so many fires and we are spread so 
thin,'' JoLynn Worley, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Land

	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Violent flare-ups involving NATO  
troops injured a Russian soldier and an ethnic Albanian and 
prompted a peacekeeping spokesman to express concern today about 
attacks on Kosovo peacekeepers. The violence overnight included 
three attacks on Russian soldiers at checkpoints in eastern Kosovo, 
an exchange of gunfire with people trying to attack a Serb home in 
the southern city of Urosevac, and three cases in which shots were 
fired at other NATO checkpoints or patrols. One Russian soldier was 
wounded in the thigh, and an ethnic Albanian was seriously injured. 
NATO forces detained a total of 15 suspects.

	Mass Cremation Readied in India

	GAISAL, India (AP) -- Workers stacked wood into funeral pyres  
today for a mass cremation of disfigured, rotting corpses that 
remained unidentified days after one of India's worst train wrecks 
killed 285 people. Relatives of people thought to have died in the 
collision early Monday have searched through two hospitals in 
northeastern India where the bodies are laid out. But with so many 
victims crushed beyond recognition, 190 bodies remained unclaimed. 
Fearing health risks, the northeastern state's top elected official 
ordered the mass cremations to go ahead today.

land just south of the Grand Canyon. The U.S. Forest Service today 
will announce which development plan would receive its endorsement. 
Some predict the agency will select a $330 million project covering

eighth-inning blast which hit the scoreboard. McGwire leads the 
majors with 44 home runs, two more than Sammy Sosa, and tops the NL

<HEADLINE> Some Players Kick About NFL Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANKATO, Minn. (AP) -- New kicking rules this season mean NFL  
teams are less likely to line up for long field goal attempts, such 
as the record-tying 63-yarder Jason Elam of Denver hit last season. 
</P>
<P>
	And it seems certain no one will match the perfect season put  
together by Minnesota's Gary Anderson, who says the new rules are 
an overreaction to rumors of doctored footballs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The basic theory is they don't want us to do our jobs as well  
as we do them,'' said Anderson, who made all 35 of his field goals 
and all 59 of his extra points in the regular season last year. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, whenever a kicker lines up for a field goal, an  
official will swap the game ball for a new one that hasn't been 
thrown, carried or caught. 
</P>
<P>
	The league wants to prevent any possible tampering with balls,  
especially by kickers and punters. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be very strange that you have two sets of balls.  
A quarterback throws one ball but as soon as it comes time to punt 
or kick a field goal, they're going to whip a different ball out 
there so we can't kick it as well,'' Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like maybe telling a tennis player with a really good  
serve, `We're going to give you a soft ball so you can't serve as 
hard.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Only the NFL kickers will be getting harder footballs.  
</P>
<P>
	Previously, 36 game balls (24 for indoor games) were shipped to  
the home club on a Friday before a Sunday game. Quarterbacks were 
permitted to test the balls on Friday or Saturday by throwing them. 
That softened them up and took the sheen off the leather. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, 12 of those balls will be sent directly to the stadium and  
taken out of their boxes by officials two hours before kickoff. The 
balls will be branded with a ``K'' and used exclusively for the 
kicking game. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, stories have circulated around the league about  
footballs being doctored, even being placed in ovens or clothes 
dryers to mellow the leather. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quarterbacks have complained to us about the condition of some  
balls used in games,'' said George Young, NFL senior vice president 
of football operations. ``We want to make sure that the 
quarterbacks are comfortable with the balls. We also want all the 
kickers and punters to be playing on an even field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Seeman, NFL director of officiating, said the 12  
kicking-only balls will be rubbed down by officials just like the 
other 24 footballs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The officials will also check the inflation of all footballs  
to be used for that game,'' Seeman said. ``All the players can rest 
assured that the balls will be of the highest quality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, who missed just one kick last year -- the one in the  
NFC title game that might have sent the Vikings to the Super Bowl -- 
wonders why the NFL wants to penalize kickers when the other 
nonkicking balls can still be broken in as usual. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a really strange effort,'' Anderson said.  
</P>
<P>
	The problem is that a new ball is easier to shank. So, kickers  
across the NFL are practicing with newer footballs during training 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be like making a baseball player go out there, like  
an Ozzie Smith, and telling him he's got to field with a brand new 
glove,'' Anderson said. ``We all know where leather comes from, and 
a brand new football, just like a brand new baseball, is very hard 
and nobody likes to field the ball with a new baseball glove. No 
quarterback likes to throw a brand new football. Nobody likes to 
catch one or kick one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson isn't alone in his arguments.  
</P>
<P>
	Michael Husted of the Oakland Raiders said: ``On kickoffs, it  
certainly will make a difference. The analogy is what if you made 
every baseball player go out there with a new glove every game. The 
leather is real stiff. If the football is softer, it can spring off 
your foot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You won't see any 63-yard field goals this year. And you won't  
see as many 50-plus yard attempts,'' Husted predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Not to mention 35 of 35.  
</P>
<P>
	``They're always moving the kickoff's spot back, making the goal  
posts narrower, making your tee shorter, tying your legs 
together,'' Anderson said. ``They don't like us.''

<HEADLINE> Bozer Ibeabuchi Can't Make Bail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A heavyweight boxing contender accused of  
raping a woman in his Las Vegas hotel room is still in jail after a 
judge set his bail at $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Ike Ibeabuchi, known as ``The President,'' failed to come up  
with the bail money Friday and will likely stay in the Clark County 
Detention Center until his next court appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	A preliminary hearing has been scheduled for Aug. 25 to  
determine if there is enough evidence for a criminal trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Ibeabuchi is charged with sexual assault, attempted sexual  
assault, kidnapping and battery with intent to commit sexual 
assault. 
</P>
<P>
	All the charges stem from an incident at The Mirage hotel-casino  
in July when a 21-year-old out-call dancer told police she was 
raped by the boxer after being called to his suite. 
</P>
<P>
	The 26-year-old Nigerian boxer was scheduled to be arraigned  
July 30 but had to be removed from court after he became upset that 
the prosecution wanted bail set at $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Ibeabuchi is undefeated at 20-0 with 15 knockouts and ranked No.  
2 by the IBF.

<HEADLINE> Media Seek Cop Site Photo Removal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Gov. George Pataki has been asked by prominent  
journalism groups to order the state police to remove copyright 
news photos from its Woodstock '99 Web pages. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen news photos were posted on the state police web site --  
eight by photographers for The Associated Press, four carried by 
Syracuse Online and two from newspapers -- in an attempt to identify 
possible suspects in the rioting and looting that followed the 
concert. 
</P>
<P>
	The photos were posted July 30 without the permission of the  
news organizations. Both the AP and Syracuse Online demanded the 
photos be taken down, saying the action infringed on copyrights and 
damaged the traditional separation of newsgathering from police 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn Valle, counsel for the state police, said Thursday police  
have no plans to remove the photos. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the position of the New York State Police that the  
posting of the previously published newsphotos ... does not 
infringe upon any copyright interests of The Associated Press,'' 
Valle said in a letter. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Press Club, The Deadline Club, The New York State  
Associated Press Association and Debby Krenek, editor-in-chief of 
the New York Daily News, each wrote to Pataki to oppose the posting 
of the photos. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you allow the State Police's use of the AP's photos to  
persist, the public's confidence in the independence and accuracy 
of the press will be eroded,'' Krenek said. ``Inevitably members of 
the press will be perceived as law enforcement operatives and our 
ability to report independently and thoroughly will be 
compromised.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rosemary K. Robinson, managing editor/days of Syracuse  
Newspapers, which provides material to Syracuse Online, wrote 
Pataki to ``protest police use of these photographs in this way for 
the potential harm it does the newsgathering process.'' Robinson 
also is president of the association of New York State papers 
affiliated with the AP. 
</P>
<P>
	``The role and responsibility of the State Police investigating  
events at Woodstock are both clear and important,'' wrote Louis D. 
Boccardi, president and CEO of the AP. ``So also is the historic 
and equally important separation of police functions and 
journalistic functions. If our photographers are to be seen as 
proxies for state police investigators, they will be placed in 
danger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valle, in his letter, rejected the contention that ``utilization  
of the photos under these circumstances, could lead any reasonable 
person to infer that The Associated Press is `an arm of the 
state.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon said the governor had ``asked  
his counsel to review'' the letters. 
</P>
<P>
	State police said the photos have produced more than 150 e-mail  
responses. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus far, 39 arrests have been made on charges ranging from  
disorderly conduct to sodomy. No arrests have been made in the five 
rapes reported at the event, or in any other major 
Woodstock-related crimes. The police have not said whether any of 
the arrests resulted from the pictures on the Web site.

<HEADLINE> Limits on Trucker Hours Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Highway Administration is ready to  
propose new limits on the number of hours truckers can drive each 
day, the first change in their work rules in over 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency, in a rule anticipated this fall, is expected to  
force drivers to be off duty for at least 14 hours in a 24-hour 
period, according to trucking industry sources, who spoke on the 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Gail Shibley, spokeswoman for the Highway Administration,  
refused to discuss the specifics, pending release of the rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, truckers are limited to 10 hours behind the wheel in  
one stretch. They then must stop driving for eight hours. After 
that, they can resume driving for up to 10 more hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The Highway Administration contends that if truckers are ordered  
off the road for 14 hours in a 24-hour period, it will improve the 
chances they get at least eight hours of sleep during their down 
time, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, 5,302 people were killed in truck-related accidents  
on the nation's highways, according to preliminary figures from the 
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	That is a slight drop from 1997 and part of an overall trend in  
which the truck-related highway fatality rate has been falling, 
despite increased trucking mileage fueled by cheaper gas and an 
increase in just-in-time business deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, over 3 percent of the truck-related accidents were  
caused by drowsy truckers, and there has been talk for years about 
ways to improve truck safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Just this week, Congress and the Clinton administration unveiled  
competing truck-safety legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest truckers group, the American Trucking  
Associations, questioned the Highway Administration's proposal. It 
sent a letter to the agency Thursday asking it to explain the 
science behind its proposal, if any was used. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a proposal that we will be offering, but we are  
putting it to the scientific test now,'' said Mike Russell, the 
group's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the ATA's proposal, which could be unveiled as early as  
September, will focus less on the number of hours worked and rather 
``on the number of hours of rest and the quality of the rest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shibley said that when the highway administration unveils its  
final rule, ``it will be science-based'' and grounded ``on the 
reality of circadian rhythms and body science.''

</P>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Harley R. Bierce, who shared in a Pulitzer  
Prize for exposing police corruption, died Tuesday while on a 
mountain climbing trip in Colorado. He was 58. 
</P>
<P>
	Bierce collapsed Tuesday, according to his son, Ben Bierce.  
</P>
<P>
	A school teacher before becoming a reporter at the Indianapolis  
Star, Bierce in later years worked as an insurance executive and 
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a founding member of the Investigative Reporters and  
Editors, and he and another reporter, Richard Cady, formed an 
investigative reporting team in 1973 that produced a series 
exposing corruption in the Indianapolis Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Their work, along with that of reporter Bill Anderson, helped  
the Star earn a Pulitzer Prize for special local reporting in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1978, he left newspapers to become vice president and  
director of market research and planning for Meridian Insurance in 
Indianapolis. He later moved to Chicago, where he was the principal 
figure in Bierce and Associates, an insurance consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Bierce served in the Army for two years, spending a year in  
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	Other survivors include a daughter.

<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- David William ``D.W.'' Brooks, the founder of  
farming cooperative and poultry-processing giant Gold Kist Inc., 
died Thursday. He was 97. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks formed the farm cooperative that would become Gold Kist  
in 1933 as the Georgia Cooperative Cotton Producers Association. It 
would grow to become the nation's second largest poultry processor 
with annual sales of more than $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks also started Cotton Sales Mutual Insurance Companies in  
1941 to provide farmers with fire and wind insurance. The company 
now insures farmers in 10 Southern states. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks served as an adviser to seven presidents, from Harry S.  
Truman to Jimmy Carter. He was named Georgia's Man of the Year in 
Agriculture in 1955 and Man of the Year in Agriculture in the South 
in 1966 by Progressive Farmer magazine.

in the early years of National Association for Stock Car Auto 
Racing four decades ago, died July 20 after a heart attack. He was 
79. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahoney ranked seventh in total points on the Grand National  
circuit in 1959, the second year of what would become Winston Cup 
racing. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahoney, whose hard-driving style earned him the nicknames  
``Three Wheels'' and ``Wild Man,'' finished fifth in the first 
Darlington 500. He made a name for himself while competing against 
the likes of Lee Petty and Fireball Roberts, and was named NASCAR 
driver of the month in November 1957.

on TV's 1970s comedy ``Operation Petticoat'' to directing recent 
episodes of ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' died July 19 from a heart 
attack. He was 50. 
</P>
<P>
	Marion was a founding member of the San Francisco Bay Area's  
Magic Theater, which became known for its presentation of 
cutting-edge playwrights like Sam Shepard.

	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Former Florida Supreme Court Chief  
Justice B.K. Roberts died Wednesday. He was 92. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts served 27 years on the state's highest court, including  
three terms as chief justice. He also spent 14 years as chairman of 
the Judicial Council, taking leadership roles in creating Florida's 
Judicial Qualifications Commission, the Public Defender System and 
the law school at Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts served as a member of the 1968 Florida Constitution  
Revision Commission chaired by Chesterfield Smith, a former 
president of the American Bar Association who built the law firm of 
Holland &AMP; Knight into one of the state's most prestigious firms. 
</P>
<P>
	When he retired from the state Supreme Court in 1976, Roberts

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rabbi David J. Seligson, a nationally known  
Reform rabbi who held the pulpit at Central Synagogue in Manhattan 
for two decades, died Tuesday. He was 92. 
</P>
<P>
	Seligson led a memorial service after the assassination of  
President John F. Kennedy which was broadcast on network 
television. The rabbi was also regularly heard on radio as the host 
of the syndicated ``Message from Israel'' program. 
</P>
<P>
	He was invited to Central Synagogue, the East Side landmark  
which is in some senses a national pulpit, to assist the rabbi in 
1945. He was made senior rabbi in 1950 and held that position until 
he was named rabbi emeritus in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, he was among the first Jewish chaplains to volunteer  
to serve overseas during World War II, work he considered his 
touchstone. 
</P>
<P>
	Seligson helped expand interfaith relations in New York,  
speaking in churches and inviting them to join in annual 
Thanksgiving interfaith worship service. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1950s, Seligson served as president of the New York Board  
of rabbis and the New York Association of Reform Rabbis.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stanley Stahl, a real estate and banking magnate  
who prosecutors say was the target of a failed murder-for-hire by 
multimillionaire developer Abe Hirschfeld, died Thursday of a 
stroke. He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	Stahl was the sole stockholder of Apple Bank for Savings, which  
he acquired for $174 million dollars in a hostile takeover in 1990. 
His real estate investments include about four million square feet 
of office space, residential buildings with more than 3,000 
apartments and numerous retail buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Hirschfeld, the flamboyant parking lot tycoon, was  
indicted on charges of hiring someone to kill Stahl, his former 
business partner, for $75,000 in 1996. Prosecutors say the two had 
been partners on several real estate properties. The plot, they 
say, fell apart. Hirschfeld is to be tried later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Stahl, who was known as a ferociously tough negotiator, bought  
several Broadway theaters and at one time owned the original 
Lindy's restaurant in Manhattan's theater district.

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Carl Toms, one of the most sought after and  
successful British stage designers of his time, died Wednesday of 
emphysema. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	Toms designed sets for the theater, films, opera and ballet in a  
career that spanned 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	He hit his stride in 1969 when he was chosen design consultant  
for the ceremony to invest Charles, Queen Elizabeth II's oldest 
son, as the Prince of Wales at Caernarvon Castle in Wales. For 
that, Toms was awarded the prestigious Order of the British Empire. 
Commissions to redecorate several West End theaters and other 
well-known venues followed. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides designing sets for more than 40 stage productions in  
London, New York and Los Angeles, Toms was known for his work for 
the English National Ballet, the Royal Opera House, the National 
Theatre, Vienna National Theatre, Vienna State Opera, the 
Metropolitan Opera in New York, the San Diego Opera Co. and the San 
Francisco Opera. 
</P>
<P>
	He also designed sets and costumes for numerous films.  
</P>
<P>
	He won a Tony Award and Drama Desk Award for theater design in  
1974 for ``Sherlock Holmes,'' which had runs in London and New 
York.

                             *Gene Weed    	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Gene Weed, a producer and director of  
television specials and awards shows for more than 25 years, died 
Thursday of cancer. Weed was 64. 
</P>
<P>
	Weed's varied entertainment career included 15 years as a top  
radio disc jockey, host of the 1960s syndicated television show 
``Shivaree,'' seven years as board chairman of The Academy of 
Country Music and a recent election as president of that 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a pioneer in the field of what has become music videos,  
producing and directing more than 200 films of performances by 
artists including Glen Campbell, The Fifth Dimension, Creedence 
Clearwater Revival and Debby Boone. 
</P>
<P>
	Weed joined dick clark productions inc. in the 1970s, and became  
its senior vice president for television. Beginning in 1974 he 
produced, directed or performed both roles for several annual 
television shows including the ``Golden Globe Awards'' and ``The 
Academy of Country Music Awards.'' He also was producer-director of 
the ``Hot Country Nights'' series on NBC 1991-92 and its revival in 
1994-95 on The Nashville Network. 
</P>
<P>
	Weed produced or directed dozens of television specials  
including the three-hour ``Live Aid'' concert on ABC, Live Aid III 
and IV, and a 90-minute special preceding the 1994 World Cup soccer 
tournament, viewed by an estimated 750 million people around the 
world.

<HEADLINE> Justice Says Italian To Be Returned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Italian radical serving a 40-year prison  
term in the United States for terrorism might be returned to Italy 
as early as the end of August to serve out her term, a senior 
Justice Department official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But although the end of this month is possible, the transfer of  
Sylvia Baraldini, 51, likely will happen well after that, said the 
official, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Now at the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Conn.,  
Baraldini was convicted in 1983 of trying to rob a Brinks armored 
truck. She also was convicted of kidnapping for her role in the 
prison breakout of a Black Liberation Army leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Baraldini was part of a Marxist and black  
nationalist group called ``the Family,'' accused of crimes dating 
to 1976. Other members of the group were convicted of a 1981 Brinks 
heist in New York in which a guard and two policemen were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters have depicted the U.S. decision to allow Baraldini to  
serve the remainder of her sentence in Italy as a goodwill gesture 
after a court-martial acquitted a U.S. Marine pilot in the deaths 
of 20 people at an Italian ski resort. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice spokesman Myron Marlin said final details of Baraldini's  
transfer to Italy were still being worked out. A hearing still must 
be scheduled in U.S. District Court in New York, where she will be 
asked if she consents to the transfer. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a few steps remaining to be completed, and we are  
working with the Italian government on them,'' Marlin said.

<HEADLINE> Child Labor Treaty Goes to Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration has sent to the  
Senate an international treaty intended to protect children from 
jobs that expose them to danger or exploitation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I urge the United States Senate to support this convention to  
demonstrate our commitment and enhance our ability to help lead the 
world in eliminating the worst forms of child labor,'' said Clinton 
in a statement Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials said they sent the treaty to the Senate  
Foreign Relations Committee late Thursday to begin the ratification 
process. Treaty matters have caused severe strains in the past 
between the administration and the committee chairman, Sen. Jesse 
Helms, R-N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, however, a spokesman for Sen. Joseph Biden of  
Delaware, the panel's senior Democrat, said Helms joined Biden in 
passing the word that they would welcome a chance to consider the 
child-labor treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, the Senate passed without opposition a nonbinding  
resolution, sponsored by Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, stating generally 
that the U.S. should condemn abusive child-labor practices around 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way to handicap how this is going to go,'' said  
Chris Madison, Biden's spokesman, but he added: ``We certainly 
think that this is going to be taken seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helms' spokesman Marc Thiessen refused comment. He said the  
senator and his staff are evaluating the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	The Foreign Relations chairman has blocked consideration of a  
nuclear test ban treaty Clinton signed in 1996. He has threatened 
to hold up other accords as well, because of a disagreement with 
the administration over pending updates to antiballistic missile 
treaties with Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration played a leading role in negotiating  
the child labor treaty, unanimously approved in June by delegates 
to the 174-country International Labor Organization, an arm of the 
United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The accord would require no changes in U.S. law, a review by the  
administration and legal experts from the AFL-CIO and the Council 
for International Business concluded. The council and the union 
federation are among U.S. representatives to the ILO. 
</P>
<P>
	ILO countries must separately ratify the treaty, and President  
Clinton has urged that the United States set an example. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty targets only the most egregious forms of child  
servitude, including slavery and debt bondage; the use of children 
for prostitution, in pornography or illegal activities such as drug 
trafficking; and particularly hazardous work such as mining. 
</P>
<P>
	It also condemns the ``forced or compulsory recruitment of  
children for use in armed conflict'' but not voluntary military 
recruitment of those under 18. The United States is among several 
countries that allow 17-year-olds with parental approval to join 
the armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty urges governments to impose criminal penalties,  
specify preventive measures and act to help child victims recover 
through such remedies as free basic education. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate consideration of the treaty could not begin before  
Congress returns from its traditional August recess, after Labor 
Day. Ratification would require a two-thirds majority vote.

<HEADLINE> Players Prepare for Hall Induction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANTON, Ohio (AP) -- Ozzie Newsome and Tom Mack are coming home.  
</P>
<P>
	Newsome, who spent his entire career with the Cleveland Browns,  
and Mack, a native of Cleveland, are returning to their old 
neighborhood to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on 
Saturday. They'll be joined by New York Giants linebacker Lawrence 
Taylor, No. 3 career rusher Eric Dickerson and veterans committee 
nominee Billy Shaw in the 1999 class. 
</P>
<P>
	Rounding out the Cleveland-themed weekend, the new Browns  
expansion franchise takes the field for the first time when it 
takes on Dallas in Monday night's Hall of Fame exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsome waited four years before gaining admission, but the  
timing couldn't have been better. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was worth the wait,'' said Newsome, who will be presented  
by former Browns teammate Calvin Hill. ``There was disappointment 
the first year, the second year and the third year when I got into 
the final six, but didn't make it. 
</P>
<P>
	To be going in at the same time those guys are going back on the  
field -- those orange helmets show up and football returns to the 
lakefront -- that makes it worth the wait.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newsome became one of the game's pre-eminent tight ends in his  
13 seasons with the Browns, catching 662 passes for 7,980 yards and 
47 touchdowns. Born in Muscle Shoals, Ala., and a former player for 
the Crimson Tide, Newsome rarely dropped a pass, missed a block or 
ran a ragged route. 
</P>
<P>
	He became the Browns' director of pro personnel in 1994 and then  
moved to Baltimore when owner Art Modell broke the hearts of 
Clevelanders by taking away the franchise that became the Baltimore 
Ravens. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsome's heart still belongs to the Browns. He's not worried  
about fans who consider him a traitor for making the move to 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's entitled to their own opinion,'' he said. ``I  
guess if anything, I'm guilty by association.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mack, a 6-foot-3, 250-pound offensive guard, grew up in  
Cleveland, but went on to an All-American career at the University 
of Michigan. Drafted No. 2 overall in the 1966 draft, he went on to 
play all of his 13 seasons with the Los Angeles Rams -- going 184 
games without missing a game due to injury or illness. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's truly exciting to literally feel like you're going back  
home to Ohio,'' Mack said soon after finding out about his 
induction. 
</P>
<P>
	He had to wait 11 years to finally get the call to Canton, while  
Shaw -- a starring offensive guard for the Buffalo Bills from 1961 
to 1969 -- waited almost three times that. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were only three guards in the hall. Now he and I make  
five,'' Shaw said. ``I can't explain to you why more guards haven't 
made it into the Hall of Fame. But it's an honor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor and Dickerson didn't have to wait at all. Both were  
elected in their first year of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	They have more than that in common. Taylor, who played from 1981  
to 1993 with the Giants, and Dickerson, who spent time with four 
teams and amassed seven 1,000-yard rushing seasons with the Rams 
and Indianapolis Colts, were also known for their off-the-field 
exploits. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor has encountered legal, financial and substance-abuse  
problems since retiring. He has referred to those who didn't vote 
for his induction as ``old phonies'' not fit to judge him. 
</P>
<P>
	There was never any doubt about his fitness as a player.  
</P>
<P>
	``If there ever was a Superman in the NFL,'' former Washington  
quarterback Joe Theismann said, ``I think he wore No. 56 for the 
Giants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dickerson frequently wrangled with management during his playing  
days. Contentious contract negotiations led to his trade from the 
Rams to the Colts. While in Indianapolis, he was suspended for 
refusing to take a team physical and for refusing to practice. The 
Colts eventually met his demand to be traded. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite 13,259 career yards, Dickerson feels his induction  
confirms that he is acknowledged for what he did on the field and 
not any of the other headlines he made off it. 
</P>
<P>
	``That'll be a proud moment for me,'' he said recently. ``I  
never made it to a Super Bowl. ``For me, this shows I did do 
something right in my sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dickerson will be presented by one of his Ram blockers, Jackie  
Slater. Mack followed suit in choosing a Rams teammate and 
offensive lineman, Ken Iman, as his presenter. Taylor will be 
introduced by his 17-year-old son, T.J., and Shaw by a former Bills 
trainer.

<HEADLINE> Candidates Respond to Tax Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	What the Republican and Democratic candidates for the White  
House in 2000 are saying about the tax relief legislation passed in 
the House on Thursday: 
</P>
<P>
	LAMAR ALEXANDER supports the tax cut package, but said he has  
different priorities than congressional Republicans. His priorities 
include tripling the child tax deduction to $8,000 and extending 
the credit to people who care for their elderly parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want the Republican Party to be the party of honoring the  
job of father and mother,'' Alexander said. ``As president, I would 
have met with the legislative leaders ahead of time'' to say, 
``Let's put our money where our values are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GARY BAUER also favors the tax cuts, but doesn't think they do  
enough, soon enough. ``It sounds like a lot of money, but spread 
out over 10 years. ... I think we could have done more,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer is also troubled that the marriage penalty is reduced, not  
eliminated. ``I don't know why there is one dollar of penalty for 
someone who gets married,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	If president, Bauer would encourage a higher child tax credit  
and a 20 percent reduction in payroll taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	PAT BUCHANAN said he is all for the plan and gives ``two cheers  
for the GOP.'' However, the plan is still too modest, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The personal income tax (reduction) takes too long,'' he said.  
``If you've got a surplus of $100 billion dollars, take half of 
that -- $30 or $50 billion -- and give it back to the American people 
because the government doesn't need it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Buchanan were in White House, he said he would push for a  
dramatic tax plan that took two years to take effect. 
</P>
<P>
	GEORGE W. BUSH said he likes the tax cut bill ``as it is,''  
particularly measures that cut the marginal rates across the board. 
He said the nation can afford to lower tax rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is why I so strongly support the tax cuts that have just  
been enacted by the House and Senate and urge the president to sign 
the bill,'' he said. ``In my judgment, we ought to pass back the 
money to the people who pay the taxes. I strongly support the 
reduction in rates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ELIZABETH DOLE said the American people deserve to keep more of  
their ``hard-earned money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The tax burden is at a 50-year high, and I believe it's wrong  
to keep taxes at this level,'' she said in a statement. ``Unless 
President Clinton wants to be known as the president who 
perpetuated the marriage penalty, he should sign this tax relief 
plan into law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	STEVE FORBES, a flat-tax supporter, would prefer a tax plan that  
simplified the code, though he would sign the House bill if he were 
president, said campaign spokeswoman Juleanna Glover Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
	He thinks ``it's a step in the right direction,'' she said.  
``This is better than the Congress and the Clinton Administration 
spending the money, by all means. But it doesn't go as far as it 
should.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ORRIN HATCH praised elements of the legislation, including the  
marriage penalty reduction and increased access to IRAs, calling 
the package ``balanced'' and ``fiscally responsible'' in a speech 
on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he expressed disappointment that the legislation did  
not make tax breaks for research and experimentation permanent. ``I 
still believe that our American research engine would be helped 
significantly by relieving the uncertainty that the sunseted credit 
imposes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	JOHN McCAIN voted with the 50-49 Senate majority Thursday for  
the tax bill but called it unacceptable and said his vote 
represents only his desire to keep the issue alive for a better 
bill after Clinton's promised veto. 
</P>
<P>
	``My problem with this bill is not with the size of the tax  
cuts, but who benefits,'' he said. ``Special interests get the 
biggest breaks and they get them right away. All the American 
families get are the leftovers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DAN QUAYLE said he believes this tax package should serve as a  
beginning. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Republican Congress must continue to push for greater tax  
relief,'' said campaign spokesman Jonathan Baron. ``That's why 
(Quayle) has proposed a 30 percent across-the-board tax cut to 
benefit all Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AL GORE believes the Republican tax plan squanders the best  
chance in a generation to pay down the national debt and save 
Social Security, said campaign spokesman Roger Salazar. Gore would 
veto the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``He supports a pro-growth, pro-savings, pro-family tax cut that  
fits within a responsible framework,'' Salazar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Clinton, Gore believes the tax cut should be in the $250  
billion to $350 billion range. 
</P>
<P>
	BILL BRADLEY supports tax plans with the fewest loopholes and  
lowest rates for more Americans, said campaign spokesman Tony 
Wyche. If president, Bradley would veto the current legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has said many times over that in good economic times, a  
surplus should be used to deal with problems we couldn't deal with 
in worse economic times,'' Wyche said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there is a tax cut, it should be targeted to lower- and  
middle-income families who haven't benefited from the current 
economic expansion, not those at the top of the economic food 
chain,'' Wyche added.

	Stocks Close Lower; Dow Down 79.79  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks resumed their slide today as a  
strong report on U.S. employment solidified Wall Street's belief 
that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates later this 
month. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 79.79 at 
10,714.03, erasing more than half of yesterday's 119-point gain. 
The blue-chip index ended a choppy week 58.08 points higher. 
Broader stock indicators like the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index and 
the Nasdaq composite index fell modestly today, capping a week of 
steep losses. The Nasdaq was down 17.64 at 2,548.19.

	Jobless Rate Steady at 4.3 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The unemployment rate held steady at 4.3  
percent in July as employers added 310,000 jobs to their payrolls, 
the Labor Department said today. In addition, workers' average 
hourly earnings -- a key gauge of inflation pressures -- were up by 
3.8 percent, a larger rise than analysts' had expected. The 
increase was seen as possibly adding to inflation worries. 

</P>
<P>
	Consumer Borrowing Rises  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' rate of borrowing went up in June  
reflecting heavy credit card use, but the pace wasn't nearly as 
exuberant as it had been the month before. Consumers' credit 
outstanding, excluding mortgage debt, advanced at a 2.5 percent 
annual rate in June to a seasonally adjusted $1.347 trillion, the 
Federal Reserve said. All told, consumers borrowed $2.8 billion 
more in June than during the month before, well below many 
analysts' expectations. The increase in June's rate follows a hefty 
10.5 percent gain in May -- the largest increase since January. In 
April, consumer borrowing rose 0.3 percent, less than the Fed 
previously estimated.

<P>
	CANTON, Texas (AP) -- Jurors found pharmaceutical giant American  
Home Products Corp. liable for a Texas woman's heart ailment, 
awarding her $23.36 million in the first case involving the 
diet-drug combination fen-phen to reach a jury. Debbie Lovett, 36, 
blamed the nation's seventh-largest drug maker for heart-valve 
damage she claimed she suffered after taking the drugs for more 
than three months in 1995. Jurors determined the company was 100 
percent liable for Ms. Lovett's injuries. Shares of AHP were at 
44 7/8, down 6 1/16.

	ROTTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Consumer products maker Unilever  
said its second-quarter profits rose 11 percent on strong 
performances in Asia Pacific, North American, African and Mideast 
markets. The Anglo-Dutch firm whose diverse products include Calvin 
Klein fragrances, Wisk laundry detergents and Lipton tea reported 
that its profits before one-time items totaled $809 million, up 
from $729 million a year earlier. When one-time items are included, 
net profits totaled $759 million, up 3 percent from $735 million. 
Sales rose 3.6 percent to $11.85 billion from $11.45 billion. 
Shares of Unilever were at 72, down 2.

	Hearst Buys San Francisco Chronicle  
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The Hearst Corp., publisher of the San  
Francisco Examiner, said today it has bought the San Francisco 
Chronicle from the family that has owned the newspaper since its 
inception 134 years ago. In a brief statement, John Sias, the 
president of Chronicle Publishing Co., told Chronicle employees 
that their jobs would be maintained under existing union contracts. 
The heirs of the De Young family, which has owned the Chronicle 
since it began, decided to put it on the market two months ago. 
Under a joint operating agreement with the Examiner, Hearst had the 
right to match any offer for the property.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Aetna Inc., which this summer became the  
nation's largest health insurer with its purchase of Prudential 
Health Care, denied rumors today that it plans to acquire Oxford 
Health Plans Inc. Aetna said its focus is completing its Prudential 
acquisition and integrating the company into its operations. 
Norwalk, Conn.-based Oxford is expected to become profitable this 
year after accounting problems led to millions in losses the past 
two years. Shares of Aetna were at 81 9/16, down 2 7/8. Shares of 
Oxford were at 16 1/2, up 1/4.

	Deutsche Telekom To Buy One2One  
</P>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Deutsche Telekom is buying the British mobile  
phone business One2One for $11 billion, trying to get back on track 
in its transformation from former state monopoly to global 
communications company. Telekom, no longer protected from 
competition in Germany, unsuccessfully sought to merge with Telecom 
Italia earlier this year. Not only did the bid fail, but the solo 
attempt soured Telekom's ties with partner France Telecom, which 
declared their relationship over. Analysts praised the One2One 
deal, but only as a first step toward competing in an increasingly 
global market dominated by Internet and wireless communications. 
About 95 percent of Telekom's annual sales still come from the 
German market.

	France Bank Battle Nears End  
</P>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Open warfare among France's banking titans drew to  
a close today as investors scrambled to make decisions that would 
profoundly transform the country's traditionally sedate financial 
world. While all sides were predicting victory, the outcome is far 
from clear in the five-month takeover battle, which pits Banque 
Nationale de Paris, or BNP, against Societe Generale and Paribas. A 
merger of the three banks would create the world's first $1 
trillion bank in terms of assets. Stockholders had until midnight 
(6 p.m. EDT) to pledge their shares to rival plans by BNP and 
Societe Generale, which both aim to create a global banking giant. 
But even after the vote closes, French banking authorities won't 
announce the results until Aug. 17, at the earliest.

November 1997 and BP Amoco closed at 1,216 pence ($19.58), up 9 
pence (15 cents). Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index was up 0.6 percent to 
5,010.47. London's FTSE 100 Index rose 0.3 percent to 6,121.00, 
Amsterdam's AEX index climbed 1.2 percent to 535.10, while Milan's

	Four Small Brokerages Fined for Y2K

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Four small brokerage firms have been slapped  
with fines of $20,000 or $50,000 for allegedly failing to meet 
deadlines for fully disclosing their computer systems' readiness 
for the Year 2000. Some of the brokerages, however, contend that 
the fines are overly severe because they are completely prepared 
for the date change and, in at least two cases, they eventually 
submitted the required reports. An attorney for two of the firms 
said today they planned an appeal to the full Securities and 
Exchange Commission. The ruling was made by an an administrative 
law judge at the SEC.

<HEADLINE> Nets Give Van Horn 6-Year Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- There was no dawdling in  
negotiations when the New Jersey Nets decided it was time to sign 
forward Keith Van Horn. 
</P>
<P>
	``We actually tried to drag it out to make it last two  
minutes,'' principal owner Lewis Katz said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Horn got an maximum-length, six-year extension, valued at  
roughly $73 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is clearly a linchpin in our hopes for a championship team.  
Hopefully, this year, with everyone healthy, we'll live up to our 
potential,'' Katz said at a news conference to discuss Van Horn's 
six-year contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Horn, 23, who lives in suburban Franklin Lakes with his wife  
and two children, said he was eager to stay with the Nets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I made it a little too obvious, '' he said, adding that  
the rehiring of coach Don Casey played an important role in his 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, announced Sunday, should keep Van Horn, the team's  
leading scorer for the past two seasons, in New Jersey until at 
least 2006. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think, on paper, we have one of the most talented teams in  
the league, but that's just on paper. But now we have to go on the 
court and prove it,'' Van Horn said. 
</P>
<P>
	The team had similar hopes last year, but lost 17 of its first  
20 games, fired coach John Calipari and missed the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets were 13-17 under Casey despite being beset by injuries.  
All-Star Jayson Williams broke his leg, Van Horn broke his thumb 
and shooting guard Kerry Kittles had a bad knee, which has since 
required surgery. The team also lost point guard Sam Cassell and 
centers Jim McIlvaine and Rony Seikaly to injuries for extended 
periods. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassell was traded in a deal that brought Stephon Marbury to New  
Jersey during the season, and Seikaly was put on waivers this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was a disaster,'' Katz said. ``This year we should  
be very competitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 6-foot-10 power forward with the moves of a small forward, Van  
Horn averaged 20.5 points and 7.4 rebounds in his first two 
seasons. He averaged 19.7 points as a rookie and 21.8 last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 10 or 15 years when Keith's time in the NBA may be up, we  
believe people will be talking about the next young kid that comes 
out as the next Keith Van Horn,'' Nets president Michael Rowe said.

<HEADLINE> Alabama's DuBose Garners Attention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) -- For the second time in a year, the  
personal life of a major college football coach in Alabama has 
drawn the kind of interest usually given to the team's on-the-field 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	First it was Terry Bowden at Auburn, who publicly denied rumors  
of an extramarital affair after his abrupt resignation as coach of 
the Tigers last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Alabama coach Mike DuBose, whose third season starts Sunday  
when freshmen report to campus, finds himself in the glare of fan 
scrutiny -- one day after school officials settled a sexual 
harassment claim that had been filed against him by a university 
employee. DuBose apologized for embarrassing his alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, he's definitely on probation,'' Sid McDonald, president of  
the Alabama board of trustees, said Friday. ``I'd say he's going to 
be watched more carefully and judged more critically from here on 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald said he only ``marginally'' agreed with Alabama's  
decision not to fire DuBose immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an on-campus decision to give him a second chance, but  
I think his public image and his leadership abilities have been 
hurt and that's bad because football is very important in 
Tuscaloosa,'' McDonald said. ``But I suspect that if he goes 
11-and-zero this season most of this can go away, to a degree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shaun Alexander, Alabama's star running back who came back for  
his senior year at the urging of DuBose, said the admission will 
not hurt the football team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad that things like that happen,'' Alexander said. ``But  
I don't think it's going to affect the team at all. We're ready to 
go play football and we're not going to let this get in the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone agrees.  
</P>
<P>
	J. Michael Eckerly, a season-ticket holder whose father,  
Charles, played for Alabama in the early 1950's and spent five 
years as an assistant under Bear Bryant, said DuBose should resign 
because the situation can't help but be a distraction. 
</P>
<P>
	``The person who coaches at Alabama has to have the moral  
authority to hold that job -- I hold it in the same regard as the 
President -- and he doesn't have it,'' Eckerly said. ``I'm not one 
to judge, but if you are going to do something like this, you 
either can't get caught or can't coach at Alabama.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mal Moore, a Tide quarterback in 1962 and the current athletic  
director for football relations, said DuBose's admission 
embarrassed the program. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without question it hurts anyone involved with this program to  
see it damaged or tarnished in any way, it hurts deeply to be 
truthful,'' Moore said. ``What is so important here or at any 
school is the great name, and certainly each individual takes pride 
in that and I think Mike has damaged his name.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Moore, who said he has known DuBose since his days as a Tide  
player, said he will support him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He made a very terrible mistake and no one realizes that more  
than Mike does,'' Moore said. ``But I fully intend to try to help 
him and the players all I possibly can to get through this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One person who is reserving judgment against DuBose is Gov. Don  
Siegelman, an Alabama graduate who also is on the board of trustees 
by virtue of his title. But if he had to vote, he said he would 
vote not to fire the coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Mike DuBose is a great coach, I think he has been good  
for the Crimson Tide,'' Siegelman said. ``I am not going to comment 
on his personal life. That is something between Mike and his family 
and in my judgment does not impact his ability to be a good 
coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There wasn't such talk about DuBose eight months ago, when  
Alabama rewarded him with a two-year contract extension. He had 
turned the Crimson Tide around from a 4-7 season in 1997 to 7-5 and 
a berth in the Music City Bowl in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't great by Alabama standards, but two stellar recruiting  
classes had school officials believing he was headed in the right 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
	The trouble surfaced in May when rumors about misconduct in his  
personal life began popping up on talk-radio and on the Internet. 
DuBose issued a statement denying the rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is absolutely no truth or factual basis to any of these  
rumors that you may have heard involving me or other university 
employees,'' he said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Thursday, the school announced a settlement with an  
employee who had accused DuBose of both sexual harassment and 
sexual discrimination, said Janet Griffith, vice president of 
university relations. 
</P>
<P>
	And DuBose admitted to lying about it in May.  
</P>
<P>
	``To say I am sorry is not enough, I know,'' he said Thursday,  
fighting off tears as his wife, Polly, looked on. ``I was wrong, 
but I cannot change the past. Today, I accept the university's 
discipline and punishment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As discipline, his contract was reverted back to the three  
remaining years, he was docked $12,000 a month in pay for the next 
30 months and received a freeze in compensation for the rest of his 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	And to prove just how serious the school was, an amendment was  
added to his contract that threatened termination for any further 
conduct that ``brings the Employee into public disrepute, contempt, 
scandal, or ridicule.''

	Drought Said Worst Since Dust Bowl  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The current drought is the worst ever for  
farmers in Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey and Rhode Island, 
President Clinton said Friday. ``Throughout much of this country, 
we have seen the worst drought since the Dust Bowl days,'' Clinton 
said. Maryland and New Jersey have imposed state water 
restrictions.

	Turkish Union Leader Shot to Death  
</P>
<P>
	ZONGULDAK, Turkey (AP) -- The deputy head of Turkey's largest  
labor union confederation was shot to death outside his home early 
Saturday in the Black Sea coastal city of Zonguldak, the Anatolia 
news agency said. Semsi Denizer, 49, became popular when he led 
some 50,000 striking coal miners on a 165-mile protest march from 
Zonguldak to the capital, Ankara, for higher pay in 1991. He was 
general-secretary of the Turk-Is labor confederation. The 
assailant, Cengiz Balik, who has a long criminal record, was 
arrested after the attack, police said.

	Report: N. Korea Acquiring Jets  
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korea has agreed to buy 40  
MiG-21 fighter jets from a former Soviet republic, a South Korean 
newspaper reported Saturday. Parts for the planes began arriving in 
North Korea by air in July, and the Stalinist state is assembling 
the jets in secret bases, the daily Chosun Ilbo said. The respected 
newspaper cited a high-ranking government official but did not 
identify the exporting country. The report came amid reported 
preparations by North Korea to test a long-range missile despite 
American warnings to scrap the launch.

	Clinton 'Not Surprised' GOP Tax Cut  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said he was ``disappointed  
though not surprised,'' that Republicans had pushed their 10-year, 
$792 billion tax bill through Congress. He calls the bill 
dangerously big, sure to create economic havoc if it becomes law. 
Congressional Republicans are hoping to build up popular pressure 
on the president to pass the bill. Senate Majority Leader Trent 
Lott is urging Americans to tell Washington they want the package. 
``And if they will do that, the president will sign this bill,'' 
Lott predicted.

	Diet Drug Co. Appealing $23M Award  
</P>
<P>
	CANTON, Texas (AP) -- American Home Products Corp. will appeal  
Friday's jury verdict that holds the company liable for a woman's 
heart problems she blames on the diet drug combination fen-phen, 
the company's attorney Bob Schick said today. Debbie Lovett, 36, 
was awarded $23 million in the first such lawsuit to reach a jury. 
Lovett claims she suffered heart-valve problems after taking the 
drugs for more than three months, starting in October 1995.

	Airlines Woo Business Travelers  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Airlines seem to be taking some steps to win over  
their most lucrative customers -- business travelers who fly 
regularly and often pay expensive, last-minute fares. Bigger 
first-class sections, more leg room in certain rows, and no more 
expiring frequent-flyer miles are some attempts to cater to these 
frequent flyers, who have been expressing dissatisfaction with 
airline service. ``Delays are increasing. Service is perceived to 
be worse,'' said Karen Goodwin, editor of Frequent Flyer magazine.

	Nicaraguan Volcano Dumps Ash  
</P>
<P>
	MALPAISILLO, Nicaragua (AP) -- Covering their heads to protect  
themselves from falling ash, hundreds of people fled from towns 
near the Cerro Negro volcano as the government declared a state of 
maximum alert Friday. A maximum alert was declared on the 
recommendation of the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies. 
The institute said more than 200 volcanic earthquakes have been 
recorded in the area in the last three days.

<P>
	DULLES, Va. (AP) -- America Online Inc. will make its Instant  
Messenger service easily available to the 2.5 million customers of 
two smaller Internet access services, further defying Microsoft 
Corp.'s attempt to crack AOL's lock on the market for real-time 
notes. The move Friday drew a sharp reaction from Microsoft, which 
is promoting its own instant messaging service but has been 
rebuffed so far in getting AOL to let customers of both services 
exchange messages.

	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Troy O'Leary went 4-for-5 with a home run  
and three RBIs, and Bret Saberhagen won his fourth straight road 
decision as the Boston Red Sox beat the Anaheim Angels 5-1 Friday 
night. Saberhagen (7-4) pitched five innings, allowing a run and 
six hits with a season-high seven strikeouts. The only run came in 
the fourth, when he issued his only two walks with one out and 
Steve Decker followed with a double between first baseman Mike 
Stanley and the bag.

<HEADLINE> Senate Moves To Ease Cuban Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cuba would be allowed to buy U.S. food and  
medical supplies if the House goes along with a provision the 
Senate put in an Agriculture Department spending bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration recently decided to allow sales of  
food and medicine to three other countries listed as terrorist 
states, Iran, Libya and Sudan, but was barred from including Cuba 
by federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate provision allows the government to issues licenses  
for up to one year for food and medicine sales to public 
institutions in Cuba but bars the sales from being subsidized. The 
legislation also prohibits a president from including food and 
medicine in future embargoes without congressional approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think markets like Cuba show large potential, especially  
for wheat and rice. We don't see any reason why we shouldn't be 
allowed to sell to them,'' Wayne Hammon of the National Association 
of Wheat Growers said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a triumph for the American farmer, the people of Cuba  
and common sense, and restores U.S. policy to the moral high 
ground,'' said Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar measures have been rejected in House committees, and the  
House has no such provision in its version of the agriculture bill. 
A House-Senate conference committee will work out the differences 
between the two bills. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has not taken a position on the Cuba  
measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba is buying about $90 million worth of wheat this year,  
mostly from Australia and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has said he has no intention of lifting the  
trade embargo, which has been in place since shortly after Fidel 
Castro's communist government took over Cuba in 1959. Congress 
strengthened the embargo in 1996 with the Helms-Burton law.

<HEADLINE> Busy Hurricane Season Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT COLLINS, Colo. (AP) -- Despite a slow start, this still  
could be a busy hurricane season, a prominent forecaster says. 
</P>
<P>
	In his final update for the season, which runs from June 1 to  
Nov. 30, William Gray of Colorado State University predicted there 
will be 14 named storms, nine hurricanes and four intense 
hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray's research team said there is a 54 percent chance at least  
one storm will make landfall along the East Coast. The Gulf Coast 
has a 40 percent chance of being hit, the team said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray said this season will be similar to last year, when there  
were 14 tropical storms, 10 hurricanes and three intense 
hurricanes. It is not unusual for there to be no hurricanes until 
mid- or late August. 
</P>
<P>
	``People should not be lulled into thinking that because we've  
had a rather slow start to the season that we're going to get a 
slow season,'' Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one named storm, Arlene, has formed so far.  
</P>
<P>
	Gray's forecasts have proved close to the mark most years and  
are taken seriously by officials.

<HEADLINE> Agents Complain About Internet Fares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Travel agents want the Transportation  
Department to investigate popular airfare specials offered by 
airlines on the Internet, saying they discriminate against those 
who do not have computer hookups. 
</P>
<P>
	Such fares ``might be good for consumers, but the fact is ...  
these `benefits' are available only to the elite of customers who 
have access to the Internet,'' Joe Galloway, president of the 
American Society of Travel Agents, wrote Thursday in a letter to 
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater. 
</P>
<P>
	The society cited a Commerce Department study released last  
month that outlined an ever-widening ``digital divide'' between 
those with Internet access and those without, many of whom are 
black and Hispanic. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rest of society is excluded from access to the lowest  
airfares and the gap between those who can get them and those who 
cannot is widening,'' Galloway wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Travel agents increasingly are concerned about the public's use  
of the Internet to buy tickets because consumers can bypass the 
agents and deal directly with the airlines. Travel agents typically 
are paid a percentage of each ticket they sell, although airlines 
also have been cutting back their fees in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, consumers purchasing tickets online are  
finding the major U.S. airlines are offering special low fares and 
benefits such as extra frequent flier miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Further pressuring the industry is the exploding popularity of  
online travel agencies, such as Travelocity, which is closely 
affiliated with American Airlines, and Microsoft's Expedia. 
</P>
<P>
	Using those services, passengers can hook into computer  
reservation systems and shop for the cheapest airfare, again 
bypassing travel agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Travelocity has gross sales of more than $128 million for the  
first quarter of this year -- a 156 percent increase over the same 
period last year. The site also registered 1.2 million new members 
during the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Travel agents contend they offer passengers better service than  
the airlines or Internet services and that through their contacts 
and expertise, they are more likely than others to find the 
cheapest airfare available. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Society of Travel Agents, the world's largest  
travel trade association, asked the Transportation Department to 
investigate Internet fare wars ``to determine whether they 
constitute unfair and deceptive competitive practices under the 
Federal Aviation Act by discriminating against `unwired' 
consumers,'' the society said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Transportation Department typically reviews such letters  
before issuing a response. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Transport Association, a trade group representing the  
nation's major airlines, dismissed the criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet is a new mode of mass commerce and the airlines,  
like other industries, are looking to find the best way to use that 
to add to our business,'' said David Fuscus, the association's 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	``The baseline issue here is they're worried about their  
revenues. This is just an attempt by them to disparage Internet 
sales when Internet sales are definitely something that benefit the 
consumer,'' he added.

<HEADLINE> Doctors Happy McGwire Drops Andro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Now that Mark McGwire has joined the elite 500-homer club after  
saying no to andro, doctors are hoping sales of the supplement will 
slide. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message Mark McGwire sends to our young people by walking  
away from this substance is a powerful one,'' Barry R. McCaffrey, 
the White House drug policy director, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all need to be aware that just because a superstar stops  
using andro, the problem doesn't just go away. Countless young 
people still take this potentially dangerous substance -- banned by 
the NFL, the Olympics, the NCAA and professional tennis -- in order 
to improve their athletic performance. We must continue to focus on 
the risks at hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the year that has passed since The Associated Press reported  
that McGwire was using androstenedione during his 70-homer season, 
sales of the testosterone booster surged more than 1,000 percent to 
more than $50 million, according to industry figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Easy access to the over-the-counter supplement through the  
Internet and nutrition stores worried doctors that thousands of 
young people might be risking long-term illness. Andro 
manufacturers say more than 100 players in the majors and minors 
are using the supplement, which converts to testosterone in the 
body and is considered an anabolic steroid by most steroid 
specialists. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire said he was unhappy being cast as the poster boy for  
andro, even though he wasn't breaking any baseball rules. He said 
he hasn't used andro in four months, and will never again take it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still believe there's nothing wrong with it,'' he said in  
St. Louis before hitting homers No. 500 and 501. ``But if I have a 
message for kids, it's that you don't necessarily have to follow 
what somebody who's in the public eye does. If you're an adult, you 
elect to choose your own destiny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire didn't explain why he waited four months to say he was  
dropping andro if he wanted to send out the message to youngsters. 
When he arrived in spring training, he adamantly said he would 
continue using the supplement. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's four months' worth of kids who took andro because of  
him,'' said Dr. Gary Wadler, a leading steroid specialist at NYU 
Medical School and a consultant to several professional sports. 
``I'm delighted he said it today, rather than never saying it at 
all, but I would have preferred he said it at the beginning of the 
season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Wade Exum, head of the U.S. Olympic Committee's drug control  
program, also applauded McGwire's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's great,'' Exum said. ``I can't say it'll help  
tremendously because it's somewhat after the fact. But if he's not 
using the stuff, and he's still having a hell of a season, then 
maybe the message will counterbalance some of the things that went 
on last year. The problem is, after last year, the sales of that 
stuff jumped. All you can do now is follow the sales and see if 
they go down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's use of andro through the winter and spring training,  
though, may have given him a competitive edge that would help him 
during the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the whole basis for year-round, out-of-competition  
testing,'' Wadler said. ``People in other sports were very savvy to 
announced drug testing, so what they did was take a lot of this 
stuff, bulk up, and when the season started they stopped. They 
continued to work out and derive much of the benefit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An Iowa State study of andro published a few months ago showed  
that in small doses, andro didn't increase strength, but still 
might lead to heart disease and other health problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem with that study is that is not how people tend to  
use these things,'' Wadler said. ``They usually take many multiples 
of the recommended daily dose, 10 to 100 times what's on the label. 
Anybody who thinks people taking andro with the eye toward 
improving performance or developing musculature are not taking 
multiples is kind of putting their head in the sand. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he took a lot, and he took it many times a day, and he did  
it for a long time, he could derive the benefits, which is 
increased muscle mass in conjunction with weightlifting, and he 
could have a carryover through the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bigger problem for baseball, Wadler said, is the issue of  
whether andro is just a tiny part of anabolic steroid use. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time now for baseball to step up to the plate. Baseball  
needs to get its act together and stop nipping around the edges. It 
has to get to the heart of the matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That, Wadler said, involves banning andro and similar  
substances, and testing for the whole range of anabolic steroids. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do I think baseball has steroid abuse in it? If it didn't, it  
would be the first sport that we know of at a high level where 
there was no steroid use,'' Wadler said. ``There may not be a whole 
lot of people, but to think they're immune from the behaviors that 
we see in all kinds of other sports is the ultimate of naivete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, neither baseball commissioner Bud Selig nor union  
officials have shown a willingness yet to ban andro or test for 
anabolic steroids. A Harvard study of andro, commissioned by 
baseball, is still months from release, and no decision is expected 
before that. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig on Wednesday declined to talk about McGwire's decision,  
but NL president Len Coleman praised the Cardinals' first baseman's 
act. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mark's focus is on contributions to society,'' Coleman said.  
``He leads by example. The youth of the world are well served by 
Mark's value structure.''

<HEADLINE> Fla. Cop Charged in Suspect Beating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE WORTH, Fla. (AP) -- An attorney for a police officer who was  
videotaped as he beat a handcuffed suspect with a baton at least 16 
times said the officer's actions were justified. 
</P>
<P>
	Officer Stephen Danner, 33, was placed on paid administrative  
leave after he was charged with battery in the Dec. 7 assault on 
David Weiler, police Chief William Smith said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The videotape shows Danner repeatedly swinging his baton with  
two hands over his head and down to the ground, presumably where 
Weiler was lying handcuffed. A hedge partially blocks the view, so 
Weiler's body is not seen. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Scott Richardson said Danner was doing what needed to  
be done to control the man. 
</P>
<P>
	``When all the facts are presented, we'll be able to show  
Officer Danner did not have any criminal intent to commit a crime 
but was simply doing what he needed to do to secure this 
individual,'' Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Smith said he knew from the moment he saw the video that  
Danner had crossed the line. 
</P>
<P>
	``My first reaction was I was shocked,'' he said. ``And I  
recognized the use of force was inappropriate for the 
circumstances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police were called to a residential neighborhood about a  
bothersome stranger. The videotape, which was mailed anonymously to 
city hall two months after the incident, shows a shirtless Weiler 
wandering through yards and driveways, seemingly mumbling to 
himself as he struggles to buckle the belt on his baggy jeans. The 
tape has no audio. 
</P>
<P>
	According to an internal affairs report, Weiler, 19, was  
handcuffed without incident by two officers, but then refused to 
get into a patrol car. The tape shows Danner, who arrived after the 
first two officers, spraying Weiler in the face and on the back of 
the head with pepper spray as he tried to wiggle away from 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
	He then forced Weiler to the ground and struck him at least 16  
times with his baton. Weiler suffered bruises but otherwise was 
unharmed, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tape was mailed along with an anonymous letter to city hall  
and eventually was turned over to Smith. The two other officers 
involved were not charged and remain on active duty. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, the investigation was turned over to prosecutors, who  
charged Danner on Wednesday with battery. The misdemeanor could 
bring a year of probation and a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	An internal affairs report recommended he be removed from the  
force for violating rules on use of force and unsatisfactory 
performance of his duties.

<HEADLINE> Ore. Reactor Heads for Burial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAINIER, Ore. (AP) -- Entombed in concrete and 6-inch steel, the  
radioactive reactor of the largest U.S. nuclear power plant ever to 
be shut down was loaded onto a barge Friday for a 270-mile river 
journey right through the heart of Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the first time a commercial reactor of this size -- and  
level of contamination -- will pass through a major American city, 
according to officials at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the 
agency overseeing the decommissioning of the Trojan Nuclear Plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the utility that owns the reactor, which is headed for  
burial 45 feet deep on the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in 
Washington, considered the river journey risky, and 
environmentalists were worried. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not saying if the reactor falls off into the water,  
everybody would have to be evacuated from Portland, but it would 
not be good for the Columbia River to have a reactor vessel sitting 
in it,'' said Lloyd Marbet, who led three unsuccessful ballot 
initiatives to have the plant shut down. ``The fact of the matter 
is that the interior of the vessel contains a very high level of 
radioactivity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moving the 1,000-ton reactor is contentious because  
environmentalists had urged the plant's owner, Portland General 
Electric, to mothball the entire site for at least 50 years and 
wait for the radioactive isotopes to cool down before dismantling 
the facility. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, PGE opted to barge the reactor vessel from its current  
site, 42 miles northwest of Portland on the banks of the Columbia 
River, to the Hanford Nuclear Reservation. Before moving the 
towering, dumbbell-shaped object, it was shrink-wrapped in blue 
plastic and plastered with a sign reading ``Radioactive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chugging along no faster than 12 mph, a tug was to take the  
barge past Portland by early Saturday and continue upstream until 
it reaches Benton, Wash., sometime Sunday. From there, two trucks 
creeping along at 5 mph will pull the vessel on a 320-wheel, 
16-axle trailer to Hanford, 30 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	Utility officials say barging the leakproof reactor is the  
safest way to decommission the plant, which for 16 years generated 
enough electricity to power all of Portland. It was closed in 1993, 
two decades earlier than planned, after a series of problems, 
including a faulty safety system that drew federal fines, the 
accidental release of radioactive gases and cracked steam tubes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would characterize it as a risky move, but it's a lot safer  
than the traditional method of cutting the reactor into pieces and 
trucking it over the highway,'' PGE spokesman Kregg Arntson said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, a train hauled away the reactor vessel of the Yankee  
Rowe nuclear plant in Massachusetts, but unlike Trojan, it weighed 
only 360 tons and was not transported through heavily populated 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Portland General Electric already has shipped off Trojan's  
contaminated steam generators in five trips to Hanford since 1995, 
and the Navy has long shipped old reactors from submarines and 
cruisers up the Columbia for burial at the site -- all without any 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The only difference is that the Trojan reactor contains 15 times  
as much radioactivity as those objects, according to state 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Arntson said the vessel poses little risk to the workers  
handling it or residents living along the river, once it is encased 
in concrete. A person standing within six feet of the reactor for 
an hour would receive no more radiation than an airplane passenger 
would get from the sun during two cross-country flights, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A potentially more dangerous problem remains at the Trojan site:  
hundreds of highly radioactive spent fuel rods. Since the federal 
government has yet to build a disposal site for such waste, PGE has 
no option but to encase the rods in canisters and leave them there.

	The broadcasters honored Witt, director of the Federal Emergency  
Management Agency, for his contributions to emergency services both 
in Arkansas and nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Witt, who directed the Arkansas Office of Emergency Services  
when Clinton was governor, is among those said to harbor 
gubernatorial aspirations here. Clinton played to that speculation, 
saying there is hardly a public official ``who can even remotely 
equal'' Witt's record of helping Americans through weather crises.

	``He has served America well, and he has done Arkansas proud,''

	Clinton planned to spend Saturday visiting the Delta town of  
Helena and helping raise funds for Vice President Al Gore's 
presidential bid.

<HEADLINE> Hearst Buys San Francisco Chronicle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The Hearst Corp., publisher of the San  
Francisco Examiner, said today it has bought the rival San 
Francisco Chronicle from the family that has owned the newspaper 
since its inception 134 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost of the purchase was not disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	John Sias, the president of Chronicle Publishing Co., said  
Chronicle employees' jobs would be maintained under existing union 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	The heirs of the De Young family, which has owned the Chronicle  
since it began, decided to put it on the market two months ago. 
Under a joint operating agreement with the Examiner, the privately 
held Hearst had the right to match any offer for the Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearst also said it will seek a buyer for the Examiner, the  
city's afternoon newspaper, which has been published under the 
joint operating agreement with the morning Chronicle since 1965. If 
a buyer is not found, Hearst said it would combine the two papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearst is also acquiring the SF Gate Web site, which publishes  
the content of both newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sias and Frank A. Bennack Jr., president and chief executive of  
the Hearst Corp., said in a statement that they had informed the 
Justice Department's antitrust division of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chronicle Publishing Co.'s board of directors voted in June  
to explore a sale of its holdings, including the San Francisco 
Chronicle, the nation's 11th-largest newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Chronicle Publishing also owns the Bloomington Pantagraph in  
Illinois and the Worcester Telegram &AMP; Gazette in Massachusetts. It 
owns TV stations KRON, San Francisco's NBC affiliate; KAKE in 
Wichita, Kan.; and WOWT in Omaha, Neb., and two book publishing 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	One media consultant estimated in May that the San Francisco  
Chronicle alone could fetch $400 million to $1 billion or more, 
based on the paper's circulation of 482,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Chronicle Publishing is owned by the descendants of M.H. de  
Young, who founded the newspaper with his brother in 1865. The 
board has five family members and five outside directors.

<HEADLINE> Robert Downey Jr. Gets Three Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MALIBU, Calif. (AP) -- Robert Downey Jr., the Oscar-nominated  
actor plagued by addictions to alcohol, cocaine and heroin, was 
sentenced to three years in prison for violating probation from a 
1996 drug conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Downey, 34, was jailed six weeks ago after he admitted during  
his regular half-yearly visit to court that he was missing 
scheduled drug tests. 
</P>
<P>
	The actor, clean-shaven with slicked back hair, walked into  
court Thursday in an orange Los Angeles County jail jumpsuit. He 
asked the judge to keep him on probation so he could continue 
treatment at a drug rehabilitation center called Impact. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been the right program at the right time for me,'' he  
said haltingly. ``I feel whatever decision you make will be the 
right one. ... But I feel a transition has happened to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of his addiction, Downey explained: ``It's like I've got a  
shotgun in my mouth, with my finger on the trigger, and I like the 
taste of the gun metal,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Municipal Court Judge Lawrence Mira, who presided over  
Downey's original case in 1996, said he had given the actor many 
chances to rehabilitate himself, noting he has been represented 
over the years by ``a virtual who's who of the defense bar in Los 
Angeles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, the judge added, Downey has manipulated doctors and  
psychiatrists during seven court-ordered drug rehabilitation 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we have any alternative,'' the judge said. ``We  
have used them all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge gave Downey 201 days for time served and ordered him  
to pay restitution of $600. Attorneys said he would probably serve 
about a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Downey nodded to several friends as he was led out of the  
courtroom in handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Robert Shapiro argued that Downey should again  
receive probation and be allowed to continue treatment at a drug 
treatment center. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a person who is suffering from a disease he can't  
control. ... Even the dire threat of jail or prison is not enough 
of a deterrent,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am shocked and saddened by the sentence today,'' Shapiro  
told reporters outside court. ``It is wrong, it does not serve 
justice. Mr. Downey was on the road to recovery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shapiro said he would appeal, but acknowledged ``appealing  
sentences in cases like this, in all candor, is very difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The son of film director Robert Downey won an Oscar bid for his  
work in the title role in ``Chaplin,'' the 1992 screen biography of 
the famed comedian. Other film credits include ``Less Than Zero,'' 
``Natural Born Killers,'' ``One Night Stand,'' ``Two Girls and a 
Guy'' and ``U.S. Marshals.'' He also appears in the movie 
``Bowfinger'' to be released later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The actor's legal troubles date to June 1996 when he was stopped  
for speeding and authorities found cocaine, heroin and an unloaded 
pistol in his vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	He was sentenced to three years' probation after pleading  
no-contest to drug and weapons charges. Despite stints in recovery, 
probation was revoked because of drug use and he was sentenced to 
six months in jail. He was released in March 1998 after serving 113 
days.

<HEADLINE> McGwire Hits 500th Home Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire needed one homer and got two to  
finish the night with 501 homers. Tony Gwynn needed two hits and 
got one, leaving him with 2,999 hits. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire reached the 500 plateau with fewer at-bats than anyone  
in baseball history, then hit No. 501 off the left-field scoreboard 
Thursday night in a 10-3 loss to the San Diego Padres on Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's incredible,'' Padres manager Bruce Bochy said. ``It's  
like he's allergic to a base hit, too. I mean, the ball's leaving 
the park every time he hits it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire made it to 500 in 5,487 at-bats, obliterating Babe  
Ruth's record of 5,801. The others in the top five are Harmon 
Killebrew (6,671), Jimmie Foxx (7,074) and Mickey Mantle (7,300). 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm well aware of the names,'' McGwire said. ``It's sort of  
odd to have your name with that group because I feel like I have a 
few years to play. I'm not done playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While McGwire became the 16th member of the 500-homer club,  
Gwynn fell just short of becoming the 22nd player to reach 3,000 
hits. Gwynn got No. 2,999 -- a two-run double in the ninth inning -- 
and went 1-for-4 with a walk as a sellout crowd just missed a 
double dose of history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I gave it a good run,'' Gwynn said. ``I'll move on to the next  
stop, and hopefully I can get it there tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres begin a four-game series at Montreal tonight.  
</P>
<P>
	Never before have two players had a chance to reach such lofty  
milestones in the same game. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people of all America got to see what they wanted to see  
and plus one,'' said Padres right-hander Andy Ashby, who gave up 
both homers. ``It would have been nice if Tony would have gotten 
his 3,000th, but we'll have to wait another day for that, or 
whenever it comes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Gwynn: ``I gave it a good run.''  
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of 45,106, some of whom paid $150 to scalpers for a $7  
standing room ticket, came away happy. After just missing in his 
first at-bat with a drive to the center-field wall, McGwire hit a 
hanging breaking ball an estimated 451 feet to straightaway center 
in the third, then blasted a 479-foot shot off the scoreboard in 
left-center in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've exceeded everything I expected of myself,'' McGwire said  
after the game. ``Growing up as a kid, you don't think about things 
like that. At least I didn't. You just think about playing ball in 
your yard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's fifth multihomer game of the season and the 58th of  
his career came in the same ballpark where he broke Roger Maris' 
37-year-old homer record last Sept. 8 when he hit No. 62. McGwire 
went on to finish with 70, ahead of Sosa's 66 in a duel that 
captivated the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire remains a bit off last year's pace, even after hitting  
17 homers in 21 games, but he's catching up in a hurry. Now he's on 
pace for 65. 
</P>
<P>
	After rounding the bases on No. 500, McGwire jumped on home  
plate with both feet before being greeted by teammates, who 
exchanged his signature fake gut punches along with high-fives. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who hit his 499th homer Wednesday night, then took his  
second curtain call in as many nights as Ashby stood off the mound, 
looking out towards center field. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn took off his glove in right field and applauded as McGwire  
rounded the bases. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm wondering, `Should I clap like everybody else or be a  
professional?''' Gwynn said. ``Really, this is his stage, his 
ballpark. Once again, he delivered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's eighth-inning blast was the longest this season at  
Busch, banging off the scoreboard near his No. 25 in a lineup list 
before dropping into the seats right above the Padres bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire leads the majors with 44 home runs, two more than Sammy  
Sosa, and tops the NL with 101 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts believe the 500th homer ball could be worth $1 million,  
and fans scrambled to come up with the prize after it deflected off 
the base of an advertisement and landed in an area of shrubbery 
beyond the center-field wall. Jim Shearer, a 28-year-old architect 
from St. Louis, wound up with the souvenir and was whisked away by 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Shearer said he'd think about what he might do with the ball for  
a few days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been hearing that it's worth a lot of money,'' Shearer  
said. ``But I have to remember it's a piece of baseball history for 
Mark McGwire and St. Louis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fan who caught McGwire's 70th homer ball, Phil Ozersky of  
St. Louis, sold it to Spawn comic book creator Todd McFarlane for 
$3.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who hit his 400th home run last season, couldn't have  
had a much better foil for his 500th. He's 8-for-16 with four 
homers and four doubles against Ashby, who congratulated him after 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, I gave up 500, so I may as well give up 501, too,''  
Ashby said. ``It's one of them things. Just thank God it wasn't 
enough to beat us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire has reached his last four big milestones, starting with  
Nos. 61, 62 and 70 last year, in front of the home fans. He wanted 
to hit No. 500 in St. Louis, too, and did it just in time -- the 
Cardinals begin a trip Friday with a doubleheader at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire also homered in his first home game after joining the  
Cardinals after the 1997 trade deadline, and in the first game 
after signing a three-year, $28.5-million deal later that year. 
That's not to mention the five homers he hit in the last three days 
of last season to pull away from Sosa. 
</P>
<P>
	``You figure out how great he is to be able to do it,'' manager  
Tony La Russa said. 
</P>
<P>
	The last player to reach 500 homers was Eddie Murray on Sept. 6,  
1996, at Baltimore against Detroit's Felipe Lira. Murray is 15th on 
the career list with 504. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire has already passed five players on the list this season  
-- Lou Gehrig (493), Stan Musial and Willie Stargell (475) and Dave 
Winfield (465). 
</P>
<P>
	Musial was at Busch Stadium for the big night and sat next to  
fellow Cardinals Hall of Famer Lou Brock, the last NL player to 
reach 3,000 hits. 
</P>
<P>
	At 35, McGwire is a year older than Ruth was when he reached  
500. He's had to make up for lost time after totaling 18 home runs 
in injury-plagued 1993 and '94 seasons for Oakland, and the homer 
put him on pace to hit 64 this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby (10-5) allowed three runs on five hits in 7 2-3 innings,  
and Trevor Hoffman finished for his 27th save. Chris Gomez and 
Hoffman drove in two runs apiece for the Padres, who won for only 
the second time in 14 games and avoided a four-game sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinals starter Larry Luebbers (1-2) lasted five innings and  
gave up four runs on five hits. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Gwynn will get his chance to become the 22nd member of the  
3,000-hit club at Montreal tonight. Dan Smith starts for the Expos. 
... Cardinals pitcher Alan Benes made his first injury rehab start 
for Double-A Arkansas and worked 1 1-3 scoreless innings against 
Shreveport, throwing 28 pitches.

<HEADLINE> Pataki Backs Giuliani for Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In a move that could defuse a nasty primary  
fight, Gov. George Pataki endorsed Mayor Rudolph Giuliani for the 
Senate on Friday and asked Rep. Rick Lazio to defer his decision on 
whether to enter the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``In order to win, the Republican Party must be unified behind  
one strong candidate. I believe that Rudy Giuliani has earned the 
right to be that candidate,'' Pataki said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the expected Democratic nominee, first lady Hillary  
Rodham Clinton, met with the leader of the state's Independence 
Party to explore the possibility of getting its endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani, who has had a contentious relationship with the  
governor, was noticeably absent from Pataki's news conference. But 
he issued a statement saying, ``I very much appreciate Gov. George 
Pataki's strong words of support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A GOP primary fight between Giuliani and Lazio could deplete GOP  
funds and leave the winner vulnerable Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, a unified Republican Party could hurt Mrs. Clinton.  
The first lady, exploring a Senate bid, is not expected to have any 
opposition for the Democratic nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the Republicans do or don't do is up to them. Mrs.  
Clinton is going to continue focusing on issues and listening to 
New Yorkers,'' said Howard Wolfson, spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's 
exploratory committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani, who has not yet announced whether he will run, also  
got the endorsement Friday of former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato. Like 
Pataki, D'Amato also has been at odds with Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki's backing came in a brief statement in which he saved his  
most glowing words for Lazio. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rick Lazio is an outstanding congressman who is a rising star  
in our party. ... Rick Lazio would be a very strong candidate,'' 
Pataki said. ``Nevertheless, I have asked Congressman Lazio to 
defer his announcement and await the mayor's decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lazio, who could not immediately be reached for comment Friday,  
has said he would not run if Pataki asked him to bow out of the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he held any lingering resentment toward Giuliani, who  
had endorsed Mario Cuomo for governor over Pataki, the governor 
said, ``Obviously it was a disappointment, but you can't look 
backward. You have to look forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani is widely expected to run for the Senate, as is Mrs.  
Clinton who has been traveling the state in an effort to overcome 
the ``carpetbagger'' charge leveled against her. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaigning in Rochester, Mrs. Clinton said her planned  
summer-long ``listening tour'' of New York could extend well into 
the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	She called for a common standard for coverage of political  
candidates that does not invade their privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it serves our nation or our political process  
well for people to have every shred of privacy taken away from 
them,'' she said. ``I don't think that's good and I'm speaking as 
someone who's been through it, so I have some experience in that 
regard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton met privately for half an hour with Rochester  
businessman B. Thomas Golisano, leader of the Ross Perot-inspired 
Independence Party in New York. Golisano said they talked about the 
possibility of her securing its nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told her this is a process and that we're a long ways away  
from that point and encouraged her to keep the lines of 
communication open, and to be open and honest with us on issues so 
we can make a responsible decision,'' Golisano said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the Independence Party's backing of Democrat Charles  
Schumer was considered a factor in his victory over Republican 
incumbent Sen. Alfonse D'Amato. 
</P>
<P>
	At his news conference, Pataki was asked why he didn't endorse  
Giuliani earlier. ``I was waiting until the end of the legislative 
session, but I've thought for some time that this was the right 
decision,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he wanted to be sure his announcement came before  
Lazio's planned entry into the race the week of Aug. 16. ``I wanted 
to make sure my position was known to him and to the others within 
this state prior to his making that determination,'' Pataki said. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor told reporters that he spoke to both Giuliani and  
Lazio before making his announcement and that D'Amato was aware of 
his position. 
</P>
<P>
	``I agree with the governor's decision that Rudy Giuliani has  
earned the right to be our party's nominee,'' D'Amato said in a 
statement. ``I am certain that if he runs he will have my support 
and the overwhelming support of the Republican Party throughout the 
state. I urge the mayor to get into the race soon and unify the 
Republican Party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several Republican leaders, including state Senate Majority  
Leader Joseph Bruno and Staten Island Borough President Guy 
Molinari, had encouraged Lazio not to run against Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	``A bloody primary obviously would be very costly,'' Molinari  
said.

<HEADLINE> Nixon's Decline Remembered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Time stopped for Richard Nixon 25 years ago.  
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Aug. 9, 1974, the day he would go down in history as  
the only president to resign, Nixon awoke about 6 a.m. But he 
thought it was 4 a.m. because his watch had quit and heavy curtains 
blacked out the dawn. 
</P>
<P>
	He threw on a bathrobe and padded off to the White House kitchen  
to fix breakfast. Surprised to see the cook so early, he ordered up 
corned beef hash and poached eggs, comfort food more substantial 
than his usual wheat germ and milk. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander Haig, his chief of staff, arrived and handed him a  
sheet of paper prepared for his signature. ``I hereby resign the 
Office of President of the United States,'' it said. He signed. It 
was as if the clock had started ticking again. 
</P>
<P>
	A maudlin speech to staff -- ``My mother was a saint,'' he said --  
and soon he was gone. Just after noon, Gerald R. Ford was sworn in 
as president as Nixon flew to his California sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
	It is hard to imagine how Nixon could get out of bed in those  
last days of his presidency. Each day was grimmer than the day 
before, each event a tumble off yet another precipice. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a man awake during his own nightmare,'' Henry Kissinger  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the quarter-century since that bad dream for the nation and  
Nixon, two things have been said about Watergate that together 
sound like a paradox. 
</P>
<P>
	One is that ``the system worked,'' that in the cauldron of  
corruption stirred at the highest level of power, a democracy's 
resilience, its ability to use law and process to right itself, won 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	The other is that faith in government has never been the same.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were awakened and became watchful and cynical,'' says Sam  
Dash, chief counsel of the Senate Watergate Committee. ``We 
suddenly saw what a president can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watergate ushered in a powerful urge to do things clean and  
right. Ethics were in. The ``imperial presidency'' was out. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the reforms have held up better than others.  
</P>
<P>
	A new openness came to campaigns and government, with agencies  
forced to live by new rules overseen by ethics officials. The flow 
of campaign money was made more transparent. Those steps and others 
survive. 
</P>
<P>
	But the independent counsel statute, designed to insulate  
official investigations from politics, recently died, judged after 
President Clinton's long and lurid impeachment ordeal to be too 
loose a cannon. 
</P>
<P>
	And the effort to keep campaign financing honest has grown  
rickety at best. Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor martyred 
when Nixon fired him, says today's ``money-mad politics'' may be an 
evil worse than Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal, at the outset, was about the break-in on June 17,  
1972, at national Democratic headquarters by burglars working for 
the Committee to Re-elect the President and efforts to conceal 
White House involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigations, official and by the press, uncovered a rash of  
political espionage operations and dirty tricks against Nixon's 
opponents and -- ultimately and most damning -- the president's role 
in trying to cover them up. 
</P>
<P>
	The final weeks were tumultuous in Washington. The impossible  
became the seemingly inevitable -- the first and only presidency 
ending under threat of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Crowds gathered outside the iron bars of the White House to  
jeer, ``Jail to the chief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Worries about Nixon's stability prompted private assurances from  
aides that if ``the president picks up a red phone, nobody will 
answer it,'' Philip Lacovara, then deputy solicitor general, said. 
Haig, however, insists Nixon, although distraught, was in firm 
control of his senses and responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Nixon spent part of that time in California, swimming in the  
Pacific, tinkering with an anti-inflation plan and continually 
reviewing the arithmetic of his political fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
	It was an exercise in subtraction, as more and more loyalists in  
Congress turned against him. On July 21, he learned three 
previously sympathetic Southern Democrats on the Judiciary 
Committee were deserting him. He wrote in his diary: ``12:01 a.m.: 
Lowest point in Presidency and SC to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``SC'' was the Supreme Court. Three days later it ruled  
unanimously he had to surrender tapes wanted by Watergate 
investigators, tapes he realized would likely doom him. Nixon's 
presidency sank lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Three days after that, on July 27, lower still, as the Judiciary  
Committee passed the first article of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	After three more days, when the third impeachment article had  
passed the committee, Nixon got up in the middle of the night and 
began listing the pros and cons of resigning. Near dawn, he 
concluded: ``End career as a fighter.'' Still he would continue to 
show flashes of defiance. 
</P>
<P>
	Nixon had taken to musing to associates that the ``best  
political writing in this century has been done from jail.'' He 
mentioned Lenin and Gandhi. 
</P>
<P>
	It got worse.  
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Aug. 5, his hand forced, he released a transcript of  
one of the surrendered tapes. Therein lay the ``smoking gun,'' 
proof that six days after the Watergate break-in, he had tried to 
get the CIA to stop the FBI investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Nixon took his family for an evening dinner cruise on the  
Potomac on the presidential yacht Sequoia. He didn't want them 
watching the news. Reporters and photographers hung over bridges 
for a look or picture. 
</P>
<P>
	His remaining support melted. Longtime ally Rep. Charles  
Wiggins, R-Calif., dismay written across his face, declared: ``The 
magnificent career of public service of Richard Nixon must be 
terminated involuntarily.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A delegation of GOP Sens. Barry Goldwater of Arizona and Hugh  
Scott of Pennsylvania and House Republican leader John Rhodes of 
Arizona, met him that Wednesday, two days before the end. They told 
him it was grim -- if the full House impeached Nixon, the Senate 
would vote to convict him, removing him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Nixon told his family he was quitting. The Nixons mopped up  
tears to pose and force a smile for the official White House 
photographer, himself crying. 
</P>
<P>
	Later that night, Nixon and Kissinger, his secretary of state,  
broke out brandy they had opened three years earlier to toast the 
president's invitation to visit China. They talked. Nixon had 
Kissinger kneel with him in the Lincoln Bedroom and pray. 
</P>
<P>
	``A President's power begins slipping away the moment it is  
known that he is going to leave,'' Nixon wrote in the memoirs where 
he also recalled his last White House breakfast. ``My telephone 
calls and meetings and decisions were now parts of a prescribed 
ritual aimed at making peace with the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Aug. 8, Nixon met Ford, then congressional leaders,  
then several dozen loyalists, many sobbing. He was in tears, too. 
Then he faced the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to  
every instinct in my body,'' he said in his TV address. ``But as 
president, I must put the interests of America first. ... 
Therefore, I shall resign the presidency effective at noon 
tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said: ``I regret deeply any injuries that may have been done  
in the course of the events that led to this decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He never admitted a damn thing,'' said John Dean, former Nixon  
counsel and one of 25 men who went to prison for Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington National Cathedral kept its chapel open late that  
evening for citizens who might want to come and pray. Few did. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our long national nightmare is over,'' asserted Ford, upon  
becoming president the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	In all American history, eight presidents had died in office.  
None had quit. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford later pardoned Nixon, who went on to write memoirs and  
respected foreign policy books. Future presidents, including 
Clinton, came to value his counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	He died April 22, 1994, at age 81.  
</P>
<P>
	``Power to Nixon was manipulation, inside information, polls,  
favors, tradeoffs, bribes, public relations, smears and 
intimidation,'' historian Stephen E. Ambrose writes at the end of 
his three-volume Nixon biography. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Ambrose said that because Nixon quit, his proposal to ensure  
everyone had health insurance died. Tensions with the Soviet Union 
that he had eased dragged on. An opening to China was left 
unexploited. Massive deficits followed. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Nixon resigned,'' he argued, ``we lost more than we  
gained.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The aura of the presidency and perhaps some of its power were  
diminished. Congress and the Supreme Court weakened a president's 
ability to stonewall and claim executive privilege. 
</P>
<P>
	``Watergate taught the American people they can't sit on their  
hands and trust the government,'' Sam Dash says. The way he sees it 
now, everyone wised up.

<HEADLINE> Kidd Expects Benefits From Penny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Nobody pushed harder for the Penny Hardaway trade  
than Jason Kidd. It's likely no one will benefit more from 
Hardaway's move to Phoenix than Kidd, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jason does not have to carry the full burden that he did last  
year,'' Suns coach Danny Ainge said. ``Last year, Jason had to 
create the offense for himself and everybody else. Penny is a guy 
you can go to down the stretch. He creates double teams. They 
complement each other very well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kidd was on the phone once or twice a week to Hardaway,  
explaining how the two could form one of the NBA's great 
backcourts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jason, he did a great job,'' Hardaway said. ``Like they said,  
he was the assistant general manager. He called me all the time. 
When he was in Puerto Rico (with the U.S. team), he was calling. He 
never pressured me to make a decision, but he just said he'd love 
to have me and he'd love to play with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, it often seemed that the always energized Kidd was  
playing the game at one pace, while the rest of the Suns were at 
another. Those around him couldn't keep up with a player Hardaway 
calls ``by far the best point guard in the NBA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway says he can keep up.  
</P>
<P>
	``All I have to do is run, he's going to find me,'' Hardaway  
said. ``I know that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Hardaway standing 6-foot-7 and Kidd 6-4, the backcourt is  
one of the NBA's biggest, and that means big matchup problems for 
the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look at his game and my game, they're really very  
similar,'' Kidd said. ``It will be very difficult for other teams 
to match up with us. It will help me in a big way that he's 6-7, 
because now they have to put the two guard on him, and I have the 
opportunity to be guarded by the point guard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Kidd knows not many point guards can stop him one-on-one.  
</P>
<P>
	Ainge said he never thought for a second about any problems he  
might have dealing with Hardaway, despite the perception that he 
was trouble for his coaches in Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Ainge relishes the versatility that Hardaway will give  
the Suns next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm talking about a guy who can dribble,'' Ainge said. ``He  
can play point guard. He can play the two spot. He can play the 
three spot. He can shoot 3's. He can post up. He can pass. He can 
defend. He has the best all-around skills of any player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns were the only team willing to pay Hardaway the maximum  
seven-year, $86 million contract he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Team president and owner Jerry Colangelo has never been shy  
about spending money for big-name players, and the Suns were in 
dire need of an infusion of excitement after a lackluster season 
which ended with the team being eliminated in the first round of 
the playoffs for the fourth year in a row. The team wasn't even 
able to sell out its only home playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo gave his son, Bryan, the general manager, credit for  
mounting the effort that brought Hardaway to Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Colangelo was able to pull off the sign-and-trade  
deal with Orlando without giving up a whole lot -- Danny Manning, 
Pat Garrity and two first-round draft picks. The picks will come 
sometime between 2000 and 2006. 
</P>
<P>
	But, along with Colangelo's checkbook, it was the presence of  
Kidd that did as much as anything to lure Hardaway to the desert. 
</P>
<P>
	``To play with a guy like that is heaven,'' Hardaway said, ``and  
I can't wait until the season starts.''

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybans Up on Forecasts / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean and grain futures prices settled higher  
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade after the release of 
long-range forecasts calling for more dry weather next week in the 
Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in the day, prices fell amid forecasts for weekend rain.  
But forecasters are now calling for a high-pressure ridge to move 
in over much of the grain belt, bringing with it more dry weather. 
</P>
<P>
	That news sent soybean and corn futures prices on an upward  
climb in a day of choppy trading -- with wheat futures following. 
</P>
<P>
	There also were reports that the July soybean crop will be below  
forecasts from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That suggests 
that recent bouts of hot, dry weather may also affect yields later 
in the year, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Friday, wheat for December delivery was up 1 1/4 cents  
to $2.95 3/4 a bushel; December corn rose half a cent to $2.35 1/2 a 
bushel; December oats were up a quarter-cent to $1.17 3/4 a bushel; 
and November soybeans were up 2 3/4 cents to $4.83 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, beef and livestock futures finished the day mostly  
higher on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle rose .25 cent to 64.67 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle were up .15 cent to 76.57 cents a pound; August lean 
hogs rose .30 cent to 50.62 cents a pound; and August pork bellies 
jumped the limit 3 cents to 56.72 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Woodstock Photos Remain on Cop Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Several journalism groups joined The Associated  
Press on Thursday in asking Gov. George Pataki to order police to 
remove copyrighted news photos from a Web site that seeks to 
identify riot suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York State Police posted 14 news photos on its web site  
-- eight by photographers for the AP, four by Syracuse Online and 
two from newspapers -- in an attempt to identify suspects in the 
rioting and looting that marred the end of the concert. 
</P>
<P>
	The pictures were posted July 30 without the permission of the  
news organizations. Both AP and Syracuse Online have demanded the 
pictures be taken down, saying police infringed on their copyrights 
and damaged the traditional separation of news-gathering from 
police activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The pictures remained posted Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	The New York Press Club, The Deadline Club, The New York State  
Associated Press Association and Debby Krenek, editor-in-chief of 
the New York Daily News, each wrote to Pataki to oppose the 
posting. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you allow the State Police's use of the AP's photos to  
persist, the public's confidence in the independence and accuracy 
of the press will be eroded,'' Krenek said. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn Valle, counsel for the state police, said police have no  
plans to remove the photos. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the position of the New York State Police that the  
posting of the previously published newsphotos ... does not 
infringe upon any copyright interests of The Associated Press,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Louis D. Boccardi, president and CEO of the AP, said  
police need to recognize the principal at stake. 
</P>
<P>
	``The role and responsibility of the State Police investigating  
events at Woodstock are both clear and important,'' Boccardi said. 
``So also is the historic and equally important separation of 
police functions and journalistic functions. If our photographers 
are to be seen as proxies for state police investigators, they will 
be placed in danger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon said the governor had ``asked  
his counsel to review'' the letters. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have thus far made 39 arrests on charges ranging from  
disorderly conduct to sodomy. No arrests have been made in the five 
rapes reported at the event, or in any other major 
Woodstock-related crimes. The police have not said that any of the 
arrests were because of the pictures on the Web site.

<HEADLINE> Rider Rides Into Atlanta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Isaiah Rider dropped out of sight for a few days  
after learning of his trade to the Atlanta Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
	The talented guard with the stormy past didn't know what to make  
of another new team, another new start. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, the first day or two was a transition,'' said  
Rider, who made his first appearance with his new team Friday -- 
four days after he was traded by the Portland Trail Blazers. ``Now, 
I'm fine with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rider and Jim Jackson went to Atlanta in a deal that sent Steve  
Smith and Ed Gray to the Blazers. It didn't take long for the 
newest mmber of the Hawks to begin answering questions about his 
checkered career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've learned from my mistakes and I've paid for my mistakes,''  
Rider insisted at a news conference. ``But sometimes people build 
up certain things and make them worse than they really are. They 
make me out to be some kind of animal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rider, 28, has averaged 18 points per game during his six-year  
career, showing the ability to dominate at the offensive end and 
thrive in an up-tempo offense. From that standpoint, he is just the 
kind of player the Hawks were seeking to improve their quickness 
and creativity after ranking as the second-worst offensive team in 
the NBA last season. 
</P>
<P>
	But the rest of Rider's resume provides serious cause for  
concern. He showed up late for his first pro practice with 
Minnesota in 1993 and has run afoul of either the law or the NBA 
every year since then. 
</P>
<P>
	Rider has feuded with coaches, missed flights and practices, has  
been convicted of various offenses, including marijuana possession, 
assault and illegal possession of cellular phones, and even spent 
four days in jail for a probation violation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't dwell on what I did,'' Rider said. ``I can only dwell  
on what I'm doing. I think the positive things outweigh the 
negative. Sure, there are things I did at 22 that I wouldn't do at 
28. The best way to put it is I've learned from my mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe so, but he was suspended three more times by the NBA last  
season -- once for leaving the bench during an altercation, another 
time for a flagrant foul, and finally for leaving the bench to 
intervene in an argument in the stands involving a group of his 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, despite averaging a career-low 13.9 points, Rider was one  
of the top players on a deep Portland team that reached the Western 
Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he goes to the Hawks, where he will try to replace one of  
Atlanta's most popular athletes. In addition to leading the team in 
scoring four years in a row, Smith was active in the community and 
renowned for his charitable contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	Rider, who is entering the final year of his contract, will come  
to Atlanta with a clean record in the eyes of coach Lenny Wilkens. 
</P>
<P>
	``I try not to judge people by what I've been told or things  
that have happened in the past,'' Wilkens said. ``Everything is 
even here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The stoic coach did concede that he ran his own background check  
on Rider, talking with people who knew the 6-foot-5, 220-pound 
guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``It kept coming back that he's good people,'' Wilkens insisted.  
``We all tend to forget what we were like when we were 19, 20 and 
21. We all did crazy things. Even I did some crazy things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rider said he looks forward to injecting new life into the  
Hawks, who have never gotten past the second round of the playoffs 
since moving to Atlanta in 1968. Last season, the team was swept 
out of the postseason in four straight games by the New York 
Knicks, looking old and slow in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta has traded away its starting backcourt, also sending  
point guard Mookie Blaylock to Golden State for a No. 1 pick that 
landed Arizona guard Jason Terry. The Hawks plan to run more as 
they move into a new 20,000-seat arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``The team I saw here was kind of reserved at times,'' said  
Rider, whose nickname is J.R. ``I bring youth. I bring excitement. 
I bring enthusiasm. I think the fans here are going to like J.R. 
Rider.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Wilkens and Rider seem more of an odd couple than Felix  
and Oscar, both coach and player insisted they'll be able to get 
along. For one day at least, that was the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope to get my work ethic and professionalism from Lenny,''  
Rider said. ``I want to be a sponge. I'm definitely going to bounce 
some questions off him and get the most knowledge I can.''

<HEADLINE> Four Small Brokerages Fined for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Four small brokerage firms have been slapped  
with fines of $20,000 or $50,000 for allegedly failing to meet 
deadlines for fully disclosing their computer systems' readiness 
for the Year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the brokerages, however, contend that the fines are  
overly severe because they are completely prepared for the date 
change and, in at least two cases, they eventually submitted the 
required reports. An attorney for two of the firms said Friday they 
planned an appeal to the full Securities and Exchange Commission of 
the ruling Monday by an administrative law judge at the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's outrageous and excessive,'' said Paul Bazil, who  
represents J.W. Barclay &AMP; Co. Inc. of New York City and Stonegate 
Securities Inc. of Dallas. ``There's no substantive violation here 
and nobody is at risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the two firms have completed Year 2000 testing of their  
computer systems, which were found to be ready. In addition, he 
said, ``they have filed all their necessary forms with the SEC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge's action came a week after the SEC said it would go to  
court starting Dec. 1 to shut down brokerage firms that aren't 
ready for the date change. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge, Brenda P. Murray, also censured the four brokerages --  
J.W. Barclay, Stonegate Securities, VBC Securities of Clifton, 
N.J., and William Scott &AMP; Co. of Union, N.J. -- and ordered them to 
refrain from such violations in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	She imposed civil fines of $50,000 each on J.W. Barclay,  
Stonegate Securities and VBC Securities, and a $20,000 fine on 
William Scott, which has fewer assets than the others. 
</P>
<P>
	In her decision, Ms. Murray said the firms failed to submit Year  
2000 readiness reports to the SEC ``for no good reason.'' She said 
they had received ample notice of the filing deadlines late last 
year from the market watchdog agency and the National Association 
of Securities Dealers, a self-policing industry group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Such behavior will destroy effective regulation if left  
unchallenged and untreated,'' Ms. Murray wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The four firms were among 37 relatively small brokerages charged  
by the SEC in October with failing to full report on their Year 
2000 preparedness, in the federal government's first major 
enforcement action related to the millennial date change. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 37 firms, 29 eventually agreed to settlements with the  
SEC and four had their cases dismissed because they went out of 
business, leaving the four brokerage firms fined on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Vincent Comperatore, a managing member of VBC Securities, called  
the $50,000 fine against the six-person brokerage firm 
``crippling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This most certainly is Big Government against small  
businessmen,'' he said, noting that the firm has been Year 2000 
compliant for more than a year. ``My firm takes rules and 
regulations very seriously,'' Comperatore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of William Scott did not immediately return a  
telephone call seeking comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Year 2000 problem -- also called Y2K and the millennium bug --  
occurs because some computer programs, especially older ones, might 
fail when the date changes to 2000. Because the programs were 
written to recognize only the last two digits of a year, such 
programs could read the digits ``00'' as 1900 instead of 2000.

<HEADLINE> United To Create More Legroom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- United Airlines has announced plans to spend more  
than $30 million to create an ``economy plus'' section for its best 
customers who are unable to squeeze into first class. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline will remove one row of seats from the economy  
section in each of its 450 airplanes used for domestic flights. The 
planes will be reconfigured to give passengers in the first six to 
11 rows up to 36 inches of legroom, instead of the standard 31 
inches. 
</P>
<P>
	The 36 inches of legroom is two inches less than what first  
class passengers receive. The new section will not have all the 
other perks of first class. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of loyal business travelers paying good fares  
and who never get an opportunity to upgrade,'' said United 
President Rono Dutta. He noted the airline's first-class seats, 
generally eight to 12 per aircraft, are quickly booked, often by 
members of United's 100,000-mile, frequent-flyer club. 
</P>
<P>
	To reserve an economy plus seat, passengers must either fly at  
least 25,000 miles annually, or pay the full economy fare. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Tony Gwynn Gets 3,000th Hit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Tony Gwynn got his 3,000th career hit Friday  
night, singling in his first at-bat against the Montreal Expos to 
become the 22nd major leaguer to reach that milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn reached down and golfed a soft line drive past second base  
on a 1-2 pitch from Dan Smith, a rookie right-hander making his 
11th career start. His Padres teammates raced from the dugout to 
congratulate him, and first base umpire Kerwin Danley -- Gwynn's 
college teammate at San Diego State -- gave him a hug. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time in 20 years that a NL player reached 3,000  
hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Fireworks, usually reserved for Expos' home runs, were set off  
as soon as the hit dropped in, and Gwynn's mother, Vendella, 
celebrating her 64th birthday, came onto to the field and embraced 
her son. 
</P>
<P>
	The hit came six years to the day since Gwynn got his 2,000th  
career hit against Colorado's Bruce Ruffin. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of less than 10,000 at Olympic Stadium, which was on its  
feet and clapping throughout the at-bat, gave Gwynn a lengthy 
ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	The ball and the first base bag were taken out of play, with one  
or both likely to end up in the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn didn't wait long to get 3,001. In his second at-bat, he  
hit an RBI single up the middle to move past Roberto Clemente into 
21st place on the career list. Al Kaline is next with 3,007. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn's milestone hit came one night after he played in St.  
Louis and witnessed Mark McGwire's 500th career home run. Gwynn 
went 1-for-4 against the Cardinals, leaving him one hit shy of 
3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In a pregame interview, Gwynn said he was not nervous for his  
first at-bat as he was Thursday night against the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to get it done,'' Gwynn said after Thursday  
night's game. ``I just want to get a hit. It's down to one little 
hit. One hit. Chinker, blooper, line drive, just one hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn became the first NL player since the Cardinals' Lou Brock  
in 1979 to reach 3,000 hits. Brock was at Thursday night's game in 
St. Louis, as was Stan Musial, hoping to see Gwynn reach 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Several AL players -- Paul Molitor, Eddie Murray, George Brett,  
Robin Yount, Dave Winfield, Carl Yastrzemski and Rod Carew -- 
reached 3,000 hits in the years since Brock did it. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn got what he wanted quickly against the Expos, becoming the  
first major leaguer to get hit No. 3,000 outside the United States. 
Pete Rose got his 4,000th hit in Montreal as a member of the Expos. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn, 39, has played for the Padres throughout his 18-year  
career, and has hit better than .300 for 16 straight seasons. He is 
tied for Honus Wagner with eight NL batting titles, and hit No. 
3,000 upped this season's average to .319. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn got his first two hits in his major league debut on July  
19, 1982, playing against Rose, and wanted to get No. 3,000 quickly 
so he could beat Wade Boggs to the mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs had 2,997 hits going into Friday night's home game for  
Tampa Bay against Cleveland, and flied out and grounded out in his 
first two at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	This is one of the greatest milestone weeks in baseball history,  
a 500th homer and the possibility of two 3,000th hits. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time those two plateaus were reached so close together  
was in 1970 when Ernie Banks hit his 500th homer and Hank Aaron had 
his 3,000th hit within five days of each other.

<HEADLINE> Retailer Limited Makes a Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's 6 p.m. on a weeknight and the Express store  
on Madison Avenue is crowded with 20-something shoppers fawning 
over the embroidered jeans and ankle-length skirts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was walking by and the stuff in the window caught my eye,''  
said Missy Patel. ``I'm shocked at how cool everything is. I 
haven't shopped here in years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, this is the same Express that only three years ago fashion  
watchers and Wall Street analysts were calling an almost-dead 
retail chain. Sales and profits were slumping and it failed to keep 
up with fashion trends. 
</P>
<P>
	But Express today is making a turnaround, and its success is  
leading the revival of its parent, The Limited Inc., from a 
prolonged slump that was also seen at most of its other divisions: 
the Limited stores, Henry Bendel, Lane Bryant, Structure and Lerner 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Limited is building momentum and seems to be getting its  
act together again,'' said Kurt Barnard, who heads the newsletter 
Barnard's Retail Trend Report. ``Customers who abandon them in the 
last few years see big changes and are willing to shop at their 
stores again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1963 with $5,000 of borrowed money from his aunt, Les  
Wexner built the Columbus, Ohio-based Limited into the nation's 
biggest clothing retailer with more than 5,000 stores. 
</P>
<P>
	For nearly three decades, the Limited was the darling the retail  
industry. Its stores dominated malls nationwide, and it quickly 
became a favorite place for Americans to shop. 
</P>
<P>
	But its business started to crumble in the mid-1990s as other  
retailers wooed shoppers away with better fashions and lower 
prices. Hardest hit were its women's divisions, which failed to 
keep up with competitors like the Gap, Banana Republic and Ann 
Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
	``They forgot that the key to retailing is to give their  
customer what she wanted,'' Barnard said. ``Then their sales and 
profits started to slide, and they realized that they had to make 
some big changes to get their business back on track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the last three years, the Limited has gone through a major  
reorganization. Wexner shuffled top management in many divisions, 
closed nearly 300 underperforming stores and started a massive 
renovation of most of its existing stores. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also created a design team for each of its divisions  
to better keep pace with fashion trends. 
</P>
<P>
	The success of the restructuring is starting to show. On  
Tuesday, the Limited Inc. announced that it expected to beat Wall 
Street analysts' earnings predictions for the quarter -- the second 
time this year that they've topped estimates. The company will 
report earnings on Aug. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also reported that overall same-store sales, which  
track sales at stores open at least a year and are considered a 
gauge of performance, are up a stunning 11 percent this year, well 
above the industry average. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street seems convinced of the turnaround. The company's  
stock is now trading around $45, more than double what it was just 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had some basic steps that they had to take to put their  
business back on track, but they've put all those pieces into place 
and we are starting to see a strong result,'' said John Morris, a 
retail analyst at the investment firm Gerard Klauer Mattison. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the improvements, Morris noted that the women's division  
is better defined. In years' past, merchandise in Express, Lerner 
and the Limited stores looked very similar, but now Express stocks 
hip fashion, the Limited offers classic, casual clothes and Lerner 
New York sells more basic styles. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris also said that the store renovations are also paying off.  
Sales at those stores that have been entirely or partially redone 
are 10 percent to 20 percent higher than those stores still 
operating with the older formats. 
</P>
<P>
	``They definitely are showing significant signs of improvement.  
No one can deny them that,'' Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the company overall is on the mend, Express is clearly the  
standout. That's helped it win back customers like Patel, who had 
abandoned Express a few years ago when she could rarely find 
clothes she liked. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would come in and see nothing that I wanted to buy. After a  
while, I just stopped coming in,'' said Patel, who bought a purple 
blouse and two pairs of black stretch pants on her recent visit to 
the store. 
</P>
<P>
	The new success at Express has even spurred some speculation on  
Wall Street that the Limited may consider a spin off of Express in 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, the Limited has benefitted greatly from its  
public stock offerings of Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, which sells casual 
apparel, and Intimate Brands, which owns Bath &AMP; Body Works and 
Victoria's Secret. The Limited owns an 84 percent stake in Intimate 
Brands. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 24, it will spin off its very popular and profitable  
Limited Too stores, a chain geared for girls ages 7 to 14 that is 
filled with trendy merchandise, such as nail polish in outrageous 
colors, funky accessories and hip clothing styles. 
</P>
<P>
	While most divisions are improving, the Limited still has a way  
to go, especially at its namesake Limited stores and its Structure 
men's chain. The company also must sustain the sales growth at 
those divisions that are already showing signs of improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Limited is one of the oldest and best retailers in the  
business, but they have to make sure that this turnaround lasts,'' 
Barnard said. ``They can't afford to stumble again.''

<HEADLINE> White Offers $25,000 for Man's Bail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Former NFL star Reggie White and his wife are  
offering to pledge $25,000 of the equity in their Green Bay home to 
help post bail for an alleged gang leader facing racketeering and 
narcotics charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorney for Gamaliel Matos, 29, said in federal court this  
week that Reggie and Sara White had made the offer, the Milwaukee 
Journal Sentinel reported in Friday's edition. Reggie White retired 
from the Green Bay Packers earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said the Whites wrote a letter a year ago in  
support of Matos, one of 33 alleged Latin Kings named in 
indictments handed down in June 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Matos, who was working as a youth mentor when indicted, is  
charged with two racketeering counts and conspiring to distribute 
narcotics. The racketeering counts allege he was involved in drug 
trafficking in 1987, an attempted car arson in 1988, an attempted 
murder in 1988 and drug conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Whites said in their letter that they met Matos in 1996 when  
Reggie White, a minister, was preaching at a Milwaukee church. 
</P>
<P>
	``After Gama's dedication to God, he became a new creature,''  
they wrote. ``It was the new Gama that every one of our friends 
knows; you see, the people he impacted after he changed cannot 
imagine the `old' Gama. He has been so instrumental in helping us 
get to the street kids and in helping changing the lives of many 
without hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Whites also wrote a letter supportive of Matos during a 1997  
drug case in Milwaukee County Circuit Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Glenn Reynolds, seeking to have bail set for  
his client, told U.S. Magistrate Judge Aaron E. Goodstein that 
Matos had only one criminal conviction, a misdemeanor for 
possession of the active ingredient of marijuana in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of Matos jammed the courtroom during the hearing.  
</P>
<P>
	``Unlike some others in the case, he's a family man,'' Reynolds  
said of Matos, who is married and has two children. He said Matos 
has been in jail for more than a year without being convicted of a 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``The presumption of innocence ought to be ringing loud and  
clear in these proceedings,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Assistant U.S. Attorney Christian Larsen said Matos was able  
to avoid prosecution after some of his arrests ``through 
intimidation of witnesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seven witnesses ``directly implicated Mr. Matos in drug  
trafficking throughout the length of the conspiracy,'' Larsen said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a leader of the Latin Kings,'' he said. ``He's a person  
who gives orders. He typically doesn't do the acts himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Larsen also said Matos was being investigated by the Internal  
Revenue Service for possible loan fraud regarding four properties 
he owns. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodstein said he wanted more information on the fraud  
investigation before making a decision on bail. The hearing is 
scheduled to continue next month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal Sentinel said it was unable to reach the Whites for  
comment Thursday.

<HEADLINE>  Driver Waltrip To Retire in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- If it wasn't for videotape, Darrell  
Waltrip's two daughters might find it hard to believe he's won a 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	``ESPN has done a real good job giving me some credibility with  
my family,'' said Waltrip, who announced Thursday that he's 
retiring after next season. ``That's about all I've got right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip, always one of racing's great characters, insists he  
still can be a great driver at age 52. Before he walks away from 
the fumes, throaty exhaust and competition for good, he thinks he 
can find his way to victory lane again. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been a long time. Waltrip hasn't won a race since 1992, the  
year his second daughter was born. 
</P>
<P>
	``She'd really like to see her daddy win a race,'' Waltrip said.  
``There are some fun things you get to do when you win a race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Who could forget Waltrip, the good ol' boy from Kentucky, doing  
the ``Icky Shuffle'' in victory lane in 1989 and wailing like a 
child, ``I won the Daytona 500! I won the Daytona 500!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Waltrip hasn't had nearly enough fun.  
</P>
<P>
	He's won three Winston Cup championships and leads active  
drivers with 84 career victories, tied for third with Bobby 
Allison. But Waltrip has been running on fumes of late; he hasn't 
won a race since Darlington in September 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip, who ran out of former champion's provisionals two weeks  
ago at Pocono, unveiled a new car he'll use for the rest of the 
season -- and next year, in what he's calling ``Victory Tour 2000.'' 
He made the bold prediction that he'll qualify consistently in the 
top 25 from now on. 
</P>
<P>
	``There should be no excuse for me and this car to miss races,''  
Waltrip said. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, the Victory Tour got off to an ignominious start Thursday  
when Waltrip stalled just before attempting his qualifying run for 
the Brickyard 400. With less than a minute before time would run 
out on the session, Waltrip fired up the car and was 32nd-fastest 
on the first day of qualifying at 176.478 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	With a sheepish grin, Waltrip explained the mishap.  
</P>
<P>
	``The battery cable was off the battery,'' Waltrip said. ``It's  
a good thing it came off when it did. If it came off during my run, 
I'd be in trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip, who rarely misses a punchline, nailed the one  
pertaining to the name of his victory tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be kind of a fake tour, kind of a farce if we call it  
a victory tour and we don't produce a victory,'' Waltrip said. 
``Winning a race now would be just as special as winning that first 
one in 1975.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Admitting that the end was near left Waltrip momentarily  
speechless -- probably for the first time in his career. He came in 
with a such a bang that it would seem only fitting if he had one 
more trick to pull off. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came into this sport in 1972, and I've been a headliner ever  
since,'' Waltrip said. ``When I'd go to town, people would say, 
`Are you here with the show?' And I'd say, `No, I am the show.''' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a glimpse of the arrogance that earned Waltrip the  
nickname ``Jaws'' in the early days, when he was viewed as stock 
car racing's outlaw. It's been quite a turnabout, because he will 
go out as the beloved ``old DW.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip, a native of Owensboro, Ky., who lives in Franklin,  
Tenn., is finishing a two-year contract with the No. 66 KMart Ford 
Taurus, owned by Travis Carter and Carl Haas. He finished 25th in 
the most recent race at Pocono Raceway and placing 38th in the 
season points. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess in every sport your legs give our, your arm gives out,  
something gives out,'' Waltrip said. ``I think every athlete that's 
been successful like I have, one thing never gives out. Your heart 
never gives out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His younger brother, also a Winston Cup competitor, can attest  
to that. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the book is written about NASCAR racing, he will  
certainly have a chapter in it,'' Michael Waltrip said. ``One of 
the things that I most admire about him is that he's been able to 
do it on his own terms, and that hasn't always made everybody 
happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, every time Waltrip came up with what seemed like  
the one-liner that defined his career, he topped himself. This may 
have said it all. 
</P>
<P>
	``It became painfully obvious to me -- and it hasn't changed all  
that much -- that the squeaky wheel gets the grease,'' Waltrip said. 
``And so I turned up the squealing as hard as I could.''

<HEADLINE>  Driver Waltrip To Retire in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- If it wasn't for videotape, Darrell  
Waltrip's two daughters might find it hard to believe he's won a 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	``ESPN has done a real good job giving me some credibility with  
my family,'' said Waltrip, who announced Thursday that he's 
retiring after next season. ``That's about all I've got right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip, always one of racing's great characters, insists he  
still can be a great driver at age 52. Before he walks away from 
the fumes, throaty exhaust and competition for good, he thinks he 
can find his way to victory lane again. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been a long time. Waltrip hasn't won a race since 1992, the  
year his second daughter was born. 
</P>
<P>
	``She'd really like to see her daddy win a race,'' Waltrip said.  
``There are some fun things you get to do when you win a race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Who could forget Waltrip, the good ol' boy from Kentucky, doing  
the ``Icky Shuffle'' in victory lane in 1989 and wailing like a 
child, ``I won the Daytona 500! I won the Daytona 500!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Waltrip hasn't had nearly enough fun.  
</P>
<P>
	He's won three Winston Cup championships and leads active  
drivers with 84 career victories, tied for third with Bobby 
Allison. But Waltrip has been running on fumes of late; he hasn't 
won a race since Darlington in September 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip, who ran out of former champion's provisionals two weeks  
ago at Pocono, unveiled a new car he'll use for the rest of the 
season -- and next year, in what he's calling ``Victory Tour 2000.'' 
He made the bold prediction that he'll qualify consistently in the 
top 25 from now on. 
</P>
<P>
	``There should be no excuse for me and this car to miss races,''  
Waltrip said. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, the Victory Tour got off to an ignominious start Thursday  
when Waltrip stalled just before attempting his qualifying run for 
the Brickyard 400. With less than a minute before time would run 
out on the session, Waltrip fired up the car and was 32nd-fastest 
on the first day of qualifying at 176.478 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	With a sheepish grin, Waltrip explained the mishap.  
</P>
<P>
	``The battery cable was off the battery,'' Waltrip said. ``It's  
a good thing it came off when it did. If it came off during my run, 
I'd be in trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip, who rarely misses a punchline, nailed the one  
pertaining to the name of his victory tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be kind of a fake tour, kind of a farce if we call it  
a victory tour and we don't produce a victory,'' Waltrip said. 
``Winning a race now would be just as special as winning that first 
one in 1975.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Admitting that the end was near left Waltrip momentarily  
speechless -- probably for the first time in his career. He came in 
with a such a bang that it would seem only fitting if he had one 
more trick to pull off. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came into this sport in 1972, and I've been a headliner ever  
since,'' Waltrip said. ``When I'd go to town, people would say, 
`Are you here with the show?' And I'd say, `No, I am the show.''' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a glimpse of the arrogance that earned Waltrip the  
nickname ``Jaws'' in the early days, when he was viewed as stock 
car racing's outlaw. It's been quite a turnabout, because he will 
go out as the beloved ``old DW.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip, a native of Owensboro, Ky., who lives in Franklin,  
Tenn., is finishing a two-year contract with the No. 66 KMart Ford 
Taurus, owned by Travis Carter and Carl Haas. He finished 25th in 
the most recent race at Pocono Raceway and placing 38th in the 
season points. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess in every sport your legs give our, your arm gives out,  
something gives out,'' Waltrip said. ``I think every athlete that's 
been successful like I have, one thing never gives out. Your heart 
never gives out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His younger brother, also a Winston Cup competitor, can attest  
to that. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the book is written about NASCAR racing, he will  
certainly have a chapter in it,'' Michael Waltrip said. ``One of 
the things that I most admire about him is that he's been able to 
do it on his own terms, and that hasn't always made everybody 
happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, every time Waltrip came up with what seemed like  
the one-liner that defined his career, he topped himself. This may 
have said it all. 
</P>
<P>
	``It became painfully obvious to me -- and it hasn't changed all  
that much -- that the squeaky wheel gets the grease,'' Waltrip said. 
``And so I turned up the squealing as hard as I could.''

<HEADLINE> Innocent Plea in Yosemite Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- A motel handyman pleaded innocent Friday  
to the murder of a Yosemite National Park naturalist who was 
decapitated. 
</P>
<P>
	The plea from Cary Stayner came as the FBI chased leads in the  
February slayings of three park sightseers. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner told investigators he killed all four women but has been  
charged only in the July 21 slaying of Joie Armstrong, who led 
outdoor education programs in the park. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner, who turns 38 next week, could face the death penalty or  
life in prison without parole in Armstrong's death. Another hearing 
before U.S. Magistrate Sandra Snyder was scheduled for Aug. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner lived and worked at the Cedar Lodge where Carole Sund,  
her daughter Juli Sund and family friend Silvina Pelosso were last 
seen alive Feb. 15. He is the only suspect identified by the FBI in 
their slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner's brother, Steven, became national news 19 years ago  
when at 14 he escaped from a child molester who had kidnapped him 
seven years earlier. He brought with him a 5-year-old boy who also 
had been kidnapped. Steven died in a motorcycle accident in 1989.

<HEADLINE> Accident Leaves Jockey Paralyzed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Rudy Baez, the top jockey in New England, probably  
will never walk again, one of his doctors said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Baez was paralyzed from the waist down after severing his spine  
during a spill Wednesday at Rockingham Park in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	He was on a ventilator and in serious condition Friday at  
Massachusetts General Hospital after seven hours of surgery on 
Thursday, but was expected to leave the intensive care unit by 
early next week, hospital spokeswoman Victoria Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although Rudy's odds of regaining some use of his lower  
extremities are not zero, the chances are slight that he will be 
able to walk again,'' said Dr. Brian Labow, the hospital's chief 
resident for trauma surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors said the injuries to the 49-year old jockey did not  
affect his mind and upper extremities. 
</P>
<P>
	Baez was injured Wednesday when his horse, Gaitor Bait, clipped  
the heels of the horse in front of him. The horse fell along the 
rail, sending Baez headlong onto the track. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockingham Park officials reviewed videotapes and decided not to  
disqualify any jockeys. 
</P>
<P>
	Baez, born in the Dominican Republic, lives in Wakefield with  
his wife and three children. He started riding when he was 13 years 
old. He has ridden in 28,000 races, winning more than 4,800 of them 
and nearly $30 million in purses. 
</P>
<P>
	Baez is expected to stay in the hospital for about two weeks,  
and then transfer to a spinal cord rehabilitation facility, 
hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, an official of The Jockeys' Guild said Baez's  
medical expenses will be covered by the thoroughbred industry. The 
guild's Disabled Jockeys' Fund also pays for such expenses as ramps 
and van remodeling.

<HEADLINE> Pan Am Games Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- As the United States piled up more  
medals Friday, including a gold by boxer Gerald Tucker, U.S. team 
officials defended the selection process for the Pan American 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	USOC executive director Richard Schultz said the games have been  
run well, calling it a ``gold medal performance'' by the Winnipeg 
organizers. He also took exception to suggestions the United States 
did not bring its best athletes these games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've accomplished a lot of things here,'' Schultz said.  
``We've seen the media sometimes refer to the U.S. bringing their B 
team. That's not correct. We brought a good combination of athletes 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of them was Tucker, 20, who easily won the bantamweight  
title, outpointing Neouar Cermeno of Venezuela 15-3. He was as 
surprised as anyone the score was so one-sided against his taller 
opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had my hands up, but I was like running into a lot of shots.  
I don't know if it was knocking my head back or not. But I know I 
was feeling punches in there, more than three. So I didn't think it 
was lopsided,'' Tucker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Middleweight Arthur Palac of Hamtramck, Mich., lost to Yohason  
Martinez in the middleweight division as Cuba won the other five 
golds. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. men's basketball team moved into the final against  
Brazil by defeating Argentina 84-76. Brazil took Puerto Rico 95-85. 
</P>
<P>
	Travis Williams scored 19 points to lead the Americans, who will  
try to give the United States it first Pan Ams championship since 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
	American Kaitlin Sandeno, winner of the women's 400-meter  
freestyle, added the 800 in a Pan Ams record 8 minutes, 34.65 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	The victorious women's 400 medley relay team of Denali Knapp,  
100 breaststroke champion Staciana Stitts, 100 butterfly gold 
medalist Karen Campbell and Tammie Spatz set a Pan Ams record of 
4:06.08. 
</P>
<P>
	Joanne Malar of Canada got her second gold. The winner of the  
women's 400 individual medley this time took the 200 IM with a 
second games record, 2:14.18. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernando Scherer, the men's 100 freestyle champion, won the 50  
freestyle and gave the Brazilians a sweep of the four men's 
freestyle races. 
</P>
<P>
	After 26 events, the United States has only seven golds, its  
worst showing in Pan Ams swimming. The men failed to medal in the 
50-meter freestyle for the first time ever. 
</P>
<P>
	A 2-1 victory over Canada gave the U.S. men the soccer bronze  
medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz said the games showcased well-known veteran athletes  
such as softball star Dot Richardson and up-and-comers such as 
19-year-swimmer Ed Moses, who won the gold medal and set a Pan Ams 
record in the 100-meter breaststroke. 
</P>
<P>
	As Friday's competition began, the United States had won 235  
medals, 87 gold. Schultz said that was on par or slightly better 
than the U.S. performance at the 1995 Pan Ams in Mar Del Plata, 
Argentina, where there were 99 more medal events. 
</P>
<P>
	Four Americans have won three medals: Kathy Colin in  
canoe/kayak, Marty Nothstein in cycling, Chad Hedrick in roller 
skating and swimmer Scott Tucker. Nothstein won three golds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're happy with the success of our athletes,'' said Herman  
Frazier, chief of the U.S. delegation. ``There's some things that 
have been said about the athletes we brought here. We brought 
athletes who wanted to compete on the international level and who 
wanted to win on the international level. Our results speak for 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz singled out the performance of the baseball team, a  
collection of minor leaguers who earned a berth for the United 
States in the 2000 Olympics by reaching the gold medal game against 
Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you stop to think that the International Baseball  
Federation only takes two baseball teams from the Americas, that's 
really a challenge,'' Schultz said. ``Because probably three or 
four of the best baseball teams in the world are in the Americas. 
</P>
<P>
	Lea Foreman, of Denmark, Wis., lifted 215 kilograms (474 pounds)  
to take the 69-kilo (152-pound) class. It was the third U.S. gold 
in the games for a woman weightlifter; Robin Byrd Goad earlier won 
the 53-kilo class. Tara Nott won in 48 kilos. 
</P>
<P>
	Denise Parker of Salt Lake City, the leading qualifier, took her  
11th Pan Ams medal with a bronze in archery. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada, the only team to beat the United States in the  
round-robin of men's softball, did it again, 2-1 in the medals 
round. If the Americans can beat Cuba on Saturday, they get another 
shot at Canada for the gold. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's softball powerhouse played Canada in the medals  
round at night.

<HEADLINE> Gingrich Rakes in $1.3M for PAC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even as a private citizen, former House  
Speaker Newt Gingrich can raise more money than most of the 
colleagues he left behind on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the first six months of the year, Gingrich raised $1.3  
million for his new political action committee. Only 40 members of 
the House were able to raise that much for their last campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	And Gingrich still had $283,830 of the money in the bank as of  
June 30, his report to the Federal Election Commission showed. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he was speaker, Newt was the No. 1 draw of the Republican  
Party,'' spokesman Mike Shields said. ``Now he has set up a new 
political action committee to continue to give him an opportunity 
to speak out on what he believes in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others said Gingrich is able to attract the money because he  
still has friends on Capitol Hill that special interests would like 
to reach. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he picks up the phone to call someone, they're going to  
take his call,'' said Bill Hogan, director of investigative 
projects for the Center for Public Integrity, a Washington watchdog 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	The former speaker is setting up his own consulting firm to  
offer advice to clients. By law, he can't lobby Congress until next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich was a prolific fund-raiser as House speaker, sharing  
his largesse with fellow Republicans. But he gave up the post and 
resigned his seat following the GOP's disappointing showing in last 
November's elections. He raised $6.8 million for his re-election 
campaign last year, more than any other House candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	His recent fund-raising efforts have been helped by an all-star  
cast of lobbyists, some of whom served with Gingrich in the House. 
Co-chairs for an April fund-raiser in Washington included former 
Reps. Vin Weber and Robert Walker, former Republican National 
Chairman Haley Barbour, and former White House aides Nicholas Calio 
and Kenneth Duberstein. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Tobacco gave $10,000, as did a company vice president,  
Edward Kratovil. Anheuser-Busch gave $10,000, as did United Parcel 
Service. BellSouth contributed $8,000 and the National Rifle 
Association gave $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The contribution amounts include both money raised under federal  
laws and so-called soft money, which is used to aid state and local 
candidates and does not fall under federal contribution limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich plans to use the money to help Republicans in federal,  
state and local races who agree with the former speaker's desires 
to cap federal, state and local taxes at 25 percent of a person's 
income; use some Social Security funds for private investment 
accounts; and build a national missile defense.

<HEADLINE> New Limit on Trucker Hours To Be Set </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the first time in 60 years, the Federal  
Highway Administration plans to propose new limits on the number of 
hours truckers can drive each day. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency, in a rule this fall, is expected to force drivers to  
be off duty for at least 14 hours in a 24-hour period, according to 
trucking industry sources who spoke Friday on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, truckers are limited to 10 hours behind the wheel in  
one stretch. They then must stop driving for eight hours. After 
that, they can resume driving for up to 10 more hours. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one experienced driver thinks the current system is  
fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too much time away from driving,'' Larry Conrad, who has  
hauled pretzels and potato chips for 39 years for the Bachman Co. 
of Reading, Pa., said of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking from a truck stop along Interstate 68 in Keysers Ridge,  
Md., Conrad said: ``Too many people sit in their ivory towers. They 
should get out on the road and travel a little bit.'' Conrad says 
he averages 100,000 miles a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Highway Administration contends that if truckers are  
ordered off the road for 14 hours in a 24-hour period, it will 
improve the chances they get at least eight hours of sleep during 
their down time, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gail Shibley, spokeswoman for the highway administration,  
refused to discuss the specifics on Friday, pending release of the 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, 5,302 people were killed in truck-related accidents  
on the nation's highways, according to preliminary figures from the 
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	That is a slight drop from 1997 and part of a trend in which the  
truck-related highway fatality rate has been falling, despite 
increased trucking mileage brought on by cheaper gas and an 
increase in next-day business deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, more than 3 percent of the truck-related accidents  
were caused by drowsy truckers, and there has been talk for years 
about ways to improve truck safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The current rules on driving time took effect in 1939.  
</P>
<P>
	The founder of Parents Against Tired Truckers said she was  
unaware of the proposed rule change. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a total surprise,'' said Daphne Izer of Lisbon Falls,  
Maine, whose group had proposed a less restrictive rule limiting 
drivers to 12 hours on and 12 hours off. ``If it's 14 hours (off), 
that would be wonderful,'' she said. ``It will cause an uproar in 
the trucking industry, that's for sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just this week, Congress and the Clinton administration unveiled  
competing truck-safety legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest truckers group, the American Trucking  
Associations, questioned the highway administration's proposal. It 
sent a letter to the agency Thursday asking it to explain the 
science behind its proposal, if any was used. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a proposal that we will be offering, but we are  
putting it to the scientific test now,'' said Mike Russell, the 
group's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the ATA's proposal, which could be announced as early as  
September, will focus less on the number of hours worked and more 
``on the number of hours of rest and the quality of the rest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shibley said that when the highway administration announces its  
final rule, ``it will be science-based'' and grounded ``on the 
reality of circadian rhythms and body science.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Baldwin, safety director at Gulf Coast Transport Inc., a  
150-truck hauling firm in Sunnyvale, Texas, said a fruitful step 
may be getting adequate areas for drivers to rest. In many states, 
rest stops are being closed after hours for safety reasons or 
truckers cannot stop there for more than two hours at a time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where the drivers take their rest is sometimes more important  
than how much rest they get,'' Baldwin said.

<HEADLINE> Cinergy Defaults on Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Cinergy Corp.'s default on contracts for  
delivering wholesale electricity during last week's heat wave is 
raising worries about the stability of the relatively new business 
of marketing power. 
</P>
<P>
	Cinergy, a Cincinnati-based utility company serving 1.4 million  
electric customers in Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana, is discussing 
settlements with a number of trading customers, said Cinergy 
spokeswoman Angeline Protogere. But she said Friday it would be 
premature to release any information on the financial impact. 
</P>
<P>
	``What was important is that we kept the lights on in Ohio,  
Kentucky and Indiana and maintained service to wholesale customers 
outside of our service area, like municipalities,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading customers were cut off on July 30, she said, ``Simply  
because we could not get enough power to meet those obligations for 
a portion of that day due to record heat, record load and 
transmission constraints.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts say Cinergy's troubles reflect some of the  
problems with wholesale trading at a time when the electric 
industry is being deregulated and faces increased competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Some smaller electric suppliers dropped out of the wholesale  
market last year after several defaults and losses for some 
utilities during a sudden surge in prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Raymond Niles, an analyst with Schroder &AMP; Co. of New York, said  
Friday that Cinergy's problems emphasized the vulnerability of 
companies without much experience in deregulated markets. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the recent deregulation has highlighted inefficiencies  
and a lot of bottlenecks in the U.S. electricity grid that have 
been building up over 70 years of regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like someone holding down the dial on a pressure cooker,  
and now the dial is being allowed to move,'' he said. ``It shows 
that there are serious inefficiencies in the infrastructure that 
need to be addressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Niles said that competition over time should help the  
market work better, he believes small electric utilities like 
Cinergy are going to have trouble going from a regional to a 
national presence. 
</P>
<P>
	``The winners will be the national companies with lots of  
experience in deregulated markets,'' he said. ``I think it has 
raised the question of whether some of the smaller regional 
utilities should be in this wholesale marketing business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cinergy's spokeswoman said that there was no disagreement that  
``you need scale and scope'' to be successful in the field. ``And 
that's why I'm sure we will be reviewing the lessons learned from 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Protogere also said a number of customers who were issued  
force majeure letters -- declarations that ``an act of God'' forced 
Cinergy to default on contracts to deliver power on July 30 -- were 
still trading with Cinergy. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston-based Enron Corp., was one of the power companies  
affected. 
</P>

	``I can say that we have no problem with Cinergy, and we feel  
confident that they will fulfill all current and future 
obligations,'' said Enron spokeswoman Traci Warner. 
</P>
<P>
	She wouldn't say whether Enron had suffered any losses because  
of the Cinergy action. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, Aquila Power Corp., based in Kansas City, Mo., said  
Cinergy failed to deliver power on July 23 and July 29. 
</P>
<P>
	``They failed to deliver, and we had to go out and buy it, so we  
have billed them for the difference,'' said Aquila spokesman Al 
Butkus. ``We assume they will pay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the amount billed was a little over $1 million.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, GOP, Set Up Tax Showdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's threat to veto the  
Republican tax plan carried a familiar ring: ``This tax cut will 
not become law,'' he said again Friday. This time the GOP had a 
threat, too: Watch the poll numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said he was ``disappointed though not surprised,''  
that Republicans had pushed their 10-year, $792 billion tax bill 
through Congress on Thursday night. He calls the bill dangerously 
big, sure to create economic havoc if it becomes law. 
</P>
<P>
	All he can do is talk about it for now. Congressional  
Republicans, setting up a September veto showdown, will sit on the 
measure for a while, hoping to build up popular pressure on the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, I think it's in the hands of the American people what  
happens with this bill,'' Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP plans to barnstorm nationwide -- talking up the plan's  
benefits to individual taxpayers and urging Americans to tell 
Washington they want the package. 
</P>
<P>
	``And if they will do that, the president will sign this bill,''  
Lott said. ``I think that if the American people will make 
themselves heard, we'll see once again one of the Clintonian '180s' 
where he said, 'I will veto this bill, I will veto this bill, I 
will veto that bill,' and time after time after time, when the poll 
numbers changed, he signed them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said if he is wrong and Clinton does stick to his guns  
about a veto, ``it will be the strongest indication so far that he 
is entering the phase of being a lame duck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It will say to the Congress and the American people: 'I don't  
care what you say or do, I'm going to veto this.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, with what would be the largest tax cut since President  
Reagan's in 1981, won Senate approval 50-49 after it cleared the 
House 221-206. Both the House and Senate then adjourned until Sept. 
8. 
</P>
<P>
	On the day after, both sides laid claim to the common sense of  
ordinary Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has repeatedly warned that in his view, the tax cut will  
mean enormous cuts in programs Americans hold dear, or more likely 
consign the country to the deficit spending of the Reagan and Bush 
era. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can have a tax cut, but it is wrong to put the cart before  
the horse,'' Clinton said before leaving the White House for a 
weekend trip to Arkansas and Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is wrong to plan the vacation before we pay the home  
mortgage and send the kids to college,'' Clinton said. That's what 
they're proposing to do. It is wrong, it will take us right back to 
the situation that got us in so much trouble in the 1980s, and I 
will not countenance it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton favors a smaller tax cut of about $300 billion using  
whatever budget surplus is left over after accomplishing key goals 
such as shoring up Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American people will be the big losers if President  
Clinton vetoes our commonsense plan to let them keep more of their 
own money,'' retorted Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the 
House Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``With each new day and each new veto threat, it's clear that  
all the president wants is to spend the taxpayers' money on more 
government programs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether or not the bill becomes law, it will serve as a defining  
issue between Republicans and Democrats in the 2000 struggle for 
control of Congress and the race for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would trim the bottom 15 percent income tax rate to 14  
percent in 2003 and reduce other rates by 1 percentage point in 
2005. Relief from the ``marriage penalty'' that affects millions of 
two-income couples would begin in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The estate tax would be repealed gradually starting in 2003, and  
capital gains taxes would be cut from 20 percent to 18 percent for 
most investors retroactive to Jan. 1, 1999. There are breaks for 
education and health care, expanded IRAs and pensions and other 
help for businesses large and small.

<HEADLINE> Museum Store Pulls A-Bomb Earrings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIRTLAND AIR FORCE BASE, N.M. (AP) -- Souvenir earrings with tiny  
silver replicas of the atomic bombs dropped on Japan will no longer 
be sold at the National Atomic Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's decision to pull the earrings comes on the 54th  
anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima. 
</P>
<P>
	The earrings -- shaped like ``Little Boy,'' which was dropped on  
Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945, and ``Fat Man,'' which was dropped on 
Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1945 -- had drawn protests from Gensuikyo, an 
anti-nuclear group in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The foundation (that operates the museum) just decided since  
it's a sensitive day and there's so much concern, it just wasn't 
worth the bad feelings,'' museum director Jim Walther said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Museum store manager Tony Sparks said the earrings were the most  
popular jewelry item sold in the store. He said the earrings were 
sold out Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Walther said there are no plans to restock the earrings,  
although customer orders received before Friday's decision will 
still be filled. 
</P>
<P>
	Gensuikyo spokeswoman Naomi Kishimoto said Thursday: ``It's not  
the sort of thing you should be hanging from your ears or using to 
decorate your desk.'' She called the museum's earring sales 
``unforgivable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese group had learned of the earrings on the museum's  
Web site, which also was revised to remove mention of the earrings. 
</P>
<P>
	Other items in the museum store include desk ornaments  
commemorating the bombing runs and diagrams of the bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	Walther said the museum doesn't advocate war or the use of  
nuclear weapons and that the items are simply souvenirs of museum 
displays.

<HEADLINE> Activists' Memorial Stone Impounded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A memorial to civilian war victims stopped  
short of its intended resting place Friday after police impounded 
the 2,000-pound tombstone during a rally just outside Arlington 
National Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	Volunteers tugging the granite slab, which measures 6 feet by 4  
feet and is engraved with the words ``Unknown Civilians Killed in 
Wars,'' finished their six-state odyssey in the middle of Memorial 
Bridge, which crosses the Potomac River from the Lincoln Memorial 
to the cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	``Were we to complete the journey today and bring it to  
Arlington, the stone would be discarded, rejected like the very 
message it embodies,'' said Lewis Randa, the ``Stonewalk'' 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	Randa arranged for a U.S. Park Police escort, then impoundment  
of the memorial, because ``this stone has no home.'' He promised 
his group will return for it once Congress passes a law allowing 
its erection at Arlington. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, no sponsor has come forward.  
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., was asked to introduce the  
necessary legislation, but he didn't feel the group's request was 
feasible. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd be glad to work with them to make sure it gets placed in  
another position of prominence in Washington, but it's just not 
going to happen (in Arlington),'' said Kennedy spokesman Larry 
Berman. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for the U.S. Park Police said the stone would  
remain in a secured lot for a certain period but would be destroyed 
if it went unclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
	Randa has led about a half-dozen ``stonewalkers'' on a 450-plus  
mile trek since leaving July 4 from the Boston suburb of Sherborn, 
Mass. The procession traveled on secondary roads and highways, 
beside motorcycles, cars and 18-wheelers. It picked up, and 
dropped, additional volunteers from each community along the way. 
Leading the walk in Washington were Hugh Thompson and Larry 
Colburn, two of three Army soldiers credited with stopping the My 
Lai massacre during the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to be vulnerable,'' Randa said. ``We wanted to not  
have enough people so people would help us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turnout was overwhelming in some regions, spotty in others. The  
stone rests on a 1,500-pound cart, and at moments when the caravan 
lacked enough people to drive it up hills, Randa said, enough 
motorists always pulled over, jumped out and helped push to clear 
the obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
	The group arrived Thursday in Washington and rested all  
afternoon on the Capitol's west lawn. At night, the 
``Stonewalkers'' pulled the monument to the Lincoln Memorial for a 
foot-washing ceremony and an anniversary memorial service for those 
who died when the United States dropped the atomic bomb on 
Hiroshima, Japan, during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Randa wants the stone to ultimately rest near the Tomb of the  
Unknowns but officials say that's unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	Arlington National Cemetery was established as a shrine to those  
who served in the armed forces, said Dov Schwartz, a spokesman for 
the Military District of Washington, which runs the cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	``The law says that monuments will be accepted only if they  
honor those dying in the military service of the United States,'' 
Schwartz said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Volunteers lugging a 2,000-pound memorial to  
civilian war victims have reached their destination -- the nation's 
capital -- after a six-state odyssey. But they have yet to reach 
their target -- Arlington National Cemetery -- and may never do so 
without the help of Congress. That, some lawmakers say, is 
unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	The group behind the ``Stonewalk'' left more than a month ago  
from the Boston suburb of Sherborn with a 6-foot-by-4-foot granite 
tombstone engraved with the words, ``Unknown Civilians Killed in 
Wars.'' About a half-dozen people have trekked the entire 450-plus 
miles, traveling on secondary roads and highways beside 
motorcycles, cars and 18-wheelers. The group picked up, and 
dropped, additional volunteers from each community along the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to be vulnerable,'' said Lewis Randa, the project's  
director. ``We wanted to not have enough people so people would 
help us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turnout was overwhelming in some regions, spotty in others. But  
during moments when the group lacked enough people to drive the 
stone -- which rests on a 1,500-pound cart -- up hills, Randa said 
enough motorists have always pulled over, jumped out and helped 
push. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most impressive thing on the journey has been the  
spontaneous acts of generosity by people who were driving by and 
realizing these people are struggling to get this up the hill,'' 
Randa said. ``And many of them didn't know what we were doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``stonewalkers'' arrived Thursday in Washington, resting all  
afternoon on the west lawn of the Capitol. At night, the group 
pulled the stone to the Lincoln Memorial for a footwashing ceremony 
and an anniversary memorial service for those who died when the 
atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the group was to cross the Memorial Bridge toward  
Arlington National Cemetery. Ultimately, that's where the stone 
should rest, preferably near the Tomb of the Unknowns, Randa said, 
while acknowledging he has no permission to leave it there. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were told if we left it there it would be discarded and  
removed from the property and treated like protest material,'' he 
said. ``The people of Arlington have been clear in explaining the 
requirements for a stone to go into Arlington and we've been clear 
that we are coming with the stone to formally present it to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arlington National Cemetery was established as a shrine to those  
who served in the armed forces, said Dov Schwartz, a spokesman for 
the Military District of Washington, which runs the cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	``The law says that monuments will be accepted only if they  
honor those dying in the military service of the United States,'' 
Schwartz said. ``The only way a monument or memorial can be put in 
Arlington National Cemetery is if Congress passes a current or 
joint resolution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, no one has come forward to sponsor such a proposal.  
</P>
<P>
	Rep. James McGovern, D-Mass., has encouraged the group to get  
support from veterans organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll try to help them in any way we can but in terms of  
actually getting into Arlington, there's a process you have to go 
through,'' said McGovern spokesman Michael Mershon. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., was asked to introduce  
legislation, but he didn't feel the group's request was feasible.

<HEADLINE> Japan Bank Seeks Insolvency Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's troubled Namihaya Bank said today has asked  
financial authorities to declare it insolvent. 
</P>
<P>
	The regional bank said it made the request to the Financial  
Reconstruction Committee after facing difficulties attracting new 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision follows a recent inspection of accounts at the  
Osaka-based bank's books, which found Namihaya's liabilities 
exceeded assets by 100 billion yen ($875 million) as of March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	If the committee acts, Namihaya will be the fourth regional bank  
to fail this year in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the country's financial reconstruction laws, the  
government will appoint an administrator to transfer assets and 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's banks have been struggling to deal with loans which have  
soured amid the nation's economic slowdown.

<HEADLINE> Northwest, Japan Air To Share Codes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAGAN, Minn. (AP) -- Northwest Airlines and Japan Air System will  
inaugurate code-share service Saturday between Osaka and Okinawa 
and Fukuoka, Japan, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a code-sharing arrangement, airlines share flight numbers,  
meaning passengers who book flights with one airline may actually 
fly on a partner airline's jet. 
</P>
<P>
	The code-share service marks the beginning of a larger alliance  
between the two carriers which began in November, 1997, when they 
introduced reciprocal frequent flyer programs. JAS is one of the 
largest domestic carriers in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest operates nonstop service between Osaka's Kansai  
International Airport and Detroit, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Seattle, 
Los Angeles and Honolulu. Effective Saturday, a Northwest flight 
code will appear on JAS connecting service between Kansai and 
Okinawa and Fukuoka. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest and JAS plan to expand code-share service to other JAS  
domestic routes and to Northwest's extensive U.S.-Japan routes as 
well as routes between Japan and other points in Asia.

<HEADLINE> Equal Immigration Rights Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has sent Congress a bill  
that would equalize immigration rights for people from Central 
America and Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
	Traveling to the hurricane ravaged region earlier this year,  
Clinton said he would seek to correct an imbalance in immigration 
laws that gave advantage to people who had fled communist regimes 
in Cuba and Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like Nicaraguans and Cubans, many Salvadorans, Guatemalans,  
Hondurans and Haitians fled human rights abuses or unstable 
political economic conditions in the 1980s and 1990s,'' Clinton 
said in a letter to Congress. ``Yet these latter groups received 
lesser treatment than that granted to Nicaraguans and Cubans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Central American and Haitian Parity Act,'' introduced  
Thursday night by Reps. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., and Christopher 
Smith, R-N.J., would offer the same protection to fled violence, 
human rights abuses and unrest in other nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the legislation, migrants from Haiti, El Salvador,  
Guatemala and Honduras who have resided continuously in the United 
States since Dec. 1, 1995, and haven't been convicted of a crime, 
would be eligible to become permanent U.S. residents. 
</P>
<P>
	It would provide similar treatment to Haitians who sought  
protection in the United States in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Immigration and Naturalization Service said it  
will create more consistent procedures for officials to follow when 
dealing with illegal aliens facing deportation. The guidelines will 
end a system that varied from region to region, INS officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The agency is committed to fairness, consistency and  
timeliness,'' said INS Commissioner Doris Meissner. ``The 
procedures announced today will meet these commitments while 
keeping community safety a top priority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The guidelines, which take effect immediately, are interim until  
permanent rules are written and published. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rules deal with individuals who have been ordered  
removed from the country but face delays for various reasons. In 
some cases, for instance, U.S. relations with an alien's country 
can slow the exchange of needed information and delay the process, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's in those situations, officials must decide whether to  
continue to detain the individual or release them if they are not a 
threat to public safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the changes are reviews at various levels of the agency to  
ensure fair treatment. It also provides a timeline where the agency 
must continually review a case to determine if an alien should 
continue to be detained or be released. 
</P>
<P>
	Release ``was not always uniformly applied by different  
districts,'' said John O'Malley, an INS spokesman. ``This makes 
sure when it's appropriate they do.''

<HEADLINE>  Does McGwire Have Shot at Aaron? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Suddenly, 755 homers doesn't seem like such a  
formidable milestone for Mark McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	Having hit his 500th and 501st homers Thursday night, the  
natural question for McGwire is whether he can reach Hank Aaron's 
career mark. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too far away,'' McGwire said. ``The logical answer if  
anybody wants to talk about somebody who's going to break the 
record would be Ken Griffey Jr.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron, though, thinks McGwire can do it.  
</P>
<P>
	``The way he's hitting home runs, he could break the record next  
year,'' Aaron said from Three Rivers Stadium, where he watched 
McGwire's two homers Thursday night on the scoreboard video screen. 
``He's hitting them in bunches. Seventy home runs? He might hit 80 
some year. Whew! That's a lot of home runs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Time is against McGwire. Though he's the fastest man to 500 in  
history by 314 at-bats -- more than half a season's worth -- he'll be 
36 on Oct. 1. Heel injuries robbed him of two prime years, when he 
totaled 18 homers in 1993 and '94. 
</P>
<P>
	The key now is his back, which occasionally flares up.  
</P>
<P>
	``It all comes down to health,'' McGwire said. ``I think the  
biggest concern for me as far as longevity is my back. If my back 
holds up, I can play for a few more years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the back hasn't bothered him too much, considering he has  
hit 224 homers the last 3 1/2 seasons, and could get another 20 or so 
this year. If he hits close to 50 a season after that, which right 
now is a modest total for McGwire, Aaron's mark might well be in 
range. 
</P>
<P>
	As McGwire gets older, of course, his production will almost  
certainly slow down. At 36, Aaron had 554 home runs heading into 
the 1970 season and hit 159 in his next four years. In his final 
three years, however, he hit just 52. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey is most often mentioned as the player likely to surpass  
Aaron, having started earlier. He has 385 home runs, and will turn 
30 on Nov. 21. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also has been coy about a desire to break Aaron's record,  
causing many to question whether he has the passion to do it. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire has been tenacious whenever he nears a milestone or gets  
into a duel as he did last year with Sammy Sosa, with each player 
bringing out the best in the other. McGwire homered five times in 
the last three games to bury Sosa and finish with a record 70. 
</P>
<P>
	``He maintained intense concentration for six months, which is  
almost impossible to do, unless you're Superman,'' manager Tony La 
Russa said. ``I think sometimes he's Superman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire wanted to hit No. 500 in St. Louis, where he also hit  
Nos. 61, 62 and 70 last year, so he hit seven in the just-completed 
seven-game homestand. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mind is very, very strong,'' McGwire said. ``When I get in  
that box, I'm totally focused. I know what I need to do to get 
ready each game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres were in awe.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's like he's allergic to a base-hit, too,'' manager Bruce  
Bochy said. ``I mean, the ball's leaving the park every time he 
hits it. I don't know where he's going to finish, but I mean, pure 
power, he's got to be the greatest power hitter of all time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now McGwire belongs to a very exclusive club. Every eligible  
500-homer man is in the Hall, and Eddie Murray, the last man to 
reach the milestone in 1996, will be there soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray, at 504, is the next target. Others are Mel Ott (511),  
Ernie Banks and Eddie Matthews (512), Ted Williams and Willie 
McCovey (521). 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm well aware of the names,'' McGwire said. ``It's rather odd  
to have your name with that group because I feel I have a few more 
years to play. I'm not done playing.''

</P>
<P>
	``It's too far away,'' McGwire said. ``The logical answer if  
anybody wants to talk about somebody who's going to break the 
record would be Ken Griffey Jr.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron, though, thinks McGwire can do it.  
</P>
<P>
	``The way he's hitting home runs, he could break the record next  
year,'' Aaron said from Three Rivers Stadium, where he watched 
McGwire's two homers Thursday night on the scoreboard video screen. 
``He's hitting them in bunches. Seventy home runs? He might hit 80 
some year. Whew! That's a lot of home runs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Time is against McGwire. Though he's the fastest man to 500 in  
history by 314 at-bats -- more than half a season's worth -- he'll be 
36 on Oct. 1. Heel injuries robbed him of two prime years, when he 
totaled 18 homers in 1993 and '94. 
</P>
<P>
	The key now is his back, which occasionally flares up.  
</P>
<P>
	``It all comes down to health,'' McGwire said. ``I think the  
biggest concern for me as far as longevity is my back. If my back 
holds up, I can play for a few more years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the back hasn't bothered him too much, considering he has  
hit 224 homers the last 3 1/2 seasons, and could get another 20 or so 
this year. If he hits close to 50 a season after that, which right 
now is a modest total for McGwire, Aaron's mark might well be in 
range. 
</P>
<P>
	As McGwire gets older, of course, his production will almost  
certainly slow down. At 36, Aaron had 554 home runs heading into 
the 1970 season and hit 159 in his next four years. In his final 
three years, however, he hit just 52. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey is most often mentioned as the player likely to surpass  
Aaron, having started earlier. He has 385 home runs, and will turn 
30 on Nov. 21. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also has been coy about a desire to break Aaron's record,  
causing many to question whether he has the passion to do it. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire has been tenacious whenever he nears a milestone or gets  
into a duel as he did last year with Sammy Sosa, with each player 
bringing out the best in the other. McGwire homered five times in 
the last three games to bury Sosa and finish with a record 70. 
</P>
<P>
	``He maintained intense concentration for six months, which is  
almost impossible to do, unless you're Superman,'' manager Tony La 
Russa said. ``I think sometimes he's Superman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire wanted to hit No. 500 in St. Louis, where he also hit  
Nos. 61, 62 and 70 last year, so he hit seven in the just-completed 
seven-game homestand. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mind is very, very strong,'' McGwire said. ``When I get in  
that box, I'm totally focused. I know what I need to do to get 
ready each game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres were in awe.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's like he's allergic to a base-hit, too,'' manager Bruce  
Bochy said. ``I mean, the ball's leaving the park every time he 
hits it. I don't know where he's going to finish, but I mean, pure 
power, he's got to be the greatest power hitter of all time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now McGwire belongs to a very exclusive club. Every eligible  
500-homer man is in the Hall, and Eddie Murray, the last man to 
reach the milestone in 1996, will be there soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray, at 504, is the next target. Others are Mel Ott (511),  
Ernie Banks and Eddie Matthews (512), Ted Williams and Willie 
McCovey (521). 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm well aware of the names,'' McGwire said. ``It's rather odd  
to have your name with that group because I feel I have a few more 
years to play. I'm not done playing.''

<HEADLINE> Dissidents: 30 Killed in Iraq Clash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Protests over food and medicine shortages in  
two southern cities triggered three days of clashes that left 16 
Iraqi soldiers and 14 civilians dead, a dissident Iraqi group said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The London-based Iraqi National Congress said the clashes began  
July 25 when residents of Rumaitha, 150 miles southwest of the 
capital, Baghdad, and nearby Khudur took to the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement said President Saddam Hussein ordered a tank unit  
from the elite Republican Guard to quell the riots after 16 
soldiers were killed. Fourteen people died in subsequent clashes 
and 112 others were arrested, the group's statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The incidents could not be independently confirmed.  
</P>
<P>
	Tank crews also shelled 40 houses and threatened to severely  
punish those who resisted their orders, said the statement, which 
was faxed to The Associated Press in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said the Republican Guard kidnapped Kadhem  
Abdul-Sayeed, a leader of one of the tribes involved in the 
clashes. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumaitha is in the heart of Iraq's mainly Muslim Shiite south,  
where government opposition is strong.

<HEADLINE> Gun Control Compromise Talks Opened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House and Senate lawmakers are re-opening gun  
control talks months after the chambers took starkly different 
approaches to juvenile violence in response to a spate of school 
shootings this year. 
</P>
<P>
	A committee of 34 House members and senators took two hours to  
give opening statements on the disagreement -- then adjourned, 
assigning aides to hammer out the differences while Congress goes 
on summer vacation this month. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton challenged the panel to stay in session  
through the month-long recess that begins next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's show our children that when it comes to their safety,  
Washington will not take a break,'' Clinton said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans on the conference committee quashed several  
Democratic efforts to keep the panel in session, and said that 
passions are running so high in the wake of school and other 
shootings this year that the talks will take more time. 
</P>
<P>
	``The substantive and political differences are very great  
here,'' conference chairman Orrin Hatch, a Republican senator from 
Utah, told the 34-member panel. ``This is not some itty bitty 
thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather do it right than do it in a hurry,'' House  
Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde of Illinois concurred. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats said doing the right thing means passing new gun  
restrictions before the new school year starts in a few weeks, a 
policy that many Republicans believe is unnecessary. Democrats said 
Congress could have new blood on its hands by waiting until the end 
of August recess to pass legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will have copycat shootings,'' said Rep. Carolyn McCarthy,  
D-N.Y., whose husband was shot to death during a rampage in Long 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
	They again accused Republicans of fighting new gun control on  
behalf of the gun lobby. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are those in both bodies who prefer no conference and no  
action,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, ranking Democrat on 
Hatch's Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-hour meeting was the first congressional action on gun  
control since the Senate passed new restrictions May 20 by one 
vote, and the House stripped that language from a companion bill on 
June 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the House voted to ask negotiators to write a  
compromise juvenile justice bill that would require background 
checks for all firearms sales at gun shows. Under current law, 
background checks are required only on sales by licensed dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution also called for including measures to prevent  
violence in schools and ensuring that the legislation does not 
weaken existing gun regulations.

<HEADLINE> Barton Victims Had Loaned Him Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Colleagues who had lent Mark Barton money were  
among those killed in his shooting spree last week at two day 
trading offices, the lead investigator in the case said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no way of knowing if he had paid them back or whether  
he was going to pay them,'' Detective Mark Walden said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Walden said it was not known if Barton picked his victims before  
opening fire in the two offices on July 29, killing nine and 
injuring 13 before killing himself five hours later. In the days 
leading up to the gunfire, he killed his wife and his two children 
in Stockbridge. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, one week after Barton's rampage, there was more  
workplace violence. In Pelham, Ala., a man shot two people to death 
at his company's office and then killed a third at a business where 
he used to work. Police charged 34-year-old Alan Eugene Miller of 
Billingsley with three counts of capital murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``To a degree it's really frightening that all of a sudden ...  
someone is copying this,'' said Fred Herder, a day trader who was 
released from the hospital Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Walden said that Barton's attack did not consist of random  
shooting, but at times he pulled the trigger at point-blank range 
at people cowering under desks and chairs. 
</P>
<P>
	In a note left in the Stockbridge apartment where he killed his  
family, Barton wrote that he planned to live ``just long enough to 
kill ... the people that greedily sought my destruction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with the two day trading companies, Montvale,  
N.J.-based All-Tech Investment Group and Houston-based Momentum 
Securities, said loans made to cover margins, or money borrowed to 
buy stock, are common and are usually repaid the next day, with 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution  
reported this week that Barton lost $400,000 to $450,000 trading at 
All-Tech and Momentum in the past year. Momentum officials 
previously disclosed that Barton had lost $105,000 since June, 
including $20,000 just days before the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Herder, who sat next to Barton for the nine months Barton was at  
All-Tech, recalled loaning Barton money once but could not recall 
the amount. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that he lost a considerable amount of money and that  
money may have been one of the issues that possibly caused this to 
happen,'' Walden said. ``But there are a lot of questions that will 
never be answered.''

<HEADLINE> Miller Cautions Murray on Managing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Eddie Murray will get his first taste of  
managing this autumn with the Scottsdale Scorpions in the Arizona 
Fall League. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray, who serves as bench coach for Orioles manager Ray  
Miller, will report to Arizona after Baltimore's season ends Oct. 
3. According to Miller, the future Hall of Famer might find 
managing to be a difficult proposition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eddie's two biggest problems would be No. 1, umpiring. Talking  
to them,'' Miller said Friday. ``And having to deal somewhat with 
the press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murray rarely grants interviews, and a big league manager must  
speak to the press at least twice daily. But that's only a small 
part of the job description. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you manage, especially at the major league level, you're  
selling tickets,'' Miller said. ``There are budgets you have to be 
aware of, and nobody wants to hire somebody who sits here and is 
too critical of his players and runs people away. You're always 
getting pushed to be positive but be aggressive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murray will get a taste of all this in the months ahead, but  
working with players in the Fall League is a whole lot different 
from the majors, or even the Winter League. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eddie doesn't know this, but each guy comes along with a  
do-it-yourself kit,'' Miller said. ``They want this guy to pitch 
every fourth day, they want this guy to catch every other day and 
work on this and work on that. You're answering to five different 
clubs. But it's a good experience for you.''

<HEADLINE>  Clinton: States Seeing Worst Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The current drought is the worst ever recorded  
for agriculture in four Northeastern states, and it threatens to 
cripple businesses and communities that depend on devastated farm 
economies, President Clinton said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Throughout much of this country, we have seen the worst  
drought since the Dust Bowl days,'' Clinton said today before 
leaving the White House for a weekend trip to Arkansas and 
Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	The drought is the worst ever for farmers in Maryland, Delaware,  
New Jersey and Rhode Island, the president said. Maryland and New 
Jersey have imposed state water restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Such a natural calamity can have devastating consequences, not  
only for farmers, but for small businesses and communities that 
depend upon a thriving agricultural sector; and for the electric 
power system so vital to our nation,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the government has worked hard to help  
drought-stricken farmers, but ``we must do more. It is our duty as 
a national community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Some parts of the country are in the grips of a drought of  
historic proportions,'' Deputy Commerce Secretary Robert L. Mallett 
said at a news briefing. 
</P>
<P>
	And there was little promise for relief.  
</P>
<P>
	Many parts of the East are eight to 18 inches below the normal  
rainfall over the last year and while the outlook is for a return 
to normal rainfall, that will not make up the deficit, said James 
Baker, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``This drought did not happen overnight ... and it will take a  
long time to be alleviated,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At another briefing today, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman  
said the drought has not affected commodity and consumer prices 
because it is not impacting the large growing regions of the 
Midwest and California. 
</P>
<P>
	But by being concentrated in the East, the dry period has been  
particularly hard on smaller farmers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House will convene a task force of affected federal  
agencies ``to coordinate our efforts and focus our attack on this 
problem,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also said he thinks Congress will come through with  
emergency farm money soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``There needs to be a special provision to deal with the drought  
crisis, and I hope ... and believe that there will be,'' Clinton 
said in response to a reporter's question about criticism of the 
administration's efforts so far. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish we could have done it before the August recess,''  
Clinton said, referring to a vacation break in Congress, ``But I 
think it will be there in time to aid the farmers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate approved $7.4 billion in emergency farm aid on  
Wednesday. The House will consider an emergency aid package after 
the recess.

<HEADLINE> BP Amoco Acknowledges Cancer Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAPERVILLE, Ill. (AP) -- BP Amoco health officials have  
acknowledged that six employees probably got deadly brain cancer 
from their work in one wing of the company's sprawling research 
center in suburban Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers representing a number of former Amoco employees or their  
survivors offered a mixture of frustration and hope -- but no 
surprise -- after Thursday's acknowledgement. 
</P>
<P>
	But the three-year study by investigators from the University of  
Alabama at Birmingham and Johns Hopkins University that points to a 
job-related pattern for those men also dismisses any work 
connection for more than a dozen other employees stricken with 
different tumors, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is part of their legal strategy to excise the cases  
they think are the strongest and to divide and conquer,'' attorney 
Grant Thornton said Friday. He represents six former Amoco 
employees, but not any who are the focus of the company's 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Other attorneys also suggested the company was dragging its feet  
because it is reluctant to admit responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they're concluding about the (brain cancer) cases is  
probably less strong than what my experts concluded a year ago,'' 
said attorney Marios Karayannis, whose father Nick was among the 
Amoco researchers killed by a malignant head tumor. 
</P>
<P>
	Karayannis and another attorney said the company may be moving  
toward settling the cases involving the six men. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to go talk to those families and find out what  
they need,'' Amoco spokeswoman Vicki J. Kastory said Thursday. ``We 
are going to share their financial burden. What I don't know is 
what that means in terms of dollars and cents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kastory said the company would not comment further on the  
lawsuits, and another spokeswoman did not return a telephone call 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten lawsuits have been filed against the company on behalf of 21  
people, some with malignant brain tumors, others with non-cancerous 
tumors in their heads and still others with different types of 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuits allege workers were exposed to numerous neurotoxins  
-- elements that poison the central nervous system -- because of 
inadequate ventilation and lax safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1989, 20 center workers have been diagnosed with benign  
and malignant brain tumors; 14 worked in the chemical research 
complex on the center's sprawling campus. The six with glioma all 
worked within that complex, and most worked on the same floor in 
building 503. Five of the men have died. 
</P>
<P>
	The glioma rate in building 503 is eight times the national  
average. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco has spent millions investigating and hiring experts to  
determine what, if anything, in the workplace caused these tumors.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Contesting Sotomayor Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba on Friday pledged to defend high jump  
champion Javier Sotomayor, charging his positive test for cocaine 
was part of a larger campaign to discredit the communist government 
-- possibly by the CIA or Miami exiles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mud of Winnipeg will never make us dirty,'' the Communist  
Party daily Granma said in an extensive front page story. ``Cuban 
sports and the revolution will be strengthened by this shadowy 
episode of Winnipeg.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban government ``will defend to the end the integrity and  
honor of Sotomayor and any other honest athlete like him,'' the 
article said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We absolutely trust the word of Javier Sotomayor because he  
has won the right to be believed,'' it said. ``Much moreso than of 
that which can be created in laboratories with supposedly efficient 
procedures ... than in food and other services in which the hands 
of the CIA or the anti-Cuban mafia could introduce a dose of a 
prohibited substance in any food or liquid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor denies knowingly ingesting the cocaine that showed  
during drug tests at the Pan American Games. Both he and Cuban 
authorities have suggested his food or drink may have been laced 
with the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Pan Am medical officials, though, have said all that matters is  
that the drug was in Sotomayor's urine. They said they don't 
question how it got there. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sotomayor case is the biggest drug scandal in track and  
field since Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson was suspended and 
stripped of his gold medal after testing positive for an anabolic 
steroid at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor declared his innocence in interviews published and  
broadcast Thursday by Cuba's government-controlled media. He said 
he had never seen cocaine in his life and he didn't even take 
vitamins. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor, the world indoor and outdoor record-holder and the  
only high jumper to clear 8 feet, won his fourth Pan Ams gold in 
the high jump Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the drug test results, he was stripped of the medal  
and will be suspended for two years by the IAAF, the world 
governing body for track and field. That makes him ineligible for 
this month's world championships in Seville, Spain, and next year's 
Sydney Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubans are expected to appeal the ban.  
</P>
<P>
	``The aggression against Sotomayor,'' Granma said Friday, ``is  
an important link in the chain against Cuba and its sports that 
began with the start of the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``This could come, surely it comes, from farther away, as part  
of the strategy that has been going on for decades to harm and 
discredit the Cuban Revolution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor was the third athlete -- all gold medalists -- to test  
positive at the games. Canada's in-line roller hockey team lost its 
gold medal after goalie Steve Vezina's positive test for steroids 
and stimulants. The Dominican Republic's Juana Rosario Arrendel, 
the women's high jump winner, lost her prize as well for testing 
positive for steroids. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor's urine sample showed a reading consistent with a  
person who uses cocaine, Pan Ams medical chief Eduardo de Rose 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Recreational drug use remains rare in Cuba and is frowned upon  
by Fidel Castro's government, which considers it a negative 
byproduct of capitalism. But drug use has grown in recent years 
with an increase of tourism to the island nation.

<HEADLINE> Players Prepare for Hall Induction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANTON, Ohio (AP) -- Ozzie Newsome and Tom Mack are coming home.  
</P>
<P>
	Newsome, who spent his entire career with the Cleveland Browns,  
and Mack, a native of Cleveland, are returning to their old 
neighborhood to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on 
Saturday. They'll be joined by New York Giants linebacker Lawrence 
Taylor, No. 3 career rusher Eric Dickerson and veterans committee 
nominee Billy Shaw in the 1999 class. 
</P>
<P>
	Rounding out the Cleveland-themed weekend, the new Browns  
expansion franchise takes the field for the first time when it 
takes on Dallas in Monday night's Hall of Fame exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsome waited four years before gaining admission, but the  
timing couldn't have been better. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was worth the wait,'' said Newsome, who will be presented  
by former Browns teammate Calvin Hill. ``There was disappointment 
the first year, the second year and the third year when I got into 
the final six, but didn't make it. 
</P>
<P>
	To be going in at the same time those guys are going back on the  
field -- those orange helmets show up and football returns to the 
lakefront -- that makes it worth the wait.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newsome became one of the game's pre-eminent tight ends in his  
13 seasons with the Browns, catching 662 passes for 7,980 yards and 
47 touchdowns. Born in Muscle Shoals, Ala., and a former player for 
the Crimson Tide, Newsome rarely dropped a pass, missed a block or 
ran a ragged route. 
</P>
<P>
	He became the Browns' director of pro personnel in 1994 and then  
moved to Baltimore when owner Art Modell broke the hearts of 
Clevelanders by taking away the franchise that became the Baltimore 
Ravens. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsome's heart still belongs to the Browns. He's not worried  
about fans who consider him a traitor for making the move to 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's entitled to their own opinion,'' he said. ``I  
guess if anything, I'm guilty by association.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mack, a 6-foot-3, 250-pound offensive guard, grew up in  
Cleveland, but went on to an All-American career at the University 
of Michigan. Drafted No. 2 overall in the 1966 draft, he went on to 
play all of his 13 seasons with the Los Angeles Rams -- going 184 
games without missing a game due to injury or illness. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's truly exciting to literally feel like you're going back  
home to Ohio,'' Mack said soon after finding out about his 
induction. 
</P>
<P>
	He had to wait 11 years to finally get the call to Canton, while  
Shaw -- a starring offensive guard for the Buffalo Bills from 1961 
to 1969 -- waited almost three times that. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were only three guards in the hall. Now he and I make  
five,'' Shaw said. ``I can't explain to you why more guards haven't 
made it into the Hall of Fame. But it's an honor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor and Dickerson didn't have to wait at all. Both were  
elected in their first year of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	They have more than that in common. Taylor, who played from 1981  
to 1993 with the Giants, and Dickerson, who spent time with four 
teams and amassed seven 1,000-yard rushing seasons with the Rams 
and Indianapolis Colts, were also known for their off-the-field 
exploits. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor has encountered legal, financial and substance-abuse  
problems since retiring. He has referred to those who didn't vote 
for his induction as ``old phonies'' not fit to judge him. 
</P>
<P>
	There was never any doubt about his fitness as a player.  
</P>
<P>
	``If there ever was a Superman in the NFL,'' former Washington  
quarterback Joe Theismann said, ``I think he wore No. 56 for the 
Giants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dickerson frequently wrangled with management during his playing  
days. Contentious contract negotiations led to his trade from the 
Rams to the Colts. While in Indianapolis, he was suspended for 
refusing to take a team physical and for refusing to practice. The 
Colts eventually met his demand to be traded. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite 13,259 career yards, Dickerson feels his induction  
confirms that he is acknowledged for what he did on the field and 
not any of the other headlines he made off it. 
</P>
<P>
	``That'll be a proud moment for me,'' he said recently. ``I  
never made it to a Super Bowl. ``For me, this shows I did do 
something right in my sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dickerson will be presented by one of his Ram blockers, Jackie  
Slater. Mack followed suit in choosing a Rams teammate and 
offensive lineman, Ken Iman, as his presenter. Taylor will be 
introduced by his 17-year-old son, T.J., and Shaw by a former Bills 
trainer.

<HEADLINE> Settlement in Kennedy Video Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The syndicators of ``Entertainment Tonight''  
agreed to settle a dispute that began when Fox accused the show of 
stealing exclusive video of John F. Kennedy Jr., the network said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox spokeswoman Karen Federock refused to disclose terms of the  
deal, which is believed to include a monetary payment from 
Paramount to avoid a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	A Paramount spokeswoman had no immediate comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Following Kennedy's fatal plane crash last month, Fox reportedly  
paid a stringer $10,000 for video footage of a Kennedy family party 
on the Fourth of July in 1998. The video showed Kennedy playing 
with children and his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, doing 
handstands on the grass at the Kennedy compound. 
</P>
<P>
	The tape was run on ``Fox Files'' and Fox News Channel.  
Afterward, the syndicated programs ``Access Hollywood,'' ``Extra'' 
and ``Entertainment Tonight'' asked for permission to use snippets 
of the video, said a Fox executive, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox denied the request from ``Entertainment Tonight'' because it  
was angry at how it had been treated by the syndicated show in the 
past, but said yes to its two competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Entertainment Tonight'' reportedly used the video anyway,  
taped from Fox News Channel. 
</P>
<P>
	Video piracy is a touchy subject among television news  
operations on hot stories, particularly since satellite dishes can 
give different networks access to materials that a competitor views 
as exclusive property. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox and Paramount lawyers began discussing a settlement after  
Fox threatened to sue the syndicators for use of the video.

	Tony Gwynn Gets 3,000th Hit  
</P>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Tony Gwynn of the San Diego Padres got his  
3,000th career hit tonight, singling in his first at-bat against 
the Montreal Expos and becoming the 22nd major leaguer to reach 
that milestone. Gwynn reached down and golfed a soft line drive 
past second base on a 1-2 pitch from Montreal's Dan Smith, a rookie 
right-hander making his 11th career start. Fireworks, usually 
reserved for Expos' home runs, were set off as soon as the hit 
dropped in, and Gwynn's mother, Vendella, celebrating her 64th 
birthday, came onto to the field and embraced her son.

	Drought Threatening Businesses  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The mid-summer drought is threatening to  
cripple businesses and communities that depend on devastated farm 
economies, President Clinton said today. The drought is the worst 
ever for farmers in Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey and Rhode 
Island, the president said. Maryland and New Jersey have imposed 
state water restrictions. Officials say the drought has not 
affected commodity and consumer prices because it is not affecting 
the large growing regions of the Midwest and California. But, being 
concentrated in the East, the dry period has been hard on smaller 
farmers.

permanent peace accord by February, a senior aide to Palestinian 
leader Yasser Arafat said. Once the outline was completed, Israel 
would carry out the last phase of the long-overdue interim Wye

Rahim, in offering the most detailed description yet of Israeli

heart problems she blames on the diet drug combination fen-phen, 
the company's attorney Bob Schick said today. Debbie Lovett, 36, 
was awarded $23 million in the first such lawsuit to reach a jury. 
Lovett claims she suffered heart-valve problems after taking the 
drugs for more than three months, starting in October 1995. ``This

	Aetna Buys Prudential Healthcare

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Aetna Inc. completed its purchase of Prudential  
Health Care today to become the nation's largest health maintenance 
organization. The deal was consummated when New Jersey today became 
the last state to approve the merger. As several states have done, 
New Jersey forced Aetna to meet several conditions, including 
promising to keep 90 percent of Prudential's doctors for the next 
three years. The American Medical Association and physician groups 
nationwide argued the merger would create a monopoly in several 
cities, severely limiting health insurance choices forcing doctors 
to accept lower fees.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While all taxpayers would get some benefit if  
the Republican tax cut were the law today, married couples earning 
less than $100,000 would get the biggest percentage reduction. The 
10-year, $792 billion tax cut approved by Congress would have 
widely different effects on individual taxpayers, depending on 
their marital status, number of children, investments and claimed 
deductions, according to an analysis by the Deloitte &AMP; Touche 
accounting firm. President Clinton vowed today that the 
Republicans' tax cut bill is too large and won't become law.

<HEADLINE> Capers, Coughlin Rivals No More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Neither Tom Coughlin nor his new  
defensive coordinator, Dom Capers, have time to talk about irony. 
They're too busy trying to build a defense capable of taking the 
Jacksonville Jaguars to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	For the two coaches, it has been an offseason filled with proof  
of what strange bedfellows their profession can create. 
</P>
<P>
	Coughlin hired Capers, who had been fired by the Carolina  
Panthers after last season. Thus formed the partnership of two 
coaches who stood as counterparts -- some said rivals -- five years 
ago, when both their teams entered the league as expansion 
franchises. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding yet another twist: Capers' first game as the Jaguars  
defensive coordinator comes next Friday against, who else, the 
Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this business, after you've been around for a while,  
nothing surprises you,'' Capers said. ``The key is taking your 
situation and trying to surround yourself with quality people who 
have the same commitment that you do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That attitude is what lured Coughlin toward Capers when the  
Jaguars' former defensive coordinator, Dick Jauron, was hired as 
head coach of the Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
	Coughlin was looking for someone who could teach a more  
aggressive style to a defense that has been consistently mediocre. 
In Capers, he gets the master of the zone-blitz schemes that have 
become so popular in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Capers who melded the Pittsburgh Steelers defense from  
1992-94, when it gave up fewer points than any in the NFL, and 
helped make stars out of players like Kevin Greene, Levon Kirkland 
and Carnell Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jacksonville really decided to beef up the defense,'' said  
Lake, the free-agent safety who is reunited with Capers in 
Jacksonville. ``You know we're going to play aggressively under Dom 
Capers. That's going to make us very competitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coughlin says his familiarity with Capers dates to well before  
he became the Panthers head coach and so many comparisons between 
the two men began. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an excellent coach,'' Coughlin said. ``I've known of him  
and tracked him since he came into league. When Dick Jauron took 
the Chicago job, it was a natural to at least see if there was any 
interest there, because Dom is a quality coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coughlin rarely allows interviews with his assistants, so fans  
in Jacksonville won't get much of a chance to see the real Capers. 
They're missing glimpses of a genuinely friendly man, who was 
plagued by several incidents in Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Early last season, quarterback Kerry Collins told Capers he  
thought the team would be better off if someone else was the 
starter. Soon after, Collins was waived. 
</P>
<P>
	There was the game in which Kevin Greene hit a defensive coach  
on a sideline and another where running back Fred Lane grabbed his 
crotch during a touchdown celebration. By the end of the 4-12 
season, Capers appeared to have lost control of the team and the 
Panthers management felt it had to go in another direction. 
</P>
<P>
	Capers' arrival in Jacksonville appears not to be long-term.  
While he's expected to get another head coaching job, he doesn't 
like to discuss his prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I started coaching, I took the philosophy that you can't  
ever look too far down the road,'' he said. ``A lot of people want 
to do that for you. But if you start planning one, two, three years 
ahead, you get in trouble. I just try to take it day-by-day and try 
to do the very best I can that day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some days it's hard not to look back.  
</P>
<P>
	Like Saturday, when the team travels to Greenville, S.C., to  
scrimmage the Falcons. A huge contingent of North Carolina media 
will be there to talk to him for the first time since he left. 
</P>
<P>
	Another will come in the preseason opener against the Panthers,  
then again on Sept. 19, when the Jaguars travel to Carolina to play 
the Panthers in their regular-season home opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Capers has made a promise to himself to not let any of the  
awkward situations bother him. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just try to keep emotion out of it as much as possible,''  
he said. ``I came down here, I'm a Jaguar now and I've got to focus 
all my energy on that. Any time you waste thinking about anything 
else is just that -- wasted time.''

<HEADLINE> Cocaine Charges for Commander's Wife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The wife of an Army colonel who oversaw the  
U.S. military's counternarcotics operations in Colombia faces 
charges of shipping cocaine to the United States, U.S. officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Laurie Hiett, wife of Army Col. James Hiett, was charged in June  
with conspiracy to distribute narcotics after the U.S. Customs 
Service found parcels containing cocaine, including one package in 
New York that carried Mrs. Hiett's name as its return address, the 
officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A warrant for her arrest has been issued by the U.S. Eastern  
District Court in New York, according to Navy Lt. Jane Campbell, a 
spokeswoman for the U.S. Southern Command in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	James Hiett was U.S. military group commander at the U.S.  
Embassy in Bogota at the time. In that job, he was in charge of all 
U.S. military activities in Colombia, including counterdrug 
operations, according to Col. Ron Williams, a Southern Command 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said Hiett requested to be removed from the post after  
the allegations arose and his transfer is pending. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigation by the Army Criminal Investigation Division in  
Panama found ``no prior knowledge'' by Hiett of cocaine shipments 
to the United States involving his wife, Williams said. The 
investigation cleared Hiett of any involvement in criminal 
activity, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams referred a reporter to the New York prosecutor's office  
for information about Mrs. Hiett. 
</P>
<P>
	The Village Voice newspaper reported on its Internet Web site  
Thursday that a search warrant application said Mrs. Hiett admitted 
to federal investigators she had mailed six packages for ``her 
husband's chauffeur,'' but claimed that she did not know the 
contents of the parcels. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 23, according to the Village Voice, one of those parcels  
was searched by U.S. Customs agents in Miami and was found to 
contain 2.7 pounds of cocaine. Later a second parcel was 
intercepted in New York and also found to contain cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	The first package carried Mrs. Hiett's name as its return  
address and was mailed from Bogota, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombia ranks third on the list of U.S. aid recipients with  
$289 million earmarked for counterdrug activity this year. Barry 
McCaffrey, the White House drug control chief, said recently an 
additional $1 billion was needed because current efforts were 
falling short. He said the situation had reached ``emergency'' 
proportions. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug war also is costing the United States in other ways:  
Five U.S. soldiers were killed two weeks ago when their U.S. Army 
spy plane crashed into a Colombian mountainside while on a 
counternarcotics mission.

<HEADLINE> Blast at Texas Hotel Injures Dozens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAPEVINE, Texas (AP) -- A fireball exploded Friday over the  
swimming pool of a newly-opened hotel near Dallas-Fort Worth 
International Airport, seriously burning at least one person and 
lacerating dozens with broken glass. 
</P>
<P>
	No fatalities were reported, there was no fire after the initial  
blast and police said nobody had been trapped in the rubble. The 
hotel's manger said a natural gas line could have been responsible, 
but a utility spokeswoman at the scene said she did not think gas 
was involved. 
</P>
<P>
	The blast took place shortly before 7 p.m. in a ground floor  
equipment room of the Embassy Suites Outdoor World hotel, which had 
opened Tuesday but remained under construction. 
</P>
<P>
	John Kline Jr., 12, of Atlanta, said he was playing video games  
next door to the equipment room when he heard the blast. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just stopped what I was doing and ran,'' he said. As he  
fled, he was hit in the head by a metal rod. He was treated at the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
	A Texarkana woman was in a glass elevator overlooking the pool  
when the explosion took place. ``I saw people just running and 
panicking,'' Stacie Duncan said. ``I saw children with glass stuck 
in their legs screaming for their parents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Bretches, the hotel manager, said the facility had 600  
guests and 200 employees. Everybody was accounted for, he said. 
Bretches said the guests and their belongings would be transferred 
to other hotels in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Bretches said the pool heater had been turned off and was being  
serviced by a subcontractor, who was the most severely hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	That man was airlifted to Parkland Health &AMP; Hospital System for  
treatment of second-degree burns over his face and arms. It was 
believed he had entered the equipment room, carrying a compressed 
gas tank, just before the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	David Anderson of the Grapevine Fire Department said eight  
others had been transported to hospitals for treatment of cuts and 
burns. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of other people are being treated by paramedics at the  
scene for cuts caused by flying glass.

<HEADLINE>  Most Asian Stock Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets ended the week lower  
Friday despite an overnight rally on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed  
273.95 points, or 1.58 percent, to close at 17,084.24. On Thursday, 
the average slid 327.19 points, or 1.85 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo share prices fell for a third straight day as Japanese and  
overseas investors dumped stocks amid persistent worries about the 
yen's strength against the U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	That concern left many investors bearish in Tokyo despite an  
overnight rise on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial 
average advanced 119.05 points, or 1.1 percent, to 10,793.82 at 
Thursday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar was quoted at 114.28 yen, down  
0.34 yen from its level of 114.62 yen late Thursday in Tokyo and 
below its late New York level of 114.30 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Philippine shares slumped on worries over a possible rise in  
U.S. and domestic interest rates, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Continuing monsoon rains and floods in metropolitan Manila and  
nearby provinces, which left at least 87 people dead, also 
discouraged the Philippine stock market, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's apprehension that the floods could hamper the  
country's economic recovery,'' said Gonzalo Bongolan, research 
director for PCCI Securities Brokers Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philippine Stock Exchange index of 30 selected companies  
lost 49.60 points, or 2.1 percent, to 2,298.64. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Driver Was In Court Before Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GARY, Ind. (AP) -- The man charged with drunken driving in the  
death of Purdue basketball star Tiffany Young had been in court on 
a public intoxication charge hours before the accident, a newspaper 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnold Eaton walked out of court July 31 after a judge refused  
to let him plead guilty, telling him to talk to a lawyer, the Gary 
Post-Tribune reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve hours later, Young was killed when the car in which she  
was riding was struck by a drunken driver. Eaton, a 33-year-old 
Navy seaman from Great Lakes, Ill., was charged with operating a 
vehicle while intoxicated, causing a death, and is free on bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Young was buried Thursday in Hillsboro, Ala.  
</P>
<P>
	Eaton was in court the day of the accident on a misdemeanor  
public intoxication charge stemming from an April 20 incident. City 
Judge Pro Tem Itsia Rivera reversed his plea for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He initially pled guilty and didn't understand that it could  
mean his discharge from the military,'' City Judge Karen 
Freeman-Wilson said. ``When he was questioned, he was given the 
opportunity to change his plea so he could seek the assistance of 
counsel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman-Wilson said Rivera's action reflected an ordinary court  
action. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people don't seem to understand implications of their  
guilty plea, we'll do that,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Alabama, Young was remembered Thursday by friends and family  
members as a vibrant young woman with strong religious faith. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,200 people, including some of her teammates from the  
1999 national championship squad, attended her funeral at Wheeler 
Chapel Full Gospel Baptist Church in her hometown. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tiffany is not dead,'' said her father, Billy Young, standing  
by her casket at the front of the church. ``I'm sure you're looking 
up here and can see she's not moving, but she's not dead. I remind 
you -- you're just looking at the house where she used to live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue team members rode a chartered bus from West Lafayette to  
Hillsboro. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was a teammate, friend and sister in Christ,'' Purdue  
teammate Camille Cooper said. ``Tiffany, I pray that you continue 
to pray for us because we will continue to pray for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young's boyfriend, Neil Sinclair, was still recuperating from  
injuries suffered in the accident and could not attend the funeral. 
He was driving the car.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton: States Seeing Worst Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The current drought is the worst ever recorded  
for agriculture in four Northeastern states, and it threatens to 
cripple businesses and communities that depend on devastated farm 
economies, President Clinton said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Throughout much of this country, we have seen the worst  
drought since the Dust Bowl days,'' Clinton said today before 
leaving the White House for a weekend trip to Arkansas and 
Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	The drought is the worst ever for farmers in Maryland, Delaware,  
New Jersey and Rhode Island, the president said. Maryland and New 
Jersey have imposed state water restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Such a natural calamity can have devastating consequences, not  
only for farmers, but for small businesses and communities that 
depend upon a thriving agricultural sector; and for the electric 
power system so vital to our nation,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the government has worked hard to help  
drought-stricken farmers, but ``we must do more. It is our duty as 
a national community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Some parts of the country are in the grips of a drought of  
historic proportions,'' Deputy Commerce Secretary Robert L. Mallett 
said at a news briefing. 
</P>
<P>
	And there was little promise for relief.  
</P>
<P>
	Many parts of the East are eight to 18 inches below the normal  
rainfall over the last year and while the outlook is for a return 
to normal rainfall, that will not make up the deficit, said James 
Baker, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``This drought did not happen overnight ... and it will take a  
long time to be alleviated,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At another briefing today, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman  
said the drought has not affected commodity and consumer prices 
because it is not impacting the large growing regions of the 
Midwest and California. 
</P>
<P>
	But by being concentrated in the East, the dry period has been  
particularly hard on smaller farmers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House will convene a task force of affected federal  
agencies ``to coordinate our efforts and focus our attack on this 
problem,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also said he thinks Congress will come through with  
emergency farm money soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``There needs to be a special provision to deal with the drought  
crisis, and I hope ... and believe that there will be,'' Clinton 
said in response to a reporter's question about criticism of the 
administration's efforts so far. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish we could have done it before the August recess,''  
Clinton said, referring to a vacation break in Congress, ``But I 
think it will be there in time to aid the farmers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate approved $7.4 billion in emergency farm aid on  
Wednesday. The House will consider an emergency aid package after 
the recess.

<HEADLINE>  Most Asian Stock Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets ended the week lower  
Friday despite an overnight rally on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed  
273.95 points, or 1.58 percent, to close at 17,084.24. On Thursday, 
the average slid 327.19 points, or 1.85 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo share prices fell for a third straight day as Japanese and  
overseas investors dumped stocks amid persistent worries about the 
yen's strength against the U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	That concern left many investors bearish in Tokyo despite an  
overnight rise on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial 
average advanced 119.05 points, or 1.1 percent, to 10,793.82 at 
Thursday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar was quoted at 114.28 yen, down  
0.34 yen from its level of 114.62 yen late Thursday in Tokyo and 
below its late New York level of 114.30 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Philippine shares slumped on worries over a possible rise in  
U.S. and domestic interest rates, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Continuing monsoon rains and floods in metropolitan Manila and  
nearby provinces, which left at least 87 people dead, also 
discouraged the Philippine stock market, they said.

country's economic recovery,'' said Gonzalo Bongolan, research 
director for PCCI Securities Brokers Corp.

<HEADLINE> Senate Seeks To Aid Tobacco Growers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The drought may have spared them, but tobacco  
growers say they deserve federal aid just as much as their 
neighbors who grow corn or soybeans. And the Senate wants to give 
it to them. 
</P>
<P>
	A Senate-approved $7.4 billion package to assist farmers hit by  
low prices and bad weather includes $328 million earmarked for 
tobacco growers. They say the cash will help compensate for the 
money they're losing from declining cigarette sales and lagging 
exports. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tobacco farmers have their backs against the wall in terms of  
this agricultural crisis as much as any other farmers,'' Larry 
Wooten, a North Carolina grower, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	But critics say tobacco isn't just any crop.  
</P>
<P>
	``This was a step backwards,'' said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill.  
``It certainly is inconsistent for us to be subsidizing tobacco 
while we tell people how dangerous it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Durbin and other senators say they had no choice but to go along  
with the tobacco money because they didn't want to delay passage of 
the farm aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders put the money in the farm assistance package  
at the request of senators from tobacco growing states. Most of the 
money in the legislation, about $6 billion, would go to grain and 
soybean growers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department, which stabilizes tobacco prices by  
regulating production, cut back sharply on how much tobacco farmers 
could grow this year because of declining domestic and foreign 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The quotas were reduced by 29 percent for burley tobacco and 17  
percent for flue-cured. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is putting a lot of farmers in a financial bind,'' said  
Blake Brown, an agricultural economist at North Carolina State 
University. ``They can't grow or sell tobacco without a quota.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco growers will share in a $5.2 billion trust fund that's  
being set up by cigarette companies to compensate them for 
declining cigarette sales, and growers also are likely to get a 
share of the industry's $206 billion settlement with state 
governments. But money from the trust fund won't start flowing 
before next year, and farmers say they need help now. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the emergency aid package, other farmers are getting  
compensated for lost income, and I felt that tobacco farmers should 
too,'' said Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. ``While prices for other 
commodities will rise in the future, the income lost due to the cut 
in tobacco quota will not return.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Senate bill, the $328 million would be distributed  
according to the same formula as the trust funds, which has yet to 
be finalized. That money is likely to go to quota owners, who don't 
necessarily farm themselves, as well as growers. 
</P>
<P>
	The House version of the agriculture spending bill for fiscal  
2000, which starts Oct. 1, has no money for tobacco farmers. A 
House-Senate conference committee will work out the final version 
of the farm-assistance package after lawmakers return in September 
from a monthlong recess. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it will survive,'' Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D.,  
said of the tobacco money. ``I don't think the United States as a 
policy wants to be supporting tobacco.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Antismoking groups have been trying to persuade tobacco farmers  
to plant other crops. The Senate aid won't help that cause, ``but 
the farm economy is in such a bad state that telling them to switch 
to something else like corn or soybeans doesn't make sense,'' said 
Scott Ballin of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd like to see this money to go to other uses, like buying  
out quotas or economic development funds,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Smog Mars Vacation Spots, Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Escaping to the shore or the mountains for a  
summer vacation doesn't ensure you'll be getting away to cleaner 
air, environmentalists say. 
</P>
<P>
	``The heat wave has turned into a smog wave,'' said Conrad  
Schneider, an official of the Clean Air Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
	During the first half of the summer, some of America's favorite  
vacation hideaways had as much smoggy air as the cities people were 
trying to escape, according to statistics presented Thursday by the 
task force and other groups. The report relied largely on state and 
federal air quality statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether on Cape Cod or at the Indiana Dunes, in the Great Smoky  
Mountain National Park or on Maryland's Eastern Shore, smog has 
been a problem on many days this summer, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Air pollution in national parks and other rural vacation spots  
is nothing new. For years, some parks have had serious haze and 
smog problems because of pollution that can drift hundreds of miles 
through the air from power plants and other sources. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, the Clinton administration announced a plan to cut air  
pollution in 37 national parks and 119 wilderness areas. The goal 
was to bring air in those vacation spots to pristine levels by the 
middle of the next century. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Billings of the American Lung Association said smog-filled  
air is particularly hard on people with asthma, including children 
who ``should be enjoying their summer vacations, not grabbing for 
asthma inhalers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The environmental groups, examining air quality data from April  
1 to July 25 found, for example: 
</P>
<P>
	--The northern tip of Cape Cod had 11 dirty air days, compared  
with four for downtown Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	--Acadia National Park on the Maine coast had about the same  
amount of smoggy days as Philadelphia., 
</P>
<P>
	--The Hamptons on New York's Long Island had the same bad air  
days as Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Indiana Dunes on Lake Michigan had more dirty air days than  
Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	--Small towns along the Blue Ridge Parkway near Asheville, N.C.,  
reported air pollution levels on par with downtown Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Great Smoky Mountain National Park had dirtier air on some  
days than any city in the South, except Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The groups said that in the 32 states examined between April 1  
and July 25, the levels of ozone, or smog, exceeded federal 
standards on 85 days in some parts of the 32 states -- a total of 
2,743 such instances.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Down on Weather / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean and corn futures prices continued their  
downward fall in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade 
amid forecasts for weekend rain in parts of the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures -- which have often followed corn and soybeans  
through their ups and downs in the past few weeks -- also fell. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooler temperatures have moved into the Midwest growing region  
in a week that has also seen more tempered movement in grains 
futures prices. Hot, dry temperatures during the late July heat 
wave had caused prices to skyrocket on reports of crop damage. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts say, even now, rains could help improve yields --  
driving prices down. 
</P>
<P>
	In early trading today, wheat for December delivery fell 1 1/2  
cents to $2.93 a bushel; December corn was down 3 1/4 cents to $2.31 3/4 
a bushel; December oats fell a penny to $1.16 1/2 a bushel; and 
November soybeans dropped 8 3/4 cents to $4.71 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, beef and livestock futures were mixed in early  
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle rose .38 cent to 64.80 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle were up .38 cent to 76.80 cents a pound; August lean 
hogs fell .17 cent to 50.15 cents a pound; and August pork bellies 
were up 2.73 cents to 56.45 cents a pound.

took the day off from his job as a restaurant manager to watch the 
game free at the Padres' home ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn smacked a line drive past second base in the first inning  
of San Diego's 12-10 win over the Expos to become the 22nd player 
to reach the milestone. He finished the game 4-for-5 to move his 
career-hit total to 3,003. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a fan of baseball and the Padres, I hope this is a moment  
he'll always remember,'' Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many fans either skipped work or took off early to see Gwynn hit  
the big one on a giant-screen television at Qualcomm, where 
fireworks were set off following Gwynn's hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Others crowded into sports bars or living rooms for a more cozy  
view of the afternoon game at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Horton was at the ballpark Thursday hoping for a double  
dose of baseball history -- Mark McGwire hit his 500th career home 
run against the Padres in St. Louis. Gwynn went 1-for-4 against the 
Cardinals, leaving him one hit shy of 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I'm glad he got it tonight. It was great!'' said Horton,  
who temporarily colored his crew-cut hair for the occasion. He 
bleached it and then fashioned ``3K'' on the top of his head in 
orange and blue hair dye. 
</P>
<P>
	Billy Howe of the Pacific Beach community has kept a tally for  
the neighborhood in his yard on a giant chalkboard, counting down 
the last ten hits. He has now set his attention towards 4,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is for Tony,'' Howe said. ``He won't toot his own horn so  
we'll do it for him.''

<HEADLINE> Tony Gwynn Gets 3,000th Hit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Tony Gwynn got his 3,000th career hit Friday  
night, singling in his first at-bat against the Montreal Expos to 
become the 22nd major leaguer to reach that milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn reached down and golfed a soft line drive past second base  
on a 1-2 pitch from Dan Smith, a rookie right-hander making his 
11th career start. His Padres teammates raced from the dugout to 
congratulate him, and first base umpire Kerwin Danley -- Gwynn's 
college teammate at San Diego State -- gave him a hug. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time in 20 years that a NL player reached 3,000  
hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Fireworks, usually reserved for Expos' home runs, were set off  
as soon as the hit dropped in, and Gwynn's mother, Vendella, 
celebrating her 64th birthday, came onto to the field and embraced 
her son. 
</P>
<P>
	The hit came six years to the day since Gwynn got his 2,000th  
career hit against Colorado's Bruce Ruffin. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of 13,540 at Olympic Stadium, which was on its feet and  
clapping throughout the at-bat, gave Gwynn a lengthy ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	The ball and the first base bag were taken out of play, with one  
or both likely to end up in the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn didn't wait long to add on. In his second at-bat, he  
singled up the middle to move past Roberto Clemente into 21st place 
on the career list. 
</P>
<P>
	After grounding out in the fourth inning, Gwynn singled to right  
in the sixth and singled to right in the eighth before leaving for 
a pinch-runner. The crowd gave him another standing ovation after 
his 3,003rd hit. Al Kaline is next on the career list with 3,007. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn's milestone hit came one night after he played in St.  
Louis and witnessed Mark McGwire's 500th career home run. Gwynn 
went 1-for-4 against the Cardinals, leaving him one hit shy of 
3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In a pregame interview, Gwynn said he was not nervous for his  
first at-bat as he was Thursday night against the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to get it done,'' Gwynn said after Thursday  
night's game. ``I just want to get a hit. It's down to one little 
hit. One hit. Chinker, blooper, line drive, just one hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn became the first NL player since the Cardinals' Lou Brock  
in 1979 to reach 3,000 hits. Brock was at Thursday night's game in 
St. Louis, as was Stan Musial, hoping to see Gwynn reach 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Several AL players -- Paul Molitor, Eddie Murray, George Brett,  
Robin Yount, Dave Winfield, Carl Yastrzemski and Rod Carew -- 
reached 3,000 hits in the years since Brock did it. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn reached 3,000 in 2,284 games, third-fastest behind only Ty  
Cobb and Nap Lajoie. Cobb was the fastest, doing it in 2,135 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn got what he wanted quickly against the Expos, becoming the  
first major leaguer to get hit No. 3,000 outside the United States. 
Pete Rose got his 4,000th hit in Montreal as a member of the Expos. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn, 39, has played for the Padres throughout his 18-year  
career, and has hit better than .300 for 16 straight seasons. He is 
tied for Honus Wagner with eight NL batting titles, and hit No. 
3,000 upped this season's average to .319. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn got his first two hits in his major league debut on July  
19, 1982, playing against Rose, and wanted to get No. 3,000 quickly 
so he could beat Wade Boggs to the mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs had 2,997 hits going into Friday night's home game for  
Tampa Bay against Cleveland, was 0-for-3 with one walk in his first 
four plate appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	This is one of the greatest milestone weeks in baseball history,  
a 500th homer and the possibility of two 3,000th hits. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time those two plateaus were reached so close together  
was in 1970 when Ernie Banks hit his 500th homer and Hank Aaron had 
his 3,000th hit within five days of each other.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Slide; Dow Ends Down 79.79 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks resumed their slide Friday as a  
report of strong U.S. employment solidified Wall Street's belief 
that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates later this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 79.79 points to close at  
10,714.03, erasing more than half its 119-point gain on Thursday. 
The blue-chip index ended a choppy week 58.08 points higher, a gain 
of 0.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators fell modestly Friday, capping a week of  
steep losses. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 13.42 to 1,300.29, and 
the Nasdaq composite index fell 17.86 to 2,547.97. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq is now 11 percent below its record high of 2,864.48,  
reached July 16. Traditionally, Wall Street calls a market drop of 
10 percent a correction. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks tumbled after the Labor Department reported that  
employers added a larger-than-expected 310,000 jobs to their 
payrolls in July and that average hourly earnings, a key gauge of 
inflation pressures, rose 3.8 percent from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors have grown increasingly worried that tight labor  
markets will force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates as a 
pre-emptive strike against inflation. Higher interest rates cut 
into corporate profits by raising the cost of borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Fed needed fuel to consider raising rates, they have it  
now with these new numbers,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior vice 
president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. ``The strong jobs report tilted the 
optimists upside down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department also reported the unemployment rate  
remained at 4.3 percent last month, near a three-decade low. 
</P>
<P>
	``That pace of job growth in unacceptable to the Fed,'' said  
Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices fell sharply on the report, pushing the yield on  
Treasury's 30-year bond up to 6.15 percent from 6.04 percent late 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest rate concerns hurt financial services stocks, as J.P.  
Morgan fell 2 9/16 to 122 15/16 and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter 
dropped 4 9/16 to 82 1/8. American Express, down 4 1/16 to 123 1/16, 
contributed most heavily to the Dow's losses. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stock market is trying really hard to fight reality right  
now -- interest rates will probably be rising,'' said Brian G. 
Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co., in 
Kansas City, Mo. ``But some sectors can't escape the selling 
pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Certain technology issues did escape the selloff, most notably  
semiconductor stocks like Micron Technology, up 4 1/2 at 65 7/8. Strong 
forecasts for personal computer sales have supported the stocks of 
companies that make computer parts, and an industry group said 
Thursday worldwide semiconductors sales in June rose 13.6 percent 
from June 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	But Internet companies, which rallied sharply Thursday,  
struggled once again. Yahoo! lost 1 7/16 to 126 15/16 despite a 
ratings upgrade from Goldman Sachs. America Online gave up 
significant early gains to end 13/16 higher, at 84 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	EBay, the online auction site, plunged 9 5/8 to 83 1/4 as its system  
shut down. 
</P>
<P>
	While most market indexes ended the week fairly flat amid low  
volume, trading was volatile throughout the week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough to call all the turns in this market,'' Ackerman  
said. ``It is like the Indianapolis 500. Everything keeps changing 
lap after lap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange. Composite volume totaled 850.17 million 
shares, compared with 1.04 billion in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 6.35 to 611.04, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.83 to 777.92. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.71 to 428.04. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.57 percent. European indexes  
were mixed, as Germany's DAX index rose 0.6 percent, Britain's 
FT-SE 100 was up 0.3 percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 0.4 
percent lower.

<HEADLINE> Montana Rep. Rick Hill To Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- Citing problems with his eyes stemming from  
a failed operation, Rep. Rick Hill announced Friday he will not 
seek a third term as Montana's congressman next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just apparent to me that I've got to focus on two  
things: fulfilling the duties of the office and bringing some 
stability to my eye problems. I just don't see how I can run for 
re-election and do that,'' Hill, a Republican, said in a telephone 
interview from his U.S. Capitol office. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the 52-year-old Hill, the state's only House  
member, added, ``I believe I owe it to the people of Montana who 
have temporarily entrusted me to represent them, not to commit to a 
job I may not be able to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He underwent radial keratotomy four years ago. The procedure  
corrects nearsightedness by slicing the cornea with a knife or 
shaving it with a laser to flatten it. But in Hill's case there 
were complications -- scar tissue formed on the cornea, blurring his 
vision. 
</P>
<P>
	Follow-up operations have not corrected the scarring and in some  
ways have made his eyes worse, Hill has said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill was first elected in 1996, when longtime Democratic Rep.  
Pat Williams retired. Hill was re-elected in 1998, and his bid for 
a third term had been widely presumed. He said Friday he's 
confident the Montana GOP will retain the seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill, a wealthy insurance executive before entering politics,  
has characterized himself as ``a common-sense conservative'' and 
generally follows the GOP line in his House votes, although last 
year he voted for a campaign-finance reform bill opposed by most of 
his fellow Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	He voted for the three articles of impeachment against President  
Clinton that passed the House last December and voted against a 
fourth article that failed to pass. The Senate later acquitted 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill has also voted consistently against gun control.

<HEADLINE> Hacker Vandalizes Security Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the high-tech equivalent of a thief  
burglarizing police headquarters, a hacker vandalized a prominent 
Internet site devoted to computer security using an unusually 
clever tactic. 
</P>
<P>
	The embarrassing electronic assault against the AntiOnline site  
Thursday occurred days after other hackers altered the Web site for 
Symantec Corp., whose software is used by millions of consumers to 
protect against viruses and electronic snoops. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest incident, a hacker using an Internet account in  
Russia successfully tricked the site's computer to load hidden 
software code from elsewhere onto one of its own Web pages, called 
``Eye on the Underground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The site was fixed just over an hour later, but this week's  
attacks raised questions about Internet security: If organizations 
that clearly are aware of potential security problems can't protect 
their sites, how can the rest of the Internet? 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no absolute security,'' said James Adams, chief  
executive officer of Infrastructure Defense Inc., which works to 
protect companies against hackers. ``All you can do is try to keep 
ahead of the game. For anybody to claim they're totally secure, 
it's not true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the hacker never directly infiltrated AntiOnline's own  
computers, the hidden code redirected visitors to a Web page with 
the image of an unblinking eye along with the message ``expensive 
security systems do not protect from stupidity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't call it sophisticated, but I'd call it clever,''  
acknowledged John ``JP'' Vranesevich, who runs AntiOnline in 
Beaver, Pa., a popular site specializing in news about hackers and 
security. 
</P>
<P>
	The affected AntiOnline page was designed to automatically  
collect and display messages posted to an online discussion group 
at another Internet site popular among hackers. 
</P>
<P>
	But someone using the Internet account traced to Russia slipped  
hidden computer code into the text of one of those messages, which 
was then automatically loaded onto AntiOnline's site and sabotaged 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams said Web sites specializing in computer security need to  
take greater precautions because successful attacks against these 
computers can carry greater glory among the underground hacking 
community. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are brownie points to be gained,'' Adams said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Do we need better education? Yes,'' agreed Russ Cooper of  
NTBugtraq, a popular Internet discussion group about computer 
security. ``Do we need better tools? Yes. Does that mean I'm never 
going to suffer an attack? No. 
</P>
<P>
	``There isn't a piece of software you double-click to set up and  
it's secure,'' Cooper said. ``You have to have staff and policy, 
and you have to have monitoring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vranesevich, who was demonized by some hackers when he announced  
over the summer that AntiOnline would help authorities trace and 
prosecute computer attacks, noted that other Web site operators 
weren't as vulnerable to the same technique that affected his site. 
</P>
<P>
	``We sort of caused it ourselves,'' he said. ``We visit the  
hacker sites dynamically, and that is the type of scenario your 
average system administrator probably wouldn't encounter. We're 
doing things far more obscure.''

<HEADLINE> Packers' Mayes Settles Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Jerry Dominiack, who sued five former  
Notre Dame players and his former bookkeeper to recover embezzled 
funds, reached a settlement Friday with former Irish receiver 
Derrick Mayes. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayes' attorney, Gregory Hahn, said the settlement with  
Dominiack was for less than $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Hahn said he could not discuss details of the deal but noted  
that ``under no circumstances did Derrick admit any wrongdoing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayes, who now plays for the Green Bay Packers, was named in the  
suit to recover some of the more than $1.2 million that Kimberly 
Dunbar embezzled while working as a bookkeeper at Dominiack 
Mechanical Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunbar, who was sentenced to four years in prison last year but  
will be released in October, spent some of the money on up to a 
dozen current and former Irish players, including Mayes. 
</P>
<P>
	Court documents outline a number of gifts Dunbar purchased for  
Mayes, including a 1995 weekend trip to Las Vegas, a video camera, 
clothes and numerous meals. Hahn said Mayes did not know where 
Dunbar got the money she lavished on him. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunbar's contact with players sparked a school investigation  
that led to an appearance before the NCAA's Committee on 
Infractions in June. The university is still awaiting word from the 
board on whether it will face any sanctions for Dunbar's 
relationship with players. 
</P>
<P>
	The other former Notre Dame players named in the suit are Ray  
Zellars, Kinnon Tatum, Jarvis Edison and Lee Becton.

<HEADLINE> Automakers Told Service Is Key </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) -- Consumer-oriented services and  
marketing will set the top automakers apart in the coming years, 
rather than high-quality cars and trucks, a top industry analyst 
predicts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is absolutely necessary that you make great product, that  
you stay ahead of the competition, that you're innovative -- but 
that's not sufficient,'' John Casesa, first vice president of 
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co, said Friday at the University of Michigan's 
annual automotive conference. ``That's why the marketing concept 
becomes so important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Casesa cited the past decade's success of Toyota Motor Corp.'s  
Lexus luxury brand and General Motors Corp.'s Saturn small-car 
division. They have differentiated themselves in highly crowded 
market segments by providing a comfortable buying experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Other ways that automakers and their dealers already are setting  
themselves apart include keeping their stores open seven days a 
week, opening parts and service shops at night, and providing 
low-cost routine maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers also are looking to high-tech communications to  
provide future profits. GM is promoting its OnStar satellite 
navigation and aid service on its luxury cars; GM and Ford Motor 
Co. plan to offer subscription CD-quality radio service via 
satellite in the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
	There are several reasons why services will become even more  
important soon, Casesa said. High quality has become commonplace 
among competing makes; the glut of production capacity is growing, 
keeping prices down; and all automakers are getting faster at 
replacing aging models. 
</P>
<P>
	``The physical product is getting increasingly the same,'' he  
said. ``Lots of people make good cars and that is no longer 
sufficient to differentiate your company enough to earn premium 
returns.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Women's Soccer Team Wins Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Finally, the focus was back on the  
competition at the Pan American Games. 
</P>
<P>
	It was on the soccer field, where the U.S. women -- no, not that  
team, but the under-18 national squad -- won a gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	It was on the courts, tennis and basketball, where American Paul  
Goldstein won a gold medal and the U.S. women fell short again vs. 
Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	It was in the boxing ring, with two Americans getting to the  
finals. 
</P>
<P>
	And it was in the pool, where America's women got on track with  
two games records. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our spirit this meet has been tremendous, no matter how many  
medals we've gotten,'' Staciana Stitts, 17, of Carlsbad, Calif., 
said after leading a 1-2 U.S. finish in the 100-meter breaststroke 
with a Pan Ams record 1:09.16. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're strong now. People can say we've been disappointing  
because we're not winning gold, but we're swimming our best 
times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stitts also is strong ... mentally.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite being diagnosed with alopecia, which caused her hair to  
fall out when she was 12, Stitts has a bubbly, refreshing attitude. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's awesome,'' she said when asked about her disease, the  
cause of which is unknown. ``I'm so glad I'm in swimming. I don't 
know where I'd be without it. The sport is a big ego-booster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karen Campbell, 22, a black belt in taekwondo, gave the U.S.  
women a second gold medal, winning the 100 butterfly at 1:00.15, 
after setting a games record of 59.70 in the preliminaries. Prior 
to Thursday night, the Americans had only one gold in eight women's 
events. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my first major breakthrough,'' said Campbell, of  
Kalamazoo, Mich., and a fifth-year senior at Southern California. 
``Breaking one minute is a huge success for me. 
</P>
<P>
	``Taekwondo has helped me to focus in swimming, be disciplined  
and overcome the threshold of pain in training. Taekwondo was 
easier. I trained three times a week. In swimming, I train twice a 
day for three hours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's men increased its swimming gold-medal total to five by  
winning two races Thursday night. The Brazilians capped the 
competition by winning the 400 freestyle relay with a games record 
3:17.18, after Luiz Lima took the 400 freestyle in 3:52.25. 
</P>
<P>
	The other gold went to Canada's Morgan Knabe in the men's 200  
breaststroke at 2:14.73, another Pan Ams record. 
</P>
<P>
	Catherine Reddick made an uncanny series of moves to score the  
lone goal as the United States beat Mexico 1-0 for the soccer gold. 
Goalie Hope Solo, who plays at the University of Washington, had 11 
stops. Her fully extended block of a shot by Iris Mora in the 53rd 
minute and her diving save on a shot in the penalty area by Fatima 
Leyva in the 87th preserved the win. 
</P>
<P>
	They don't want to be confused with the U.S. team that won the  
World Cup last month. They just wanted to emulate them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had our own expectations, because we are a different  
team,'' Solo said. ``We are not the USA team, not the World Cup 
team. So we had to establish our own expectations and distinguish 
ourselves. And it wasn't just because they won. 
</P>
<P>
	``But they intrigued us and they inspired us.''

	``I think it was easier, because we knew we had gold and silver  
wrapped up, so that took the burden off,'' Goldstein said. 
``Anytime you play a friend, especially someone you play every day, 
literally, you have no tricks up your sleeve. Hopefully we were

tournament, especially the American team that was so strong.''

<P>
	The American women's basketball team wasn't strong enough for

<HEADLINE> Cat Thief Favored in Haskell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OCEANPORT, N.J. (AP) -- Despite drawing the outside post  
positions, Menifee and Cat Thief were made the top two morning line 
choices Friday for the $1 million Haskell Invitational at Monmouth 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
	A field of eight 3-year-olds was entered in Sunday's Grade I,  
1 1/8-mile race that lost some of its luster when Silverbulletday 
opted not to race against colts again. 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee has been assigned the high weight of 124 pounds in  
making his first start since the Belmont Stakes. Pat Day will again 
ride the Elliott Walden-trained colt, who has been made the 9-5 
favorite despite drawing the No. 7 post position. 
</P>
<P>
	Cat Thief, the 2-1 second choice with 123 pounds, got the  
outside post for trainer D. Wayne Lukas. 
</P>
<P>
	``This horse does have tactical speed,'' said Mike Smith, who  
will ride Cat Thief, the third-place finisher in the Kentucky 
Derby. ``It doesn't matter where he breaks from, he'll be up on the 
pace, if not in front. I think Monmouth has always been a speed 
favoring track, so hopefully that will work to my advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The top two choices will probably be tested by Forestry, the 4-1  
third choice who will carry 118 pounds, including jockey Jerry 
Bailey. The Bob Baffert-trained colt has won five straight starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he'll be better than he was in the Dwyer,'' Baffert  
said. ``He came out of the Dwyer in great shape. The day after, he 
was just an animal. He didn't go through the Triple Crown, so he is 
a fresh horse and that may be the advantage we need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee ran in all three Triple Crown races and then took two  
months off. Walden also entered Ecton Park in the Haskell, but he 
may opt to send the colt to Saratoga to run in the Jim Dandy. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodcarver, a 15-1 longshot assigned 117 pounds with Mickey  
Walls, drew the rail post position. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the field in post position order with colt, jockey,  
weight and odds: 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Directive, Joe Bravo, 116, 12-1; Ghost Story, Robbie  
Davis, 113, 15-1; Forestry, Jerry Bailey, 118, 4-1; Unbridled Jet, 
Herbert Castillo Jr., 113, 12-1; Ecton Park, Alex Solis, 8-1; 
Menifee, Pat Day, 124, 9-5; Cat Thief, Mike Smith, 123, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Post time is scheduled for 5:42 p.m. EDT.

<HEADLINE> Volvo Buys Majority Stake in Scania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- A $7.4 billion deal with Investor AB  
will give Volvo AB a majority stake in rival Swedish vehicle maker 
Scania, creating the world's second-largest manufacturer of trucks 
and buses. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo said Friday it will buy the 49 percent stake in Scania  
that had been owned by Investor, the investment arm of Sweden's 
powerful Wallenberg business family. The acquisition gives Volvo 
69.6 percent of the votes in Scania. 
</P>
<P>
	Scania will remain a separate division within Volvo, retaining  
its trademarks and distribution operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrangement makes Volvo and Scania ``competitive partners,''  
according to Volvo president and chief executive Leif Johansson, 
but some analysts worried that the market wouldn't understand the 
concept. 
</P>
<P>
	Haakan Persson of Stockholm's Aragon investment house said  
companies that previously had sought bids from both Scania and 
Volvo might now perceive the two companies as essentially the same 
and take only one bid. 
</P>
<P>
	But others foresee little difficulty.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think the demand for heavy trucks, the type they produce,  
will be growing,'' said Ron Pinelli of Autodata Corp. in Woodcliff 
Lake, N.J. ``Moving forward, I think Volvo is in an excellent 
position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo began its push to acquire Scania in January, several weeks  
before announcing the sale of its passenger-car division to Ford 
Motors. In a move that shocked Swedish business circles, Volvo 
bought 13 percent of the shares in Scania and began negotiations 
with Investor. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Scania chief executive Leif Oestling said he  
regarded Volvo's move as ``close to hostile,'' but Friday he 
characterized Volvo's acquisition with a combination of resignation 
and optimism. 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation is what it is,'' he said at a news conference.  
``The tide is turning on this question and we are looking forward. 
... Presumably the affair is good both for the two companies and 
for Sweden.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The alternative would have been a foreign buyer and the  
rationalization that would have then taken place would have hit 
Sweden,'' said Volvo board chairman Lars Ramqvist. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the sale of its car division to Ford put $5.8 billion in  
its coffers, cash-rich Volvo had been seen by many analysts as a 
likely takeover target. Newspaper reports this summer said 
Volkswagen had been discussing a takeover with Volvo. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo has about 52,500 employees worldwide and Scania 23,500.  
Johansson declined to speculate on how many jobs might be 
eliminated in the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger, which must be approved by the European Union, would  
create the world's second-largest truck- and bus-maker, behind 
DaimlerChrysler AG. In 1998, Scania's sales were $5.6 billion and 
Volvo's nonpassenger car sales were $10.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies reported sales increases of around 12 percent for  
the first half of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement drove Scania's shares sharply higher, closing  
on Stockholm's bourse at $37, a 25 percent increase. Volvo's shares 
declined 8.6 percent to $27.40, apparently reflecting concerns that 
Volvo would lose market share or that it may have overpaid for 
Scania.

<HEADLINE> Lycos Buys Sonique Player Maker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WALTHAM, Mass. (AP) -- Lycos Inc. announced today it has acquired  
Internet Music Distribution Inc., maker of the Sonique player that 
enables downloaded music to be played on a PC. 
</P>
<P>
	Players such as Sonique are in high demand, as more people look  
to the Internet to download music from various Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Lycos, based in Waltham, Mass., bought the California-based  
IMDI, formerly known as MediaScience, for about 1.1 million shares 
of stock in a deal valued at about $39 million, based on Lycos' 
closing stock price Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lycos has aggressively positioned itself to become a leader in  
the burgeoning online music market. In February, it launched MP3 
Search, a search engine that allows consumers to look for music 
titles available in the popular MP3 audio format. 
</P>
<P>
	The free Sonique music player can play MP3 files, Microsoft  
Windows Media files and audio CDs, among other formats. 
</P>
<P>
	Lycos operates Lycos.com, the fourth most popular portal site,  
according to Media Metrix, and a number of other sites including 
Hotbot.com, Tripod.com and Wired.com.

<HEADLINE> Lycos To Buy PC Music Player Maker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- In a move that could help position the company as  
a source for online music, Lycos Inc. has reached a deal to acquire 
a firm that makes a PC audio player. 
</P>
<P>
	Lycos' acquisition of Internet Music Distribution Inc. follows  
its launch in February of a search engine that hunts the Internet 
specifically for music files posted online in a format known as 
MP3. 
</P>
<P>
	IMDI has offices in San Francisco and Campbell Calif., as well  
as Bozeman, Mont. It makes Sonique, an MP3 player that can be 
downloaded from the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're definitely interested in being a music destination for  
people on the web,'' said Kirsten Rankin, a Lycos spokeswoman. 
``Music is a very popular content for people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So popular, in fact, that searches for music-related terms like  
``MP3'' recently surpassed sexual terms as the most popular queries 
in Lycos' search engines, Rankin said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to terms of the deal announced Friday, Lycos will  
acquire IMDI for about 1.1 million shares of Lycos stock worth 
about $37 million, based on Lycos' closing stock price Friday of 
$34.06 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	While Lycos won't directly profit from Sonique -- it's given away  
for free -- it will help Lycos offer something that other Internet 
portals don't. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helps them because Lycos is about building traffic, and  
funding themselves based on advertising,'' said Lise Buyer, an 
analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston. ``What they need to do is 
establish themselves in some proprietary niches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Along with MP3 files, the Sonique music player can play  
Microsoft Windows Media files and audio CDs, among other formats.

<HEADLINE> Ventura Wants Legislative Staff Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL (AP) -- Gov. Jesse Ventura pushed Friday for the  
elimination of 134 legislative jobs, saying they are partisan 
staffers who waste taxpayer dollars supporting party power 
struggles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Millions of dollars every year is being paid of our tax  
dollars to support Republican positions and Democrat positions 
where their only job is politics. Their only job is spinning and 
supporting of the power struggle between the two parties,'' Ventura 
said on his weekly radio show. 
</P>
<P>
	The four legislative caucuses have research staff assigned to  
them. Most concede that politics and policy are inseparable at the 
Legislature, but leaders believe the majority of their staffs focus 
on policy. The leaders defended the staff as necessary to respond 
to constituents and conduct research on many complicated issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Roger Moe, a Democrat, called the radio comments  
``Vintage Governor Ventura'' and added, ``Once again he doesn't 
know what he's talking about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Leader Tim Pawlenty, a Republcian, responded  
similarly, saying, ``I know the governor is new at this and so we 
have to cut him some slack, but on this one, he's simply wrong.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Leaders Back Right To Sue HMOs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House GOP leaders have agreed for the first  
time to back new patient rights to sue HMOs as they try to hold 
their fractured party together on health care. 
</P>
<P>
	The move comes a day after 20 Republicans signed on with  
Democratic leaders to support a bill that is much broader than GOP 
leaders would like. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., promised a floor vote in  
September on legislation being developed by Reps. Tom Coburn, 
R-Okla., and John Shadegg, R-Ariz. It will also include the right 
to take disputes to an independent panel, the right to choose 
doctors outside a network and easier access to gynecologists, 
obstetricians and pediatricians. 
</P>
<P>
	Most significantly, it will include new rights to sue -- the  
first time that GOP leaders have backed such a provision. ``HMOs 
can be taken to court and held accountable when patients are 
harmed,'' Hastert said in a statement describing the provision. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders, including Hastert, met with Coburn and Shadegg well  
past midnight after Democrats announced Thursday their alliance 
with Rep. Charles Norwood, R-Ga., and other Republicans. Norwood, a 
former dentist, has been working for more than a year to get 
Republicans to back a broader HMO bill, but gave up and joined with 
Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., and other Democratic leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	If most Democrats unite behind the bill, it would have enough  
support to pass. 
</P>
<P>
	The new alliance catapulted GOP leaders into action, said  
Coburn, a doctor who had been working with Norwood on the issue but 
decided to stay with the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	``The leadership recognized that the members of Congress  
understand -- maybe better than they do -- how big a problem this 
is,'' he said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Charlie Norwood was very helpful in moving the ball down the  
court,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders didn't act earlier, Coburn said, because ``they were  
trying not to hurt their friends'' in the business and insurance 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, business and insurance groups were mobilizing Friday to  
get employers across the country to lobby their members of Congress 
over the August recess, which begins this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Association of Health Plans, an HMO trade group,  
was planning television advertising targeting 60 congressional 
districts across the country. And the National Association of 
Manufacturers was encouraging its members to write to their 
employees, warning that their health insurance could cost more -- or 
disappear altogether -- if these bills pass. 
</P>
<P>
	One company, 3M, already sent this sort of letter to its  
workers, said Neil Trautwein, a lobbyist for the association, and 
got a ``tremendous response.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That gives us heart in the middle of a rather busy and dark  
week,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And the opponents have adopted a new moniker for the HMO bill  
backed by Dingell and Norwood, derisively calling it the 
``Ding-wood'' bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the new GOP leadership bill were not yet worked out,  
but Coburn said the right to sue provisions would be limited. 
Patients would have to demonstrate that they were injured to an 
``injury certification panel'' before they could sue in court. If a 
health plan had ``followed the rules and done nothing egregious,'' 
it would not be subject to punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The bipartisan Dingell-Norwood bill also limits suits. Companies  
obeying an independent panel's ruling still could be sued in state 
courts, but would not be liable for punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP bill also includes a variety of provisions meant to help  
people without insurance get coverage. That includes medical 
savings accounts, an approach Democrats generally dislike, and new 
ways for small businesses to pool their employees to buy insurance. 
It also will include new tax deductions to help people buy 
insurance on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, GOP leaders, working with a narrow majority, have  
been unable to fashion a bill they believe could win enough support 
on the floor. It was not clear whether this new package could do 
that. They hope to win over some conservative Democrats, and they 
hope that the new rights to sue will not lose them the votes of 
conservative Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	John Feehrey, Hastert's spokesman, acknowledged that it will not  
be easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The politics of this has always been extremely complicated,''  
he said, ``and will continue to be extremely complicated.''

<HEADLINE> Dolphins' Martin Gets Back On Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Tony Martin had somebody say something nice  
about him for a change Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Miami Dolphins receiver, who spent much of the week  
listening to the prosecution's case in his federal drug trial, was 
excused from court and caught a long touchdown pass in a workout 
against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tony Martin looked like he was in midseason form,'' Bucs coach  
Tony Dungy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins agreed, but they're wondering whether their new  
receiver will even be playing at midseason. Martin's trial on 
charges of laundering drug money resumes Monday, and his conviction 
would likely mean a prison sentence of at least three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm at peace,'' he said. ``When I'm here, I feel real good  
about myself. Coming on the field is definitely my escape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bucs and Dolphins welcomed the chance to practice against  
another team early in training camp. Their opening preseason games 
are next weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really good to work against someone who has a different  
style and techniques than you do,'' Dungy said. ``It's great work 
for both sides.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teams will scrimmage Saturday at the Orange Bowl. Dungy and  
counterpart Jimmy Johnson plan to closely watch rookies, other 
newcomers and reserves battling for roster spots. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big thing for us will be to see how they function in a  
setting that's a little different than practice,'' Dungy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Each workout Friday attracted about 2,000 fans, and Martin drew  
one of the biggest ovations on the first play of a passing drill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came out kind of flat,'' Martin said. ``I said, all right,  
I'll get everybody going. I'll run a deep pattern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin sprinted past cornerback Donnie Abraham, caught Dan  
Marino's long pass in stride and glided into the end zone. The play 
gave the Dolphins a taste of what their offense has lacked in 
recent years -- a deep threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why I'm here,'' Martin said. ``You got a sample of it  
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin praised Abraham but also said the Tampa Bay secondary  
didn't compare to Miami's. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you go against Sam Madison and Terrell Buckley every day  
and then go against different guys, it seems so much easier,'' 
Martin said. ``Today was like a breeze.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jimmy Johnson badly needs Martin's speed to loosen  
defenses to bunched at the line of scrimmage last year and stuffed 
the Dolphins' running game. That's why Miami signed the two-time 
Super Bowl receiver to a four-year, $14.2 million contract in 
April, just weeks after he was indicted and then released by the 
Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	But don't suggest to Johnson that the Dolphins must have Martin  
this season to make a Super Bowl bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want as many good players as we can get,'' Johnson said.  
``But there's not a player on this team we must have.''

<HEADLINE> Eight Companies Postpone IPOs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The IPO market may be grinding to a halt, if  
events over the past week are any indication. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight of 11 companies poised to launch their initial public  
offerings Friday postponed their debut as jitters replaced the 
infectious enthusiasm that has surrounded Internet companies over 
the past several months. 
</P>
<P>
	The three companies that did go public experienced a lackluster  
reception, all finishing around their opening price. Their 
performance was in stark contrast to companies such as eToys, which 
surged more than 300 percent in its first day of trading in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Those that withdrew, including Women.com Networks of San Mateo,  
Calif., and floral delivery service FTD.com, were scared off by the 
volatility of recent responses to Internet-related IPOs, analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those companies planning to go public today are kind of  
traumatized by what's happened this week,'' said Jay Ritter, a 
University of Florida finance professor who specializes in IPOs. 
``The IPO market, whether we're dealing with the Internet or any 
industry, has always been sensitive to market movements, and 
Internet stocks are sensitive to extremes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Enthusiasm for Internet IPOs appeared to revive on Thursday when  
Internet Capital Group, a Wayne, Pa., holding company with 
investments in 35 Internet businesses, more than doubled its 
offering price on the first day of trading. Two other Web-related 
IPOs also performed well, but two more got the cold shoulder from 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	That followed a disastrous run on Tuesday and Wednesday in which  
seven companies going public fell below their offering prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The seesaw reaction makes it impossible to tell if the IPO boom  
is dead or in a cycle of fluctuations, said Ivo Welch, a University 
of California, Los Angeles, finance professor who tracks the IPO 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very difficult to predict where the Internet stocks are  
going to be three months for now. If they come back we'll see a lot 
of Internet IPOs,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IPO retreat comes on the heels of a long slide in Internet  
stocks. The 40-stock Dow Jones Internet Index has shed half of its 
value since it hit an all-time high on April 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans for Friday IPOs also were unsettled by fears that new  
economic data released before the start of trading would push 
markets down again, said Corey Ostman of Ostman's Alert IPO, a 
Santa Monica, Calif., company that has tracked the IPO market since 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong government employment report Friday, including signs  
that wage pressure was intensifying, did raise worries that the 
Federal Reserve would seek to launch another strike against 
inflation by pushing up interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial 
average fell 79.79 points, erasing more than half of its Thursday 
gain of 119.05. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies that postponed indicated they would try again next  
week, Ostman said.

<HEADLINE> Solids Are New Look in Neckwear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- You can't judge a man by his tie anymore.  
</P>
<P>
	Busy ties were long the rage -- loud flowers, cartoons, maps of  
the world, and abstract art -- and many men relayed their 
personalities to the world through their neckwear. 
</P>
<P>
	But not these days. The trendy look is the plain, one-color tie.  
Stores around the country say sales are brisk of monochrome ties, 
which come in conservative blues and blacks as well as bright -- and 
clearly non-traditional -- colors such as hot pink, shimmery red and 
royal blue. 
</P>
<P>
	``It used to be you would make a fashion statement by how busy  
your tie was, but not anymore,'' said David Wolfe, creative 
director at Doneger Design Direction, a fashion forecaster and 
consulting firm. ``Now, it's the plainer, the better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Solid ties hit the fashion runways a few years ago, but they've  
really plowed into the mainstream market in the last year. Now 
everyone from designers such as Calvin Klein and Giorgio Armani to 
Banana Republic are showing them. 
</P>
<P>
	The solid tie is even finding its way onto TV. Bobby Donnell,  
the main character on the popular ABC television series ``The 
Practice,'' regularly sports the dark-tie, dark-shirt look. 
</P>
<P>
	Retailers aren't complaining -- the new look in neckwear is  
helping boost tie sales, which have been weak in recent years. For 
instance, last year 100 million ties sold in the United States, 
down from 110 million in 1994, according to the Port Washington, 
N.Y.-based market research firm The NPD Group. 
</P>
<P>
	While some say the monochrome tie is a look better suited for  
mobsters in the movies, consumers don't seem to mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Jon Schmidt bought three solid ties in the last few months,  
which is more than he's bought in the last three years. One recent 
evening, he wore a bold blue tie with a matching shirt and a black 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I no longer go through the morning stress of whether the tie  
matches or not,'' said Schmidt, a 30-year-old New Yorker who works 
at a Wall Street investment firm. ``I like the simplicity of the 
solid-tie thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the men's retail chain Today's Man, solid ties represent  
about 20 percent of the total tie business, up from 12 percent a 
year ago. The ties, which come in silk or satin fabrics, sell for 
$15 and $25. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's Man has displays showing solid ties with coordinating  
shirts -- which has helped convince consumers the look can work. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been a real shift in the outfit that men wear,''  
said Larry Schechterman, vice president and merchandise manager for 
men's furnishings and sportswear for Moorestown, N.J.-based Today's 
Man. ``It is less about pattern and more about texture and color, 
solid color.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saks Fifth Avenue also has made the solid tie a major part of  
its neckwear department, selling four to five times more than they 
did just a few years ago. It now sells everything from Saks-branded 
ties for $70 to high-end Brioni ties for $125, and this fall it 
will expand the collection to include solid ties in wool and 
cashmere. 
</P>
<P>
	But the solid tie isn't for everyone.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think the big disadvantage to the solid tie is the food  
issue,'' said Wolfe. ``If you get food on it, it doesn't just blend 
in with the pattern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Yorker Dan Sullivan doesn't think the one-color tie is the  
look for him since he's into off-beat, goofy ties, pointing to the 
``South Park'' tie he was wearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wearing a suit is so boring. The only excitement in my work  
wardrobe is my tie,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Border Mayor Complains of Immigrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOUGLAS, Ariz. (AP) -- Fed up with the trash and tension as  
thousands of Mexican immigrants sneak across the border here each 
month, the mayor of this small town is lashing out -- not at the 
Mexicans but at the Americans who hire them. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Ray Borane has written biting letters to newspapers in  
major cities nationwide in the past month, among them The 
Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, Las Vegas Sun and The Arizona 
Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are ultimately to blame,'' Borane wrote.  
</P>
<P>
	``When you hire illegal immigrants because you have forgotten,  
or never knew how to make your own beds, mow your own lawns or cook 
your own meals, as we do ours daily, it causes our fields to be 
littered with thousands of plastic jugs and pieces of clothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The immigrants who trek miles across the barren Arizona  
landscape leave empty water jugs, plastic wrappers and trash, cut 
ranchers' barbed wire fences to slip through and sometimes die on 
the vast expanses from the heat and a lack of food. 
</P>
<P>
	Border Patrol agents at the Douglas station stopped 16,900  
illegal entrants last month, outnumbering the community of 16,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor, serving his third year, has complained to the U.S.  
Justice Department, but was told that officials were reviewing the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, he wrote to President Clinton, accusing him of  
failing to address the problem of uncontrolled illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
	``I write to tell you the border is bleeding,'' Borane told the  
president. ``I simply cannot comprehend your inability to even 
publicly recognize or acknowledge this invasion -- intrusion into 
our lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of our isolation, we feel disgusted, frustrated and  
abandoned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Borane wants the Immigration and Naturalization Service to start  
a guest worker program giving Mexicans permission to come into the 
United States temporarily to work in certain industries. The 
workers could go through regular ports of entry rather than 
sneaking across private land, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also suggested the federal government deputize local law  
enforcement officers so they could enforce federal immigration 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
	In the two years since Douglas became the focal point for  
illegal crossings, the federal government has stepped up border 
enforcement. About 350 agents are in the Douglas area, and this 
spring the Border Patrol organized ranch patrols in response to 
complaints from rural residents. 
</P>
<P>
	But Borane says enforcement alone will never stop the flow. The  
disparity between the poverty in Mexico and the ``insatiable 
demand'' for cheap Mexican labor in the United States is too great, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Henzo, an artist who has lived in Douglas for 10 years,  
agrees that the trespassers can be a nuisance, but he says it 
primarily bothers ranchers and farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't see a great horde invading the community, raping and  
pillaging,'' Henzo said. ``They do leave behind trash, plastic 
bottles and bags.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Across the border from Douglas in Agua Prieta, Mexico, Ramiro  
Reyes, a married father of two, said he has crossed illegally 
several times to work in California fields picking grapes and 
melons. 
</P>
<P>
	``The employers have jobs, but they don't have people to fill  
them, so they have to hire Mexicans,'' he said. ``If it wasn't for 
the Mexicans, who would do this work?''

<HEADLINE> N.H. Co. Recalls Ground Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- About a quarter-million pounds of ground beef  
and frozen patties are being recalled nationwide and in Puerto Rico 
after a shipment was linked to contamination by e. coli bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	The meat was produced April 2 by Jac Pac Foods of Manchester,  
N.H., which recalled the meat voluntarily. A boy in Monroe County, 
N.Y., became ill after eating a hamburger made with the meat, state 
officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The meat was sold through BJ's Wholesale Club stores.  
</P>
<P>
	E. coli O157 can cause serious illness and sometimes death,  
especially in children and the elderly. Symptoms include chills and 
bloody diarrhea. 
</P>
<P>
	The recalled products are packaged in 5-pound and 10-pound boxes  
bearing ``EST 785'' within the Agriculture Department's seal of 
inspection. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of the potential hazard of foodborne illness from  
consumption of undercooked or underprocessed meat products 
contaminated with potentially harmful pathogens, we urge consumers 
who have purchased the suspect product not to eat it and to return 
it to the place of purchase,'' said Thomas Billy, administrator of 
USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service.

<HEADLINE> Bears QB McNown Compared to Many </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Cade McNown hasn't even played in his first NFL  
game, and already the comparisons are starting. 
</P>
<P>
	With his endless exuberance and ability to make things happen on  
the fly, some teammates liken him to Brett Favre. With his knack 
for rallying UCLA from seemingly certain defeats, he showed a 
little of John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	While there's something to both of those, the best comparison  
right now might be to Peyton Manning. Although Manning was the No. 
1 pick and McNown the 12th, both were drafted to play right away, 
not spend a year or two learning behind someone else. Both have 
maturity and mental abilities well beyond their 20-something years. 
</P>
<P>
	And on Saturday, McNown will play in the exhibition opener  
despite his late arrival to training camp, just like Manning did. 
The Chicago Bears' opponent? Manning and the Indianapolis Colts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the only way to learn is by experience. That happened  
to me last year,'' Manning said. ``Everyone has his own opinion, 
but the sooner you play, the better off you will be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears seem to agree.  
</P>
<P>
	McNown got to training camp Monday night after an 11-day  
holdout, and coach Dick Jauron initially said the rookie would sit 
out this week's game. But after watching McNown run the Bears' 
complicated new offense like he's been doing it for weeks and get 
better and better at picking up blitzes in practice, Jauron, 
offensive coordinator Gary Crowton and quarterbacks coach John 
Shoop decided the rookie was ready. 
</P>
<P>
	McNown will start the second half and play a few series, Jauron  
said Friday. Shane Matthews will play the first half, and Jim 
Miller will relieve McNown. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just had to keep talking through the week and make sure we  
felt he was ready with the offense,'' Jauron said. ``Both Gary and 
John felt that he is. We figure it's best for everybody to get him 
on the field. Get him baptized and go about our business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manning got a similar introduction to the NFL. Although he  
missed the first five days of training camp, Manning -- like McNown 
-- had spent about a month with the Colts during the spring and 
summer and already knew the basics of their offense. 
</P>
<P>
	He struggled early, throwing 14 interceptions in his first six  
games as the Colts went 1-5. But he settled down and finished the 
season impressively, setting NFL rookie records for completions 
(326), attempts (575), yards passing (3,739), touchdowns (26) and 
consecutive games with a TD pass (13). His four three-TD games and 
four games with 300-plus yards passing also were NFL rookie 
records. 
</P>
<P>
	His completions were second-best in the NFL, and he was third in  
yardage. He also took every snap for the Colts, a team first. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter how high a draft pick you are, there is still that  
doubt about the transition from the college game to the NFL, mainly 
in adjusting to the speed and knowing what to expect,'' Manning 
said. ``Last year, I saw it. I know how fast and complex the 
defenses are. I'll learn a lot more this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manning didn't play in the Colts' scrimmage against the St.  
Louis Rams last weekend, but he'll start Saturday and play the 
first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still a young player, but I feel much more comfortable  
this year,'' he said. ``I learned a lot last year. I was able to 
take every snap and see a lot of things. I've tried to use that to 
my advantage this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trend has been for rookie quarterbacks to struggle, and  
McNown is well aware of that. He knows all about Manning's season 
last year. He knows what Elway did as a rookie, and how Ryan Leaf, 
Rick Mirer and all the other rookies who played right away fared. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's them, McNown said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Not to say that because some other guys had a rough start I'm  
not going to have a rough start,'' he said. ``I'm just saying my 
situation is very unique, just like each one of those was unique. I 
know they all seemed to have gone through some tough times early 
on, but it still doesn't mean that ... has to happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been one to compare myself to anybody else,'' he  
said. ``You don't want to get into comparing yourself to others 
because if you can't measure up, then you feel like a failure. And, 
if you do measure up, who's to say you can't exceed that?''

<HEADLINE> Remembering Nixon's Final Hours </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Richard Nixon gave his resignation speech Thursday, Aug. 8,  
1974, telling the nation, ``I regret deeply any injuries that may 
have been done.'' The next day, he spoke to White House staff 
assembled in the East Room, then flew to California, his 
resignation taking effect while he was airborne. 
</P>
<P>
	Reflections on the final hours:  
</P>
<P>
	Leon Jaworski, the late Watergate special prosecutor: ``It would  
have been a good resignation speech for a president leaving office 
because of illness, or for one who had lost congressional support 
because of differences over policies. It was not the speech of a 
president who had violated his constitutional oath and duty by 
obstructing justice, by abusing the power of his office, by 
transforming the Oval Office into a mean den where perjury and low 
scheming became a way of life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nixon, recalling his remarks in the East Room: ``Last night had  
been the formal speech for history, but now I had a chance to talk 
personally and intimately to these people who had worked so hard 
for me and whom I had let down so badly. This was the nightmarish 
end of a long dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Dean, counsel to Nixon who served four months for  
conspiracy to obstruct justice: ``Through most of the speech I felt 
pangs of sympathy for him, which I fought to suppress because I 
thought they were vestiges of my old loyalty. By the time he had 
finished, my pity had given way to dismay. He never admitted a damn 
thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander Haig, Nixon's chief of staff: ``Until he left office,  
that man was in control. He was distraught. He was in a personal 
crisis of unprecedented magnitude -- all he ever wanted was to be 
president. But of all the presidents I have known, he was the most 
thoughtful. ... No matter how difficult it was in those last days, 
I'd go in, and he'd ask how my family was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Lacovara, then deputy solicitor general: ``There were  
concerns that the president might do something dangerous in the 
last days. ... We were assured by back channels in the White House 
that if -- as somebody put it -- the president picks up a red phone, 
nobody will answer it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Jones, then director of White House personnel: ``In the  
East Room, I was quite angry with him. I felt he had let us down 
horribly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	George McGovern, 1972 Democratic presidential candidate and a  
victim of the Nixon campaign's dirty tricks: ``I didn't think the 
resignation would come that fast. I am sure in Nixon's mind he saw 
resignation as the least painful and degrading way to handle a 
rather unhappy situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Sirica, the judge who presided over Watergate criminal  
trials: ``I felt sorry for him, but I was also relieved to see him 
go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Julie Nixon Eisenhower, Nixon's daughter: ``I saw it written  
later that it was 'odd' my father mentioned his parents but not his 
wife in those farewell remarks (in the East Room). But that would 
have been asking too much of any man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald Ford, the vice president who succeeded Nixon: ``He sat  
behind his desk in the Oval Office; I sat on a chair on his left 
side. He was very calm -- very straightforward. He told me that he 
planned to resign the next day at 11 o'clock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hermann Eilts, Nixon's ambassador to Egypt: ``I got (Egyptian  
President Anwar) Sadat out of bed early in the morning. It was a 
shock to him. He made a comment about Watergate's being 
insignificant; he was convinced that the resignation must be due to 
Nixon's health -- his phlebitis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Woodward, Washington Post reporter who, with Carl Bernstein,  
broke many Watergate stories: ``I remember Carl and I didn't have a 
story to write. We were in the newsroom watching the speech and 
they brought up bologna sandwiches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Saxbe, Nixon's last attorney general: ``When he made his  
dramatic, family-surrounded, tearful speech and then walked to the 
chopper, I thought it was high drama -- like somebody had 
choreographed it. I felt that, under the circumstances, he was a 
little overly dramatic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Hartmann, chief of staff to Vice President Ford: ``After  
the Nixons got on the helicopter, I went to Bill Timmons' (Nixon's 
congressional lobbyist) office. He had a bottle of scotch on his 
desk and a drink in his hand. He poured me a tumbler full and said, 
'To the president,' meaning Ford. I said, 'To the president,' 
meaning Nixon.

<HEADLINE> Wine Industry Mad Over Subsidy Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Winemakers say they'll fight a move by the  
Senate to cut off subsidies for exports of alcoholic beverages. 
</P>
<P>
	The wine industry received $3.6 million in subsidies this year  
through the Agriculture Department's Market Access Program, which 
helps cooperatives and trade organizations sell their products 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Senate approved an amendment to a USDA spending bill  
this week that would prevent the industry from getting any more 
money in fiscal 2000. The House doesn't have that prohibition, 
which applies to all alcoholic beverages, in its version of the 
bill, so a House-Senate conference committee will have to settle 
the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban was inserted by Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., who  
``doesn't think the government should be in the business of 
actually promoting alcoholic beverages,'' spokesman John DeCrosta 
said Friday. The wine industry can afford to pay its own marketing 
costs, DeCrosta said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thurmond, who lost a daughter to a drunken driving accident, has  
proposed to triple the excise taxes on wine and held up three 
Clinton administration appointments until it agreed to review a 
policy allowing wine bottles to carry labels touting its health 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Thurmond's ``political vendetta against the U.S. wine industry  
continues to know no bounds,'' said John De Luca, president of the 
San Francisco-based Wine Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	The subsidies primarily help small family-owned vintners, he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wine Institute received $3.2 million this year. An  
additional $322,730 went to the Northwest Wine Promotion Coalition, 
while the New York Wine and Grape Foundation got $90,748. 
</P>
<P>
	The wine industry also wants to stop a House-passed bill aimed  
at cracking down on illegal sales of alcoholic beverages to minors 
over the Internet. The bill would let state attorneys general go 
into federal court to stop illegal shipments of ``intoxicating 
liquors'' to residents.

<HEADLINE> Richess Hanover Wins Big M Pace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Richess Hanover took the lead just  
before the three-quarter pole and held off a late rush by 
stablemate Dream Work to win the $600,000 Woodrow Wilson Pace for 
2-year-olds at the Meadowlands Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was the sixth in as many starts for Richess Hanover,  
who was driven by Mike Lachance, trained by Robert McIntosh and 
owned by Bob Waxman. Richess Hanover, a son of Western Hanover, 
started from the No. 1 post position and broke out to the early 
lead. He backed off as Thunder Bay and then Bunch led the pack 
through blazing fractions of 26 3-5 for a quarter mile and 54 2-5 
for a half. Lachance saved ground in third before swinging his colt 
to the inside, overtaking Thunder Bay and then Bunch just before 
the three-quarter pole. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the rail I felt pretty confident,'' Lachance said. ``This  
colt can do anything you want. I didn't expect those kind of 
fractions but he was nice and relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I pulled on the last turn I knew I had a lot of horse,''  
Lachance said. ``I had to use him hard down the stretch but he has 
a great attitude and a great gait.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After passing the three-quarter pole in 1:24 3-5, Richess  
Hanover opened a three-length lead. But he had to dig hard to 
prevail by a half-length over the McIntosh-trained Dream Work, 
driven by Daniel Dube. The winner was timed in a career-best 1:53. 
</P>
<P>
	The entry of Richess Hanover and Dream Works paid $3, $3.40 and  
$2.20. Happy Joe Lucky finished third and paid $4. 
</P>
<P>
	``Richess Hanover has been good from day one,'' McIntosh sai.  
``I'd seen Western Hanover as a yearling and he reminded me of him. 
Mike gave him a super steer, a beautiful drive. I just hoped he 
wouldn't get trapped in. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dream Work is a big colt who's improving,'' McIntosh said.  
``He's a big grinding horse who gets better each week.''

<HEADLINE> Hacker Vandalizes Security Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the high-tech equivalent of a thief  
burglarizing police headquarters, a hacker vandalized a prominent 
Internet site devoted to computer security using an unusually 
clever tactic. 
</P>
<P>
	The embarrassing electronic assault against the AntiOnline site  
Thursday occurred days after other hackers altered the Web site for 
Symantec Corp., whose software is used by millions of consumers to 
protect against viruses and electronic snoops. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest incident, a hacker using an Internet account in  
Russia successfully tricked the site's computer to load hidden 
software code from elsewhere onto one of its own Web pages, called 
``Eye on the Underground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The site was fixed just over an hour later, but this week's  
attacks raised questions about Internet security: If organizations 
that clearly are aware of potential security problems can't protect 
their sites, how can the rest of the Internet? 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no absolute security,'' said James Adams, chief  
executive officer of Infrastructure Defense Inc., which works to 
protect companies against hackers. ``All you can do is try to keep 
ahead of the game. For anybody to claim they're totally secure, 
it's not true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the hacker never directly infiltrated AntiOnline's own  
computers, the hidden code redirected visitors to a Web page with 
the image of an unblinking eye along with the message ``expensive 
security systems do not protect from stupidity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't call it sophisticated, but I'd call it clever,''  
acknowledged John ``JP'' Vranesevich, who runs AntiOnline in 
Beaver, Pa., a popular site specializing in news about hackers and 
security. 
</P>
<P>
	The affected AntiOnline page was designed to automatically  
collect and display messages posted to an online discussion group 
at another Internet site popular among hackers. 
</P>
<P>
	But someone using the Internet account traced to Russia slipped  
hidden computer code into the text of one of those messages, which 
was then automatically loaded onto AntiOnline's site and sabotaged 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams said Web sites specializing in computer security need to  
take greater precautions because successful attacks against these 
computers can carry greater glory among the underground hacking 
community. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are brownie points to be gained,'' Adams said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Do we need better education? Yes,'' agreed Russ Cooper of  
NTBugtraq, a popular Internet discussion group about computer 
security. ``Do we need better tools? Yes. Does that mean I'm never 
going to suffer an attack? No. 
</P>
<P>
	``There isn't a piece of software you double-click to set up and  
it's secure,'' Cooper said. ``You have to have staff and policy, 
and you have to have monitoring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vranesevich, who was demonized by some hackers when he announced  
over the summer that AntiOnline would help authorities trace and 
prosecute computer attacks, noted that other Web site operators 
weren't as vulnerable to the same technique that affected his site. 
</P>
<P>
	``We sort of caused it ourselves,'' he said. ``We visit the  
hacker sites dynamically, and that is the type of scenario your 
average system administrator probably wouldn't encounter. We're 
doing things far more obscure.''

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Rebels Criticize Kidnap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Rebel leaders distanced themselves  
today from the kidnapping of about 30 people, including U.N. 
military observers, saying they had ordered their allies from 
Sierra Leone's former military junta to free the hostages. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a team of British diplomats, military experts and  
police were traveling to the capital, Freetown, to help negotiate 
the release of the group, which also included aid workers, 
journalists and West African peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	The former junta soldiers abducted the hostages Wednesday  
outside of Freetown, and they released four of them -- including the 
only American in the group -- on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``They shouldn't have done it,'' Pallo Bangura, a top official  
with the rebel Revolutionary United Front, said by telephone today 
from Lome, the capital of nearby Togo. ``They've received 
instructions that they should release them immediately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Relations between rebel commanders and former junta soldiers  
remain murky. The groups theoretically are allied. But many former 
junta soldiers felt excluded when the rebels signed a peace accord 
with the government July 7 in Lome, formally ending eight years of 
civil war. 
</P>
<P>
	One freed hostage said the captors spoke of that betrayal to the  
hostages. 
</P>
<P>
	The British negotiating team was expected to arrive today in  
Freetown. 
</P>
<P>
	``We take this incident very seriously and are acting with the  
utmost urgency,'' British Foreign Office Minister Peter Hain said 
in a statement Thursday. ``Five British soldiers are amongst those 
detained and we want them, and others, safely returned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the other captives are Sierra Leonean, though a  
Canadian, a Russian, a Malaysian and one person from Kyrgyzstan are 
also being held, U.N. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of former junta soldiers seized the hostages during a  
meeting in the Okra Hills, near the capital, where they had agreed 
to hand over about 150 women and children captured during the civil 
war. 
</P>
<P>
	After freeing a few of their prisoners, they cocked their  
machine guns and turned them on the receiving group, saying they 
were in desperate need of supplies and demanding a meeting with 
U.N. officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Two people were released on the spot -- a local Catholic bishop  
and the only woman in the group -- but the rest were forced to march 
into the forest, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	The junta soldiers released two more captives Thursday night,  
sending them back to Freetown with demands for food, medicine and 
political influence. 
</P>
<P>
	The freed hostages -- local Reuters reporter Christo Johnson and  
an American member of the U.N. military observer team -- walked some 
six miles to a highway checkpoint, where they were picked up by 
regional intervention force soldiers. Officials did not identify 
the American. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, speaking by telephone after his release, said the  
hostages were being held in a thatch building in the village of 
Magbini, about 55 miles east of Freetown. He said the rebels 
promised to free the remainder of the hostages once their demands 
are met. 
</P>
<P>
	The freed hostages carried letters for the government of  
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, the U.N. observer mission and U.S. 
officials. While contents of the letters have not been released, 
Johnson said the soldiers feel betrayed by rebel leader Foday 
Sankoh, who signed the Lome peace deal. 
</P>
<P>
	They asked that Kabbah use his influence to get Sankoh's RUF  
rebels to free Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma. Koroma, the junta's 
former commander, is believed to be detained by the RUF. The 
soldiers asked that Koroma be flown to Freetown to broadcast a 
radio appeal asking them to lay down their arms. 
</P>
<P>
	Koroma lead a May 1997 coup, ousting Kabbah's government and  
then allying his junta with the RUF rebels. His junta, however, was 
itself ousted in early 1998 by ECOMOG, the West African 
intervention force that backs Kabbah. 
</P>
<P>
	The kidnapping could undermine the fragile calm created when the  
peace accord was signed July 7 in Lome. It could also threaten aid 
to tens of thousands of hungry people across Sierra Leone as aid 
groups postpone food deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
	Sierra Leone's civil war has devastated the country. Tens of  
thousands of people were killed and many more were raped or maimed 
by the rebels, who waged a macabre campaign of terror as they tried 
to unseat Kabbah.

<HEADLINE> Cocaine Charges for Commander's Wife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- While Army Col. James Hiett was fighting the war  
on drugs in Colombia, federal authorities say his wife was 
conspiring with the enemy. 
</P>
<P>
	Laurie Anne Hiett, 36, is accused of shipping cocaine from  
Bogota, Colombia, to New York as part of a small Colombian 
narcotics ring, and even marking her own return address on some of 
the shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hiett, who has denied the allegations, surrendered Thursday  
in New York on drug conspiracy charges. She was later released on 
$150,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, she faces up to 12 years in prison.  
</P>
<P>
	Her attorney declined to comment Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	The Army insists Hiett, the head of U.S. anti-drug operations in  
Colombia, was unaware of the alleged crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigation by the Army Criminal Investigation Division in  
Panama cleared him of any criminal activity, and the U.S. Southern 
Command in Miami said his request to be transferred is pending. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation of Mrs. Hiett started in May when U.S. Customs  
agents conducting a routine search in Miami intercepted a package 
containing 1.2 kilograms of cocaine worth an estimate $30,000, 
according to papers filed in federal court in Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say the package was marked with Mrs. Hiett's return  
address and was shipped from the U.S. Embassy in Bogota to a New 
York address. 
</P>
<P>
	When undercover officers went to that address, they found more  
cocaine and documents naming Jorge Ayala, a civilian driver for 
U.S. military commanders in Colombia. They also arrested Hernan 
Arcila, who told them he had received five or six packages from the 
same source, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Army officials in Bogota found that Mrs. Hiett had sent several  
packages in April and May to either Arcila's home or a post office 
box rented by his sister. They said paperwork signed by Mrs. Hiett 
listed the contents as books, candy, coffee and Colombian 
artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
	When Mrs. Hiett was confronted by investigators in June, she  
said she had shipped the packages for Ayala and didn't know what 
was in them. But the investigators said she became flustered in a 
second interview and ``stated, in substance, `I'm afraid they'll 
kill me.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hiett ``became extremely agitated and accused Army  
investigators of making up a story to get her in trouble,'' they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ayala told investigators that Mrs. Hiett used cocaine and had  
asked him to buy the drug in a section of Bogota known for drug 
sales. Other witnesses said they had seen her there before, the 
court papers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. earmarked $289 million for counterdrug activity in  
Colombia this year. Barry McCaffrey, the White House drug control 
chief, said recently that current efforts were falling short and 
the situation had reached emergency proportions.

<HEADLINE> SMU Uncovers Potential Violations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Southern Methodist, the only university ever  
punished with the death penalty for NCAA violations, announced late 
Friday it has uncovered potential recruiting irregularities in its 
football program and responded by suspending an assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic director Jim Copeland said the university uncovered the  
possible violations about 2 1/2 weeks ago and notified the NCAA. The 
school hired a Kansas City law firm and suspended assistant Steve 
Malin, with pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Copeland said he could not comment on the specifics of the  
violations because SMU and the law firm will investigate first, 
then turn over the findings to the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, they're just suspected violations and allegations.  
But there was enough there to merit some type of suspension,'' 
Copeland said. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement from SMU described the issue as ``narrow in scope''  
and with ``no evidence of booster involvement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Copeland said the irregularities, which occurred over a period  
of three to four years, were uncovered during a procedure involving 
graduating athletes. He said he couldn't identify the players 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	NCAA spokesman Wally Renfro said he had no information about the  
violations and could not comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyer Mike Glazier, a partner with the law firm Bond, Shoeneck  
and King, declined to comment specifically on the SMU 
investigation, but said his firm specializes in NCAA compliance and 
has handled several similar cases at other institutions across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is pretty much exclusively what I do,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 25, 1987, the NCAA issued its first and only death  
penalty after finding that a banned booster paid 13 players 
thousands of dollars. The once-proud program that produced Doak 
Walker, Don Meredith and Eric Dickerson was banned from 1987 and 
chose to skip 1988. Football was resurrected in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Copeland said the new irregularities did not detract from the  
program. ``This doesn't take away from the fact that we've run a 
clean ship. We're going to keep responding,'' Copeland said. 
</P>
<P>
	Malin, 30, starred at North Mesquite High School. At East Texas  
State, now Texas A&AMP;M-Commerce, he played linebacker, tight end and 
offensive tackle and was named All-Lone Star Conference. He also 
earned an undergraduate degree in kinesiology and a master's degree 
in education there. He later got a master's in liberal arts from 
SMU. 
</P>
<P>
	He began his coaching career as an assistant at East Texas State  
in 1993 before moving to a graduate assistant position at SMU in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	A defensive line coach, Malin is the longest-tenured member of  
the SMU football coaching staff.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Still Biggest Arms Provider </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States retains its title as the  
world's largest supplier of weapons, raising its total to $7.1 
billion even though demand has been slumping worldwide, a 
congressional study found. 
</P>
<P>
	Developing nations such as Saudi Arabia and Malaysia remain the  
biggest buyers despite the constraints of the Asian financial 
crisis and lower oil prices, the Congressional Research Service 
said in its annual review of arms sales. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, the United States led in new arms deals, with $7.1  
billion -- up from $5.7 billion the year before. Despite the 
increase, that's considerably below the $21.5 billion in U.S. arms 
sales in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany ranked second, with $5.5 billion in new sales, and  
France third, with $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The value of all new arms sales worldwide was $23 billion, up  
slightly from $21.4 billion the year before, but down from the 
$37.4 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said that the trend has been downward, with sales to  
developing nations -- the biggest buyers of new arms -- at $13.2 
billion in 1998, down from $23 billion in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The Asian financial crisis and low oil prices have contributed  
to the decline in demand, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Competition for available arms sales continues to intensify  
among major weapons suppliers,'' wrote the report's author, Richard 
F. Grimmett, a national defense specialist with the research 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	``The limited resources of most developing nations to expend on  
weapons, and the need of many selling nations to secure cash for 
their weapons, continues to place constraints on significant 
expansion of the arms trade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the United States increased its sales to developing  
countries to $4.6 billion last year, up from $2.6 billion in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest buyer of arms last year was Saudi Arabia, with $2.7  
billion in new sales. The United Arab Emirates ranked second at 
$2.5 billion. Malaysia ranked third, with $2.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	They were followed by Egypt, $1.2 billion; Algeria, Israel and  
Kuwait, all $500 million; and Ethiopia, India and South Korea, all 
$400 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia, meanwhile, has seen its exports steadily declining since  
the end of the Cold War. In 1991, it sold $8.2 billion in arms. In 
1998, the total had declined to $1.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Developing nations accounted for 69.4 percent of all arms  
purchases from 1991 through 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Major weapons categories in the study included fighter jets,  
helicopters, artillery, tanks and other armored vehicles, 
surface-to-air missiles, surface-to-surface missiles and anti-ship 
missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Congressional Research Service, a branch of the Library of  
Congress, reports each year on weapons and other military equipment 
sales around the world.

<HEADLINE> Vikings Are Stacked at Quarterback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANKATO, Minn. (AP) -- The Minnesota Vikings' high-powered  
offense is more than just the best trio of wide receivers in the 
NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Try the deepest depth chart at quarterback.  
</P>
<P>
	Behind starter Randall Cunningham, who is coming off his best  
year ever, is: Jeff George, who just two years ago threw for 29 
touchdowns; rookie Daunte Culpepper, the franchise's future; and 
Todd Bouman, who lit up NFL Europe this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	New offensive coordinator Ray Sherman, who toiled with the  
Pittsburgh Steelers and erratic quarterback Kordell Stewart last 
season, said he's never seen a team with so many strong arms at 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not like this,'' he said with a smile. ``I love all of them.  
We're very fortunate to have a group of guys like this. Some teams 
don't have two. We're fortunate to have four. 
</P>
<P>
	``They all have strong arms, and for our offense that's what you  
need,'' Sherman added. ``Every one of them has the arm to get the 
ball where we want to put it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that's into the capable hands of Cris Carter, Randy Moss,  
Jake Reed and fourth receiver Matthew Hatchette, the deepest and 
most talented group of wideouts in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	The depth at quarterback provides coach Dennis Green with injury  
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	``That means that regardless of what happens, you got a guy that  
can go on the field and play and still have success in our offense. 
That's important to our style of play,'' Green said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter said the quarterback depth will be especially evident --  
and essential -- during training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really nice because I think offensively the cohesiveness  
from unit to unit will be better,'' Carter said. ``And the 
efficiency of practice is better because you have quality people 
throwing the ball at all times. 
</P>
<P>
	``The second-unit receivers, third-unit receivers, they get  
better balls thrown to them. And I think you'll really see that in 
the preseason. I think you'll see our second- and third-team 
receivers and quarterbacks play at a higher level than the other 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All four quarterbacks have been impressive during the first week  
of drills, when the out-of-sync offense usually struggles to keep 
up with the defense. 
</P>
<P>
	The zip of George's throws have been particularly impressive, as  
have Culpepper's work habits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jeff is a phenomenal talent,'' Carter said. ``Daunte's young.  
He's got a lot of time to grow. He's in a great situation where he 
can learn, not a lot of pressure on him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And of course, Cunningham is coming off the best season of his  
14-year career, a year in which he threw for 3,704 yards and 34 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Randall told me he feels good, he said he's never felt  
better,'' Moss said. ``And he told me he's been working hard. I'm 
ready for Randall. I'm so happy our whole offense stayed 
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The one that scored an NFL record 556 points last season.

<HEADLINE> Student's Software Aces Microsoft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOCORRO, N.M. (AP) -- David beat Goliath again, this time online.  
</P>
<P>
	A free system developed by New Mexico Tech graduate student Cort  
Dougan continued running under repeated attacks from Internet 
intruders after a Microsoft computer had repeated software failures 
during an impromptu computer security competition this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Dougan said he's not a part of the security challenge, but will  
be involved in fixing or diagnosing any security flaws the contest 
uncovers. 
</P>
<P>
	The battle began Tuesday, when Microsoft challenged crackers --  
people who use the Internet to break into other people's computers 
-- to break into a computer running a test version of its new 
Windows 2000 operating system. Windows is the core of Microsoft's 
business and Windows 2000 is the latest version of its operating 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	Within hours, a Wisconsin company also challenged crackers to  
break into a computer running LinuxPPC, a version of a free 
operating system that runs on Macintosh computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's computer crashed at 10:45 a.m., then crashed again  
and again. The Mac, running on Dougan's software, continued 
operating Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A Microsoft spokeswoman blamed the crashes on storms and  
electrical outages Tuesday in the Seattle area, where the computer 
is located. 
</P>
<P>
	But a log posted on the computer showed at least nine crashes  
caused by problems with Microsoft software, not the weather. 
Questioned about that, the spokeswoman said the computer was 
expected to be off line for some periods of time ``as customer 
feedback is assessed and integrated into the system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also acknowledged crackers repeatedly attacked the computer,  
but said company officials did not give her further information on 
the effect of those attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Linux computer logged 6,755 individual attackers by midday  
Thursday but continued running, said Jeff Carr, president of the 
Wisconsin company sponsoring the LinuxPPC challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Linux and Windows are computer operating systems, the underlying  
software that handles a computer's housekeeping chores, such as 
moving data around, printing and displaying information on the 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
	Finnish computer programmer Linus Torvalds decided to create his  
own operating system in 1991. The result came to be known as Linux, 
and Torvalds not only gave it away for free, but also gave away the 
underlying source code, the written instructions that make it work. 
</P>
<P>
	By giving away the code, Torvalds encouraged people to tinker  
with it and improve it. Since then, Torvalds and programmers around 
the world, communicating largely through the Internet, have 
steadily advanced Linux, adapting it to run on more types of 
computers and adding new features. 
</P>
<P>
	Dougan rewrote Linux to run on Motorola's PowerPC chip, which  
runs computers by Macintosh and IBM. 
</P>
<P>
	Linux has grown in popularity, but its sometimes hard-to-use  
features have made mainstream users slow to adopt it. So companies 
have sprung up, including Carr's LinuxPPC Inc., that sell 
prepackaged CD versions easier to install on personal computers.

	GRAPEVINE, Texas (AP) -- A fireball exploded Friday over the  
swimming pool of a newly-opened hotel near Dallas-Fort Worth 
International Airport, critically burning two people and lacerating 
dozens with broken glass. 
</P>
<P>
	No fatalities were reported and police said nobody was trapped  
in the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses told KDFW-TV the blast took place shortly before 7  
p.m. in a ground floor equipment room of the Embassy Suites hotel, 
which had opened Tuesday but remained under construction. 
</P>
<P>
	An eyewitness told the station that he personally pulled five  
burned or bloody survivors from the wreckage. Many of those were 
children who had been in the indoor pool. 
</P>
<P>
	Two witnesses said they smelled a strong odor of natural gas  
both before and after the explosion in a room believed to house the 
heating system for the indoor pool. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grapevine Police Department said six burn victims were taken  
to hospitals for treatment. Two were believed to be in critical 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of other people are being treated by paramedics at the  
scene for cuts caused by flying glass.

<HEADLINE> Man Admits Lying in Yosemite Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORCORAN, Calif. (AP) -- An imprisoned convict whom the FBI was  
relying on to help solve the case of three slain Yosemite National 
Park sightseers says he falsely implicated himself in hopes he'd 
get off easy on unrelated charges. 
</P>
<P>
	During a prison interview with The Associated Press, Eugene  
``Rufus'' Dykes said Thursday that he told investigators so many 
different stories -- some linking himself and others to the murders 
-- that he couldn't think of any more. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they only listened to me from the beginning,'' Dykes said.  
``I told them I didn't do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carole Sund, 42, her daughter, Juli, 15, and family friend  
Silvina Pelosso, 16, vanished on Feb. 15 from the Cedar Lodge in El 
Portal, on Yosemite's western doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, authorities announced that the killers were likely a  
group of people who were already in jail for other crimes. But just 
days later they arrested a handyman for the beheading of Yosemite 
naturalist Joie Ruth Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
	The handyman, Cary Stayner, then confessed to killing the Sunds  
and Pelosso, leading family members of the victims to question why 
investigators spent so much time focusing on a group of jailed 
ex-cons and drug abusers. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Dykes, who is in prison on a parole violation,  
offered a reason why. 
</P>
<P>
	He said when the FBI first interviewed him, he told them he  
never met the three sightseers and had nothing to do with their 
disappearance. But then he started making up stories and telling 
them what he knew about unrelated crimes because they told him 
``everything would be a walk'' as long as he didn't kill any of the 
women, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, Dykes, who has no lawyer, even signed a statement  
saying he killed Carole Sund, slashing her throat at a remote 
mountain spot. He said he had heard there were no bullets at the 
crime scene, so he figured a knife was used. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents repeatedly took him out of jail and drove him around the  
Sierra Nevada foothills, looking for that crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd tell them to stop and I'd get out,'' Dykes said. ``Then  
I'd say 'Nope, this doesn't look familiar.''' 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agent Nick Rossi would not comment Thursday on any of Dykes'  
claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Dykes said he feels badly that someone else died before FBI  
agents caught the alleged killer. He said he doesn't know Stayner, 
who was indicted Thursday in the beheading of Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner, who lived and worked at the Cedar Lodge, has not been  
charged in the sightseers murders, though he is the only suspect 
named by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Dykes, 32, was never identified as a suspect in the sightseers  
case but was at the center of a looseknit band of ``cranksters'' 
that became the focus of investigations by the FBI-led task force 
and a federal grand jury in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
	He got into a standoff with police less than a month after the  
women disappeared, and was locked up on a parole violation. 
</P>
<P>
	Dykes was not clear about why he would implicate himself in a  
possible death penalty case, except to say that as a three-strikes 
candidate, he knew he could be put away for the rest of his life 
for far less. He said if that was the case, he would rather 
incriminate himself for a crime he didn't commit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why half step?'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Hospital Panel Won't Announce Visits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The organization that certifies the safety of  
80 percent of the nation's hospitals will no longer notify 
hospitals before making what it had billed as ``unannounced'' 
visits to inspect them, the group said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement follows a report from the Department of Health  
and Human Services' inspector general said the current system for 
ensuring patient safety is too lax. 
</P>
<P>
	The Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare  
Organizations now gives hospitals at least 24 hours notice before 
an ``unannounced'' survey and tells them what areas are to be 
examined. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning in January, the commission will give hospitals no  
advance notice of the ``unannounced'' surveys and will base its 
inspections on problems known to exist at each hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``The notice was intended as a courtesy and to try to be sure  
the hospitals' leaders would be available,'' said Janet McIntyre, a 
spokeswoman for the commission. ``The announced period really 
wasn't enough time to make any substantial changes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said the policy was being changed because of negative  
perceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think that this step ... will strengthen the public's  
perception of accreditation as being a probing process,'' McIntyre 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspector general's report identified several other problems  
with the inspection regime: 
</P>
<P>
	--Reviewers lack time to poke around a hospital to find  
unexpected problems. 
</P>
<P>
	--They are not briefed on a hospital's background and troubles it  
may have had. 
</P>
<P>
	--Hospitals are allowed to choose which medical records are  
examined. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer advocate Sidney Wolfe of Public Citizen dismissed the  
changes as meaningless, saying that the so-called unannounced 
surveys accounted for only about 5 percent of the inspection 
visits. The other 95 percent, he said, are scheduled and hospitals 
are aware when they will occur well in advance.

<HEADLINE> Job Report Raises Economists Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Businesses added more than 300,000 jobs to  
their payrolls and increased wages by a larger-than-expected amount 
in July -- good news for workers, but worrisome to economists 
anticipating another interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve. 
The unemployment rate held steady at 4.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported Friday that employers hired  
310,000 new people last month, well above many analysts' forecasts. 
Temporary help agencies, restaurants, computer companies, 
engineering firms posted big gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Even manufacturers added 31,000 jobs in July, only the sector's  
second increase in 16 months. Still, manufacturing employment is 
459,000 lower than in March 1998, as suffering continues in many 
industries from a global currency crisis that has cut U.S. exports 
and increased competition from cheaper-priced imports. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, workers' average hourly earnings -- a key gauge  
of inflation pressure -- also rose in July by a larger-than-expected 
3.8 percent compared to a year ago, the second straight monthly 
increase. The 3.8 percent increase compared to a 3.7 percent rise 
in June and was the biggest year-over-year gain since a 4 percent 
increase in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Against this backdrop, the July jobless rate matched the June  
number and was still near May's 29-year low of 4.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets, fearing higher interest rates, reacted with  
concern. The Dow Jones stock average closed down 79.79 points to 
10,714.03, and bond prices were falling as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The low unemployment rate, big job gains and strong wage growth  
in July's report appear to be good developments for workers, but 
economists worry that it's a recipe for sparking inflation. Their 
fear: Employers scrambling to find workers woo them with higher 
wages and benefits, costs likely to drive up consumer prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tight labor market is finally starting to result in faster  
growth in wages, and that's of concern to the Federal Reserve,'' 
said Paul Kasriel, senior economist with Northern Trust in Chicago. 
``This seals the fate for a quarter-point increase (in interest 
rates) when the Fed meets on Aug. 24.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch's chief economist Bruce Steinberg agreed. ``The  
size of the payroll gain is just too much for the Fed,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's report was the third showing an acceleration in wage  
pressures. On Thursday, the government said unit labor costs rose 
at the fastest pace since the end of 1997, and the government said 
last week the Employment Cost Index, which measures wages and 
benefits, climbed at its most rapid pace in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress two weeks  
ago the Fed would move ``promptly and forcefully'' to combat 
inflation generated from tight labor markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists expect Fed policy-makers to vote at their next  
meeting on Aug. 24 to increase by another quarter point the federal 
funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other. The Fed 
increased the funds rate to 5 percent on June 30, the first 
increase in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed's aim is to raise interest rates enough to slow economic  
growth by dampening loan demand on the part of consumers and 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Politicians often criticize the central bank for raising  
interest rates, President Clinton refused to Friday when reporters 
gave him the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should do everything we can, those of us with political  
responsibilities in the government, to fight inflationary pressures 
so we continue to create jobs and raise incomes without 
inflation,'' Clinton said. ``So I'm doing my best to hold inflation 
down, and that's the signal that I want to send today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 310,000 gain in payroll jobs for July far exceeded many  
analysts' expectations. They had been forecasting a gain of around 
230,000 jobs, following an increase in June of 273,000. The July 
increase in payrolls was well above the monthly average of the 
first six months of the year of 208,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Average hourly earnings rose 0.5 percent in July over the level  
in June. Many analysts expected 0.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> States Impose Water Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FURMAN, S.C. (AP) -- Bob Youman's corn crop has already fallen  
victim to the drought and extreme heat parching fields in this 
farming crossroads. But he still has hope for his soybeans and 
cotton -- if long-awaited rain comes quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had prospects for one of the best cotton crops in years. It  
doesn't look that way now,'' Youmans, who with his family operates 
Youmans Farms, said Thursday. ``Things can turn around, but time is 
running out. The clock is ticking real fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without rain in the next week or so, the cotton will end up like  
the corn. And the soybeans, with their drooping leaves, also need 
water. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolinians weren't alone as farmers and residents up and  
down the East Coast and as far inland as Kentucky dealt with 
another day of dry conditions Thursday while state officials took 
action to ease water usage. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland, facing its worst drought in 70 years, was the first  
state to impose statewide restrictions on water use. The emergency 
restrictions, announced by Gov. Parris Glendening on Wednesday and 
enforceable by a $1,000 fine or six months in jail, shut down car 
washes, fountains and most other outdoor watering. 
</P>
<P>
	Delaware Gov. Thomas Carper on Thursday declared a drought  
emergency and mandatory water restrictions for two-thirds of the 
state's estimated 724,000 residents who live in the northern tip. 
Violators will be subject to fines from $50 to $500. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman also declared a drought  
emergency Thursday that allows the state to impose mandatory water 
restrictions and fines up to $1,000. The state's 13 reservoirs are 
at nearly 9 percent below normal capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	In West Virginia, where the dry spell has caused an estimated  
$100 million in damage to farms, Gov. Cecil Underwood made plans to 
hold a special legislative session to allocate relief money for 
drought-stricken farms. 
</P>
<P>
	And in New York, Gov. George Pataki has requested federal  
disaster assistance for farmers in the Southern Tier of the state, 
where irrigation sources such as ponds and streams are drying up. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Virginia Department of Health officials said more  
than 1 million dead fish found earlier this week at Captain's Cove 
near the Maryland border were the apparent victims of excessive 
heat that depleted oxygen in the water. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina farmers are dealing with drought conditions for  
the second time in as many seasons. Last year's drought resulted in 
a federal disaster declaration. 
</P>
<P>
	``A farmer has to be completely crazy or have a deep and abiding  
faith in the supreme maker and architect of this universe,'' the 
67-year-old Youmans said. ``We have always labored under that 
assumption that if you do your very best, there will be a way. But, 
sometimes, it shakes your faith.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state is expected to declare a moderate drought next week, a  
more severe status than the incipient drought declared back in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're parched,'' said Hugh Gray, the Clemson Extension Service  
agent for Hampton County, where Youmans' farm is located. ``We may 
not be the worst in the state. But a day or two more without rain 
and everyone will be in the boat.''

<HEADLINE> AHP Is More Than a Diet Drug Maker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The nation's seventh largest pharmaceutical maker, American Home  
Products makes most of its money from prescription drugs, though 
its signature products are the popular over-the-counter brands 
Advil pain reliever, Chap Stick lip balm and Robitussin cough 
syrup. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also sells Centrum vitamins and Preparation H  
hemorrhoids medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, American Home Product's top-selling prescription drug  
has been Premarin, an estrogen replacement which is the most widely 
prescribed pill in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The Madison, N.J. company is also the maker of the implantable  
birth control device Norplant. Hundreds of patients have sued 
American Home Products over the contraceptive's side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, a jury in Canton, Texas, awarded $23.36 million to a  
woman who claimed she suffered heart-valve damage after taking the 
company's weight-loss pill, fenfluramine -- part of the fen-phen 
diet drug combination. Company lawyers promised to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranked No. 117 on the Fortune 500 list, American Home Products  
last year made a $2.47 billion profit on $13.46 billion in sales. 
Prescription drug sales account for about 70 percent of the 
company's revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	The company last fall called off a merger with St. Louis-based  
life sciences company Monsanto. It also has had merger talks with 
British drugmaker SmithKline Beecham. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home also makes pesticides and animal health products.

<HEADLINE> Gordon Takes Third Brickyard Pole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Even as he celebrated winning the Brickyard  
400 pole, Jeff Gordon was still bubbling about having a road named 
after him a day earlier in his former hometown of Pittsboro, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's so neat,'' Gordon said Thursday. ``It isn't some little  
street, either. It's right on the exit to the Interstate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, who also celebrated his 28th birthday on Wednesday,  
could wind up having the 2 1/2-mile Indianapolis Motor Speedway oval 
named in his honor someday if he continues his mastery of the 
historic track. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kid won the inaugural NASCAR race at the speedway in 1994  
and won it again last year, becoming the only two-time winner of 
the event. His record-setting lap on Thursday gave him three poles 
in six tries at Indy. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon's lap of 179.612 mph took the top starting spot for  
Saturday's race and broke the record of 179.394 set last August by 
Ernie Irvan. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a special place,'' Gordon said. ``I love coming here.  
And the fan reaction makes it even more special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Booed at most other tracks, Gordon -- who spent most of his teen  
years in nearby Pittsboro -- is a crowd favorite at Indy. Cheers 
rang throughout the sprawling track as his lap was announced on the 
public address system. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a lot of people who pull for us here,'' Gordon said.  
``If I had a home track or a hometown maybe that supported me, it 
probably would be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although he enjoyed the reception of the estimated 50,000 people  
scattered over the vast grandstands, Gordon said he was surprised 
to be on the pole. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tell you, I'm shocked,'' he said, smiling. ``I knew we had a  
strong car; I just thought we drew too early a number.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon was fourth of the 55 drivers in the qualifying line.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the one who drew the number, so I just thought I'd have to  
make the most of it,'' he said. ``We were pretty happy with that 
lap, but I really thought somebody would beat me, especially if 
they caught a cloud when they went out. This track is very 
sensitive to temperature changes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Martin came closest, at 178.941, followed by surprising  
David Green -- matching his best career start -- with a lap of 
178.902, series points leader Dale Jarrett at 178.859 and Michael 
Waltrip at 178.816. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, who has won two straight Winston Cup titles and three of  
the last four, is having a disappointing season. Despite winning 
four races -- matching Jeff Burton for the season high -- and leading 
the series way with seven poles, he is a distant sixth in the 
standings. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of his problems have been mechanical and have kept him from  
finishing five of the 19 races thus far in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think really our thought process right now is to try not to  
have failures and problems that have kept us behind and put us 
where we are now,'' Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin said there's no big secret about why Gordon is so good at  
Indy. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a better driver than at least most of us, if not all of  
us,'' Martin said. ``I think he drives a better car than most of 
us, if not all of us. Put that all together and that's a hard 
combination to beat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dale Earnhardt, another fan favorite and the 1995 Brickyard  
winner, was third from last in line and came up with a lap of 
177.791 that was good enough to qualify in the 18th spot. 
</P>
<P>
	The top 25 were locked in starting positions in the 43-car  
field, with the rest of the drivers getting another opportunity 
today to improve their qualifying speeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Darrell Waltrip, who made it official earlier Thursday that he  
will retire from the cockpit after a season-long farewell tour in 
2000, followed Earnhardt onto the track with the knowledge that he 
must qualify among the top 36 or fail to make the race field. 
</P>
<P>
	Positions 37 through 43 are based on team-owner points and  
Waltrip has already used up his allotment of what are known as 
provisional starts. 
</P>
<P>
	As he prepared to drive onto the track, his engine died and,  
with the five-minute clock running, his crew worked desperately to 
get the car going again. They finally found a loose battery cable 
and got it going with less than a minute to spare. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good thing it came off when it did. If it came off  
during my run, I'd be in trouble,'' said the three-time Winston Cup 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip's hopes for making the race remained alive as he  
qualified 32nd at 176.478. But he had to decide whether to stand on 
that lap or try again today. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the kind of run that keeps you up all night,'' Waltrip  
said. ``Thirty-second is right where you don't want to be -- 30th is 
a no-brainer, 34th is a no-brainer. But 32nd ... I have a tendency 
to not let other people beat me. I like to beat myself.''

<HEADLINE> Two Plead Innocent To Gun Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Two men from Northern Ireland  
pleaded innocent to charges they illegally mailed guns and bullets 
from Florida to Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Smyth, 42, and Conor Claxton, 26, were among four people  
indicted July 26 for conspiring to export firearms without a 
license, exporting guns without export licenses, and using the U.S. 
Postal Service to illegally export handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Claxton admitted involvement with the Irish  
Republican Army after his arrest last week, but his attorney denied 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment said Smyth and another defendant, Siobhan Browne,  
bought 44 handguns from a gun dealer and mailed 15 of the weapons 
to Ireland and Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Browne, 34, a citizen of the Republic of Ireland, on  
Thursday put off entering a plea until next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Co-defendant Martin Mullan, a Belfast native, was denied bond at  
a hearing Thursday in Philadelphia, where he was living at the time 
of the indictment. Mullan will be transported to Florida for 
arraignment and trial along with the others.

<HEADLINE> Cocaine Charges for Commander's Wife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The wife of an Army colonel who oversaw the  
U.S. military's counternarcotics operations in Colombia faces 
charges of shipping cocaine to the United States, U.S. officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Laurie Hiett, wife of Army Col. James Hiett, was charged in June  
with conspiracy to distribute narcotics after the U.S. Customs 
Service found parcels containing cocaine, including one package in 
New York that carried Mrs. Hiett's name as its return address, the 
officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A warrant for her arrest has been issued by the U.S. Eastern  
District Court in New York, according to Navy Lt. Jane Campbell, a 
spokeswoman for the U.S. Southern Command in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	James Hiett was U.S. military group commander at the U.S.  
Embassy in Bogota at the time. In that job, he was in charge of all 
U.S. military activities in Colombia, including counterdrug 
operations, according to Col. Ron Williams, a Southern Command 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said Hiett requested to be removed from the post after  
the allegations arose and his transfer is pending. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigation by the Army Criminal Investigation Division in  
Panama found ``no prior knowledge'' by Hiett of cocaine shipments 
to the United States involving his wife, Williams said. The 
investigation cleared Hiett of any involvement in criminal 
activity, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams referred a reporter to the New York prosecutor's office  
for information about Mrs. Hiett. 
</P>
<P>
	The Village Voice newspaper reported on its Internet Web site  
Thursday that a search warrant application said Mrs. Hiett admitted 
to federal investigators she had mailed six packages for ``her 
husband's chauffeur,'' but claimed that she did not know the 
contents of the parcels. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 23, according to the Village Voice, one of those parcels  
was searched by U.S. Customs agents in Miami and was found to 
contain 2.7 pounds of cocaine. Later a second parcel was 
intercepted in New York and also found to contain cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	The first package carried Mrs. Hiett's name as its return  
address and was mailed from Bogota, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombia ranks third on the list of U.S. aid recipients with  
$289 million earmarked for counterdrug activity this year. Barry 
McCaffrey, the White House drug control chief, said recently an 
additional $1 billion was needed because current efforts were 
falling short. He said the situation had reached ``emergency'' 
proportions. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug war also is costing the United States in other ways:  
Five U.S. soldiers were killed two weeks ago when their U.S. Army 
spy plane crashed into a Colombian mountainside while on a 
counternarcotics mission.

<HEADLINE> Late Actress' Dog Lives in Splendor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Malcolm the 14-year-old pug is still recovering  
from the death of his mistress, actress Sylvia Sidney. But he's 
adjusting in splendor. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Sidney died July 1 and left Malcolm to the National Arts  
Club, which offers lodging to members on Manhattan's tony Gramercy 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's quite popular,'' club President Aldon James told The  
Associated Press on Friday. ``I think Sylvia would want him as a 
member.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Sidney belonged to the club and would frequently bring  
Malcolm. 
</P>
<P>
	James said Malcolm pines for his mistress, but a diet of lamb  
chops, ``very lean'' roast beef and dietetic dog food is keeping 
him happy. Malcolm sleeps with a red slipper that had belonged to 
Ms. Sidney. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like his tranquilizer, his pacifier,'' James said.  
</P>
<P>
	The pug, who spends a lot of time at the front desk, is going to  
be inducted into the club -- a requirement for living there.

<HEADLINE> Online Auctioneer eBay Crashes Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Online auction company eBay Inc.  
sustained yet another site outage Friday, interrupting trading of 
its 2.6 million items for more than 9 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors weren't pleased, pushing shares of eBay down $9.62 1/2,  
or 10 percent, to $83.25 in trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't tell you how badly I personally feel about this,''  
said eBay chief executive officer Meg Whitman. ``It's obviously a 
great disservice to our community. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second biggest outage in eBay history. In June, it  
was down for nearly a full day, costing the company $3.9 million in 
lost revenue. EBay said it did not know how much this outage would 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials said the problems that first caused the outage  
at 7:20 a.m. EDT were quickly corrected. But when the system was 
rebooted, ``network anomalies'' arose, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	The site, which had 5.6 million registered users last quarter,  
remained down until 4 p.m. EDT. Trading was not possible until an 
hour later. 
</P>
<P>
	EBay said it would extend all auctions that were under way  
before the outage began. They also will refund fees for auctions 
scheduled to end during the outage. 
</P>
<P>
	One expert said if eBay does not manage to avoid these kinds of  
system outages, it will sustain heavy losses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Simply building a massive customer base isn't going to secure  
their customer base in the future,'' said Richard Whitehead, a vice 
president at Micromuse, a software firm that writes software to 
manage online computer breakdowns.

<HEADLINE> Gwynn Is Padres' Batsman Forever </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Tony Gwynn is one consistent guy.  
</P>
<P>
	He's played for only one team in his 18-year career, the San  
Diego Padres. He's hit better than .300 for 16 straight seasons and 
is tied for Honus Wagner with eight NL batting titles. 
</P>
<P>
	He got his first two hits in his major league debut on July 19,  
1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Hit No. 1 was a double off Philadelphia's Sid Monge. On the  
field that night was Pete Rose, who would become baseball's career 
hit king. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rose trailed the play and said, `Congratulations. Don't catch  
me in one night,''' Gwynn said. ``That's always going to stick with 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Going into Friday night's game at Montreal, Gwynn needed just  
one more hit to reach 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	He was in a rush to get it, too, having said he'd like to beat  
longtime contemporary Wade Boggs to the mark. Boggs had 2,997 hits 
going into Friday night's home game for Tampa Bay against 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter who got there first, Gwynn and Boggs were bound to  
become the 22nd and 23rd members of the 3,000-hit club. 
</P>
<P>
	But getting to the brink wasn't a breeze for Gwynn, 39.  
</P>
<P>
	After a hot April, he strained his left calf breaking out of the  
batter's box on May 21 and ended up making two trips to the 
disabled list, missing 44 games. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed all but two of the Padres' franchise-record 14-game  
winning streak in late June-early July. Gwynn, one of the most 
affable and accessible players in the majors, was frustrated. Not 
as much that his drive for 3,000 hit the skids, but because he was 
missing out on an exciting stretch for the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been very uncomfortable, very difficult,'' Gwynn said  
recently. ``I just want to get there as quickly as possible and get 
back to normal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn uttered those words even before Jim Leyritz took a potshot  
just before he was traded from the Padres to the New York Yankees, 
hinting that Gwynn wasn't exactly a team player. 
</P>
<P>
	The same thing often was said about Boggs, a five-time AL  
batting champion and a left-hander hitter like Gwynn. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Gwynn tried to imitate Boggs in his early years.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was the hitter I wanted to be like,'' said Gwynn, who won  
his first batting title the year after Boggs won his first. ``He 
became the hunted. I wanted to emulate him. So for me, there's a 
connection because we're both similar in our approach, except that 
Wade's a whole lot more patient. He was the guy I had to chase.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Gwynn, that approach has been to put the ball in play using  
all fields. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it didn't count in his career totals, Gwynn's favorite  
hit was his homer to right field in the first game of last year's 
World Series at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, Gwynn loves to carve hits the other way. He became so  
proficient at hitting between third base and shortstop that he 
began calling it the ``5.5 Hole'' -- in baseball scoring, the third 
baseman is represented by 5 and the shortstop, 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn even has ``5.5 Hole'' patches on the tongue of his cleats.  
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn played basketball and baseball at San Diego State, and it  
wasn't until his senior season that he decided to stick with 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	He loved basketball and thought he might have a shot at the NBA,  
but didn't start half the games due to an injury suffered the 
previous summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was sitting on the bench and thinking, `I've got to think  
about my career here.' It just dawned on me that I probably had a 
better chance at baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``And about halfway through my senior year I started sneaking  
down to the baseball field and hitting in the cage and taking 
ground balls and stuff. So by the time basketball season ended and 
I went out to play baseball, I was kind of ready, where before I 
would just go straight from basketball to baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was a third-round draft pick of the Padres in June 1981, and  
made his big league debut a little more than a year later. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn won his first batting title in 1984. He won the other  
seven in bunches, from 1987-89, and 1994-97. 
</P>
<P>
	As he got older he seemed to get better, never hitting lower  
than .353 from '93-'97. Last year he fell off to .321, but did hit 
.500 in the World Series as the Padres were swept by the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	His best year was 1994, when he was batting .394 when the  
players' strike began. It was the highest in the majors since Ted 
Williams batted .406 in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the break I was hitting .383 and was really on a good  
roll,'' Gwynn said. ``I was hitting the ball hard and using all 
fields. If I was going to hit .400, I knew that was going to be my 
best crack at it. Unfortunately for me and everyone else, we didn't 
finish the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, that was the year I was doing a whole lot of things  
right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For a guy who's hit .339 for his career -- the best among active  
big leaguers -- a lot of people would say he's done a whole lot of 
things right his entire career.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mostly Down; Dow Off 112.40 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly lower today, with blue-chip  
shares coming under selling pressure amid concerns about interest 
rates. Scattered technology stocks rose on bargain hunting. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 112.40 at 10,681.42, erasing nearly all of the Dow's 119-point 
gain of yesterday. Broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The 
Nasdaq composite index, dominated by technology issues, was down 
10.77 at 2,555.06. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks fell after the Labor Department reported employers added  
a larger-than-expected 310,000 jobs to their payrolls in July and 
that average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures, 
rose 3.8 percent from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors have grown increasingly worried that tight labor  
markets will force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates as a 
pre-emptive strike against inflation. Higher interest rates cut 
into corporate profits by raising the cost of borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Fed needed fuel to consider raising rates, they have it  
now with these new numbers,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior vice 
president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. ``The strong jobs report tilted the 
optimists upside down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department also reported the unemployment rate  
remained at 4.3 percent last month, near a three-decade low. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices fell sharply on the report, pushing the yield on  
Treasury's 30-year bond up to 6.14 percent from 6.04 percent late 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest rate concerns hurt financial services stocks. J.P.  
Morgan fell 2 3/8 to 123 1/8 and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter was off 3 
15/16 at 82 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stock market is trying really hard to fight reality right  
now -- interest rates will probably be rising,'' said Brian G. 
Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co., in 
Kansas City, Mo. ``But some sectors can't escape the selling 
pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the broad market was down today, bargain hunters were  
buying technology issues that have dropped sharply over the past 
three weeks. The Nasdaq composite is down 11 percent from its all 
time-high reached July 16. The Dow is down more than 4 percent from 
its record high. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo was slipping back from early gains that were helped along  
by a Goldman Sachs analyst's upgrade. Its shares were up 3/8 at 128 3/4. 
America Online was up 1 1/16 at 85. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough to call all the turns in this market,'' Ackerman  
said. ``It is like the Indianapolis 500. Everything keeps changing 
lap after lap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 13-to-6 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 461.89 million 
shares, down from 606.53 million shares on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 7.31 at 610.08, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was up 0.99 at 777.08. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was down 1.65 at  
428.10.

<HEADLINE>  Deutsche Telekom To Buy One2One </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Deutsche Telekom is buying the British mobile  
phone business One2One for $11 billion, trying to get back on track 
in its transformation from former state monopoly to global 
communications company. 
</P>
<P>
	Telekom, no longer protected from competition on its home turf  
in Germany, unsuccessfully sought to merge with Telecom Italia 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only did the bid fail, but the solo attempt soured Telekom's  
ties with partner France Telecom, which declared their relationship 
over. 
</P>
<P>
	And now, France Telecom is trying to push Telekom out of their  
Global One alliance with Sprint Corp. and an Italian joint venture 
called Wind. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts praised the One2One deal announced Friday, but only as  
a first step toward competing in an increasingly global market 
dominated by Internet and wireless communications. About 95 percent 
of Telekom's annual sales still come from the German market. 
</P>
<P>
	One2One, the smallest of Britain's four mobile phone companies,  
is jointly owned by Cable and Wireless PLC of London and MediaOne 
Group, the Colorado-based cable TV concern being acquired by AT&AMP;T. 
</P>
<P>
	``Strategically, the acquisition makes sense, as access to new  
customers is becoming more and more important,'' said Holger Grawe, 
an analyst at West LB Research in Duesseldorf. 
</P>
<P>
	But Grawe said it is still ``pivotal'' for Telekom to sort out  
its disagreements with companies in other European markets and 
increase its cooperation with Sprint. 
</P>
<P>
	Telekom boss Ron Sommer has expressed keen interest in the U.S.  
market, and Telekom's 10 percent holding in Sprint makes that 
company the most likely acquisition target, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Telekom, which is still partly state-owned, raised about $11  
billion in June through a stock offering. 
</P>
<P>
	Sommer, who had said the cash would be used to finance  
acquisitions and mergers, asserted that the One2One deal was an 
important move in a key European market. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are acquiring an attractive and well-managed mobile  
telephone operator with a strong brand name and considerable growth 
potential,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	One2One has 2.6 million subscribers in the United Kingdom.  
Telekom's T-Mobil subsidiary has 7.4 million customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition of One2One is expected to be completed by the  
end of September, pending approval by European Union regulators and 
Telekom's supervisory board. 
</P>
<P>
	Telekom expects T-Mobil and One2One to expand roaming  
capabilities for customers of both services and save money in such 
areas as technology and procurement. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Schatzschneider, analyst at BHF Bank in Frankfurt, said  
he saw only ``limited synergy effects'' from the One2One deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it will certainly improve Telekom's position for the  
upcoming bidding for the next generation UMTS mobile phone 
licenses,'' he said, referring to the new format called Universal 
Mobile Telecommunications Systems. 
</P>
<P>
	UMTS is expected to speed data communications and end the  
incompatibility between wireless systems in the United States and 
Europe. The first European bidding for UMTS licenses is expected 
next year.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: GOP Tax Cut Will Not Happen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Only hours after Republicans pushed their  
10-year, $792 billion tax bill through Congress, President Clinton 
declared today that ``this tax cut will not become law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton repeated his determination to veto the bill as he left  
the White House for a trip to Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said he is willing to consider limited tax cuts  
using projected budget surpluses, but only after Social Security 
and Medicare are safeguarded for the future, public debt is paid 
down and sufficient levels of spending are ensured for education, 
defense, environmental protection and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is how we ought to determine the size of the tax cut,''  
Clinton told reporters on the White House lawn. ``We are doing it 
backwards. The amount should be determined not by politics, but by 
arithmetic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president ticked off a list of economic milestones achieved  
during his administration, including the low 4.3 percent jobless 
rate for July announced today. He also asserted that a tax cut 
could trigger inflation, which would lead to higher interest rates 
for mortgages, car loans and credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should not abandon a strategy that is working,'' Clinton  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because this tax cut will not save and strengthen Medicare,  
because it will not add a day to the Social Security trust fund, 
because it will not pay down the debt and pay it off for the first 
time in 150 years, this tax cut will not become law,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's declaration came as Congress embarked on its August  
recess after approving the tax cut Thursday. Republican leaders 
hope to whip up public support for the bill during the recess 
before sending it to Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said today  
Republicans hope such public pressure will force the president to 
do ``one of the Clintonian 180s'' and reverse his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if he vetoes this bill, it will be the strongest  
indication so far that he is entering the phase of being a lame 
duck,'' Lott told reporters. ``It will say to the Congress and the 
American people: 'I don't care what you say or do, I'm going to 
veto this.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Many moderate Democrats and Republicans say it would be better  
to figure out how to devise a smaller compromise tax cut with a 
chance at becoming law. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, we can come back and do it one more time in a  
better fashion,'' said Sen. John Breaux, D-La. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the veto threat, Republicans won an important victory  
for a bedrock political issue with what would be the largest tax 
cut since President Reagan's in 1981. The Senate approved the bill 
Thursday, 50-49, after it cleared the House 221-206. Both the House 
and Senate adjourned until Sept. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	``Individuals and families are due a refund, and that is exactly  
what we do with this legislation,'' said Sen. William Roth, R-Del., 
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. ``Government is not 
automatically entitled to the surplus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With little chance of becoming law, the bill will serve mainly  
as a defining issue between Republicans and Democrats in the 2000 
struggle for control of Congress and the race for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would trim the bottom 15 percent income tax rate to 14  
percent in 2003 and reduce the other rates by 1 percentage point in 
2005. Relief from the ``marriage penalty'' that affects millions of 
two-income couples would begin in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The estate tax would be repealed gradually starting in 2003, and  
capital gains taxes would be cut from 20 percent to 18 percent for 
most investors retroactive to Jan. 1, 1999. There are breaks for 
education and health care, expanded IRAs and pensions and a legion 
of breaks for businesses large and small. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats portrayed the package as primarily favoring the  
wealthy and business and conservative groups. They said it unwisely 
uses a third of the next decade's projected $2.9 trillion budget 
surplus for tax cuts at the expense of safeguarding Social Security 
and Medicare, repaying the national debt and preventing deep cuts 
in government spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is radical, it is risky, and it is reckless,'' said Sen.  
Kent Conrad, D-N.D. 
</P>
<P>
	Most polls show the public considers cutting taxes a lower  
priority than ensuring that there is enough Social Security money 
to handle baby boomer retirements. Nearly half the public thinks 
wealthy people would benefit most from the tax cuts, according to 
an ABC News poll of 1,012 adults taken July 28-Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	That poll, which had a margin of error of plus or minus 3  
percentage points, indicated that about a fourth of the people 
thought the cuts would benefit everyone equally, while 14 percent 
said it would benefit middle-income people most, and 6 percent said 
the poor would benefit most. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said such polls only demonstrate that they are  
acting on principle by returning some of the surplus in the form of 
tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know it may not be the single most popular thing, but it's  
the right thing to do,'' said Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, however, claimed that the motive for the tax cuts was  
the GOP's desire to curry the favor of business and conservative 
political supporters. ``A wish list so that every contributor ... 
will get a promise,'' Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., called it. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation was crammed with dozens of items sought by  
business lobbyists that total $60 billion over 10 years, according 
to Democrats. Some examples: 
</P>
<P>
	--Business and restaurant lobbyists would gain an increase in the  
deduction for business meals from 50 percent to 60 percent, costing 
$3.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	--For Silicon Valley firms and other manufacturers, would get a  
five-year extension of the research and development tax credit, 
worth $13.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	--For chicken farmers, a new credit for electricity produced from  
poultry waste, along with a four-year extension of biomass and wind 
electricity credits, about $534 million. 
</P>
<P>
	All Democratic senators and four Republicans voted no: Arlen  
Specter of Pennsylvania, George Voinovich of Ohio and Olympia Snowe 
and Susan Collins, both of Maine. The lone absent senator was 
Republican Mike Crapo of Idaho, who was attending his daughter's 
wedding but supported the tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Five Democrats supported the measure in the House and four  
Republicans voted against.

<HEADLINE> Married Couples Fare Best in Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While all taxpayers would get some benefit if  
the Republican tax cut were the law today, married couples earning 
less than $100,000 would get the biggest percentage reduction. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-year, $792 billion tax cut approved by Congress would  
have widely different effects on individual taxpayers, depending on 
their marital status, number of children, investments and claimed 
deductions, according to an analysis by the Deloitte &AMP; Touche 
accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	In terms of total dollars, the wealthiest taxpayers would get  
the most money back -- about 60 percent of the overall cut would go 
to the top 10 percent income bracket. But married couples of 
middle- and upper-middle class incomes would benefit from the 
largest percentage cut in taxes owed. 
</P>
<P>
	Deloitte &AMP; Touche found that married couples earning between  
$50,000 and $100,000 -- with or without children -- would see tax 
reductions of 6.8 percent to 17.9 percent if the Republican tax 
bill became law today. 
</P>
<P>
	Single people in those same income categories, however, would  
receive a tax cut of 4.4 percent to 5.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	This is partly because lawmakers targeted the ``marriage  
penalty'' now paid by millions of two-income couples by proposing 
to double the standard deduction for joint tax filers and 
increasing the amount of income subject to the lowest income tax 
rate -- currently 15 percent but 14 percent under the GOP bill. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, married couples with children, and those with  
children in college, can lower their taxes under current law by 
claiming $500-a-child and education tax credits. Those credits 
would not change. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican bill, which President Clinton threatened again  
Friday to veto as too large, would make dozens of changes to tax 
laws affecting individuals and business, but the analysis focused 
on the sections that would affect the greatest number of people. 
</P>
<P>
	These include a 1 percentage point reduction in all five income  
tax rates, a doubling of the standard deduction for married people, 
a widening of the lowest tax bracket for married people and a cut 
in capital gains taxes on investments from 20 percent to 18 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the cuts would be phased in between 2000 and 2009 and  
are not fully in effect until the final year, Deloitte &AMP; Touche 
examined what would happen if all changes were in place for the 
current 1999 tax year. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's a look at five different scenarios if the GOP tax cut  
proposals were in effect: 
</P>
<P>
	--A single taxpayer with no children earning $35,000 a year with  
no capital gains tax and standard deductions would owe $4,199 in 
income taxes, compared with $4,479 under current law. That's a 6.2 
percent cut and a savings of $280. 
</P>
<P>
	--A married couple with no children earning $48,500 a year and  
$1,500 in capital gains -- with itemized deductions of $12,500 -- 
would owe $4,405, down from $4,725, a cut of 6.8 percent and 
savings of $320. 
</P>
<P>
	--A married couple with two children under age 17 earning $72,750  
and $2,250 in capital gains with $15,750 in itemized deductions 
would owe $5,643, down from $6,734. That's a 16.2 percent tax cut, 
or $1,091. 
</P>
<P>
	--A married couple with one child under 17 and one in college,  
earning $100,000 a year including $3,000 in capital gains -- and 
$20,000 in itemized deductions -- would owe $11,165, down from 
$12,984. That's a drop of 14 percent, or $1,819. 
</P>
<P>
	--A married couple with no children earning $1 million a year,  
including $30,000 in capital gains, with $153,798 in itemized 
deductions would owe $292,517, down from $302,377. That's a cut of 
3.3 percent, or $9,861.

<HEADLINE> Holocaust Insurance Money Resolved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Five European insurers are seeking changes in  
a proposal for determining the current value of insurance policies 
held by Jewish victims of the Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Eagleburger, chairman of an international Holocaust-era  
insurance claims commission, was expected to take final action 
today on valuing the insurance policies. That could clear the way 
for payment of claims to begin later in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the German insurance company Allianz said all  
five European insurers, in varying degrees, are requesting 
modifications in Eagleburger's findings. 
</P>
<P>
	``The concerns are not only about the money, but about the  
process as well,'' spokesman Nicolai Tewes said Thursday in a 
telephone interview from Munich, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a misunderstanding that the companies are only  
trying to save some money,'' Tewes said. ``The companies want to 
find a process that works and makes sense to the people who are 
waiting for the money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to a participant, Eagleburger, the former secretary of  
state, decided to place a ``real value'' of about 10 times the 
prewar face value on policies issued by Allianz. 
</P>
<P>
	Eagleburger used a complex formula linked in part to long-term  
German bonds. A five-day period for registering objections ended 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Allianz spokesman declined to provide details, but offered  
assurances that ``we are still committed to the commission and we 
would like to continue to work with the commission to resolve all 
the open issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eagleburger stepped in when the commission could not agree on a  
formula to determine the current value of policies taken out some 
six decades ago. It factors in inflation and interest. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear how much money could be at stake.  
</P>
<P>
	Some European insurers have questioned the valuation formula and  
indicated they may pull out of the process. 
</P>
<P>
	``They could do whatever they want,'' Elan Steinberg, executive  
director of the World Jewish Congress, said in an interview. ``But 
the consumer and state insurance regulators would not look kindly 
to insurance companies reneging on their commitments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The next step is a meeting of the commission at the end of the  
month in London to adopt a process for compiling lists of 
policyholders and communicating with the families of the victims of 
Nazi persecution. 
</P>
<P>
	The aim is to begin payments at the end of October.  
</P>
<P>
	The commission has representatives from five major European  
companies, Jewish groups and American regulators. Earlier, they 
agreed on a formula for payment on policies issued in Eastern 
European countries.

<HEADLINE> Red Hat's Stock Offer Backfires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An attempt by Red Hat Inc. to be nice to the  
volunteers who help make its Linux software -- by giving them an 
early chance to buy the company's stock -- has backfired. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the volunteer programmers are irate after online  
brokerage ETrade, which is distributing Red Hat stock over the 
Internet in an initial public offering, said they didn't meet its 
trading requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation flared after Red Hat chief executive Robert Young  
on July 20 sent an e-mail to the programmers, offering them the 
opportunity to buy IPO shares by opening an account at ETrade. But 
after filling out an online form, many applicants were rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Hat, based in Durham, N.C., is expected to launch its IPO as  
early as next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am deeply offended by this behavior,'' said Eric Raymond, a  
Linux programmer and consultant who was turned down for the IPO for 
an unknown reason. ``I'm an adult and they're treating me as if I 
don't know what I'm doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ETrade's requirements include online investing experience and a  
minimum investment. A spokesman would not specify which 
requirements Red Hat's programmers did not meet.

<HEADLINE> Hastert Backs Right To Sue HMOs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trying to hold his fractured party together,  
House Speaker Dennis Hastert said today that he will bring an HMO 
bill to the floor that includes new rights to sue managed care 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the first time a Republican congressional leader has backed  
an expanded right to sue -- something Democrats have been insisting 
on since the managed care debate began more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert, R-Ill., promised a floor vote in September on a  
proposal being developed by Reps. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., and John 
Shadegg, R-Ariz. It will also include the right to take disputes to 
an independent panel, the right to choose doctors outside a network 
and easier access to gynecologists, obstetricians and 
pediatricians. 
</P>
<P>
	Most significantly, it will include new rights to sue -- the  
first time that GOP leaders have backed such a provision. ``HMOs 
can be taken to court and held accountable when patients are 
harmed,'' Hastert said, describing the provision. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the most important issues facing the Congress this year  
involves the health care delivery system,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The move comes a day after a group of some 20 Republicans, led  
by Rep. Charles Norwood, R-Ga., signed on with minority Democrats 
to back HMO legislation. GOP leaders had been trying to come up 
with a bill that could pass the House for weeks now, and they met 
until 2 a.m. today looking for a way to avoid losing a floor vote 
to the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said Coburn and Shadegg told Hastert that they would join  
with Norwood and other Republicans unless Republicans could come up 
with a strong alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's significant is the leadership of the House has for the  
first time recognized that the will of the majority supports giving 
people the right to sue their HMO,'' said John Hart, a spokesman 
for Coburn. 
</P>
<P>
	But there were few details of their provision available today,  
and aides said they needed the upcoming August recess to work them 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	The bipartisan bill, which was formally introduced today, would  
establish an outside review process for patients who believe they 
unfairly were denied care. Companies obeying an independent panel's 
ruling still could be sued in state courts, but would not be liable 
for punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	It also includes a variety of provisions to ease access for the  
insured to medical care in emergency rooms, from specialists in 
clinical trials and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill was embraced immediately Thursday by President Clinton  
and decried by insurance companies and businesses, who have lobbied 
against new rules for health maintenance organizations and other 
managed care plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans hold a narrow majority in the House, and they have  
been unable to craft a bill that could win majority support. Their 
task will be even tougher now that some Republicans have joined 
with Democrats, who have been pushing for stronger provisions than 
most in the GOP support. 
</P>
<P>
	The point man for Democrats during negotiations that led to  
Thursday's announcement, Rep. John Dingell of Michigan, said the 
legislation ``covers everyone. You can appeal if you are denied 
treatment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton called on Hastert to schedule a vote.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is time to do what this bipartisan coalition has done -- put  
the well-being of patients before politics and special interests,'' 
Clinton said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was put together by Norwood, who has shuttled between  
Republicans and Democrats in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need a law that will protect patients, not a bill that will  
protect politicians at the November ballot box,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Norwood, a dentist, is one of several Republicans who are health  
professionals and have been at odds with their party's leadership 
on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	As news of the deal spread, lobbyists for insurance companies  
and businesses mobilized against the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	``This legislation is built on the erroneous premise that trial  
lawyers are the sole guardians of medical care,'' said Karen 
Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health Plans, an 
HMO trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	Given their slim majority in the House, Republican leaders had  
been hoping to keep the HMO issue off the floor until they had 
worked out differences among the GOP rank-and-file. 
</P>
<P>
	The bipartisan agreement is a setback for that strategy, and the  
leadership will come under increased pressure to allow the issue to 
the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican-controlled Senate passed HMO legislation earlier  
this year that is significantly more restrictive than Democrats and 
the White House favors. It covers only some of the nation's 
insured, for example, and does not permit HMOs to be sued for 
denying care. 
</P>
<P>
	Dingell, Norwood and others stressed that their measure would  
cover all those who have insurance.

<HEADLINE> Development Planned Near Canyon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK, Ariz. (AP) -- Federal officials were  
poised to announce plans to allow developers to build new housing, 
hotels, restaurants and other facilities on prime national forest 
land just south of the Grand Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Forest Service today was to announce which development  
plan would receive its endorsement. Some predicted the agency would 
select a $330 million project covering more than 250 acres. It is 
the more ambitious of two final proposals, and it has the support 
of several environmental groups, American Indian tribes and various 
state agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years ago, officials started looking to relocate employee  
housing and other services outside Grand Canyon National Park -- at 
peak times, many of the 3,500 residents were crammed into old, 
broken down trailers and tents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some aspects of our housing are absolutely deplorable,'' said  
park Superintendent Robert Arnberger. ``But I don't have a budget 
that's set aside to construct houses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The project, called Canyon Forest Village, would be built with  
private money and would include 1,200 hotel rooms and 250,000 
square feet of commercial space, along with a cultural center where 
American Indians could sell crafts. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents include officials in the neighboring cities of  
Flagstaff and Williams, where many tourists stay when visiting the 
national park. 
</P>
<P>
	Some, including Williams Mayor Jim Hooffman and local lodge  
owner Chris Thurston, have threatened lawsuits to stop the project. 
</P>
<P>
	Developer Tom De Paolo and his investors wooed local  
environmental groups and tribes into supporting Canyon Forest 
Village by promising to transport Colorado River water by train and 
pipeline from Arizona's western border instead of depleting ground 
wells in the park. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've never been approached by anybody before for our input on  
a development project,'' said Wayne Taylor Jr., chairman of the 
Hopi Tribe.

<HEADLINE>  Deutsche Telekom To Buy One2One </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Deutsche Telekom is buying the British mobile  
phone business One2One for $11 billion, trying to get back on track 
in its transformation from former state monopoly to global 
communications company. 
</P>
<P>
	Telekom, no longer protected from competition on its home turf  
in Germany, unsuccessfully sought to merge with Telecom Italia 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only did the bid fail, but the solo attempt soured Telekom's  
ties with partner France Telecom, which declared their relationship 
over. 
</P>
<P>
	And now, France Telecom is trying to push Telekom out of their  
Global One alliance with Sprint Corp. and an Italian joint venture 
called Wind. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts praised the One2One deal announced Friday, but only as  
a first step toward competing in an increasingly global market 
dominated by Internet and wireless communications. About 95 percent 
of Telekom's annual sales still come from the German market. 
</P>
<P>
	One2One, the smallest of Britain's four mobile phone companies,  
is jointly owned by Cable and Wireless PLC of London and MediaOne 
Group, the Colorado-based cable TV concern being acquired by AT&AMP;T. 
</P>
<P>
	``Strategically, the acquisition makes sense, as access to new  
customers is becoming more and more important,'' said Holger Grawe, 
an analyst at West LB Research in Duesseldorf. 
</P>
<P>
	But Grawe said it is still ``pivotal'' for Telekom to sort out  
its disagreements with companies in other European markets and 
increase its cooperation with Sprint. 
</P>
<P>
	Telekom boss Ron Sommer has expressed keen interest in the U.S.  
market, and Telekom's 10 percent holding in Sprint makes that 
company the most likely acquisition target, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Telekom, which is still partly state-owned, raised about $11  
billion in June through a stock offering. 
</P>
<P>
	Sommer, who had said the cash would be used to finance  
acquisitions and mergers, asserted that the One2One deal was an 
important move in a key European market. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are acquiring an attractive and well-managed mobile  
telephone operator with a strong brand name and considerable growth 
potential,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	One2One has 2.6 million subscribers in the United Kingdom.  
Telekom's T-Mobil subsidiary has 7.4 million customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition of One2One is expected to be completed by the  
end of September, pending approval by European Union regulators and 
Telekom's supervisory board. 
</P>
<P>
	Telekom expects T-Mobil and One2One to expand roaming  
capabilities for customers of both services and save money in such 
areas as technology and procurement. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Schatzschneider, analyst at BHF Bank in Frankfurt, said  
he saw only ``limited synergy effects'' from the One2One deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it will certainly improve Telekom's position for the  
upcoming bidding for the next generation UMTS mobile phone 
licenses,'' he said, referring to the new format called Universal 
Mobile Telecommunications Systems. 
</P>
<P>
	UMTS is expected to speed data communications and end the  
incompatibility between wireless systems in the United States and 
Europe. The first European bidding for UMTS licenses is expected 
next year.

<HEADLINE> Possible Motive for Ala. Shootings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIANA, Ala. (AP) -- In the first clue about a motive for the  
shooting deaths of three people at businesses in central Alabama, 
prosecutors say the gunman complained of rumors being spread about 
him moments before the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The district attorney gave a brief account of the killings at a  
court hearing Friday where the judge denied bond for Alan Eugene 
Miller. The case is expected to be presented to a grand jury on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm tired of your rumors about me,'' Miller was quoted as  
saying by prosecutor Robert Owens Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	The vague quote, which the prosecutor said was heard by a  
witness, was the first indication of a motive in Thursday's 
shootings in Pelham, a suburb of Birmingham. There was no further 
elaboration on what might have caused the violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller allegedly shot two employees at Ferguson Enterprises, a  
heating and air conditioning company where he drove a delivery 
truck, then drove five miles to Post Airgas Co., where he 
previously worked, and killed a third person. 
</P>
<P>
	His mother, Barbara Miller, said her son was laid off earlier  
this year by Post Airgas. 
</P>
<P>
	Clad in an orange jumpsuit, his arms and legs shackled, the  
heavyset Miller, 34, gave only ``yes'' and ``yes, sir'' responses 
to the court in Friday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller is charged in the shooting deaths of co-workers Lee  
Holdbrooks and Christopher Scott Yancy at Ferguson and the slaying 
of Terry Jarvis, 39, at Post Airgas. 
</P>
<P>
	The district attorney said Miller entered the unlocked Ferguson  
building with a gun Thursday morning and first met Holdbrooks. 
Holdbrooks, 32, was killed by multiple shots to the chest and one 
to the head, Owens said. He said Miller then went down a hall and 
shot Yancy, 28, before running out of the building. 
</P>
<P>
	Police charged Miller with one count of capital murder that  
encompasses the three killings. 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney appointed to represent Miller, Mickey Johnson,  
described Miller as ``confused'' when he spoke with him at the 
police department Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looked like a deer caught in the headlights,'' Johnson said  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Post Airgas and Ferguson Enterprise were closed Friday.  
People left flowers and wreaths outside the businesses.

<HEADLINE> Cincinnati Crash Kills 4 People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A tractor-trailer slammed into the rear of a  
van carrying a church youth group, killing four people and injuring 
12. The trucker faces criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Three girls and a man were killed in Thursday afternoon's crash,  
according to the Hamilton County coroner's office. The victims' 
names were not released immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	The four were passengers in the van, which was carrying 12  
children and four adults from Eternal Life Harvest Center church in 
Knoxville, Tenn. Ten other passengers and the driver were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Clayton Kuehn, of Cadiz, Ky., was driving the truck that  
triggered the multiple-vehicle, rush-hour crash on Interstate 275 
north of Cincinnati, authorities said. He pleaded innocent today to 
multiple counts of involuntary manslaughter and aggravated 
vehicular assault, and bond was set at $1 million.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Man on Flight Released Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A Turkish man taken off a Delta Air Lines flight  
to Istanbul and then detained for an expired visa was released and 
allowed to return home. Upon arrival today in Turkey, the man was 
briefly detained again. 
</P>
<P>
	Hakan Caglar, 35, left Atlanta on Thursday night on a flight to  
Turkey after an investigation produced no criminal charges, said 
agent Steve Peluso of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
	He arrived in Istanbul today, only to be detained again by  
authorities. Turkish officials gave no reason for holding the man. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey's Anatolia news agency said police later released Caglar  
after questioning him. He told police he was detained in Atlanta 
because his signature resembled that of an Arab terrorist, the 
semiofficial news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Caglar, 35, drew the suspicion of authorities Tuesday at the  
Valdosta airport after he retrieved his luggage from a U-Haul truck 
and paid cash for a one-way ticket to Istanbul, with a change of 
planes in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI said at the time they received a tip that Caglar was ``a  
potential threat to national security.'' All 217 passengers on the 
flight were taken off the plane for a security check and five 
seated near Caglar were questioned. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI spokeswoman Celestine Armstead refused to say what agents  
suspected he might have done. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not embarrassed at all,'' she said. ``We stand firmly  
behind what we did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Caglar, who had been in the United States since March 7, was  
detained until Thursday by the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service because his visa expired June 6.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Fall on Payroll Report / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bonds fell sharply Friday, reversing two days of  
gains, after an economic report fanned fears of an interest rate 
increase later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 1 5/8 point,  
or $16.25 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction, rose to 6.17 percent from 6.04 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	A report showing a stronger than expected increase in June  
payrolls heightened concerns that the Federal Reserve might raise 
rates at its next meeting on Aug. 24. Higher rates would hurt the 
value of bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported that businesses added more than  
300,000 jobs to their payrolls and increased wages by a 
larger-than-expected amount in July. Unemployment held steady at 
4.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were down between 9/32 point and 17/32 point, and intermediate 
maturities were off 3/4 point to 1 3/16 point, reported Bridge 
Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.78 percent as the  
discount rose 0.07 percentage point to 4.66 percent. Six-month 
yields were 5.03 percent, as the discount rose 0.10 percentage 
point to 4.84 percent. One-year yields were 5.12 percent as the 
discount rose by 0.10 percentage point from late Thursday to 4.87 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.88 percent from 5.06 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 1 1/8 point to 115 30/32. The average 
yield to maturity rose to 5.68 percent from 5.61 percent.

<HEADLINE> Bickle Misses Boat at Brickyard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- So very close, so very far.  
</P>
<P>
	Rich Bickle gambled his qualifying speed would be good enough to  
get into Saturday's Brickyard 400. He almost made it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the same car that we had for the test session, and all  
we did was just paint it,'' Bickle said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a problem with the chassis. We didn't know whther or  
not we were going to stand on our time, and we just decided to 
stand on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The top 25 qualifiers on Thursday were locked into position.  
Bickle was among the 30 others who completed qualification attempts 
and had the option of keeping their original speeds or withdrawing 
and trying again. 
</P>
<P>
	In the final round of qualifications on Friday, Ted Musgrave,  
Steve Park and Rick Mast re-qualified fast enough to gain spots in 
the 43-car lineup. Eight others, including three-time Winston Cup 
champion Darrell Waltrip -- who confirmed on Thursday he will retire 
after the 2000 season -- remained in the field with their 
first-round speeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Bickle was .024 second behind the slowest qualifier, Hut  
Stricklin. 
</P>
<P>
	That blink-of-the-eye difference cost Bickle at least $80,000,  
the minimum payoff in Saturday's $6.1 million race. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven others who failed to qualify, including two-time pole  
starter Ernie Irvan, were added as provisional starters based on 
owners' points. The others were Bobby Hamilton, Chad Little, Johnny 
Benson, Kenny Wallace, Jimmy Spencer and Kevin Lepage. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who failed to make the field were Brett Bodine, the  
Brickyard runner-up in 1994, and veterans Dick Trickle, Morgan 
Shepherd and Mike Wallace.

	 *FIRST NASCAR, NEXT F1:* Tony George broke more than 80 years of  
tradition when he brought NASCAR to the Indianapolis Motor 
Speedway. Next year, Formula One will invade Indy's sacred racing 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know a lot of people were skeptical and disappointed we  
chose to run another event here, but it's turned out to be a great 
event,'' the Speedway president said Friday before the final 
qualifications for Saturday's Brickyard 400. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we're starting to see the same thing about the Formula One  
race,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a lot of skeptics at first, but if success could be  
measured right now based on the level of interest in the event ... 
I think we have another Brickyard on our hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Formula One will make its debut at the Speedway with the U.S.  
Grand Prix on Sept. 24, 2000. It will be the first Formula One race 
in the United States since 1991 at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	George, who launched the Brickyard in 1994, is spending more  
than $70 million to build a Formula One road course that uses part 
of the historic 2 1/2-mile oval. 
</P>
<P>
	He also announced a three-year sponsorship renewal for the  
Brickyard with Pennzoil. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, this business is driven by sponsorship,'' George  
said. ``Pennzoil has been a player in motorsports for a number of 
years. We're happy to be on the renewal side of our agreements. We 
hope not only Pennzoil but all our sponsors feel like they get good 
value.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wouldn't talk about a possible reconciliation between the  
Indy Racing League, which he founded in 1996, and Championship Auto 
Racing Teams, the longtime open-wheel sanctioning body. 
</P>
<P>
	``This week I would like to focus on the event here. It's  
probably inappropriate to comment on that subject today,'' he said 
of IRL-CART talks.

lettering similar to the company's race tire and a prominent NASCAR 
logo on the sidewall. 
</P>
<P>
	``This new NASCAR tire cements our long-term alliance and builds  
upon the NASCAR automotive aftermarket goal of alinging with 
top-brand products,'' NASCAR president Bill France said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tires will be manufactured at Goodyear's facility in Union  
City, Tenn.

<HEADLINE> Atomic Museum Defends Bomb Earrings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIRTLAND AIR FORCE BASE, N.M. (AP) -- Souvenir earrings with tiny  
silver replicas of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki in 1945 are being sold at the National Atomic Museum, 
causing indignation in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the sort of thing you should be hanging from your  
ears or using to decorate your desk,'' said Naomi Kishimoto of the 
anti-nuclear group Gensuikyo in Hiroshima. ``It's unforgivable that 
(the) museum would sell through the Internet something that praises 
the unit that dropped the atomic bomb.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Gensuikyo found the earrings and other items,  
including medallions that commemorate the bombing missions over 
Japan, on the Web site of the museum, which is run by the U.S. 
Department of Energy at this Albuquerque air base. 
</P>
<P>
	The earrings are shaped like the ``Little Boy'' and ``Fat Man''  
atomic bombs developed during the war at Los Alamos, north of here, 
under the Manhattan Project. They sell for $20 a pair at the 
museum. 
</P>
<P>
	The bomb dubbed ``Little Boy'' was dropped on Hiroshima on Aug.  
6, 1945. Nagasaki was struck by Fat Man three days later. As many 
as 175,000 people were killed in the two attacks. The Japanese 
surrendered five days after the second bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	Museum director Jim Walther said Thursday the museum does not  
plan to stop selling the earrings. He said items sold in the museum 
store reflect history and present the work of dedicated scientists 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``This museum does not advocate war or the use of nuclear  
weapons,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Museum store manager Tony Sparks said the earrings are the most  
popular item in a store that offers a balanced view of the events. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're aware that it's sensitive,'' Sparks said. ``We have such  
a high contingency of Japanese visitors, most of whom are 
interested in hearing our side. We are careful not to glorify it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors on Thursday had a wide range of reactions.  
</P>
<P>
	Lois Dove of South Fork, Colo., said she didn't blame the  
Japanese for objecting to the earrings. ``It's not appropriate,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben Parks of Amarillo, Texas, said he understands the Japanese  
reaction but thinks the earrings should stay on the shelf, since 
the bombs ended the war. 
</P>
<P>
	``It goes back to a few people -- their military leaders. The  
population of Japan didn't have input into what was going on. There 
were innocent casualties and victims,'' Parks said.

<HEADLINE> AP Acquires UPI Broadcast Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Associated Press is buying contracts to  
provide news to more than 400 radio and television stations 
previously served by United Press International. UPI announced it 
is leaving the broadcast news business. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale is effective immediately, the news organizations said  
Friday. The price was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We welcome the opportunity to serve these broadcasters and  
their listeners and viewers with a range of AP's fast, accurate and 
reliable news services,'' said Louis D. Boccardi, AP's president 
and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	James R. Williams III, vice president and director of AP  
Broadcast Services, said UPI approached the AP about purchasing its 
broadcast customer agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	``This acquisition allows AP to strengthen its coverage of state  
news and expand its customer base,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	UPI President Arnaud de Borchgrave said shedding broadcast  
services was part of UPI's plan to focus on news products that will 
be delivered over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``What UPI is doing is transitioning out of the traditional  
conventional news agency business and positioning itself for the 
21st century,'' de Borchgrave said at a news conference in 
Washington, where UPI is based. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP serves 3,700 radio stations and more than 800 television  
outlets in the United States and reaches more radio listeners and 
television viewers than any other news source. The AP is the oldest 
and largest general news organization in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``AP's mandate is to provide news and information to our members  
and subscribers in all its forms, new media and traditional 
media,'' Boccardi said. ``We're a competitive full-service news 
company and we're going to stay that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of the more than 400 UPI subscribers who will be affected over  
the next 90 days, 346 radio stations and six television stations 
are new AP members. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of the changes at UPI, 47 radio news staffers around  
the country will lose their jobs, said de Borchgrave, who took over 
as UPI president and chief executive officer last year. He said UPI 
will concentrate on clients interested in specialized Internet 
newsletters and more in-depth investigative and analysis stories. 
De Borchgrave said 26 positions would be added to cover specialized 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
	UPI offices in Cleveland, Denver, Austin, Tex., Sacramento,  
Calif., Tallahassee, Fla., Albany, N.Y., and Springfield, Ill., 
will be shuttered and turned into ``virtual'' bureaus, with 
staffers operating out of their homes or other locations, de 
Borchgrave said. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP, a New York-based membership cooperative founded in 1848,  
entered the radio news business in 1941 with a separate wire 
specifically for broadcast use. 
</P>
<P>
	It launched the AP Radio Network in 1974, providing hourly  
newscasts, sportscasts and business programs. 
</P>
<P>
	AP's international television division was launched as APTV in  
1994 and renamed Associated Press Television News, APTN, in 1998 
after AP purchased the WTN video agency. AP also operates All News 
Radio, a digital 24-hour network. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP provides news, photos, graphics, audio, video and  
Internet services to more than 15,000 outlets around the world.

<HEADLINE> Tenn. Insurance Commissioner Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- State Insurance Commissioner Douglas  
Sizemore, whose agency has been criticized by some for not being 
more aggressive in its regulatory duties, submitted his resignation 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Don Sundquist accepted the resignation, which is effective  
Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Sizemore nor Sundquist could be reached for comment.  
Spokeswomen for both say the resignation is not related to the 
fraud case involving Martin Frankel, the Connecticut financier who 
disappeared in May and is suspected of stealing between $215 
million and $915 million from insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Sizemore was not in office in 1991 when Frankel tapped Franklin  
businessman John Hackney to run Thunor Trust, which bought small, 
struggling insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Those companies, in Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma  
and Tennessee, believed their policyholder money was being invested 
through Frankel's brokerage firm, but apparently no trades were 
ever made. Instead, prosecutors say Frankel stole the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Hackney has said he had no knowledge of Frankel's activities and  
considers himself a victim. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say Tennessee regulators should have uncovered the scam  
years ago. State auditors have seized the department's records in 
the case, and the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation is looking into 
the case.

	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Steelworkers employed by the U.S. Steel  
division of USX and Bethlehem Steel have approved new five-year 
contracts, the United Steelworkers of America announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
	The agreements include a $2-an-hour raise; pension improvements;  
a one-time lump sum payment to current retirees on Aug. 1, 2000, 
with additional annual lump-sum payments depending on the 
companies' profits; increased benefits; and lump-sum payments to 
surviving spouses of union members who died before retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiations marked the first time in 16 years that two  
steel companies jointly bargained with the union.

Lorenzen Wright reportedly agreed to join the Lakers, too, at a 
price far below his market value. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell Curry signed with Toronto, Calbert Cheaney turned down a  
trade to Miami and signed with Boston instead, Terry Porter signed 
with the NBA champion San Antonio Spurs, and John Wallace left 
Toronto to return to the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway got a seven-year, $86 million contract, the largest  
allowed under the league's collective bargaining agreement, and 
will team with Jason Kidd in a star-studded backcourt. 
</P>
<P>
	It was bitter day for the Magic, who parted with the last member  
of the 1995 team that went to the NBA Finals and got relatively 
little in return. 
</P>
<P>
	Suns coach Danny Ainge called Hardaway ``the most skilled  
all-around player in the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden, I really believe this puts us as one of the  
elite teams in the NBA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a major coup for the Suns, who had no room under the  
salary cap to go after free agents, let alone one the stature of 
Hardaway. 
</P>
<P>
	Suns president Jerry Colangelo said the acquisition ``ranks  
right up there with any acquisition we've ever made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Magic tried to work out a deal with the Lakers, Raptors and  
a few other teams, but all dropped out of the bidding by the middle 
of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have nothing against Orlando. I came to Phoenix and fell in  
love with Phoenix,'' Hardaway said. ``I thank the Magic for going 
through with the deal because they didn't have to. They saw the 
same thing I saw; it's time for me to just move on and start a new 
career. I wanted to do it here in Phoenix.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway's image as one of the NBA's rising superstars took a  
beating in recent years. He was accused of orchestrating the 
departure of coach Brian Hill, then sat out most of the 1997-98 
season, but still played in the All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
	He also had an uneven relationship with Magic coach Chuck Daly,  
who resigned after the 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway said he had said and done things in Orlando in recent  
years ``that were out of character for me'' and looked forward to a 
fresh start. 
</P>
<P>
	In other news:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Seattle apparently dropped out of the bidding for free agent  
Mitch Richmond and started scrambling to make other moves, even 
trying to acquire the much maligned Donyell Marshall from Golden 
State for Hersey Hawkins. That offer was turned down, and the 
Sonics also got no commitment from free agent forward Gary Trent 
after making another offer. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Miami emerged as the leading candidate to acquire Richmond,  
but needed to find a third team to broker a sign-and-trade deal 
with the Wizards. The Heat were not believed to be willing to part 
with P.J. Brown in a deal for Richmond, who still has a three-year, 
$30 million offer on the table from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Toronto increased its offer to Charles Oakley, offering him  
about $18 million for three years, while Oakley lowered his asking 
price to $24 million for three years. The Raptors and Lakers were 
discussing a sign-and-trade deal that would send the veteran power 
forward to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Fox signed a six-year deal with the Lakers believed to be  
worth $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Porter left the Heat and signed with the Spurs, saying he  
didn't want to commit to Miami because of all the uncertainty over 
what the roster will look like next season. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Shandon Anderson and Jazz remained apart in their contract  
negotiations, although Utah felt its chances of keeping the 
shooting guard had improved. 
</P>
<P>
	-- ESPN reported that Wright has decided to accept a one-year, $2  
million offer from the Lakers. He had been the subject of various 
sign-and-trade proposals that would have earned him millions of 
dollars more. 
</P>
<P>
	Curry got a three-year, $6 million contract. He led the NBA in  
3-point accuracy last season, shooting 47.6 percent, and will be 
teamed in Toronto with Dee Brown, who led the NBA with 135 
3-pointers and 349 3-point attempts last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting a player of great character,'' Toronto general  
manager Glen Grunwald said. ``He'll provide firepower off the 
bench, we're looking forward to having his veteran presence and his 
shooting ability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Celtics coach Rick Pitino didn't commit to inserting Cheaney in  
his starting lineup, but said the six-year veteran, who played 
forward and guard for the Wizards last season, would help fill the 
hole left by Mercer at shooting guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was time for a change,'' Cheaney said. ``The last  
two or three seasons were disappointing for me. It was time for a 
fresh start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The SuperSonics negotiated Thursday with free-agent guard Vernon  
Maxwell, but did not reach an agreement. Two sources, speaking on 
condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press that Seattle also 
offered Hawkins to the Warriors for Marshall. The Sonics also made 
an offer to Trent, who played for Dallas last season, that was not 
immediately accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	With Seattle, Golden State and Sacramento out of the Richmond  
sweepstakes, it appeared Miami was the only team left trying to 
make a sign-and-trade deal with Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still give it some hope, but all these deals are very hard  
to do,'' said Richmond's agent, Mike Sharpe. ``It's a tough 
situation, but we haven't stopped trying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Raptors increased their offer to Oakley by $500,000  
annually, but the sides remained $2 million apart per year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he had his way, he'd sign with Toronto and be traded to Los  
Angeles both for the desirable location and the team's closeness to 
being able to compete for a championship,'' said Oakley's agent, 
Charles Grantham. ``But he still has no problem staying in 
Toronto.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace, who was traded from New York to Toronto nearly two  
years ago, returned to the Knicks as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Watching them on TV in the finals I hoped they would win, but  
I wished I was there at the same time,'' said Wallace, who signed 
under the $2 million middle-class exception.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Dolphin Betters Arrested for Pot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITEFISH, Mont. (AP) -- Former Miami Dolphins all-pro defensive  
lineman Doug Betters was among 14 people cited for misdemeanor drug 
offenses during the Willie Nelson concert at The Big Mountain, 
authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Northwest Montana Drug Task Force took only two of those  
charged to jail, for resisting arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest were given tickets for possession of dangerous drugs  
and drug paraphernalia. Officers seized evidence and allowed those 
receiving the 43 citations to stay for Wednesday's concert. 
</P>
<P>
	Betters, of Whitefish, was ticketed for misdemeanor possession  
of drugs and drug paraphernalia. Authorities said marijuana and a 
pot pipe were confiscated. Betters has pleaded innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	A private security worker, checking people entering the concert  
for alcoholic beverages, glass containers or cameras, alerted a 
deputy to what was found in Betters' backpack. 
</P>
<P>
	The other tickets were written during the concert by the  
plainclothes drug task force officers circulating through the 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	In February 1998, Betters was paralyzed in a skiing accident on  
an expert slope at The Big Mountain and has been confined to a 
wheelchair since. He played in two Super Bowls and was the NFL 
defensive player of the year in 1983. He won all-pro honors five 
times before retiring in 1988.

<HEADLINE> Congress Backs GOP's $792B Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Now that Republicans have pushed their $792  
billion tax cut through Congress, GOP leaders intend to fan out 
around the country during this month's legislative break to whip up 
public support for the package. 
</P>
<P>
	But with President Clinton sure to veto the bill in September,  
many moderate Democrats and Republicans say it would be better to 
figure out how to devise a smaller compromise tax cut with a chance 
at becoming law. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, we can come back and do it one more time in a  
better fashion,'' said Sen. John Breaux, D-La. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the veto threat, Republicans won an important victory  
for a bedrock political issue with what would be the largest tax 
cut since President Reagan's in 1981. The Senate approved the bill 
Thursday narrowly, 50-49, after it cleared the House 221-206. Both 
the House and Senate adjourned until Sept. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	``Individuals and families are due a refund, and that is exactly  
what we do with this legislation,'' said Sen. William Roth, R-Del., 
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. ``Government is not 
automatically entitled to the surplus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With little chance of becoming law, the bill will serve mainly  
as a defining issue between Republicans and Democrats in the 2000 
struggle for control of Congress and the race for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a dramatic difference between Democrats and  
Republicans in this capital city, and this is the dividing line,'' 
said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and 
Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders will not send the bill to Clinton immediately so  
that the president can't veto it while they are away for the August 
recess. But Clinton said Thursday night that no matter when the 
bill arrives at the White House, ``I will have no choice but to 
veto it immediately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It threatens Social Security and Medicare, makes it harder to  
pay off the debt and imperils the prosperity that has brought real 
benefits to American families,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would trim the bottom 15 percent income tax rate to 14  
percent in 2003 and reduce the other rates by 1 percentage point in 
2005. Relief from the ``marriage penalty'' that affects millions of 
two-income couples would begin in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The estate tax would be repealed gradually starting in 2003, and  
capital gains taxes would be cut from 20 percent to 18 percent for 
most investors retroactive to Jan. 1, 1999. There are breaks for 
education and health care, expanded IRAs and pensions and a legion 
of breaks for businesses large and small. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats portrayed the package as primarily favoring the  
wealthy and business and conservative groups. They said it unwisely 
uses a third of the next decade's projected $2.9 trillion budget 
surplus for tax cuts at the expense of safeguarding Social Security 
and Medicare, repaying the national debt and preventing deep cuts 
in government spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is radical, it is risky, and it is reckless,'' said Sen.  
Kent Conrad, D-N.D. 
</P>
<P>
	Most polls show the public considers cutting taxes a lower  
priority than ensuring that there is enough Social Security money 
to handle baby boomer retirements. Nearly half the public thinks 
wealthy people would benefit most from the tax cuts, according to 
an ABC News poll of 1,012 adults taken July 28-Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	That poll, which had a margin of error of plus or minus 3  
percentage points, indicated that about a fourth of the people 
thought the cuts would benefit everyone equally, while 14 percent 
said it would benefit middle-income people most, and 6 percent said 
the poor would benefit most. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said such polls only demonstrate that they are  
acting on principle by returning some of the surplus in the form of 
tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know it may not be the single most popular thing, but it's  
the right thing to do,'' said Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, however, claimed that the motive for the tax cuts was  
the GOP's desire to curry the favor of business and conservative 
political supporters. ``A wish list so that every contributor ... 
will get a promise,'' Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., called it. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation was crammed with dozens of items sought by  
business lobbyists that total $60 billion over 10 years, according 
to Democrats. Some examples: 
</P>
<P>
	--Business and restaurant lobbyists would gain an increase in the  
deduction for business meals from 50 percent to 60 percent, costing 
$3.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	--For Silicon Valley firms and other manufacturers, would get a  
five-year extension of the research and development tax credit, 
worth $13.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	--For chicken farmers, a new credit for electricity produced from  
poultry waste, along with a four-year extension of biomass and wind 
electricity credits, about $534 million. 
</P>
<P>
	All Democratic senators and four Republicans voted no: Arlen  
Specter of Pennsylvania, George Voinovich of Ohio and Olympia Snowe 
and Susan Collins, both of Maine. The lone absent senator was 
Republican Mike Crapo of Idaho, who was attending his daughter's 
wedding but supported the tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Five Democrats supported the measure in the House and four  
Republicans voted against.

<HEADLINE> Like Magic, Two Heavyweights Float </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- Shannon Briggs and Francois Botha  
added a dash of magic to the pre-fight promotion for their 
showdown. 
</P>
<P>
	But they had help.  
</P>
<P>
	Melinda, ``the first lady of magic,'' appeared to levitate the  
two Friday in a bizarre publicity stunt aimed at drumming up 
interest in the 10-round non-title fight Saturday at Trump Taj 
Mahal. 
</P>
<P>
	While Boardwalk tourists looked on curiously, Melinda drew back  
a curtain to reveal herself standing while she held the 230-pound 
Briggs in the palm of one hand and the 232-pound Botha in the palm 
of the other. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing appeared to be supporting either fighter except  
Melinda's hands, and a pillow in each palm. 
</P>
<P>
	Botha, 30, of Newport Beach, Calif., may need some magic of his  
own once the bell rings. Oddsmakers have installed him as a 3-1 
underdog to Briggs, 27, the hard-hitting heavyweight with the 
bleached-blonde dreadlocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The odds didn't faze Botha, though.  
</P>
<P>
	``I get that all the time,'' he said. ``I even look at tapes of  
myself and think, `I can beat that guy, easy.' Whenever I start 
sparring, the guys fight with each other to get in the ring first. 
But once we start to spar, everything changes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Briggs, too, is looking to change.  
</P>
<P>
	Long heralded as one of the heavyweight division's promising  
young newcomers, he has yet to establish himself as a force. He won 
a controversial decision over lumbering former champion George 
Foreman in 1997, but he lost to WBC champion Lennox Lewis last year 
and has fought only once since, stopping unknown Marcus Rhode in 
the first round last Dec. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	``When is all this potential going to become reality?'' said his  
own trainer, Emmanuel Steward.

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs Anti-Cybersquatting Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate passed a bill Thursday night that  
would limit ``cybersquatting,'' a practice in which people register 
Internet domain names so they can later sell them. 
</P>
<P>
	The unanimous voice vote sent the bill to the House.  
</P>
<P>
	Domain names are the addresses computer users enter to access a  
particular Web site. They are sandwiched between ``www.'' and 
``.com,'' ``.net'' or ``.org.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some people have found a lucrative practice in registering Web  
addresses using the trademarks of famous companies in hopes of 
later forcing the companies to pay sizable amounts of money to buy 
the rights to the Internet locations. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would allow trademark owners to recover statutory  
damages in cases where it is proven that a trademarked name was 
registered in bad faith by a person who intended to unfairly profit 
from its sale. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure also would allow trademark owners to seek the  
forfeiture, cancelation or transfer of an infringing domain name 
after satisfying the court that it has tried but was unable to 
locate the person who registered it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration opposes the measure, contending that  
courts are already capable of dealing with the situation and that 
``it would be better to allow courts to continue to develop a body 
of case law in this area.''

<HEADLINE> Execs Say Business Outlook Is Good </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Executives from the manufacturing and  
construction industries are optimistic about growth in upcoming 
months despite rising interest rates, Dun &AMP; Bradstreet reported in 
separate surveys released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	For construction, predictions for prosperity dipped a little  
from last month but remained healthy; manufacturers were planning 
for stronger exports and a rise in production costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturing executives in July grew more enthusiastic about  
the outlook for production and new orders through October, 
accelerating a trend of the last two months, according to Dun &AMP; 
Bradstreet's monthly survey. Yet, the expected rise in production 
costs could eat into profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``With unit costs going up and with little ability to increase  
selling prices, profit margins in manufacturing are going to be 
squeezed,'' said David T. Kresge, Dun &AMP; Bradstreet's chief 
economist. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also said improvements in export markets and production  
expansion should help maintain profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good news for the general economy is that there is no  
indication of further tightening in labor markets or heating up of 
inflation,'' Kresge said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate survey of construction executives, the private  
business information business reported that despite the increase in 
mortgage rates, expectations remained high for continued strong 
growth in construction market. 
</P>
<P>
	Expectation levels were lower in July than in the previous two  
months and from a year ago, the survey said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The construction industry continues to report extremely strong  
demand,'' Kresge said. ``Just working off the orders that are 
already on the books, virtually guarantees an outstanding year for 
the construction industry.''

<HEADLINE> NASCAR Tries To Take Over Brickyard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- At the corner house on 28th Street, the roar  
of engines can be heard as cars zip around Indianapolis Motor 
Speedway. It is not the high-pitched wail that penetrates the 
neighborhood in May, but a deep, raspy whine that carries a message 
of change. 
</P>
<P>
	The old Brickyard is rounding up stock-car converts at an  
astounding pace, from Indiana's favorite racing sons to the folks 
who live a stone's throw from the speedway. Indy, the mecca of 
open-wheel racing, becomes NASCAR country every summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years after the good ol' boys first fired up their noisy  
engines here in 1994, the Brickyard 400 has done more than find a 
niche in the camelot of racing. These guys look like they're taking 
over the place. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody wants to be where the action is, and the biggest  
action is in NASCAR,'' said John Andretti, whose family name has 
been synonymous with Indianapolis for decades. ``That's probably 
the biggest reason why you see us come down here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brickyard 400 is still second to the Daytona 500 on NASCAR's  
list of prestige and winnings; the purse for Saturday's race will 
be $6.1 million, compared with $7.3 million at Daytona earlier this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	But the race attracts so many fans, merchandise sales and  
interest that it is making a strong bid to unseat the Indy 500 as 
the biggest race in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	``How can you guys have any doubt in your mind that this is the  
biggest race in our minds right now?'' asked Tony Stewart, another 
Indiana native who has fled the fractured world of American 
open-wheel racing for the riches and recognition of NASCAR's 
Winston Cup series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know ever since I was born, I can remember coming to the  
Speedway,'' Stewart said. ``And you always dreamed that someday you 
could be the first one to the checkered flag here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Stewart and Andretti, Jeff Gordon and Kenny Irwin dreamed  
about racing at Indy during the time they spent in Indiana. All of 
them are here in gaudy stock cars instead of the sleek open-wheel 
machines they were trained to drive as they rose through Indiana's 
racing ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	And they understand the explosiveness of the issue concerning  
who rules the Brickyard after American open-wheel racing split into 
two divisions -- CART and the Indy Racing League. 
</P>
<P>
	All but the outspoken Andretti were silent when asked about how  
Indy and racing have changed since NASCAR showed up here in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nope,'' Gordon said with a smile when asked if he'd like to  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The media and race fans around here are not nearly as guarded.  
</P>
<P>
	``NASCAR's more fan friendly,'' said Lisa Scott, sitting on her  
sister's lawn across the street from the speedway. ``The 500, 
they've just become too big for their britches, if you ask me. They 
cater to the richest people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joyce Scott, who has lived on 28th Street in sight of the  
speedway for 16 years, said, ``I'd rather go to the Brickyard than 
the 500.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stock car racing gets strong TV ratings in Indy, too. The  
Indianapolis market was third in ratings for the 1999 Daytona 500 
and first for Winston Cup's Atlanta race. It was first for the last 
two Brickyard 400s, and consistently pulls top five ratings for 
Winston Cup races. 
</P>
<P>
	NASCAR memorabilia sales, known for their relentless strength,  
have taken over the streets around the speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you see Dale Earnhardt bring in eight transporters with  
his clothing and memorabilia, that's pretty big,'' said Fred 
Nation, the speedway's vice president for corporate communications. 
</P>
<P>
	All this led the Indianapolis Star to proclaim this week that  
the Brickyard 400 ``has shoved the Indianapolis 500 into secondary 
status.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nation disputes this, pointing out that the Indy 500 still draws  
a bigger crowd, better local TV ratings and far more international 
interest than the Brickyard. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Indy 500 is an event that lasts more than two weeks,''  
Nation said. ``The Brickyard 400 is a three-day event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the extent of NASCAR's success in the heartland was never  
more evident than on Friday morning, when the four Winston Cup 
drivers with Indiana ties gathered in one room to trade quips and 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd say even winning a go-cart race here would be the biggest  
thing,'' said Irwin, a Winston Cup rookie and Indianapolis native. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to name their favorite Indiana tracks and race cars, none  
of the drivers came up with what used to be the obvious answer -- 
Indy-cars at Indy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stock car, Indianapolis,'' Gordon said. ``I thought that was  
an easy question.''

<HEADLINE> Hubbell Speaks on Whitewater to ABA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Kenneth Starr's Whitewater inquiry was more an  
investigation ``looking for a crime'' than an effort to solve any 
wrongdoing, presidential friend Webster Hubbell told a lawyers' 
convention Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I may be the only person who's flown on both Air Force One and  
Con Air,'' the federal government's inmate air shuttle, Hubbell 
said at the American Bar Association's annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell, once the No. 3 official in the Justice Department,  
served 16 months in prison for bilking his former Arkansas law firm 
and its clients. After further investigation by Independent Counsel 
Starr, Hubbell pleaded guilty in June to a felony charge of 
concealing legal work on a fraudulent Arkansas land project and 
also to a misdemeanor tax charge. 
</P>
<P>
	He was sentenced to probation on those pleas. His plea to the  
tax charge would be wiped out if Starr fails to persuade the 
Supreme Court to overturn a lower court's ruling on an immunity 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell told the lawyers that after he pleaded guilty to the  
first charge in 1994 and agreed to cooperate with Whitewater 
prosecutors, investigators wanted him ``to say something about 
wrongdoing on behalf of the president or first lady.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If I did not do so, that would not be considered  
cooperation,'' added Hubbell, who said he know of no such 
wrongdoing. ``My impression was that cooperation meant agreeing to, 
as they say in prison parlance, roll on somebody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very common practice, which came as a huge surprise  
to me,'' he added. ``A lot of the tactics that have been used 
happen every day. It's just a surprise to those who have no 
familiarity with the system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regarding Starr's investigation, he said, ``You get the  
impression that, opposed to ... investigating a crime, ... it was 
an investigation of individuals looking for a crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I would not have any candor left if I didn't think that part  
of what was going on was political as well as trying to get the 
truth,'' Hubbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell was quoted in The New Yorker magazine this week as  
saying Starr's investigators asked him about President and Mrs. 
Clinton's sex lives as well as his own. On Friday, he told 
reporters that prosecutors looking into White House lawyer Vince 
Foster's 1993 suicide ``were asking if there were anything between 
he and Hillary, and I said no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell said a main fear of a white-collar criminal in federal  
prison is of being held with high-security inmates while being 
transferred from one facility to another. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he once expressed concern about his safety to officials  
at a county jail, and they put him in a suicide watch cell apart 
from the other prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	When the other prisoners found out where he had been kept,  
``They said, `You must be one bad dude,''' Hubbell told the 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell's lawyer, John Nields, said, ``The criminal justice  
system feels very different when the perception is that your client 
has attracted attention because of who he is rather than what he 
has done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nields said he was glad to see the independent counsel law  
expire in June. 
</P>
<P>
	In the future, he said, ``We have way more to fear from too many  
investigations and too much criminal justice resources being thrown 
at investigations of high officials than we have from too little.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have somehow let our criminal justice system get into the  
hands of the press and the politicians,'' Nields said. ``They are 
warping the way it functions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell recently has been doing research and counseling people  
on their way to prison for the National Center for Institutions and 
Alternatives, a nonprofit group based in Alexandria, Va.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Shunned Foreign Currency Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. monetary authorities did not intervene in  
foreign currency markets in the April-June quarter despite the 
volatility of the Japanese yen and depreciation of the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve Bank of New York disclosed its  
nonintervention strategy in a report Thursday to the U.S. Congress. 
A copy was made available to reporters in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Fed acts as the agent for the U.S. Treasury and the  
entire Federal Reserve system in executing U.S. foreign exchange 
policy by buying and selling dollars in the open market. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time it intervened was on June 17, 1998, when the Fed  
sold $833 million U.S. dollars to support the then-foundering yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter R. Fisher, executive vice president of the New York Fed,  
told reporters that no intervention was needed in this year's 
second quarter because ``dollar exchange rates moved modestly and 
incrementally day to day,'' indicating no turmoil in the foreign 
currency markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The report noted that the dollar appreciated 4 percent against  
the euro, the currency in which 11 European countries participate, 
and was ``largely unchanged'' against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	During the April-June quarter, the yen depreciated to 124.32 to  
the dollar before strengthening following the Federal Reserve's May 
18 announcement that it was leaning toward an increase in rates. On 
June 30, the Fed raised its target for the key federal funds rate 
to 5 percent from 4.75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro ended the second quarter at $1.0338, but has since  
strengthened, closing Thursday in New York at $1.0749. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen, which ended the second quarter at 120.93 to the dollar,  
has strengthened to 114.30, raising fears that the yen's strength 
against the dollar will hurt Japanese exporters. 
</P>
<P>
	A stronger yen makes Japanese exports more expensive abroad and  
subsequently less competitive. It also reduces the 
dollar-denominated earnings of Japanese exporters when translated 
into yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Japan's finance minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, told  
parliament that the yen's recent rise against the dollar has been 
excessive. The ministry said Miyazawa had spoken with U.S. Treasury 
Secretary Lawrence Summers about foreign exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Treasury confirmed the conversation about ``recent  
developments in the exchange markets'' but gave no clue if the 
United States was prepared to intervene on behalf of the yen.

<HEADLINE> Pan American Games Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- The Pan American Games need to be  
shortened. That's the view of the president of the 1999 Games, who 
says he will suggest some changes at a debriefing session next 
month in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to recommend that the size of the games be reduced  
from 42 sports to 28 or 30,'' Don MacKenzie said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are way, way too many sports and way too many athletes.  
We reduced the events from 435 in Mar del Plata to 330 here. But 
the games should still be smaller. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we need to do is look at the Olympic program, eliminate  
the sports that aren't inherent to this hemisphere and with every 
one we remove, add a sport that people participate in the West. 
That will make the games shorter, more manageable and more 
affordable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	These Pan Am Games have been hailed as well-organized, even as  
the 18-day event seems to drag into the final weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll admit that a couple of days ago, I was dragging,''  
MacKenzie said. ``But that's my fault. Sure, these games could have 
been finished today or tomorrow,'' MacKenzie said. ``But I'm the 
one who wanted them spread over three weekends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 2003 games are slated for Santo Domingo, Dominican Rebublic.  
</P>
<P>
	USOC executive director Richard Schultz said he's heard people  
talking about shortening the games, but does not support 
eliminating sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a number of sports that are Pan Am only sports that  
would be really hurt by that, so we would hope that would not take 
place,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I do realize for the sake of the city, there has to be  
some control over the growth. What that would be I don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SON HONORED:* Mexican equestrian Gerardo Tazzer is competing at  
the Pan American Games with a heavy heart. A month ago, his 
12-year-old son was killed in a show jumping competition at Quebec 
City when the boy fell off his horse and the horse landed on top of 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	The 47-year-old Tazzer told colleagues he was competing in  
Winnipeg as a tribute to his son. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said his son loved riding, that riding is his family's life  
and if anything, he (the boy) would want him to compete,'' a 
colleague said. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *RING GIANT:* He comes at opponents like a crazed defensive end  
in football. Cuban super heavyweight boxer Alexis Rubalcaba has 
been a monster in his first three bouts. 
</P>
<P>
	All three of the 6-foot-8, 250-pound Rubalcaba's fights have  
been stopped as he beat his opponents either bloody or silly. His 
opponent in the gold medal match is American Davin King, who is 6-0 
and weights 208. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need a strategy,'' King said.  
</P>
<P>
	Canadian Patrice L'Heureux is no midget himself. He stands 6-5  
and weighs 252 pounds and had his nose bloodied and his eye 
blackened in his fight with Rubalcaba. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need to adjust your style, because he's like an animal in  
the ring,'' L'Heureux said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's vicious,'' Canadian coach Matt Mizerski said. ``A killer.  
He wants to kill everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WOOF WOOF:* It's hard to miss the Goodyear blimp as it passes  
over the different venues of the Pan Am Games. Even canines are 
taking notice and voicing their displeasure. 
</P>
<P>
	Dog owners throughout Winnipeg have reported barking fits from  
their best friends as the blimp makes it way around the city. It's 
not a new phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everywhere we go, dogs are just as curious as the people to  
look up and see what it is,'' said Eddie Ogden, a spokesman for 
Goodyear. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winnipeg dogs just aren't used to it, so maybe they feel the  
need to bark.''

<HEADLINE> Officer in Gender Case Transfers </HEADLINE>

<P>
	BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- An Air Force officer whose religious  
beliefs caused him to object to working with women in underground 
missile launch centers is getting a new job at another base. 
</P>
<P>
	But the lawyer for 1st Lt. Ryan Berry says the move doesn't  
resolve the dispute over whether his client was punished for his 
religious convictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue is, are they going to continue to have him  
stigmatized in a manner that will destroy his career?'' Henry 
Hamilton said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry, 26, who is stationed at Minot Air Force Base here,  
complained last month that he was being disciplined by higher-ups 
for what he says are his strong Roman Catholic beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
	He says those beliefs prevent him from being able to share such  
close quarters with a woman who is not his wife. He says it could 
lead to temptation or the appearance of sin. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry will become an acquisitions officer at Hanscom Air Force  
Base in Massachusetts after three weeks of training at a Texas 
base, beginning Aug. 23, said Ange Jaskiewicz, a Minot base 
spokeswoman. Acquisition officers procure materials for Air Force 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think he's going to be very successful in his new career  
track,'' Jaskiewicz said.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Olympics Wrongdoing Cited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Olympic documents point toward possible  
scholarship and travel abuses during Atlanta's bid for the 1996 
Summer Games, The Associated Press learned Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources familiar with a congressional committee's investigation  
of the city's bid said the documents contained ``several references 
to scholarships'' for relatives of International Olympic Committee 
members and non-Olympic travel for some members. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the sources, the documents mention gifts worth well  
over $1,000 that weren't previously acknowledged by the local 
organizers. The sources said many gifts involved corporations, and 
therefore did not turn up on the ledgers of the Georgia Amateur 
Athletic Foundation or the Atlanta Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	For months, Atlanta organizers said they may have bent some IOC  
regulations, but never took part in outright vote-buying on the 
scale that occurred in Salt Lake City. Organizers there gave cash, 
college scholarships and other gifts to IOC members and their 
families to win the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources, who would not give specific details of the Atlanta  
evidence, spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents are filled with possible violations not previously  
disclosed, one of the sources said. The sources said references to 
scholarships went well beyond previously disclosed memos from 
Atlanta Olympics chief Billy Payne, who said the memos contained 
ideas that never acted upon. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents are included in eight boxes that were not made  
public when Atlanta Olympic officials opened 6,500 boxes of records 
pertaining to their bid and organizing the games. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, Atlanta organizers filed a report to the House Commerce  
Committee outlining 38 violations of the IOC's $200 limit on gifts 
and some travel violations. On Thursday, the House committee, 
saying the report had not been ``totally accurate or complete,'' 
gave them a chance to revise it. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Attorney General Griffin Bell, a partner in the law firm  
representing the Olympic organizers, asked for the opportunity to 
change the report. A spokeswoman at Bell's office said he would not 
comment on the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources would not specify which colleges or IOC members were  
involved or how many offers were made. They also would not say 
where the IOC members apparently traveled to, saying only that most 
of the destinations were within the United States and apparently 
not Olympic-related. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Payne and former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young, who  
co-signed the original report to Congress as chairs of the GAAF, 
said they were withholding comment until ``a supplemental report 
was prepared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to speculate about documents we don't know  
whoever is talking about until the Commerce Committee has had a 
chance to review our response to their questions,'' Lee Echols 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee opened its investigation earlier this year after  
the Salt Lake scandal broke. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional investigators would not comment other than to say  
they were trying to clear up discrepancies in what they found and 
what was previously reported by Atlanta organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Commerce Committee Chair Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va.,  
said investigators were concerned about the accuracy of the first 
report after reviewing 38 boxes of documents. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents under review include eight boxes Atlanta officials  
are trying to keep private, arguing that GAAF -- which put on the 
bid -- was a private entity and not covered by the state Open 
Records Act. Another 6,500 boxes have been released to the public, 
but The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and state Attorney General 
Thurbert Baker have sued to see all the records. 
</P>
<P>
	A public hearing on possible corruption in the Olympic bidding  
process is expected to be held in September in Washington.

<HEADLINE> Game of Gunplay Leads to Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Two teen-agers believed they were simply  
proving who was the quicker draw: They thought the semiautomatic 
pistols that one boy pulled from under his father's bed were not 
loaded. 
</P>
<P>
	But both guns fired with an unexpected roar, killing one boy and  
leaving the other paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the paralyzed teen, 17-year-old Eduardo Rivera of South  
Milwaukee, is facing criminal charges, and a prosecutor says he has 
no intention of dropping the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time we focus on Mr. Rivera in his wheelchair, there's a  
woman in the back of the room whose son is dead,'' Milwaukee County 
Assistant District Attorney Steven Licata said Thursday. ``We don't 
want to forget about her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Licata said he will not ask that Rivera serve jail time or  
be tried as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel it's very important that Mr. Rivera be held  
accountable for what he did, even if he may not be incarcerated 
because of it,'' Licata said. 
</P>
<P>
	A preliminary hearing was scheduled to continue today. Rivera  
faces charges of reckless homicide and firearms possession in the 
death of 15-year-old Efrain Casas. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys had known each other just two weeks when they went to  
Casas's home after school on Jan. 5, according to police reports. 
</P>
<P>
	That night, they pulled the guns from an unlocked box under the  
bed of Casas's father. There were no clips in the guns, and Rivera 
later told police he pulled back the slide on his weapon to make 
sure it was unloaded. 
</P>
<P>
	Thinking the weapons were safe, the two agreed to see who could  
draw and cock the gun the fastest. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacquelyn Woods, who had recently started dating Casas, told  
police she was on the phone with him when she heard him say, 
``Eddie, are you ready?'' and then count ``One, two, three!'' 
</P>
<P>
	She then heard the blast of the guns, followed by silence.  
Minutes later, she heard Rivera's faint voice asking her to call 
911. Thinking the boys were joking, she hung up. 
</P>
<P>
	When Casas's father returned at 2 a.m. the next morning, he  
heard Rivera in a rear bedroom calling, ``Hello? Hello?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He found Rivera sprawled on the bed, unable to move and his son  
motionless on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	His son was shot in the left temple and died at a hospital the  
next day. A second bullet struck Rivera, paralyzing him from the 
neck down. Police arrested Rivera on Jan. 10 as he lay in the 
hospital bed. 
</P>
<P>
	Licata based his decision to prosecute, in part, on Rivera's  
prior conviction for stealing a 1987 Oldsmobile Cutlass for a joy 
ride. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera was given probation, but the judge said the boy could  
never again possess a firearm because the crime would have been a 
felony for an adult. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Mr. Rivera had listened to Judge (Thomas) Cooper, Mr.  
Rivera would be walking, his friend would be alive and we wouldn't 
be here,'' Licata said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robin Shellow, Rivera's attorney, did not return messages  
Thursday seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Teen Pot Conviction Haunts Pastor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.Y. (AP) -- His 11-year-old daughter, barely able to  
smile, sat watching as Steven Mullenix loaded up a rental van 
outside his old church in preparation for the journey north to 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Forget that he's the son of an American, that he can trace his  
Ohio roots back 200 years, that he's long dreamed of becoming a 
U.S. citizen. The Canadian-born clergyman's quest for immigration 
status remains agonizingly out of reach because of a marijuana 
conviction north of the border in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really upset about having to move out because, no matter  
what the United States has put me through, to me it's still home,'' 
Mullenix said Friday as parishioners hauled furniture out of the 
rectory. 
</P>
<P>
	Under U.S. immigration laws crafted to exclude Nazi war  
criminals, terrorists and other undesirable aliens, Mullenix, 36, 
is deemed ``excludable'' for life. Anyone arrested with more than 1 
ounce of banned drugs is viewed as a potential dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	His four-year quest for citizenship stumbled in June when he was  
stripped of his Assemblies of God ministry for one year for writing 
an abusive letter to immigration agents. 
</P>
<P>
	``So he made an error! Forgive and forget, that's what they  
teach in the Bible,'' said Larry Briggs, 63, a retired nursing 
administrator who was in Mullenix's 100-strong congregation in this 
village near Lake Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's like a man without a country, caught between a rock and a  
hard place. The whole thing smells political.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Losing his job with the ministry meant Mullenix had to leave the  
country with his wife and daughters, Esther, 2, and Hannah, who sat 
on the lawn with a neighborhood pal. ``I don't want to move -- I 
have a lot of friends here,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mullenix was caught with more than an ounce of marijuana at age  
18 and spent three months in jail. He kicked drugs at 22, turned 
his life around and had his conviction vacated there in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Only after moving his family to New York on a religious-worker  
visa in 1995 did he realize his predicament. He is suing in federal 
court to try to force a change in the immigration law. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody who knows me has forgiven me,'' he said. ``But the  
people who don't know me -- those that run the world -- I don't think 
they understand what forgiveness is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mullenix can trace his American lineage to 1671. Distant  
ancestors fought in the Revolutionary War, the Civil War and World 
War II. His grandmother still owns a 70-acre farm in Arcanum, Ohio, 
where their forebears settled two centuries ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1953, snapping up a low-priced agricultural nursery business,  
Mullenix's grandfather moved his wife and two teen-age sons to 
Mitchell, Ontario. The sons went on to marry Canadians but 
eventually migrated back. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Mullenix's father, Paul, never bothered to obtain  
citizenship for his three children, he raised them as Yankees. The 
family hoisted Old Glory, made friends among expatriates and ate 
western Ohio fare: hominy grits, biscuits and gravy, sassafras tea. 
</P>
<P>
	Because residency requirements were tightened in 1952, his  
father, who now lives in North Carolina, could not transfer 
citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
	In an angry letter to the U.S Immigration and Naturalization  
Service on June 7, Mullenix lashed out at immigration statutes that 
deny automatic citizenship to every child born abroad to an 
American.

<HEADLINE> Aetna Buys Prudential Healthcare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Aetna Inc. completed its purchase of Prudential  
Health Care on Friday to become the nation's largest health 
maintenance organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was consummated when New Jersey on Friday became the  
last state to approve the merger. As several states have done, New 
Jersey forced Aetna to meet several conditions, including promising 
to keep 90 percent of Prudential's doctors for the next three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Medical Association and physician groups nationwide  
argued the merger would create a monopoly in several cities, 
severely limiting health insurance choices for consumers and 
forcing doctors to accept lower fees. 
</P>
<P>
	The combination of Aetna and Prudential Health Care will provide  
benefits to about 22 million people nationwide. Aetna currently 
provides health insurance to about 16 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna, which has previously bought HMO companies U.S. Healthcare  
and NYLCare, becomes the nation's largest HMO with 9.7 million 
members, surpassing Kaiser Permanente's 8.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Justice Department approved the Aetna-Prudential Health  
Care merger in June. The agency required Aetna to shed some of its 
HMO operations in Houston and Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement late Friday, the AMA said the approval was  
expected, but it was pleased about some of the conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The AMA continues to be concerned that such consolidation  
further tips the balance of power to insurance companies, giving 
them too much leverage in their dealings with patients and 
physicians,'' the group said. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Aetna officials denied rumors circulated on an  
Internet chat site that it plans to buy Oxford Health Plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We note the rumors in the marketplace that Aetna is planning  
to purchase Oxford Health Plans. These rumors are not true,'' Aetna 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna said its focus is on integrating Prudential into its  
operations. Oxford officials refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Oxford, a large Northeastern health maintenance  
organization, had risen as much as 8 percent to $17.62 1/2 amid rumors 
of a potential merger, before slipping back to $16.50, up 25 cents, 
on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna's stock closed down $2.43 3/4 to $81.56 1/4 on the New York  
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Norwalk, Conn.-based Oxford is expected to become profitable  
this year after accounting problems led to millions in losses the 
past two years.

<HEADLINE> Will AWOL Rookie Play for Vikes? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANKATO, Minn. (AP) -- Minnesota Vikings coach Dennis Green might  
not have the welcome mat out for Dimitrius Underwood if the rookie 
defensive end 
</P>
<P>
	decides to return to training camp.  
</P>
<P>
	``Once a guy walks out, I don't think you'll find another player  
on this team that can count on the guy, regardless of what the 
situation was,'' said Green, who hadn't heard from Underwood since 
his mysterious departure Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood's agent said Thursday he still didn't know where the  
AWOL rookie is hiding out, but still believes his troubled client 
will eventually return to the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, a 6-foot-6, 276-pound defensive end from Michigan  
State and the 29th pick in the NFL draft, walked out of his dorm 
and caught a cab out of town Monday, just hours after his first 
workout with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	He apologetically called his Chicago-based agent, Craig Domann,  
24 hours later, saying he'd needed to tend to a family crisis and 
was on his way back to camp to meet with Green, who would decide 
whether to take him back. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, who signed a five-year, $5.3 million contract on  
Sunday, hadn't returned by Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The team, which was able to freeze all but about $27,000 of the  
approximately $543,000 after-taxes bonus wired to Underwood's bank 
account in Milwaukee, was contemplating its next move. That could 
be anything from cutting ties to keeping him on the roster in 
either active or reserve status. 
</P>
<P>
	Domann faxed The Associated Press a statement on Thursday that  
said all attempts to locate Underwood had been fruitless. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I join everyone involved in this matter in emphasizing  
that the verification of Dimitrius' safety and well-being is of 
utmost importance,'' Domann's statement said. ``Even though the 
specific reasons for his departure are not yet known, I can assure 
you that Dimitrius would never knowingly hurt his family, coaches 
and teammates by his unexcused absence. I remain hopeful that he is 
OK and I am confident that you will see Dimitrius in camp and ready 
to play soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Domann said his client was eager to play for the Vikings, among  
the favorites for the Super Bowl this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dimitrius' dream is to play in the NFL. ... He has been  
looking forward to playing for coach Green and he has been treated 
more than fairly by the entire Vikings organization,'' Domann said. 
``I ask that coach Green and the Vikings continue to be patient and 
understanding with my client until such point when more facts 
become available.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Domann also added that ``all speculation that Dimitrius intended  
to simply take the Vikings money and not play football is totally 
inaccurate and erroneous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Domann negotiated a five-year, $5.3 million deal for Underwood  
on Sunday, including a partially deferred $1,725,000 signing bonus. 
Before taxes, Underwood got half the bonus, or $862,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Green doesn't sound like a coach willing to forgive and forget  
if Underwood does return. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody has been here long enough to understand that  
only a certain type of player can play on this football team,'' 
Green said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the embarrassed Vikings might have the league's first  
first-round bust of 1999 on their hands, Green said Underwood 
didn't deserve special recognition because of his high draft 
status. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is whether a guy is making $3 million or  
$200,000, you have to count on each other as a football team,'' 
Green said.

</P>
<P>
	Tyrone Wheatley, dropped earlier this week by the Miami  
Dolphins, is now trying to make it with the Oakland Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
	Cut by the Dolphins on Tuesday, the running back was signed by  
Oakland on Wednesday and was trying out plays with the Raiders' 
offense on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is football, at any given moment you have to be ready for  
a move,'' said Wheatley, who was traded to Miami in the offseason 
after four often-contentious years with the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheatley starred at Michigan and was the 17th pick in the 1995  
NFL draft by the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheatley will be competing for playing time with Napoleon  
Kaufman and Rashaan Salaam. All three were selected within a span 
of five picks in the 1995 draft.

<P>
	Ron Powlus will get another shot at becoming a Detroit Lions  
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Notre Dame signal caller, released Wednesday when the  
Lions signed Donald Hollas, was called back to training camp 
Thursday night after Hollas left without a word to coach Bobby 
Ross. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never got to see him. He just said he's lost his desire,''  
Ross said of Hollas, a former Oakland quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	Ross said his reason for cutting Powlus was that he wanted the  
opportunity to look at another quarterback, and didn't want to keep 
five in camp.

</P>
<P>
	Tight end Ted Popson, who suffered head injuries twice last  
season, obeyed his doctor's orders and announced his retirement 
from the Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Popson, 32, played two years for the Chiefs after three with the  
San Francisco 49ers. He totaled 103 catches for 980 yards and eight 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Packers    	
</P>
<P>
	Green Bay's offensive line received a blow when backup guard Joe  
Andruzzi went down holding his right knee during a drill in 
training camp Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	He was scheduled for a magnetic resonance imaging exam today,  
but judging from the time Andruzzi spent on the turf and the care 
with which the trainers removed him on a motorized cart, the 
outlook isn't good. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, we don't have any conclusive information about the  
injury,'' coach Ray Rhodes said. 
</P>
<P>
                               *Jets    	
</P>
<P>
	The Jets' right cornerback slot was effectively decided Thursday  
when veteran Otis Smith broke his left collarbone during morning 
workouts. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10th-year player, who was being pushed by Ray Mickens for a  
starting role, will be sidelined for up to seven weeks after 
suffering the injury during a passing drill. Smith, 33, fell hard 
after getting tangled with wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bill Parcells said Smith will not need surgery. He might 	
not be available, however, until the season's fourth week, when the 
Jets travel to Denver for a rematch of the AFC championship game 
with the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Titans 	
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Steve McNair returned to practice with Tennessee on  
Thursday after back spasms sidelined him for a day. 
</P>
<P>
	McNair threw the ball during both practices, but coach Jeff  
Fisher said McNair still is feeling tightness in his back. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not as sharp, not as precise as it needs to be right  
now, so he needs to get back on the field,'' Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Cowboys    	
</P>
<P>
	Dallas Cowboys receiver James McKnight injured his left knee  
during an intrasquad scrimmage Thursday night and had to helped off 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Without being hit, McKnight went down during one of the first  
plays of a goal-line drill. The team listed the injury as a sprain. 
An MRI was pending. 
</P>
<P>
	``It probably doesn't look real good,'' coach Chan Gailey said.  
</P>
<P>
	Receiver Jeff Ogden also was shaken up during the scrimmage. He  
suffered a bruised left hip and did not return. His injury did not 
appear as serious as McKnight's.

<HEADLINE> Toyota Promises Faster Delivery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) -- Toyota Motor Co. says it has reduced  
the time it takes to deliver custom-equipped vehicles to about a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of waiting up to five weeks or longer, customers in the  
United States will receive their vehicles within 10 days of their 
order, said Ray Tanguay, vice president of Toyota Motor 
Manufacturing Canada Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The average car buyer waits 36 to 45 days from the time the  
order is placed at a dealership until the car is delivered, 
according to a study released Thursday by consulting firm AT 
Kearney and the University of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	The speedier delivery could give Toyota a significant  
competitive advantage in an industry where many customers now 
simply settle for what's in the dealer's showroom, instead of 
waiting for a car with their preferred specifications. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot program will begin in September on Camry Solara coupes  
built at Toyota's plant in Cambridge, Ontario, Tanguay said. 
</P>
<P>
	If successful, Japan's largest automaker will extend the program  
to the Corolla compact sedan, built on the same assembly line in 
Cambridge, and eventually to all models at all plants, including 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	To support the new initiative, Toyota said it had to make some  
changes in its supplier relations and logistics system, such as 
reconfiguring some containers for Solara parts, allowing more parts 
to fit in fewer trucks.

<HEADLINE> Factory Farms Rules Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Environmental Protection Agency proposed  
guidelines to states Friday on pollution control requirements for 
large factory farms to increase protection of lakes and streams 
from harmful runoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the rules, which are expected to be made final later this  
year, large hog farms and cattle feedlots will be required to get 
pollution permits from states similar to permits already required 
for industrial plants. 
</P>
<P>
	EPA officials characterized the new regulations as a significant  
step to curtail nitrogen and phosphorous releases into lakes, 
streams and other waterways from highly concentrated factory-like 
hog, cattle and poultry operations. 
</P>
<P>
	EPA Assistant Administrator J. Charles Fox said he expects the  
first general permits to be issued by states within a year and 
site-specific permits phased in over the next six years. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently fewer than 2,000 livestock operations are covered by  
state water pollution control permits. The new requirement would 
bring an additional 18,000 facilities, mostly large hog, poultry 
and dairy operations, under the permit system. 
</P>
<P>
	``These large facilities are generally significant contributors  
to water quality impairment,'' the EPA said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	But many environmentalists complained the EPA isn't going far  
enough to ensure that waterways nationwide are protected from 
pollution from factory farms. They want tougher uniform federal 
standards under the new permit program because they fear some 
states will not follow up with strong pollution control 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a tremendous amount of variability among the states,''  
said Robbin Marks of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an 
environmental advocacy group. ``We'd like to see some firm, 
measurable standards for pollution controls set across the 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marks and other environmentalists also complained that the  
Agriculture Department, traditionally an ally of agribusiness, is 
being given too much say in crafting the federal guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox dismisses such criticism and said that while the EPA will  
establish the basic guidelines and leave it for states to develop 
permits, the states will have an obligation to issue permits in a 
way that protects waterways. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they don't, they're subject to EPA oversight and potential  
citizen lawsuits,'' Fox said in an interview. ``There will be some 
differences among states, but ultimately all states will be 
implementing much more protective programs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA will take comments on the draft guidelines for 60 days,  
with final rules expected before the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollution from large cattle feedlots, hog farms and poultry  
farms have been of particular concern because of the large and 
concentrated amounts of manure they produce -- much of which is 
applied to farms causing nutrients to run off into nearby streams 
and other waterways. 
</P>
<P>
	These agricultural runoffs, which are rich in nutrients like  
nitrogen and phosphorous, deprive lakes and streams of oxygen 
essential to maintaining viable fisheries. They also have been 
linked to the growth of dangerous toxic microorganisms such as 
Pfiesteria that scientists believe has been responsible for major 
fish kills in the Chesapeake Bay area, the Carolinas and elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> Congress Eyes Religious Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress is getting religion this year, led by  
those seeking to save the nation's soul but resisted by others 
warning of constitutional perdition. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, the House has passed legislation aimed at  
muzzling government interference with religious freedom, has voted 
to let states display the Ten Commandments in public schools, and 
has set aside federal money so religious groups can help troubled 
teens. 
</P>
<P>
	The House also has urged, unsuccessfully, creation of a national  
day of prayer and fasting. 
</P>
<P>
	Awaiting consideration in the House and Senate are  
constitutional amendments on voluntary school prayer; proposals to 
extend school vouchers to parochial schools and ``charitable 
choice'' bills that would permit religious groups to participate in 
all federally funded social service programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of these issues appear regularly on the congressional  
agenda. But several factors have combined to place greater emphasis 
than usual this session on religious legislation: 
</P>
<P>
	--The school shootings in Colorado and elsewhere.  
</P>
<P>
	--GOP frustration with court rulings on state-church issues.  
</P>
<P>
	--Even President Clinton's affair with White House intern Monica  
Lewinsky, which Janet Parshall of the conservative Family Research 
Council said gave the nation ``a morals lesson for 14 months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What we are seeing now,'' she said, ``is a congressional  
awakening that our public is made up of people who are a holy and 
religious people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our nation is sick and hurting,'' Rep. Helen Chenoweth,  
R-Idaho, said last month in support of her national prayer day 
resolution. ``If there ever is a time when we need almighty God, it 
is now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From the opposite perspective, Barry Lynn of the Americans  
United for Separation of Church and State said it was ``a trend in 
the wrong direction because Congress shouldn't be meddling with 
religion. When government touches religion it tends to degrade it 
and trivialize it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Pat Robertson, president of the Christian Coalition,  
visited Senate GOP leaders and contended that pushing a religious 
and pro-family agenda would be crucial for a Republican victory in 
next year's elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the last election 15 percent of the religious conservatives  
did not vote because essentially they were turned off by Congress 
waffling on key issues,'' Robertson said in an interview with The 
Associated Press. ``This Congress is getting the message and I am 
very pleased.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., a liberal suspicious of attempts to  
infuse religion in government, cautioned that not all the 
legislation was the same. 
</P>
<P>
	He said measures such as that endorsing the Ten Commandments  
clearly are unconstitutional. ``They are obnoxious and they are 
done for political reasons,'' Nadler said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said there are serious if debatable arguments for  
charitable choice, an idea supported by Vice President Al Gore. As 
for the bill to stop government interference in religious 
practices, Nadler said it was ``absolutely necessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nadler said he voted against the religious liberty bill, which  
passed the House by a 306-118 margin, mainly because he wanted 
language ensuring religion would not be used to justify acts of 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Charitable choice advocates won a victory when it became a part  
of the 1996 welfare reform bill, which allows federal funding for 
religious groups delivering welfare services to the poor. Led by 
Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., supporters this year hope to open all 
social service grants to faith-based groups. 
</P>
<P>
	For Lynn, transfers of tax dollars to ministries raise  
``extremely serious church-state problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Chet Edwards, D-Texas, during the House debate on applying  
charitable choice to juvenile crime prevention programs, warned 
that in five years, Baptists, Jews, Hindus and Muslims all will be 
arguing ``over who got their proportional share of the almighty 
federal dollar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson and Parshall agreed that the next big objective for  
conservatives is a vote on a constitutional amendment to guarantee 
rights to religious expression on public property. The measure fell 
well short in a House vote last year, but the scandals and 
tragedies of the past year have changed perceptions, Parshall said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Supreme Court did a terrible thing to the moral fabric of  
this nation'' when it ruled against school prayer in 1962, 
Robertson said. ``This hostility toward religion has got to stop.''

<HEADLINE> SF Mayor's Race a Crowded Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The upcoming mayor's race features a  
crowded field, plenty of money and candidates who are anything but 
boring. 
</P>
<P>
	Dapper Willie Brown is running for reelection as an FBI  
corruption investigation swirls around his administration. His main 
opponents are ex-mayor Frank Jordan, who lost a reelection bid 
after taking a shower with two disc jockeys, and Clint Reilly, a 
wealthy political consultant who ran Jordan's failed campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The suave, dressed-to-the-nines mayor, who has been photographed  
wearing a crown, has been pasted with pies. He's been reviled by 
riders of the city's public transit system. The FBI is poking 
around the city's Housing Authority and Human Rights Commission, 
looking for evidence of irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
	After brashly promising to make the city's buses and trolleys  
run on time in his first 100 days in office, after almost four 
years the buses are still late. 
</P>
<P>
	The city continues to be one of the most expensive in the  
nation, with the middle class all but priced out of the housing 
market. It's a magnet for the homeless, bicycle riders and 
motorists are constantly at each others' throats, there's no place 
to park -- and a new stadium for the NFL's San Francisco 49ers is 
buried deep in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown's regime has seen spending and hiring both increase  
rapidly. In 1994-1995, the city budget was $2.65 billion. Brown, 
who took office in 1996, produced a budget for 1999-2000 of $4.15 
billion -- and called for the hiring of 1,400 additional municipal 
workers in a city of some 760,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Reilly, the son of a milkman, already has spent $1.3 million to  
oust Brown -- $273,041 more than he's raised -- and most of the total 
came out of his own pocket. 
</P>
<P>
	Political consultant Ellie Schafer of Schafer Campaigns said she  
expected Reilly and Brown each would spend about $4 million, while 
Jordan has pledged to stay inside the suggested -- but not legally 
required -- campaign spending limit of $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Reilly's had some problems that will be certain to come up  
again. He has a temper to go with a drunk driving rap, and a 
well-publicized brawl with San Francisco Examiner Executive Editor 
Phil Bronstein. Reilly ended up with a broken ankle -- and a 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, a former police chief, hurt himself near the end of his  
reelection campaign when a publicity stunt putting him half-nude in 
a shower with two radio DJs backfired. 
</P>
<P>
	Schafer said she thinks Reilly and Jordan are basically fighting  
for the same ``anti-Willie'' votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It puts them in a tough spot,'' she said Friday. ``There are  
only so many anti-Willie votes to go around.''

<HEADLINE> Motorola Sells Off Chip Supplier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- In an effort to concentrate on the high-tech side  
of the semiconductor industry, Motorola Inc. sold a leading 
supplier of chips for everything from phones to computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Pacific Group, based in Fort Worth and San Francisco,  
bought ON Semiconductor, the new company created from the split, 
for $1.6 billion. The division had $1.5 billion in sales last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced Thursday is the largest selloff in Motorola's  
history, though the Schaumburg, Ill., company will continue to own 
a 10 percent stake in the new company, said ON spokesman Randy 
Frank. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola spokesman Chuck Granieri said the split will allow the  
communications equipment maker to focus on its remaining 
semiconductor division, responsible for advanced technology, 
including complex circuits for engine control systems in 
automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope to grow that remaining portion of the business and  
become strong leaders in the high-tech systems industry,'' Granieri 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company produces low-cost, high-volume semiconductors  
rather than more advanced semiconductor products, said Frank 
Hanson, president of ON Semiconductor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are really the Home Depot of the electronic world,'' Hanson  
said. ``The nails, the glue and the light switches that are all 
necessary to make a system work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frank said Motorola and what is now ON Semiconductor began  
selloff discussions more than a year ago because of different 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at their kind of business, their semiconductors  
take a long design-time frame,'' Frank said. ``Our products can be 
designed reasonably quickly and designed into the system very 
quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Phoenix-based company manufactures 17,000 different  
components that provide power and interface for computers, cellular 
communications, automobiles and household appliances. It is a 
leading supplier of analog, logic and discrete semiconductor 
components. 
</P>
<P>
	On has 14,000 employees in 14 worldwide manufacturing  
facilities, including 2,700 in the Phoenix area. 
</P>
<P>
	By next year, ON Semiconductor will be operating a research and  
development center in Phoenix with plans to hire about 200 people, 
Frank said.

<HEADLINE> Top Trotting Trainer Faces Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Being suspended for a year on the eve of the Hambletonian isn't  
sitting well with trainer Jimmy Takter. 
</P>
<P>
	Just two years after sending Malabar Man to victory in the  
Hambletonian and a year after guiding Moni Maker to Horse of the 
Year honors, the highly respected Swede is heading into trotting's 
most prestigious race Saturday knowing it might be his last Hambo 
until 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Self Possessed is the overwhelming favorite to win the $1  
million race for 3-year-olds at the Meadowlands Racetrack in East 
Rutherford, N.J., but Takter's Enjoy Lavec is improving and 
considered the 9-2 third choice in the field of 10. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying just to worry about the race,'' Takter said in a  
telephone interview with The Associated Press on Friday. ``I want 
to make sure this is my main thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Saturday, Takter's main concern will be with the New  
Jersey Racing Commission. It suspended him for a year on Tuesday 
for having a ``prescription legend drug'' in the track's detention 
barn on July 16. He has gotten a stay of that ruling, which is 
allowing him to still work. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Takter, one of his grooms brought butazolidin paste  
-- an anti inflammatory given to horses after they race -- into the 
barn with Enjoy Lavec prior to the final of the $430,000 Beacon 
Course Trot. 
</P>
<P>
	During a search of the groom's equipment, the medication was  
discovered. Pre- and post-race testing showed that Enjoy Levac was 
not given bute. The colt finished ninth after a breaking stride at 
the start. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the 39-yer-old Takter says it was a mistake to bring  
the medication into the detention barn, a facility where horses are 
isolated prior to major races to make sure no one tampers with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are taking a small snowball and making a big deal out of  
it,'' Takter said. ``You are talking about a simple mistake one of 
my employees made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As head of the stable Takter is being held responsible. He  
doesn't mind that, but he also points out that the stewards 
normally impose a $500 fine if a horse tests positive for bute 
after a race. He said there is usually no suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting a year suspension is ludicrous, he said. The groom also  
was suspended for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Takter, who said he has an unblemished record in 17 years of  
training, said no trainer would even give a horse bute before a 
major race because he knows his horse will be tested. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like you drinking a bottle of scotch and you know you are  
going to take a breathalyzer,'' Takter said. ``Nobody is that 
stupid. We use bute after the race to make sure they (the horses) 
recover well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anyone in their right mind understands that, but  
unfortunately, the judges don't look at it like that,'' said the 
native of Mantorp, Sweden, who now lives in Allentown, N.J. 
``They're trying to destroy my reputation, which in some way they 
have done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Takter is even angry at the way the commission informed him of  
the suspension, which was announced on Tuesday. They telephoned him 
Saturday, two races before Enjoy Lavec was to race in his 
Hambletonian elimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Enjoy Lavec, who will be driven by Luc Ouellette, goes into the  
Hambletonian with two wins and two thirds in six starts this year. 
Last year, the son of Pine Chip earned $313,458, third best among 
2-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I have a serious contender,'' Takter said.  
</P>
<P>
	Whether it's his last for a while remains to be seen.  
</P>
<P>
	The field for the Hambletonian with horse, driver and odds:  
</P>
<P>
	CR Renegade, Rod Allen, 7-2; Cherry Hills, Dave Palone, 12-1; CR  
Commando, Carl Allen, 7-2; Self Possessed, Mike Lachance, 3-5; 
Comets Tail, Berndt Lindstedt, 15-1; Pearsall Hanover, Mickey 
McNichol, 15-1; Enjoy Lavec, Ouellette, 9-2; Davanti, Doug 
Ackerman, 20-1; Angus Hall, John Campbell, 3-5; Raffaello Ambrosio, 
Jack Moiseyev, 3-5.

<HEADLINE> Clippers' Piatkowski Re-Signs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Free-agent guard Eric Piatkowski opted to  
remain with the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday, signing a 
four-year, $12 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Piatkowski, 28, averaged 10.5 points and 2.9 rebounds last  
season, becoming the Clippers' career leader in 3-pointers made and 
attempted in his fifth season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy it's done,'' Piatkowski said by telephone from his  
home in Omaha, Neb. ``It just came down to comfort level. We know 
the area, we have a lot of friends in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``You look around the league, everyone can see there's no money  
out there. This is the best deal. I thought about it a lot, it was 
a hard decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As far as the Clippers are concerned, Piatkowski said, ``I  
believe the team will definitely be better. We were playing much 
better at the end of last season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-7 Piatkowski joined the Clippers in 1994 after  
playing at Nebraska. He averaged a career-high 11.3 points in 67 
games in the 1997-98 season, and has averaged 7.7 points and 2.2 
rebounds in his career, making 43.9 percent of his field goal 
attempts and 39 percent of his 3-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Piatkowski figures to share playing time at guard with Derek  
Anderson and Johnny Newman, acquired by the Clippers earlier this 
week from Cleveland for Lamond Murray. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that we've solidified that position,'' said Elgin  
Baylor, the Clippers' vice president of basketball operations. 
``We're delighted to have Eric back, he has played a valuable role 
for our team during the last five years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clippers lost Rodney Rogers and Darrick Martin to free  
agency without getting anything in return and also could lose 
Lorenzen Wright, who is reportedly close to signing a one-year, $2 
million contract with the Los Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no idea what he's going to do,'' Baylor said. ``I know  
we're still talking with him, it's not a dead issue as far as we're 
concerned. We would like to keep him.''

<HEADLINE> Nevada Fires Char 600,000 Acres </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Firefighters were brought in by the hundreds  
to fight wildfires that blackened more than 900 square miles of 
Nevada range, threatening ranches and historic buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of lightning strikes from storms Wednesday and  
Thursday sparked an estimated 80 fires across northern Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	The fires were estimated to have burned 600,000 acres by early  
today, an area nearly the size of Rhode Island. No injuries were 
reported and only one structure -- a storage shed -- was destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	An additional 1,700 firefighters were shipped in from around the  
country on Thursday, bringing the total by this morning to 2,500 
with more on the way. The battle was expected to extend into the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too early to say how long it will take. There are so many  
fires and we are spread so thin,'' JoLynn Worley, a spokeswoman for 
the Bureau of Land Management, said late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Extra help was especially needed in the north-central part of  
Nevada along Interstate 80, where fires threatened a housing 
subdivision near Battle Mountain and historic buildings in the old 
mining town of Unionville. 
</P>
<P>
	The lightning strikes ignited bumper crops of highly flammable  
cheat grass and sagebrush that have built up over five unusually 
wet winters in the high desert east. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, one of the worst blazes, Idaho's Mule Butte fire, had  
charred 92,500 acres and was 80 percent contained by late Thursday, 
while an estimated 230 firefighters still were working on a 
130-acre fire near Wisdom, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1,100-acre fire near Dailey Lake in the Paradise Valley south  
of Livingston, Mont., was contained Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, 80 firefighters were called in and more than  
10,000 gallons of retardant were dropped on the Lake Wenatchee 
complex of fires in the central part of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	In California, a brush fire blamed on arson threatened 100 to  
150 homes and spread across more than 250 acres of steep hills on 
the northern edge of Los Angeles before it was contained late 
Thursday. More than 450 firefighters were aided by helicopters 
dropping fire retardant. 
</P>
<P>
	The only structure that burned was a children's playhouse at the  
home of John Vergota. He pronounced the firefighters who saved his 
home ``terrific. These guys were really fast.''

<HEADLINE> IBM Finds Faster Recording Method </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers at IBM have discovered ways to  
record information dramatically faster to a computer's hard-drive 
or floppy disk, promising one day to make commonplace ultra-fast 
storage devices. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers, working at research laboratories in  
California's Silicon Valley and in Zurich, Switzerland, said their 
breakthrough, which involves applying a magnetic field in a 
specific way, also can improve the quality of the images or sound 
that storage devices produce. 
</P>
<P>
	The advance for the International Business Machines Corp. comes  
on the heels of its announcement earlier this year that it set a 
new computer hard-drive storage record by packing 20 billion bits 
of data into a square inch. 
</P>
<P>
	That achievement was twice its previous record and more than  
three times that of any disk-drive currently available. 
</P>
<P>
	Its application has several hurdles to overcome, meaning  
consumer devices using the new technology won't be available soon. 
</P>
<P>
	To boost the recording rates, researchers applied ultra-fast  
magnetic field impulses to thin films of cobalt to cause the 
magnetic poles of spinning particles to flip over more quickly -- a 
process representing a sequence of information. 
</P>
<P>
	The IBM work was reported in today's edition of the journal  
Science.

<HEADLINE> John Bobbitt Pursuing New Career </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y. (AP) -- John Wayne Bobbitt has heard a lot of  
laughs at his expense since he became a household name at the hands 
of his steak knife-wielding ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Keep laughing, he says. Only now he wants to get paid for it.  
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old ex-Marine is back home in New York to embark on  
a new career as a comedian. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he's trained with established Los Angeles comedians and  
has already survived open mike night at The Improv in Los Angeles. 
He's booked at a Toronto club next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a bad relationship and I think I can talk about that,  
have some advice,'' Bobbitt said in Tuesday's Buffalo News. ``Like 
sleep on your stomach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bobbitt's penis was reattached after it was sliced off in 1993  
by his wife, Lorena. She was found innocent by reason of insanity. 
</P>
<P>
	He later starred in a few adult movies but decided the business  
wasn't for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could just go home and get a job,'' he said. ``Or I could do  
stand-up comedy, and that's exciting, and wild and crazy, and have 
fun making people laugh. Make a career out of it.''

<HEADLINE> Indians' Lawyers Seek Funds Watchdog </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government cannot be trusted to  
fix decades-old mismanagement of about $500 million of American 
Indians' money without court oversight, lawyers for the Indians 
argued to a federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
	In court papers filed shortly before midnight Wednesday, the  
Indians' lawyers asked U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth to 
appoint an independent watchdog to make sure the government fixes 
problems with some 300,000 trust accounts. The Interior Department 
oversees the accounts, which mainly hold proceeds from oil 
drilling, mining, logging or grazing on reservation land owned by 
individual Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without judicial intervention, reform efforts will fail, since  
the (Interior) Department will ultimately lose focus and 
interest,'' the Indians' lawyers wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and other federal officials  
have strongly opposed appointing a court watchdog, known as a 
special master, to oversee efforts to fix the problems with the 
trust accounts. The department's Bureau of Indian Affairs is 
working on a computerized system to track the accounts, but Babbitt 
admitted this summer that the plans wouldn't fix all of the 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt and other officials acknowledge that for decades, many  
records regarding the trust accounts were never kept, collected 
haphazardly or eventually destroyed. Millions of dollars were 
invested improperly or not at all, and record-keeping is so lax 
that officials cannot say whether billions of dollars' worth of 
transactions were legitimate or not. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamberth held Babbitt, BIA head Kevin Gover and then-Treasury  
Secretary Robert Rubin in contempt of court earlier this year for 
repeatedly failing to hand over documents. 
</P>
<P>
	That contempt citation helped speed federal efforts to clean up  
the problems, said Keith Harper, one of the Indians' lawyers. 
Without continued court pressure, reform efforts would likely 
flounder, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You turn off the lights and all the roaches start coming out  
again,'' Harper said Thursday. ``It's difficult to get the 
Department of Interior to focus on this issue for an extended 
period of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Clark, the Justice Department lawyer heading the  
government's defense team, did not return repeated telephone calls 
seeking comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Five Indians sued the federal government in 1996 on behalf of  
all Indian account holders, seeking to force the government to 
clean up the problems and repay account holders for lost revenue. 
Lamberth split the trial into two parts: One dealing with solving 
the trust management systems and the other with determining how 
much the Indian account holders should be paid. 
</P>
<P>
	Final written arguments in the first phase were filed this week.  
The Indians plan to seek billions of dollars in the second phase.

<HEADLINE> Patriots Stadium Faces Obstacles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Foxboro Board of Health voted to allow  
residents of a trailer park to stay put on land where the New 
England Patriots want to build a new stadium, but the town's lawyer 
said the board doesn't have the authority to make that call. 
</P>
<P>
	And he said it wouldn't slow plans for the new $280 million  
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's invalid. I think it's beyond the scope of their  
authority,'' Town Counsel Richard Gelerman said Friday. ``This was 
just a distractive blip and not at all an issue anyone should be 
focusing on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gelerman said a meeting was held last week to address traffic  
concerns and residents would be asked at a town meeting this fall 
to approve various aspects of the stadium plan. 
</P>
<P>
	But Robert Kraus, lawyer for the mobile home residents, said  
boards of health have broad licensing authority over mobile home 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every year, every manufactured housing operation must be  
relicensed by the board of health, not just to make sure the water 
runs ... but to make sure they are following the law,'' Kraus said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kraus said the residents are not looking to hold up construction  
of a new stadium and are anxious to resolve their situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are discussions going on between the respective parties  
and we're looking to resolve it,'' he said. ``This is not about 
extortion, this is about protecting the lives of the people who 
live in this park.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State legislation authorizing $70 million in taxpayer money for  
stadium infrastructure gave team owner Robert Kraft options for 
dealing with the mobile home community. 
</P>
<P>
	It allowed him to buy out the homeowners, find them room  
elsewhere on his property or relocate them to another park within 
100 miles.

<HEADLINE> Gun Control Compromise Talks Opened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House and Senate lawmakers are re-opening gun  
control talks months after the chambers took starkly different 
approaches to juvenile violence in response to a spate of school 
shootings this year. 
</P>
<P>
	A committee of 34 House members and senators took two hours to  
give opening statements on the disagreement -- then adjourned, 
assigning aides to hammer out the differences while Congress goes 
on summer vacation this month. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton challenged the panel to stay in session  
through the month-long recess that begins next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's show our children that when it comes to their safety,  
Washington will not take a break,'' Clinton said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans on the conference committee quashed several  
Democratic efforts to keep the panel in session, and said that 
passions are running so high in the wake of school and other 
shootings this year that the talks will take more time. 
</P>
<P>
	``The substantive and political differences are very great  
here,'' conference chairman Orrin Hatch, a Republican senator from 
Utah, told the 34-member panel. ``This is not some itty bitty 
thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather do it right than do it in a hurry,'' House  
Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde of Illinois concurred. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats said doing the right thing means passing new gun  
restrictions before the new school year starts in a few weeks, a 
policy that many Republicans believe is unnecessary. Democrats said 
Congress could have new blood on its hands by waiting until the end 
of August recess to pass legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will have copycat shootings,'' said Rep. Carolyn McCarthy,  
D-N.Y., whose husband was shot to death during a rampage in Long 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
	They again accused Republicans of fighting new gun control on  
behalf of the gun lobby. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are those in both bodies who prefer no conference and no  
action,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, ranking Democrat on 
Hatch's Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-hour meeting was the first congressional action on gun  
control since the Senate passed new restrictions May 20 by one 
vote, and the House stripped that language from a companion bill on 
June 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the House voted to ask negotiators to write a  
compromise juvenile justice bill that would require background 
checks for all firearms sales at gun shows. Under current law, 
background checks are required only on sales by licensed dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution also called for including measures to prevent  
violence in schools and ensuring that the legislation does not 
weaken existing gun regulations.

<HEADLINE> Red Hat Inc. To Go Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After a year of extraordinary publicity for the  
upstart computer operating system known as Linux, investors finally 
get to vote on whether the touted program is a Microsoft killer, an 
over-hyped technology, or something in between. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Hat Inc. -- a fast-growing seller of Linux software -- is  
offering its shares to the public as early as next week in one of 
the year's most awaited initial public offerings. The deal, if it 
takes off as some analysts expect, could be the first in a string 
of IPOs from Linux companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet for all the anticipation, investor appetite could be curbed  
by the Herculean task facing the recent flurry of small companies 
focused on Linux: Gaining ground against the seemingly indomitable 
Microsoft Corp. and its ubiquitous Windows program, which runs 90 
percent of the world's desktop computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good test of what the market interest is (in Linux),''  
said analyst Amy Wohl, who owns her own industry consultancy in 
Narberth, Pa. ``Depending on how the IPO turns out, in the next 
month or two you're going to see more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Durham, N.C.-based Red Hat is selling 6 million shares, or  
about 9 percent of the company, to the public. If the stock prices 
at the high range of the company's expectation at about $12 a 
share, Red Hat would raise about $72 million, helping to boost 
spending on its Web site, marketing and other expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Linux (pronounced LINN-nucks), was created in the early 1990s by  
Linus Torvalds, a Finnish student, as an alternative system for 
running a computer's basic functions. Torvalds released his 
blueprints on the Internet so volunteer programmers around the 
world could contribute improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Linux can be downloaded for free off the Web or bought in  
packages with technical support for as little as $30. A growing 
minority of corporate technology workers are embracing Linux as an 
adjunct -- if not an alternative -- to the Unix and Windows NT 
computers at the hub of networks of business machines, and on 
computers that run Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Users praise the system's flexibility and propensity not to  
crash. But it often requires people to memorize and type in 
commands, similar to the DOS software that preceded Windows -- 
daunting to everyday users. And the number of Linux-compatible 
software applications, while growing, pales against the number of 
applications available for Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Linux, while fast gaining adherents, has yet to attain mass  
market success. Last year, sales of Linux comprised an impressive 
17 percent of all ``server'' software, used to run networked 
computers, according to the International Data Corp. research firm. 
But Linux software comprised only 1.8 percent of desktop machines. 
Those figures don't include free downloads off the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue is, Are organizations actually going to use Linux''  
as a major new business computer system, said William Peterson, an 
IDC analyst. ``And is there a market for Linux on the desktop?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Red Hat, by selling prepackaged software and technical support,  
offers an easier alternative to downloading the Linux operating 
system off the Internet, which could take a day or more using a 
conventional dial-up modem. Its distinctive packages -- emblazoned 
with a man donning a rakishly tilted red fedora -- are starting to 
pepper the desks of computer network technicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Hat says it is on the verge of turning a profit and that its  
IPO will enable it to embark on the next stage of its expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale takes place in less-than-ideal market conditions,  
however, with several Internet IPOs recently stumbling. But it also 
may occur the same week as the annual Linux World trade show, which 
starts Monday. Analysts say they wouldn't be surprised if strong 
demand pushed up the initial sale price, partly due to advance buzz 
generated. 
</P>
<P>
	Even at the current price range, the sale would give Red Hat a  
market value of about $800 million -- though its annual revenues 
were just $10.8 million last year -- lifting Red Hat to the sort of 
phenomenal valuation that investors have bestowed upon many newly 
public Internet companies. 
</P>
<P>
	If Red Hat's IPO succeeds, another Linux company, VA Linux  
Systems Inc., which makes business computers pre-loaded with Linux, 
is expected to soon follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Multimillion dollar investments in Red Hat and other Linux  
makers this past year by major technology companies such as chip 
giant Intel Corp. and IBM Corp. are lending credibility to Linux. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent initiatives are pushing it into new arenas as well.  
BuyPogo.Com, a Silicon Valley upstart, is selling $400 Linux 
desktop computers while TiVo, a Sunnyvale, Calif. company, is using 
Linux to run its new digital TV recording device. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, for all its market heft, could be hamstrung in  
counterattacking Linux because the software's license requirement 
flies in the face of Microsoft's strategy to jealously guard its 
software blueprints. Companies that license Linux are required to 
share any changes with others.

<HEADLINE> Ala. Executes Man for Rape, Slaying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- A man who beat, raped and suffocated an  
86-year-old woman on Christmas Eve was executed in the electric 
chair early Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Victor Kennedy, 37, spent 17 years on Alabama's death row after  
his conviction in the death of Annie Laura Orr in 1980. Prison 
officials said he thanked his supporters and apologized to Mrs. 
Orr's family before he was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Kennedy and co-defendant Darrell Grayson, both  
who had done odd jobs for Mrs. Orr, were looking for money when 
they entered her home in the early hours of Dec. 24. She was beaten 
and a gun was fired into the wall to intimidate her before she was 
raped. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Orr died after the men wrapped a pillowcase over her head.  
</P>
<P>
	Grayson, who was 19 at the time of the slaying, was also  
convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. His appeal is 
pending.

<HEADLINE> Refugee Dad Says All Needs Were Met </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The father of the first Albanian Kosovar refugee  
born in the United States has withdrawn his claim that the family 
was all but destitute because promises of aid hadn't come through. 
</P>
<P>
	Naim Karaliu, father of little Amerikan, whose birth this spring  
grabbed headlines nationwide, now acknowledges his family's needs 
had been met for now -- income, baby food, and rent for their 
two-bedroom apartment, The Dallas Morning News reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of food -- no problem,'' he told the newspaper  
through a translator at apartment he shares with his wife, baby and 
parents. ``The problem is, I don't know if I'm going to have enough 
money later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper, in today's editions, said Karaliu resented that  
other refugees seemed to be getting more aid than his family. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Post reported the family's pleas for support  
Monday. The next day, it reported that United Parcel Service was 
offering a job to Karaliu, who had complained of neglect by the 
Refugee Services of North Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	But the family acknowledged Thursday having had three household  
incomes when they made their complaints. Grandfather Vebi had 
qualified for $500 a month in Social Security benefits and got his 
first check last week. Grandmother Xhevrie got a job on a hotel 
housekeeping crew in June, and Naim had worked on a construction 
gang for much of the last six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The refugee agency had strongly denied the family's claims all  
along. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pretty frustrated with the misinformation that's been  
noted in the media,'' said Deborah DeWinter, associated director of 
Church World Services, which oversees the North Texas agency. 
``Frankly, we're pretty incredulous about the statements made that 
we have not provided rent when that's just not true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amerikan -- his name follows Albanian spelling -- was born May 6,  
the day after his parents were airlifted to Fort Dix, N.J., from 
the war-torn Balkans. He is an American citizen by virtue of his 
birth here. 
</P>
<P>
	Records show that the family has lived bill-free since arriving  
in Dallas on June 4, the newspaper said. They were given three 
months' rent on their $750 apartment, furniture, dishes, and 
hundreds of dollars in food and cash. They also were given 
referrals to social services and a job-placement program. 
</P>
<P>
	Within days of their arrival, the Karalius also began receiving  
more than $550 a month in food stamps and got full access to 
Medicaid and Medicare, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Nurse Donates $1.2M to Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Jean Akehurst was a starchy head nurse. But she  
had a soft spot for Johns Hopkins Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	When she died last fall at 79, she left the institution $1.2  
million -- one of its largest gifts from a line worker, said 
hospital treasurer Thomas Trzcinski. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think she showed much affection to anyone, and I don't  
think she showed it in nursing,'' said Anna Flatley, a nurse who 
knew Mrs. Akehurst for 58 years. ``She must have had a generous 
heart after all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ten other retired nurses have each donated amounts exceeding  
$250,000 to the hospital in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Akehurst graduated in 1943 and worked until fracturing her  
hip on duty in 1983. Her firefighter husband died in 1978, and in 
her final years, the chain-smoking Mrs. Akehurst, who was estranged 
from a sister, battled throat cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	She once confided to a hospital staffer the reason for her gift:  
``Hopkins is my family.''

<HEADLINE> Fusion's Serna Out for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Top Miami Fusion scorer Diego Serna  
will miss the rest of the season with a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Serna, who has 10 of the Fusion's 26 goals this season, tore the  
anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee Sunday against the 
Columbus Crew. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami is battling New England and Tampa Bay for the final two  
playoff spots in the Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Serna, 25, who is fourth in Major League Soccer in goals scored,  
set a team record with 11 last year when he was the Fusion's most 
valuable player. He will likely be replaced by Tony Kuhn in 
Saturday's game against the New York-New Jersey Metro Stars. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fusion expect Eric Wynalda to return from a knee injury in  
mid-September. Wynalda is the leading scorer in the history of the 
U.S. national team but hasn't played for the Fusion this season.

<HEADLINE> Nicaraguan Volcano Dumps Ash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MALPAISILLO, Nicaragua (AP) -- Covering their heads to protect  
themselves from falling ash, hundreds of people fled from towns 
near the Cerro Negro volcano as the government declared a state of 
maximum alert Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lava and ash spewed Thursday from three new openings in the  
volcano, 44 miles northwest of Managua in western Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials ordered evacuations along the volcano's  
slopes. Families fled their towns on ox carts carrying battered 
furniture, dogs and chickens. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going because we're scared,'' Leoncio Aburto said as he  
arrived at one of seven refugee centers set up in Malpaisillo, six 
miles from the volcano. ``The volcano made a horrible noise, and if 
it blows up, God help us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leading his cart, Aburto was followed by his wife and five small  
children, who covered their heads with sheets to protect against 
the rain of black ash. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,220 people left the area Thursday and another 500 on  
Friday, civil defense officials said. They were being taken to 
schools and health centers in Malpaisillo and two other nearby 
towns. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the people who live on the volcano's flanks are farmers  
who were reluctant to evacuate because they do not want to leave 
behind livestock and crops. 
</P>
<P>
	In the hamlet of Leche Cuajo, five miles from the peak of Cerro  
Negro, 274 evacuees living in a one-story school building rushed 
outside Friday after each of three earthquakes, the latest shocks 
since the volcano began spewing ash, gas and lava. Some of the 
quakes reached a magnitude of 4.4. 
</P>
<P>
	Cerro Negro has erupted twice this decade, in 1992 and 1995. The  
2,953-foot-high peak forms part of a chain of nearly 20 volcanoes, 
known as the Marrabios or Maribios, which crosses from southeastern 
Nicaragua to the northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	The government declared the maximum alert on the recommendation  
of the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies. The institute 
said more than 200 volcanic earthquakes have been recorded in the 
area in the last three days, the stronger ones sending residents 
running from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	President Arnoldo Aleman visited the region Thursday and named  
his vice president, Enrique Bolanos, head of an emergency 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We trust in God that a tragedy will not occur. But everything  
is ready to deal with any type of situation,'' Aleman said.

<HEADLINE> Injury Shelves Cowboys' McKnight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA FALLS, Texas (AP) -- Dallas Cowboys receiver James  
McKnight, acquired from Seattle six weeks ago to be a deep threat, 
is lost for the season with a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	McKnight tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee  
during an intrasquad scrimmage Thursday night. He'll undergo 
surgery within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	McKnight, who cost the Cowboys a third-round pick in next year's  
draft, is the second player whose season was ended by a knee injury 
in training camp, joining offensive lineman Mike Kiselak. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough to lose a guy you thought had great potential to  
come in, make plays and be a positive force on your football 
team,'' Dallas coach Chan Gailey said. ``But it gives an 
opportunity for someone else to make plays. That's the way we have 
to look at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKnight's injury was by far the most severe on a night filled  
with bumps and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornerback Kevin Mathis bruised his back and offensive lineman  
Flozell Adams pulled a leg muscle. Gailey said they're the most 
likely to miss the exhibition opener Monday night against the 
Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone else is not completely healthy, but they'll be able  
to go,'' Gailey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Irvin and safety George Teague each suffered slight  
concussions. Receiver Jeff Ogden bruised his tailbone and fellow 
receiver Wane McGarity needed three stitches to close a cut on his 
chin. 
</P>
<P>
	McKnight was penciled in as the fourth or fifth receiver; the  
Cowboys will keep as many as six. His absence virtually guarantees 
that fourth-round pick Wane McGarity will make the team and it 
helps the chances of MarTay Jenkins, Jason Tucker and John 
Washington, none of whom have played in the NFL.

<HEADLINE> Texas Hotel Blast Injures Dozens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                       *Associated Press Writr    	
</P>
<P>
	GRAPEVINE, Texas (AP) -- A possible gas leak at a new hotel near  
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport may have led to the 
explosion that seriously burned at least one person and lacerated 
dozens with broken glass. 
</P>
<P>
	A gas line feeding the heater for the swimming pool at the  
Embassy Suites Outdoor World hotel might have been responsible for 
Friday's blast, said General Manager Bill Bretches. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion blew through an exterior wall and the hotel's gift  
shop in the pool area of the hotel, which opened Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bretches said the heater was being serviced by a contractor, who  
was the most severely injured by the blast. The worker was 
airlifted to a Dallas hospital where he was listed late Friday in 
serious condition with second-degree burns over his face and arms. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first crews on the scene reported some sort of gas  
release,'' said Sandy Smith of TXU Electric &AMP; Gas, the local gas 
utility. ``We don't have any indication of that yet, but it could 
be that one of the workers inadvertently cut a gas line and it 
exploded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said they smelled gas both before and after the blast.  
</P>
<P>
	Chief David Anderson of the Grapevine Fire Department said eight  
other victims were taken to hospitals for treatment of cuts and 
burns. About two dozen other people were treated by paramedics at 
the scene for cuts primarily caused by flying glass. 
</P>
<P>
	A Texarkana woman was in a glass elevator overlooking the pool  
when the explosion took place. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw people just running and panicking,'' Stacie Duncan said.  
``I saw children with glass stuck in their legs screaming for their 
parents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve-year-old Katie Mack was swimming with her cousin and  
little sister at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a huge boom. We were underwater, but I had my eyes  
open and the water went all black,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Katie and her sister suffered cuts to their feet while  
running across the broken glass to reach their mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was glass and insulation and parts of the wall floating.  
The pool was black and filled with wires -- people were still in 
there so (the wires) couldn't have been live,'' said Sandy Mack, 
who had brought her family to the hotel for the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the hotel's 600 guests and 200 workers milled about the  
parking lot as emergency workers investigated the blast hours 
later. Guests and their luggage were to be taken to other hotels in 
the area after hotel workers were allowed back into the building.

<HEADLINE> 3 Plead Not Guilty in ValuJet Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Three men indicted in connection with the 1996  
ValuJet crash that killed 110 people pleaded innocent to charges of 
conspiracy and making false statements. 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney entered the same plea for the men's employer,  
SabreTech Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The two ex-mechanics, Mauro Valenzuela and Eugene Florence, and  
Daniel Gonzalez, the company's former vice president of 
maintenance, entered their pleas Thursday before U.S. Magistrate 
Judge Ted Bandstra. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge granted the defendants' request for a jury trial,  
which is scheduled to begin Nov. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The company and the men are charged with conspiracy and making  
false statements that led to the 1996 crash of Flight 592. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators say SabreTech took oxygen canisters from another  
ValuJet plane, mislabeled them as empty, packed them up and 
delivered the carton to a ValuJet ramp, where it was loaded aboard 
Flight 592. Investigators said the canisters ignited in the cargo 
hold of the DC-9, transforming the jet into an airborne inferno 
that nose-dived into the Everglades. 
</P>
<P>
	This is believed to be the first time that criminal charges have  
been filed against maintenance workers in a U.S. plane crash. 
SabreTech also faces state charges of murder and manslaughter for 
illegally packaging the oxygen canisters, which also were missing 
required yellow safety caps. 
</P>
<P>
	The three men remained free on bond. Each could be sentenced to  
up to 55 years in prison and fined $2.7 million if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	SabreTech no longer is in the aircraft maintenance business. Its  
parent, St. Louis-based Sabreliner, sold the subsidiary's assets 
after SabreTech lost two maintenance base licenses and its business 
dwindled.

<HEADLINE>  Gwynn Is Padres' Batsman Forever </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Tony Gwynn is one consistent guy.  
</P>
<P>
	He's played for only one team in his 18-year career, the San  
Diego Padres. He's hit better than .300 for 16 straight seasons and 
is tied for Honus Wagner with eight NL batting titles. 
</P>
<P>
	He got his first two hits in his major league debut on July 19,  
1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Hit No. 1 was a double off Philadelphia's Sid Monge. On the  
field that night was Pete Rose, who would become baseball's career 
hit king. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rose trailed the play and said, `Congratulations. Don't catch  
me in one night,''' Gwynn said. ``That's always going to stick with 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday night at Montreal, Gwynn singled in the first inning  
for his 3,000th career hit. 
</P>
<P>
	He was in a rush to get it, too, having said he wanted to beat  
longtime contemporary Wade Boggs to the mark. Boggs had 2,997 hits 
going into Friday night's home game for Tampa Bay against 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn became the 22nd member of the 3,000-hit club, and Boggs is  
bound to become the 23rd. 
</P>
<P>
	But getting to 3,000 wasn't a breeze for Gwynn, 39.  
</P>
<P>
	After a hot April, he strained his left calf breaking out of the  
batter's box on May 21 and ended up making two trips to the 
disabled list, missing 44 games. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed all but two of the Padres' franchise-record 14-game  
winning streak in late June-early July. Gwynn, one of the most 
affable and accessible players in the majors, was frustrated. Not 
as much that his drive for 3,000 hit the skids, but because he was 
missing out on an exciting stretch for the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been very uncomfortable, very difficult,'' Gwynn said  
recently. ``I just want to get there as quickly as possible and get 
back to normal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn uttered those words even before Jim Leyritz took a potshot  
just before he was traded from the Padres to the New York Yankees, 
hinting that Gwynn wasn't exactly a team player. 
</P>
<P>
	The same thing often was said about Boggs, a five-time AL  
batting champion and left-hander hitter like Gwynn. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Gwynn tried to imitate Boggs in his early years.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was the hitter I wanted to be like,'' said Gwynn, who won  
his first batting title the year after Boggs won his first. ``He 
became the hunted. I wanted to emulate him. So for me, there's a 
connection because we're both similar in our approach, except that 
Wade's a whole lot more patient. He was the guy I had to chase.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Gwynn, that approach has been to put the ball in play using  
all fields. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it didn't count in his career totals, Gwynn's favorite  
hit was his homer to right field in the first game of last year's 
World Series at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, Gwynn loves to carve hits the other way. He became so  
proficient at hitting between third base and shortstop that he 
began calling it the ``5.5 Hole'' -- in baseball scoring, the third 
baseman is represented by 5 and the shortstop, 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn even has ``5.5 Hole'' patches on the tongue of his cleats.  
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn played basketball and baseball at San Diego State, and it  
wasn't until his senior season that he decided to stick with 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	He loved basketball and thought he might have a shot at the NBA,  
but didn't start half the games due to an injury suffered the 
previous summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was sitting on the bench and thinking, `I've got to think  
about my career here.' It just dawned on me that I probably had a 
better chance at baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``And about halfway through my senior year I started sneaking  
down to the baseball field and hitting in the cage and taking 
ground balls and stuff. So by the time basketball season ended and 
I went out to play baseball, I was kind of ready, where before I 
would just go straight from basketball to baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was a third-round draft pick of the Padres in June 1981, and  
made his big league debut a little more than a year later. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn won his first batting title in 1984. He won the other  
seven in bunches, from 1987-89, and 1994-97. 
</P>
<P>
	As he got older he seemed to get better, never hitting lower  
than .353 from '93-'97. Last year he fell off to .321, but did hit 
.500 in the World Series as the Padres were swept by the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	His best year was 1994, when he was batting .394 when the  
players' strike began. It was the highest in the majors since Ted 
Williams batted .406 in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the break I was hitting .383 and was really on a good  
roll,'' Gwynn said. ``I was hitting the ball hard and using all 
fields. If I was going to hit .400, I knew that was going to be my 
best crack at it. Unfortunately for me and everyone else, we didn't 
finish the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, that was the year I was doing a whole lot of things  
right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For a guy who's hit .339 for his career -- the best among active  
big leaguers -- a lot of people would say he's done a whole lot of 
things right his entire career.

<HEADLINE> Bills' Moulds Making His Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREDONIA, N.Y. (AP) -- Buffalo receiver Eric Moulds saw the small  
scrum of reporters forming in his path. It would have been easy for 
him to blow them off. 
</P>
<P>
	He burned NFL defensive backs for a Bills' season record of  
1,368 yards and earned a Pro Bowl invitation last year. He led the 
AFC in receiving yards and topped the league in yards per catch. 
</P>
<P>
	But trouble has a habit of catching up with even the swiftest  
receiver. In the offseason Moulds was ordered to serve a 30-day 
jail term for contempt of court for delaying child support 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Moulds, who is appealing the sentence, paid all of the back  
child support and complied with the other arrangements a few days 
before he was to go to court over the matter. He didn't dodge the 
issue at training camp Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were some things that happened in my past that came back  
against me,'' Moulds said. ``It's something I have to learn from.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year Moulds learned how to be a success in the NFL.  
</P>
<P>
	``Right now I'm trying to stay healthy and get ready for another  
long season,'' said Moulds, the No. 1 draft pick in 1996 who caught 
67 passes and averaged 20.4 yards per catch last year after two 
disappointing seasons. ``We have a few new wrinkles in and it will 
be interesting to see how far we go this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moulds had 49 catches for 573 yards in 1996-97. ``People were  
saying this guy is a first-round pick and maybe he's a bust or 
something,'' said Moulds, who set an NFL playoff-game record with 
240 receiving yards in a 24-17 loss to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	His 1998 yardage total broke Andre Reed's team record of 1,312,  
set in 1989, was tops in the AFC and was second only to Green Bay 
wideout Antonio Freeman's 1,424. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 1 pick Antoine Winfield of Ohio State, a quick and  
hard-hitting defensive back, knew he was up against the best when 
he lined up against Moulds. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's quick off the ball, he's strong,'' Winfield said. ``He's  
the real deal. In order to get better I have to go against him and 
Andre Reed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moulds had a hot start last season but really caught fire at  
Carolina on Oct. 25, when he hauled in five passes for 145 yards 
and two touchdowns, including an 82-yarder. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Flutie, who was 18-of-22 against the Panthers that day as  
part of a breakthrough season of his own, learned to look for 
Moulds. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a quarterback it's important to have a guy you know is  
going to be there when you need him,'' said Flutie, also a Pro 
Bowler last year. ``Eric was my security blanket, and I'm going to 
count on him even more this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moulds made a believer out of himself Nov. 29 with 177 receiving  
yards against New England and Ty Law, a Pro Bowl cornerback who led 
the NFL with nine interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I played against Ty Law and had a pretty good game against  
him, and I started wondering how good I could really be,'' Moulds 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He found out the next week at Cincinnati with a season-high 196  
yards and two touchdowns on six catches, an average of 32.7 yards 
per catch. Moulds had another 100-yard day against the New York 
Jets in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last five games he was probably close to the best receiver  
in the league, the best I saw for sure,'' Buffalo coach Wade 
Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He made a whole bunch of extraordinary catches, but finishing  
it was the biggest thing,'' Bills receiver Kevin Williams said. 
``This year he's even stronger, he's even faster and he wants to do 
it. Man-on-man coverage, he's on another level. They're going to 
have to do some different things to contain him. I can't wait.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moulds still has his legal matter hanging over him and says the  
appeal process could take up to two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing is just waiting and not knowing what's going to  
happen,'' he said. ``It's just something that I have to go through, 
and a lot of guys, like Bruce Smith and Thurman Thomas, told me to 
just concentrate on football and then whatever happens after that, 
just deal with it.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Blamed for Heroin Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican lawmakers said today Colombian  
``narco-guerrillas'' are winning the drug war, blaming what they 
called the Clinton administration's ``abysmal'' record of 
delivering assistance to the Colombian police. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite five years of congressional pleas for assistance to  
Colombia, countless hearings and intense congressional efforts, 
resources approved by Congress have failed to be provided to 
Colombia,'' said Rep. John Mica, R-Fla., chairman of a House 
Government Reform subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	A subcommittee hearing chaired by Mica on the Colombian drug  
problem split largely along party lines with Democrats responding 
to GOP charges of weakness by arguing that U.S. resources would be 
better spent on reducing demand than by focusing on interdiction. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Janice Schakowsky, D-Ill., said there has been no net  
reduction in drug flows from Colombia despite outlays of $625 
million in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why should we believe that investing more in this plan will  
achieve a different result?'' she asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., who chairs the House International  
Relations Committee, testified that the administration's failure to 
get high-performance helicopters to Colombia is ``directly 
responsible for the massive heroin crisis'' on the U.S. East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. response under the current administration to both the  
increasing drug threat and the growing insurgency menace in 
Colombia has been benign neglect at best and gross negligence at 
worst,'' Gilman asserted. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Congress appropriated funds in 1996 to purchase over 30  
new long-range, high-altitude helicopters for the Colombian 
National Police for eradication of opium poppy fields. But, he 
said, only two have been delivered. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilman added that heroin-related deaths and overdoses in the  
United States ``could have and should have been eradicated at the 
source'' years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug issue will be high on the agenda for Under Secretary of  
State Thomas Pickering, who is planning to meet with Colombian 
President Andres Pastrana on Tuesday in Bogota. Also on the agenda 
will be Colombia's increasingly powerful leftist insurgency. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration denies it has been ignoring the drug problem.  
</P>
<P>
	Colombia ranks third on the list of aid recipients with $289  
million earmarked for counter-drug activity this year. Barry 
McCaffrey, the White House drug control chief, said recently an 
additional $1 billion is needed because current efforts are falling 
short. He said the situation has reached ``emergency'' proportions. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug war also is costing the United States in other ways:  
five U.S. soldiers were killed two weeks ago when their U.S. Army 
spy plane crashed into a Colombian mountainside while on a 
counter-narcotics mission. Two Colombian Air Force officers also 
were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Another component of the counterdrug effort is training by U.S.  
Special Forces of a 1,000-member Colombian anti-narcotics 
battalion, which will be ready for duty toward the end of the year. 
Colombian officials are hopeful the battalion can neutralize 
guerrillas who finance their operations by protecting coca fields. 
This would allow the police to carry out fumigation and eradication 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernard Aronson, who served as former President Bush's chief  
policy-maker, said that despite these efforts, neither President 
Clinton nor Secretary of State Madeleine Albright ``has paid 
sustained attention to Colombia.''

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Denies Pressure Over Boeing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan did not force government-controlled  
China Airlines to cancel 12 Boeing 777 airplanes in retaliation 
against U.S. policy toward the island, a government official said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't given (China Airlines) any pressure whatsoever. It  
is entirely up to China Airlines to decide on plane purchases based 
on their needs,'' Transportation Minister Lin Fong-cheng told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline spokesman Scott Shih also disavowed political  
interference in the deal, saying China Airlines ``formed 
consensus'' on the plane purchases at least six weeks ago, before 
the eruption of recent tensions between the island nation and 
China. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, apparently in the belief that the Taiwanese  
government had interfered, U.S. trade officials have urged Taipei 
to follow through on the Boeing order, and several Washington 
politicians were scrambling to salvage it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle Times and The News Tribune of Tacoma, Wash.,  
reported Thursday that Taipei had told China Airlines to cancel the 
$2 billion order in protest of the Clinton administration's 
mainland China policy. Taipei had instead ordered the airline to 
purchase 12 A340 planes from Boeing's arch rival, Airbus Industrie 
of Europe, the papers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui infuriated mainland  
China by saying his island and China should regard each other on a 
``state to state'' basis, a statement the Beijing government saw as 
a step toward formal independence by Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration then angered Lee by reiterating its  
support for Beijing's stance, telling Lee it would not support any 
change in current U.S. policy. Beijing considers Taiwan a renegade 
province. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Bremerton, said he talked with White House  
Chief of Staff John Podesta late Thursday and asked that he 
consider involving President Clinton directly in the Boeing 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's up to his staff to decide whether the president should  
get involved,'' Dicks said. ``We will see what happens, but this is 
obviously time-urgent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing had been expecting a formal announcement of the 777 deal  
at any time. China Airlines signed a letter of intent to buy those 
jets, as well as 13 747s, in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Shih, the China Airlines spokesman, would not disclose what  
planes the airline would order, but said contracts would probably 
be signed next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing declined comment on the situation. Airbus said only that  
it would welcome an order as the market for wide-body airplanes 
softens. 
</P>
<P>
	``A wide-body order would be particularly nice to have at this  
point in time,'' said David Venz, an Airbus spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing officials were headed to Taipei over the weekend,  
ostensibly for the announcement of an even larger order from China 
Airlines for 13 747-400 freighters. That deal, worth about $2.5 
billion, will be the largest order ever for the cargo version of 
the jumbo jet.

all fields. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it didn't count in his career totals, Gwynn's favorite  
hit was his homer to right field in the first game of last year's 
World Series at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, Gwynn loves to carve hits the other way. He became so  
proficient at hitting between third base and shortstop that he 
began calling it the ``5.5 Hole'' -- in baseball scoring, the third 
baseman is represented by 5 and the shortstop, 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn even has ``5.5 Hole'' patches on the tongue of his cleats.  
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn played basketball and baseball at San Diego State, and it  
wasn't until his senior season that he decided to stick with 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	He loved basketball and thought he might have a shot at the NBA,  
but didn't start half the games due to an injury suffered the 
previous summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was sitting on the bench and thinking, `I've got to think  
about my career here.' It just dawned on me that I probably had a 
better chance at baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``And about halfway through my senior year I started sneaking  
down to the baseball field and hitting in the cage and taking 
ground balls and stuff. So by the time basketball season ended and 
I went out to play baseball, I was kind of ready, where before I 
would just go straight from basketball to baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was a third-round draft pick of the Padres in June 1981, and  
made his big league debut a little more than a year later. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn won his first batting title in 1984. He won the other  
seven in bunches, from 1987-89, and 1994-97. 
</P>
<P>
	As he got older he seemed to get better, never hitting lower  
than .353 from '93-'97. Last year he fell off to .321, but did hit 
.500 in the World Series as the Padres were swept by the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	His best year was 1994, when he was batting .394 when the  
players' strike began. It was the highest in the majors since Ted 
Williams batted .406 in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the break I was hitting .383 and was really on a good  
roll,'' Gwynn said. ``I was hitting the ball hard and using all 
fields. If I was going to hit .400, I knew that was going to be my 
best crack at it. Unfortunately for me and everyone else, we didn't 
finish the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, that was the year I was doing a whole lot of things  
right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For a guy who's hit .339 for his career -- the best among active  
big leaguers -- a lot of people would say he's done a whole lot of 
things right his entire career.

<HEADLINE> Daewoo, GM To Form Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The troubled Daewoo group signed a  
memorandum of understanding with General Motors Corp. of the United 
States today to form an alliance in auto manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
	While the details have yet to be worked out, Daewoo and GM  
officials said they hope the memorandum leads to future cooperation 
in the production and sale of cars both in South Korea and 
elsewhere in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Entering an (agreement) is to explore opportunities for  
further relationships,'' Alan G. Perriton, president of GM Korea, 
said at a joint news conference with Daewoo. ``We will proceed as 
fast as it is practical.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cash-strapped Daewoo hopes the alliance would lead to fresh  
capital investment from the American auto giant. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim Tae-gu, chairman of Daewoo Motors Co., expressed hope that  
the negotiations will be wrapped up ``as quickly as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kim said GM's capital investment and the future managerial  
control of the South Korean auto firm will be discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	The tie-up is the latest in a series of moves by GM, the world's  
largest automaker, to expand its relatively small presence in Asia, 
which many see as one of the potentially fastest growing car 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp. also said today that it is in talks  
with GM about building a small passenger car at a Suzuki plant in 
Indonesia for sale in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	The automakers hope to sell jointly built cars by next year, a  
spokesman for Suzuki said. GM is Suzuki's biggest shareholder with 
10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, GM officials in Detroit said their company will  
consider building vehicles in Japan to boost sales in the world's 
second-largest car market. 
</P>
<P>
	GM said it has a ``multi-pronged'' approach to increasing sales  
in Japan. The automaker sold about 53,000 cars and trucks in Japan 
last year, a tiny slice of the country's 4 million-vehicle market. 
</P>
<P>
	For its part, cash-strapped Daewoo has previously said it wanted  
General Motors to buy part of Daewoo Motors Co., its main 
subsidiary and South Korea's second-largest car maker. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors owned half of Daewoo Motors from 1978 to 1992 in  
a deal that allowed Daewoo to sell cars overseas using GM brand 
names. Their rocky marriage ended in 1992 with Daewoo buying out 
GM's share. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo has since started an aggressive, debt-financed expansion  
program, buying dilapidated auto plants in Poland and other former 
communist countries and developing nations, including India. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo Motor signed a memorandum with General Motors in February  
1998 to form a broad business alliance, but the transaction was 
never completed. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo, South Korea's second-largest conglomerate, narrowly  
escaped becoming South Korea's largest-ever bankruptcy in July when 
domestic creditors, mostly under government control, agreed to 
delay repayment of $5.8 billion in short-term debt for six months 
and extend $3.3 billion in new loans. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, Daewoo promised to cut its debt drastically by  
selling or spinning off most of its 40 subsidiaries and attracting 
foreign investment.

<HEADLINE> Deutsche Telekom To Buy One2One </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Deutsche Telekom, the giant German  
telecommunications company, announced Friday it would buy the 
British mobile phone company One2One in an $11.1 billion deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Telekom boss Ron Sommer, who has sought to turn the former state  
telephone monopoly into a global player in telecommunications, said 
the One2One purchase would strengthen Telekom's position in one of 
the most important European markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are acquiring an attractive and well-managed mobile  
telephone operator with a strong brand name and considerable growth 
potential,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	One2One, the smallest of Britain's four mobile phone businesses,  
is owned jointly by Cable &AMP; Wireless PLC of London and MediaOne 
Group, based in Englewood, Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	The transaction must be approved by Telekom's supervisory board  
and European Union antitrust regulators. The deal is expected to be 
complete by the end of September. 
</P>
<P>
	One2One has 2.6 million subscribers in the United Kingdom and is  
growing fast, especially among business customers, the companies 
said. Telekom's T-Mobil subsidiary has 7.4 million customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable &AMP; Wireless chief executive Graham Wallace said the sale  
would wipe out the company's debt, which was $6.4 billion at the 
start of the financial year in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The partially privatized Telekom has been searching for a  
foreign partner for some time. In June, it raised about $11 billion 
in a stock offering which Sommer said would be used to finance 
acquisitions and mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	Telekom sought earlier this year to merge with Telecom Italia,  
but lost out in May to a hostile bid by Olivetti SpA. In addition 
to One2One, recent media reports had said it was interested in 
Spain's Telefonica. 
</P>
<P>
	Telekom said Friday that it expects T-Mobil and One2One would be  
able to expand roaming capabilities and save money in such areas as 
technology and procurement. 
</P>
<P>
	Both partners will be able to reap benefits from their  
substantial marketing experience, Telekom said. 
</P>
<P>
	``One2One has very successfully opened up the British mass  
market with prepaid cards, a market segment that is still 
relatively underdeveloped in Germany,'' Telekom said. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, T-Mobil will be able to share its experience with  
business customers, Telekom said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal included an assumption of $2.4 billion of debts and  
repayments of $383 million in loans to shareholders.

<HEADLINE> Sens. Seek New Special Counsel Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Special prosecutors who would be appointed to  
handle sensitive investigations lack the degree of independence 
needed for public confidence, two senators complained Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Attorney General Janet Reno, Sens. Arlen Specter,  
R-Pa., and Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said her rules do not 
adequately differentiate the president, vice president and Cabinet 
officers from lower-ranking federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The senators said the rules could let an attorney general  
curtail a special prosecutor's investigation by cutting off funding 
and increase the odds that targets of a probe could improperly 
learn of details. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the inherent conflict of interest when the attorney  
general investigates the president or other high-ranking executive 
branch officials, these investigations are unlikely to satisfy the 
public's demand for impartiality,'' Specter and Lieberman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno announced the special counsel rules on July 1, a day after  
an independent counsel law expired amid criticism of Kenneth 
Starr's investigation of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice spokesman Myron Marlin said department officials had yet  
to review the senators' letter but believed ``our regulations 
strike a proper balance between the independence of the special 
counsel and the need for accountability on the part of the attorney 
general.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Specter and Lieberman said the rules ``may well work well for  
those special counsels investigating all but the top level of 
federal officials.'' They suggested giving special counsels greater 
independence for investigations of top officials. 
</P>
<P>
	They said past special counsels, including Watergate  
investigator Archibald Cox, were all ``granted significantly 
greater discretion and autonomy than your rules allow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The senators said that while Reno might have the best  
intentions, ``we are concerned about the possibility that some 
future attorneys general may not maintain such high standards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the rules, a prosecutor would have to notify the attorney  
general before seeking an indictment in a sensitive case, and she 
could veto a planned indictment. If she vetoed a proposed action by 
a prosecutor, she would be required to notify Congress and explain 
the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department would set a special counsel's budget.  
</P>
<P>
	Under the independent counsel law, prosecutors were named by a  
three-judge panel. Specter and Lieberman, members of the Senate 
Government Affairs Committee, have proposed a more modest version 
of the law.

<HEADLINE> Gwynn Makes Mom's Birthday Special </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Tony Gwynn improved on the birthday present he  
gave his mother six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn became the 22nd player in major league history with 3,000  
career hits Friday night when he singled in the first inning off 
Montreal Expos rookie Dan Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Six years earlier, Gwynn got his 2,000th career hit against  
Colorado's Bruce Ruffin on his mother Vendella's birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of ironic that I can get 3,000 on her birthday,  
too,'' Gwynn said before Friday's game. ``I'm going to try my best 
but it's like I told her this afternoon, I'm not going to try to 
force the action, I'm just going to try to take what they give 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn was delighted that Vendella, who was celebrating her 64th  
birthday, was in the stands for the game along with his wife, 
Alicia, daughter Anisha, his niece and agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's gone from one end of the country to the end of another  
country to see this and it means a lot having her here,'' Gwynn 
said of his mother. ``I thought 2,000 was a pretty good one, but 
for a contact hitter this is the ultimate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked before the game what he knew of Smith, Gwynn had a  
frank response. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not a thing, don't want to know a thing,'' Gwynn said. ``I  
don't want to know a thing. This is a good night to just kind of go 
up to the plate and react to what you see and not try to force the 
issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn explained that he used a similar approach to rap out four  
hits in the last two games of San Diego's four-game series in St. 
Louis after going 1-for-9 at the outset. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first two games in St. Louis I knew who I was facing and I  
tried to force the issue and made a whole lot of outs,'' Gwynn 
said. ``I came back to reality and told myself to just take what I 
get and try to do something with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While in St. Louis, Gwynn also drew on the collective wisdom of  
three members of the select group he joined Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody I've talked to in the last four days -- Lou Brock,  
Stan Musial, Paul Molitor was there last night -- all of them who 
have all gotten 3,000 hits have told me the same thing: Keep it 
simple, see the ball, hit it and have some fun. Don't let this 
thing consume you. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's easier said than done but I know what they're talking  
about. They're talking about just going up there and doing what you 
always do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conscious of cameras following his every move, Gwynn had looked  
forward to getting the hit behind him for a chance to return to the 
low-key approach he prefers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I realize now what a McGwire or a Griffey or a Bonds really  
has to deal with on a regular basis where for me it's just been 
pretty much you go out there, you prepare and get ready to play 
baseball, you play baseball, you go home, go to sleep, and then you 
do it again,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, every turn, everywhere I go -- never have I walked  
downtown Montreal, nobody knows who I am, but today I had kids 
chasing me all over the place this morning. It's nice to be in the 
spotlight and everything but I kind of like it better the other 
way.''

<HEADLINE> Kite Struggles To Reclaim Game  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAND BLANC, Mich. (AP) -- There was a time in Tom Kite's career  
when a sand wedge shot from 60 or 70 yards out that failed to stop 
within 6 feet of the flagstick ``was a major upset.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Kite, once regarded as the best in the game from 100  
yards in, has been having trouble putting his wedges within 20 
feet. And the declining confidence in this once unfailing aspect of 
his game has spread to other areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The death of longtime teacher and mentor Harvey Penick in 1995  
was a major loss for Kite. And his role as captain of the U.S. 
Ryder Cup team that lost to Europe in 1997 cut deeply into his own 
golf game. Kite bottomed out earlier this summer when he sat out 
for three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Kite of old seems to be re-emerging. In his first round  
Thursday at the Buick Open, Kite missed only two fairways and four 
times put his iron shots within that magic 6-foot barrier, 
including one of his patented sand wedges to within 3 feet on the 
first hole. It all added up to an opening-round 66, one shot off 
the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Kite's 66 Thursday put him a shot behind Brent Geiberger, whose  
bogey-free 65 put him in the lead alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just trying to piece together some sort of golf game that  
would allow me to compete,'' Kite said. ``The scores I've been 
shooting out here this year haven't been scaring anybody'' -- except 
Kite himself, that is. 
</P>
<P>
	His last PGA Tour victory came in 1993 when he won the Nissan  
Los Angeles Open. In 1998 he was unable to gain a top-10 finish for 
the first time in his 26-year career. This year, the slide 
continued as Kite missed eight cuts in his first nine tournaments, 
with only one round in the 60s. 
</P>
<P>
	The old techniques of working through a problem weren't working  
this time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kind of felt like one of those rats in a maze. You make so  
many turns, you obviously don't know where you are and just trying 
to get back to where you started is hard,'' Kite said. 
</P>
<P>
	Never having experienced a slump like this, Kite tried a new  
approach: putting down his clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	He stayed away from golf for almost three weeks. With the  
driving range being rebuilt at his home club in Austin, Texas, Kite 
set up a mat and netting in his garage. His teaching pro, Chuck 
Cook, was in England, so Kite set up a video camera and looked at 
his own swing. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever Kite did, something clicked. He made his return last  
week at Hartford and posted his best finish of the year -- tied for 
17th. On Thursday, his metronome swing was back in form. His round 
could have gone lower had relatively short putts on his final two 
holes fallen. 
</P>
<P>
	At 49, Kite is looking forward to playing on the Senior Tour  
next year and wants to join that elite group of golfers -- Jack 
Nicklaus, Hale Irwin, Ray Floyd among them -- who continued to 
contest for major championships into their late 40s and early 50s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really do think it's realistic,'' Kite said. ``I'm hitting  
the ball as far as I ever have.'' The key, he says, might be in his 
head rather than his swing and will require ``not dwelling too much 
on the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Tryba had six birdies, an eagle, a par and a bogey on the  
back nine for a 29, tying the tournament record for lowest 9-hole 
score at the 7,105-yard, par 72 Warwick Hills Golf and Country Club 
outside of Flint, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	Two dozen players were bunched within three shots of Geiberger,  
who won his first PGA Tour event last weekend. They included Tom 
Lehman and Bob Tway at 5-under and Ernie Els, Vijay Singh and Fred 
Funk in a large group at 4-under. 
</P>
<P>
	Spanish sensation Sergio Garcia, 19, shot a disappointing 73,  
including a double-bogey on the 401-yard 10th hole when he got 
stuck under a tree.

<HEADLINE>  Worry About Attacks on Peacekeepers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Violent flare-ups involving NATO  
troops injured a Russian soldier and an ethnic Albanian and 
prompted a peacekeeping spokesman to express concern today about 
attacks on Kosovo peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence overnight included three attacks on Russian  
soldiers at checkpoints in eastern Kosovo, an exchange of gunfire 
with people trying to attack a Serb home in the southern city of 
Urosevac, and three cases in which shots were fired at other NATO 
checkpoints or patrols. 
</P>
<P>
	One Russian soldier was wounded in the thigh, and an ethnic  
Albanian was seriously injured in the incidents. NATO forces 
detained a total of 15 suspects, said Maj. Jan Joosten, spokesman 
for the peacekeeping force in Pristina known as KFOR. 
</P>
<P>
	``KFOR is very concerned about the current attacks against its  
soldiers,'' Joosten said, adding that the rules of engagement allow 
the foreign troops a robust response to any attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence came amid a series of attacks on minority Serbs by  
ethnic Albanians. More than 160,000 Serbs have fled the province as 
a result, and Belgrade has protested that the NATO forces are 
failing to protect both sides equally. 
</P>
<P>
	Joosten said the security situation in Kosovo was generally  
better, but he acknowledged the overnight violence marked an 
increase in incidents involving peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	In the incidents listed by Joosten:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Unidentified assailants attacked three Russian checkpoints in  
Koretin and Kosovska Kamenica, driving a vehicle into one of them 
and firing shots at two others. Ethnic Albanians in the eastern 
region have been protesting the presence of Russian troops, whom 
they consider to be sympathetic toward the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Troops protecting a Serb house in Urosevac exchanged fire with  
attackers in a white station wagon, and a U.S. Apache helicopter 
followed the vehicle. One wounded man was arrested at Pristina 
hospital, where the car was found. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Shots were fired above a checkpoint in southern Kosovo near  
Prizren, and an ethnic Albanian was arrested after weapons were 
found in his car. NATO has forbidden Kosovars from being armed. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A patrol in Pec, in western Kosovo, came under fire and one  
suspect was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Shots were fired near a checkpoint in the southwestern  
Djakovica area, and the search of a nearby house turned up an 
assault rifle and a grenade. The occupant was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence is considered a threat to the ability of NATO and  
the United Nations to set up a civil administration in Kosovo to 
run the territory until elections can be held. 
</P>
<P>
	Nadia Younes, the U.N. spokeswoman in Pristina, said today that  
a transition council of ethnic Albanians and Serbs set up to form 
new governing structures would probably hold its second meeting 
sometime in mid-August. 
</P>
<P>
	She said ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova and Hashim Thaci,  
the former guerrilla leader who heads an interim administration in 
Kosovo, had met with U.N. mission chief Bernard Kouchner for more 
than three hours this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Rugova and Thaci indicated they would join the council  
meeting, Younes said. Rugova's party boycotted the first meeting 
last month, complaining it lacked proper representation. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.N. refugee agency said today it resolved a  
dispute with Macedonian authorities over a $2,450 inspection fee 
charged trucks transporting humanitarian aid to Kosovo. The U.N. 
had held back hundreds of trucks in Macedonia's capital, Skopje, 
while trying to resolve the issue this week, spokesman Ron Redmond 
said.

<P>
	Joosten said the security situation in Kosovo was generally  
better, but he acknowledged the overnight violence marked an 
increase in incidents involving peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	In the incidents listed by Joosten:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Unidentified assailants attacked three Russian checkpoints in  
Koretin and Kosovska Kamenica, driving a vehicle into one of them 
and firing shots at two others. Ethnic Albanians in the eastern 
region have been protesting the presence of Russian troops, whom 
they consider to be sympathetic toward the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Troops protecting a Serb house in Urosevac exchanged fire with  
attackers in a white station wagon, and a U.S. Apache helicopter 
followed the vehicle. One wounded man was arrested at Pristina 
hospital, where the car was found. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Shots were fired above a checkpoint in southern Kosovo near  
Prizren, and an ethnic Albanian was arrested after weapons were 
found in his car. NATO has forbidden Kosovars from being armed. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A patrol in Pec, in western Kosovo, came under fire and one  
suspect was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Shots were fired near a checkpoint in the southwestern  
Djakovica area, and the search of a nearby house turned up an 
assault rifle and a grenade. The occupant was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence is considered a threat to the ability of NATO and  
the United Nations to set up a civil administration in Kosovo to 
run the territory until elections can be held. 
</P>
<P>
	Nadia Younes, the U.N. spokeswoman in Pristina, said today that  
a transition council of ethnic Albanians and Serbs set up to form 
new governing structures would probably hold its second meeting 
sometime in mid-August. 
</P>
<P>
	She said ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova and Hashim Thaci,  
the former guerrilla leader who heads an interim administration in 
Kosovo, had met with U.N. mission chief Bernard Kouchner for more 
than three hours this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Rugova and Thaci indicated they would join the council  
meeting, Younes said. Rugova's party boycotted the first meeting 
last month, complaining it lacked proper representation. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.N. refugee agency said today it resolved a  
dispute with Macedonian authorities over a $2,450 inspection fee 
charged trucks transporting humanitarian aid to Kosovo. The U.N. 
had held back hundreds of trucks in Macedonia's capital, Skopje, 
while trying to resolve the issue this week, spokesman Ron Redmond 
said.

<HEADLINE>  Deutsche Telekom To Buy One2One </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Deutsche Telekom, the giant German  
telecommunications company, announced Friday it would buy the 
British mobile phone company One2One in an $11.1 billion deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Telekom boss Ron Sommer, who has sought to turn the former state  
telephone monopoly into a global player in telecommunications, said 
the One2One purchase would strengthen Telekom's position in one of 
the most important European markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are acquiring an attractive and well-managed mobile  
telephone operator with a strong brand name and considerable growth 
potential,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	One2One, the smallest of Britain's four mobile phone businesses,  
is owned jointly by Cable &AMP; Wireless PLC of London and MediaOne 
Group, based in Englewood, Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	The transaction must be approved by Telekom's supervisory board  
and European Union antitrust regulators. The deal is expected to be 
complete by the end of September. 
</P>
<P>
	One2One has 2.6 million subscribers in the United Kingdom and is  
growing fast, especially among business customers, the companies 
said. Telekom's T-Mobil subsidiary has 7.4 million customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable &AMP; Wireless chief executive Graham Wallace said the sale  
would wipe out the company's debt, which was $6.4 billion at the 
start of the financial year in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The partially privatized Telekom has been searching for a  
foreign partner for some time. In June, it raised about $11 billion 
in a stock offering which Sommer said would be used to finance 
acquisitions and mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	Telekom sought earlier this year to merge with Telecom Italia,  
but lost out in May to a hostile bid by Olivetti SpA. In addition 
to One2One, recent media reports had said it was interested in 
Spain's Telefonica. 
</P>
<P>
	Telekom said Friday that it expects T-Mobil and One2One would be  
able to expand roaming capabilities and save money in such areas as 
technology and procurement. 
</P>
<P>
	Both partners will be able to reap benefits from their  
substantial marketing experience, Telekom said. 
</P>
<P>
	``One2One has very successfully opened up the British mass  
market with prepaid cards, a market segment that is still 
relatively underdeveloped in Germany,'' Telekom said. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, T-Mobil will be able to share its experience with  
business customers, Telekom said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal included an assumption of $2.4 billion of debts and  
repayments of $383 million in loans to shareholders.

<HEADLINE> Winnie the Pooh Piano Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A small part on a toy piano may pose a choking  
risk to children and has forced the recall of more than 200,000 of 
the toys. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Product Safety Commission said Thursday that pieces  
on a microphone attached to the Tiger Electronics Pooh Poppin' 
Pianos may break off and create a hazard for young children. 
</P>
<P>
	No choking incidences or injuries have been reported, said Russ  
Rader, commission spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The lime green, eight-key piano has figures from ``Winnie the  
Pooh,'' including Pooh, Tigger and Roo. Only toys with serial 
numbers starting with ``WT'' or ``CO15D'' have the defective 
microphone. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiger Electronics of Vernon Hills, Ill., sold the toys from  
August 1997 until this month for about $20. Consumers should call 
1-888-748-2860 to find out how to receive a safe replacement toy.

<HEADLINE> Pan Am Games Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- As the United States piled up more  
medals Friday, including a gold by weightlifter Lea Foreman, team 
officials defended the selection process for the Pan American 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	USOC executive director Richard Schultz said the games have been  
run well, calling it a ``gold medal performance'' by the Winnipeg 
organizers. He also took exception to suggestions the United States 
did not bring its best athletes these games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've accomplished a lot of things here,'' Schultz said.  
``We've seen the media sometimes refer to the U.S. bringing their B 
team. That's not correct. We brought a good combination of athletes 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz said the games showcased well-known veteran athletes  
such as softball star Dot Richardson and up-and-comers such as 
19-year-swimmer Ed Moses, who won the gold medal and set a Pan Ams 
record in the 100-meter breaststroke. 
</P>
<P>
	As Friday's competition began, the United States had won 235  
medals, 87 gold. Schultz said that was on par or slightly better 
than the U.S. performance at the 1995 Pan Ams in Mar Del Plata, 
Argentina, where there were 99 more medal events. 
</P>
<P>
	Four Americans have won three medals: Kathy Colin in  
canoe/kayak, Marty Nothstein in cycling, Chad Hedrick in roller 
skating and swimmer Scott Tucker. Nothstein won three golds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're happy with the success of our athletes,'' said Herman  
Frazier, chief of the U.S. delegation. ``There's some things that 
have been said about the athletes we brought here. We brought 
athletes who wanted to compete on the international level and who 
wanted to win on the international level. Our results speak for 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz singled out the performance of the baseball team, a  
collection of minor leaguers who earned a berth for the United 
States in the 2000 Olympics by reaching the gold medal game against 
Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you stop to think that the International Baseball  
Federation only takes two baseball teams from the Americas, that's 
really a challenge,'' Schultz said. ``Because probably three or 
four of the best baseball teams in the world are in the Americas. 
</P>
<P>
	``With only two of those teams being eligible, that's a real  
challenge. So the real key here was for the baseball team to get to 
the gold medal game and that happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foreman, of Denmark, Wis., lifted 215 kilograms (474 pounds) to  
take the 69-kilo (152-pound) class. It was the second U.S. gold in 
the games for a woman weightlifter; Robin Byrd Goad earlier won the 
53-kilo class. 
</P>
<P>
	Denise Parker of Salt Lake City, the leading qualifier, took her  
11th Pan Ams medal with a bronze in archery. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada, the only team to United States in the round-robin of  
men's softball, did it again, 2-1 in the medals round. If the 
Americans can beat Cuba on Saturday, they get another shot at 
Canada for the gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Two U.S. boxers, Gerald Tucker and Arthur Palac, went for gold  
Friday night. The men's basketball team took on Argentina in the 
semifinals, while the women's softball powerhouse played Canada. 
The American men played Canada for the soccer bronze medal.

<HEADLINE> Unleaded Gas Leads Energy Prices Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Unleaded gas futures prices were up Friday on New York  
Mercantile Exchange as supplies continue to fall during the busy 
summer driving season. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, soybean, grain and orange juice futures prices  
also rose. 
</P>
<P>
	Unleaded gas is pulling other energy futures, including crude  
oil, upward -- with unleaded gas posting highs not seen in two years 
-- said energy analyst Tim Evans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had eight consecutive weeks in which inventories have  
fallen,'' said Evans, who works for Pegasus Econometric Group in 
New York. ``It's driving season so demand is higher and production 
isn't keeping up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that's not necessarily unusual for this time of year.  
But U.S. unleaded gas inventories are below what they were a year 
ago by 9.4 million barrels, according to the American Petroleum 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	``The deficit contributes to our sense that the market is  
tight,'' Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Friday, September crude rose 32 cents to $20.88 a  
barrel; September unleaded gasoline was up 1.35 cents to 65.83 
cents a gallon; September heating oil rose 1.10 cents to 54.53 
cents a gallon; and September natural gas was up 5.1 cents to 
$2.698 for each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent Blend crude oil for delivery in  
September broke the $20 barrel level for the first time since 
November 1997, finishing up 26 cents to $20.06 at the International 
Petroleum Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, soybean and grain futures prices finished the day  
higher on the Chicago Board of Trade amid forecasts for more dry 
weather next week in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices had fallen early in the day amid forecasts for weekend  
rain. But meteorologists are now calling for a high-pressure ridge 
to move in over much of the grain belt, bringing with it more dry 
weather that could continue to hurt crops. 
</P>
<P>
	That news sent soybean and corn futures prices on an upward  
climb in a day of choppy trading -- with wheat futures following. 
</P>
<P>
	There also were reports that the July soybean crop will be below  
U.S. Department of Agriculture forecasts. Analysts say that may 
mean that recent bouts of hot, dry weather may also affect yields 
later in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Friday, wheat for December delivery was up 1 1/4 cents  
to $2.95 3/4 a bushel; December corn rose half a cent to $2.35 1/2 a 
bushel; December oats were up a quarter-cent to $1.17 3/4 a bushel; 
and November soybeans were up 2 3/4 cents to $4.83 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, prices for orange juice futures rose on the Board of  
Trade of the City of New York amid comments from a key Brazilian 
agricultural official. 
</P>
<P>
	Joao Carlos Meirelles, agricultural secretary for the state of  
Sao Paulo, said his state expected to have no growth in orange 
output for the next three to four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Sao Paulo is one of Brazil's biggest citrus producers.  
</P>
<P>
	In trading Friday, orange juice for September delivery was up  
2.65 cents -- more than 3 percent -- to 84.50 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Medical Pot Patient Gets Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- The first Californian to fight federal  
drug charges using the state's voter-approved medical marijuana law 
was sentenced Friday to 27 months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	B.E. Smith, accused of growing pot on federal land, was  
convicted in May of felony marijuana possession and cultivation. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Garland Burrell imposed a higher sentence  
than prosecutors sought and said Smith has shown an ``utter disdain 
for federal marijuana law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Marijuana is an evil in American society and a serious threat  
to people,'' Burrell told a courtroom packed with Smith's 
supporters. ``The public is only going to be protected from further 
crimes if Mr. Smith is incarcerated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, 52, was an outspoken supporter of Proposition 215, which  
permits the growth and consumption of pot for medical use. It was 
approved in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The law could have shielded Smith in state court because he has  
a doctor's recommendation to grow and smoke the plant to relieve 
post-traumatic stress disorder from his service in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	But possession and cultivation of marijuana remains illegal  
under U.S. law. Federal officials have repeatedly told state 
officials that medical marijuana users risk federal prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	``Marijuana is a political tool but this is an issue of  
compassion and patients are caught in the middle of this 
politicking,'' said Thomas Ballanco, Smith's attorney. ``And B.E 
Smith was brave enough to stand up and put his foot in the middle 
of that wheel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith plans to appeal his conviction, Ballanco said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Remembers Embassy Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Remembering the dead from attacks on U.S.  
embassies in Africa one year ago, President Clinton pledged Friday 
that ``we will prevail against terrorism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The intended victims of this vicious crime stood for  
everything that is right about our country and the world -- 
Americans and Africans, working together for peace and progress and 
a better future,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Twin explosions last Aug. 7 the U.S. embassies in Kenya and  
Tanzania killed 12 Americans, 44 Kenyans and Tanzanians working at 
the embassies, and more than 200 other people. U.S. officials have 
blamed the attacks on a terrorist cell linked to Osama bin Laden. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton later ordered missile attacks on a bin Laden training  
camp in Afghanistan, and the United States has offered $5 million 
in rewards for his capture and the capture of several associates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their violence could not and did not make America shrink from  
the world,'' Clinton said. ``Instead of giving in to those who wish 
us harm, we have stayed engaged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In the end, we will prevail against terrorism because the  
spirited dedication of men and women like those who perished last 
Aug. 7 lives on,'' he said. ``No bullet or bomb can ever destroy 
it.''

<HEADLINE> Method of Watergate Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Associated Press poll on Watergate and President Nixon is  
based on telephone interviews with 1,012 randomly selected adults 
from all states except Alaska and Hawaii. The interviews were 
conducted July 28-Aug. 1 by ICR of Media, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were weighted to represent the population by key  
demographic factors, such as age, sex, region and education. 
</P>
<P>
	No more than one time in 20 should chance variations in the  
sample cause the results to vary by more than 3 percentage points 
from the answers that would be obtained if all Americans were 
polled. 
</P>
<P>
	This margin of sampling error is larger for responses of  
subgroups, such as income categories. There are other sources of 
potential error in polls, including the wording and order of 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	1. It has been more than 25 years since the Watergate break-in  
caused a political scandal in Washington. Do you know enough about 
Watergate to tell someone else about it? 
</P>
<P>
	--Yes, 40 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--No, 60 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	2. Which statement comes closer to your view about Watergate? It  
was a very serious matter that revealed corruption in the Nixon 
White House; or it was just politics -- the kind of thing both 
parties engage in? 
</P>
<P>
	--Very serious matter, 48 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--Just politics, 45 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--Don't know, 6 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--Refused, 1 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	3. Looking back, do you think President Nixon's actions  
regarding Watergate were, or were not, serious enough to warrant 
his resignation? 
</P>
<P>
	--Yes, were serious enough, 62 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--No, were not serious enough, 26 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--Don't know, 12 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	4. Twenty-five years from now, do you think Richard Nixon will  
be remembered more for the Watergate scandal or for his policies as 
president? 
</P>
<P>
	--Watergate, 72 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--His policies, 22 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--Don't know, 6 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	5. Do you think the charges of misconduct against President Bill  
Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky matter were more serious than the 
charges made against President Nixon in Watergate, less serious or 
about as serious? 
</P>
<P>
	--More serious, 18 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--Less serious, 45 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--About as serious, 33 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--Don't know, 4 percent.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Still Biggest Arms Provider </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States retains its title as the  
world's largest supplier of weapons, raising its total to $7.1 
billion even though demand has been slumping worldwide, a 
congressional study found. 
</P>
<P>
	Developing nations such as Saudi Arabia and Malaysia remain the  
biggest buyers despite the constraints of the Asian financial 
crisis and lower oil prices, the Congressional Research Service 
said in its annual review of arms sales. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, the United States led in new arms deals, with $7.1  
billion -- up from $5.7 billion the year before. Despite the 
increase, that's considerably below the $21.5 billion in U.S. arms 
sales in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany ranked second, with $5.5 billion in new sales, and  
France third, with $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The value of all new arms sales worldwide was $23 billion, up  
slightly from $21.4 billion the year before, but down from the 
$37.4 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said that the trend has been downward, with sales to  
developing nations -- the biggest buyers of new arms -- at $13.2 
billion in 1998, down from $23 billion in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The Asian financial crisis and low oil prices have contributed  
to the decline in demand, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Competition for available arms sales continues to intensify  
among major weapons suppliers,'' wrote the report's author, Richard 
F. Grimmett, a national defense specialist with the research 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	``The limited resources of most developing nations to expend on  
weapons, and the need of many selling nations to secure cash for 
their weapons, continues to place constraints on significant 
expansion of the arms trade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the United States increased its sales to developing  
countries to $4.6 billion last year, up from $2.6 billion in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest buyer of arms last year was Saudi Arabia, with $2.7  
billion in new sales. The United Arab Emirates ranked second at 
$2.5 billion. Malaysia ranked third, with $2.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	They were followed by Egypt, $1.2 billion; Algeria, Israel and  
Kuwait, all $500 million; and Ethiopia, India and South Korea, all 
$400 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia, meanwhile, has seen its exports steadily declining since  
the end of the Cold War. In 1991, it sold $8.2 billion in arms. In 
1998, the total had declined to $1.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Developing nations accounted for 69.4 percent of all arms  
purchases from 1991 through 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Major weapons categories in the study included fighter jets,  
helicopters, artillery, tanks and other armored vehicles, 
surface-to-air missiles, surface-to-surface missiles and anti-ship 
missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Congressional Research Service, a branch of the Library of  
Congress, reports each year on weapons and other military equipment 
sales around the world.

<HEADLINE> Chiefs Trying To Replace Dale Carter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIVER FALLS, Wis. (AP) -- For seven years, Dale Carter's rare  
speed and cover ability helped energize one of the NFL's finest 
defensive secondaries. 
</P>
<P>
	With Carter at one corner and steady James Hasty on the other,  
the Kansas City Chiefs played an unusually aggressive, physical 
bump-and-run style that disrupted pass patterns at the line and set 
the tone for their defensive philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
	But Carter, who may have slipped a bit the past couple of  
seasons, is now plying his trade in Denver. And finding a 
replacement at left cornerback may be the biggest headache facing 
first-year Kansas City head coach Gunther Cunningham, who keeps 
insisting that what everybody figured to be a two-man battle has 
been joined by a third. 
</P>
<P>
	``You guys keep talking about Dishman and Gray. But I keep  
telling you that Eric Warfield is a part of that mix, too,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlton Gray, a 6-foot, 198-pounder with his fourth team in four  
years, will run with the first unit one day. The next day finds 
former All-Pro Chris Dishman, 6-0, 199, lining up with the first 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Dishman, who spent nine seasons at Houston and two with  
Washington, signed with the Chiefs after a poor season led to his 
release by the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	Warfield is in his second season with the Chiefs after being  
drafted in the seventh round out of Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cris is obviously the physical guy,'' said Cunningham. ``Gray  
and Warfield have tremendous physical talent to turn around and 
run. All are making plays. You see the receivers one day have a 
good day and then you see the corners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Gray nor Dishman is used to the aggressive bump-and-run  
that has characterized the Kansas City style. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not necessarily entirely different,'' said Gray. ``You  
play bump-and-run and man-to-man coverage everywhere you go. It's 
just that they place more emphasis on stalling your man at the line 
of scrimmage. That's probably the biggest difference. You're more 
aggressive than with other teams because they want to mess up the 
timing at the line of scrimmage other than just shadow the guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toward the end of the week, Cunningham did seem to be leaning  
toward Dishman. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's my kind of guy,'' he said. ``He's a nasty sonofagun.  
You're blessed once in a while to get a player with that attitude 
and character and toughness. He lays it on the line every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Carlton's still in the fight, there's no question about  
that,'' he added. ``Eric Warfield is still in the fight. He's doing 
a good job. Eric Warfield has probably been the most consistent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before his poor season last year with the Redskins, Dishman was  
acknowledged as a topflight defensive back. He has 37 career 
receptions, 17 forced fumbles and 13 recovered fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he'll turn 34 next week, Dishman insists there was a  
good reason for his slump. He and his wife adopted a child, he 
said, and he spent a lot of time bonding with the lad. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been easy to have my wife deal with him and just  
go train and get ready for the season,'' he said. ``I didn't want 
to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year, he insists, he has come into camp in top condition.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel a lot better,'' he said. ``I feel like my speed and  
quickness are back. Just a few extra pounds, you can feel the 
difference.''

<HEADLINE> Paula Jones Due Back in Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BENTON, Ark. (AP) -- Paula Jones' lawsuit against President  
Clinton may be over, but her legal woes are not. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones has an October court date to fight a ticket charging  
her with driving with a suspended license. She pleaded innocent via 
fax to the Saline County Municipal Court on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, she would have to pay a $275 fine, plus court  
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	A state trooper stopped Ms. Jones in late June after noticing  
that her 1993 Mercedes Benz had a busted tail light. She was cited 
after a check showed that her California driver's license had been 
suspended for failure to appear on a misdemeanor charge involving 
unpaid fines. 
</P>
<P>
	The fines in the California case were paid this week.  
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Ms. Jones reached an $850,000 settlement with the  
president to drop her lawsuit accusing him of sexual harassment.

<HEADLINE> Ferguson Nominated for Fed Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton on Friday nominated Roger W.  
Ferguson, a Harvard-trained economist and lawyer, to be vice 
chairman of the Federal Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	In making the announcement, Clinton said, ``He will be the first  
African-American vice chair of the Fed. He is superbly qualified. 
He has served well and I am very excited about the prospect of his 
service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson, 47, was first appointed to the seven-member Fed board  
of governors two years ago by Clinton. If confirmed by the Senate 
as vice chairman, he will fill a vacancy created by the departure 
of Alice Rivlin in July. 
</P>
<P>
	While holding a doctorate in economics from Harvard as well as a  
law degree, Ferguson has focused much of his attention on the board 
on technical matters, including overseeing the Fed's plans to deal 
with the Year 2000 computer problem and heading up a panel that is 
searching for ways to upgrade the central bank's check clearing 
operations for commercial banks. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan praised  
Ferguson's selection, saying Clinton had ``chosen a person highly 
respected by his colleagues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Clinton announced that he was nominating Carol  
Parry, 58, a former official at Chase Manhattan Corp., to a vacancy 
on the Fed board that was created more than a year ago with the 
resignation of Susan Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
	Private economists predicted little change in policy direction  
with the elevation of Ferguson to the No. 2 spot or the addition of 
Parry to the board. Both officials were expected to take their cue 
in monetary matters from Greenspan, who has first appointed Fed 
chairman in 1987 by President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
	Some economists also said Ferguson's selection made it even more  
likely that Clinton will re-appoint Greenspan for a fourth term as 
chairman when his current term expires next June 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``This cements a good working environment and indicates the  
chairman plans to stick around,'' said economist Mark Zandi of 
Regional Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, as he has in the past, refused to tip his hand on  
Greenspan's future when asked by reporters Friday other than saying 
that Greenspan had done ``a terrific job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investors are growing increasingly nervous that the Fed is about  
to raise interest rates for a second time this year because of 
worries that tight labor markets will trigger inflationary wage 
pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton refused to speculate on whether this will occur, saying  
only, ``We should do everything we can, those of us with political 
responsibilities in the government, to fight inflationary pressures 
so we continue to create jobs and raise incomes without 
inflation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A former partner at the consulting firm of McKinsey &AMP; Co.,  
Ferguson joined the board in November 1997. At McKinsey, Ferguson 
specialized in management of information-technology systems. On the 
Fed he has worked to improve the central bank's check payment 
system and help prepare the institution for the year 2000 computer 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson issued a statement saying that during his time on the  
board he had ``been engaged in a wide range of policy matters'' and 
looked forward to expanding his role at the Fed. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm,  
R-Texas, said Gramm did not have a chance to review the nomination 
files before leaving for the August congressional recess. However, 
neither nomination was expected to face major hurdles in winning 
Senate approval. 
</P>
<P>
	With the new nominations, Clinton still has one vacancy to fill  
on the seven-member board that sets U.S. interest rate policies and 
regulates the country's largest banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson is the third black to serve on the Fed board, following  
Andrew Brimmer, nominated by Lyndon Johnson in 1966, and Emmett 
Rice, nominated by Jimmy Carter in 1979.

<HEADLINE> Airlines Woo Business Travelers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Attempts by the major airlines to woo business  
travelers with new perks like bigger first-class sections and more 
leg room in some rows may not find fans in the cheap seats. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they hate it now, they're going to hate it worse later  
because the airlines ... are making the seats smaller. They're 
making everything smaller in the back of the bus,'' said Tom 
Parsons, editor of Bestfares.com, a Web site that tracks fares and 
sells tickets. ``Airlines are more concerned with taking care of 
that big-ticket person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This week, United Airlines introduced a $30 million plan to rip  
a row of economy-class seats out of each domestic plane to add 4 to 
5 inches of leg room for passengers who pay top dollar for economy 
class tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, it's for the road warriors -- business travelers  
who make up 9 percent of United's passenger load but account for a 
whopping 46 percent of ticket revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of business-class passengers trapped in economy  
class,'' said United President Rono Dutta. And they're demanding a 
higher class of service -- mostly, more room to stretch out and 
maneuver with laptop computers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who track the industry say they are hearing more  
complaints from passengers. That crankiness has only been 
exacerbated by labor troubles at American and Northwest airlines 
and reports of passengers getting bumped frequently by Delta and 
other airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Delays are increasing. Complaints are increasing,'' said Karen  
Goodwin, editor of Frequent Flyer magazine, based in Oak Brook, 
Ill. ``Service is perceived to be worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parsons, himself an ``elite'' frequent flyer on several  
airlines, applauds the attempts to appease flyers who may be paying 
four to six times as much for an economy ticket as the vacation 
travelers they've been sitting next to. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you can't get an upgrade then you're thrown back in the zoo  
-- the back of the bus. All the crying kids, all the people who 
don't know what's going on,'' Parsons said. ``So you say, `I'm 
never going to fly this airline again.''' 
</P>
<P>
	United and TWA, which recently announced an expanded first  
class, have been praised by groups that represent passengers, 
including the Washington-based Air Travelers Association. And some 
airlines are essentially dropping expiration dates for 
frequent-flyer miles, which many passengers use for upgrades. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, many travelers are far from satisfied.  
</P>
<P>
	Even though he's 6-foot-2, Coleman Conley says he's not so  
worried about having more leg room -- or fancy service. The Chicago 
stockbroker says he'd rather pay less for tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're just painting a picture to demand a higher cost,''  
Conley said. ``When you think about it, a plane is really no 
different than a bus with wings.''

<HEADLINE> Calloway Out With Sprained Ankle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- The Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Chris  
Calloway will be sidelined for two to four weeks with a sprained 
left ankle, the club said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may be only two to three weeks,'' Calloway said. ``I  
definitely hope it's before the opener.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calloway sprained the ankle during pass drills Thursday when he  
caught a pass and was knocked down by Ray Buchanan, who fell on the 
ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the ankle will remain in the boot to stabilize it until  
the swelling goes down. He said the swelling wasn't as bad Friday 
as it was immediately after the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Calloway is entering his 10th NFL season. He signed with the  
Falcons as a free agent in March after spending his last seven 
years with the New York Giants.

<HEADLINE> Some Cos. Lose, Some Win in Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Al Pinkerton hasn't had a day off since May. As the Al in Al's  
Water Hauling Service, he's been making emergency deliveries at all 
hours to homeowners whose wells run low, trailer parks with dry 
cisterns and farmers with thirsty animals. 
</P>
<P>
	While people with weather-dependent businesses, such as farmers  
and landscapers, are losing money because of the dreadful Eastern 
drought, the driest of times means the best of times for some 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	Business is up for water haulers, well drillers, and even  
contractors, who are running ahead of schedule on some projects 
because so few work days have been lost to rain. And you'll get no 
dry whines from vintners, either. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinkerton's company operates six tractor-trailer-sized water  
tankers that he fills with water from West Penn Water Co., the 
company that serves Pittsburgh and the surrounding area. 
</P>
<P>
	The 53-year-old Pinkerton has pulled some all-nighters and his  
10 employees have been busy all summer. The company trucked about 4 
million gallons of water to customers during July, about 1 million 
gallons more than normal for the month, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He wouldn't mind a break.  
</P>
<P>
	``I guess it's good (for business), but it's hard to keep  
control of everything,'' he said. ``If we get a little bit of rain, 
it will taper off some.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The drought has also meant a deluge of business for drilling  
companies trying to sink wells faster than water tables recede. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawk Drilling Co. in Ballston Spa, N.Y., which usually gets 30  
orders all summer, has received more than 50 since May. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palmer Drought Index -- which goes from +5 to -5 with -5 the  
most serious -- has hit -4.7 this summer in the Mohawk Valley of New 
York state, drying up older, shallower wells. 
</P>
<P>
	As the company juggled calls, emergency work for a hospice  
forced those on the long waiting list to wait even longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like we're almost playing God, and we don't want to be  
that,'' said Janice Baldwin, Hawk Drilling's vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	The drought is so severe that farmers in West Virginia and  
drought-stricken parts of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Maryland, Virginia 
and Kentucky are eligible for federal low-interest loans because of 
their withered crops. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, President Clinton said the current drought is the  
worst ever recorded for agriculture in four Northeastern states -- 
Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey and Rhode Island. He said it 
threatens to cripple businesses and communities that depend on 
devastated farm economies. 
</P>
<P>
	Nursery and landscaping firms are laying off workers. And New  
England merchants and innkeepers already are bracing for reduced 
tourism this fall, as the drought robs the autumn foliage of some 
of its majesty. 
</P>
<P>
	The drought is unlikely to have an immediate economic impact,  
though, other than damage to farmers, said Mark Vitner, economist 
at First Union Capital Markets Group in Charlotte, N.C. Tourism 
hasn't been greatly affected, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the summer, people want to go to the beach and the beach  
has plenty of water,'' he said. ``The mountains are still cool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said Friday the drought has  
not driven up commodity and consumer prices because it is not 
affecting the large growing regions of the Midwest and California. 
</P>
<P>
	In Maryland, the drought has vintners looking forward to a good  
year. Grapes have deep roots that can reach moist soil, and dry 
weather means darker, sweeter grapes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're almost a mirror image of other kinds of farming,'' said  
Rob Deford, president of Boordy Vineyards in the Baltimore County 
community of Hydes. ``They have all my sympathy, but we're doing 
very well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Al King, owner of Kanawha Stone in Charleston, W.Va., said the  
weather has idled his earthmovers only one day this summer. His 
company finished excavation work for a new shopping center ahead of 
schedule, and now a new home improvement store there will be 
completed next week, two months early. ``For the excavation 
business, it is pretty good,'' King said. 
</P>
<P>
	As lakes and rivers ebb, boaters are running aground, on rocks  
and sandbars that usually are far below the surface. 
</P>
<P>
	At Coastal Marina in Port Clinton, Ohio, where Lake Erie water  
levels are hitting 30-year lows, general manager Jeff Wilson said 
hull and propeller repairs are up 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But back on terra firma, sales are off 50 percent at the  
Bountiful Acres Nursery and Garden Center in Buckingham, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too dry to plant,'' owner Anne Matthews said.  
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the nursery laid off the 15 employees on its three  
landscaping crews. Customers' lawns dried up, shrubs were not 
growing enough to trim and it was too dry to plant. There were no 
mowers left to fix, or blades to sharpen. 
</P>
<P>
	The only thing selling was watering equipment.

<HEADLINE> India Builds Pyres for Crash Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAISAL, India (AP) -- Workers stacked wood into funeral pyres  
today for a mass cremation of disfigured, rotting corpses that 
remained unidentified days after one of India's worst train wrecks 
killed 285 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives of people thought to have died in the collision early  
Monday have searched through two hospitals in northeastern India 
where the bodies are laid out. But with so many victims crushed 
beyond recognition, 190 bodies remained unclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have been puzzling over what to do with the corpses,  
all decomposing rapidly in the 95 degree heat. Hospital workers had 
little ice and few chemicals to preserve the bodies, and a thick 
stench wafted from the clinics. 
</P>
<P>
	Fearing health risks, the northeastern state's top elected  
official ordered the mass cremations to go ahead today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decomposed bodies are posing serious health hazards for  
the local people,'' Chief Minister Jyoti Basu of West Bengal state 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In fields along two rivers meandering through the Himalayan  
foothills, 65 large funeral pyres were prepared with wood from a 
nearby forest. 
</P>
<P>
	Trucks waited at government hospitals six miles away in the town  
of Siliguri to cart the bodies to the pyres next to the Mahananda 
and Phuleshwari rivers for the cremations, which were scheduled for 
shortly after dusk today. 
</P>
<P>
	Hindu cremation ceremonies are often held near rivers -- many of  
them considered holy -- and the ashes often are sprinkled into the 
water. Many Hindus take the ashes of their kin to holy towns to 
immerse them with elaborate religious rituals. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors who examined bodies at two government hospitals said at  
least six of the dead were Muslims, and officials said they would 
be buried with Islamic rites by the Mahananda River. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is offering an immediate payment equivalent to  
$580 to families of the dead, and a larger sum after forms are 
processed. Officials are now insisting on clear proof of kinship 
after several people submitted fraudulent claims for compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	The collision occurred as two trains sped in opposite directions  
at 60 mph through the pre-dawn darkness. Many of the 2,500 
passengers were sleeping when one train was inexplicably diverted 
into the path of the other near Gaisal station, about 310 miles 
north of Calcutta. 
</P>
<P>
	Several railway signal operators working at the time of the  
accident fled the scene, and were wanted for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has suspended six top rail officials while it  
investigates the collision, and the Cabinet announced that a former 
Supreme Court justice would conduct an inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Railroad Minister Nitish Kumar offered his resignation the day  
after the accident, and it was accepted Thursday by Prime Minister 
Atal Bihari Vajpayee. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident was one of the deadliest in India's history. In  
1995, 358 people were killed in a train wreck near New Delhi, and 
in 1981, nearly 800 died when a cyclone blew a train off the tracks 
into a river in the northern state of Bihar. 
</P>
<P>
	India has the world's largest railway network under one  
management, with more than 14,000 trains carrying 12 million people 
daily. But it is plagued with accidents, which happen at a rate of 
more than one a day.

<HEADLINE> Senate Report Slams Media Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Parents need to do more to shield children  
from violence in movies, TV shows, music and other media, according 
to a Senate report issued Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The effect of media violence on our children is no longer open  
to debate,'' said the report prepared by the Republican staff of 
the Senate Judiciary Committee. ``We must now devote ourselves to 
reducing the amount and degree of violence in our media and to 
shielding our children from such harmful depictions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah asked for the report  
after the April shooting at Colorado's Columbine High School, which 
left 15 people dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that this report ... will further the discussion about  
the flood of media violence in this country and what should be done 
about it,'' Hatch said in discussing the 30-page document on the 
floor of the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	It reached three conclusions: that the media dominate children's  
lives, that they are ``exceedingly violent'' and that the images 
lead to real world violence, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch added that more than 1,000 studies in the past 40 years  
have examined the issue without changing the predominant finding. 
</P>
<P>
	``As one expert put it, arguing against the link between media  
violence and the violent actions of our youth is 'like arguing 
against gravity,''' Hatch said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report highlights provisions in a Senate-passed juvenile  
justice bill that addresses the issue, and it makes additional 
recommendations to Congress. It also offers suggestions for parents 
and the entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The report recommends that:  
</P>
<P>
	--Congress begin a national media campaign to educate parents and  
establish a national clearinghouse on children and entertainment 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	--The television, motion picture, music and video game industries  
be encouraged to rate their products using the same system. They 
now use separate systems. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Federal Trade Commission report twice a year on violence in  
the media and the entertainment industry's efforts to reduce it. 
</P>
<P>
	--Federal property used in programs for children be offered at  
reduced rates. 
</P>
<P>
	--Congress ban advertising for adult programming at times when  
children are most likely to be watching television or listening to 
the radio. The ban would also apply to publications designed for 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate juvenile justice bill would toughen penalties for  
juvenile offenders while providing states with $1 billion a year to 
fight juvenile crime and prevent delinquency. A House-Senate 
committee must work out differences between that bill and a version 
passed by the House before the White House can get a bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill also has provisions aimed at reducing children's  
exposure to violence, including a proposal for a limited antitrust 
exemption to allow the entertainment industries to develop 
voluntary guidelines and ensure retail compliance with existing 
rating and labeling systems. 
</P>
<P>
	It also calls for a national media campaign against youth  
violence, would ban the use of federal property in movies or TV 
shows that glorify violence and require Internet service providers 
to offer filtering technology to help parents limits their 
children's access to explicit material. The bill also authorizes 
several federal studies.

<HEADLINE> Life Sentences in Ala. Gay Slaying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKFORD, Ala. (AP) -- Two men who murdered a homosexual over  
unwanted advances will avoid the electric chair because the 
victim's family opposes the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury convicted Charles Butler Jr., 21, of capital murder  
Thursday in the slaying of Billy Jack Gaither, who was beaten to 
death and then burned atop kerosene-soaked tires in rural central 
Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	The case drew wide attention, with President Clinton comparing  
the slaying to the dragging death of a black man in Texas and the 
fatal beating of Matthew Shepard, a homosexual Wyoming college 
student who was lashed to a fence. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge John Rochester sentenced Butler to life in prison without  
parole, rather than the death sentence, at the request of Gaither's 
family and the prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't believe in the death penalty. The only one who's got  
a right to take a life is God,'' said Randy Gaither, the victim's 
brother. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Mullins, 25, who pleaded guilty to the murder and  
testified against Butler, also was sentenced today to life in 
prison without parole, at the request of the family. The judge said 
Thursday he has no choice on sentencing when the prosecution 
doesn't seek the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	The victim's father, Marion Gaither, said he hoped his son would  
not be remembered as a gay murder victim, but as a loving son who 
lived with -- and looked after -- his aging parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was one of the finest sons a man could want,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Gaither, a 39-year-old computer operator from Sylacauga, was a  
drinking buddy of Mullins. Mullins and Butler accused Gaither of 
propositioning them. Butler blamed the killing on Mullins, a 
skinhead who admitted cutting Gaither's throat and cracking his 
head open with an ax handle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in shock and didn't know what to do,'' Butler told the  
jury as he wiped away tears Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Fred Thompson said Butler had numerous chances  
to flee from the crime or get help for the victim. ``You went along 
every step of the way?'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, sir,'' Butler replied.  
</P>
<P>
	Butler also admitted helping Mullins burn the victim's body and  
torch his car to destroy evidence, but he said he was acting on 
orders from Mullins. 
</P>
<P>
	At 5-foot-3, 120 pounds, Butler was described by prosecutors as  
a sixth-grade dropout who resembled Opie from ``The Andy Griffith 
Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You could put him on Mayberry,'' according to prosecutor Jeff  
Willis. 
</P>
<P>
	Butler's family declined comment as they left the courtroom in  
tears. But Gaither's family hugged each other repeatedly outside 
the small town courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know Billy Jack knows what's going on and he's pleased,''  
Randy Gaither said.

<HEADLINE> Hatch Wants Probe of Clinton Judges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee  
has asked Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist to look into a judge's 
decision to assign cases involving President Clinton's friends to 
Clinton-appointed judges. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who is a presidential hopeful, told  
Rehnquist he was concerned that the incident ``may have 
repercussions on the public's confidence in the impartial 
administration of justice by the federal courts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press reported last weekend that U.S. District  
Judge Norma Holloway Johnson bypassed a traditional random 
assignment system and sent a criminal case against presidential 
friend Yah Lin ``Charlie'' Trie to U.S. District Judge Paul L. 
Friedman and similarly sent a separate tax case against 
presidential friend Webster Hubbell to U.S. District Judge James 
Robertson. 
</P>
<P>
	Trie's case was the first major prosecution from the Justice  
Department investigation of Democratic fund raising in the 1996 
election. Friedman, appointed to the bench by Clinton two years 
earlier, also was assigned by Johnson to two related cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other judges have expressed concern that the assignments  
had the appearance of a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Friedman dismissed various charges against Trie. One of  
Friedman's rulings was reversed on appeal, and Trie is to be 
sentenced in two weeks, probably to probation, on a plea-bargained 
guilty plea. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson dismissed the tax case against Hubbell, a former  
associate attorney general, who eventually pleaded guilty to a 
misdemeanor when an appeals court reinstated the case. Robertson 
was later chosen, at random, to handle a felony case against 
Hubbell that charged him with lying to federal regulators. 
Robertson threw out the central felony count in that case, but 
again an appeals court reversed him, and Hubbell eventually pleaded 
guilty to one felony count. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the editor published in The Washington Times  
earlier this week, Johnson said, ``Politics was not and is never a 
factor in our case assignments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Hatch, in his letter written Tuesday, asked Rehnquist to  
look into the matter using the Judicial Conference of the United 
States, a panel of judges that includes chief justices from each 
judicial circuit. As chief justice, Rehnquist is presiding officer 
of the conference, which makes policy concerning the administration 
of U.S. courts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish to ask you ... to consider whether an examination by  
the Judicial Conference might be warranted,'' Hatch wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	A Supreme Court spokeswoman said today that Rehnquist would have  
no immediate comment on the letter.

<HEADLINE> Development Planned Near Canyon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) -- Developers will be able to build  
housing, hotels and restaurants on 272 acres of prime national 
forest land just south of the Grand Canyon under a plan endorsed 
Friday by federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The $330 million Canyon Forest Village project in Kaibab  
National Forest, a gateway to the canyon, will include 1,270 hotel 
rooms and 270,000 square feet of retail space, the equivalent of 
four large department stores. The project also involves developing 
20 acres to house people working at Grand Canyon National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``Free enterprise in this region is alive and well,'' said  
Eleanor Towns, Southwest regional forester for the U.S. Forest 
Service, which approved the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone is so happy.  
</P>
<P>
	Several area businessmen and politicians have threatened to sue  
to stop the development. Locals fear a major commercial center will 
cut into their profits and threaten ground water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you add a Canyon Forest Village to the mix of an already  
fragile tourism economy I think you can do significant damage to a 
community like Flagstaff,'' said Rick Lopez, city councilman in 
Flagstaff, 80 miles south of the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
	Flagstaff resident and Navajo tribe member Sam Minkler said he  
doesn't like the way such projects are commercializing what was 
once held sacred. 
</P>
<P>
	``I personally miss our olden ways,'' said Minkler, noting the  
Navajo Nation was among the tribes that backed the project. ``But 
not now. We're trying too hard to be part of America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canyon Forest Village was the more ambitious of two plans  
considered by the Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The other plan, supported by local businesses, would have cut  
out 50 acres for federal housing and community facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Towns said Canyon Forest Village would better serve tourists,  
help address a housing crunch in the region and help control 
development. The Forest Service traded the project land along U.S. 
180 for 2,220 acres scattered throughout the forest that she noted 
could have been developed without any promises the environment 
would be safeguarded. 
</P>
<P>
	Project developer Tom De Paolo and his investors wooed local  
environmental groups and tribes into supporting Canyon Forest 
Village by promising to transport Colorado River water by train and 
pipeline from Arizona's western border instead of depleting ground 
wells in the park. 
</P>
<P>
	Grand Canyon National Park Superintendent Robert Arnberger said  
the park needed to look for outside solutions to its problems. 
Living space has gotten so scarce at the park that at peak times, 
many of the 3,500 residents are forced to cram into old, broken 
down trailers and tents. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have always looked at solving problems within our  
boundaries, creating a kind of island mentality.'' Arnberger said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Forest Service's decision ended five years of analysis and  
public wrangling over how to develop the national forest and who 
gets to benefit from it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm exhausted,'' De Paolo said. ``I'm anxious and looking  
forward to working with the community in implementing this 
project.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with the Grand Canyon Trust, an environmental group,  
applauded the Forest Service's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``This new gateway community will meet the needs of the park and  
its visitors, protect the regional environment and become an 
outstanding model for the park system nationwide,'' said trust 
president Geoff Barnard.

<HEADLINE> Pataki: I'll Back Rudy if He Runs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Gov. George Pataki will support Mayor  
Rudolph Giuliani in the race for a Senate seat from New York if the 
mayor moves quickly in announcing his candidacy, a top-level Pataki 
aide said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki, who has had a contentious relationship with Giuliani,  
will encourage Rep. Rick Lazio to delay his scheduled announcement 
of a run for the seat being vacated by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, 
said the aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor scheduled an afternoon news conference to make the  
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani has yet to announce his candidacy for the Senate, but  
was widely expected to run against likely Democratic candidate 
Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki's announcement could potentially defuse a nasty  
Republican primary fight between Giuliani and Lazio -- a struggle 
which could deplete their campaign funds and leave the winner 
vulnerable to the first lady. 
</P>
<P>
	Lazio has already said that he will announce his candidacy for  
the position during the week of Aug. 16. In late July, Lazio 
spokeswoman Inez Sanzeri said, ``Rick is running. He is in this 
race to win it.''

<HEADLINE> Americans Wins Bronze in Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- It wasn't Mexico. It wasn't the  
Confederations Cup. It was another bronze medal. For the United 
States, that's major progress. 
</P>
<P>
	With a goal in each half, the United States overcame a driving  
rain, gusting wind, a hostile crowd and Canada to win 2-1 Friday 
night and take third place at the Pan American Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``With our youngsters, U.S. soccer has never been in as good  
shape as it is right now,'' U.S. coach Clive Charles said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlos Bocanegra drove in a header off a cross from Cory Gibbs  
in the seventh minute. Then 17-year-old forward Landon Donovan of 
Bayer Leverkusen in Germany added a second off a rebound in the 
60th minute to give the United States only its third men's soccer 
medal in Pan American play. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming here with an amalgamated squad of under-17, under-20 and  
under-23 players, the United States admitted before the tournament 
began it came to Winnipeg to test prospects for the Olympic 
qualifying run next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The players had other ideas. They wanted a medal.  
</P>
<P>
	``You don't even know,'' Donovan said, unable to quantify the  
desire to get a medal despite the little hope observers gave them. 
``I'm just happy we won the game. That's all I care about. It's all 
about that bronze medal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The guys are going nuts,'' Charles said. ``They're very  
happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bronze medal came only three days after the United States'  
senior team beat Saudi Arabia 2-0 in Mexico City to take third 
place at the Confederations Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Bocanegra's header from the 6-yard line came amid intermittent  
rain. But then the skies opened up with heavy rain and strong 
winds. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a capacity crowd of about 8,000, Canada rarely  
threatened until the final 10 minutes. Chris Pozniak gave the host 
nation hope, launching a right-footer from just outside the arc 
past the outstretched arm of goalkeeper Tim Howard and into the 
upper right corner of the net in the 85th. 
</P>
<P>
	``They got up a goal early and we didn't play very well,''  
Canada coach Bruce Twamley said. ``They deserved it.''

<HEADLINE> Football Adds 5 to Hall Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANTON, Ohio (AP) -- Lawrence Taylor always approached his job as  
if he were one of the best in the business. The Pro Football Hall 
of Fame will second that opinion on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The former New York Giants linebacker will be joined by  
offensive guards Tom Mack and Billy Shaw, running back Eric 
Dickerson and tight end Ozzie Newsome when the class of 1999 is 
enshrined on the front steps of the hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor -- who became the fearsome prototype of a rush linebacker  
during his 13 seasons -- prepared for opponents and never lacked in 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Giants Stadium was my office. When I came to work, I knew  
everything about my job,'' he said. ``There was nothing you could 
throw at me that I didn't know because I knew everything about my 
job and I enjoyed doing it. That was a deadly combination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor's motivation was never to just do the job.  
</P>
<P>
	``When I came to work, I came to work planning on being the  
best,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor retired with two Super Bowl rings and a glittering stack  
of statistics. He totaled 142 sacks in his career and all but 
revolutionized his position with his athleticism and his mental 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was nasty. He's the nastiest kid I've ever been around,''  
said Denny Morrison, the Giants' defensive line coach who also 
coached Taylor at North Carolina. ``If you were lying on the ground 
and he was going back to the huddle, he might kick you in the 
head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Washington Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann said, ``If  
there ever was a Superman in the NFL, I think he wore number 56 for 
the Giants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since retiring in 1993, Taylor has encountered legal,  
substance-abuse and financial problems. He referred to those who 
didn't vote for his induction as ``old phonies'' who had no 
business judging him. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he's ready to mend fences.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm 40 years old and I've mellowed a lot since I was  
playing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	His induction fits neatly into his personal checklist.  
</P>
<P>
	``We do things in packages as far as life goes: high school  
ball, college ball, you want to get in the pros, make All-Pro and 
finally you want to be in the Hall of Fame. That has finally 
happened. I have a complete package.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those joining him fit that same description.  
</P>
<P>
	Mack, a 6-foot-3, 250-pound offensive guard, played all of his  
13 seasons with the Los Angeles Rams -- going 184 games without 
missing a game due to injury or illness. 
</P>
<P>
	He had to wait 11 years to finally get the call to Canton, while  
Shaw -- a sterling offensive guard for the Buffalo Bills from 1961 
to 1969 who was selected for induction by the veterans committee -- 
waited almost three times that. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were only three guards in the hall. Now he and I make  
five,'' Shaw said. ``I can't explain to you why more guards haven't 
made it into the Hall of Fame. But it's an honor. It'll be fun 
going in with Tom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dickerson frequently wrangled with management during his playing  
days. Contentious contract negotiations led to his trade from the 
Rams to the Colts. While in Indianapolis, he was suspended for 
refusing to take a team physical and for refusing to practice. The 
Colts eventually met his demand to be traded. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite 13,259 career yards -- third-best all-time behind Walter  
Payton and Barry Sanders -- Dickerson feels his induction confirms 
the respect he received from his peers. 
</P>

premier receiver and blocker with the Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was happy that he had to wait four years for  
induction because it now dovetails with the advent of the new 
Browns franchise, which plays Dallas in Monday night's Hall of Fame 
exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was disappointment the first year, the second year and  
the third year when I got into the final six but didn't make it,'' 
he said. ``But to be going in at the same time those guys are going 
back on the field -- those orange helmets show up and football 
returns to the lakefront -- that makes it worth the wait.''

	Dickerson will be presented by one of his Ram blockers, Jackie  
Slater. Mack followed suit in choosing a Ram teammate and offensive 
lineman, Ken Iman, as his presenter. Taylor will be introduced by 
his 17-year-old son, T.J., Newsome by former Browns teammate Calvin 
Hill and Shaw by a former Bills trainer.

<HEADLINE> US Men Go for Gold in Basketball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Forget those high-priced NBA stars.  
The low-budget CBA players wearing the red, white and blue are 
unbeaten in the Pan American Games, and now they're going for the 
gold. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. men's basketball team, getting clutch play down the  
stretch from James Blackwell and Carl Thomas, beat Argentina 84-76 
Friday night to earn a berth in Sunday's gold medal game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans will seek their first Pan Ams championship since  
1983 against Brazil, a team they beat 73-71 in pool play. Brazil 
advanced with an 95-85 victory over Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is why you come,'' U.S. coach Mo McHone said. ``I think  
our guys are focused, we've had great practices and we've really 
had a great effort. I feel like we're where we want to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't easy getting there, though.  
</P>
<P>
	Argentina, a team with outstanding shooters, came from 13 points  
down to take the lead on three occasions in the second half, the 
last time at 69-68 with 5:24 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	That's when Blackwell, just 1-for-7 from the field in the first  
three games in this tournament, suddenly rediscovered his shot. 
</P>
<P>
	With Damon Bailey waiting at the scorer's table to check in for  
him, Blackwell nailed a 3-pointer from the left wing with 4:55 to 
play. McHone then brought Bailey back to the bench and Blackwell 
connected again, this time with a jumper that made it 73-69. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had shots the entire tournament, I've just been in a  
slump,'' Blackwell said. ``I lost my confidence. In a 40-minute 
game, you don't have a lot of room for error. I'm a better 
percentage shooter than that and I just fought through it. All the 
guys supported me and that really helped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States never trailed again after Blackwell's baskets.  
Thomas hit a 3-pointer with 1:37 left and Travis Williams scored 
inside and made a slick move along the baseline for another basket 
that wrapped it up. 
</P>
<P>
	The scoring from Blackwell was a bonus, because McHone had him  
in the game for his defense. The former Dartmouth star was named to 
the CBA's all-defensive team last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's one of the things I like being with a team like this,  
because you never know exactly who is going to step up,'' McHone 
said. ``My strategy was to take him out and then he makes a 3. So I 
leave him in and he makes a jumper. That worked out pretty good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams made eight of 12 shots and led the United States with  
19 points. Thomas scored 13 points, Blackwell had 11 and Michael 
Hawkins and Doug Smith 10 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Argentina made three quick 3-pointers in jumping to a 16-6 lead.  
But the United States shut down the outside game the rest of the 
half and went on a 17-4 run to open a 42-29 lead, Smith capping the 
burst with a 3-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Argentines scored the final nine points of the half, and the  
U.S. lead in the second half was never more than six until the 
final minute. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did a little better job containing us in the second  
half,'' McHone said. ``We had to go with a smaller lineup and it 
was a group that hadn't played together for one minute in practice. 
I'm really proud of the way those guys handled it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They handled it well enough to give the Americans a chance to  
play for the gold. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not play for it, win it,'' Blackwell corrected. ``We'd rather  
win the bronze than lose the gold. Nobody on this team is here for 
the silver.''

	Jobless Rate Steady at 4.3 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's unemployment rate remained frozen  
in July at 4.3 percent, near a three-decade low, as manufacturing 
gained jobs for only the second time since early last year. The 
Labor Department reported today that the July jobless rate matched 
the June number as employers added a stronger-than-expected 310,000 
jobs to their payrolls. The strength in hiring last month reflected 
big gains in demand for workers at temporary help agencies, which 
posted their strongest rise in 18 months. Hiring of workers also 
showed big gains at restaurants, computer companies and engineering 
firms.

	IBM Confirms Tax Probe of Brit Biz

	LONDON (AP) -- IBM confirmed today that British tax authorities  
are investigating its accounts, amid reports that the company 
avoided paying taxes. International Business Machines Corp. the 
world's largest computer company, refused to divulge details of the 
case. It said it is cooperating with authorities. The Wall Street 
Journal reported today that the inquiry stems from allegations made 
by a former IBM employee that the company improperly avoided paying 
taxes in Britain by arranging for its British business unit to pay 
artificially high royalties to its U.S. parent. The paper 
attributed the information to people familiar with the matter. The 
Board of Inland Revenue, Britain's tax collection agency, refused

	CHICAGO (AP) -- United Airlines has announced plans to spend more  
than $30 million to create an ``economy plus'' section for its best 
customers who are unable to squeeze into first class. The airline 
will remove one row of seats from the economy section in each of 
its 450 airplanes used for domestic flights. The planes will be 
reconfigured to give passengers in the first six to 11 rows up to 
36 inches of legroom, instead of the standard 31 inches. The 36 
inches of legroom is two inches less than what first class 
passengers receive. The new section will not have all the other 
perks of first class.

``We haven't given (China Airlines) any pressure whatsoever. It is 
entirely up to China Airlines to decide on plane purchases based on 
their needs,'' Transportation Minister Lin Fong-cheng told 
reporters in Taipei today. Airline spokesman Scott Shih also 
disavowed political interference in the deal, saying China Airlines

<HEADLINE> Parcells Irritated With Jets Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- New York Jets coach Bill Parcells,  
irritated over the slow start of his offense in the first week of 
training camp, directed the blame at some of his headline players 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just not getting good production out of the players that  
should be producing well,'' Parcells said. ``It's some of our 
`Superstar Central' area. You know, when you just walk into the 
huddle and dial up a star anytime you want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following Thursday's afternoon workout under the club's  
all-weather bubble, the coach tore into his offense for 
lackadaisical play. The club is trying to determine starters at 
both guard positions, at the newly revamped F-Back slot and in the 
fourth wide receiver role. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was mad,'' second-year right tackle Jason Fabini said. ``We  
had a bad practice, so it's understandable. We had officials there 
and we committed about 15 penalties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added fullback Keith Byars: ``He's right about getting on us. He  
just can't stomach dropped passes, overthrows, underthrows and 
mental mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells' mood also has been affected by the chronically sore  
knee afflicting veteran tight end Eric Green, who has missed 
practice time, and a partially separated right shoulder that has 
sidelined F-Back Blake Spence. The coach also has expressed concern 
about quarterback Vinny Testaverde's sluggish start in passing the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been like the Keystone Cops sometimes, but we can do  
something about it,'' Byars said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first step in that direction may come Saturday morning when  
the Jets stage their first intrasquad scrimmage of the camp. The 
first-team offense is expected to see major action. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets finished last year ranked fourth in the league in  
offense, averaging 357.2 yards per game, and boasted the AFC's 
top-rated passing attack. Testaverde and receiver Keyshawn Johnson 
were Pro Bowl selections, with running back Curtis Martin an 
alternate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told you, it's the superstar group,'' Parcells said,  
declining to specify his trouble spots on the offense. ``We've got 
about seven in there, and a couple of wannabes, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets, coming off their first AFC East championship and a  
berth in the conference title game, open their exhibition season a 
week from Saturday at Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, the offense is struggling right now,'' center Kevin  
Mawae said. ``But I think Parcells is only trying to motivate us 
one way or another. I'd dismiss the myth of a superstar attitude.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Parcells won't.

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke Faces Big U.N. Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- When Richard Holbrooke arrives at the  
United Nations as U.S. ambassador, he will need all the 
troubleshooting skills he used to help bring peace to Bosnia to 
tackle a host of problems, from Iraq's disarmament to America's 
$1.6 billion in unpaid U.N. dues. 
</P>
<P>
	And time is short -- less than 18 months to make his mark.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's very hard to say what influence he will have,''  
said John Bolton, senior vice president at the conservative 
American Enterprise Institute. ``A lot of U.S. positions on key 
issues such as Kosovo and Iraq have been formed over the past 6 1/2 
years -- and it's very hard to change in the last 18 months of an 
administration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke will take his seat in a Security Council that is badly  
divided on a new policy toward Iraq and still chafing at the 
U.S.-led bombing of Yugoslavia without explicit council 
authorization. While Congress is complaining about U.N. 
peacekeeping costs, the council is also considering a costly new 
peacekeeping mission in Congo. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14 months between Holbrooke's nomination to replace Bill  
Richardson as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and his 
confirmation on Thursday by the Senate left President Clinton's 
administration open to criticism that the U.N. post wasn't a top 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
	``Holbrooke comes here with the same ball and chain that had so  
hobbled Bill Richardson here -- and that is the huge U.S. debt and 
the problem of Washington's seeming hostility to the United 
Nations,'' said Jeff Laurenti, director of policy studies at the 
United Nations Association of the United States, a nonprofit group 
promoting an effective United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Payment of the U.S. debt has been held up by conservatives in  
Congress. The Senate on June 22 passed legislation to free payments 
of $819 million in U.S. debts to the United Nations over three 
years and forgive $107 million that the United Nations owes the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The House version of the legislation, passed late last month,  
does not contain any language on U.N. arrears. Thus, the matter 
will have to be thrashed out by a House-Senate conference committee 
that has not yet met. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill passed by the Senate would also reduce the maximum U.S.  
share of the regular U.N. budget from the present 25 percent to 20 
percent. Holbrooke said during his confirmation hearings in June 
that he supports this reduction in the U.S. contribution. 
</P>
<P>
	Bolton insists the arrears issue has become an excuse for the  
Clinton administration's ``incompetent diplomacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He pointed to U.S. Marines getting bogged down in clan warfare  
in Somalia, the Dayton peace agreement -- which Holbrooke negotiated 
-- failing to restore a multiethnic society in Bosnia and the NATO 
bombing of Yugoslavia failing to preserve a multiethnic society in 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	But Timothy Wirth, president of the United Nations Foundation,  
which disburses Ted Turner's $1 billion pledge to U.N. causes, said 
the United States delegation loses influence by not paying. 
</P>
<P>
	``Great nations pay their bills, and not paying our bills really  
ties the hands of our team,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Laurenti said U.S. arrears and Congressional demands that the  
U.S. share of the U.N. budget be reduced from 25 percent to 20 
percent ``taint everything else that the U.S. ambassador tries to 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Congress fails again to pay the U.S. debt, ``Holbrooke will  
be playing defense for the next year and a half,'' Laurenti said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Holbrooke is a fighter with sharply honed  
diplomatic skills. He served as ambassador to Germany, assistant 
secretary of state for both Asia and Europe, and is currently the 
Clinton administration's special envoy to the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	``He comes in as perhaps the most hard-driving and tactically  
brilliant representative the United States has had here in nearly a 
decade,'' Laurenti said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke was on a plane at the time of the 81-16 confirmation  
vote in the Senate, headed to Seattle, and then Alaska, for a 
two-week family vacation. He will take office soon afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Holbrooke said he was ``deeply gratified'' by  
the vote. ``I would like to thank the president and the secretary 
of state for their unwavering support throughout this process,'' 
said the statement, read by a Holbrooke aide. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations is in many ways a chummy clique where  
personal contacts count, and where differences between governments 
can be overcome by ambassadors perceived as having clout in the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh, who has filled in for  
Holbrooke for almost a year, is widely admired and highly 
respected. But he is the first to admit that he isn't part of 
Clinton's inner circle. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Holbrooke's confirmation, Burleigh said he would bring  
``an international presence and stature to this position which will 
greatly enhance our ability to protect and promote U.S. interests 
at the U.N.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next 18 months, the United States and the United  
Nations will be watching to see whether Holbrooke achieves that 
goal.

<HEADLINE> Innocent Plea in Yosemite Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- A motel handyman pleaded innocent today to  
the murder of a Yosemite National Park naturalist who was 
decapitated as the FBI followed other leads in the slayings of 
three park sightseers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cary Stayner, who told FBI investigators he killed all four  
women, was led before a magistrate at U.S. District Court in a 
bright yellow jumpsuit, his feet and hands shackled. 
</P>
<P>
	He looked down and did not speak during the two-minute  
arraignment, avoiding the eyes of his parents, Delbert and Kay 
Stayner, who sat holding hands in the courtroom's front row. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal defender Robert Rainwater entered the plea on Stayner's  
behalf in the slaying of Joie Armstrong. Stayner was ordered back 
into the custody of U.S. marshals. He could face the death penalty 
or life without parole. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect we would be handling it like any other case, and in  
any case, there's always negotiation,'' Rainwater said when asked 
if he'd be open to a plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner himself told a TV interviewer after his confession that  
he expects to plead guilty to all four murders. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Magistrate Sandra Snyder gave the government 10 days to  
provide the defense with the evidence it has discovered against 
Stayner, and scheduled a conference for Aug. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner lived and worked at the Cedar Lodge where Carole Sund,  
her daughter Juli Sund and family friend Silvina Pelosso were last 
seen alive Feb. 15. He has not been charged in their murders, 
though he is the only suspect named by the FBI.

	``I feel very bad to just be here, and have to face this  
individual, who ... is said to be responsible for so many 
murders,'' said Ken Sund, Juli's uncle. He said the family would 
support the death penalty, and he hopes the legal process will soon 
be completed, ``so we can start to forget this person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm confident now that he's in custody, he won't be killing  
any more women in America,'' Sund said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters filled most of the available seats in the courtroom,  
and TV trucks lined up outside. In some ways, Stayner was again 
getting the publicity he first experienced when his younger 
brother, Steven, became national news 19 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven had become a hero at 14 when he escaped from a child  
molester who had kidnapped him seven years earlier, bringing with 
him as he fled a 5-year-old boy who also had been kidnapped. He 
died in a motorcycle accident in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Cary Stayner has no apparent connection to Eugene ``Rufus''  
Dykes, 32, an imprisoned convict the FBI task force relied on for 
months as it tried to solve the sightseers case. 
</P>
<P>
	Dykes told The Associated Press in a prison interview Thursday  
he had falsely implicated himself in hopes he'd get off easy on 
unrelated charges. He said he told investigators so many different 
stories that he couldn't think of any more, and agents should have 
known he was lying. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he feels sad that Ms. Armstrong was slain before FBI  
agents caught the alleged killer. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they only listened to me from the beginning,'' Dykes said.  
``I told them I didn't do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dykes was at the center of a loose-knit band of methamphetamine  
users that became the focus of investigations by the FBI-led task 
force on the sightseers' case and a federal grand jury. He had 
gotten into a standoff with police less than a month after the 
women disappeared, and was held on a parole violation.

<HEADLINE> Will AWOL Rookie Play for Vikes? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANKATO, Minn. (AP) -- Minnesota Vikings coach Dennis Green might  
not have the welcome mat out for Dimitrius Underwood if the rookie 
defensive end 
</P>
<P>
	decides to return to training camp.  
</P>
<P>
	``Once a guy walks out, I don't think you'll find another player  
on this team that can count on the guy, regardless of what the 
situation was,'' said Green, who hadn't heard from Underwood since 
his mysterious departure Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood's agent said Thursday he still didn't know where the  
AWOL rookie is hiding out, but still believes his troubled client 
will eventually return to the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, a 6-foot-6, 276-pound defensive end from Michigan  
State and the 29th pick in the NFL draft, walked out of his dorm 
and caught a cab out of town Monday, just hours after his first 
workout with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	He apologetically called his Chicago-based agent, Craig Domann,  
24 hours later, saying he'd needed to tend to a family crisis and 
was on his way back to camp to meet with Green, who would decide 
whether to take him back. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, who signed a five-year, $5.3 million contract on  
Sunday, hadn't returned by Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The team, which was able to freeze all but about $27,000 of the  
approximately $543,000 after-taxes bonus wired to Underwood's bank 
account in Milwaukee, was contemplating its next move. That could 
be anything from cutting ties to keeping him on the roster in 
either active or reserve status. 
</P>
<P>
	Domann faxed The Associated Press a statement on Thursday that  
said all attempts to locate Underwood had been fruitless. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I join everyone involved in this matter in emphasizing  
that the verification of Dimitrius' safety and well-being is of 
utmost importance,'' Domann's statement said. ``Even though the 
specific reasons for his departure are not yet known, I can assure 
you that Dimitrius would never knowingly hurt his family, coaches 
and teammates by his unexcused absence. I remain hopeful that he is 
OK and I am confident that you will see Dimitrius in camp and ready 
to play soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Domann said his client was eager to play for the Vikings, among  
the favorites for the Super Bowl this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dimitrius' dream is to play in the NFL. ... He has been  
looking forward to playing for coach Green and he has been treated 
more than fairly by the entire Vikings organization,'' Domann said. 
``I ask that coach Green and the Vikings continue to be patient and 
understanding with my client until such point when more facts 
become available.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Domann also added that ``all speculation that Dimitrius intended  
to simply take the Vikings money and not play football is totally 
inaccurate and erroneous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Domann negotiated a five-year, $5.3 million deal for Underwood  
on Sunday, including a partially deferred $1,725,000 signing bonus. 
Before taxes, Underwood got half the bonus, or $862,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Green doesn't sound like a coach willing to forgive and forget  
if Underwood does return. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody has been here long enough to understand that  
only a certain type of player can play on this football team,'' 
Green said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the embarrassed Vikings might have the league's first  
first-round bust of 1999 on their hands, Green said Underwood 
didn't deserve special recognition because of his high draft 
status. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is whether a guy is making $3 million or  
$200,000, you have to count on each other as a football team,'' 
Green said.

</P>
<P>
	Tyrone Wheatley, dropped earlier this week by the Miami  
Dolphins, is now trying to make it with the Oakland Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
	Cut by the Dolphins on Tuesday, the running back was signed by  
Oakland on Wednesday and was trying out plays with the Raiders' 
offense on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is football, at any given moment you have to be ready for  
a move,'' said Wheatley, who was traded to Miami in the offseason 
after four often-contentious years with the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheatley starred at Michigan and was the 17th pick in the 1995  
NFL draft by the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheatley will be competing for playing time with Napoleon  
Kaufman and Rashaan Salaam. All three were selected within a span 
of five picks in the 1995 draft. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Lions    	
</P>
<P>
	Ron Powlus will get another shot at becoming a Detroit Lions  
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Notre Dame signal caller, released Wednesday when the  
Lions signed Donald Hollas, was called back to training camp 
Thursday night after Hollas left without a word to coach Bobby 
Ross. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never got to see him. He just said he's lost his desire,''  
Ross said of Hollas, a former Oakland quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	Ross said his reason for cutting Powlus was that he wanted the  
opportunity to look at another quarterback, and didn't want to keep 
five in camp. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Chiefs    	
</P>
<P>
	Tight end Ted Popson, who suffered head injuries twice last  
season, obeyed his doctor's orders and announced his retirement 
from the Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Popson, 32, played two years for the Chiefs after three with the  
San Francisco 49ers. He totaled 103 catches for 980 yards and eight 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Packers    	
</P>
<P>
	Green Bay's offensive line received a blow when backup guard Joe  
Andruzzi went down holding his right knee during a drill in 
training camp Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	He was scheduled for a magnetic resonance imaging exam today,  
but judging from the time Andruzzi spent on the turf and the care 
with which the trainers removed him on a motorized cart, the 
outlook isn't good. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, we don't have any conclusive information about the  
injury,'' coach Ray Rhodes said. 
</P>
<P>
                               *Jets    	
</P>
<P>
	The Jets' right cornerback slot was effectively decided Thursday  
when veteran Otis Smith broke his left collarbone during morning 
workouts. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10th-year player, who was being pushed by Ray Mickens for a  
starting role, will be sidelined for up to seven weeks after 
suffering the injury during a passing drill. Smith, 33, fell hard 
after getting tangled with wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bill Parcells said Smith will not need surgery. He might 	
not be available, however, until the season's fourth week, when the 
Jets travel to Denver for a rematch of the AFC championship game 
with the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Titans 	
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Steve McNair returned to practice with Tennessee on  
Thursday after back spasms sidelined him for a day. 
</P>
<P>
	McNair threw the ball during both practices, but coach Jeff  
Fisher said McNair still is feeling tightness in his back. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not as sharp, not as precise as it needs to be right  
now, so he needs to get back on the field,'' Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Cowboys    	
</P>
<P>
	Dallas Cowboys receiver James McKnight injured his left knee  
during an intrasquad scrimmage Thursday night and had to helped off 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Without being hit, McKnight went down during one of the first  
plays of a goal-line drill. The team listed the injury as a sprain. 
An MRI was pending. 
</P>
<P>
	``It probably doesn't look real good,'' coach Chan Gailey said.  
</P>
<P>
	Receiver Jeff Ogden also was shaken up during the scrimmage. He  
suffered a bruised left hip and did not return. His injury did not 
appear as serious as McKnight's.

<HEADLINE> Holocaust Insurance Money Resolved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Five European insurers are seeking changes in  
a proposal for determining the current value of insurance policies 
held by Jewish victims of the Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Eagleburger, chairman of an international Holocaust-era  
insurance claims commission, was expected to take final action 
today on valuing the insurance policies. That could clear the way 
for payment of claims to begin later in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the German insurance company Allianz said all  
five European insurers, in varying degrees, are requesting 
modifications in Eagleburger's findings. 
</P>
<P>
	``The concerns are not only about the money, but about the  
process as well,'' spokesman Nicolai Tewes said Thursday in a 
telephone interview from Munich, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a misunderstanding that the companies are only  
trying to save some money,'' Tewes said. ``The companies want to 
find a process that works and makes sense to the people who are 
waiting for the money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to a participant, Eagleburger, the former secretary of  
state, decided to place a ``real value'' of about 10 times the 
prewar face value on policies issued by Allianz. 
</P>
<P>
	Eagleburger used a complex formula linked in part to long-term  
German bonds. A five-day period for registering objections ended 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Allianz spokesman declined to provide details, but offered  
assurances that ``we are still committed to the commission and we 
would like to continue to work with the commission to resolve all 
the open issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eagleburger stepped in when the commission could not agree on a  
formula to determine the current value of policies taken out some 
six decades ago. It factors in inflation and interest. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear how much money could be at stake.  
</P>
<P>
	Some European insurers have questioned the valuation formula and  
indicated they may pull out of the process. 
</P>
<P>
	``They could do whatever they want,'' Elan Steinberg, executive  
director of the World Jewish Congress, said in an interview. ``But 
the consumer and state insurance regulators would not look kindly 
to insurance companies reneging on their commitments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The next step is a meeting of the commission at the end of the  
month in London to adopt a process for compiling lists of 
policyholders and communicating with the families of the victims of 
Nazi persecution. 
</P>
<P>
	The aim is to begin payments at the end of October.  
</P>
<P>
	The commission has representatives from five major European  
companies, Jewish groups and American regulators. Earlier, they 
agreed on a formula for payment on policies issued in Eastern 
European countries.

<HEADLINE> Aetna Buys Prudential Healthcare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Aetna Inc. completed its purchase of Prudential  
Health Care on Friday to become the nation's largest health 
maintenance organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was consummated when New Jersey on Friday became the  
last state to approve the merger. As several states have done, New 
Jersey forced Aetna to meet several conditions, including promising 
to keep 90 percent of Prudential's doctors for the next three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Medical Association and physician groups nationwide  
argued the merger would create a monopoly in several cities, 
severely limiting health insurance choices for consumers and 
forcing doctors to accept lower fees. 
</P>
<P>
	The combination of Aetna and Prudential Health Care will provide  
benefits to about 22 million people nationwide. Aetna currently 
provides health insurance to about 16 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna, which has previously bought HMO companies U.S. Healthcare  
and NYLCare, becomes the nation's largest HMO with 9.7 million 
members, surpassing Kaiser Permanente's 8.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Justice Department approved the Aetna-Prudential Health  
Care merger in June. The agency required Aetna to shed some of its 
HMO operations in Houston and Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement late Friday, the AMA said the approval was  
expected, but it was pleased about some of the conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The AMA continues to be concerned that such consolidation  
further tips the balance of power to insurance companies, giving 
them too much leverage in their dealings with patients and 
physicians,'' the group said. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Aetna officials denied rumors circulated on an  
Internet chat site that it plans to buy Oxford Health Plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We note the rumors in the marketplace that Aetna is planning  
to purchase Oxford Health Plans. These rumors are not true,'' Aetna 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna said its focus is on integrating Prudential into its  
operations. Oxford officials refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Oxford, a large Northeastern health maintenance  
organization, had risen as much as 8 percent to $17.62 1/2 amid rumors 
of a potential merger, before slipping back to $16.50, up 25 cents, 
on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna's stock closed down $2.43 3/4 to $81.56 1/4 on the New York  
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Norwalk, Conn.-based Oxford is expected to become profitable  
this year after accounting problems led to millions in losses the 
past two years.

<HEADLINE> McGwire Hits 500th Home Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire needed one homer and got two to  
finish the night with 501 homers. Tony Gwynn needed two hits and 
got one, leaving him with 2,999 hits. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire reached the 500 plateau with fewer at-bats than anyone  
in baseball history, then hit No. 501 off the left-field scoreboard 
Thursday night in a 10-3 loss to the San Diego Padres on Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's incredible,'' Padres manager Bruce Bochy said. ``It's  
like he's allergic to a base hit, too. I mean, the ball's leaving 
the park every time he hits it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire made it to 500 in 5,487 at-bats, obliterating Babe  
Ruth's record of 5,801. The others in the top five are Harmon 
Killebrew (6,671), Jimmie Foxx (7,074) and Mickey Mantle (7,300). 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm well aware of the names,'' McGwire said. ``It's sort of  
odd to have your name with that group because I feel like I have a 
few years to play. I'm not done playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While McGwire became the 16th member of the 500-homer club,  
Gwynn fell just short of becoming the 22nd player to reach 3,000 
hits. Gwynn got No. 2,999 -- a two-run double in the ninth inning -- 
and went 1-for-4 with a walk as a sellout crowd just missed a 
double dose of history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I gave it a good run,'' Gwynn said. ``I'll move on to the next  
stop, and hopefully I can get it there tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres begin a four-game series at Montreal tonight.  
</P>
<P>
	Never before have two players had a chance to reach such lofty  
milestones in the same game. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people of all America got to see what they wanted to see  
and plus one,'' said Padres right-hander Andy Ashby, who gave up 
both homers. ``It would have been nice if Tony would have gotten 
his 3,000th, but we'll have to wait another day for that, or 
whenever it comes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Gwynn: ``I gave it a good run.''  
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of 45,106, some of whom paid $150 to scalpers for a $7  
standing room ticket, came away happy. After just missing in his 
first at-bat with a drive to the center-field wall, McGwire hit a 
hanging breaking ball an estimated 451 feet to straightaway center 
in the third, then blasted a 479-foot shot off the scoreboard in 
left-center in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've exceeded everything I expected of myself,'' McGwire said  
after the game. ``Growing up as a kid, you don't think about things 
like that. At least I didn't. You just think about playing ball in 
your yard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's fifth multihomer game of the season and the 58th of  
his career came in the same ballpark where he broke Roger Maris' 
37-year-old homer record last Sept. 8 when he hit No. 62. McGwire 
went on to finish with 70, ahead of Sosa's 66 in a duel that 
captivated the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire remains a bit off last year's pace, even after hitting  
17 homers in 21 games, but he's catching up in a hurry. Now he's on 
pace for 65. 
</P>
<P>
	After rounding the bases on No. 500, McGwire jumped on home  
plate with both feet before being greeted by teammates, who 
exchanged his signature fake gut punches along with high-fives. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who hit his 499th homer Wednesday night, then took his  
second curtain call in as many nights as Ashby stood off the mound, 
looking out towards center field. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn took off his glove in right field and applauded as McGwire  
rounded the bases. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm wondering, `Should I clap like everybody else or be a  
professional?''' Gwynn said. ``Really, this is his stage, his 
ballpark. Once again, he delivered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's eighth-inning blast was the longest this season at  
Busch, banging off the scoreboard near his No. 25 in a lineup list 
before dropping into the seats right above the Padres bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire leads the majors with 44 home runs, two more than Sammy  
Sosa, and tops the NL with 101 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts believe the 500th homer ball could be worth $1 million,  
and fans scrambled to come up with the prize after it deflected off 
the base of an advertisement and landed in an area of shrubbery 
beyond the center-field wall. Jim Shearer, a 28-year-old architect 
from St. Louis, wound up with the souvenir and was whisked away by 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Shearer said he'd think about what he might do with the ball for  
a few days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been hearing that it's worth a lot of money,'' Shearer  
said. ``But I have to remember it's a piece of baseball history for 
Mark McGwire and St. Louis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fan who caught McGwire's 70th homer ball, Phil Ozersky of  
St. Louis, sold it to Spawn comic book creator Todd McFarlane for 
$3.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who hit his 400th home run last season, couldn't have  
had a much better foil for his 500th. He's 8-for-16 with four 
homers and four doubles against Ashby, who congratulated him after 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, I gave up 500, so I may as well give up 501, too,''  
Ashby said. ``It's one of them things. Just thank God it wasn't 
enough to beat us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire has reached his last four big milestones, starting with  
Nos. 61, 62 and 70 last year, in front of the home fans. He wanted 
to hit No. 500 in St. Louis, too, and did it just in time -- the 
Cardinals begin a trip Friday with a doubleheader at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire also homered in his first home game after joining the  
Cardinals after the 1997 trade deadline, and in the first game 
after signing a three-year, $28.5-million deal later that year. 
That's not to mention the five homers he hit in the last three days 
of last season to pull away from Sosa. 
</P>
<P>
	``You figure out how great he is to be able to do it,'' manager  
Tony La Russa said. 
</P>
<P>
	The last player to reach 500 homers was Eddie Murray on Sept. 6,  
1996, at Baltimore against Detroit's Felipe Lira. Murray is 15th on 
the career list with 504. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire has already passed five players on the list this season  
-- Lou Gehrig (493), Stan Musial and Willie Stargell (475) and Dave 
Winfield (465). 
</P>
<P>
	Musial was at Busch Stadium for the big night and sat next to  
fellow Cardinals Hall of Famer Lou Brock, the last NL player to 
reach 3,000 hits. 
</P>
<P>
	At 35, McGwire is a year older than Ruth was when he reached  
500. He's had to make up for lost time after totaling 18 home runs 
in injury-plagued 1993 and '94 seasons for Oakland, and the homer 
put him on pace to hit 64 this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby (10-5) allowed three runs on five hits in 7 2-3 innings,  
and Trevor Hoffman finished for his 27th save. Chris Gomez and 
Hoffman drove in two runs apiece for the Padres, who won for only 
the second time in 14 games and avoided a four-game sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinals starter Larry Luebbers (1-2) lasted five innings and  
gave up four runs on five hits. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Gwynn will get his chance to become the 22nd member of the  
3,000-hit club at Montreal tonight. Dan Smith starts for the Expos. 
... Cardinals pitcher Alan Benes made his first injury rehab start 
for Double-A Arkansas and worked 1 1-3 scoreless innings against 
Shreveport, throwing 28 pitches.

<HEADLINE> Carson Back In Running for NFL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The ball appears to have taken a bounce  
toward the city of Carson in the NFL expansion franchise game. 
</P>
<P>
	With time running so short, though, Houston may soon take  
possession. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruled out by the league as a potential stadium site on April 20,  
Carson is suddenly back in the picture after negotiations focusing 
on a remodeled Los Angeles Coliseum and surrounding area as home 
for an expansion team broke down. 
</P>
<P>
	And with $180 million to dangle, Carson seems to have the public  
money the league wants to strike a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, that will satisfy the NFL,'' Carson councilman  
Daryl Sweeney said Friday -- a day after NFL commissioner Paul 
Tagliabue said stadium sites other than the Coliseum will be 
considered. ``I'm cautiously optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been privately telling people, `Never count us out.'''  
</P>
<P>
	Even so, NFL spokesman Greg Aiello acknowledged from New York  
that the Los Angeles effort is in big trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the astronauts say, `Houston, we have a problem,''' Aiello  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Interesting choice of words, since Houston is waiting in the  
wings. NFL owners decided in March to award the league's 32nd 
franchise to Los Angeles over Houston, but set a Sept. 15 deadline 
for details to be finalized. 
</P>
<P>
	That's less than six weeks away, and now it's back to first down  
and a long, long way to go. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're on a short time frame,'' Aiello admitted. ``We've got a  
commitment to Houston to make a decision in Los Angeles by Sept. 
15, and then give Houston a chance. And we will honor our 
commitment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As far as Carson and other venues might be concerned, Aiello  
said, ``It depends on their interest more than ours. We can't do it 
by ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sticking point in negotiations with the Coliseum was over  
public money. The NFL wants it but the state is against it and so, 
too, is the citizenry, according to at least one survey. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a poll released Friday by the Howard Jarvis  
Taxpayers Association, 80 percent of California voters oppose using 
public money to help bring an expansion franchise to Los Angeles, 
and only 14 percent approve. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's survey should be a wakeup call to the NFL and its  
owners,'' Los Angeles councilman Joel Wachs said. ``Los Angeles 
taxpayers are not going to cave in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Billionaire Eli Broad, co-leader of the Coliseum group vying for  
the expansion franchise, proposed some public funding in a letter 
to Tagliabue earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The league hasn't responded.  
</P>
<P>
	Ron Hartwig, a spokesman for Broad, said Broad and partner Ed  
Roski Jr., remain firmly committed to the Coliseum as a site for 
NFL football. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've put out a proposal that they believe will be  
attractive to the NFL,'' Hartwig said. ``It deserves debate and a 
hard looking-at before anybody suggests it can't be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roski said the Coliseum effort is definitely not dead.  
</P>
<P>
	``No way,'' he said. ``Every process has its ups and downs.''  
</P>
<P>
	Roski said he realizes public money isn't available, but that  
it's not needed in this case, mainly because the new parking 
structures the NFL wants in the area aren't necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can empty the stadium and get everyone on their way today  
in 20 minutes,'' he said. ``With a parking structure, you can't get 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NFL has to sit down with us, they've got to understand  
that we don't need it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the governmental Coliseum Commission announced it  
will meet in special session Monday to discuss what to do next. 
</P>
<P>
	Former entertainment executive Michael Ovitz originally headed  
up the Carson project before working with Broad and Roski to come 
up with a stadium design and financial plan for the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't fly, so now Ovitz might be back in business.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's an ongoing dialogue with the NFL,'' was the only  
comment Ovitz spokesman Peter Levin would make Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael's attorney called me today, basically reopening the  
lines of communication,'' Sweeney said. ``He also said they need to 
get direction from the league before they have serious dialogue 
with us. I believe we'll hear from them in a matter of days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another potential site is at Hollywood Park in Inglewood, where  
billionaire Marvin Davis took an option on nearly 100 acres if the 
NFL shifted its focus from the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	Other possibilities in the area are alongside Dodger Stadium  
close to downtown, and Anaheim or Irvine in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
	``Irvine's always been in the picture,'' said Anthony Davis, a  
former star running back at USC and now spokesman for the Irvine 
project. ``The thing in Irvine is it can be done privately. It's a 
viable project. It's the best site in the United States, completely 
privately funded. That's the only way it's going to happen, in 
California especially.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said he couldn't reveal other names involved in the Irvine  
project at this time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles area has been without an NFL team since the  
Raiders moved to Oakland and the Rams moved from Anaheim to St. 
Louis before the 1995 season.

<HEADLINE> Steelers Injury Toll Climbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LATROBE, Pa. (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Steelers' injury toll has  
reached eight starters, with fullback Jon Witman the latest 
casualty. 
</P>
<P>
	Witman, who replaced Tim Lester as the Steelers' top blocking  
back, has had chronic back problems in recent years and woke up 
with back spasms Friday. He watched morning practice from the 
sideline and didn't hit the field at all for the afternoon session. 
</P>
<P>
	But if Steelers coach Bill Cowher is even the least bit  
concerned about the club's injury situation, he didn't show it at 
the end of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a few guys not out here working, that's for sure,''  
Cowher said. ``I think if we had to play this week that Dewayne 
Washington and Travis Davis could play. And I'm sure Wayne (Gandy) 
would play, but it isn't the middle of the season. So, you have to 
look at it accordingly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Steelers' starting lineup has been nearly cut in half, with  
center Dermontti Dawson, running back Jerome Bettis, Witman, 
offensive guard Brenden Stai, offensive tackle Wayne Gandy, 
cornerback Dewayne Washington, defensive end Nolan Harrison and 
free safety Travis Davis relegated to watching from the sideline 
with various nagging injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Huntley, the backup to Bettis, has been getting  
repetitions at fullback, which could help his standing by the time 
the regular season begins. Orpheus Roye, expected to push Kevin 
Henry for a defensive end spot, has been playing well in place of 
Harrison. And rookie Scott Shields, the Steelers' No. 2 draft pick, 
has replaced Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure some young guys have to push through it,'' Cowher  
said about the difficulty of going through two-a-day practices. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure that everybody's sore, but you have to recognize the  
difference between somebody being hurt -- which we'd never ask 
somebody to play hurt -- and working through the pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some young guys have to differentiate between the two, and  
some guys are fighting for positions,'' Cowher said. ``The more 
you're not out there, the more you're giving somebody else the 
chance to seize a job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dawson appears to be better every day, while Stai, Washington,  
Davis and Gandy are likely to return next week. Harrison is a week 
away, while Bettis said he wanted to be back by the end of the 
month. Witman also was expected to return sometime next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Other injured players are rookie offensive tackle Kris Farris,  
rookie tight end Jerame Tuman and rookie linebacker Bobbie Cotten. 
Cotten could be back on the field next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The three are missing an important rookie scrimmage against  
Washington on Saturday in Frostburg, Md. Cowher believed that only 
selected starters would play, like Huntley and Shields, while Roye 
might get a rest with the other veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, Cowher was in a better mood after Friday's practice  
sessions. He was displeased with the team's workout Thursday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was much better,'' Cowher said. ``We had two very good  
sessions. We get a chance to go against the Redskins (Saturday), 
and then they'll get Sunday off. But we responded very well. ... It 
was a good, crisp practice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The scrimmage basically ends training camp because the Steelers  
go into a game-week mode beginning Monday. Their first preseason 
game is next Friday night against Chicago at Three Rivers Stadium.

<HEADLINE> BP Amoco Acknowledges Cancer Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAPERVILLE, Ill. (AP) -- BP Amoco health officials have  
acknowledged that six employees probably got deadly brain cancer 
from their work in one wing of the company's sprawling research 
center in suburban Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers representing a number of former Amoco employees or their  
survivors offered a mixture of frustration and hope -- but no 
surprise -- after Thursday's acknowledgement. 
</P>
<P>
	But the three-year study by investigators from the University of  
Alabama at Birmingham and Johns Hopkins University that points to a 
job-related pattern for those men also dismisses any work 
connection for more than a dozen other employees stricken with 
different tumors, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is part of their legal strategy to excise the cases  
they think are the strongest and to divide and conquer,'' attorney 
Grant Thornton said Friday. He represents six former Amoco 
employees, but not any who are the focus of the company's 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Other attorneys also suggested the company was dragging its feet  
because it is reluctant to admit responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they're concluding about the (brain cancer) cases is  
probably less strong than what my experts concluded a year ago,'' 
said attorney Marios Karayannis, whose father Nick was among the 
Amoco researchers killed by a malignant head tumor. 
</P>
<P>
	Karayannis and another attorney said the company may be moving  
toward settling the cases involving the six men. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to go talk to those families and find out what  
they need,'' Amoco spokeswoman Vicki J. Kastory said Thursday. ``We 
are going to share their financial burden. What I don't know is 
what that means in terms of dollars and cents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kastory said the company would not comment further on the  
lawsuits, and another spokeswoman did not return a telephone call 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten lawsuits have been filed against the company on behalf of 21  
people, some with malignant brain tumors, others with non-cancerous 
tumors in their heads and still others with different types of 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuits allege workers were exposed to numerous neurotoxins  
-- elements that poison the central nervous system -- because of 
inadequate ventilation and lax safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1989, 20 center workers have been diagnosed with benign  
and malignant brain tumors; 14 worked in the chemical research 
complex on the center's sprawling campus. The six with glioma all 
worked within that complex, and most worked on the same floor in 
building 503. Five of the men have died. 
</P>
<P>
	The glioma rate in building 503 is eight times the national  
average. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco has spent millions investigating and hiring experts to  
determine what, if anything, in the workplace caused these tumors.

<HEADLINE> 4 Die in Small Plane Crash in Ill. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAYSLAKE, Ill. (AP) -- A single-engine plane clipped a power  
line on its approach to a suburban Chicago airport and plunged into 
a field, killing all four people on board. 
</P>
<P>
	The man at the controls was an experienced pilot, Lake County  
Coroner Barbara Richardson said. Authorities said he had taken two 
men and a woman on a 3 1/2-hour excursion flight and was returning to 
Campbell Airport when the Piper Arrow crashed Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Identities of the victims were withheld pending notification of  
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash downed power lines, delaying emergency crews trying to  
reach the scene, Grayslake Fire Department Capt. Pete Novak said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lake County Sheriff's Department referred questions about  
the crash to the National Transportation Safety Board. Calls to the 
NTSB this morning were not immediately returned.

<HEADLINE> AOL Adds to Messenger Distribution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DULLES, Va. (AP) -- America Online Inc. will make its Instant  
Messenger service easily available to the 2.5 million customers of 
two smaller Internet access services, further defying Microsoft 
Corp.'s attempt to crack AOL's lock on the market for real-time 
notes. 
</P>
<P>
	The move Friday drew a sharp reaction from Microsoft, which is  
promoting its own instant messaging service but has been rebuffed 
so far in getting AOL to let customers of both services exchange 
messages. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too bad that AOL continues to advance their own separate  
efforts and is not listening to consumers' desires for 
interoperability between messenger services,'' Microsoft 
spokeswoman Deanna Sanford said. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL, based in Dulles, Va., announced Friday it would distribute  
its messaging service through MindSpring Enterprises and Earthlink 
Network, the first time its popular service has been available 
through another Internet service provider. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft attempted to gain  
access for its MSN customers to AOL's Instant Messenging users. But 
AOL built a digital firewall to keep MSN users out, citing security 
concerns. Microsoft is trying to work around the blockade. 
</P>
<P>
	By adding new users in Friday's deal, AOL creates an even more  
formidable presence in the budding market. AOL has 43 million users 
of its messaging service. Its deal with MindSpring and Earthlink 
will enable users to sign up for the service immediately upon going 
online, instead of clicking their way to AOL's site. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doing deals with other ISPs is a way of including other  
vendors in the market but keeping a hold on their control of 
Instant Messenging and ensuring that the AOL brand continues to 
dominate,'' said Mark Levitt, an analyst at the International Data 
Corp. research firm, in Framingham, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Instant messaging itself is not a money maker, Levitt said, but  
it is a way of attracting customers to other Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's capturing customers and making the customer spend time at  
the respective Microsoft or AOL sites,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL says it hopes to reach agreements with other small ISPs to  
include them in its instant messaging ``family'' and would be 
willing to include Microsoft, but only on AOL's terms.

<HEADLINE> Innocent Plea in Yosemite Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- A motel handyman pleaded innocent Friday  
to the murder of a Yosemite National Park naturalist who was 
decapitated. 
</P>
<P>
	The plea from Cary Stayner came as the FBI chased leads in the  
February slayings of three park sightseers. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner told investigators he killed all four women but has been  
charged only in the July 21 slaying of Joie Armstrong, who led 
outdoor education programs in the park. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner, who turns 38 next week, could face the death penalty or  
life in prison without parole in Armstrong's death. Another hearing 
before U.S. Magistrate Sandra Snyder was scheduled for Aug. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner lived and worked at the Cedar Lodge where Carole Sund,  
her daughter Juli Sund and family friend Silvina Pelosso were last 
seen alive Feb. 15. He is the only suspect identified by the FBI in 
their slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner's brother, Steven, became national news 19 years ago  
when at 14 he escaped from a child molester who had kidnapped him 
seven years earlier. He brought with him a 5-year-old boy who also 
had been kidnapped. Steven died in a motorcycle accident in 1989.

<HEADLINE>  Worry About Attacks on Peacekeepers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Violent flare-ups involving NATO  
troops injured a Russian soldier and an ethnic Albanian and 
prompted a peacekeeping spokesman to express concern today about 
attacks on Kosovo peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence overnight included three attacks on Russian  
soldiers at checkpoints in eastern Kosovo, an exchange of gunfire 
with people trying to attack a Serb home in the southern city of 
Urosevac, and three cases in which shots were fired at other NATO 
checkpoints or patrols. 
</P>
<P>
	One Russian soldier was wounded in the thigh, and an ethnic  
Albanian was seriously injured in the incidents. NATO forces 
detained a total of 15 suspects, said Maj. Jan Joosten, spokesman 
for the peacekeeping force in Pristina known as KFOR. 
</P>
<P>
	``KFOR is very concerned about the current attacks against its  
soldiers,'' Joosten said, adding that the rules of engagement allow 
the foreign troops a robust response to any attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence came amid a series of attacks on minority Serbs by  
ethnic Albanians. More than 160,000 Serbs have fled the province as 
a result, and Belgrade has protested that the NATO forces are 
failing to protect both sides equally. 
</P>
<P>
	Joosten said the security situation in Kosovo was generally  
better, but he acknowledged the overnight violence marked an 
increase in incidents involving peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	In the incidents listed by Joosten:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Unidentified assailants attacked three Russian checkpoints in  
Koretin and Kosovska Kamenica, driving a vehicle into one of them 
and firing shots at two others. Ethnic Albanians in the eastern 
region have been protesting the presence of Russian troops, whom 
they consider to be sympathetic toward the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Troops protecting a Serb house in Urosevac exchanged fire with  
attackers in a white station wagon, and a U.S. Apache helicopter 
followed the vehicle. One wounded man was arrested at Pristina 
hospital, where the car was found. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Shots were fired above a checkpoint in southern Kosovo near  
Prizren, and an ethnic Albanian was arrested after weapons were 
found in his car. NATO has forbidden Kosovars from being armed. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A patrol in Pec, in western Kosovo, came under fire and one  
suspect was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Shots were fired near a checkpoint in the southwestern  
Djakovica area, and the search of a nearby house turned up an 
assault rifle and a grenade. The occupant was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence is considered a threat to the ability of NATO and  
the United Nations to set up a civil administration in Kosovo to 
run the territory until elections can be held. 
</P>
<P>
	Nadia Younes, the U.N. spokeswoman in Pristina, said today that  
a transition council of ethnic Albanians and Serbs set up to form 
new governing structures would probably hold its second meeting 
sometime in mid-August. 
</P>
<P>
	She said ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova and Hashim Thaci,  
the former guerrilla leader who heads an interim administration in 
Kosovo, had met with U.N. mission chief Bernard Kouchner for more 
than three hours this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Rugova and Thaci indicated they would join the council  
meeting, Younes said. Rugova's party boycotted the first meeting 
last month, complaining it lacked proper representation. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.N. refugee agency said today it resolved a  
dispute with Macedonian authorities over a $2,450 inspection fee 
charged trucks transporting humanitarian aid to Kosovo. The U.N. 
had held back hundreds of trucks in Macedonia's capital, Skopje, 
while trying to resolve the issue this week, spokesman Ron Redmond 
said.

said.

<HEADLINE> TNN: Country Music to Wrestling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- What does pickin' and grinnin' have in common  
with bone-jarring wrestling? We're about to find out. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nashville Network joins the professional wrestling party  
later this month, after agreeing with the producers of Extreme 
Championship Wrestling to air a one-hour weekly series. It 
premieres Aug. 27 at 8 p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	This intriguing deal is a window into the malleability of a  
television network enticed by something hot, and seems certain to 
mobilize critics who worry about the effects of this entertainment 
on children. 
</P>
<P>
	For three years, ECW producers tried without success to interest  
TNN in a wrestling series, said Steve Karel, the organization's 
managing director. 
</P>
<P>
	It seemed like a natural fit: TNN was popular in the rural  
South, and that's where ECW had most of its fans. The Nashville 
Network clung to its country music roots, but eventually couldn't 
help seeing what wrestling was doing for TNT and the USA network. 
</P>
<P>
	World Wrestling Federation and World Championship Wrestling  
shows are routinely among the highest-rated cable programs each 
week. Pro wrestling is a cultural phenomenon with young men and 
boys, an audience that TV advertisers crave and find difficult to 
reach. 
</P>
<P>
	TNN's corporate parent, CBS, has already demonstrated its  
eagerness to reach this demographic by giving Howard Stern a weekly 
show through the company's syndication arm. 
</P>
<P>
	The fit suddenly seemed more natural.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think a network like TNN, even a year ago, would have  
touched this,'' said Dave Meltzer, editor of the Wrestling Observer 
newsletter. ``The WWF has in some ways changed what has become 
acceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TNN had been showing demolition derbies on Friday nights, then  
in January successfully paired that with an up-to-date, crunching 
version of roller derby. Wrestling will be the third show in that 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	ECW depicts itself as an innovator in the entertaining,  
story-based form of professional wrestling. Yet because it has been 
seen only on pay-per-view events or in syndication, it doesn't have 
the high profile of its two competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some ways it's more extreme than the WWF and in some ways  
it's less. It's just different,'' Meltzer said. ``I would say it's 
heavier on the violence than the WWF and lower on the perversion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Hall, TNN president, said he wants a show that will put  
more emphasis on wrestling, and less on outside-the-ring dramas. 
</P>
<P>
	TNN will air a show with a ``consumer-friendly, mainstream  
approach,'' he said. Some of the more extreme antics that are shown 
in a pay-per-view special won't fly on basic cable, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like the phrase `tone down,''' ECW's Karel said. ``I'd  
like to use the phrase `focusing on the action inside the ring.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have questioned whether wrestling is a harmful  
influence on young people. Dallas police this spring issued a 
warning to parents and youngsters following the accidental death of 
a 3-year-old boy at the hands of an older brother who was imitating 
a wrestling move he'd seen on TV. Wrestling officials deflect 
responsibility, saying it's up to parents to watch what their 
children are doing. 
</P>
<P>
	As is almost predictable when something is successful,  
television may soon face a wrestling glut. The struggling UPN 
broadcast network will introduce its own wrestling show in the 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	TNN will give its show a TV-14 rating, setting itself up to walk  
the same fine line as Comedy Central does with ``South Park.'' Both 
are presented to the public as for adults, yet they're very 
adolescent in their appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not something for your kids,'' Meltzer said, ``and at 8  
p.m., it's going to be viewed by kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wrestling is one part of an effort by TNN to broaden its appeal.  
Another subtle indicator: It refers to itself as TNN, instead of 
The Nashville Network, so as not to turn off people who don't like 
country music. ``We're looking at more of an approach toward 
Americana than country right at this second,'' Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't necessarily mean TNN will stand for extreme sports  
more than it does country music. Then again, if the wrestling 
ratings go through the roof ... 
</P>
<P>
	``You can do too much too soon,'' Hall said. ``I think we're  
planning on Friday night as the right place. But we'll see what 
happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ...  
</P>
<P>
	JFK Jr. COVERAGE: Statistics show how adept news shows are  
becoming at saturation coverage during big stories. The network's 
evening newsmagazines gave the same intense coverage during the 
week after John F. Kennedy Jr. died in a plane crash as they did 
the week after Princess Diana died, according to a study by the 
Lawrence, Kansas-based NewsTV Corp. The Kennedy story received 47 
of 71, or 66 percent, of the segments on the newsmagazines. It was 
a nearly identical 67 percent the week after Diana died. Morning 
news shows devoted 64 percent of their segments to Kennedy between 
July 19 and 23.

<HEADLINE> McGwire's 500th Ball Future Unknown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- When Jim Shearer walked into work Friday, he  
ignored the plans sitting on his desk. Whoever is waiting on the 
28-year-old architect to finish the design of a balcony at a 
high-end housing project will have to wait. 
</P>
<P>
	So, apparently, will baseball fans who want to know what Shearer  
plans to do with his excuse for slacking off on the job: Mark 
McGwire's 500th home run ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've thought about it,'' Shearer offered. ``I guess I'll sell  
it, keep it or give it to the Hall of Fame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That just about covers all of Shearer's options. Everyone who's  
waiting for him and his wife Jennifer to pick will have to, well, 
just keep on waiting, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no drop-dead date yet,'' Shearer said. ``I want to  
think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the part of history Shearer grabbed last night in the  
left-center field stands at Busch Stadium is tucked away in a safe 
deposit box deep inside the Bank of America Tower in downtown St. 
Louis. Baseball experts said it might be worth $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Shearer and his wife will take a few days to ponder the future  
of their souvenir from Thursday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Memorabilia broker Michael Barnes said that's exactly what the  
Shearers should do. It might sound like odd advice from the man who 
has already offered a $100,000 advance for the ball. But Barnes, 
who helped 26-year-old Washington University researcher Phil 
Ozersky sell McGwire's 70th home run ball, is in no hurry to start 
the bidding. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted me to come up there with one of those big checks  
and do a real hard sell,'' Barnes said. He declined, and will wait 
for Shearer to call. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears he's doing the right thing, which is taking his  
time,'' Barnes said. ``He's going to be in for some busy days. I 
know he knows who I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Shearer does decide he wants to sell the ball, he can't wait  
too long. To fetch the best price, Barnes said Friday he'd like to 
sell the ball at an auction he has planned for Oct. 13. The ball 
should definitely reach the market before Christmas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There really haven't been too many calls from people who want  
to buy the ball,'' Shearer said. ``But I haven't been home to check 
my messages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Almost as important as when to sell might be to whom to sell. ,  
Barnes said he has been contacted by several bidders, including 
some who bid on No. 70 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big issue right now is will those companies that were  
interested in No. 70 think about using this ball to sell a 
product,'' Barnes said. ``If those kinds of bidders become 
involved, it really will drive the price through the roof.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the student loans Shearer said he's suddenly thinking a  
lot more about since Thursday night, there is the prospect that he 
won't call Barnes or any other dealer. Friday, he said he was 
giving serious thought to keeping the ball himself, or giving it 
back to McGwire. McGwire said after Thursday's game the ball 
belonged at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I don't sell it, I'll probably hold on to it for a while,''  
Shearer said. ``Even then, I think it might end up there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And while he's thinking about it, no one will bother him about  
the plans for that balcony. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of crazy here today,'' Shearer said. ``They say  
they're getting some work done. But not as much as usual.''

<HEADLINE> Deadline for Boeing 737 Repairs Met </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's airlines finished replacing  
rudder pieces in Boeing 737s this week that had been linked to two 
airplane crashes and a third near-crash. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Wednesday's deadline, airlines had replaced the rudder  
power control unit in 1,122 of 1,139 airplanes covered by an order 
issued by the Federal Aviation Administration. The agency said the 
remaining 17 are not in revenue service, most in heavy maintenance. 
The part is being replaced during that work. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the FAA issued an airworthiness directive requiring  
U.S. airlines to replace rudder power control units after an 
investigation into the 1994 crash of a USAir Boeing 737 outside 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	The twin-engine jetliner is the world's most commonly used  
commercial aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, the National Transportation Safety Board concluded  
that the USAir crash, as well as the 1991 crash of a United 
Airlines 737 near Colorado Springs, Colo., and a 1996 incident in 
which the pilots of an Eastwind Airlines 737 momentarily lost 
control on the aircraft's approach at Richmond, Va., were probably 
caused by a jam in the airplane's PCUs. 
</P>
<P>
	The USAir crash killed 132, the United crash 25.  
</P>
<P>
	The power control unit is a soda can-sized hydraulic valve used  
to move the rudder. That panel runs up the back of the plane's tail 
and sweeps the nose left and right. Rudders are primarily used to 
compensate when an aircraft loses thrust in one engine or when it 
is landing in a crosswind. 
</P>
<P>
	The replacement part is designed to prevent a jam.  
</P>
<P>
	The safety board said in March it does not believe the 737's  
rudder system is ``reliably redundant'' even with the new part, so 
it asked Boeing, the FAA and a group of engineers to study the 
problem further. 
</P>
<P>
	The replacement work was a particular challenge for Southwest  
Airlines, a discount carrier with an all-737 fleet. The airline had 
257 planes affected by the order; its newest planes were built with 
the redesigned PCU. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes very careful planning, but that's the system we  
use,'' said Southwest spokeswoman Beth Harbin. ``We don't have the 
luxury of being able to take an aircraft out of service for a 
week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing spokesman Eric Dixon said 1,686 airplanes are in service  
elsewhere in the world that would fall under the scope of the FAA's 
order. The agency lacks the authority to order fixes on those 
airplanes, but in many cases foreign civil aviation authorities 
follow the agency's advice on safety matters.

<HEADLINE> France Bank Battle Nearing End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Open warfare among France's banking titans drew to  
a close Friday as investors scrambled to make decisions that would 
profoundly transform the country's traditionally sedate financial 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	While all sides were predicting victory Friday, the outcome is  
far from clear in the five-month takeover battle, which pits Banque 
Nationale de Paris, or BNP, against Societe Generale and Paribas. 
</P>
<P>
	A merger of the three banks would create the world's first $1  
trillion bank in terms of assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Stockholders had until Friday midnight (6 p.m. EDT) to pledge  
their shares to rival plans by BNP and Societe Generale, which both 
aim to create a global banking giant. But even after the vote 
closes, French banking authorities won't announce the results until 
Aug. 17, at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the outcome, France's banking sector -- which has long  
remained on the sidelines of a worldwide wave of consolidation -- 
will likely emerge with new international clout. 
</P>
<P>
	``The winner will play a leading role in European banking  
consolidation,'' said Bernard de Longevialle, banking analyst at 
Standard &AMP; Poor's in Paris. ``Compared to its neighbors, France has 
lagged behind -- now, we will have an opportunity to improve banking 
profits and competitiveness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The takeover fight began in March when BNP trumped a friendly  
merger between Societe Generale and Paribas, offering $37 billion 
for the two banks. Societe Generale and Paribas rejected BNP's 
surprise offer and have spurned its advances since then. 
</P>
<P>
	If BNP's offer for shares in Societe Generale and Paribas  
succeeds in gaining more than 50 percent of both companies, the 
battle will be over and its three-way merger can proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	If BNP fails to gain control on both fronts, its two targets can  
proceed with their own $18.8 billion cash and stock merger. 
</P>
<P>
	The outcome, however, might not be that simple.  
</P>
<P>
	Analysts predict that BNP will likely win control of Paribas,  
but that it could fall short on Societe Generale, a result that 
could disappoint all parties. 
</P>
<P>
	Such an outcome, which would leave either BNP or Societe  
Generale isolated, might force them to consider cross-border 
alliances, an option the French government has discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
	French regulators have said they would step in if a clear  
majority doesn't emerge from one or all of the competing bids. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities, including Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn,  
are said to favor BNP's three-way plan because it would discourage 
a takeover by a foreign bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Societe Generale is the largest private-sector bank in France,  
with assets of about $412 billion, and BNP is No. 2 at about $349 
billion. Parabas has assets of about $284 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides have spent millions of dollars promoting their plans  
with dueling full-page newspaper advertisements at home and abroad, 
evidence that the stakes are high. 
</P>
<P>
	BNP's hostile raid is one of several corporate battles that have  
recently shaken the normally clubby European business world, 
setting the stage for further restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, Italy's Olivetti succeeded in its upstart bid for the  
much larger Telecom Italia, defeating a rival bid by Germany's 
Deutsche Telekom. 
</P>
<P>
	More recently, French oil companies Elf and TotalFina have been  
locked in a takeover battle since TotalFina launched a hostile 
$42.8 billion takeover bid for its rival in July. Elf countered 
with an offer of nearly $51 billion for TotalFina. 
</P>
<P>
	The flurry of dealmaking shows how rapidly the corporate  
environment is changing in the aftermath of the January launch of 
the European common currency, the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	BNP Chairman Michel Pebereau said Friday his bank will acquire  
more than 50 percent of the investment bank Paribas and ``effective 
control'' of rival Societe Generale, thus assuring his plan of 
creating SBP. 
</P>
<P>
	The heads of Paribas and Societe Generale retort that their  
friendly merger plan is sure to succeed because BNP won't garner 
complete control of Societe Generale. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bank of the future is the bank that can be a leader in  
Tokyo, New York and Frankfurt ... it's the bank that will be the 
same size as Chase, UBS, Deutsche Bank -- it's SG-Paribas,'' Paribas 
Chairman Andre Levy-Lang proclaimed on French radio Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, France's stock market regulators warned Friday that  
investors shouldn't give credence to the banking groups' victory 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone wants to have their say on the deal because it is  
such a large operation,'' said S&AMP;P's de Longevialle. ``But in the 
end, the markets will have to decide.''

<HEADLINE> Financier Keating Wins Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Charles Keating, a central figure in the  
1980s savings and loan scandal, has scored a largely symbolic 
victory in federal court: reversal of a $4.3 billion award in favor 
of the government. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was the largest judgment ever entered against an  
individual in our judicial system, and it's terrific that it's been 
thrown out,'' Keating's lawyer, Stephen Neal, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Keating, former chief executive of Lincoln Savings &AMP; Loan, was  
ordered by a judge in 1994 to pay the massive award to the 
Resolution Trust Corp., which took over Lincoln after its downfall. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Richard Bilby of Arizona ruled in the RTC's  
favor without a trial, saying Keating's mismanagement and 
defrauding of Lincoln were established by his criminal convictions 
for defrauding investors, and a $1.5 billion damage award in a 
separate suit by investors in Lincoln's parent company. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Friday that the  
RTC must prove its case at trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling is largely symbolic because Keating didn't have the  
money to pay the judgment in the first place, said Neal. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the RTC could take its suit to trial but would have a  
hard time because ``it was a dubious case to begin with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Manning, a lawyer for the government, did not return a  
telephone call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Keating was initially convicted in federal court of defrauding  
Lincoln and its investors, and sentenced to 12 1/2 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	But a federal judge later overturned the criminal convictions,  
and Keating pleaded guilty this April to reduced charges that freed 
him after less than five years in prison. Another judge overturned 
Keating's separate California criminal convictions, a ruling that 
prosecutors are appealing. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th Circuit said the charges that Keating admitted in April  
-- wire fraud and concealment of assets -- were unrelated to the 
RTC's claims against him.

<HEADLINE> Passenger Detained for Expired Visa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A Turkish man taken off a Delta Air Lines flight  
to Istanbul and then detained for an expired visa was released and 
allowed to return home. Upon arrival today at the airport in 
Turkey, though, the man was detained again. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigation produced no criminal charges against Hakan  
Caglar, who left Atlanta on Thursday bound for Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	He arrived in Istanbul today, only to be detained again by  
authorities. Turkish officials gave no reason for holding the man. 
</P>
<P>
	Caglar, 35, drew the suspicion of authorities Tuesday at the  
Valdosta airport after he retrieved his luggage from a U-Haul truck 
and paid cash for a one-way ticket to Istanbul, with a change of 
planes in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI said at the time they received a tip that Caglar was ``a  
potential threat to national security.'' All 217 passengers on the 
flight were taken off the plane for a security check and five 
seated near Caglar were questioned. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI spokeswoman Celestine Armstead refused to say what agents  
suspected he might have done. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not embarrassed at all,'' she said. ``We stand firmly  
behind what we did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Caglar, who had been in the United States since March 7, was  
detained until Thursday by the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service because his visa expired June 6.

<HEADLINE> Life Savers' Reconsidering Flavors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In the latest food fight, pineapple is battling  
watermelon and strawberry to retain its venerable place in the Life 
Savers candy roll. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers will determine by a vote whether pineapple-flavored  
Life Savers candies are dropped from the original five-flavor 
lineup that has been in place since 1935. 
</P>
<P>
	The other four flavors -- cherry, lemon, lime and orange -- will  
be unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Life Savers do come in several varieties, from mints to tropical  
fruits. But pineapple is only included in the five-flavor original. 
</P>
<P>
	Company research shows pineapple is the least popular flavor,  
John Barrows, a spokesman for Nabisco Holdings Corp.'s Life Savers 
division, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decision came out of just looking at that particular  
product line. The five-flavor roll is one of oldest and most famous 
products we have. We haven't done anything to update it for a long 
time,'' he said. ``But sometimes the worst thing you can do is 
change things. So we'll let consumers decide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of the candies have been ``respectable, but now what we  
want them to be,'' Barrows said. He did not have exact figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Votes will be tallied in late December and the results released  
early next year, Barrows said. According to early results on the 
Web site, watermelon was leading strawberry by a slight margin. 
</P>
<P>
	Life Savers mints were introduced in 1912 by a chocolate maker  
who wanted a candy he could sell in the hot summer, Barrows said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wanting to differentiate from other mints, most of which were  
square in those days, he used a pill-making machine to make 
circular shaped candy mints and cut a hole in the center, he said. 
He thought they looked like little life preservers, so he called 
them Life Savers. 
</P>
<P>
	He sold the brand a few years later; Nabisco acquired it in the  
early 1980s, Barrows said.

<HEADLINE> Holtz, Gamecocks Hit Practice Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Lou Holtz took the practice field for the  
first time in three seasons Friday, drilling the freshmen who carry 
the hopes of South Carolina fans praying the famed coach can pull 
off one more miracle. 
</P>
<P>
	Holtz was hired in December. He's spent the past nine months  
lifting the attitudes of Gamecock players, officials and fans 
trying to forget last season's school-worst 1-10 record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel fine, I didn't drop a pass, I didn't make a mistake,''  
Holtz said. ``I just sort of observed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has told South Carolina students that the least they should  
expect in four years is one Southeastern Conference title and one 
national title. Now, Holtz starts the real work of fulfilling the 
promises. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this group of young men has a chance to help us. It's  
a very impressive group considering the late start we got,'' Holtz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	His class, which includes Mr. Football in South Carolina,  
tailback Derek Watson, and Mr. Football in Ohio, runner Ryan 
Brewer, strode onto the practice field with their names taped to 
the front of their white helmets after a morning of physical tests. 
</P>
<P>
	When Holtz wasn't coaching, he strolled throughout the fields,  
shaking hands with recruits and chatting with about 100 people who 
came to watch. 
</P>
<P>
	It's far too soon -- the veterans don't show up until Sunday -- to  
project where the new players fit in Holtz's puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
	The dismissal of leading rusher Troy Hambrick leaves a hole in  
the depth chart that could be filled by Watson, the state's 
all-time prep rushing leader with 6,759 yards.

<HEADLINE> Nixon's Final Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Events in the spring and summer of 1974 leading to Richard  
Nixon's resignation as president: 
</P>
<P>
	May 24: Watergate special prosecutor Leon Jaworsky asks the  
Supreme Court to rule on his subpoena for 64 tape recordings of 
President Nixon's conversations. In April, the president's lawyers 
had released 1,254 pages of edited transcripts of other tapes. 
</P>
<P>
	June 10: Nixon tells the House Judiciary Committee he won't give  
it any more Watergate evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	June 27: Nixon lawyer James St. Clair tells the Judiciary  
Committee the president had no advance knowledge of the Watergate 
break-in and was not involved in trying to cover it up. 
</P>
<P>
	July 11: House Judiciary Committee releases eight volumes of  
evidence on the president's role in the Watergate affair. 
</P>
<P>
	July 13: Senate Watergate Committee releases three-volume final  
report. It avoids saying whether Nixon participated in the cover-up 
and is adopted unanimously. 
</P>
<P>
	July 24: The Supreme Court rules 8-0 the president must turn  
over the tapes; the Judiciary Committee begins impeachment debate 
carried live on television, following 10 weeks of testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	July 27: The House Judiciary Committee passes the first article  
of impeachment, 27-11, accusing Nixon of obstructing justice. He is 
in California, swimming in the Pacific, when vote is taken. 
</P>
<P>
	July 29: The committee passes the second impeachment article,  
28-10, accusing Nixon of abusing power. 
</P>
<P>
	July 30: Third article of impeachment passes, 21-17, accusing  
Nixon of unconstitutionally defying the committee's subpoenas. 
Nixon turns over 11 of the 64 tapes. 
</P>
<P>
	Aug. 2: Nixon surrenders 13 more tapes, a batch that will seal  
his fate. 
</P>
<P>
	Aug. 3-4: Nixon retreats with his family to Camp David and  
summons aides to prepare for the public release of tape 
transcripts. 
</P>
<P>
	Aug. 5: The White House releases transcripts of three taped  
conversations, among the 13 delivered the previous Friday. They 
contain the ``smoking gun'' tying Nixon to obstruction of justice, 
showing that on June 23, 1972, six days after the break-in at 
Democratic National Committee offices at the Watergate, he tried to 
get the CIA to halt the FBI's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Aug. 6: In a final gesture of defiance, Nixon tells his Cabinet  
he won't resign, as his remaining support in Congress melts. 
</P>
<P>
	Aug. 7: Republican Sens. Barry Goldwater of Arizona and Hugh  
Scott of Pennsylvania and Republican Rep. John J. Rhodes of 
Arizona, the House minority leader, meet Nixon to discuss the 
liklihood he will be convicted if impeached and subjected to Senate 
trial. ``It sounds damn gloomy,'' Nixon says. Goldwater says it's 
hopeless. Nixon tells his family and chief of staff he's resigning. 
</P>
<P>
	Aug. 8: At 9 p.m., Nixon tells the nation in a TV address that  
he will resign the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	Aug. 9: After a farewell speech to staff, Nixon flies to  
California; while airborne over the Midwest, his letter of 
resignation is delivered to Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and 
becomes effective immediately. Vice President Gerald Ford is 
formally sworn in as president a few minutes after noon and 
declares, ``Our long national nightmare is over.''

<HEADLINE> Soviets Believed Oswald Letter Fake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Officials at the Soviet Embassy in Washington  
had suspicions from the start about a chatty letter they received 
from Lee Harvey Oswald shortly before President Kennedy was 
assassinated. 
</P>
<P>
	In it, Oswald detailed his visit with a top KGB official in  
Mexico City six weeks before being arrested for killing Kennedy in 
Dallas. He pleaded for visas so that he and his wife could return 
to the Soviet Union. He even told them about his new baby daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Privately, embassy officials suspected it was forged, perhaps to  
lay a phony paper trail to make it look like Oswald was working for 
the Soviets, according to long-secret Russian documents released by 
the National Archives on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This letter was clearly a provocation: It gives the impression  
we had close ties with Oswald and were using him for some purposes 
of our own,'' Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin, Moscow's man in 
Washington for 24 years, wrote in an internal memo stamped 
``Highest Priority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dobrynin thought the letter was a fake because it had a  
different tone than previous letters the Soviets had received from 
Oswald, who lived in the communist nation between 1959 and 1962. 
Also, it had been typed, not handwritten like his earlier ones, 
Dobrynin noted. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter was dated Nov. 9, 1963. The embassy received it nine  
days later, but never replied. 
</P>
<P>
	Within a week, Kennedy was dead, and so was Oswald -- shot down  
by Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby. 
</P>
<P>
	``One gets the definite impression that the letter was concocted  
by those who, judging from everything, are involved in the 
president's assassination,'' Dobrynin wrote. ``It is possible that 
Oswald himself wrote the letter as it was dictated to him, in 
return for some promises, and then, as we know, he was simply 
bumped off after his usefulness had ended.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dobrynin memo was contained in more than 80 pages of  
long-secret Soviet documents that Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
gave to President Clinton in June when the two were in Germany. The 
documents offer details about what top-level Soviet officials were 
thinking and talking about when Kennedy was killed Nov. 22, 1963, 
in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were convinced that there had been this massive plot to  
kill Kennedy. What they didn't know was who was a part of the 
conspiracy,'' said Timothy Naftali, director of the presidential 
recordings project at the Miller Center of Public Affairs, a think 
tank and historical research institute at the University of 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	``They thought they had received a false letter. They thought it  
was all part of an orchestrated affair to make it look like the 
Soviet Union was behind the gun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following the assassination, the Soviets gave U.S. officials the  
Oswald letter as well as other information they had gathered during 
his stay in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Oswald arrived there in October 1959 as a tourist and  
immediately asked to remain. 
</P>
<P>
	Because no decision was made on his request before his five-day  
tourist visa expired, Oswald cut his arm in an apparent suicide 
attempt, the documents said. He was hospitalized for a week. 
According to the documents, his attending physician said that if 
Oswald's ``request for permission to remain in the USSR were turned 
down again, he might repeat his suicide attempt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The documents indicate the Soviets denied him citizenship but  
let him stay a year as a foreign national because of his persistent 
requests. He arrived in Minsk in January 1960 -- the same month 
Kennedy announced he was running for president. He worked at a 
radio factory and married a Soviet woman. In 1962, Oswald returned 
with his wife and their baby to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The following year, just days before Kennedy was assassinated,  
the Soviet Embassy in Washington received the letter that Oswald 
allegedly typed in Dallas on Nov. 9, 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Russians get this letter from Oswald that makes him look  
like he's affiliated with them in some way, but he's not affiliated 
with the Russian government,'' said David Lifton, a Los 
Angeles-based researcher who is writing a book on Oswald. ``He's a 
phony Red. Is he a mentally ill person, or is he being 
choreographed by a handler?''

<HEADLINE> Spurs Re-Sign Jaren Jackson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- The San Antonio Spurs re-signed free agent  
guard Jaren Jackson on Friday, retaining their top 3-point shooter 
from last season's playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson got a three-year deal, the amount of which was not  
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, 31, appeared in 47 games last season, averaging 6.4  
points and 2.1 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent the past two seasons with San Antonio after signing  
with the team as a free agent in September 1997. Prior to that, he 
had played for seven different NBA teams 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson had several key moments during the Spurs' playoff run.  
He led the team in 3-pointers made, hitting 31 in 17 playoff games 
and averaging 8.2 points per game in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	His agent, Michael Higgins, did not return a call seeking  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs remain in search of a small forward to take the place  
of Sean Elliott, who needs a kidney translant. San Antonio, which 
has a $2.7 million injury exception to use on the free agent 
market, has been negotiating with Utah free agent swingman Shandon 
Anderson.

<HEADLINE> Medical Bills May Face Y2K Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Patients may want to take some simple  
precautions to protect themselves from billing and recordkeeping 
problems caused by the Year 2000 computer bug, with a government 
report questioning the preparedness of doctors and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's common sense. It's not going to be Armageddon,'' said Dr.  
Richard Corlin, a Santa Monica, Calif., gastroenterologist who is 
the speaker of the American Medical Association's house of 
delegates. ``There's not likely to be a disaster, but there is 
likely to be an inconvenience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Corlin suggested that on their next visit to the doctor or  
pharmacy, people ask about Y2K preparations. The AMA, the nation's 
largest doctors group, estimates that 40 percent of doctor's 
offices store their patient records on computers, but says most 
still keep paper copies too. Billing information and appointment 
schedules also may be computerized. 
</P>
<P>
	The Year 2000 problem -- also called Y2K and the millennium bug --  
occurs because some computer programs, especially older ones, might 
fail when the date changes to 2000. Because the programs were 
written to recognize only the last two digits of a year, such 
programs could read the digits ``00'' as 1900 instead of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Just to be safe, Corlin recommended that those who know they  
will need prescription refills during the first weeks of 2000 
should get them in December. And people who have medical 
appointments scheduled early next year should call to confirm them 
after Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers are also advised to make sure their insurance cards  
are current and to keep copies of recent claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Failures in health care providers' billing systems have been  
discovered in Y2K testing conducted by Medicare -- the nation's 
health care program for the elderly and disabled -- according to a 
report from the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Testing with providers has been limited and reported results  
are not encouraging,'' the GAO told the House Commerce Committee in 
the July 28 report. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said more than a quarter of health care providers --  
123 out of 434 -- who participated in Medicare claims tests 
conducted before June 21 ran into problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The report did not assess whether hospitals, doctors' offices  
and others are doing enough to ensure that medical devices such as 
X-ray machines or heart-monitors that use computer chips will work 
properly starting Jan. 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	But the GAO was generally critical of surveys that industry  
groups, such as the AMA and the American Hospital Association, have 
used to offer public reassurance that the nation's health care 
system will be Y2K ready. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of the 11 surveys we reviewed provided sufficient  
information with which to assess the Year 2000 status of the health 
care community,'' said the GAO report. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion  
cited health care among areas of concern in its third quarterly 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	``The existing information of the readiness of some health care  
providers indicates that much work remains to be done,'' said the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
	Health care industry leaders insist they will be ready for Jan.  
1, when it is feared that many computers, originally programed to 
recognize only the last two digits of the year, will not be able to 
differentiate between 2000 and 1900. Unless reprogrammed in time, 
computers could malfunction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hospitals will be prepared and will have the ability to submit  
their bills,'' said Fred Brown, chairman of the AHA's board. 
``Hospitals are not run by machines. They're really run by 
caregivers, by nurses, by physicians. ... There's human backup to 
the machines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO study said recent assurances about Y2K readiness from  
industry groups, including the AHA, have been based on surveys that 
may be unreliable because of low response rates. For example, just 
7 percent of doctors responded to a survey that the AMA has touted, 
saying that 94 percent of physicians expect to be Y2K-ready before 
the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, such surveys generally have required no independent  
verification of providers' claims of Y2K readiness. The GAO cited 
similar shortcomings in surveys by 9 other groups, including the 
American Clinical Laboratory Association and the American Ambulance 
Association.

<HEADLINE> Panel To Rule on Holocaust Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The head of an international Holocaust-era  
insurance claims commission was working out final details Friday on 
a proposal for determining the value of German policies held by 
Jewish victims of the Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Eagleburger, former secretary of state who chairs the  
commission, was preparing a memorandum for commission members 
before making his decision public, a brief statement from his 
office said. The commission comprises representatives of insurance 
companies and Jewish organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Eagleburger's decision could clear the way for payment of $90  
million or more in insurance claims by descendants of Jews killed 
during the Holocaust who held policies in Germany. A formula for 
payment on policies issued in East European countries was agreed 
upon earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The five European insurers involved requested in varying degrees  
modifications in Eagleburger's preliminary findings. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a participant, Eagleburger decided to place a  
``real value'' of about 10 times the prewar face value on policies 
issued by the companies. Eagleburger used a complex formula linked 
in part to long-term German bonds. A five-day period for 
registering objections to his formula ended Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Insurance companies involved have set up a $100 million fund for  
the German claims, which includes $10 million for expenses involved 
in tracking down and paying the claims. Payments already have been 
made in some cases, but claimants contested the amounts. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission's work covers claims against five major European  
companies. The bulk were held by Assicurazioni Generali of Italy 
and Allilanz of Germany. The other three companies are AXA of 
France and Winterthur and Zurich of Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	The next step is a meeting of the commission in London at the  
end of the month to adopt a process for compiling lists of 
policyholders and notifying families of Nazi victims. The aim is to 
begin payments at the end of October.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Drop / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar continued its decline against the yen  
today on selling by Japanese life insurance companies. Tokyo stocks 
closed sharply lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 114.28 yen at late-afternoon, down 0.34 yen  
from its level of 114.62 yen late Thursday in Tokyo and below its 
late New York level of 114.30 yen overnight. It ranged during the 
day from 114.24 yen to 114.80 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 273.95 points,  
or 1.58 percent, to close the week at 17,084.24. On Thursday, the 
average slid 327.19 points, or 1.85 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealing, traders said market players are still  
concerned that the strong yen will hurt Japan's fledging economic 
recovery and force export-oriented Japanese companies to revise 
down their earnings forecasts for the current fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese officials have recently indicated that they would  
prefer that the dollar trade at around 120 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	A stronger yen hurts Japan's exporters as it makes their  
products more expensive abroad and reduces the value of their 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's quite a bit of anxiety in Japan,'' said Robert Sasaki,  
head of the quantitative strategy group at Jardine Fleming 
Securities. ``It's pretty tough for Japanese exporters to make 
money, and Japan is an exporting country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In stock trading, Tokyo share prices closed lower today for a  
third straight day as Japanese and overseas investors dumped stocks 
amid persistent worries about the yen's strength. 
</P>
<P>
	That concern left many investors bearish in Tokyo despite an  
overnight rise on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial 
average advanced 119.05 points, or 1.1 percent, to 10,793.82 at 
Thursday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 10.34 points, or 0.72 percent, to 1,420.68. 
The TOPIX closed down 28.65 points, or 1.96 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was  
estimated at 463.35 million shares, down from 494.23 million shares 
Thursday. Retreats outnumbered advances 825 to 357, while 128 
issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 122.90 yen, down  
from 123.40 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.8100 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.8250 
percent, driving its price up to 99.91 yen from 99.78 yen.

<HEADLINE> Andretti Just Loves To Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- No one can accuse Michael Andretti of riding on  
his father Mario's name. The younger Andretti has carved out his 
own niche in racing. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason is simple enough: Michael Andretti just loves to  
drive. 
</P>
<P>
	Andretti, thanks to a fourth-place finish in the U.S. 500 at  
Michigan Speedway on July 25, stands third in the CART FedEx Series 
with 107 points. He trails rookie Juan Montoya, who has four wins 
and 129 points, and Dario Franchitti, who has 116 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Andretti's definitely someone to watch in this weekend's Tenneco  
Automotive Grand Prix of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``These next three weeks are probably the most important of the  
season,'' Andretti said Thursday. ``Whoever is in front after we 
leave here is in good shape for a run at the championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andretti got off to a slow start this season. For one thing, the  
Newman-Haas racing team switched from Goodyear tires to Firestone 
three weeks before the season opener. Tires might not seem like a 
big item to weekend drivers, but half a second can be the 
difference between winning and losing on this circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're learning all the time,'' Andretti said. ``We've got a  
better feel for things now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the 14th time in his 16 years in the series, Andretti  
has topped 100 points. But that's not why he could be a force on 
the temporary road course around Belle Isle. 
</P>
<P>
	Andretti has won more races (38), more poles (32) and led more  
laps (6,057) than any other active driver. He has earned 25 of his 
wins on street courses like this one. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps most important of all, Andretti has won this race twice,  
in 1990 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am really looking forward to this race,'' Andretti said.  
``It is always an important race for us because it is Kmart and 
Ford's hometown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They just happen to be two of Andretti's biggest sponsors.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite Andretti's high hopes, Montoya is the likely favorite in  
this race. Montoya, the only driver with more than one victory this 
season, has won on the short oval at Nazareth, finished second in 
the U.S. 500 at Michigan and won on street courses at Long Beach 
and Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, it doesn't seem to matter what kind of course he runs  
on. Andretti isn't fussy, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what's so great about this circuit,'' Andretti said.  
``You can go from Michigan Speedway, where you go 130 miles an hour 
in turns, to here, where you might not do 30 in a turn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His two wins in Detroit were about as different as they could  
be. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 1990 race was like a dream race, because we almost lapped  
second place,'' Andretti said. ``That was very different from 1996, 
when I really shouldn't have won the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That year, he was running second behind Christian Fittipaldi.  
When Fittipaldi went wide on the last restart, Andretti got by him. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the Detroit course is so tight, passing is difficult. As  
a result, qualifying could be vital. Montoya, for example, has 
started on the pole four times this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Practice and qualifying Friday and Saturday are very important  
days,'' Andretti said. ``If you want to win here, you almost have 
to start near the front row.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The drivers were scheduled to practice today, then qualify on  
Saturday. The race is set for 3 p.m. EDT Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite changes to the course to try to make it easier for the  
competitors to pass, most of the 72-lap event on the 2.346-mile, 
14-turn circuit looked more like a parade than a race last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Alex Zanardi, who led 50 of the 72 laps, won the 1998 Detroit  
race. But he won't be around to defend his title. Zanardi is racing 
the Formula One circuit this year.

<HEADLINE> More GED Earners Planning College </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Christopher North dropped out of high  
school in 1983, his choice had seemed obvious: He had to bring home 
a paycheck to help his parents. 
</P>
<P>
	But today, North, a 32-year-old single father in Escondido,  
Calif., says his choice is to get a high school education and go on 
to college. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know a better education means better money and a better  
future, but I also wanted to be a good role model for my 
daughter,'' he said of 9-year-old Alyse. ``I couldn't expect it of 
her if I didn't do it myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	North, who earned his high school equivalency diploma last year,  
is one of a record number of GED test-takers planning to go to 
college. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Council on Education, which runs the General  
Educational Development Tests, said in a report Friday that 67.7 
percent of the people who took the battery of five tests in 1998 
planned to use their GED diploma for further study. That figure 
tops the previous year's 65.4 percent reporting college plans and 
is nearly double the 35.6 percent of GED test-takers 20 years ago 
who planned college. 
</P>
<P>
	``The GED is really not an endpoint; it's only the beginning,''  
said Susan Porter Robinson, vice president of the Center for Adult 
Learning, which directs the tests and other learning programs. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, slightly more adults passed the tests, with 506,000  
people earning high school credentials in 1998, up from 481,000 in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Created for soldiers returning from World War II, the  
56-year-old equivalency credential accounts for one in seven high 
school diplomas awarded in the United States. The average age of a 
test-taker is 24 in the United States and 30 in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 90 percent of U.S. colleges and universities now  
accept students who earn the credential. The number of people 
taking the GED to get better jobs has dropped from about 40 percent 
in the 1970s to 28 percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could have blamed leaving school on a million things. ...  
Looking back, I really should have stayed,'' said North, now a 
freshman education major at California State University, San 
Marcos. But a summer job at a toy warehouse grew into a full-time 
job: ``Little did I know that those kind of jobs don't give you the 
stability you need to take care of a family and have a future. Try 
telling a teen-ager that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were fewer adults in the United States and Canada who took  
the GED tests, 718,464 in 1998, compared with 722,461 in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Test-taking dropped off after Jan. 1, 1997, when test-givers  
raised minimum scores on each test section so that high scores in 
one section could not be used to compensate for low scores in 
another. But that year, the passing rates also dipped by about 3 
percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, New Mexico had the largest U.S. increase in the number  
of test-takers: 17 percent. Test-taking in Canada was led by the 
Northwest Territories, which had a 23.7 percent increase from 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Other increases in test volume for 1998 were in Texas, 13.2  
percent; Wisconsin, 12.9 percent; Wyoming, 13.1 percent; and 
Minnesota, 11.3 percent. Decreases were in Vermont, 26.4 percent; 
the District of Columbia, 23.3 percent; Mississippi, 18.4 percent; 
Florida, 18.1 percent; and New Jersey, 12.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of adults taking special editions of the test --  
Braille and audiocassette versions, for example -- more than doubled 
from 1,169 in 1989 to 2,503 in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Winners in Unwed Births Contest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With one in three of the nation's babies born  
to unwed parents, Congress is giving states a challenge: Reduce the 
out-of-wedlock birth rate the most, and share in $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, four states and the District of Columbia have been notified  
by the Department of Health and Human Services that they are the 
first year's winners, provided they can prove that abortions also 
declined. 
</P>
<P>
	The winners were diverse -- California, Michigan, Alabama,  
Massachusetts and the district -- and officials were puzzled to 
explain their success. Massachusetts began with one of the lowest 
unwed birth rates; D.C. had the highest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why these five states? I don't think there's much we have to  
say on that,'' Michael Kharfen, a spokesman for the Department of 
Health and Human Services, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The winners had their own guesses.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's been a message about welfare changing and changing  
fairly radically,'' said Joel Sanders, who directs Alabama's 
welfare reform program. He also credited the strong economy. 
</P>
<P>
	But he acknowledged that virtually every state has tough welfare  
rules and a strong economy. ``That's where the luck comes into 
it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Massachusetts and California, officials credited programs  
that give communities money to create pregnancy prevention 
programs, generally focused on teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
	California also credits increased access to birth control and  
evolving attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a combination of programs and changing social mores among  
families in California, where out-of-wedlock pregnancy is no longer 
as easily accepted,'' said Anna Ramierz, who runs California's 
Office of Family Planning. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, about one in three babies is born to a single  
mother. The figures range from 16 percent in Utah to 65 percent in 
the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The winners have until Sept. 1 to prove that abortions did not  
increase between 1995 and 1997. Those that do will share the $100 
million. An additional $100 million will be awarded in each of the 
next several years, based on subsequent data. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress included the bonus money in the 1996 welfare bill,  
though it was hardly noticed at the time. It was included to 
appease lawmakers who wanted to limit welfare payments when a 
mother has additional children while on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, states got a lucrative incentive to reduce their  
out-of-wedlock birth rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The contest includes all births outside marriage to teens and  
adults, to families on and off welfare. 
</P>
<P>
	While many states have targeted teen-agers, teen-age moms  
account for only one in three unwed births. 
</P>
<P>
	And though states credit the welfare overhaul, the first bonuses  
were based on statistics from 1996 and 1997, when the changes were 
just beginning. The welfare law creating the bonuses wasn't signed 
until August 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``It definitely can't just be from the welfare reform because of  
the timing. It has to be other things,'' said Stephanie Venture, 
who tracks birth trends for the National Center for Health 
Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	The unwed birth rate peaked in 1994 at 32.6 percent and has been  
relatively stable since then, after climbing dramatically through 
the late 1980s and early 1990s. In 1985, it was just 22 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The national rate was unchanged between 1994-95 and 1996-97.  
</P>
<P>
	But 12 states reduced their rates, led by California, which  
dropped by 5.7 percent. In the rest of the country, rates went up, 
sometimes substantially. In North Dakota, the increase was 10 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	To reduce the out-of-wedlock rate, the number of illegitimate  
births must fall more quickly than births to married women. That's 
tricky, given that all births -- including marital births -- are 
dropping across the country, Ventura said. 
</P>
<P>
	The District of Columbia may have benefited from demographics.  
Births to unmarried black women have been dropping across the 
country, and the district's population is overwhelmingly black. 
</P>
<P>
	But no one is really sure what's going on -- other than intense  
interest among the states in getting the money. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question that the large financial bonus has  
created interest in the states and a lot of programs and policies 
large and small have been implemented,'' said Kristin Moore, who 
studies these issues at Child Trends. ``But it probably was not in 
time to have caused these declines.''

<HEADLINE> Cuba Contesting Sotomayor Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Cuban sports officials, claiming that their  
athletes face continuing prejudice, will contest a ruling that cost 
high jumper Javier Sotomayor a gold medal at the Pan American Games 
because of a positive drug test. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our athletes have had to compete under an atmosphere of  
hostility, exaggerated provocation and unlimited intolerance,'' 
sports minister Humberto Rodriguez said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez said Cuba will fight Sotomayor's two-year suspension  
from international competition that will force him out of this 
month's world championships and next year's Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	He couldn't say on what grounds the Cubans might appeal or offer  
any explanation for the presence of cocaine in two urine samples 
taken from the world record-holder and four-time Pan Ams gold 
medalist. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is something I do not have to explain,'' he said while  
offering a lecture on the value of sport to Cuba and the honor and 
unimpeachable integrity of Cuban athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been subject to such pressure in training centers ...  
phone calls, personal messages in direct and indirect 
provocations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban officials have charged that Sotomayor was framed, and that  
the cocaine must have been slipped into his food or drink before 
the competition as part of a plot by Cuba's enemies. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Ramon Fernandez, a vice president of the Cuban Council of  
Ministers, made veiled references to the United States during a 
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``They denied before the plots to assassinate, to sabotage,''  
Fernandez said. ``What is the hairy, ugly, powerful hand behind 
this? We do not know yet. ... With technology and power, certain 
agencies can do anything, even things we can't think of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor, meanwhile, angrily disputed the positive cocaine test  
that cost him his gold medal and said he was the unwitting victim 
of a ``dirty trick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I am innocent,'' the world record-holder told reporters as he  
left his home Thursday in the fashionable Miramar neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview published and broadcast by Cuba's state media,  
Sotomayor said he doesn't even take vitamins. He pointed out that 
countless previous drug tests at competitions and by Cuba's 
official sports doctors had all showed negative results. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have only seen that substance in the movies,'' Sotomayor  
said about cocaine in an interview with the Communist Party daily 
Granma. ``I am the victim of a maneuver, a dirty trick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sotomayor case is the biggest drug scandal in track and  
field since Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson was suspended and 
stripped of his gold medal after testing positive for an anabolic 
steroid at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Sotomayor has talked only to Cuba's  
government-controlled media, which has supported him. 
</P>
<P>
	But to Pan Am medical officials, all that matters is that the  
drug was in Sotomayor's urine. They said they don't question how it 
got there. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor, the world indoor and outdoor record-holder and the  
only high jumper to clear 8 feet, won his fourth Pan Am gold in the 
high jump on Friday. Following the drug test results, he was 
stripped of the medal and suspended for two years. That makes him 
ineligible for this month's World Track and Field Championships and 
next year's Olympics in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor was the third athlete -- all gold medalists -- to test  
positive at the games. Canada's in-line roller hockey team lost its 
gold medal after goalie Steve Vezina's positive test. The Dominican 
Republic's Juana Rosario Arrendel, the women's high-jump winner, 
lost her prize as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor's urine sample showed a reading consistent with a  
person who uses cocaine, Pan Am medical chief Eduardo de Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
	Recreational drug use remains rare in Cuba, and is frowned upon  
by Fidel Castro's government, which considers it a negative 
byproduct of capitalism. But drug use has grown in recent years 
with an increase of tourism to the island nation.

<HEADLINE> Giants' Brown Has Surgery on Butt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- New York Giants starting halfback Gary Brown  
underwent a minor surgical procedure Friday to drain blood from a 
hematoma on his buttocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Russell Warren removed a few cubic centimeters of blood from  
the hematoma on the left side of Brown's buttocks during the 
procedure at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City, 
coach Jim Fassel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Warren left a small puncture in the wound to allow it to  
continue to drain overnight, Fassel said, adding he expected Brown 
to remain hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not known when Brown will be able to play.  
</P>
<P>
	Brown, the Giants' leading rusher last year, developed the  
hematoma after a motorcycle accident last month.

<HEADLINE> Murder Charges in Ala. Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIANA, Ala. (AP) -- A man accused of shooting three people  
to death at two companies where he had worked told one of his 
victims, ``I'm tired of your rumors about me,'' a prosecutor said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	At a court hearing today, District Attorney Robert Owens Jr.  
said Alan Eugene Miller made the comment when he shot Terry Jarvis 
to death at Post Airgas Co. on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor gave a brief description of the killings as a  
judge ordered Miller held without bond. Miller, clad in an orange 
jumpsuit with his arms and legs shackled, sat and nodded at times, 
giving only brief ``yes'' and ``yes, sir'' responses to the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, 34, is charged in the shooting deaths of two of his  
co-workers at Ferguson Enterprises and then later killing of 
Jarvis, 39, at Post Airgas, a company where he previously worked. 
</P>
<P>
	The district attorney said Miller entered the unlocked Ferguson  
building with a gun Thursday morning and first met Lee Holdbrooks. 
``As a result of whatever was said, shots were fired,'' Owens said, 
with Holdbrooks, 32, killed by numerous shots to the chest and one 
to the head. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Miller then went down a hall and shot Christopher Yancy,  
28, to death, then ran out of the building as another employee 
entered, saw the gun and said, ``Don't shoot me. I haven't done 
anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The account of the shooting of Jarvis at Port Airgas came from a  
witness who heard the comment, Owens said. Miller also briefly 
pointed the gun at the witness, who ran away, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting spree in the bustling Birmingham suburb of Pelham  
took place one week and about 145 miles down the road from an 
Atlanta office massacre that left nine dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Police charged the Miller with three counts of capital murder.  
He was arrested after officers spotted him driving on nearby 
Interstate 65 and forced him to pull over. The heavyset Miller 
scuffled with officers briefly and a handgun was found in his small 
truck, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney appointed to represent Miller, Mickey Johnson, said  
earlier that he had not discussed the crime in any detail with his 
client. He described Miller as ``confused'' when he spoke with him 
at the police department Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller had agreed to give a blood sample to investigators,  
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The unmarried Miller lived with his mother, Barbara Miller, in  
Billingsley. She said her son ``went off to work just as he always 
does this morning. He left here like he always does, with a 7-Up 
and a couple of things of biscuits and sausage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Alan didn't bother anybody,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	She said he was laid off earlier this year by Post Airgas,  
describing the cause as ``economic downsizing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sherrie Williams, a neighbor of the Millers, was surprised at  
his arrest and said the suspect had always been ``real nice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We leave for work about the same time. He always speaks,'' she  
said. ``He doesn't strike you as a fellow who would do something 
like they say he has done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pelham is a city of about 10,000 that is part of sprawling  
suburbs in wooded hills south of Birmingham. The area is a mix of 
upscale subdivisions, commercial districts and rural farmland. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody around here is just regular working people,'' said  
Cathy McKay, owner of a carpet store across the street from Post 
Airgas. ``You feel safe coming out here at night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting, she said, ``is just beyond my comprehension.''  
</P>
<P>
	The shootings came a week after day trader Mark Barton fatally  
shot nine people and injured 13 others at two brokerage firms in 
Atlanta in one of the worst office massacres in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Herder, a day trader who worked with Barton, was released  
from the hospital Wednesday and found the Pelham shootings a 
troubling echo of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``To a degree it's really frightening that all of a sudden that  
someone is copying this,'' he said. ``I can't believe some idiot 
has started to copy it.''

<HEADLINE> Actor Said To Owe Child Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Actor Stan Shaw has been indicted on a felony  
charge of willful failure to pay child support. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials say Shaw, who played heavyweight boxer Lincoln Tyler  
in last year's movie ``Snake Eyes,'' owes more than $60,000 in back 
support for a child living in Clark County. Wednesday's indictment 
does not list the child's name or age. 
</P>
<P>
	``The federal criminal prosecution is kind of a last resort,''  
Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw, 47, is obligated to pay $500 a month to support his child,  
according to Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
	The actor, who is represented by the Metropolitan Talent Agency  
in Los Angeles, could not be reached for comment. A man who 
identified himself only as an assistant to Shaw's agent, Karen 
Forman, said no one would comment on the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	The actor has appeared on stage, television and in motion  
pictures for at least 25 years, including in the films 
``Daylight,'' and ``Fried Green Tomatoes.''

<HEADLINE>  Driver Waltrip To Retire in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- If it wasn't for videotape, Darrell  
Waltrip's two daughters might find it hard to believe he's won a 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	``ESPN has done a real good job giving me some credibility with  
my family,'' said Waltrip, who announced Thursday that he's 
retiring after next season. ``That's about all I've got right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip, always one of racing's great characters, insists he  
still can be a great driver at age 52. Before he walks away from 
the fumes, throaty exhaust and competition for good, he thinks he 
can find his way to victory lane again. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been a long time. Waltrip hasn't won a race since 1992, the  
year his second daughter was born. 
</P>
<P>
	``She'd really like to see her daddy win a race,'' Waltrip said.  
``There are some fun things you get to do when you win a race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Who could forget Waltrip, the good ol' boy from Kentucky, doing  
the ``Icky Shuffle'' in victory lane in 1989 and wailing like a 
child, ``I won the Daytona 500! I won the Daytona 500!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Waltrip hasn't had nearly enough fun.  
</P>
<P>
	He's won three Winston Cup championships and leads active  
drivers with 84 career victories, tied for third with Bobby 
Allison. But Waltrip has been running on fumes of late; he hasn't 
won a race since Darlington in September 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip, who ran out of former champion's provisionals two weeks  
ago at Pocono, unveiled a new car he'll use for the rest of the 
season -- and next year, in what he's calling ``Victory Tour 2000.'' 
He made the bold prediction that he'll qualify consistently in the 
top 25 from now on. 
</P>
<P>
	``There should be no excuse for me and this car to miss races,''  
Waltrip said. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, the Victory Tour got off to an ignominious start Thursday  
when Waltrip stalled just before attempting his qualifying run for 
the Brickyard 400. With less than a minute before time would run 
out on the session, Waltrip fired up the car and was 32nd-fastest 
on the first day of qualifying at 176.478 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	With a sheepish grin, Waltrip explained the mishap.  
</P>
<P>
	``The battery cable was off the battery,'' Waltrip said. ``It's  
a good thing it came off when it did. If it came off during my run, 
I'd be in trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip, who rarely misses a punchline, nailed the one  
pertaining to the name of his victory tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be kind of a fake tour, kind of a farce if we call it  
a victory tour and we don't produce a victory,'' Waltrip said. 
``Winning a race now would be just as special as winning that first 
one in 1975.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Admitting that the end was near left Waltrip momentarily  
speechless -- probably for the first time in his career. He came in 
with a such a bang that it would seem only fitting if he had one 
more trick to pull off. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came into this sport in 1972, and I've been a headliner ever  
since,'' Waltrip said. ``When I'd go to town, people would say, 
`Are you here with the show?' And I'd say, `No, I am the show.''' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a glimpse of the arrogance that earned Waltrip the  
nickname ``Jaws'' in the early days, when he was viewed as stock 
car racing's outlaw. It's been quite a turnabout, because he will 
go out as the beloved ``old DW.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip, a native of Owensboro, Ky., who lives in Franklin,  
Tenn., is finishing a two-year contract with the No. 66 KMart Ford 
Taurus, owned by Travis Carter and Carl Haas. He finished 25th in 
the most recent race at Pocono Raceway and placing 38th in the 
season points.

	``I guess in every sport your legs give our, your arm gives out,  
something gives out,'' Waltrip said. ``I think every athlete that's 
been successful like I have, one thing never gives out. Your heart 
never gives out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His younger brother, also a Winston Cup competitor, can attest  
to that.

	``When the book is written about NASCAR racing, he will  
certainly have a chapter in it,'' Michael Waltrip said. ``One of 
the things that I most admire about him is that he's been able to 
do it on his own terms, and that hasn't always made everybody 
happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, every time Waltrip came up with what seemed like  
the one-liner that defined his career, he topped himself. This may 
have said it all. 
</P>
<P>
	``It became painfully obvious to me -- and it hasn't changed all  
that much -- that the squeaky wheel gets the grease,'' Waltrip said. 
``And so I turned up the squealing as hard as I could.''

<HEADLINE>  Driver Waltrip To Retire in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- If it wasn't for videotape, Darrell  
Waltrip's two daughters might find it hard to believe he's won a 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	``ESPN has done a real good job giving me some credibility with  
my family,'' said Waltrip, who announced Thursday that he's 
retiring after next season. ``That's about all I've got right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip, always one of racing's great characters, insists he  
still can be a great driver at age 52. Before he walks away from 
the fumes, throaty exhaust and competition for good, he thinks he 
can find his way to victory lane again. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been a long time. Waltrip hasn't won a race since 1992, the  
year his second daughter was born. 
</P>
<P>
	``She'd really like to see her daddy win a race,'' Waltrip said.  
``There are some fun things you get to do when you win a race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Who could forget Waltrip, the good ol' boy from Kentucky, doing  
the ``Icky Shuffle'' in victory lane in 1989 and wailing like a 
child, ``I won the Daytona 500! I won the Daytona 500!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Waltrip hasn't had nearly enough fun.  
</P>
<P>
	He's won three Winston Cup championships and leads active  
drivers with 84 career victories, tied for third with Bobby 
Allison. But Waltrip has been running on fumes of late; he hasn't 
won a race since Darlington in September 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip, who ran out of former champion's provisionals two weeks  
ago at Pocono, unveiled a new car he'll use for the rest of the 
season -- and next year, in what he's calling ``Victory Tour 2000.'' 
He made the bold prediction that he'll qualify consistently in the 
top 25 from now on. 
</P>
<P>
	``There should be no excuse for me and this car to miss races,''  
Waltrip said. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, the Victory Tour got off to an ignominious start Thursday  
when Waltrip stalled just before attempting his qualifying run for 
the Brickyard 400. With less than a minute before time would run 
out on the session, Waltrip fired up the car and was 32nd-fastest 
on the first day of qualifying at 176.478 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	With a sheepish grin, Waltrip explained the mishap.  
</P>
<P>
	``The battery cable was off the battery,'' Waltrip said. ``It's  
a good thing it came off when it did. If it came off during my run, 
I'd be in trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip, who rarely misses a punchline, nailed the one  
pertaining to the name of his victory tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be kind of a fake tour, kind of a farce if we call it  
a victory tour and we don't produce a victory,'' Waltrip said. 
``Winning a race now would be just as special as winning that first 
one in 1975.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Admitting that the end was near left Waltrip momentarily  
speechless -- probably for the first time in his career. He came in 
with a such a bang that it would seem only fitting if he had one 
more trick to pull off. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came into this sport in 1972, and I've been a headliner ever  
since,'' Waltrip said. ``When I'd go to town, people would say, 
`Are you here with the show?' And I'd say, `No, I am the show.''' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a glimpse of the arrogance that earned Waltrip the  
nickname ``Jaws'' in the early days, when he was viewed as stock 
car racing's outlaw. It's been quite a turnabout, because he will 
go out as the beloved ``old DW.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip, a native of Owensboro, Ky., who lives in Franklin,  
Tenn., is finishing a two-year contract with the No. 66 KMart Ford 
Taurus, owned by Travis Carter and Carl Haas. He finished 25th in 
the most recent race at Pocono Raceway and placing 38th in the 
season points. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess in every sport your legs give our, your arm gives out,  
something gives out,'' Waltrip said. ``I think every athlete that's 
been successful like I have, one thing never gives out. Your heart 
never gives out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His younger brother, also a Winston Cup competitor, can attest  
to that. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the book is written about NASCAR racing, he will  
certainly have a chapter in it,'' Michael Waltrip said. ``One of 
the things that I most admire about him is that he's been able to 
do it on his own terms, and that hasn't always made everybody 
happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, every time Waltrip came up with what seemed like  
the one-liner that defined his career, he topped himself. This may 
have said it all. 
</P>
<P>
	``It became painfully obvious to me -- and it hasn't changed all  
that much -- that the squeaky wheel gets the grease,'' Waltrip said. 
``And so I turned up the squealing as hard as I could.''

<HEADLINE> McGwire: Aaron Record Too Far Away </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Suddenly, 755 homers doesn't seem like such a  
monument in the distance for Mark McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	Having punched his automatic ticket to the Hall of Fame with his  
500th and 501st homers in a 10-3 loss to the San Diego Padres 
Thursday night, McGwire's next big goal is Hank Aaron's career 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too far away,'' McGwire said. ``The logical answer if  
anybody wants to talk about somebody who's going to break the 
record would be Ken Griffey Jr.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's McGwire that the record-holder, who watched McGwire on the  
video scoreboard at Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh, is worried 
about. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way he's hitting home runs, he could break the record next  
year,'' Aaron said. ``He's hitting them in bunches. Seventy home 
runs? He might hit 80 some year. Whew! That's a lot of home runs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Time is against McGwire. Though he's the fastest man to 500 in  
history by 314 at-bats -- more than half a season's worth -- he'll be 
36 in the offseason. Heel injuries robbed him of two prime years, 
when he totaled 18 homers in 1993 and '94. 
</P>
<P>
	The key now is his back, which occasionally flares up.  
</P>
<P>
	``It all comes down to health,'' McGwire said. ``I think the  
biggest concern for me as far as longevity is my back. If my back 
holds up, I can play for a few more years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the back hasn't bothered him too much, considering he has  
hit 224 homers the last 3 1-2 seasons, and could get another 20 or 
so this year. Four more years of 50 a season after that, which 
right now is a modest total for McGwire, and Aaron is in range. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire has been particularly devastating whenever he nears a  
milestone or gets into a duel like his battle with Sammy Sosa last 
year, when each player brought out the best in their opponent. 
McGwire smelled the goal line last season when he homered five 
times in the last three games to bury Sosa and finish with a record 
70 to Sosa's 66. 
</P>
<P>
	``He maintained intense concentration for six months, which is  
almost impossible to do, unless you're Superman,'' manager Tony La 
Russa said. ``I think sometimes he's Superman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire wanted to hit No. 500 in St. Louis, where he also hit  
Nos. 61, 62 and 70 last year, so he hit seven in the just-completed 
seven-game homestand. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mind is very, very strong,'' McGwire said. ``When I get in  
that box, I'm totally focused. I know what I need to do to get 
ready each game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres were in awe.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's like he's allergic to a base-hit, too,'' manager Bruce  
Bochy said. ``I mean, the ball's leaving the park every time he 
hits it. I don't know where he's going to finish, but I mean, pure 
power, he's got to be the greatest power hitter of all time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now he belongs to a very exclusive club. Every eligible  
500-homer man is in the Hall, and Eddie Murray, the last man to 
reach the milestone in 1996, will be there soon. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a club he someday could rule. There are several targets  
looming just ahead: Murray (504), Mel Ott (511), Ernie Banks and 
Eddie Matthews (512), Ted Williams and Willie McCovey (521). 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm well-aware of the names,'' McGwire said. ``It's rather odd  
to have your name with that group, because I feel I have a few more 
years to play. I'm not done playing.''

<HEADLINE> Kurdish Rebels To Honor Cease-Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Kurdish rebels said Friday they would  
honor an upcoming cease-fire agreement, unless Turkish military 
forces attacked them during their promised retreat from southeast 
Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels' imprisoned and condemned leader, Abdullah Ocalan --  
known by the nickname Apo -- has ordered his guerrillas to stop 
fighting and withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
	``We regard the call by President Apo to stop the war by Sept. 1  
as an order, and express that we will impose it in unity,'' the 
Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	But the group stressed that the guerrillas would defend  
themselves if attacked. 
</P>
<P>
	``No armed action will be carried out by our forces other than  
using our right to self-defense against possible attacks,'' the 
statement pledged, saying that Turkish forces might misinterpret 
this retreat as a sign of weakness. 
</P>
<P>
	Kurdish guerrillas have been fighting for autonomy since 1984.  
The conflict has killed 37,000 people, mostly Kurds. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the cease-fire pledge, due to take effect at the end of  
August, rebels ambushed a military patrol in the southeastern 
province of Van on Thursday evening, killing a reserve officer and 
wounding a private, the Anatolia news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Ocalan said that ``unless it is necessary, engaging  
in clashes should be avoided.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to some Turkish suggestions that the withdrawal was  
not satisfactory and that the rebels should surrender, Ocalan said 
such expectations were ``unrealistic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan said the withdrawal would allow the region's problems to  
be examined. Turkey would be able to start reforms, and the rebel 
group could make its transformation to a democratic institution, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, rebel leaders wanted greater democracy in Turkey,  
with minority rights guaranteed and bans on Kurdish-language 
broadcasting and education lifted. 
</P>
<P>
	Premier Bulent Ecevit repeated Friday that Turkey would not  
negotiate with the rebels, who Turkey considers to be 
``terrorists,'' private NTV television said. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey's past refusals to negotiate with the rebels have led to  
the failure of previous cease-fires. Other times, the cease-fires 
were broken by rebel attacks, such as the 1993 case in which rebels 
killed 33 unarmed soldiers a few weeks after they declared a 
cease-fire.

<HEADLINE> IBM Confirms Tax Probe of Brit Biz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- IBM has confirmed that British tax authorities are  
investigating its accounts, but it would not comment Friday on a 
report that it has been accused of illegally trying to lower its 
tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal reported that the inquiry stems from  
charges by a former International Business Machines Corp. employee 
that the company paid artificially high royalties to its U.S. 
parent to reduce its British income. The paper attributed the 
information to people familiar with the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Board of Inland Revenue, Britain's tax collection agency,  
refused to comment, citing reasons of confidentiality. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM said in a statement it ``is currently working with the  
Inland Revenue on an inquiry. This is a normal and routine 
procedure, and IBM is cooperating fully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The world's largest computer company added that it had no  
comment on the charges or the former employee who reportedly made 
them, Gerard M. Churchhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal said Churchhouse, a former sales and marketing  
manager for IBM UK Ltd., alleged that the company avoided paying 
nearly $500 million in British taxes between 1991 and 1996 by 
raising to 12 percent from 8 percent the royalties it paid its 
parent for revenues earned in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper said that if the allegation is true, it would mean IBM  
lowered the operating profit of its British unit, and in turn its 
British taxes. It would also mean a corresponding increase in 
operating profit for IBM's business in the United States, where IBM 
did not pay taxes between 1991 and 1993 because it lost money. U.S. 
operations became profitable again in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Inland Revenue has been investigating IBM's financial records  
for about two years, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal said IBM fired Churchhouse in 1995 and that his  
allegations were part of a lawsuit he later filed against the 
company in New York's Supreme Court. The lawsuit, dismissed earlier 
this year, did not specifically address the merits of his tax 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal said Churchhouse alleged IBM parent ordered its  
British unit to boost its royalty payments in 1991. The 
four-percentage-point increase in 1991 amounted to 160 million 
pounds in extra royalties that year, or about $260 million at 
current exchange rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Churchhouse estimated the total amount of royalty increases from  
1991 to 1996 was as much as 900 million pounds, or $1.45 billion, 
and that IBM avoided paying roughly 300 million pounds, or $480 
million, over that period.

<HEADLINE> A Look at Drought Conditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Some drought facts:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The period of April through July was the driest in 105 years  
of recordkeeping for Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey and Rhode 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
	-- It was the second driest April-July on record for Connecticut,  
Massachusetts, New York and West Virginia. Among nearby states, it 
was the third driest on record for Maine, fifth driest in New 
Hampshire and sixth in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	-- April-July was the hottest on record for Rhode Island and  
among the 10 hottest such periods for New York, New Jersey and the 
rest of New England. 
</P>
<P>
	-- One-year rainfall totals were 10 to 18 inches below normal  
over much of eastern and southern Pennsylvania, New Jersey, central 
and western Maryland and parts of Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	-- During July, rainfall totals were below one inch in parts of  
central Maryland, eastern Pennsylvania, northern New Jersey, and 
the New York City area, making it the driest July on record for 
locations including Allentown and New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	-- 83 percent of New England streams had flows in the lowest 25  
percent on record on Monday. Farther south, 84 percent of 
mid-Atlantic streams were similarly low. In the Ohio Valley, 39 
percent of sites were in the lowest 25 percent on record. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Low streamflow conditions are allowing salt water to begin  
encroaching up rivers, potentially affecting drinking water 
supplies in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., Philadelphia and parts of Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The dry conditions have resulted in high to very high fire  
danger in central and western Maryland, northern Virginia, the West 
Virginia Panhandle and adjacent southern Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Not everyone is dry; the April-July period was among the 10  
wettest in Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Minnesota, Iowa and Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> Murder Charges in Ala. Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PELHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Alan Eugene Miller left for work with a 7-Up  
and a few sausage biscuits -- just like any other day, his mother 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But when he got to the office early yesterday, Miller allegedly  
had a weapon. Police say he shot two of his co-workers to death, 
then drove five miles to a former workplace and gunned down another 
man. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrest of her son left Barbara Miller bewildered.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't understand what's going on,'' she said at their home  
in Billingsley, about 50 miles south of the shooting in Pelham. 
``Alan didn't bother anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting spree in this Birmingham suburb took place one week  
and about 145 miles down the road from an Atlanta office massacre 
that left nine people dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Police charged the 34-year-old with three counts of capital  
murder. He was arrested after officers spotted him driving on 
nearby Interstate 65 and forced him to pull over. The heavyset 
Miller scuffled with officers briefly and a handgun was found in 
his small truck, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators did not describe a motive, and police asked  
employees at both companies not to discuss the shootings. Both were 
closed this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney appointed to represent Miller, Mickey Johnson, said  
he had not discussed the crime in any detail with his client. He 
described Miller as ``confused'' when he spoke with him at the 
police department. 
</P>
<P>
	Sherrie Williams, a neighbor of the Millers, was surprised at  
his arrest and said the suspect had always been ``real nice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We leave for work about the same time. He always speaks,'' she  
said. ``He doesn't strike you as a fellow who would do something 
like they say he has done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pelham Police Chief Allan Wade said the suspect worked at  
Ferguson Enterprises, a heating and air-conditioning company where 
the first two victims were shot to death. Officers arrived only 
minutes after being summoned at 7:04 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	While officers secured that crime scene, Pelham's 911 dispatcher  
got a second emergency call concerning a shooting at Post Airgas 
Inc., a gas company five miles from Ferguson Enterprises. The third 
victim was found there. Miller's mother said he worked there until 
earlier this year, when he was laid off for economic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Wade said the gunman at Post Airgas matched the description of  
the suspect who fled Ferguson and that his car was spotted entering 
I-65. The suspect initially failed to stop for police but then 
pulled onto the shoulder, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wade identified the victims as Lee Holdbrooks, 32, of Pelham,  
Christopher Yancy, 28, of Alabaster -- both employees at Ferguson -- 
and Terry Jarvis, 39, of Montevallo, who worked at Post Airgas. 
</P>
<P>
	Pelham is a city of about 10,000 that is part of sprawling  
suburbs in wooded hills south of Birmingham. The area is a mix of 
upscale subdivisions, commercial districts and rural farmland. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody around here is just regular working people,'' said  
Cathy McKay, owner of a carpet store across the street from Post 
Airgas. ``You feel safe coming out here at night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting, she said, ``is just beyond my comprehension.''  
</P>
<P>
	The shootings came a week after day trader Mark Barton fatally  
shot nine people and injured 13 others at two brokerage firms in 
Atlanta in one of the worst office massacres in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Herder, a day trader who worked with Barton, was released  
from the hospital Wednesday and found the Pelham shootings a 
troubling echo of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``To a degree it's really frightening that all of a sudden that  
someone is copying this,'' he said. ``I can't believe some idiot 
has started to copy it.''

<HEADLINE> Student's Software Aces Microsoft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOCORRO, N.M. (AP) -- David beat Goliath again, this time online.  
</P>
<P>
	A free system developed by New Mexico Tech graduate student Cort  
Dougan continued running under repeated attacks from Internet 
intruders after a Microsoft computer had repeated software failures 
during an impromptu computer security competition this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Dougan said he's not a part of the security challenge, but will  
be involved in fixing or diagnosing any security flaws the contest 
uncovers. 
</P>
<P>
	The battle began Tuesday, when Microsoft challenged crackers --  
people who use the Internet to break into other people's computers 
-- to break into a computer running a test version of its new 
Windows 2000 operating system. Windows is the core of Microsoft's 
business and Windows 2000 is the latest version of its operating 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	Within hours, a Wisconsin company also challenged crackers to  
break into a computer running LinuxPPC, a version of a free 
operating system that runs on Macintosh computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's computer crashed at 10:45 a.m., then crashed again  
and again. The Mac, running on Dougan's software, continued 
operating Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A Microsoft spokeswoman blamed the crashes on storms and  
electrical outages Tuesday in the Seattle area, where the computer 
is located. 
</P>
<P>
	But a log posted on the computer showed at least nine crashes  
caused by problems with Microsoft software, not the weather. 
Questioned about that, the spokeswoman said the computer was 
expected to be off line for some periods of time ``as customer 
feedback is assessed and integrated into the system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also acknowledged crackers repeatedly attacked the computer,  
but said company officials did not give her further information on 
the effect of those attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Linux computer logged 6,755 individual attackers by midday  
Thursday but continued running, said Jeff Carr, president of the 
Wisconsin company sponsoring the LinuxPPC challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Linux and Windows are computer operating systems, the underlying  
software that handles a computer's housekeeping chores, such as 
moving data around, printing and displaying information on the 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
	Finnish computer programmer Linus Torvalds decided to create his  
own operating system in 1991. The result came to be known as Linux, 
and Torvalds not only gave it away for free, but also gave away the 
underlying source code, the written instructions that make it work.

<HEADLINE> Houston Sees NFL Opportunity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Bob McNair, a Houston businessman who's been the  
underdog from the beginning, might have moved ahead of Los Angeles 
in his efforts to win the NFL's 32nd franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL turned away Thursday from its exclusive focus on the Los  
Angeles Coliseum as the stadium for a proposed franchise in Los 
Angeles, the latest in a series of setbacks for the California 
group trying to put together a plan the NFL will accept. 
</P>
<P>
	The move got the attention of Houston officials, who nonetheless  
remain cautious. 
</P>
<P>
	``It ain't over 'til it's over,'' Harris County Judge Robert  
Eckels said Friday. ``It's playing out as we anticipated all along. 
We've still got to get the deal on the ground and be ready to pull 
the trigger. Los Angeles has a lot of hurdles still to get through. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've always felt we had the advantage.''  
</P>
<P>
	McNair was in Columbia, S.C., where Saturday he was to speak and  
receive an honorary doctor of humane letters degree. Steve 
Patterson, vice president of McNair's Houston NFL Holdings, said 
he's still focused on being ready if Houston gets the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think things are going well for us,'' Patterson said. ``The  
issue for us is to wait for Sept. 15 (LA's deadline) and hopefully 
our friends around the league can get us 24 votes. This has been an 
exciting process the last two years. '' 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL rejected McNair's proposal in March, electing to give  
the franchise to Los Angeles if the city could put together a 
suitable plan that offered tax dollars and an acceptable stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles Coliseum was selected as the proposed site for the  
team but the NFL plans now to look at sites it had previously 
rejected. The league earlier declined to sign a non-binding letter 
of intent proposed by state negotiator Bill Chadwick. Chadwick 
later resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a very strong proposal on the table,'' Houston Mayor  
Lee Brown said. ``The voters have approved a taxing authority, we 
have the land, a proven ability to build a baseball stadium -- just 
look downtown at the new baseball park -- and we have a businessman 
who has the tools to own a team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Houston Astros will move into the new stadium next season.  
</P>
<P>
	Brown said Friday he saw chinks in the Los Angeles plan when  
Chadwick resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me that was a clear indication that they couldn't pull it  
(the Coliseum plan) together,'' Brown said. ``Bad news for them, 
good news for Houston. I'm happy for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While California hopefuls struggled to put together a package  
the NFL will accept, McNair has had a complete proposal since 
March. He has plans for a $310 million retractable roof stadium 
adjacent to the Astrodome. 
</P>
<P>
	There is $195 million available in tax money and McNair has  
guaranteed sellouts in the new stadium for five years, clearing the 
way for local television broadcasts of games. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles has been without pro football since 1995 when the  
Rams moved from Anaheim to St. Louis and the Raiders returned to 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston has been without pro football since the Oilers moved to  
Tennessee after the 1996 season, ending a 37-year presence.

<HEADLINE> Canseco Could Return Before Sept. 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Jose Canseco's recovery from back  
surgery is going so well that the slugger thinks he could return to 
the Tampa Bay Devil Rays sooner than expected to resume his quest 
for 500 career home runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'm two or three weeks ahead of schedule. If it were  
up to me, I'd be in the lineup in 10 or 11 days. But I only work 
here,'' the 35-year-old designated hitter said before Friday 
night's game against the Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco had surgery for a herniated disc on July 11. Doctors  
said at the time that the earliest they expected him to be able to 
play again was Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Although trainers have been encouraged by his progress in  
rehabilitation workouts, the club is urging him to not get too far 
ahead of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been amazing to see, but he still has more hurdles to  
cross,'' manager Larry Rothschild, noting Canseco hasn't even begun 
to swing a bat yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's progressed very rapidly. But if holding him back means we  
don't lose him (again), the obvious decision is you take your 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco led the AL with 31 homers when he was injured and hasn't  
given up hope that he can come back and regain the lead from Ken 
Griffey, Jr., who had 35 before Seattle played the New York Yankees 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	He watched former teammate Mark McGwire hit his 500th career  
homer on television Thursday night and admitted he won't be 
satisfied with his career until he reaches the milestone, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco, the only player in major league history to hit 30-plus  
homers in a season for four different teams, is 72 away from the 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before I die, I want to hit 500 home runs. These injuries will  
not keep me from it. I don't care if I have to have back surgery 
every year. It will not keep me from doing it,'' Canseco said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll play until I'm 45. ... I don't care what's in my future --  
a broken leg, a broken ankle, a broken wrist, three or four more 
back surgeries. I guarantee you I'll get 500 home runs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview from his hospital bed the day after surgery,  
Canseco said he might consider retirement if he couldn't come back 
and swing the bat the way he thinks he's capable. 
</P>
<P>
	His progress in rehab, however, has bolstered his confidence  
that he still has some good years ahead of him.

<HEADLINE> Lott Wants Farm Aid Reduced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the latest indication that Republican  
budget strategy is in trouble, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott 
says he would like to see a reduction in the $7.4 billion farm aid 
package his chamber has approved. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was too much,'' Lott, R-Miss., told reporters  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott voted for the emergency package when the Senate approved  
it, 89-8, on Wednesday. But in a discussion with reporters about 
the GOP's tactics for this fall's likely budget clash with 
President Clinton, Lott said of the farm assistance, ``I'd like to 
see it go down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott's comments came as he discussed the struggle to write  
spending bills that honor the party's pledge to not spend Social 
Security surpluses. Because of the mounting costs of the farm 
measure and other GOP proposals, he said ``It is going to be a 
challenge'' for Republicans to avoid spending the Social Security 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The farm assistance, approved in response to low commodity  
prices, must now be finalized by Senate-House negotiators. Although 
it sailed easily through the Senate, passage came only after 
lawmakers rejected an $11 billion Democratic alternative that had 
the backing of Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tendencies and pressures are to go the other way,'' Lott  
conceded. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, called the  
Senate's emergency farm measure ``the atomic bomb that blows up the 
whole strategy.'' Republicans have planned to not touch next year's 
Social Security surplus, but use the rest of the budget surplus to 
pay for spending and a tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	The Congressional Budget Office has projected a $14 billion  
budget surplus next year, not counting Social Security's surplus. 
Republicans plan to use that money to help pay for their tax cut 
and spending bills for fiscal 2000, which begins Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	But their plans for various bills have already dipped into next  
year's surplus well beyond $14 billion, because there may not be 
enough votes to pass the measures without the extra funds. That has 
raised the risk they would dip into the Social Security money, 
something members of both parties have pledged not to do. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said some pressure would be eased because he expects next  
year's surplus to end up being even larger than current 
projections, as has often been the case over the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, President Clinton said Republicans ``very  
explicitly want to raid the Social Security surplus to pay for huge 
tax cuts and a risky economic scheme.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bracing for a likely fall budget clash with Clinton, Lott also  
said Republicans would avoid an Oct. 1 federal shutdown by 
temporarily giving agencies the same money they get now. 
</P>
<P>
	That would give Republicans and the president time to negotiate  
spending disputes that are expected to linger as the new fiscal 
year begins. Congress has sent Clinton only two of the 13 annual 
spending bills for 2000, and several big ones -- covering the 
Education and Housing and Urban Development departments and many 
other agencies -- are likely to be unresolved on Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Keeping agencies running at this year's levels would make it  
difficult for Clinton to veto stopgap spending legislation and 
prompt a shutdown, Lott said. Republicans want to avoid a 
government closure because they were hurt politically by the 1995 
and 1996 shutdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes away some of his leverage,'' Lott said.

<HEADLINE> Competing Claims of Tax Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A look at some of the competing claims -- all accurate, depending  
on how you look at them -- about the effect on individuals and the 
federal government of the Republicans' 10-year, $792 billion tax 
cut package. 

</P>
<P>
                           *Individuals    	
</P>
<P>
	Republicans: Assuming 1 percentage point income tax cuts and  
income tax brackets are adjusted, married couples with two children 
earning $75,000 a year would see a 27.1 percent reduction in the 
taxes they pay. People earning $100,000 a year would see an 18.5 
percent reduction in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats: Assuming 1 percentage point income tax cuts, repeal  
of estate tax, reduction of capital gains taxes and other changes, 
58 percent of tax benefit would go people in the top 10 percent 
income bracket -- about 11.5 million families, according to the 
Treasury Department. The lowest-earning 22.5 million families, 
meanwhile, get less than 1 percent of the benefits. 

</P>
<P>
 *Government    	
</P>
<P>
	Republicans: With a $2.9 trillion surplus forecast over 10  
years, two-thirds can be set aside to prepare Social Security and 
Medicare for baby boom retirements assuming both programs are 
reformed with some supplemental private investment accounts. The 
remaining third should go for tax cuts, pay down public debt and 
limited other needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats: A $2.9 trillion surplus over 10 years must be set  
aside entirely for Social Security, Medicare, paying down debt and 
ensuring adequate government spending. A large tax cut, according 
to a White House analysis, could trigger deficit rules requiring 
mandatory cuts in 2002 totaling $18.7 billion in programs such as 
Medicare, veterans benefits, immigration, student loans and crop 
insurance.

<HEADLINE> Online Pharmacy Clients: Beware </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If you recently bought an at-home AIDS test  
called EZ Med over the Internet, expect a letter from the 
government urging you not to use it. That AIDS test is illegal and, 
worse, studies show it can't detect the deadly virus as it claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Another cautionary tale: the 53-year-old Chicago man who died  
after taking the impotence pill Viagra he ordered over the 
Internet. There's no way to know, but the government wonders if 
asking his doctor instead for the little blue sex pill would have 
protected the man, who apparently had heart disease risks that make 
Viagra dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	And if you bought another unapproved HIV test called Ana-Sal  
from the HIVCybermall Web site, the Food and Drug Administration is 
trying to contact you, too, seeking evidence in an investigation of 
that test's sale. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet has opened a whole new world for Americans seeking  
better health. You can search topnotch medical journals for the 
latest advice, or e-mail your doctor. Your physician can fax a 
prescription to a legitimate online drugstore that ships your 
monthly medicine -- and a few computer mouse clicks lets you add 
some shampoo or toothpaste to the order without ever leaving home. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Internet also is a hot spot for virtual back-alley drug  
sales and snake oil, a Wild West where legitimate online drugstores 
face stiff competition from Web sites that don't require genuine 
prescriptions for legal U.S. drugs or that even sell illegal ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers are enthusiastically embracing that freedom to play  
doctor -- but health officials and congressional critics say it 
could kill. You could order a drug that's dangerous for your 
condition. You might even get a counterfeit or contaminated drug -- 
there's no way to know, says Rep. Ron Klink, D-Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	So the government is taking new steps to protect and educate  
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key here is consumers need to beware,'' says FDA associate  
commissioner William Hubbard. 
</P>
<P>
	For consumers, that message may bring some unpleasant surprises.  
Part of the Internet's lure is anonymity. But when the FDA stopped 
sales of those two unapproved AIDS tests last month, it got names 
and addresses of the Web sites' customers, and is writing them to 
say don't trust the tests' accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Another lure is not having to make a doctor's appointment. Some  
Web sites don't require prescriptions at all. Others provide 
consumer questionnaires that a staff doctor supposedly reads to 
decide whether the consumer truly should get the drug, a kind of 
virtual prescription. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem: It's illegal to sell certain U.S. drugs without a  
valid prescription, defined under federal law as written by a 
doctor with a relationship with the patient. A questionnaire filled 
out by a complete stranger doesn't count, Hubbard says. Plus, it is 
illegal for doctors to prescribe for patients in a state where 
they're not licensed to practice. 
</P>
<P>
	For a year, states have been struggling to enforce those laws,  
revoking some doctors' licenses and suing to shut down illegitimate 
Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA hopes next week to begin operating a $100,000 computer  
system to help by unveiling illegitimate sites to the proper 
authorities. Domestically, if states can't shut down a bad site, 
the FDA says it will use federal authority to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Klink is sponsoring legislation to force online pharmacies to  
disclose who actually sells the drugs and where they're licensed to 
practice, just as your neighborhood Rite Aid posts its pharmacy 
license in the store, to help consumers and state regulators know 
who they're dealing with. 
</P>
<P>
	But everybody acknowledges the steps will do little to curb  
foreign Web sites, which ship everything from tranquilizers to 
steroids in unmarked packages that can slip past U.S. Customs. 
``Congress needs to step in there,'' Hubbard says. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, what's a consumer to do?  
</P>
<P>
	Read the Web site's fine print to see if the online pharmacy is  
licensed in your state. ``Sites like drugstore.com are licensed in 
all 50 states -- they'd be fine,'' Klink explains. 
</P>
<P>
	Remember the importance of valid prescriptions.  
</P>
<P>
	And the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy just started  
a voluntary ``seal of approval'' for online pharmacies that meet 
certain quality criteria. 
</P>
<P>
	Watch for planned FDA advertisements and brochures to educate  
consumers that they know more about used cars than Internet drugs, 
something Hubbard says has to change. ``There is some personal 
responsibility here.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Woman Sues Nation of Islam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- On a drizzly day five years ago,  
Marceline Donaldson closed up her antiques shop early so she could 
attend a speech by controversial Nation of Islam leader Louis 
Farrakhan. 
</P>
<P>
	Donaldson, who is black, became part of the controversy when,  
after being turned away at the door of the theater, she filed suit 
against Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam, claiming they violated 
her civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very emotional thing to be turned away,'' Donaldson's  
husband, 66-year-old Robert Bennett, testified Thursday at 
Middlesex Superior Court. ``It brought back old wounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett was with his wife when she was refused entrance to the  
1,400-seat Strand Theater -- where Farrakhan was speaking about 
black-on-black violence -- by a Nation of Islam security guard on 
March 10, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett said he was told by a guard that he could enter the  
theater in Boston's Dorchester section, but his wife couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `No -- we came together, we're going to go in  
together,''' he testified, adding that both then went home. ``I 
could've gone in, but I did not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Donaldson, who says she is in her 60s and a former civil rights  
activist, testified Wednesday that ``being turned away at the door 
by a black man was overwhelming. When he moved me aside, my blood 
pressure started to go up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cambridge resident is seeking unspecified damages.  
</P>
<P>
	Nation of Islam attorneys have said the event, though held at a  
city-owned building, was protected under First Amendment guarantees 
of freedom of religion and freedom of assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mosque had the right to hold this as a religious  
meeting,'' said defense lawyer Wilbur Edwards Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if the Nation of Islam had intentionally excluded  
women from the gathering, Don Muhammad, the head of the Nation of 
Islam mosque in Boston, would only say the group had wanted to have 
a private, religious men's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14-person jury, which includes 13 whites, saw a tape of  
parts of Farrakhan's speech that night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nation of Islam leader told the crowd that the women outside  
the theater ``were very, very disturbed because they wanted to see 
their brothers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan said he merely wanted to talk to a group of black men.  
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden, I'm offending some law,'' he said, his voice  
building to a crescendo as the crowd roared. ``What law am I 
offending?''

<HEADLINE> Sandeno Wins Pan Am Swimming Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Kaitlin ``The Energizer'' Sandeno  
electrified the Pan American Games swimming competition Friday 
night, leading a parade of double individual gold medalists. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandeno, winner of the women's 400-meter freestyle Wednesday  
night, added the 800 title in a Pan Ams record and personal-best 8 
minutes, 34.65 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	She is the fourth swimmer, all Americans, to complete that  
difficult double at the Pan Am Games. The others were Debbie Meyer 
in 1967, Tiffany Cohen in 1983 and Jane Skillman in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandeno's victory in the 800 extended the United States'  
unbeaten streak to nine in the event at the games, but it couldn't 
completely salve the woes of the U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
	After 26 events, the United States has only seven golds, its  
worst showing in Pan Am swimming. To add to the Americans' dismal 
showing, their men failed to medal in the 50-meter freestyle, their 
third such failure at this meet, and the first time ever in that 
event. 
</P>
<P>
	In the previous 12 Pan Am Games, U.S. swimmers did not reach the  
medal stand in only two events, once in 1995 and once in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans got a second gold Friday night when the women's  
400 medley relay team of Denali Knapp, 100 breaststroke champion 
Staciana Stitts, 100 butterfly gold medalist Karen Campbell and 
Tammie Spatz set a Pan Ams record of 4:06.08. 
</P>
<P>
	The bubbly, 16-year-old Sandeno, from Lake Forest, Calif., was  
the star for the Americans, becoming the first U.S. swimmer to earn 
two golds at these games. 
</P>
<P>
	She was joined as a double individual gold medalist by Joanne  
Malar of Canada and Fernando Scherer of Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Malar, winner of the women's 400 individual medley in Pan Ams  
record time earlier in the week, took the 200 IM with another games 
record, 2:14.18, breaking the mark she set in the morning 
preliminaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Malar, also winner of a relay gold and an individual bronze at  
these Games, now has 15 medals in three Pan Ams. 
</P>
<P>
	Scherer, the men's 100 freestyle champion in Pan Ams record  
time, won the 50 freestyle at 22.24 after setting the meet record 
of 22.22 in the preliminaries. Scherer's victory gave the 
Brazilians a sweep of the four men's freestyle races. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's other winners were Canada's Shamek Pietucha in the  
men's 200 butterfly at 1:59.10, a bit slower than the games record 
1:58.50 he set in the morning qualifying, and Rodolfo Cabrera in 
the men's 100 backstroke for Cuba's first gold medal in swimming. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandeno used to play soccer and was a member of the 1994 U.S.  
World Cup youth team. She gave up soccer for swimming because she 
liked the individuality of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you score a goal in soccer, it's for the other players on  
the team,'' she said. ``I like swimming because it's all up to 
yourself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sandeno will get a quick chance to continue her surprising  
success. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, she leaves for the U.S. Swimming Championships,  
which began Friday at Minneapolis. Sandeno is uncertain which 
events she will contest there. She is entered in several, but 
prefers the 800 freestyle and 400 individual medley. 
</P>
<P>
	At the spring nationals this year, she won the 400 IM, was  
runner-up in the 800 and 1,500 freestyles and third in the 400 
freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	Winning Friday night was ``an awesome feeling,'' Sandeno said.  
``It was something I didn't expect. I just wanted to have my best 
times here and represent my country well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She accomplished both goals.

<HEADLINE> Wallace Aims To Win Indy's Big One </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Winning big races is what guys like Rusty  
Wallace live for. There aren't too many bigger than Saturday's 
Brickyard 400. 
</P>
<P>
	The race at Indianapolis Motor Speedway carries a $6.1 million  
purse, second only in stock car racing to the Daytona 500. And in 
only its sixth year the event has become one of the most 
prestigious on the Winston Cup circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got our 49th career win back at Bristol in April and have  
been trying hard to get that 50th win ever since,'' Wallace said. 
``Can you imagine how cool that would be to get the 50th victory in 
the Brickyard 400 at Indy? 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a hell of a way to go down into the history books,  
I can tell you that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It would put Wallace, the 1989 Winston Cup champion and one of  
the sport's most popular drivers, on an elite list. 
</P>
<P>
	The winners of the first five Brickyard races are three-time  
series champion Jeff Gordon (1994, 1998), seven-time series 
champion Dale Earnhardt (1995), current series leader Dale Jarrett 
(1996) and longtime favorite Ricky Rudd (1997). 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace understands the history of Indianapolis Motor Speedway  
more than most stock car drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	The principal owner of his team, Penske Racing South, is Roger  
Penske, whose open-wheel team has won a record 10 Indianapolis 
500s. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be great to win it for Roger,'' Wallace said. ``But  
it's just as important to me and the rest of our team. This is the 
third and final super big race of the year, and you can't begin to 
know how much we want to win it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace lists the Daytona 500, which he has never won, and the  
Coca-Cola 600 in Charlotte, N.C., which he won in 1990, as the 
other two standout races on the Winston Cup schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``You ask any of the guys in the garage area which races they  
want to win most and I'll guarantee you that you'll get the same 
answer from them all. These races have become our Triple Crown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace is 10th in the season points and would love to use a  
victory in Saturday's 400-mile race for a good start back toward 
the top of the standings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a lot of disappointments this year, a lot of things  
happening to us that we couldn't do anything about,'' Wallace said. 
``We had a super shot at winning the Daytona 500 back in February 
and lost the thing with 10 laps to go. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then we had a pretty good car in Charlotte for the 600 (in  
May) before we crashed out. So, what's left is that third and final 
leg at Indy this week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has come close at Indy, finishing second to Earnhardt by 0.37  
seconds -- about two car lengths on the 2 1/2-mile oval. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's one race that really sticks out in my mind as one of  
the biggest fish that ever got away,'' Wallace said. ``We got to 
the front and set sail, led a ton of laps and stretched our lead 
out before having to pit under the green. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had another quick pit stop but, just as we were on our way  
to the pits, two cars in front of us collided on pit road. That 
slowed us down enough that Dale got the lead away from us. We 
reeled Dale in but just ran out of laps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Wallace finished eighth, but said he deserved better.  
</P>
<P>
	``We got up into the top five and were motoring right along when  
we had a right-front tire blow out on us,'' he said. ``We were 
lucky to keep our car out of the fence. An eighth-place finish 
wasn't what we were looking for, but it could have been a lot 
worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon will start from the pole, alongside last year's  
runner-up, Mark Martin, and just ahead of David Green and Jarrett. 
Wallace qualified 17th in the 43-car field, just ahead of Earnhardt 
and three spots behind Rudd.

<HEADLINE> Saints, Chiefs Brawl in Workouts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIVER FALLS, Wis. (AP) -- Tempers flared so often and so  
violently Friday during workouts between the New Orleans Saints and 
the Kansas City Chiefs that coaches called off Saturday's planned 
scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
	Intermittent fights broke out among players during a morning  
practice, and an afternoon slugfest got so bad that coaches from 
both teams had to take the field to pull players apart. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't just one-on-one fighting, it was a brawl,'' Saints  
defensive coordinator Zaven Yaralian said. 
</P>
<P>
	Saints wide receiver Keith Poole suffered a cut near one eye on  
the final play of Friday's practice in what New Orleans coach Mike 
Ditka called a cheap shot. When practice ended, Poole charged 
Chiefs players, intent on settling the score. Coaches and other 
players had to separate fighters again. 
</P>
<P>
	Some players said the fights broke out because the Saints were  
doing so well in practice. But the fights started less than three 
minutes into the morning practice and some Saints veterans said bad 
feelings between the teams go back two years, to a similar camp 
workout which the Chiefs dominated. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the day, there was general shoving and mass punching  
on two practice fields, as each team's offense worked against the 
other's defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in the day, the fights did not seem to concern Ditka.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's only natural,'' Ditka said. ``These kids are all trying  
to show what they can do on both sides of the ball and it becomes a 
macho thing. They go through that, `You can't hold me,' and all of 
a sudden temperatures get a little short and things go crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But after the violence escalated, Ditka said he'd never seen  
anything like it and hoped it wouldn't happen again. 
</P>
<P>
	Saints players downplayed the brawling, but said they felt they  
were just taking it to the Chiefs, maybe a bit more than Kansas 
City expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we set the tempo out there and the Chiefs were  
bothered by it,'' offensive tackle William Roaf said. ``But if they 
can't keep up they better spend some more time on the practice 
field trying to get ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the worst of the fights, the Saints offense had looked  
especially sharp against Kansas City. They opened the afternoon 
practice with an 80-yard touchdown completion from Billy Joe Hobert 
to Eddie Kennison, followed by an 80-yard run by rookie running 
back Ricky Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka and his staff evaluate every player in every position  
every four days, and having a couple of days of good showings 
against the Chiefs could be the boost some of them need, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing Ditka saw that he liked was the way Williams looked  
against the Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, the Heisman Trophy winner out of Texas that the Saints  
made their only draft pick, has worked hard throughout camp. On 
Friday he showed speed, broke tackles and was able to get 
downfield. Williams' pass-catching also has impressed Ditka. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a better receiver than people think he is,'' Ditka said.  
``I don't know where the small-hands rap came from. He catches the 
ball better than most backs I've seen and he runs good routs too. 
</P>
<P>
	``The other thing is I think he has great endurance. He just  
keeps running in practice. He runs all the way down the field. 
Comes back. He runs down the field and comes back. He doesn't say 
anything to anybody. If somebody hits him in the face, I don't 
think he'll say anything. I would not like them to do it two times 
in a row or he'll figure out who it is and run over them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Saturday's scrimmage canceled, the Chiefs planned to return  
to their camp at LaCrosse, Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> Equal Immigration Rights Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has sent Congress a bill  
that would equalize immigration rights for people from Central 
America and Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
	Traveling to the hurricane ravaged region earlier this year,  
Clinton said he would seek to correct an imbalance in immigration 
laws that gave advantage to people who had fled communist regimes 
in Cuba and Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like Nicaraguans and Cubans, many Salvadorans, Guatemalans,  
Hondurans and Haitians fled human rights abuses or unstable 
political economic conditions in the 1980s and 1990s,'' Clinton 
said in a letter to Congress. ``Yet these latter groups received 
lesser treatment than that granted to Nicaraguans and Cubans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Central American and Haitian Parity Act,'' introduced  
Thursday night by Reps. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., and Christopher 
Smith, R-N.J., would offer the same protection to fled violence, 
human rights abuses and unrest in other nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the legislation, migrants from Haiti, El Salvador,  
Guatemala and Honduras who have resided continuously in the United 
States since Dec. 1, 1995, and haven't been convicted of a crime, 
would be eligible to become permanent U.S. residents. 
</P>
<P>
	It would provide similar treatment to Haitians who sought  
protection in the United States in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Immigration and Naturalization Service said it  
will create more consistent procedures for officials to follow when 
dealing with illegal aliens facing deportation. The guidelines will 
end a system that varied from region to region, INS officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The agency is committed to fairness, consistency and  
timeliness,'' said INS Commissioner Doris Meissner. ``The 
procedures announced today will meet these commitments while 
keeping community safety a top priority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The guidelines, which take effect immediately, are interim until  
permanent rules are written and published. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rules deal with individuals who have been ordered  
removed from the country but face delays for various reasons. In 
some cases, for instance, U.S. relations with an alien's country 
can slow the exchange of needed information and delay the process, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's in those situations, officials must decide whether to  
continue to detain the individual or release them if they are not a 
threat to public safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the changes are reviews at various levels of the agency to  
ensure fair treatment. It also provides a timeline where the agency 
must continually review a case to determine if an alien should 
continue to be detained or be released. 
</P>
<P>
	Release ``was not always uniformly applied by different  
districts,'' said John O'Malley, an INS spokesman. ``This makes 
sure when it's appropriate they do.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Media Violence Affects Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress is finalizing juvenile justice  
legislation to address the problem of media violence, but a new 
Senate report says parents also must share the burden of shielding 
children from such images. 
</P>
<P>
	``The effect of media violence on our children is no longer open  
to debate,'' said Thursday's report from the Senate Judiciary 
Committee's Republican staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-page document concluded that the media dominate  
children's lives, are ``exceedingly violent'' and that such images 
lead to real world violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that this report ... will further the discussion about  
the flood of media violence in this country and what should be done 
about it,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the panel's chairman. 
Hatch requested the report after the fatal shooting at Colorado's 
Columbine High School that left 15 people dead in April. 
</P>
<P>
	He said more than 1,000 studies over the past 40 years that  
examined the effects of violence on children have not changed the 
predominant finding. 
</P>
<P>
	``Exposure to media portrayals of violence increases aggressive  
behavior in children,'' he said. ``As one expert put it, arguing 
against the link between media violence and the violent actions of 
our youth is 'like arguing against gravity.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The report highlights provisions in a Senate-passed juvenile  
justice that address the issue, and makes additional 
recommendations to Congress. It also includes suggestions for 
parents and the entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-page report recommends that:  
</P>
<P>
	--Congress begin a national media campaign to educate parents and  
create a national clearinghouse on children and entertainment 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	--The television, motion picture, music and video game industries  
be encouraged to rate their products using a universal system; they 
now use separate systems. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Federal Trade Commission report twice a year on media  
violence and the entertainment industry's efforts to reduce it. 
</P>
<P>
	--Federal property, when used in programming for children, be  
offered at reduced rates. 
</P>
<P>
	--Congress ban advertising for adult programming broadcast at  
times when children are most likely to be watching television or 
listening to the radio. The ban also would apply to publications 
designed for children. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate juvenile justice bill would toughen penalties for  
juvenile offenders while providing states with $1 billion a year to 
fight juvenile crime and prevent delinquency. A House-Senate 
committee began Thursday to iron out differences between that bill 
and a different version passed by the House. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill also has provisions aimed at limiting youth  
exposure to violence, including a proposal to grant a limited 
antitrust exemption to the entertainment industries so they can 
develop voluntary guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation also calls for a national media campaign against  
youth violence, would ban use of federal property in violent movies 
or TV shows and require Internet service providers to offer 
filtering technology to block access to explicit material. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The report, ``Children, Violence, and the Media,'' is available  
from the Judiciary Committee's Web site at http://www.senate.gov/ 
7/8judiciary.

<HEADLINE> Doctors Happy McGwire Drops Andro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Now that Mark McGwire has joined the elite 500-homer club after  
saying no to andro, doctors are hoping sales of the supplement will 
slide. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message Mark McGwire sends to our young people by walking  
away from this substance is a powerful one,'' Barry R. McCaffrey, 
the White House drug policy director, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all need to be aware that just because a superstar stops  
using andro, the problem doesn't just go away. Countless young 
people still take this potentially dangerous substance -- banned by 
the NFL, the Olympics, the NCAA and professional tennis -- in order 
to improve their athletic performance. We must continue to focus on 
the risks at hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the year that has passed since The Associated Press reported  
that McGwire was using androstenedione during his 70-homer season, 
sales of the testosterone booster surged more than 1,000 percent to 
more than $50 million, according to industry figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Easy access to the over-the-counter supplement through the  
Internet and nutrition stores worried doctors that thousands of 
young people might be risking long-term illness. Andro 
manufacturers say more than 100 players in the majors and minors 
are using the supplement, which converts to testosterone in the 
body and is considered an anabolic steroid by most steroid 
specialists. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire said he was unhappy being cast as the poster boy for  
andro, even though he wasn't breaking any baseball rules. He said 
he hasn't used andro in four months, and will never again take it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still believe there's nothing wrong with it,'' he said in  
St. Louis before hitting homers No. 500 and 501. ``But if I have a 
message for kids, it's that you don't necessarily have to follow 
what somebody who's in the public eye does. If you're an adult, you 
elect to choose your own destiny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire didn't explain why he waited four months to say he was  
dropping andro if he wanted to send out the message to youngsters. 
When he arrived in spring training, he adamantly said he would 
continue using the supplement. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's four months' worth of kids who took andro because of  
him,'' said Dr. Gary Wadler, a leading steroid specialist at NYU 
Medical School and a consultant to several professional sports. 
``I'm delighted he said it today, rather than never saying it at 
all, but I would have preferred he said it at the beginning of the 
season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Wade Exum, head of the U.S. Olympic Committee's drug control  
program, also applauded McGwire's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's great,'' Exum said. ``I can't say it'll help  
tremendously because it's somewhat after the fact. But if he's not 
using the stuff, and he's still having a hell of a season, then 
maybe the message will counterbalance some of the things that went 
on last year. The problem is, after last year, the sales of that 
stuff jumped. All you can do now is follow the sales and see if 
they go down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's use of andro through the winter and spring training,  
though, may have given him a competitive edge that would help him 
during the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the whole basis for year-round, out-of-competition  
testing,'' Wadler said. ``People in other sports were very savvy to 
announced drug testing, so what they did was take a lot of this 
stuff, bulk up, and when the season started they stopped. They 
continued to work out and derive much of the benefit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An Iowa State study of andro published a few months ago showed  
that in small doses, andro didn't increase strength, but still 
might lead to heart disease and other health problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem with that study is that is not how people tend to  
use these things,'' Wadler said. ``They usually take many multiples 
of the recommended daily dose, 10 to 100 times what's on the label. 
Anybody who thinks people taking andro with the eye toward 
improving performance or developing musculature are not taking 
multiples is kind of putting their head in the sand. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he took a lot, and he took it many times a day, and he did  
it for a long time, he could derive the benefits, which is 
increased muscle mass in conjunction with weightlifting, and he 
could have a carryover through the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bigger problem for baseball, Wadler said, is the issue of  
whether andro is just a tiny part of anabolic steroid use. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time now for baseball to step up to the plate. Baseball  
needs to get its act together and stop nipping around the edges. It 
has to get to the heart of the matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That, Wadler said, involves banning andro and similar  
substances, and testing for the whole range of anabolic steroids. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do I think baseball has steroid abuse in it? If it didn't, it  
would be the first sport that we know of at a high level where 
there was no steroid use,'' Wadler said. ``There may not be a whole 
lot of people, but to think they're immune from the behaviors that 
we see in all kinds of other sports is the ultimate of naivete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, neither baseball commissioner Bud Selig nor union  
officials have shown a willingness yet to ban andro or test for 
anabolic steroids. A Harvard study of andro, commissioned by 
baseball, is still months from release, and no decision is expected 
before that. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig on Wednesday declined to talk about McGwire's decision,  
but NL president Len Coleman praised the Cardinals' first baseman's 
act. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mark's focus is on contributions to society,'' Coleman said.  
``He leads by example. The youth of the world are well served by 
Mark's value structure.''

<HEADLINE> Afghani-Arms Investigation Dropped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Federal prosecutors have dropped their  
investigation into whether an ex-congressman and a businessman 
allegedly took kickbacks in a CIA-Afghanistan arms deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have determined that there is insufficient evidence to  
warrant a criminal prosecution,'' Justice Department spokesman 
Myron Marlin said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Abbe Lowell told The Dallas Morning News he doesn't  
acknowledge that his client, former Rep. Charles Wilson, was a 
focus of the investigation. 
</P>

	``I was never notified that he was a target, and I don't concede  
that he was,'' Lowell said. ``The fact that whatever they were

	For two years, federal authorities were looked into whether  
Wilson and Texas businessman Joe Christie split as much as $4 
million in commissions for persuading Congress to buy antiaircraft 
weapons for the Afghan rebels in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson was a supporter of the Afghan rebels during the 10-year  
Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
	Ignoring State Department pleas, he put on Afghan garb and  
sneaked into the war zone, and numerous articles and books have 
documented the role Wilson played in persuading Congress to earmark 
$40 million for the CIA to give Swiss-made Oerlikon 20 mm 
antiaircraft guns to the Afghan rebels in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Now 66, Wilson is a registered lobbyist in Washington.  
</P>
<P>
	Wilson has had close ties to Christie, also 66. The two served  
together in the Texas Senate during the 1970s and Wilson once held 
stock in one of Christie's several companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Christie owns or has owned enterprises ranging from oil and gas  
exploration firms to a company that sells devices to maintain 
batteries.

	Hastert Backs Right To Sue HMOs  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trying to hold his fractured party together,  
House Speaker Dennis Hastert said today that he will bring an HMO 
bill to the floor that includes new rights to sue managed care 
companies. It's the first time a Republican congressional leader 
has backed an expanded right to sue -- something Democrats have been 
insisting on since the managed care debate began more than a year 
ago. The move comes a day after a group of some 20 Republicans, led 
by Rep. Charles Norwood, R-Ga., signed on with minority Democrats 
to back HMO legislation.

<P>
	FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) -- Federal officials today endorsed a plan  
that will allow developers to build housing, hotels and restaurants 
on more than 250 acres of prime national forest land just south of 
the Grand Canyon. The $330 million Canyon Forest Village project on 
land considered a gateway to the canyon includes space for 1,270 
hotel rooms and 270,000 square feet of retail space, enough for 
four large department stores. It also includes 20 acres to house 
people working at Grand Canyon National Park.

	CANTON, Texas (AP) -- Jurors found pharmaceutical giant American  
Home Products Corp. liable today for a Texas woman's heart ailment 
and awarded her $23.36 million in the first case involving the 
diet-drug combination fen-phen to reach a jury. Debbie Lovett, 36, 
blamed the nation's seventh-largest drug maker and subsidiary 
Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories for heart-valve damage she claimed she 
suffered after taking the drugs for more than three months starting 
in October 1995. Jurors determined the company was 100-percent 
liable for Ms. Lovett's injuries.

	Clinton: GOP Tax Cut Will Not Happen  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Just hours after Republicans pushed their  
10-year, $792 billion tax bill through Congress, President Clinton 
declared today that ``this tax cut will not become law.'' Clinton 
repeated his determination to veto the bill as he left the White 
House for a trip to Arkansas. The president said he is willing to 
consider limited tax cuts, but only after Social Security and 
Medicare are safeguarded. Senate majority Leader Trent Lott, 
R-Miss., said today Republicans hope public pressure will force the 
president to do ``one of the Clintonian 180s'' and reverse his 
decision.

	Kosovo Family Withdraws Claim  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The father of the first Albanian Kosovar refugee  
born in the United States has withdrawn his claim that the family 
was all but destitute because promises of aid hadn't come through. 
Naim Karaliu, father of little Amerikan, now acknowledges his 
family's needs had been met -- income, baby food, and rent for their 
two-bedroom apartment, The Dallas Morning News reported today. The 
refugee agency strongly denied the family's claims all along. 
``We're pretty frustrated with the misinformation that's been noted 
in the media,'' said Deborah DeWinter, associated director of 
Church World Services, which oversees the North Texas agency.

	Knesset Speaker To Jam Cell Phones

<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Upset by the constant ringing of cellular  
telephones in the Parliament chamber, Speaker Avraham Burg said 
today he would install an electronic jamming device to render the 
little nuisances unusable. Burg told Israel army radio that 
legislators could still use their cellular phones in most parts of 
the building, but not the chamber. Lawmakers were not pleased. ``We 
need to be in touch with our people 24 hours a day, including 
inside the chamber,'' said one legislator, Taleb El-Sana. Three of 
every 10 Israelis has a mobile phone -- one of the highest rates in 
the world.

	GARY, Ind. (AP) -- The man charged with drunken driving in the  
death of Purdue basketball star Tiffany Young had been in court on 
a public intoxication charge hours before the accident, a newspaper 
reported today. Arnold Eaton walked out of court July 31 after a 
judge refused to let him plead guilty, telling him to talk to a 
lawyer, the Gary Post-Tribune reported. Twelve hours later, Young 
was killed when her car was struck. Eaton is charged with operating 
a vehicle while intoxicated and causing a death. He is free on 
bond.

<HEADLINE> Swissair Offers To Settle in Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Survivors of 229 people killed in last  
year's Swissair Flight 111 disaster have been offered financial 
compensation from the airline, provided they not pursue punitive 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The move, revealed in a pretrial conference Thursday, does not  
represent an admission of guilt, Swissair said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is extraordinary,'' said Lee Kreindler, the lead counsel  
for the plaintiffs, after the offer was made. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear, however, whether the deal would be accepted.  
Kreindler predicted many of the cases will be settled in the coming 
month, although some of the 30 plaintiffs' attorneys said they 
weren't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight 111, en route from New York to Geneva, crashed in  
September off the coast of Nova Scotia after the pilots reported 
smoke in the cockpit. All 229 people on board were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Swissair attorney Desmond Barry said the airline and two of the  
three other co-defendants -- Boeing, which owns the company that 
built the MD-11 jetliner, and Delta Airlines, which had a 
ticket-sharing deal with Swissair -- would not contest whether they 
were to blame for the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``We agree to share liability for the accident and pay full  
compensatory damages for each passenger and crew member,'' Barry 
told a federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
	The offer applies to the 167 claims already filed as well as any  
claims that may be submitted in the future, Swissair said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry also requested that about 120 of the cases be dismissed  
from U.S. court for litigation in France or Switzerland because 
many of the passengers on the plane were from other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one lawyer for the plaintiffs did not appear impressed  
with Swissair's overture. 
</P>
<P>
	``Essentially what the defense contends is that they're willing  
to pay economic damages only and avoid pain and suffering damages 
for the U.S. plaintiffs and essentially ignore the foreign 
plaintiffs,'' said Arthur Wolk of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Swissair is facing claims totaling $16 billion from families of  
U.S. victims suing on grounds of gross negligence, although 
attorneys expected a jury award would be far short of that figure. 
The company said it has reached settlements with relatives of five 
victims in France. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators still have not identified the cause of the fire  
that sent the smoke into the cockpit. But Canadian investigators 
found heat-damaged wiring aboard the crashed MD-11, prompting U.S. 
air safety officials in January to recommend that airlines inspect 
all MD-11 jetliners for electrical wiring problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Swissair said Tuesday that a flight attendant on the MD-11 had  
reported strange smells in the cabin less than a month before the 
fatal crash. No problems were found. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth defendant, Inflight Technologies, which provided the  
plane's electronic entertainment system, was not involved in 
Thursday's offer. The company is defending its case in California 
courts, but an attorney said its client would consider joining the 
deal.

<HEADLINE> Penny Hardaway Traded to Suns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Upon his arrival in Phoenix, Penny Hardaway promised to be  
better. 
</P>
<P>
	``Me and coach Ainge are going to be super. You won't hear a  
peep out of me. Honestly, you won't,'' Hardaway said Thursday night 
following his trade from the Orlando Magic. 
</P>
<P>
	On another busy day of player movement in the NBA, no move was  
bigger than the one sending Hardaway to the Suns for Danny Manning, 
Pat Garrity and two future first-round draft picks. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Rick Fox re-signed with the Lakers for big money, and  
Lorenzen Wright reportedly agreed to join the Lakers, too, at a 
price far below his market value. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell Curry signed with Toronto, Calbert Cheaney turned down a  
trade to Miami and signed with Boston instead, and Terry Porter 
signed with the NBA champion San Antonio Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway got a seven-year, $86 million contract, the largest  
allowed under the league's collective bargaining agreement, and 
will team with Jason Kidd in a star-studded backcourt. 
</P>
<P>
	It was bitter day for the Magic, who parted with the last member  
of the 1995 team that went to the NBA Finals and got relatively 
little in return. 
</P>
<P>
	Suns coach Danny Ainge called Hardaway ``the most skilled  
all-around player in the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden, I really believe this puts us as one of the  
elite teams in the NBA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a major coup for the Suns, who had no room under the  
salary cap to go after free agents, let alone one the stature of 
Hardaway. 
</P>
<P>
	Suns president Jerry Colangelo said the acquisition ``ranks  
right up there with any acquisition we've ever made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Magic tried to work out a deal with the Lakers, Raptors and  
a few other teams, but all dropped out of the bidding by the middle 
of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have nothing against Orlando. I came to Phoenix and fell in  
love with Phoenix,'' Hardaway said. ``I thank the Magic for going 
through with the deal because they didn't have to. They saw the 
same thing I saw; it's time for me to just move on and start a new 
career. I wanted to do it here in Phoenix.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway's image as one of the NBA's rising superstars took a  
beating in recent years. He was accused of orchestrating the 
departure of coach Brian Hill, then sat out most of the 1997-98 
season, but still played in the All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
	He also had an uneven relationship with Magic coach Chuck Daly,  
who resigned after the 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway said he had said and done things in Orlando in recent  
years ``that were out of character for me'' and looked forward to a 
fresh start. 
</P>
<P>
	In other news:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Seattle apparently dropped out of the bidding for free agent  
Mitch Richmond and started scrambling to make other moves, even 
trying to acquire the much maligned Donyell Marshall from Golden 
State for Hersey Hawkins. That offer was turned down, and the 
Sonics also got no commitment from free agent forward Gary Trent 
after making another offer. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Miami emerged as the leading candidate to acquire Richmond,  
but needed to find a third team to broker a sign-and-trade deal 
with the Wizards. The Heat were believed to be willing to part with 
P.J. Brown in a deal for Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Toronto increased its offer to Charles Oakley, offering him  
about $18 million for three years, while Oakley lowered his asking 
price to $24 million for three years. The Raptors and Lakers were 
discussing a sign-and-trade deal that would send the veteran power 
forward to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Fox signed a six-year deal with the Lakers believed to be  
worth $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Porter left the Heat and signed with the Spurs, saying he  
didn't want to commit to Miami because of all the uncertainty over 
what the roster will look like next season. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Shandon Anderson and Jazz remained apart in their contract  
negotiations, although Utah felt its chances of keeping the 
shooting guard had improved. 
</P>
<P>
	-- ESPN reported that Wright has decided to accept a one-year, $2  
million offer from the Lakers. He had been the subject of various 
sign-and-trade proposals that would have earned him millions of 
dollars more. 
</P>
<P>
	Curry got a three-year, $6 million contract. He led the NBA in  
3-point accuracy last season, shooting 47.6 percent, and will be 
teamed in Toronto with Dee Brown, who led the NBA with 135 
3-pointers and 349 3-point attempts last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting a player of great character,'' Toronto general  
manager Glen Grunwald said. ``He'll provide firepower off the 
bench, we're looking forward to having his veteran presence and his 
shooting ability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Celtics coach Rick Pitino didn't commit to inserting Cheaney in  
his starting lineup, but said the six-year veteran, who played 
forward and guard for the Wizards last season, would help fill the 
hole left by Mercer at shooting guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was time for a change,'' Cheaney said. ``The last  
two or three seasons were disappointing for me. It was time for a 
fresh start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The SuperSonics negotiated Thursday with free-agent guard Vernon  
Maxwell, but did not reach an agreement. Two sources, speaking on 
condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press that Seattle also 
offered Hawkins to the Warriors for Marshall. The Sonics also made 
an offer to Trent, who played for Dallas last season, that was not 
immediately accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	With Seattle, Golden State and Sacramento out of the Richmond  
sweepstakes, it appeared Miami was the only team left trying to 
make a sign-and-trade deal with Washington. The Wizards have 
already offered Richmond a three-year, $30 million deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Raptors increased their offer to Oakley by $500,000  
annually, but the sides remained $2 million apart per year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he had his way, he'd sign with Toronto and be traded to Los  
Angeles both for the desirable location and the team's closeness to 
being able to compete for a championship,'' said Oakley's agent, 
Charles Grantham. ``But he still has no problem staying in 
Toronto.''

<HEADLINE>  Gwynn Loyal to Padres Through It All </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Tony Gwynn is one consistent guy.  
</P>
<P>
	He's played for only one team in his 18-year career, the San  
Diego Padres. He's hit better than .300 for 16 straight seasons and 
is tied for Honus Wagner with eight NL batting titles. 
</P>
<P>
	He got two hits in his major league debut on July 19, 1982.  
</P>
<P>
	Hit No. 1 was a double off Philadelphia's Sid Monge. On the  
field that night was Pete Rose, who would become baseball's career 
hit king. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rose trailed the play and said, `Congratulations. Don't catch  
me in one night,''' Gwynn said. ``That's always going to stick with 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday night at Montreal, Gwynn singled in the first inning  
for his 3,000th career hit. He finished the game 4-for-5, giving 
him 3,003 career hits. 
</P>
<P>
	He was in a rush to get it, too, having said he wanted to beat  
longtime contemporary Wade Boggs to the mark. Boggs had 2,997 hits 
going into Friday night's home game for Tampa Bay against 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn became the 22nd member of the 3,000-hit club, and Boggs is  
bound to become the 23rd. 
</P>
<P>
	But getting to 3,000 wasn't a breeze for Gwynn, 39.  
</P>
<P>
	After a hot April, he strained his left calf breaking out of the  
batter's box on May 21 and ended up making two trips to the 
disabled list, missing 44 games. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed all but two of the Padres' franchise-record 14-game  
winning streak in late June-early July. Gwynn, one of the most 
affable and accessible players in the majors, was frustrated. Not 
as much that his drive for 3,000 hit the skids, but because he was 
missing out on an exciting stretch for the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been very uncomfortable, very difficult,'' Gwynn said  
recently. ``I just want to get there as quickly as possible and get 
back to normal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn uttered those words even before Jim Leyritz took a potshot  
just before he was traded from the Padres to the New York Yankees, 
hinting that Gwynn wasn't exactly a team player. 
</P>
<P>
	The same thing often was said about Boggs, a five-time AL  
batting champion and left-hander hitter like Gwynn. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Gwynn tried to imitate Boggs in his early years.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was the hitter I wanted to be like,'' said Gwynn, who won  
his first batting title the year after Boggs won his first. ``He 
became the hunted. I wanted to emulate him. So for me, there's a 
connection because we're both similar in our approach, except that 
Wade's a whole lot more patient. He was the guy I had to chase.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Gwynn, that approach has been to put the ball in play using  
all fields. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it didn't count in his career totals, Gwynn's favorite  
hit was his homer to right field in the first game of last year's 
World Series at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, Gwynn loves to carve hits the other way. He became so  
proficient at hitting between third base and shortstop that he 
began calling it the ``5.5 Hole'' -- in baseball scoring, the third 
baseman is represented by 5 and the shortstop, 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn even has ``5.5 Hole'' patches on the tongue of his cleats.  
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn played basketball and baseball at San Diego State, and it  
wasn't until his senior season that he decided to stick with 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	He loved basketball and thought he might have a shot at the NBA,  
but didn't start half the games due to an injury suffered the 
previous summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was sitting on the bench and thinking, `I've got to think  
about my career here.' It just dawned on me that I probably had a 
better chance at baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``And about halfway through my senior year I started sneaking  
down to the baseball field and hitting in the cage and taking 
ground balls and stuff. So by the time basketball season ended and 
I went out to play baseball, I was kind of ready, where before I 
would just go straight from basketball to baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was a third-round draft pick of the Padres in June 1981, and  
made his big league debut a little more than a year later. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn won his first batting title in 1984. He won the other  
seven in bunches, from 1987-89, and 1994-97. 
</P>
<P>
	As he got older he seemed to get better, never hitting lower  
than .353 from '93-'97. Last year he fell off to .321, but did hit 
.500 in the World Series as the Padres were swept by the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	His best year was 1994, when he was batting .394 when the  
players' strike began. It was the highest in the majors since Ted 
Williams batted .406 in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the break I was hitting .383 and was really on a good  
roll,'' Gwynn said. ``I was hitting the ball hard and using all 
fields. If I was going to hit .400, I knew that was going to be my 
best crack at it. Unfortunately for me and everyone else, we didn't 
finish the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, that was the year I was doing a whole lot of things  
right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For a guy who's hit .339 for his career -- the best among active  
big leaguers -- a lot of people would say he's done a whole lot of 
things right his entire career.

<HEADLINE> Socialite Sues Over Prince Tape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- A socialite's dinner with Prince Andrew  
was secretly videotaped by her jealous husband, according to a 
lawsuit that claims the video and suggestions of a torrid royal 
tryst were given to a British tabloid. 
</P>
<P>
	Melissa M. Lincoln, 40, of Newport Beach filed a Superior Court  
lawsuit Tuesday against J.D. Lincoln, 63, claiming her privacy was 
invaded and she suffered emotional distress when he made her a 
scandal-sheet celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to allegedly giving the video to The Sun in London,  
Lincoln is accused of revealing intimate details about their 
marriage and providing nude photos of Mrs. Lincoln. The suit seeks 
unspecified damages over the July 24 tabloid spread. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Lincoln met Prince Andrew on a flight to Hawaii, her  
attorney Gloria Allred said Thursday. The two had dinner -- and 
nothing else -- and the video was shot from the bushes outside Mrs. 
Lincoln's bungalow as the prince left for the evening, Ms. Allred 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no telephone listing for J.D. Lincoln in Orange  
County.

<HEADLINE> Tony Gwynn Gets 3,000th Hit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Tony Gwynn got his 3,000th career hit Friday  
night, singling in his first at-bat against the Montreal Expos and 
becoming the 22nd major leaguer to reach that milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn reached down and golfed a soft line drive past second base  
on a 1-2 pitch from Dan Smith, a rookie right-hander making his 
11th career start. 
</P>
<P>
	His Padres teammates raced from the dugout to congratulate him,  
and first base umpire Kerwin Danley gave him a hug. 
</P>
<P>
	Fireworks, usually reserved for Expos' home runs, were set off  
as soon as the hit dropped in, and Gwynn's mother, Vendella, 
celebrating her 64th birthday, came onto to the field and embraced 
her son. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of less than 10,000 at Olympic Stadium stood and gave  
Gwynn a lengthy ovation.

<HEADLINE> Red Hat Inc. To Go Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After a year of extraordinary publicity for the  
upstart computer operating system known as Linux, investors finally 
get to vote on whether the touted program is a Microsoft killer, an 
over-hyped technology, or something in between. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Hat Inc. -- a fast-growing seller of Linux software -- is  
offering its shares to the public as early as next week in one of 
the year's most awaited initial public offerings. The deal, if it 
takes off as some analysts expect, could be the first in a string 
of IPOs from Linux companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet for all the anticipation, investor appetite could be curbed  
by the Herculean task facing the recent flurry of small companies 
focused on Linux: Gaining ground against the seemingly indomitable 
Microsoft Corp. and its ubiquitous Windows program, which runs 90 
percent of the world's desktop computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good test of what the market interest is (in Linux),''  
said analyst Amy Wohl, who owns her own industry consultancy in 
Narberth, Pa. ``Depending on how the IPO turns out, in the next 
month or two you're going to see more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Durham, N.C.-based Red Hat is selling 6 million shares, or  
about 9 percent of the company, to the public. If the stock prices 
at the high range of the company's expectation at about $12 a 
share, Red Hat would raise about $72 million, helping to boost 
spending on its Web site, marketing and other expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Linux (pronounced LINN-nucks), was created in the early 1990s by  
Linus Torvalds, a Finnish student, as an alternative system for 
running a computer's basic functions. Torvalds released his 
blueprints on the Internet so volunteer programmers around the 
world could contribute improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Linux can be downloaded for free off the Web or bought in  
packages with technical support for as little as $30. A growing 
minority of corporate technology workers are embracing Linux as an 
adjunct -- if not an alternative -- to the Unix and Windows NT 
computers at the hub of networks of business machines, and on 
computers that run Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Users praise the system's flexibility and propensity not to  
crash. But it often requires people to memorize and type in 
commands, similar to the DOS software that preceded Windows -- 
daunting to everyday users. And the number of Linux-compatible 
software applications, while growing, pales against the number of 
applications available for Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Linux, while fast gaining adherents, has yet to attain mass  
market success. Last year, sales of Linux comprised an impressive 
17 percent of all ``server'' software, used to run networked 
computers, according to the International Data Corp. research firm. 
But Linux software comprised only 1.8 percent of desktop machines. 
Those figures don't include free downloads off the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue is, Are organizations actually going to use Linux''  
as a major new business computer system, said William Peterson, an 
IDC analyst. ``And is there a market for Linux on the desktop?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Red Hat, by selling prepackaged software and technical support,  
offers an easier alternative to downloading the Linux operating 
system off the Internet, which could take a day or more using a 
conventional dial-up modem. Its distinctive packages -- emblazoned 
with a man donning a rakishly tilted red fedora -- are starting to 
pepper the desks of computer network technicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Hat says it is on the verge of turning a profit and that its  
IPO will enable it to embark on the next stage of its expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale takes place in less-than-ideal market conditions,  
however, with several Internet IPOs recently stumbling. But it also 
may occur the same week as the annual Linux World trade show, which 
starts Monday. Analysts say they wouldn't be surprised if strong 
demand pushed up the initial sale price, partly due to advance buzz 
generated. 
</P>
<P>
	Even at the current price range, the sale would give Red Hat a  
market value of about $800 million -- though its annual revenues 
were just $10.8 million last year -- lifting Red Hat to the sort of 
phenomenal valuation that investors have bestowed upon many newly 
public Internet companies. 
</P>
<P>
	If Red Hat's IPO succeeds, another Linux company, VA Linux  
Systems Inc., which makes business computers pre-loaded with Linux, 
is expected to soon follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Multimillion dollar investments in Red Hat and other Linux  
makers this past year by major technology companies such as chip 
giant Intel Corp. and IBM Corp. are lending credibility to Linux. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent initiatives are pushing it into new arenas as well.  
BuyPogo.Com, a Silicon Valley upstart, is selling $400 Linux 
desktop computers while TiVo, a Sunnyvale, Calif. company, is using 
Linux to run its new digital TV recording device. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, for all its market heft, could be hamstrung in  
counterattacking Linux because the software's license requirement 
flies in the face of Microsoft's strategy to jealously guard its 
software blueprints. Companies that license Linux are required to 
share any changes with others.

<HEADLINE> Nets Give Van Horn 6-Year Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- There was no dawdling in  
negotiations when the New Jersey Nets decided it was time to sign 
forward Keith Van Horn. 
</P>
<P>
	``We actually tried to drag it out to make it last two  
minutes,'' principal owner Lewis Katz said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Horn got an maximum-length, six-year extension, valued at  
roughly $73 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is clearly a linchpin in our hopes for a championship team.  
Hopefully, this year, with everyone healthy, we'll live up to our 
potential,'' Katz said at a news conference to discuss Van Horn's 
six-year contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Horn, 23, who lives in suburban Franklin Lakes with his wife  
and two children, said he was eager to stay with the Nets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I made it a little too obvious, '' he said, adding that  
the rehiring of coach Don Casey played an important role in his 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, announced Sunday, should keep Van Horn, the team's  
leading scorer for the past two seasons, in New Jersey until at 
least 2006. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think, on paper, we have one of the most talented teams in  
the league, but that's just on paper. But now we have to go on the 
court and prove it,'' Van Horn said. 
</P>
<P>
	The team had similar hopes last year, but lost 17 of its first  
20 games, fired coach John Calipari and missed the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets were 13-17 under Casey despite being beset by injuries.  
All-Star Jayson Williams broke his leg, Van Horn broke his thumb 
and shooting guard Kerry Kittles had a bad knee, which has since 
required surgery. The team also lost point guard Sam Cassell and 
centers Jim McIlvaine and Rony Seikaly to injuries for extended 
periods. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassell was traded in a deal that brought Stephon Marbury to New  
Jersey during the season, and Seikaly was put on waivers this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was a disaster,'' Katz said. ``This year we should  
be very competitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 6-foot-10 power forward with the moves of a small forward, Van  
Horn averaged 20.5 points and 7.4 rebounds in his first two 
seasons. He averaged 19.7 points as a rookie and 21.8 last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 10 or 15 years when Keith's time in the NBA may be up, we  
believe people will be talking about the next young kid that comes 
out as the next Keith Van Horn,'' Nets president Michael Rowe said.

<HEADLINE>  Gwynn Loyal to Padres Through It All </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Tony Gwynn is one consistent guy.  
</P>
<P>
	He's played for only one team in his 18-year career, the San  
Diego Padres. He's hit better than .300 for 16 straight seasons and 
is tied for Honus Wagner with eight NL batting titles. 
</P>
<P>
	He got two hits in his major league debut on July 19, 1982.  
</P>
<P>
	Hit No. 1 was a double off Philadelphia's Sid Monge. On the  
field that night was Pete Rose, who would become baseball's career 
hit king. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rose trailed the play and said, `Congratulations. Don't catch  
me in one night,''' Gwynn said. ``That's always going to stick with 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday night at Montreal, Gwynn singled in the first inning  
for his 3,000th career hit. He finished the game 4-for-5, giving 
him 3,003 career hits. 
</P>
<P>
	He was in a rush to get it, too, having said he wanted to beat  
longtime contemporary Wade Boggs to the mark. Boggs had 2,997 hits 
going into Friday night's home game for Tampa Bay against 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn became the 22nd member of the 3,000-hit club, and Boggs is  
bound to become the 23rd. 
</P>
<P>
	But getting to 3,000 wasn't a breeze for Gwynn, 39.  
</P>
<P>
	After a hot April, he strained his left calf breaking out of the  
batter's box on May 21 and ended up making two trips to the 
disabled list, missing 44 games. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed all but two of the Padres' franchise-record 14-game  
winning streak in late June-early July. Gwynn, one of the most 
affable and accessible players in the majors, was frustrated. Not 
as much that his drive for 3,000 hit the skids, but because he was 
missing out on an exciting stretch for the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been very uncomfortable, very difficult,'' Gwynn said  
recently. ``I just want to get there as quickly as possible and get 
back to normal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn uttered those words even before Jim Leyritz took a potshot  
just before he was traded from the Padres to the New York Yankees, 
hinting that Gwynn wasn't exactly a team player. 
</P>
<P>
	The same thing often was said about Boggs, a five-time AL  
batting champion and left-hander hitter like Gwynn. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Gwynn tried to imitate Boggs in his early years.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was the hitter I wanted to be like,'' said Gwynn, who won  
his first batting title the year after Boggs won his first. ``He 
became the hunted. I wanted to emulate him. So for me, there's a 
connection because we're both similar in our approach, except that 
Wade's a whole lot more patient. He was the guy I had to chase.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Gwynn, that approach has been to put the ball in play using  
all fields. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it didn't count in his career totals, Gwynn's favorite  
hit was his homer to right field in the first game of last year's 
World Series at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, Gwynn loves to carve hits the other way. He became so  
proficient at hitting between third base and shortstop that he 
began calling it the ``5.5 Hole'' -- in baseball scoring, the third 
baseman is represented by 5 and the shortstop, 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn even has ``5.5 Hole'' patches on the tongue of his cleats.  
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn played basketball and baseball at San Diego State, and it  
wasn't until his senior season that he decided to stick with 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	He loved basketball and thought he might have a shot at the NBA,  
but didn't start half the games due to an injury suffered the 
previous summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was sitting on the bench and thinking, `I've got to think  
about my career here.' It just dawned on me that I probably had a 
better chance at baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``And about halfway through my senior year I started sneaking  
down to the baseball field and hitting in the cage and taking 
ground balls and stuff. So by the time basketball season ended and 
I went out to play baseball, I was kind of ready, where before I 
would just go straight from basketball to baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was a third-round draft pick of the Padres in June 1981, and  
made his big league debut a little more than a year later. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn won his first batting title in 1984. He won the other  
seven in bunches, from 1987-89, and 1994-97. 
</P>
<P>
	As he got older he seemed to get better, never hitting lower  
than .353 from '93-'97. Last year he fell off to .321, but did hit 
.500 in the World Series as the Padres were swept by the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	His best year was 1994, when he was batting .394 when the  
players' strike began. It was the highest in the majors since Ted 
Williams batted .406 in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the break I was hitting .383 and was really on a good  
roll,'' Gwynn said. ``I was hitting the ball hard and using all 
fields. If I was going to hit .400, I knew that was going to be my 
best crack at it. Unfortunately for me and everyone else, we didn't 
finish the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, that was the year I was doing a whole lot of things  
right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For a guy who's hit .339 for his career -- the best among active  
big leaguers -- a lot of people would say he's done a whole lot of 
things right his entire career.
