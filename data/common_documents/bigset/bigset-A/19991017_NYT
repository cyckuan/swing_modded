PROGRESS DOESN'T LEAD TO PRODUCTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's obvious the New York Yankees are getting to Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic strides they've made since last facing the Red Sox
righthander a month ago were graphically emphasized by the
statistics Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   They had twice as many hits against Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   They struck out five fewer times.
</P>
<P>
   They worked him for a couple of walks.
</P>
<P>
   They got rid of him two innings sooner.
</P>
<P>
   All right, so they scored one fewer run, but let's not nitpick.
</P>
<P>
   What more encouragement could they possibly want _ other than a
hint of victory or a whiff of sustained success?
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that this 13-1 humbling at Fenway Park in Game 3 of
the American League Championship Series _ in which Martinez yielded
two hits and no runs while striking out a Boston postseason-record
12 batters in seven innings _ was a step forward in a most relative
sense. On Sept. 10 at Yankee Stadium, Martinez allowed only a home
run by Chili Davis, walked nobody, and struck out 17 in a 3-1
complete-game victory.
</P>
<P>
   All the victims could do in Saturday's aftermath was compare
degrees of excellence, and that was almost as much an exercise in
futility as trying to hit Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a difference, it was in dominance, the Yankees
seemed to agree. In September, a healthy Martinez had been
overpowering. Saturday, a gimpy Martinez obliged his ailing back by
relying on his curveball, his changeup, and his uncanny cunning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazing,'' said New York left fielder Ricky Ledee, who struck
out twice against Martinez. ``What he did against us in New York
was amazing. It looked today like he was hurting. So to do what he
did against us today was amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   If Ledee seemed stuck for variety in his superlatives, Martinez
encountered no such problem with his repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   ``His velocity wasn't there, but he had command,'' said center
fielder Bernie Williams, a one-strikeout casualty. ``Even when we
went deep in the count and had him 3 and 1 or 3 and 2, he could
still strike us out with the changeup. He did absolutely the best
he could with the stuff he had today.''
</P>
<P>
   Because even though he was missing a key weapon, there was still
plenty in the arsenal. It's just that Saturday the Yankees were
left blinking in bewilderment. In September, they didn't have the
chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pitched us completely different than the time before,''
said shortstop Derek Jeter, who went down once looking, once
swinging after creating false hope with a first-inning single.
``Early on, you could tell he didn't have his fastball. That's what
I got my hit on. But he was hitting his spots. He's the type of
pitcher who doesn't need his fastball because he has three
pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps right fielder Paul O'Neill, another member of the 2-K
club, offered the most logical explanation: Don't try to explain
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best pitcher in baseball,'' said O'Neill. ``What he
has or doesn't have doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to the Yankees, anyway, because they sure don't have it
against Martinez.

FENWAY FAITHFUL GIVE HERO'S WELCOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cacophony coming from the area between Yawkey Way and
Lansdowne Street was a mix of cheers and jeers. Boos reserved for
New York's Roger Clemens, with shouts of support for Boston ace
Pedro Martinez. When Martinez capped his first inning of work with
a strikeout of Bernie Williams, the crowd gave Martinez a standing
ovation that begged Clemens to top the opening act of the home
team's ace. The Red Sox fans would not make it easy for their
former hero.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the first, Fenway Park throbbed with chants of
``Raaah-ger, Raaah-ger.'' Fans targeted Clemens with their
sing-song cry until he produced three outs, and by then the Sox
already had a 2-0 lead on John Valentin's home run. And beneath the
disapproving clamor, individuals with strong rooting interests _
and lungs _ spit out a few choice words.
</P>
<P>
   If you wanted to experience baseball partisanship at its most
extreme, there was no better place to be than Fenway for Saturday's
Game 3 of the American League Championship Series. The pitching
matchup between Clemens and Martinez brought fans to new heights of
name-calling. And the mound showdown took the intense rivalry
between Boston and New York to new levels.
</P>
<P>
   Standing beside the visiting bullpen, David Clifford held a
homemade T-shirt over the right-field wall for Clemens to read. The
shirt read, ``Hey Roger, would you leave your wife if another woman
offered you more?'' The question referred to Clemens leaving the
Sox and signing with Toronto for more money. While Clifford held up
his shirt, others shouted, ``You sold your soul,'' ``Just have
another doughnut, Roger,'' and ``That's right, you fat Texan.''
</P>
<P>
   The few Clemens fans seated around the bullpen were vocal,
though they could not make as much noise as their Boston
counterparts. Anthony Manzo of Providence practically yelled
himself hoarse, trying to root for Roger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to make sure I yell a little louder to protect him a
little bit,'' Manzo said before shouting words of encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Manzo's support, Clemens would last only two innings
plus, yielding five runs, as he took the loss in a 13-1 Boston
rout.
</P>
<P>
   The hostilities started even before the game. Yankees outfielder
Darryl Strawberry was harassed during batting practice with
references to his troubled past. Those in the outfield cheered when
Clemens overthrew catcher Jorge Posada with a practice toss. Boston
fans would comment to people taking seats next to them, ``You
better be a Red Sox fan.'' When Yankees fans braved Red Sox
enclaves, hecklers were waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Schumacher of Garden City, N.Y., wore a hat made especially
for the occasion that read simply, ``1918.'' He expected a lot of
heckling, but said the only statement he needed to make was the one
written above the brim.
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher found a seat in front of die-hard Red Sox fan Pete
Wilson of Waltham. It was a seating arrangement that tempted both
sides to put their best barbs forward. Wilson and friend James Wood
of Scituate felt the Yankees fans in front of them were asking for
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   After New York shortstop Derek Jeter got a single in the first,
the teasing from the visiting fans started.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just wait till your fat boy Clemens gets out there,'' said
Wilson, whose words were prophetic. ``That's why we gave him to
you. Watch when he gets shelled today. After (Game 3), they'll hate
Clemens in Boston, they'll hate him in Toronto, and they'll hate
him in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Out in the bleachers, fans from both sides expressed their
opinions with signs and body paint. On a back wall, Pedro and
Rocket name tags were posted for each pitcher's strikeout count.
Red K's were designated for Martinez, with blue K's for Clemens.
Yankees fan Andre Larocque of Salisbury, Vt., brought 16 K's for
each player, but was hoping he would have plenty to borrow from the
Martinez stash to place under the Yankee starter's nickname. As it
turned out, he needed only two blue K's. Twelve red K's were
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Another sign in the bleachers read, ``Pedro's fallen Yankees.''
Underneath the title were action shots of each Yankee batter. Steve
Colby and Jordon Pranski planned to cut out the face of each batter
Martinez struck out. Other fans wore bumper stickers and pins
proclaiming, ``Reverse the Curse'' and ``Cy Young vs. Cy Old.''
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the seventh, as the Sox' run count rose into
double figures, the Fenway faithful had a burning question. ``Where
is Roger?'' they chanted, knowing full well Clemens's day long had
been over.

DAUBACH HANGING IN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The answer to The Daubach Riddle, as with all good mysteries,
will not be known until the final page is turned.
</P>
<P>
   As the spotlight shining on these 1999 Red Sox grows brighter
and brighter on the team now playing for the American League
pennant, more and more baseball fans from around the country are
asking the question that has been asked in Boston every day Jimy
Williams posts his lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Why is Brian Daubach playing?
</P>
<P>
   Even Daubach acknowledges there have been times _ particularly
during his lost six weeks from mid-August until the end of the
regular season _ when he showed up at the ballpark and peeked at
the lineup with trepidation. More often than not, though, his name
would be on it.
</P>
<P>
   Just the other night, the rookie arrived at Jacobs Field in
Cleveland with serious doubts as to whether he'd be starting in the
fifth and deciding Division Series game against the Indians. ``The
night before, we scored 23 runs and I didn't get a hit,'' he said.
``And I'd had only one hit in the series. So I didn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds and hundreds of managers through baseball's history
might have sat the slumping Daubach that night, but Jimy Williams
did not. And Daubach made his manager's faith pay off right away,
with two hits in the first three innings of that madcap game, which
the Red Sox eventually won, 12-8.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how much that meant to me, for Jimy to have
me in the lineup,'' said Daubach. ``I can't tell you how much I owe
to Jimy for sticking with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams moved the rookie down in the order (from third to
seventh) in Saturday's Game 3 against the Yankees, and the move
paid immediate dividends when Daubach hit a two-run homer off
Hideki Irabu in the third inning to up the Sox' lead to 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happened those three or four weeks,'' he
said of his mid-August slump. ``I might have been slumping a little
bit at first, but after that it really got to me mentally. I tried
to change so many things, and when you try to change too many
things, it gets to you. Then it really got to be mental with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus was born The Daubach Riddle.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 16, the first baseman-designated hitter was the American
League's hottest hitter, and that night against Oakland at Fenway
Park, with the Red Sox trailing, 5-3, the 27-year-old had one of
the most courageous at-bats in recent Boston memory. On a 3-2 count
with the bases loaded and two out in the ninth, Daubach drove a
pitch over the right-field foul pole for what appeared to be the
winning grand slam. It was called foul. But on the next pitch, the
ninth of his at-bat, Daubach drove the ball off the The Wall,
clearing the bases to give the Red Sox a 6-5 win, their most
dramatic comeback of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But as if by magic, Daubach's swing suddenly disappeared. As if
he were being punished by the baseball gods for his dramatic
heroics, Daubach could hit nothing over the next week and the weeks
after that. ``It was just a little slump at first,'' said Daubach.
But it grew and grew until it seemed a foul ball into the stands
constituted a quality at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't as tough as it might have been, because we were
winning,'' said Daubach. ``If we weren't winning, it would have
been much, much tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, following the Aug. 16 dramatics, Daubach was hitting
.339 and the Red Sox were two games ahead of Oakland in a tight
race for the AL wild card. When the season ended Oct. 3, Daubach
was down to .294 _ but the Red Sox had run away with the wild card.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach believes that his swing started to return in the
Cleveland series. ``This series is the same way,'' he said. ``I
started off a little bit slow, but I feel the same way: that my
swing is back.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes there's a fine line between slumping and success. In
Thursday's Game 2 at Yankee Stadium, Daubach hit two balls to left
field that ``were hit good but just didn't fall in,'' he said. ``I
don't know, in Fenway one might have been off The Wall and one
might have been a home run.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, The Daubach Riddle has yet to be solved. When the
final game has been played and the final page turns, it may be
clearer whether Williams's loyalty to Brian Daubach has been a
winning strategy.

   He wasn't trying to take Rawjuh out of the yahd. ``With a man on
third, I was just trying to hit a fly ball,'' shrugged John
Valentin, after the Rocket's red glare had faded over the Fens
Saturday night. ``I took a good swing _ and I hit a home run.''
</P>
<P>
   So it goes, so it has gone for the Red Sox third baseman ever
since the leaves began to turn. He beats Cleveland in Game 3 of the
Division Series to stop the flow of carmine blood. He knocks in
seven runs in Game 4, helps hang up ridiculous numbers on the
scoreboard and leaves the Indians shellshocked.
</P>
<P>
   And Saturday night, with Boston down two games to the Yankees
and hoping just to survive the weekend, Valentin jump-started his
mates with a two-run blow into the left-center-field screen mere
minutes into the first inning that knocked Roger Clemens back on
his heels and began one of the worst autumn days in New York
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has some impressive numbers in eight games in these
playoffs,'' said manager Jimy Williams, after Valentin had gone 3
for 6 and knocked in five runs to bring his postseason tally to
four home runs and 17 RBIs. ``And certainly, when you're down two
games and you can get a couple of runs up, that helps us a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't so much the two runs that helped as much as their
stunning immediacy. All summer long, the Fenway faithful had
fantasized about the Sox socking it to Rawjuh in the ALCS. By the
time Clemens took the hill, the ballpark was spilling over with
pent-up emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Offerman's leadoff triple, which right fielder Paul O'Neill
lost in the sun, doubled the decibel level. Up stepped Valentin,
hoping just to loft something deep enough to allow Offerman to tag.
``Being down 0-2, we knew we needed to get some runs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens ran the count to 2-2, then dealt Valentin a cross-seam
fastball away. ``But it ran like a two-seamer and it was up, too,''
Clemens said. ``He put it in the net.''
</P>
<P>
   And just like that, it was Christmas in October from Hartford to
Presque Isle, Maine _ and Clemens soon went pffft. ``You definitely
don't want to have a start like that,'' he said. ``At two runs,
you're fighting and clawing right then. Because we knew Pedro would
be tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentin wasn't done. His grounder to short scored Trot Nixon
with a third Red Sox run in the second inning. His single in the
fifth sent Darren Lewis home with the eighth run. And his single
off the wall in the seventh scored Nixon with the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   All of those, though, were merely bonus skyrockets to punctuate
Valentin's extraordinary autumnal fireworks show. A month ago he
was on the disabled list with patella tendinitis, wondering if his
season was finished. It was, actually, an unintended blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got some rest and found out what was wrong with my knee,''
said Valentin, who'll have surgery whenever this extended
summer-stock drama ends. ``I got physical therapy and started to
feel better. When the DL was up, I told Jimy that I wanted to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   He ended the season with a five-game hitting streak, and a week
ago Saturday his bat turned to gold. John Valentin has become Yaz
in 1967, Fisk in 1975, Hendu in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a dream? ``Not really,'' Valentin says.
</P>
<P>
   Not yet.

OFFERMAN EARNING STRIPES AS A YANKEE KILLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He set the tone in the first inning Saturday by ripping a fly
ball to right field that Paul O'Neill lost in the sun for a leadoff
triple.
</P>
<P>
   With one swing of his bat, Jose Offerman had taken some of the
luster off Roger Clemens's postseason return to Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Offerman kept it up in the second when he lined a single to left
that kept a rally alive. Not that anyone should be surprised by
what Offerman did in the Red Sox' 13-1 victory over the Yankees in
Game 3 of the American League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   Offerman banged out 12 hits in 37 at-bats (.324) against Yankee
pitching during the regular season. Although most of the Red Sox'
bats cooled during the first two games of the ALCS in New York,
Offerman banged out five hits in his first 10 at-bats. He went 3
for 6 Saturday to keep his average at .500 for the series.
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday's game, Offerman is a sizzling 15 for 34 (.441)
in eight postseason games.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Offerman came to the Red Sox, he did well against
Yankee pitching, posting a career .300 average since he came to
Kansas City in 1996 in a trade from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret,'' said Offerman when asked about his success
against the Yankees. ``I don't call it luck or whatever. You never
feel comfortable when you face the staff the Yankees have. Maybe
it's good luck for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Offerman said the games' importance hasn't changed his approach
at the plate. ``You try and give a good performance,'' he said.
``You don't try and do anything different.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, he was delighted to start the game with a bang.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great when you get to score in the beginning,'' said
Offerman, who ripped Clemens's second pitch of the game into the
right-field corner.
</P>
<P>
   Offerman has done his best to silence critics who questioned the
Red Sox' sanity when he signed a four-year, $26 million deal as a
free agent.
</P>
<P>
   But from the start, Offerman proved he was worth the money,
worth the confidence Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette showed
when he signed him. It showed in his first game in a Red Sox
uniform, when he went 4 for 5 in an 5-3 over Kansas City on Opening
Day.
</P>
<P>
   He has shown it with his hitting, which was never really in
question, with a solid .294 season.
</P>
<P>
   But he also has made the defensive plays at second base, turning
what was supposed to be a weakness into a strength. Saturday he
made a leaping backhanded stab of a Bernie Williams line drive in
the top of the seventh.

CLEMENS LEFT TO FACE CURSE OF OLD AGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He is finished and doesn't know it yet. If someone decided to
remake ``Ghost'' with a sports angle, he could be the star. His
problem is that he looks in the mirror and still sees ``Roger
Clemens, The Rocket.'' Clemens and his mirror do each other a
disservice because ``The Rocket'' is a pitching artifact. A more
accurate reflection would be of a 37-year-old Clemens, ``Decent
Pitcher Who Used To Be Great.''
</P>
<P>
   If you don't believe that, all you have to do is listen to the
prayers of the New York Yankees this morning. They are praying that
their American League Championship Series with the Red Sox doesn't
go seven games. If it does, Clemens will face Pedro Martinez again.
The only way that would be a fair matchup is if you took a
computer-generated Clemens from 1986 and matched him with Martinez,
today's best pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens-Martinez Saturday at Fenway Park was hyped as a
heavyweight fight. The boxing analogy was perfect because just like
in boxing, the expected gem never materialized. It was a rout.
Clemens was in a position to give the Yankees a 3-0 series lead.
Instead, he lasted two-plus innings and gave up five runs. Jose
Offerman opened the game with a triple to right field. The next
batter, former teammate John Valentin, homered to left.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Clemens was done and most of the 33,190 fans in
the park knew it. Clemens told Yankees manager Joe Torre that he
had no problem pitching at Fenway. It was not the truth. He said he
has pitched in hostile places, such as Texas, so pitching here
would not be any different. It was not the truth. He said the crowd
chanting his name and a derisive ``Where Is Roger?'' did not bother
him. It did.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees eventually lost, 13-1. Clemens was so bad that he
couldn't even complete his mess; he handed the ball to Torre after
throwing a strike to Brian Daubach. None of this means the Yankees
will lose the next three games to the Sox and go home for the
winter. What it does mean is that Clemens is New York's problem
now.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees pitcher David Cone said he talked with Clemens and that
he was upset, ``but it wasn't like he was on a suicide watch.''
Cone also said that he told Clemens not to be upset because ``he
still has a chance to get the last laugh. He seemed to like that
one.''
</P>
<P>
   I like Cone. He is a smart man. But he knows better. If the Sox
and Yankees take this series to seven games and Clemens pitches the
last game, the Sox are going to the World Series. Clemens has
always been a fine regular-season pitcher. He hasn't been a
postseason bust because, as Yankees catcher Joe Girardi said, ``His
ERA in the playoffs is in the 3's. That's excellent for the
American League.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is not at a Martinez level. That's another reason
watching Clemens was like being in the Fenway wing of the Museum of
Fine Arts. He represents the old Sox, the Sox who were stars in the
regular season and OK in the playoffs. These Sox may not be the
most gifted players in the game, but you know where to find their
best players when games need to be won. What makes Martinez great
is that he shows up when you expect him to. What makes Nomar
Garciaparra great is that he plays hurt and drives in runs when his
team needs him. Clemens has never done things like that. And he
never will.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Clemens, dressed in a blue shirt that read
``Disney, Wide World of Sports,'' gave an equally interesting and
bizarre recap of his short afternoon in the Fens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I was making some good pitches,'' he said. ``They got
some good hits off some good pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after saying that, he began to operate the language as
only he can. ``Those guys are tough,'' he said of the Sox. ``I
think I know a couple guys in the opposing dugout too well. I think
a couple of them are too comfortable, to be honest with you,
against me. I have to make some changes there.''
</P>
<P>
   He seemed to be saying he is going to start brushing some guys
back. He was asked to clarify.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think I need to expand,'' he said. ``I just think some
guys are too comfortable and it is not a great feeling to have. I
just think some guys get too comfortable up there and you like to
expand and it is something I need to do more of.''
</P>
<P>
   He is finished and he doesn't know it. The Sox are comfortable
because Clemens does not scare them. That won't change if he
screams, brushes them back, or expands. Even the most loyal Yankee
fan roots for the uniform rather than the man when Clemens pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Some people tried to float theories of Clemens experiencing back
tightness and grimacing in the dugout to explain his wildness.
Torre was asked about that. ``I think the score was making him
grimace,'' the manager said. He also said of Clemens, ``I just
didn't think the stuff was there. That's as simplistic as it can
be.''
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner, who was not feeling well, was seen and
heard in the Yankee clubhouse Saturday night. He said that games
like this cannot happen often. But if the Yankees go to seven games
in this series and lose, it will be The Boss's fault. He had a
big-game pitcher in David Wells and traded him away. He acquired a
great regular-season winner who has never dominated in big games.
For at least one season, that is the Yankees' own curse.

THANK TORRE FOR CONFRONTATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Um, er, Yankees, I'm not sure how to tell you this, but, ah, we,
you people just were embarrassed by a hospital case.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first inning I had exactly what I had the whole game,''
explained Pedro Martinez. ``Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Come again?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing. All I could do was spot. I had no fastball, no curve,
and no changeup.''
</P>
<P>
   All that nothing produced a seven-inning, two-hit, 12-strikeout
line in his team's 13-1 destruction of the defending world
champions.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we should try again. Maybe instead of ``nothing'' Pedro
meant to say ``something,'' or ``a little,'' or ``not as much as
usual,'' or ``maybe not as much as I had when I struck out 17 of
these chumps last month, but enough to get by.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing,'' he insisted. ``I'm telling you how I felt. I doubt
if I threw any fastball better than 88 (miles per hour). I'm
hurting. Every pitch. I got by because I could spot the ball, I had
a whole bunch of grinders out there behind me, and because of
God.''
</P>
<P>
   Now some may argue that when it comes to this business of
pitching baseballs, Pedro is God. Joe Torre is certainly impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably didn't have the fastball he had the other night in
Cleveland,'' analyzed the Yankee skipper. ``But his selection was
probably the same. He can reach into his bag for any one of three
pitches and throw them for strikes, which is why he is so hard to
hit. And he seems to sense what he needs to throw at any given
time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He may be hurting, but he still knows how to pitch,'' saluted
Nomar Garciaparra, one of those ``grinders'' Pedro was alluding to.
``He thinks out there. He knows what he's doing every pitch, every
hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   So how exactly did Mr. ``I Got Plenty Of Nuthin'' manage to
stifle the Yankees? How did he get Derek Jeter on strikes twice,
Paul O'Neill on strikes twice, Tino Martinez on strikes twice, and
Chili Davis on strikes twice, and never mind getting Ricky Ledee on
strikes twice since he is just a lad?
</P>
<P>
   ``I mixed my pitches,'' explained the World's Greatest Pitcher.
``When they were looking for a change, I'd throw a little cutter.
When they were looking for a breaking ball, I threw a sinker.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh.
</P>
<P>
   If we can take Pedro at his word _ and can anyone think of a
reason why we shouldn't? _ this was the greatest case of making
Something out of Nothing we've ever seen in a Red Sox uniform. The
previous standard bearer was Luis Tiant's performance in Game 4 of
the 1975 World Series, when he and his sweat-laden Fu Manchu needed
162 pitches, his brain, and an iron will to hold off the Big Red
Machine. But Looie still gave up hits and runs that night. The
final score was 5-4. Pedro gave up a one-out Jeter single in the
first and a two-out Tino single in the fourth. He also walked two.
No one went anywhere, except back to the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   What Pedro Martinez definitely laid out to his postgame
inquisitors, and therefore what all folks interested in the welfare
of the Boston Red Sox must accept, is that this new, impaired Pedro
is the only Pedro we're going to see in however many days and games
remain in the season. He is hurting, and he is not going to get any
better. There will be no more 97 mile per hour heaters, no more
falling-off-the-cliff curves, and no more what David Cone calls his
``parachute changeups.'' What the Yankees saw Saturday is what they
could expect to see in any Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts, and it hurts every pitch I make,'' he shrugged.
``It's not going to get any better from one day or the other. I
have a strained muscle in the back, and there isn't time to heal
it.''
</P>
<P>
   He is neither whining nor soliciting sympathy. He is an honest
man giving honest answers to straight questions. In his previous
state, he was a pitcher for the ages. In this current state, he is
a craftsman relying on his wisdom and guile.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is an artist out there,'' declared Torre. ``It's just that
he uses a baseball instead of a paintbrush. There is no question
that he carves up that plate pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so he can't throw 97, or even 90. (``I bet I can't throw any
harder now than 89,'' Pedro said.) That's OK, according to manager
Jimy Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Location, change of speeds, movement, and then velocity make
for a good pitcher,'' Williams pointed out. ``He used different
pitches starting out hitters, and maybe then to finish.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a story that just keeps getting better and better. He is
having a better year than even Roger Clemens had in 1986, and we
might have to go back to Smoky Joe Wood in 1912 (34-5) to find a
better Red Sox pitcher. If this was the last time we see him in
'99, it was a suitable farewell.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't automatically assume the series has to go seven in
order to see him again. ``I'm gonna keep doing it again and
again,'' he vowed. ``If the team needs me tomorrow night to get one
out, I will do it. That's what I'm here for.''
</P>
<P>
   So that's what he's here for. The Yankees thought he was here
for one reason _ to make them look ridiculous.

KO FOR MARTINEZ AND RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This was worse than the twilight of the gods derisively
predicted by general manager Dan Duquette three years ago when the
Red Sox let Roger Clemens take the money and run.
</P>
<P>
   This was heart-of-darkness, bottomless-pit stuff in which
Clemens and the New York Yankees descended Saturday afternoon in
Fenway Park, where Pedro Martinez burned as brightly as ever and
Sox hitters remained as white-hot as they were last weekend against
the Cleveland Indians, no one more so than Boston's new (first?)
Mr. October, John Valentin.
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, any fears of a New York sweep in the American
League Championship Series evaporated as the Red Sox inflicted a
13-1 loss on the Yankees, the worst ever in the Bombers' long
history of storied autumns.
</P>
<P>
   The shock value of the defeat, in which Clemens gave up six runs
and was pulled two batters into the third inning, elicited this
warning from Yankees owner George Steinbrenner to his team in the
clubhouse, according to someone who was there: ``This can happen
once, but it can't happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   The win sliced New York's lead to 2-1 in the best-of-seven
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost two games there but we still felt confident,'' said
Bret Saberhagen, who will take the mound Sunday night against
Yankees lefthander Andy Pettitte. ``We don't feel like baseball is
going to end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just feel like it's destiny, or what, but we think we can
beat everybody we're playing. Things just don't seem to bother us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't felt a whole lot of pressure. We just come out to
play. If it's meant for us to win, we'll win. If not, we don't.'
</P>
<P>
   With 12 whiffs in seven innings, Martinez, even without his best
fastball, set a record for most strikeouts by a Sox pitcher in the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am just out there with God in front of me and my
teammates,'' Martinez said. ``I mean, I am not hiding anything. I
am hurting in every pitch I throw but I manage to do it somehow and
I am not going to quit doing it until I know I am not getting
anybody out.''
</P>
<P>
   Tack on the 17 whiffs Martinez had in New York Sept. 10, and he
has 29 strikeouts in his last 16 innings against the Yankees, who
can only dread a Game 7 reprise against the Sox ace.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a righthanded Warren Spahn today,'' said Sox pitching
coach Joe Kerrigan, invoking the name of the Hall of Famer who 51
years ago was a master of changing speeds as he pitched the Boston
Braves into the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just don't appreciate the command he has of the
baseball, the way he can manipulate the ball. He doesn't just throw
it to spots, he manipulates it. He sinks it, rises it, cuts it.
He's a magician with the ball, what can you say?''
</P>
<P>
   Valentin, meanwhile, drove in five runs with a first-inning,
two-run home run off Clemens, an infield out, and two singles,
giving him 17 RBIs in eight postseason games. The Sox rolled up 21
hits, 10 for extra bases, in a stunning encore to their record
23-run, 24-hit outburst against the Indians last Sunday night, the
last time they were on Yawkey Way. The 21 hits set an ALCS record,
and the Sox have now scored 44 runs in their last 16 innings at
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like Cleveland,'' chanted a sellout crowd of 33,190,
which brought its ``A'' game every bit as much as the Sox, who also
benefited from a home run and three singles by Nomar Garciaparra,
two doubles and a single by Trot Nixon, and a home run and double
by the Belleville Basher, Brian Daubach.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, meanwhile, saw their record-tying 12-game
postseason winning streak come to a crashing end in a loss that
eclipsed their previous worst beating, a 12-1 thrashing by Atlanta
in Game 1 of the 1996 World Series. The Sox had lost 10 in a row in
the ALCS since Game 7 of the '86 ALCS against Anaheim, in which
Clemens was the winning pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Momentum-turner?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, there is no question,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said.
``I believe that in a short series a game turns it momentum-wise,
but what we need to do is come out here and pitch the way we are
capable of pitching and that normally quiets things down. That is
what we rely on.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for sure, the Red Sox feel good about themselves tonight
and we are just the opposite. But that is what makes these short
series great. It just tests your insides, basically.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, whose value to the Yankees was supposed to be measured
by his capacity to deliver in October, was driven from the premises
as the Red Sox routed the Rocket and successor Hideki Irabu in an
unprecedented display of Bomber-bashing. Clemens was long gone by
the seventh inning, when the crowd chanted ``Where is Roger?'' and
answered with, ``In the shower.''
</P>
<P>
   While Martinez held up his end of the most anticipated pitching
matchup ever on Yawkey Way, striking out at least one Yankee in
each of his seven innings and allowing just two hits, Clemens had
no answer for the sarcastic singsong ``Ro-ger, Ro-ger'' that swept
the greensward under cloudless blue skies and summer-like
temperatures (73 at game time).
</P>
<P>
   Two pitches into the Sox first, Jose Offerman was aboard third
on a triple lashed off the 3-foot retaining wall in the right-field
corner. Five pitches later, the Sox led, 2-0, as Valentin launched
a 2-and-2 pitch from Clemens into the left-field net. Doubles by
Nixon and Garciaparra, sandwiched around a single by Offerman, made
it 4-0 in the second, and Torre lifted Clemens for Irabu after a
single by Stanley and a first-pitch strike to Daubach, whose home
run off Irabu made it 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in a tough spot tonight,'' Yankees pitcher David Cone
said of Clemens and the hostile reception he received. ``You
certainly feel for him. He never had a chance to settle down.''
</P>
<P>
   The six runs eclipsed the number of runs allowed by the Yankees
in their five previous games combined. Daubach's home run left
Irabu in the role of sacrificial pitcher, as he was left in to give
up eight runs (seven earned) and 13 hits in 4 2/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just went out there and swung the bats,'' Garciaparra said.
``Everybody went out there and did it and that was just the
difference right there. It wasn't a matter of who we are facing or
how his stuff is going today or from other times. It was a question
of, we've got to get it done.''

SABERHAGEN VIES WITH PETTITTE FOR CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT AND BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are both playoff veterans, only they earned their
reputations in different decades. Control is their calling card,
overcompetitiveness their downfall. But the difference between
Sunday night's Game 4 starters is that the Yankees' Andy Pettitte
has already recovered from his worst stretch of the season; Bret
Saberhagen is hoping to do the same for the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   After further review, Saberhagen has had the destructive quirks
of his last two outings scrutinized, analyzed, and documented.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at the tapes and tried to iron out a couple of
things,'' said the veteran righthander, who was knocked around
liberally in his two starts against the Indians in the Division
Series. ``First, you've got to identify them, and then it becomes a
matter of making adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   A perfect 3-0 in September, Saberhagen was seen as a critical
piece of the pitching rotation when the Sox opened the playoffs. By
the end of the Cleveland series, he appeared to be in critical
condition.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 2, Saberhagen gave up six runs in 2 2/3 innings,
allowing five hits and an uncharacteristic three walks. After
giving up a career-low 11 walks all season, the veteran suddenly
had trouble finding the plate, and at times looked uncomfortable on
the mound. Saberhagen walked the leadoff hitter in the third
inning, ending a streak of 111 innings in which he had not issued a
free pass to the leadoff hitter.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 5, he exited in the second inning after Wil Cordero
opened with a single and Travis Fryman followed with a home run.
The inning before, Saberhagen had given up a 477-foot blast to Jim
Thome. A craftsman since he broke into the majors in 1984, suddenly
he was getting blasted, heaving one fat pitch after another up to
the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was rushing too much, being a little too quick with
my delivery, and that hurt me,'' said Saberhagen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shoulder felt the best it's felt all year, and maybe my
velocity was too good. I've got to try to slow it down a little out
there and hit spots. That's how I'll be effective out there.''
</P>
<P>
   You want effective? How about the progression of Pettitte, who
went from trade bait to top rate in the span of a month.
</P>
<P>
   He lugged a burdensome 5-7 record and 5.59 ERA into the All-Star
break, and there was widespread speculation that when the schedule
resumed for the Yankees, Pettitte wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Pettitte he had two rather influential lobbyists
_ manager Joe Torre and pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre. And
miraculously, Yankees owner George Steinbrenner elected to follow a
policy based on something other than personal whim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was just Mel Stottlemyre and myself basically could
not shake the memory of how well he has pitched in the postseason
and in very important games,'' said Torre. ``Every time I was asked
for my opinion, we were strong in favor of keeping Andy. That
didn't mean we were going to keep him, but it got to a point where
George Steinbrenner said, `Well, it is going to be your decision.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, there was another season's reprieve for Andy Pettitte, New
York Yankee. He showed his gratitude by ringing up a 9-4 record and
3.84 ERA after the break. To reinforce Torre's argument, the
lefthander shackled Texas in Game 2 of the Division Series,
allowing seven hits and one run in 7 1/3 innings of a 3-1 victory
at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made the decision,'' said Torre of his lefthander, ``and
I'm glad we did.''

GARCIAPARRA STAYS UP TO SPEED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He had four hits, scored twice, drove home three teammates, and
added a home run and double to his already impressive postseason
resume.
</P>
<P>
   He also found time to leap high and snag a Scott Brosius liner
in the fifth, carbon-copying his scintillating plays in Yankee
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   For 3 hours 14 minutes Saturday afternoon at Fenway Park, Red
Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra provided the heart that
complemented Pedro Martinez's soul in a dominating 13-1 victory
over the Yankees in Game 3 of the American League Championship
Series in which both players played in pain.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra's sore right wrist, courtesy of Oriole Alberto
Reyes's inside pitch as the regular season wound down, was painful
enough to keep him out of Game 3 of the Division Series a week ago
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in addition to his usual ritual of adjusting his wristbands
between pitches, Garciaparra, between half-innings, changes the
protective bandage on his wrist, one for batting, one for fielding.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why he's a little bit later than the rest of those guys
going out on the field because he has to have a different tape
job,'' explained manager Jimy Williams after Saturday's 13-1
blowout of the Yankees in which Garciaparra added postseason home
run No. 4, his second against the Yankees. ``He just loves to play.
I think you all know that. He's a fine, fine player.''
</P>
<P>
   One who has played through the pain to the tune of 12 hits in 25
postseason at-bats (.480) with 3 doubles, 4 homers, and 9 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody is 100 percent at this stage of the
game,'' Garciaparra said when asked about his ability to bounce
back. ``You still have to go out there and play. As long as I'm
healthy enough, I'm going to keep on going out there.''
</P>
<P>
   He reached base five times Saturday, with the first trip a gift
from Yankee second baseman Chuck Knoblauch, who threw wildly past
first on Garciaparra's grounder.
</P>
<P>
   But there was nothing tainted about his next four trips _ a line
drive RBI double, a clean single to left, a base hit to right, and
a lofty drive over the Green Monster for a two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra said he didn't feel any particular joy in watching
Roger Clemens take Saturday's loss. He was more concerned about his
team taking the win and perhaps changing the momentum of the
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a matter of who was out there on the mound,'' said
Garciaparra. ``It was a matter of what we had to go out there and
do. That was the key. We just came out, swung the bats, and did
it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was clear that Game 4 of the ALCS was on Garciaparra's mind
before he even hit the Game 3 postgame shower.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game's over with. The score was irrelevant,'' said
Garciaparra. ``We have another game tomorrow. It's all about
winning. We want to keep playing. We're still down.''
</P>
<P>
   But hardly out, thanks in large measure to the gutsy everyday
leader of the Boston Red Sox.

ROCKET FIZZLES IN PLAYOFFS AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pedro's native tongue is Spanish, but the Rocket was the one
pleading, ``No mas.'' Does this make up for eight decades of
heartache? No, but it feels pretty damn good.
</P>
<P>
   Next time those annoying Yankee fans hit you with Bucky
(Bleeping) Dent, Mike Torrez, Harry Frazee, Jacob Ruppert, or
George Herman Ruth, drop a Roger Clemens on 'em.
</P>
<P>
   Folks will try to put a Curse Reverse spin on what happened at
Fenway Saturday and maybe that's not a bad idea. After taking it on
the chin from the New Yorkers for three generations, the Red Sox
rode the strong arm of Pedro Martinez and routed turncoat Clemens
and the Yankees, 13-1, in one of the most raucous, robust days in
the 88-year history of Old Fenway. It was the worst loss in the
long, proud history of Yankees postseason baseball.
</P>
<P>
   It was Cy Young vs. Cy Old (bumper stickers said so). It was the
man we once thought was the greatest Red Sox pitcher of them all .
. . against the man we now think is the greatest Red Sox pitcher of
them all. Roger and Pedro were going to put dueling doughnuts on
the board for eight or nine innings and maybe settle it by standing
behind home plate and seeing which one could throw a ball over the
Green Monster.
</P>
<P>
   But no. The fight of the century turned into Sonny Liston-Floyd
Patterson, at Comiskey Park, 1962. It was over before the afternoon
sun dropped over Mission Hill. It turned out to be Cy Sterling vs.
Sy Sperling.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro (seven innings, two hits, 12 strikeouts) performed as
expected. Not blessed with his best stuff on this day, he was the
lionhearted godson of Luis Tiant, spinning a beauty as Sox Nation
chanted his name.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, on the other hand, titillated his legion of detractors
with a sorry, two-plus innings that would have embarrassed Reggie
Cleveland or John Wasdin. Living down to his suspect postseason
past, the Rocket gave up five runs, six hits, and two walks before
he was mercifully lifted with no outs in the third. He is a
first-ballot Hall of Famer, but badly needs another chance to
redeem his playoff reputation. It must scare Yankee fans to think
of a potential seventh game featuring Pedro-Rocket Redux.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the man who pitched well said he had nothing. And the man
who was routed gave a clinic in denial.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro: ``I'm hurting and I'm not lying. I don't feel like I have
my fastball like I should. I strained my back muscle. I haven't had
time to get rest. I'm hurting every pitch I throw. The first
inning, I had exactly what I had the whole game. Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger: ``I felt great. Everything went pretty well in the
bullpen and I took it to the mound with me, too. From the second
inning on, I felt good. They got some hits off some good pitches.
Give those guys credit. They fought.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Sox leading, 10-0, in the seventh, Sox fans chanted
``Where is Roger?''
</P>
<P>
   Turns out he must have been visiting a hypnotist _ the only
person who could convince him that nothing dreadful had happened.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens was not alone in Yankee misery. Paul O'Neill lost a
flyball in the sun and Chuck Knoblauch committed one of three
Yankee errors when he made a patented Steve Sax toss toward first
on a Nomar Garciaparra grounder. Meanwhile, the Yanks had no answer
for John ``Mr. October'' Valentin (five more RBIs) or the former
shoe salesman from Belleville, Ill., Brian Daubach (home run and
double). Boston cracked 21 hits (``I think a couple of 'em are too
comfortable against me, to be honest,'' warned Clemens).
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have got to win two of the next three now. They
cannot possibly want the Rocket vs. the Pocket Rocket in a seventh
and deciding game. Clemens through the years has been cut some
slack regarding his postseason performance (two wins in 11 starts),
but his Saturday flop at Fenway raises serious doubt about chances
in any Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thrown the ball well in postseason play,'' he said. ``I
wouldn't consider tonight one of those. I knew what I was up
against. Obviously, I would love to make a better showing. I hope I
don't have to pitch again, but if I do, I'll be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, what is left to say about the Dominican King? Unlike
Clemens in '86 (24-4), Pedro in '99 seems to be getting better in
October. He was shutting out the Indians in the Division Series
when he hurt his back in Game 1, came back to win Game 5 with six
innings of hitless relief, and Saturday struck out more batters
than any Sox pitcher in postseason history (which includes Babe
Ruth).
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees will never forget Pedro's 17-strikeout, one-hitter
in the Bronx last month, possibly the best game ever pitched
against the Pinstripes. New York has zero runs, three hits, and 29
strikeouts in its last 16 innings against Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   When it got to 13-0, the chant was, ``Just Like Cleveland.''
Then came ``Hey, hey, hey . . . goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They can associate with these players,'' Sox manager Jimy
Williams said of the Sox fans. ``That's what I think. The people in
the community, they're in these uniforms, so to speak, even though
they're not playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely incredible. The Red Sox humiliated and embarrassed
the world champion New York Yankees. But try to remember that this
was only one game in a seven-game series. The New Yorkers still
lead, two games to one. It's not a good idea to gloat too much over
one game. After all, Pedro can't pitch every day. And unfortunately
for Boston, neither can Roger.
</P>
<P>
   Did Boston fans unleash too much venom and ridicule on the heads
of the Yanks? Perhaps. But after eight decades of Yankee-inflicted
pain, and seeing New York win 24 world championships since Boston's
last title, citizens of Red Sox Nation could not contain
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Hard to blame 'em.

Braves get an Olerud awakening
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NEW YORK _ The laws of probability were destined to put an end to
this at some point.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, one of the New York Mets' big guns would start
firing. Likewise, the Atlanta Braves couldn't keep winning with a
popgun offensive attack. And what were the odds of John Rocker
continuing to shoot holes through conventional wisdom, especially
in a hostile environment?
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly inevitable was prolonged for another day _ maybe
three or four _ as the Mets rallied for a 3-2 victory over the
Braves on Saturday night at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, who had won six consecutive playoff games, hold a
3-1 lead in the best-of-seven series, which continues today.
</P>
<P>
   John Olerud's two-out chopper off Ozzie Guillen's glove in the
eighth inning drove home two runs and ended the Braves' hopes of a
sweep. A crowd of 55,872 screamed their approval and hurled debris
onto the field after Rocker failed to deliver for the first time
this postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baseball gods have been on our side for three games,''
Braves third baseman Chipper Jones said. ``Tonight, they were on
the Mets' side.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Mets have a glimmer of hope _ something that
flickered on and off in Saturday's cliff-hanging game. Neither team
scored _ and barely anyone even hit safely _ until the sixth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were two lead changes, the last coming when Olerud
singled in two runs in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that no one has ever come back from 3-0, but we're not
trying to win three games at one time,'' Mets catcher Mike Piazza
said. ``We still have to win three games, so it doesn't look good,
but we just have to take small steps. Hopefully, this will change
the momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to get any easier, but we're not just going to
lay over and die for them. We're going to battle until the very
end.''
</P>
<P>
   They did just that Saturday, with hard-throwing closer Armando
Benitez gunning down the Braves in order in the ninth to seal the
victory. That was a stage Rocker has dominated in the playoffs;
this time he missed out on another chance at glory by a matter of
inches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried a lot of different approaches against him and
haven't had a lot of success,'' said Olerud, who was 0-for-9 with
five strikeouts in his career against Rocker. ``I was just trying
to get a good pitch to hit. I was looking for a fastball and trying
to adjust to the breaking ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Olerud's two-run single was anything but a scorcher, and it
would have been the third out of the inning had Guillen been
playing more toward second base.
</P>
<P>
   But with the flame-throwing Rocker on the mound, Guillen was
toward the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just hit it in the right place,'' said Guillen, who entered
the game in an eighth-inning double switch.
</P>
<P>
   Said Jones: ``If Ozzie would have been playing a half-step up
the middle, we're out of the inning. It's a helpless feeling. Our
guy was throwing 97 mph; Ozzie was positioned the way he should
have been, it just didn't work out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' Greg Maddux will face Masato Yoshii today in a
rematch of the Game 1 starters, but they'll have to be on top of
their games to match Saturday's performances.
</P>
<P>
   The best pitcher's duel this series has seen was being waged
over the first five innings as the Braves' John Smoltz and Mets
counterpart Rick Reed matched zeros. Smoltz retired 13 of the first
14 batters he faced and Reed sat down 14 of the first 15 Braves who
took hacks at his deceptive assortment of pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz blinked first, allowing a two-out solo homer to Olerud in
the sixth inning. Olerud, who had two hits and no RBIs in his
previous 13 NLCS at-bats, crushed a 1-1 pitch over the right-field
wall to give the Mets a lead for only the second time in the
series.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of actually being in control of a game must have
sent the Mets into shock because two innings later they found
themselves in a familiar position _ trailing and facing the
unenviable task of rallying against a Braves bullpen anchored by
Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Jordan blasted Reed's first pitch of the eighth inning
over the center-field wall and Klesko followed by launching a shot
to right field.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 808 feet later, the Braves held a 2-1 lead and
thoughts of champagne on ice no doubt danced through their minds.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the sixth time a team has hit back-to-back homers in
the NLCS and the first time since the Mets' Darryl Strawberry and
Kevin McReynolds did it in 1988. The Braves' late-inning magic put
a damper on an otherwise brilliant night for Reed, who only allowed
three hits in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have a total of six hits in the last two games and
are hitting .198 in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Braves manager Bobby Cox has made all the right moves this
postseason, but perhaps he should have given Smoltz the rest of the
night off after the Braves took a 2-1 lead in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Cox left Smoltz in to face Roger Cedeno, who opened the
inning with a base hit _ his third of the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to throw him a cutter inside, it came back across the
plate, and he smacked it,'' Smoltz said.
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno stole second and reliever Mike Remlinger walked Melvin
Mora before Cox called on Rocker. Mora and Cedeno pulled off an
uncontested double steal, which turned out to be a pivotal play in
the inning because it put the go-ahead run in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't have looked too good if we had gotten thrown out
at third,'' Mets manager Bobby Valentine said. ``I know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, you just knew that wasn't going to happen on the Mets'
night.

EX-CON SETTING BAR TOO LOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
(PHOENIX) - Maybe it was the 17 years he spent in prison, or maybe
it was the seven he's been out, but James Hamm finally has reached
the point where he has absolutely no self-respect.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Otherwise, he'd never be a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   It's sad, really, because Hamm once showed promise.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, he pleaded guilty to the mur der of Willard J. Morley
Jr. during a botched drug deal. Of those days Hamm has said, ``My
problems were mostly with drugs; that was the core of the diffi
culty.''
</P>
<P>
   For his crime he received a life sen tence and was shipped off
to a maximum security prison, where he could have picked up where
he'd left off, dealing in drugs and death.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Hamm transformed himself from a coldblooded killer into
a reformed, educated man.
</P>
<P>
   He earned a college degree while in prison and began serving as
an advocate for other inmates. He studied the Eastern religion of
Taoism.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, his sentence was commuted by then-Gov. Rose Mofford,
who tried to back out of the deal when she started tak ing
political heat.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm wasn't bitter.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke of understanding the public's concern about releasing
someone who had done what he'd done.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Mofford's decision to rescind Hamm's commutation was
overturned by the courts, and Hamm was freed. &QL; 
SCORES FOR THE LAW
</P>
<P>
   He scored well enough on examina tions to be admitted to Arizona
State Uni versity's law school, from which he graduated.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, when Hamm's self-as surance was at its highest,
he tried to en ter the ranks of society's most valuable profession
_ teaching.
</P>
<P>
   He was offered the chance to instruct criminal-justice classes
at ASU until, once again, weak-kneed politicians caved in to public
pressure and reneged.
</P>
<P>
   It was suggested at the time that Hamm set his sights on a
profession in which honor and integrity don't mean much, in which
prison skills are more valuable than intellect, in which morality
is never a question, because no one has any.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, he chose the law.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Arizona Supreme Court announced that Hamm's name
was among the 436 applicants who had passed the Arizona Bar
examination.
</P>
<P>
   In order to become a practicing attor ney, however, Hamm first
must be ap proved by the Supreme Court's Committee on (I'm not
making this up) Character and Fitness.
</P>
<P>
   According to some of the state Bar's most esteemed members,
there's a good chance Hamm will be rejected.
</P>
<P>
   We can only hope. &QL; 
TODAY'S NEWSMAKERS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who reads the paper or watches TV is aware of lawyers
who've made the news over the past couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   There was the defense attorney who got videotaped at the county
jail while letting a client look too closely at her le gal briefs.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Attorney General's Of fice went after a law firm
for running a bait-and-switch operation.
</P>
<P>
   And just last week, a county prosecutor got arrested and charged
with sexually exploiting minors on the Internet and having sex with
two teenage boys.
</P>
<P>
   It goes on.
</P>
<P>
   The state Bar itself made an out-of-court settlement two years
ago with a for mer secretary who claimed an official there had
``pinned her against a wall'' and pressured her sexually.
</P>

EX-CON SETTING BAR TOO LOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
(PHOENIX) - Maybe it was the 17 years he spent in prison, or maybe
it was the seven he's been out, but James Hamm finally has reached
the point where he has absolutely no self-respect.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Otherwise, he'd never be a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   It's sad, really, because Hamm once showed promise.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, he pleaded guilty to the mur der of Willard J. Morley
Jr. during a botched drug deal. Of those days Hamm has said, ``My
problems were mostly with drugs; that was the core of the diffi
culty.''
</P>
<P>
   For his crime he received a life sen tence and was shipped off
to a maximum security prison, where he could have picked up where
he'd left off, dealing in drugs and death.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Hamm transformed himself from a coldblooded killer into
a reformed, educated man.
</P>
<P>
   He earned a college degree while in prison and began serving as
an advocate for other inmates. He studied the Eastern religion of
Taoism.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, his sentence was commuted by then-Gov. Rose Mofford,
who tried to back out of the deal when she started tak ing
political heat.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm wasn't bitter.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke of understanding the public's concern about releasing
someone who had done what he'd done.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Mofford's decision to rescind Hamm's commutation was
overturned by the courts, and Hamm was freed. &QL; 
SCORES FOR THE LAW
</P>
<P>
   He scored well enough on examina tions to be admitted to Arizona
State Uni versity's law school, from which he graduated.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, when Hamm's self-as surance was at its highest,
he tried to en ter the ranks of society's most valuable profession
_ teaching.
</P>
<P>
   He was offered the chance to instruct criminal-justice classes
at ASU until, once again, weak-kneed politicians caved in to public
pressure and reneged.
</P>
<P>
   It was suggested at the time that Hamm set his sights on a
profession in which honor and integrity don't mean much, in which
prison skills are more valuable than intellect, in which morality
is never a question, because no one has any.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, he chose the law.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Arizona Supreme Court announced that Hamm's name
was among the 436 applicants who had passed the Arizona Bar
examination.
</P>
<P>
   In order to become a practicing attor ney, however, Hamm first
must be ap proved by the Supreme Court's Committee on (I'm not
making this up) Character and Fitness.
</P>
<P>
   According to some of the state Bar's most esteemed members,
there's a good chance Hamm will be rejected.
</P>
<P>
   We can only hope. &QL;

<P>
   Anyone who reads the paper or watches TV is aware of lawyers
who've made the news over the past couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   There was the defense attorney who got videotaped at the county
jail while letting a client look too closely at her le gal briefs.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Attorney General's Of fice went after a law firm
for running a bait-and-switch operation.
</P>
<P>
   And just last week, a county prosecutor got arrested and charged
with sexually exploiting minors on the Internet and having sex with
two teenage boys.
</P>
<P>
   It goes on.
</P>
<P>
   The state Bar itself made an out-of-court settlement two years
ago with a for mer secretary who claimed an official there had
``pinned her against a wall'' and pressured her sexually.

LOSSES PILE UP FOR DALLAS STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Stars defenseman Derian Hatcher looked down,
struggling to find words to express his frustration. ``When it
rains, it pours,'' he finally settled on. He had bigger problems
than a 3-2 loss to the Nashville Predators on his mind. An already
struggling and battered Stars bunch lost more than a game last
night, they lost two more key players to injury. Stars winger Jere
Lehtinen fractured his right ankle in the second period and will
have surgery today. He will miss six to eight weeks. Stars
defenseman Richard Matvichuk will have arthroscopic surgery on his
left knee today and will miss at least 10 to 14 days. The Stars
were already missing defenseman Shawn Chambers (out three months)
and forwards Grant Marshall (eight weeks) and Brian Skrudland
(three to four weeks). ``It's frustrating to be this early and to
try to come out of the funk we're in and have bodies going down
left and right,'' Stars forward Mike Modano said. Yes, what started
out as a simple loss to Anaheim on Oct. 8 has developed into a
full-fledged funk. The Stars are 1-3-1 in their past five games,
scoring seven goals in those games. The games have begun to play
like skipping CDs, too. Start slow, fall behind, mount a furious
comeback late, hope it's enough. ``You can't keep mounting
comebacks,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``It takes a lot of
energy.'' Not even a two-goal performance from Modano could save
the Stars from their slow start last night. By the time Modano
scored his first goal, the Predators had a 3-0 lead. Nashville's
second goal typified what Hitchcock has been complaining about when
he says the defending Stanley Cup champions aren't playing their
game. Stars defenseman Sergei Zubov had pinched in too deep and
committed a turnover, giving Nashville a 2 on 1. Predators winger
Scott Walker faked a slap shot to pull Stars goalie Manny Fernandez
out of position and then passed across the crease to an open Greg
Johnson for an easy goal at 12:40 of the first period. The
Predators had scored just two goals in the first and second periods
combined in their first five games this season. They had three last
night. Nashville's first goal came on the power play. Cliff Ronning
deflected a shot by Craig Millar between Fernandez's pad and the
post at 5:48 of the first period. The Predators' third goal was by
winger Ville Peltonen with 14:39 remaining in the second period.
``So the game isn't even halfway over and we're in a hole,'' Stars
winger Mike Keane said. ``So, you see, it's not really hard to
figure out what our problem is.'' The problem definitely isn't
chances. The Stars had a number of good scoring chances,
outshooting the Predators 38-27. The problem was finishing. Only
Modano was able to do that. His first goal was a result of hustle.
Predators defenseman Drake Berehowsky was going down to touch up
the puck for an icing call and a pursuing Modano instead caused him
to collide with Nashville goalie Mike Dunham. Stars winger Warren
Luhning, playing on the line because of Lehtinen's injury, instead
got to the puck and passed back to Modano, who popped the puck in
from the crease before Dunham knew what hit him. Modano's second
goal was a result of skill. He got behind Nashville's defense, took
a pass from Hatcher and proceed to bury a goal high and glove-side
on Dunham. ``Beside the start,'' Modano said, the sentence cutting
off. The start when compared with the finish was what made the game
that much more frustrating, a popular word in the Stars locker
room. ``I think we're bringing most of the frustration on
ourselves,'' Hatcher said. ``We haven't played well. Tonight's
actually been the best we've played in a little while here.'' And
the obstacles just got a little bigger.

`SEINFELD' CREATOR TRIES FOR LAUGHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
(Undated) - Imagine Seinfeld if it had been on HBO in stead of NBC
and it starred co-creator Larry David instead of Jerry and it had
only been as funny as it was the last couple of seasons.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That pretty much sums up Larry David: Curb Your Enthusiasm. The
one-hour special contains some laugh-out-loud moments but also some
long stretches of humor-free aridness.
</P>
<P>
   One crucial difference: Curb Your Enthusiasm violates half of
David's famous no-hugging, no-learning rule of television.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some hugging at the end of the show,'' David said in
a conference call. ``It was as insincere as you could get. Insin
cere hugging is al lowed.''
</P>
<P>
   Although David, who penned some of Seinfeld's most darkly
brilliant ep isodes, is more or less the model for George Costanza,
he is also a former stand-up comedian himself. He hadn't performed
onstage for 10 years and mentioned to a friend that he was thinking
about giv ing it another shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `You should film it,' '' David said. ``Like
everything else, I was reluctant at first. The more people I asked
about it, everyone seemed to think it was a good idea. I thought it
was a way to motivate me to get on stage.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he wasn't interested in the standard
film-the-comedian-telling-jokes format.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to do something different,'' he said, ``rather than
the straight stand-up show. Then, I started to think I needed some
other stuff in there, what we were going to do offstage. We
couldn't just follow me around the supermarket shopping, so I had
to come up with some stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some stuff' wound up being about 90 per cent of the show, with
the stand-up routines in New York and LA only a small part (a ratio
close to the early episodes of Seinfeld as well.) Curb Your
Enthusiasm turned out to be mostly a mock LA documentary _ totally
unscripted _ about David's return to stand-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not totally mock,'' David said, stressing that revealing
just what is real and what isn't would spoil the fun for viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, the stand-up is real. I would say that there are
elements in there that are real. Most of it's embellished, but some
of it's real.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the genuineness, David said, is his person ality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that much of a character,'' he said of the Larry
David we see on-screen. ``I'm not re ally stretching there. That's
pretty much who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   That Larry David wanders around a good bit, mumbling about life
and its foibles, sounding remarkably like a certain bespectacled,
balding, chunky, self-proclaimed loser from a late, great hit TV
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really resent that `who's call ing?' '' he says while making
a phone call. ``Like some people are good enough to make the cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Alexander, who played George on Seinfeld, makes an ap
pearance, commenting on David. So does Jerry himself, who relates
that during his early stand-up days, Da vid referred to the
audience as ``you people.''
</P>
<P>
   Other comedians show up, as well, including Richard Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a phenomenon,'' Lewis says of David. ``He just couldn't
get over the hump that comedians have to perform in front of other
people.''
</P>
<P>
   David called his stand-up career ``the epitome of a love-hate
rela tionship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the kind of thing where you walk around at times when
it's not going well, you blame it on the au dience,'' he said.
``You think the whole world must be stupid or you stink and have no
talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's going well, you think that you're the greatest thing
on two feet and everybody's brilliant. . . . It's very extreme
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the special concerns other comics telling David how the
clubs have changed in the 10 years since he has been onstage. Of
course, David's life has changed as well. Seinfeld has made him a
wealthy man, in deed. But that's the only change, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty much the same, but I can get dental work in my
house now,'' he said. ``That's the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   David left Seinfeld after the infa mous season-ending episode in
which George's fiancee dies after licking bargain-basement
envelopes, and the show lost its dark New York heart, which made it
so funny. He famously returned for the series-ending show, which
managed to combine excessive hype and mini mal laughs for one of
TV's biggest flops.
</P>
<P>
   David naturally begs to differ.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't be more pleased with it,'' he said of the final
episode. ``First of all, the fact that so many people didn't like
it? I loved that. It accomplished everything I think a finale
should accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he must be delighted with Curb Your Enthusiasm, because
it's far funnier than Seinfeld's finale. Then again, how could it
not be? &QL;

RALLY INSPIRES THOUGHTS OF ANOTHER METS MIRACLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I might be completely off my Rocker, but let me be
the first to float this off-the-wall theory at you: If the Mets can
get a little help from the Great Weatherman in the Sky sometime
today, they might yet pull off the biggest comeback in Major League
Baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, I know. You figure I've overloaded on pastrami at the
Carnegie Deli or that I've spent too much time in the backseat of
New York cabs, dazed by drivers with unpronounceable names who
obviously bought their driver's licenses at the nearest convenience
store.
</P>
<P>
   You might be right. But admit it, you were sitting there with
the remote control in your hand last night, debating about whether
to change the channel after the Braves took a 2-1 lead in the
eighth inning at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   You knew in your heart of hearts that the Mets were done, that
the Atlanta brooms were four John Rocker outs away from the sweep,
and the only reason you didn't push the button was because you
wanted to watch the Braves' closer defiantly stick it to the Mets
and their fans one more time.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Rocker went brain dead _ by most accounts, not exactly
a huge leap _ and the Mets, teetering once again on the brink of
extinction, yanked a heart-stopping 3-2 victory out of thin air.
</P>
<P>
   It could be the start of something big. Something huge. No team
in baseball history has ever come back from an 0-3 deficit in
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Much depends, believe it or not, on today's weather. It's
supposed to rain, starting at about game time, and continue through
Monday. If, say, the game was to be rained out after a couple of
innings and the Braves lost Greg Maddux's start ...
</P>
<P>
   OK, it's a reach, but isn't that exactly what this entire
improbable Mets' season has been? You know how these New York
stories go; they're always bigger than life.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets season was two innings away from being over last night
after Rick Reed, who had pitched superbly, suddenly coughed up a
1-0 lead by serving up back-to-back home runs to Brian Jordan and
Ryan Klesko leading off the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   With the dominating Rocker loosening up in the bullpen, Shea
Stadium immediately went on life support.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of things got kicked \Rin the dugout\S,'' Mets
manager Bobby Valentine conceded.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets once again refused to die.
</P>
<P>
   Consider these improbable events:
</P>
<P>
   A decision by Braves manager Bobby Cox would backfire; a risky
double-steal put on by Valentine would catch the Braves completely
by surprise, setting up John Olerud's game-winning hit; Rocker, to
the delight of the fans, would finally fail.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Cedeno led off the bottom of the eighth with his third
single off Braves starter John Smoltz and Melvin Mora, a
strangely-timed defensive replacement for Rickey Henderson in the
top of the inning, worked a two-out walk off reliever Mike
Remlinger.
</P>
<P>
   Cox waved for Rocker, who had split his time equally between
tormenting the fans and dominating the Mets. Someone in the stands
fired a bottle of water that skipped past him as Rocker ran in from
the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typical,'' he said later.
</P>
<P>
   Cox wanted Rocker to face Olerud, who already had accounted for
the Mets' only run of the night with a long solo homer off Smoltz
in the sixth. With the pitcher's slot due to lead off the next
inning, Cox made the logical double-switch, sending Ozzie Guillen
to replace Walt Weiss at shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker came to the mound with his usual swagger, but he forgot
one thing: the runners.
</P>
<P>
   So Valentine daringly put on the double-steal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we caught 'em a little bit by surprise,'' Valentine
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno and Mora were safe without a throw, setting the stage for
the dramatic finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't thinking about the runners at all,'' Rocker admitted.
``I was concentrating solely on the hitter. Those guys, you make a
mistake to Olerud and he hits one in the gap with two out, they're
going to score anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the runners both in scoring position, it didn't take a
gapper. Olerud, who hadn't touched Rocker the entire series,
chopped a 2-2 fastball back up the middle. It skipped of a lunging
Guillen's glove and rolled into center field as both runners scored
and the stadium erupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the cheaper hits I've ever given up in my entire
life,'' Rocker said. ``If Ozzie's playing one step over to the
left, that ball's fielded cleanly and the play's made and we're
three outs \Rin the ninth\S away from going to the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I've let the fans get in my head, and I've gone
out there and thrown balls to the backstop or gone 3-0 on every
hitter. They think they're in my head, but I'm in their head.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but finally getting to Rocker was a huge psychological
boost for the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as firing the team up, when Johnny got that hit tonight
it was amazing how pumped up that dugout was,'' Mets outfielder
Darryl Hamilton said, ``not only because we got the lead, but
because we got him. That's a good thing. That gets us going for
\Rtoday\S.''
</P>
<P>
   At least it keeps them alive for one more day.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if they can just get a little help from the Weatherman. ...

A NET FOR U.S. RETIREES IN MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RUSS WILES  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) -Charles and Etta Carlis readily admit that the azure
waters, white sandy beaches and one-hour drive to Arizona were the
main reasons they chose to retire in Rocky Point rather than
another Mexican town. But it helps that Rocky Point also has
connections to the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet access was a determining factor,'' said Charles
Carlis, who moved there with his wife from Green Valley two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Carlises monitor their investment portfolio through an
online brokerage account, send e-mail to friends in the United
States and Europe, and make travel arrangements for periodic trips
to America and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really provides a window to the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although parts of Mexico still lack modern plumbing, electricity
and telephone service, the Internet has arrived in many sizable
cities and towns, as well as beachfront retirement communities like
Rocky Point and, farther south, San Carlos.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just a Sonoran phenomenon, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the American communities in Vallarta and Cabo, everybody
uses the Internet,'' said Bruce Greenberg, a real estate appraiser
with offices in Tucson and San Jose del Cabo, at the tip of the
Baja Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet's availability means that American retirees and
other expatriates can take advantage of the slower-paced,
less-costly lifestyle of a Third World nation while tapping into
the commercial, entertainment and informational pulse of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The computer revolution is making it easier for adventuresome
types to settle in exotic foreign locales, especially the first of
the graying baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey by New York-based Scudder Kemper Investments that
was released in late September, only 27 percent of respondents from
the World War II generation (people born before 1933) said they are
connected to the Internet. By contrast, 67 percent of baby boomers
said they are, as did 53 percent of the ``swing'' generation, those
born from 1933 to 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Most expatriates in the Sonoran beachfront communities already
had been in touch with the United States via television _ satellite
dishes are widespread _ along with English-language magazines and
newspapers such as The Arizona Republic. The Internet is a more
recent phenomenon, but one with potentially more impact because of
interactivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to book hotel rooms and concert tickets (in Santa
Fe) right from my home in this sleepy fishing village,'' Charles
Carlis said.
</P>
<P>
   Another invaluable use, as Clyde Berry has discovered, is
researching medical questions. Berry lives with his wife, Kat, and
four children in a white stucco house up a hill from the beach in
San Carlos, a resort and retirement town nearly 400 miles south of
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   He has artificial joints, as well as diabetes and other ailments
resulting from injuries suffered in Vietnam. Mexico's medical
infrastructure clearly is inferior to that of the United States,
but the Internet helps narrow the gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go online a lot to look up health information,'' said Berry,
a former job recruiter from Texas who receives a military
disability pension from the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear exactly how many of the estimated 600,000 Americans
living in Mexico are in Sonora. But expatriates figure there are
perhaps 2,000 permanent residents in the Rocky Point area and at
least 500 in San Carlos. Both communities are growing.
</P>
<P>
   Even for those with Internet access, most Americans head up to
Tucson or Phoenix occasionally to register vehicles, see doctors,
make major shopping hauls and conduct any banking they can't do
electronically or through the mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone down here is technically an Arizonan,'' Berry said.
</P>
<P>
   And there are several thousand more Americans who own property
along the Sonoran beachfront but don't live permanently in Mexico.
Many of these people also like having Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Baldwin, a professor at Arizona State University West, and
his wife, Connie, have had a vacation home in Rocky Point since
1991. Their dwelling lacks electricity, so they have learned to
make do on solar power and propane.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Internet arrived in Rocky Point, they decided to
purchase a small apartment in town, a room in a converted hotel,
that includes an electrical connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought it expressly so that I could go into town and spend
an hour on the Internet to get e-mail, dial into ASU or whatever,''
said Bruce, who teaches accounting.
</P>
<P>
   But although the Internet is making it easier to live in Mexico,
it's certainly not the reason people have relocated there. Water
recreation, a slower pace of life and a lower rate of violent crime
are among the main lures of the Sonoran coast for Americans, along
with a reduced cost of living.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say it's about 30 percent cheaper to live the same
lifestyle,'' said Jeff Reeco, a Realtor with Rocky Point
Reservations.
</P>
<P>
   A live-in maid, for example, costs less than $100 a week, and a
cavity can be filled for about $20, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Berrys say their six-person, two-cat household lives
comfortably on about $3,000 a month, including a mortgage payment
of $1,000, monthly private-school expenses of $60 per child and
meals that average about $1 per person.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, you can buy as many stalks of celery as you need,''
Clyde Berry said. ``You don't have to buy the whole bunch.''
</P>
<P>
   However, computers, television sets and other electronic goods
generally are more costly in Mexico than in the United States, and
so are Internet services. The Carlises say they spend about $280 a
year for Internet access, which includes about 100 hours of usage
each month, generally a higher rate than what's available
stateside.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Internet is opening up new possibilities for people
interested in living in Mexico, its arrival has been something of a
mixed blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Many part- and full-time expatriates say that they bought homes
in Sonora for the peace and quiet and that they don't fully welcome
modern technological intrusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't equipped our (beachfront) home for television
because we like to get away,'' Connie Baldwin said. ``We spend most
of our time down here reading books. What a concept!'' &QL;

TOMLINSON TOPS 1,000 YARDS FOR SEASON IN TCU ROMP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ There may be a long, hard road ahead, but in
their first adventure as the official pariah of the Western
Athletic Conference, the TCU Horned Frogs came through with a
smile.
</P>
<P>
   LaDainian Tomlinson crested the 1,000-yard mark at an earlier
juncture than any back in TCU history, both quarterbacks threw
touchdown passes, the defense created a couple of scores, and Tulsa
was buried, 56-17, before a crowd of 27,957 at Amon Carter Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   And so, after two consecutive blowout victories, the Frogs (3-3,
2-1 Western Athletic Conference) may have created the proper surge
for a trip to Houston next week and a showdown with league-leading
Rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're getting close to being where we want to be,''
coach Dennis Franchione said. ``But when we're ready to start
talking about a championship race, I'll let you know.''
</P>
<P>
   It was another disaster for the Golden Hurricane, (1-5, 0-3)
which lost its fifth consecutive game, in addition to its best
players on offense and defense _ quarterback Michael Wall and
linebacker Ashon Farley _ both of whom departed with knee injuries.
</P>
<P>
   For TCU, it was a night on which almost everything worked, no
matter what.
</P>
<P>
   On an 80-yard run that gave TCU the lead for good in the second
quarter, Tomlinson _ who scored four times and had 178 yards on 16
carries _ was afraid he had stepped out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took the pitch, and it seemed like the line had kind of
walled off the defense,'' he said, ``and I saw a little seam and
took the sideline. I didn't know if I had stepped out, but I didn't
hear a whistle so I just kept running.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson eventually cut back inside cornerback Todd Franz for
the score that put TCU ahead, 14-10, with 3:04 left in the half. He
finished the evening with 1,060 yards in six games, surpassing
Kenneth Davis _ who was watching from the sidelines _ as the
quickest Frog to reach that plateau. Davis did it in seven games in
1984.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Shannon Brazzell intercepted a pass at the Tulsa
15, returned to the seven, and set up a 5-yard touchdown run by
Patrick Batteaux for a 21-10 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs, who had the ball for only 24:44 in the game, then
scored 35 points in the third quarter. Almost nothing could go
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   On a 50-yard scoring pass to Mike Scarborough, quarterback Casey
Printers thought he had created a collision.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I faked to LT, I saw the safeties coming up, so I threw
to Mike,'' he said. ``Then I saw Kevin Brown going over into the
same area, and I said, `No! No! get out of there.' ''
</P>
<P>
   No problem. Scarborough made the catch, shook off Franz, and
scored easily.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, LaTarence Dunbar was rushing the Tulsa punter and
fell down. But Chad Bayer managed to block the punt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I jumped up, and the ball hit me in the face mask,'' Dunbar
said, ``so I just ran it in for the score \R10 yards\S.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the game, Scarborough caught another touchdown pass
_ 15 yards from Batteaux _ and Tomlinson scored twice more. It was
56-10 going into the fourth quarter, and Franchione cleared the
bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had two unfortunate injuries, and I feel bad for them,''
Franchione said of Tulsa, which managed only 216. ``We really made
good use of our time with the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it looks a little strange. In weighing time of
possession against points, always take points.''
</P>
<P>
   With Batteaux rushing for 77 yards, Dunbar adding 45 on four
reverses and Printers throwing for 94, the Frogs managed 465 yards
in 56 plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing better offensively, Casey is getting more
comfortable, and LaTarence is becoming a weapon,'' Franchione said.
``We've played so well lately, I don't know how to act.''

FANTASTIC CAVERNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KATHLEEN INGLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) - For the first time, the public is getting a look at
the fantasy world of stone beneath southeastern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Glistening straws, massive columns and shimmering, calcified
curtains are wowing visitors on practice tours as Kartchner Caverns
prepares to open next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's overwhelming,'' said Susan Strachan, a Phoenix resident
who took one of the test tours in early October.
</P>
<P>
   With lighting kept low to avoid generating heat, ``you really
feel like you're in a cave and not an exhibit someone made of
fiberglass,'' Strachan said.
</P>
<P>
   Her only disappointment: She didn't get a ``cave kiss,'' a drop
of water from the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Dripping water is what makes Kartchner so unusual. It's a
``living cave,'' where the formations, never touched by humans, are
still growing as water deposits minerals, drop by drop.
</P>
<P>
   Kartchner Caverns State Park, nine miles south of Interstate 10
at the Sierra Vista/Fort Huachuca exit, opens to the general public
on Nov. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibits in the Discovery Center tell visitors about how the
cave was formed and the creatures that live there, including bats.
A multiscreen video recounts how Tucson cavers Gary Tenen and Randy
Tufts discovered Kartchner in 1974, and how the park was created.
</P>
<P>
   The hole that the two men shimmied down is now fenced off. The
entrance for tours was cut into the hillside nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Kartchner is being developed in two phases, and the second will
be a separate tour with a different entrance, expected to open in
two to three years.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors take a tram for the quarter-mile trip up the hill from
the Discovery Center to the cave. The entrance is cut into a
limestone slope covered with prickly pear cactus, spiky agave
bushes and ocotillo.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could be more different from the cool, moist darkness of
the cave, where the average temperature is 68 degrees and doesn't
vary more than 1 degree year-round. Water evaporates 800 times
faster in the desert, and the cave would be sucked dry within days
if outside air rushed in.
</P>
<P>
   To make sure that doesn't happen, visitors go through a series
of three air locks.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the tour shows visitors the wide variety of playful
shapes that built up over the millennia from calcium carbonate.
Ribbons of striped rock run along the ceiling, with colors that
make it clear why these formations are known as ``bacon.'' Dainty
curlicues, called helictite, curl upward in ways that seem to defy
gravity.
</P>
<P>
   Two large rooms the size of football fields are the highlights.
The Rotunda Room has a broad floor of cracked mud, which turns into
a lake during periods of heavy rain. A single path with deep
footprints leads across it, the trail by Tenen and Tufts. They were
careful to use the same path over and over, leaving mud flats that
have never had a footprint.
</P>
<P>
   A thicket of ``soda straws'' hangs from the ceiling at the far
end of the room, and a change in lighting spotlights how a single
drop hangs at the end of each one. The straws grow as slowly as 1
inch every 750 years. Kartchner has one soda straw that extends 21
feet, the second-longest in the world. To protect it, that part of
the cave never will be open to tours.
</P>
<P>
   The Imaginary Passage takes visitors to the Throne Room. The
name for the corridor doesn't come from anything amazing about its
appearance but from the fact that the engineers never imagined the
route would work out.
</P>
<P>
   The ornate and massive Kubla Khan column, five stories high,
dominates the Throne Room. It's the one place where State Parks
gets fanciful. While music wells up from hidden speakers, a light
show dramatizes the spires and swirls of rock.
</P>
<P>
   The reviews were mostly positive from visitors on one practice
tour. However, Stefanie Cargill of Tempe, found the music ``a
little unnecessary.''
</P>
<P>
   But she praised the overall use of lighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wonderful,'' she said. ``The lighting allowed people to
see how the water is still running on the cave formations, and I
think that's really important. Nowadays, you see something shiny,
it's plastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Cargill and others were also impressed with the elaborate steps
to preserve the delicate cave environment, techniques that put the
state's newest tourist attraction over budget and off schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Kartchner is opening two years later than planned. The budget
ballooned to $28.4 million, nearly two-thirds higher than the
original estimate of $17.5 million, and State Parks may still have
to add money from other department funds.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the financing breakdown: 60 percent from State Parks user
fees, 18 percent from the Heritage Fund (drawn from the state
Lottery), 12 percent from the state general fund, 8 percent from
transportation funding and the rest from other sources.
</P>
<P>
   To Phoenix resident Margaret Burns, a surprising part of the
tour was learning how much work it took to open the caves to the
public without damaging the fragile environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed at all the work that was done inside,'' she said.
``Now I understand why it took as many years as it did. I've been
at a couple of other caves. This is just magnificent.'' &QL;

WHEREVER IT WAS, TCU IS BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ You're not going to believe this, but there
was a fleeting stretch in last night's TCU gigglefest where it
actually looked like the visitors could win.
</P>
<P>
   Saw it myself.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be an illusion, of course. Just more Stupid WAC
Tricks.
</P>
<P>
   LaDainian Tomlinson took a second-quarter pitchout, crossed
through several time zones, and that was that. The Horned Frogs
were on their way to harnessing the Tulsa Golden Hurricane, 56-17,
and launching an atmospheric mini-disturbance of their own.
</P>
<P>
   They're back. Back in the Western Athletic Conference hunt. But
don't expect them to say that _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a topic,'' head coach Dennis Franchione announced. ``I'll
let you know when we're ready to talk about that.''
</P>
<P>
   They're back, though nobody can really say where they're back
from, nor whether they were ever on the brink of that perch to
begin with.
</P>
<P>
   In two weeks of playing at Amon Carter Stadium, the Frogs have
outscored guests, 98-17, and leveled their season record at 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing about these two weeks is that we came home and
got back to playing TCU football,'' Franchione said. ``There has
been a confirmation of some things about ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Their faith had been shaken, in other words. The Frogs had
failed to finish the job in a season-opening loss to nationally
ranked Arizona. A punchless 10-point loss to a very beatable
Northwestern team came the next week.
</P>
<P>
   But in the WAC, it isn't over until it's over. And even then,
there are still two more time zones to go through.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, here we were in the first quarter last night, watching the
Golden Hurricane blow through like a bad cold front. For 15 curious
minutes, Tulsa's John Mosley, not Tomlinson, looked like the
nation's leading ground gainer, and Hurricane quarterbacks were 6
for 6 through the air.
</P>
<P>
   But something possessed Tulsa quarterback Michael Wall to call
his own number on a third-down play at the TCU 14. The Frogs'
Reggie Hunt met him head-on at the 6, and Wall didn't get up.
</P>
<P>
   Wall had injured a knee, putting the night in the hands of
heralded freshman Josh Blankenship. Whatever edge that the
Hurricane had was swiftly lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had two really unfortunate injuries,'' Franchione
graciously noted. ``We didn't expect to get 56. We expected it
would be a close game.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's the WAC for you. A little defense can get you a long
way. In two weeks, you can be exactly where Fresno was.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs are back. Wherever they were.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious of the differences are Tomlinson and freshman
quarterback Casey Printers. Except for the night when Fresno State
swaddled him in attention, Tomlinson has run with increasing
confidence each week. Printers, meanwhile, seems to have come miles
since his anxious debut at Northwestern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't reach into my pocket and hand him experience,''
Franchione said.
</P>
<P>
   And he's right. But Fran still was the one who was wary about
handing the keys to a freshman in the first place. Franchione
selected senior Patrick Batteaux to quarterback his team against
Arizona and Northwestern.
</P>
<P>
   A bad decision? Hindsight would look at TCU's 1-3 start and
conclude yes. But there are hundreds of college coaches who would
start a senior over a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   Printers' best moment last night was a 50-yard scoring pass to
receiver Mike Scarborough. Batteaux remains the option specialist,
but when Printers sprints out, defenses seem to thin quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing a few things he didn't do in the first few weeks,''
Franchione assessed. ``And I think he's going to play better and
better.''
</P>
<P>
   And none too soon, because there are more Stupid WAC Tricks just
ahead. With Fresno State losing to SMU and, in effect, coming back
to the conference pack, the Frogs find themselves on a collision
path with ... well, Rice.
</P>
<P>
   The WAC's big game next week _ are you sitting down, Darrell
Royal? _ is going to be TCU at Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Based upon last night, the Frogs appear ready over the next two
weeks to tackle the WAC's rugged outback, which in this case is
downtown Houston and Honolulu. They have the nation's most
productive running back. They have the league's best scoring
defense. They have found their quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   They're back. Back from Northwestern. Back from Fresno.
</P>
<P>
   And where to now?

NHL FANS SHOULDN'T NEED A LOAN FOR TICKETS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Jennifer Floyd 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Welcome to Nassau Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Come on in. Sit down wherever. Plenty of seats to choose from,
well, at least there were last game.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, when the New York Islanders played a game against the
Atlanta Thrashers on Thursday night, 5,219 tickets were sold for
the game. However, a turnstile count showed only 3,062 were in
attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Nassau Coliseum holds 16,297 fans.
</P>
<P>
   Want to take a stab at why?
</P>
<P>
   Simple numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Not win, losses or goals scored, but P.P.T. That's price per
ticket, and the NHL leads the four major sports in the average
P.P.T. according to a survey published by Chicago-based Team
Marketing Report, Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it costs more to go to an NHL game than an NFL, NBA or MLB
game.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL led the pack last year, but in a strong off-season move
the NHL passed them. Commissioner Gary Bettman has to be so proud.
</P>
<P>
   The average P.P.T. in the NHL is $45.70 this season compared
with $45.63 for the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two important factors continue to play into the continuing
increase in NHL ticket prices,'' said Matthew Freedman, editor of
Team Marketing report. ``First, teams obviously are trying to keep
pace with escalating player and operational costs. Second, a
significant amount of NHL teams consistently sell 80 percent or
more of their tickets, so they have yet to see any significant
price resistance from fans.''
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto Maple Leafs lead the league in P.P.T., averaging a
cool $69.92 a ticket to see the Maple Leafs. That's U.S. dollars,
too. The Calgary Flames are the cheapest, averaging a $27.85 a
ticket. The Stars rank sixth with an average ticket price of
$50.87. If you want to bring your family of four with two small
beers, four small Cokes, four hot dogs, two caps, two programs and
parking, the price tag will be $272.99. The league average is
$254.58.
</P>
<P>
   Can you say loan?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and by the way, the Islanders rank 26th in the NHL in P.P.T.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets? $34.68.
</P>
<P>
   Beer? $5.50.
</P>
<P>
   Parking? $5.50.
</P>
<P>
   Cap? $15.00.
</P>
<P>
   Staying home and watching ``ER''? Priceless.
SPOTLIGHT
Jill Johnson Luc Robitaille, shown taking a shot against Ed
Belfour, has quietly moved to the early lead in the NHL scoring
race.
Robitaille makes noise as scorer, no kidding
Before this season started, everybody wanted to know who was going
to take Wayne Gretzky's spot as one of the best scorers.
</P>
<P>
   The answer would come in the statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Well, coming into this weekend, Los Angeles Kings forward Luc
Robitaille was second in the NHL in scoring with seven goals and
three assists.
</P>
<P>
   Luc Robitaille?
</P>
<P>
   There isn't a mistake. Heck, he's only 20 goals short of tying
Maurice ``Rocket'' Richard's total of 544. ``I didn't know that,''
Robitaille said. ``That certainly was the guy, you know, he's
certainly a special player. He's more than a player to most of us
back there. To be near him in any kind of statistic is pretty
special. It certainly would be an honor if I could pass him.''
</P>
<P>
   The honor is even bigger considering where Robitaille had fallen
during his three non-LA seasons.
</P>
<P>
   He began his career with the Kings in 1986 and in his first
eight seasons he had 803 points, including a 63-goal, 62-assist
season in 1992-93. But in 1994-95, he went to Pittsburgh and then
spent the following two seasons after that with the New York
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996-97, he played in 69 games and amassed 48 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were tough years in New York,'' Robitaille said. ``You
know, it was one of those situations where I didn't get injured for
like eight or nine years in a row. Then suddenly, for like three or
four years in a row, I got injured every time I turned around, it
seemed like. It was just a tough situation there.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then, yet, I learned a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Luc Robitaille that returned to the Kings last season and
started this season on such a tear wasn't the same one that left.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't a 50-goal scorer anymore, but then again hardly anybody
is.
</P>
<P>
   What is a good goal scorer nowadays?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. You'd have to go to arbitration and find out,''
Robitaille joked. ``I don't know what the title is, but I do know
that scoring 30 goals today is a lot different than the way it was

   \Nsubheds:Around the NHL From the get-over-it files: As the
banner commemorating the Buffalo's Eastern Conference playoff
championship reached the rafters of Marine Midland Arena during its
home opener on Oct. 8, the 18,690 Sabres fans in attendance started
chanting, ``No goal, no goal, no goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The outburst, of course, was in reference to Stars winger Brett
Hull's Stanley-Cup clinching goal in overtime of Game 6 of the
Stanley Cup Finals. Buffalo contends Hull's skate was clearly in
the crease and the goal shouldn't have counted. The NHL changed the
rule during the off-season, a good time for Sabres fans to maybe
move on.
</P>
<P>
   The last undefeated team in the NHL no longer is undefeated.
When Phoenix defeated Ottawa, 4-3, on Thursday, the Senators became
like everybody else. Of course, the league isn't without winless
teams. The Buffalo Sabres, the Boston Bruins, the Philadelphia
Flyers and the Chicago Blackhawks have yet to defeat anybody.
</P>
<P>
   Fax machines all over the NHL were buzzing this week. Edmonton
forward Bill Guerin said since the Oilers can't afford to sign him
they need to trade him. Edmonton general manager Glen Sather wasn't
talking, but that didn't stop Guerin's camp from jamming the fax
lines announcing his availability. The problem? Sather is ornery
and has time on his side. The issue? Guerin wants $3.5 million a
season. The Oilers are offering $2.5 million. He made $1.5 million
last season. Look for this to drag on for a while.

TEXAS RANGERS FANS SILENT IN FACE OF BREAKING UP TEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Until proved otherwise, I'll consider Rangers fans'
generally apathetic reaction to the potential breaking up of their
team a case of Post-Yankees Shock Syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   How else to explain the universal yawn when owner Tom Hicks,
less than 24 hours after the Rangers had faded meekly into the
October night for a second consecutive season, announced that
sweeping changes are coming for next season, including the likely
trading of Juan Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   That's future ``Hall of Famer'' Juan Gonzalez, in case you've
forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Hicks' response was just your typical knee-jerk reaction
to another devastatingly disappointing Rangers October, but he
sounds like he's serious.
</P>
<P>
   So get ready to say goodbye to the team that just won a
franchise-record 95 victories and won the American League West for
the third time in four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, here are a few questions to mull around while we wait
for general manager Doug Melvin to start gutting his team:
</P>
<P>
   Q _ How do you trade your two-time MVP and cleanup hitter, let
your second baseman, third baseman and center fielder become free
agents, talk about trading your first baseman/DH (Lee Stevens),
replace at least three of them with rookies and convince your fans
that now you're ready to beat the Yankees?
</P>
<P>
   A _ Can you say 85 wins and goodbye playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   Q _ Since the payroll might drop by as much as $15 million, this
means a big cut in ticket prices, right?
</P>
<P>
   A _ Yeah, right.
</P>
<P>
   Q _ Does this mean that Hicks, portrayed as the first real
``Daddy Warbucks'' the Rangers have ever had, likes the Stars more
than he does his baseball team?
</P>
<P>
   A _ I know, the Stars won the Big One and the Rangers only won
division titles three of the past four years. If Mike Hargrove can
be fired after winning five consecutive division titles,
everybody's vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Q _ Has anyone with the Rangers asked Rafael Palmeiro, who
thought he was signing a five-year deal with a perennial contender,
how he feels about the team trading Gonzalez and the other proposed
changes?
</P>
<P>
   A _ I didn't think so.
</P>
<P>
   Q _ Finally, if the Rangers trade Gonzalez, who drives in their
only run every October?
</P>
<P>
   A _ Oh yeah, I forgot. We won't have to worry about October.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, I'm not saying that the Rangers don't need to shake things
up some. But with 11 free agents already on the roster, including
Todd Zeile, Mark McLemore and Tom Goodwin, change was already
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not even totally opposed to trading Gonzalez _ though I get
this sick feeling in the pit of my stomach when I think about him
playing somewhere else _ if the right deal (solid starting pitcher,
decent young outfielder and at least one hotshot prospect) is out
there.
</P>
<P>
   I'd just feel better about it if that decision hadn't been made
while the bitter taste of another Rangers failure against the
Yankees was still sour in everyone's mouth.
</P>
<P>
   One lesson Hicks could learn from Jerry Jones: Never let your
money get mad. Have we already forgotten how much better it is to
get to the playoffs, no matter how brief the stay, than it is to
not get there at all?
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:Greer for the defense No one was more astounded at the
criticism he received for his defensive play against the Yankees
than was Rusty Greer, who lost a line drive in the lights in Game 1
and couldn't catch up to Scott Brosius' double off the wall in Game
2. It was that drive, dissected on TV replays, that brought most of
the criticism down on the Rangers' left fielder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why that play was ever an issue,'' Greer says.
``When the ball was hit, I thought I had a play on it. I got a good
jump on it. Halfway there, I thought I could get it. Three-quarters
of the way there, I still thought I had it. It just flat beat me to
the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like I jumped and then it hit the wall. It hit
before I could get there. I jumped because I was in no-man's land.
I'd already committed and couldn't back out. But as it turned out,
I had no chance.''
\Nsubheds:Raffy rejects ESPN ESPN approached Rangers first baseman
Rafael Palmeiro about doing some color analysis during the ALCS,
but he rebuffed the offer because the invitation came when the
Rangers were down 0-2 to the Yankees and he didn't want to be
thinking about anything but Game 3.
\Nsubheds:It's a stickup Besides the $2 million upfront fee that
TCU will fork over to become a member of Conference USA, the Frogs
must also compensate other league members for lost revenue in its
first five years, due to the conference financial pie being divided
up in smaller pieces with the addition of another team. That
stipulation didn't faze TCU's commitment, a source close to the
negotiations says, because the school figures the extra money
brought in by more TV appearances, wider national exposure, etc.,
makes it a wash.
\Nsubheds:No golden tones One more reason to hate New York: Robert
Merrill can't sing any more. Somebody needs to tell him.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, I know, he still sings better at Yankee Stadium than the
Rangers play there.
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:Wilt no dummy Memory lane: Remember when Wilt
Chamberlain was going to climb into the ring to fight Muhammad Ali?
He wisely changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the time Wilt made a cameo appearance as a

sure the king's daughter reached her destination safely and with
virginity intact. Insert 20,000 laughs here.
</P>
<P>
   May all of Wilt's free throws hit nothing but net.

halftime,'' Armstead says, ``it's off my back and I take that favor
back. Just don't boo me.''

</P>
<P>

like the rest of us get flu shots.

   The movie was inspired by the tiny Milan High School team of
1954, which won the Indiana state championship competing against
much larger schools. Hackman's character was loosely based on head
coach Marvin Wood, who died last week at 71, a victim of bone
marrow cancer.

Nations?
</P>
<P>
   Just in case you were wondering, Wilt Chamberlain was nicknamed
``The Big Dipper'' because he had to duck under low-hanging pipes
in the gym where he learned to play basketball as a kid, not
because of the alleged sexual exploits he once bragged about.

Hmmmmm.

NOTRE DAME RALLIES TO BEAT USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BEND, Ind. _ The endings remain the same, but it's the
plot twists that keep getting harder and harder for USC to grasp.
</P>
<P>
   When the Trojans leave Los Angeles and play a real opponent,
they lose. It's only becoming more inexplicable to understand how
it happens.
</P>
<P>
   And no loss this season is likely to seem stranger than
Saturday's to Notre Dame. The Trojans blew a 21-point second-half
lead and lost 25-24 in front of 80,012 at Notre Dame Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It will go down as one of the biggest, um, choke jobs in the
storied rivalry. Notre Dame had not had a comparable
come-from-behind victory since trailing Houston by 22 points in the
1979 Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   To add insult, it happened to be the 25th anniversary of USC's
24-point comeback victory over the Irish.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were an innocent bystander, or an observer at this
football game, it was a hell of a game. I can't say that,'' USC
coach Paul Hackett said. ``It's a thrill to be here, but God it's
painful.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans (3-3) played their best half of the season and built
a 21-3 halftime lead before a tongue-tied Irish crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage grew to 24-3 when David Newbury kicked a 29-yard
field goal with 12:22 left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Trojans fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might have gotten tight or nervous,'' free safety David
Gibson said. ``Who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   Everything just changed. Every big play in the second half was
Notre Dame's, and the Trojans were their usual befuddled selves
trying to protect a lead.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an anatomy of a disaster, South Bend style.
</P>
<P>
   _Trailing 24-3, quarterback Jarious Jackson threw a third-down
screen pass to Tony Fisher, who came up 3 yards short.
</P>
<P>
   But USC strong safety Ife Ohalete was called for a personal foul
against wide receiver Bobby Brown, and the play turned into a
23-yard gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ref said I pushed him in the face. I was pushing him
back,'' Ohalete said. ``But I'll take responsibility. It turned the
game around.''
</P>
<P>
   The Irish scored five plays later and it was 24-10.
</P>
<P>
   _Later in the quarter, USC quarterback Mike Van Raaphorst
dropped back to pass and fumbled after being hit. Notre Dame (4-3)
recovered on the USC 36.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it was a fumble,'' Van Raaphorst said. ``He hit
me pretty hard, but I thought my arm was going forward. It probably
wasn't though.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst was right the second time. It was a fumble. Notre
Dame responded with a touchdown and USC led 24-16.
</P>
<P>
   _Early in the fourth quarter, USC punted from its own 33-yard
line, and Mike MacGillivray unleashed an 11-yard punt.
</P>
<P>
   ``To shank the punt in the game was symptomatic of the whole
second half,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   USC's defense, which was probably feeling like a punching bag
thanks to the offense's woes, held the Irish to a field goal and
the Trojans held a five-point advantage (24-19).
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense was on the field too much in the second half
because our offense is inept,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   _Then came the controversy, no surprise to USC at Notre Dame
Stadium. On third-and-8 from its 46, Van Raaphorst found Windrell
Hayes, who caught the ball but was ruled out of bounds by the
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Replays indicated Hayes had a foot inbounds after making the
catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was in,'' Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst was livid over the third-down pass, saying, ``That
was one of the worst calls I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of having the ball inside the Notre Dame 35, the Trojans
punted.
</P>
<P>
   _With three minutes left, Notre Dame reached the USC 18.
Jackson, who missed last year's game with a knee injury, went back
to pass and instead raced toward the end zone. Zeke Moreno and Matt
Childers both had a chance at tackles but missed, and Jackson
reached the 3.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Kris Richard then stripped the ball from Jackson and
it rolled into the end zone. Notre Dame's Jabari Holloway recovered
the ball for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   USC thought it had the ball _ briefly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had it, but it popped and squirted loose,'' Ohalete said.
``I saw it pop out and went right to the ground but we didn't get
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame led 25-24 with 2:40 left, but USC still had a time
for a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   R. Jay Soward (10 catches, 101 yards) returned the kickoff 36
yards, but was gang-tackled and, as he lost momentum, the ball was
pulled loose and Notre Dame recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was saying to myself, `Fall down R. Jay, fall down.' But
something inside me was saying `Don't fall down, R. Jay, you can
break out of this and go,''' Soward said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had someone take the ball from me like I was a
3-year-old with a lollipop and an older brother takes it and says,
`Its mine.' That's what they said, `It's mine.' That's the play
I'll always remember because we lost to Notre Dame.''
</P>
<P>
   USC got one last shot, when linebacker Markus Steele forced a
fumble and Ennis Davis recovered. But the Trojans' drive stalled
when Van Raaphorst's fourth-down pass was deflected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were too sloppy in the second half,'' Hackett said. ``I
don't think I can say anything good about it. We had the ball
numerous times in the second half and couldn't make the play. We're
not a consistent football team yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially on the road.

CAL SHUTS OUT UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ UCLA's playbook is deep and dynamic, complex
and cutting edge _ a hybrid of tomes used by the Denver Broncos and
Green Bay Packers. It has a remedy for every defense and an option
(or three) for every situation.
</P>
<P>
   But it had nothing for this. There's no chapter for ineptitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cal kicked our fannies,'' Bruins coach Bob Toledo said, and he
was being kind.
</P>
<P>
   On a hazy October afternoon, with a cool breeze from the south
and a bitter wind in the UCLA locker room, the Bruins could not
run, they could not pass, they could not block and they could not
score.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a great offense,'' fullback Durell Price said after
UCLA's 17-0 loss Saturday, in front of 55,559 in the Rose Bowl.
``Everybody's seen what we can be, last year and this year. We were
great last week. But to be blanked at home? That should never
happen. Man, I'm (angry).''
</P>
<P>
   The vaunted UCLA offense was shut down and shut out for the
first time since a 21-0 loss to Washington State in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Final score aside, it was UCLA's worst offensive performance
since a 38-3 loss to Michigan in 1996. In that game, sophomore
quarterback Cade McNown completed 8 of 27 passes for 39 yards and
three interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, redshirt freshman quarterback Cory Paus completed 9 of
28 passes for 81 yards and one interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a horrible effort on my part,'' Paus said. ``When
I had time to throw, I wasn't hitting.''
</P>
<P>
   But Paus did not cause the carnage. The trouble started on the
line of scrimmage, where Cal's defense manhandled UCLA's offensive
line.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins (3-4, 1-3) did not carve running lanes and they did
not protect Paus, who was hit hard and hit early. They didn't get a
first down in the first quarter. Tailbacks Keith Brown and Jermaine
Lewis combined for 17 yards. On one play, Paus was sacked by six
Cal defenders as his lineman watched helplessly. Heck, the loudest
cheer came when the USC score was announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We billed this as a battle up front,'' Bruins right tackle
Brian Polak said. ``It was our front seven against their front
seven. And they won. They had an answer for everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bears are big and fast and mean and the best defense in the
Pacific-10. They held Nebraska to 114 yards rushing in Lincoln.
They lead the conference in sacks (31). They have two immovable
tackles, Jacob Waasdorp and Jeremiah Parker, and the best pass
rusher in the west, junior Andre Carter.
</P>
<P>
   But they aren't this good. UCLA was just that bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awful, just awful,'' offensive coordinator Al Borges
said. ``I don't know what to tell you. I'd like to sugarcoat it,
but I can't.... By the end of the game, they were convinced they
could stop us with nine guys, and they probably could have.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's offense praised the defense _ how's that for a change? _
because it held Cal to 17 points and 371 yards and caused three
turnovers. But those are misleading numbers, since the Bears
average 16 points and 236 yards and have the worst offense in the
Pac-10. What's more, the Bruins allowed Cal to convert
second-and-26 and third-and-25 predicaments on the game-clinching
touchdown drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't get anything generated offensively, and that put
pressure on the defense,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, UCLA's undoing wasn't three hours of ineptitude or
defensive breakdowns, but its failure to convert three scoring
chances when the game was close.
</P>
<P>
   The first came early in the second quarter, with Cal leading 7-0
and UCLA perched on the Bears' 46. Paus had time to throw and
receiver Freddie Mitchell was open near the goal line. But the pass
was a wobbler, ugly and underthrown, and Cal cornerback Chidi
Iwuoma intercepted at the 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have made them pay three or four times that I
missed,'' Paus said. ``They have a great defense, but we should
have played better. They shouldn't demolish us.''
</P>
<P>
   Two possessions later, the Bruins were moving again. Paus found
Danny Farmer for one first down and scampered 10 yards for another.
But at Cal's 37, he was hit from behind and fumbled. The Bears
recovered, ran out the clock and took a 7-0 lead into the locker
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game was a matter of who wanted it more,'' Carter said.
``We knew we had to come in here and dominate for four quarters.
The bottom line was who was going to play with passion and heart.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's last chance came on a trick play late in the third
quarter, when reserve quarterback Drew Bennett _ he of the bad
elbow and mediocre arm _ faked an option run and threw an errant
pass to Farmer. Cal safety Damian Marzett intercepted at the 2, and
the Bruins were out of chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played it better than we executed,'' Toledo said.

   NEW YORK _ The . . . Mets live. The . . . Mets live.
</P>
<P>
   Mets first baseman John Olerud had been struggling at the plate.
But he broke out in a big way Saturday &UR;  &LR; night at Shea Stadium. And
as a result, New York stunned the Atlanta Braves, 3-2, to avoid a
sweep in the National League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   Was it a breakthrough game, Mets manager Bobby Valentine was
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't win, obviously it doesn't allow us to play
(Sunday),'' Valentine said. ``That makes it a great breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have been a resilient team all season and they did it
again Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   They were nearly knocked out of the playoff picture by the
Braves when they lost five of six games in late September.
</P>
<P>
   They still face a huge task. But at least they get to play
another day.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Maddux will be on the mound for the Braves Sunday, opposed
by Masato Yoshii of the Mets in a pitching rematch of Game 1, won
by Atlanta, 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were down, 2-1, and staring down the end of their
season after Brian Jordan and Ryan Klesko finally got to starter
Rick Reed for consecutive home runs to open the eighth inning. Down
to their final four outs, the Mets were left to face fireballing
lefthander John Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Cedeno led off with his third single, but Rey Ordonez
popped up a sacrifice bunt for the first out.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Remlinger relieved starter John Smoltz and struck out Benny
Agbayani. But a walk to Melvin Mora put two men on.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker came on to face Olerud, who struck out against the closer
in Games 1 and 2.
</P>
<P>
   On a 1-and-1 pitch, Cedeno and Mora pulled a double steal to
move up to second and third.
</P>
<P>
   Three pitches later, Rocker made his first mistake of the
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fastball, down and away,'' he said. ``Right where I wanted
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Olerud went after it. Topped it. And it headed up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Ozzie Guillen couldn't reach the ball with his glove.
Olerud had a two-run single and the Mets had a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good hitter,'' said Rocker. ``He didn't hit it well.
But he hit it well enough. It's kind of that old saying, he hit it
where we weren't. He didn't get a good piece of it, but he got it
through. It counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Armando Benitez came on in the ninth and closed the Braves out.
Guillen lined out to right field, Gerald Williams flied out to
right, and pinch hitter Keith Lockhart struck out to end it.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud had just two hits in 13 at-bats in the series when he
came up in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   And he crushed a Smoltz offering for a solo home run to right
field and a 1-0 Mets lead.
</P>
<P>
   But the Braves, who turned Game 2 around over the course of just
a few pitches, did it again.
</P>
<P>
   Reed was cruising along with a one-hitter until the eighth.
Jordan crushed the first pitch of the inning for a homer to
left-center field. Reed threw a ball to Klesko before the first
baseman hit a fastball out the other way.
</P>
<P>
   Three pitches, two home runs, and the Mets' 1-0 lead was
suddenly a 2-1 hole. That was it for Reed, and Turk Wendell got the
Mets out of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   But things were looking mighty bleak.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt about it,'' Reed said. ``But (Olerud's hit) squeaked
through. At a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   A very good time for the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they must win Sunday to send the series back to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got to beat us three more times and they've only
beaten us four times all year. Yes, I'm still confident,'' Rocker
said.
</P>
<P>
   But at least the Mets are alive.

HASSELBECK-DEWALT COMBINATION A LOCK FOR BC 
</HEADLINE>
 COLLEGE-PITTSBURGH-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was a doubleheader of delirium.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day the Red Sox _ playing a few stops down the Green
Line _ resuscitated their playoff hopes with a resounding thumping
of the Yankees, Boston College's football team gave new life to its
season with a 20-16 victory over the Pittsburgh Panthers
Saturday &UR;  &LR; night before 33,527 at Alumni Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing missing from the celebration of BC's fifth
victory was Lou Bega's ``Mambo No. 5'' over the sound system.
</P>
<P>
   Scratched as the starter because of a mild right shoulder
separation, quarterback Tim Hasselbeck came off the bench with
10:17 remaining in the third quarter when Brian St. Pierre suffered
a concussion and threw the winning touchdown, a 36-yarder to
Dedrick Dewalt with 1:48 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that, for once, we made a play when we
needed a play,'' said BC coach Tom O'Brien, whose Eagles improved
to 5-1, 2-1 in Big East. ``A great catch by Dewalt down the
sideline and then the defense really came up big there in the last
series. We hung around and we hung around. When the opportunity
came we made a play, and that's the difference in the football
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasselbeck completed 13 of 24 for 202 yards and two touchdowns
to outshine Pitt sophomore David Priestley, who relieved starter
John Turman and completed 20 of 30 for 291 yards and one touchdown.
Priestley was harrassed by a rabid BC defense _ in particular
senior tackle Chris Hovan (8 tackles, 2 sacks, 1 forced fumble, 2
hurries). Hovan and company pressured Priestley, particularly on
Pittsburgh's last series, which ended when a 26-yard completion to
Antonio Bryant on fourth and 28 from the Pitt 10 came up short.
</P>
<P>
   Hasselbeck twice connected with Dewalt (5 catches, 90 yards) for
touchdowns, including a 35-yard strike that lifted BC to a 13-13
tie with 1:54 left in the third quarter. But Nick Lotz gave the
Panthers a 16-13 lead with 13:17 to go on a 25-yard field goal, his
third of the game after converting a pair of 29-yarders. Hasselbeck
then touched off the wild celebration by hitting Dewalt with the
winner.
</P>
<P>
   When he dropped back on the play and saw Dewalt facing press-man
single coverage, Hasselbeck tried to look off the safety at
midfield ``and push him as far to the left as I could with my
eyes,'' he said. ``Once I felt like I needed to get rid of the
ball, with the protection letting up, I knew where I was headed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just one of those things, where I just trusted that he
was going to be there. I knew he was going to be there for me.
Shoot, Ded and I have done it about 300 times when no one's been
looking, so it was about time we did it when someone was.''
</P>
<P>
   Dewalt, sitting next to Hasselbeck, smiled in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pretty much saw the same thing as Tim,'' Dewalt said. ``I
just knew it was press-man coverage and I knew if I could win at
the line (of scrimmage) then it would be 6. I knew Tim was going to
make a great throw and I knew I just had to do my part and make the
catch.''
</P>
<P>
   It absolved Dewalt of a drop he had three plays earlier when he
and Hasselbeck tried to connect from 55 yards out.
</P>
<P>
   ``That ball went right through my hands,'' Dewalt said. ``I
hadn't forgotten about the play, but I knew I had to make something
big because I didn't want to go back to my room tonight thinking
about that same play. So I knew I had to do it not just for myself,
but for the team and the defense because they played a hell of a
game tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Hovan led the charge of BC's defensive brigade, which held the
Panthers to 391 yards total offense and stepped up its play when
Priestley tried to engineer a last-minute drive. Priestley found no
refuge in the pocket when he was sacked on back-to-back plays,
forcing the fourth and 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this was the most excited locker room since I've been
here,'' Hasselbeck said. ``Even the Hawaii game, when Chris (Hovan)
and I were freshmen (in 1996). It's a good lift for us, because one
thing Coach O'Brien said was, `Don't let Temple beat you twice,'
meaning don't dwell on last week. We didn't do that and now we've
got to get ready, because we've got some really tough opponents
(Miami and Syracuse the next two weeks) coming up.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, hopefully, this will give us a little momentum.''

KINGS RUN OUT OF GAS IN EDMONTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta _ If there was anything flatter than the
prairie between here and Calgary, it was the Los Angeles Kings
during critical stretches of Saturday night's 5-4 loss to the
Edmonton Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly they had a chance to win in the final seconds after
Glen Murray scored his third goal of the game and the Kings pulled
goalie Stephane Fiset. But for the first time this season they
could not outhustle the fatigue of starting the year with seven
games on the road.
</P>
<P>
   They were outshot 15-3 in the second period when the Oilers
rallied from a one-goal deficit. And when the Kings tied the game
early in the third on Murray's second goal, Edmonton responded with
two goals in the next six minutes to regain the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care when the winning goal was scored,'' said captain
Rob Blake, whose power-play goal with 8:33 left cut the Oilers'
lead to 4-3. ``This game was lost in the second period. We didn't
have anything during that time and that is when they took over the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a game that could have sent the 4-2-1 Kings home as the
talk of the town. With the Staples Center set to open for hockey
Wednesday night with a game against Boston, the team's surprising
start has given them the air of a playoff contender.
</P>
<P>
   No one was using fatigue as an excuse, certainly not coach Andy
Murray. He wants accountability to be this team's legacy, not tired
legs. The flight from Calgary after Friday night's 4-1 victory was
45 minutes and the players could have been in bed before midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, for the first time this season, the Kings trailed
heading into the final period. And they could see it coming.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Kings were the aggressors in the first period when
Murray gave them the lead with a power-play goal, tipping in a
drive by Garry Galley from the point with Edmonton's Christian
Laflamme off for charging.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt great to finally get it,'' Murray said. ``There were
plenty of chances this season, but they just hadn't gone in. I knew
if I kept working, one would go in. I guess they come in bunches.''
</P>
<P>
   But after the first 20 minutes Saturday, the Kings suddenly were
skating in sand and failing to make passes. Against Edmonton
(2-2-2), one of the league's quickest teams, they were regularly
beaten to the puck.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Smith and Alex Selivanov scored in the second to give
Edmonton a 2-1 lead. Smith's was on a screen shot, Selivanov's came
on the power play with Blake off for interference with just over
two minutes left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Murray tied the game, but defenseman Tom Poti gave Edmonton the
lead with his first goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Just over a minute later, Daniel Cleary blew past Donald
Audette, skated behind the Kings' net and planted a wrap-around
goal past Fiset, who has played all but one period so far this
season.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, when Cleary walked up to Fiset untouched and scored
the eventual winning goal with less than seven minutes to play, it
was clear the Kings were drained.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we have to work through,'' said Glen Murray.
``I'm not buying that we were tired, but we only played 40 minutes
tonight. We learned you can never even take a period off.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Saturday, Murray was the only member of the first two
units without a goal. He watched Friday night as linemates Audette
and Bryan Smolinski scored their first goals of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Those two had taken over that game, allowing the Kings'
productive first group a night off. But Saturday, first liners Luc
Robitaille, Ziggy Palffy and Jozef Stumpel were stopped again.
Stumpel had two assists and Palffy one, but both were missing in
the second period when the momentum shifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look back at the trip and I saw a lot of good things,''
Blake said. ``But a game like this reminds you that there still is
a long way to go.''

MATADORS PUTTING UP A GOOD FRONT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After going through several combinations on the
defensive line, Cal State Northridge found one that worked in
Saturday's 36-14 win over Sacramento State.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors went with quickness instead of bulk, replacing Sean
Beard (5-foot-10, 290 pounds) with Erik Gardner (6-6, 240).
Gardner, Jason Mageo (6-0, 249) and Shawnbay Jones (6-3, 265)
combined for eight tackles and pressured Sacramento State
quarterback Ricky Ray.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have found a defensive front and scheme that fits us,
personnel-wise,'' said CSUN interim head coach Jeff Kearin.
</P>
<P>
   Ray was sacked three times and hurried several others. He threw
two interceptions in the first quarter, including Mel Miller's
record-breaking 90-yarder for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were `defensive-pressure' interceptions,'' Kearin said.
``Those were team interceptions all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones got a few hits on Ray early and said he could see a
pattern developing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pressure early was getting into (Ray's) head,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   First with a bullet: Miller's interception was the first of his
two-year CSUN career. He broke the school's second-oldest
individual defensive record: Jack Burkett's 88-yarder came on Oct.
19, 1963, one month before the assassination of John Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't just going to fall down on the ground,'' Miller said.
``I was hoping to score.''
</P>
<P>
   Broken record: Jaumal Bradley is proving to be one of the best
running backs in the Big Sky. Bradley had 132 yards on 30 carries
Saturday, giving him 446 yards in four games.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's per-game average is 111.5 yards, and he's the first
CSUN tailback to rush for more than 100 yards in three consecutive
games since Robert Trice did it in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can somehow be a threat running the ball ... we can play
with anybody,'' Kearin said.
</P>
<P>
   Injury report: The Matadors had two offensive linemen go out of
the game with injuries on successive plays in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Nick Longshore, the starting left tackle, went down
with a shoulder injury and starting center Julio Alcala left with a
sprained ankle. Both players are expected to start this week.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley bruised a knuckle on his right hand late in the game,
but the injury is minor.
</P>
<P>
   Big kick: Fittingly, a CSUN alumnus became the second person to
win the $10,000 punt, pass and kick contest during halftime. Rod
Shinko, 31, won the money after kicking a 25-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Shinko played tight end at CSUN in 1988 and '89.

NORTHRIDGE SMACKS SACRAMENTO STATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The sound of the pounding was all around them, and
all they could do was sit in their cramped locker room and take the
emotional abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a year later, Cal State Northridge's football players
answered Sacramento State for the Hornets' postgame taunting of
1998.
</P>
<P>
   And they answered emphatically.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors threw the Big Sky Conference standings for a loop
with a 36-14 victory over the Hornets in front of a homecoming
crowd of 5,183 at North Campus Stadium on Saturday. CSUN improved
to 3-3, 2-2 in the conference, and Sacramento State dropped to 4-3,
2-3.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the CSUN players left the field without shaking hands
with the Hornets. That's how badly they resented the taunting that
took place after last year's 35-21 upset loss at Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have a rival in the Big Sky,'' said safety Steve Forte,
who had a first-quarter interception that set up a field goal.
``They were banging on the walls, the doors, making a lot of noise.
We didn't want them to come down and do what they did to us last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Tailback Jaumal Bradley agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very excited about playing Sacramento State after the
humiliating loss last year and the embarrassing things they did to
us after the game,'' he said. ``They ran us out of the stadium,
literally.''
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors didn't let that happen with an inspired defensive
performance against one of Division I-AA's top offenses. Sac State
didn't approach its per-game average of 38 points and Charles
Roberts, the nation's leading rusher, was held almost 20 yards
below his average of 185 per game.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, who had 231 yards against CSUN last year and already
had 1,112 this season, had a quiet 167 on Saturday. He didn't have
two consecutive long runs and never dominated a drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave up some yards but we were resilient,'' defensive
lineman Shawnbay Jones said. ``It was going to be hard for us to
contain (Roberts), but we did it.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense did it by eliminating the silly mistakes that had
made most of the first five games unbearable for the coaching
staff.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive linemen didn't buckle against a bigger offensive
line, the linebackers didn't let Roberts out of their grasp and the
defensive backs rarely were beaten.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN sacked quarterback Ricky Ray three times and intercepted
him twice; Ray entered the game with just three interceptions in
151 attempts this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really, really proud of the defense,'' CSUN interim head
coach Jeff Kearin said. ``They responded to a challenge. I've been
as critical of (the players) as anybody, and they've been critical
of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were the ones who believed in themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The festive crowd _ CSUN's largest of the season _ were
believers after the first quarter. The Matadors took a 17-0 lead
and dominated the stat sheet, outgaining the Hornets 121-50 and
holding the ball for almost four more minutes (9:21 to 5:39).
</P>
<P>
   The week before, the Matadors took a 10-7 lead at Montana, then
went into the tank in the second quarter. That didn't happen this
time, and Terrence Jones' 74-yard touchdown pass from Marcus Brady
_ CSUN's longest offensive play this season _ made the lead 23-6
with seven minutes left in the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Matadors) came in with emotion,'' said John Volek,
Sacramento State's head coach. ``Somewhere along the line, we lost
our emotional edge. They brought the fight to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a senior, overcame a dropped pass on a sure touchdown on
CSUN's first play to have a career-best nine catches for 141 yards.
Freshman Joe Gilliam, starting in place of injured Aaron Arnold,
had eight receptions for 99 yards and a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Five different players scored touchdowns for the Matadors,
including Bradley, who had a career-high 132 yards. CSUN rushed the
ball 43 times and had the ball almost 10 more minutes than
Sacramento State.
</P>
<P>
   If not for Roberts' 28-yard run with a minute left, Bradley
would have had the better game, at least statistically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my defense I wanted to out-rush (Roberts),'' Bradley
said. ``Some people looked at me like I was crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN improved to 3-0 at home this season and the completeness of
the win put Brady in a good mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we can go out and party,'' he said. ``We can enjoy the
rest of the night. No more moping around.''

NORTHRIDGE DEFENSE DEFENDS ITSELF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ So what's all this stuff about Cal State
Northridge having the worst defense in the country?
</P>
<P>
   Try telling that to Sacramento State, which was averaging 43
points a game through five weeks, then managed just a pair of
touchdowns in a 36-14 loss to the Matadors on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Or how about Sacramento State's Charles Roberts, the nation's
leading rusher. Roberts was a non-factor Saturday, despite gaining
167 yards. The majority came after the first half _ with a good
chuck coming on a meaningless last-minute drive _ and he never did
reach the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge continually pressured Ricky Ray, forcing him into two
early interceptions, one of which was returned for a school-record
90-yard touchdown by Mel Miller.
</P>
<P>
   The worst defense in the country?
</P>
<P>
   Northridge is ranked last among NCAA Division I-AA teams, once
giving up 456 yards rushing to Eastern Washington, and then 402
yards passing to Montana. But for one week, at least, the Matadors
corralled the second-best offense in the Big Sky Conference and now
have a cornerstone from which to build.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was as good of a defensive effort as I've seen since I've
been here,'' said Matadors coach Jeff Kearin. ``Especially with how
we've been playing and with some of the things that have been
exposed in certain areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The key was getting an early lead, then stopping Roberts, who
came in averaging 185 yards per game. That forced the Hornets to
throw the ball.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike past weeks when Northridge got burned through the
air, this time a relentless pass rush and sound play in the
backfield kept Sacramento to a manageable 276 yards _ 91 of which
came on one play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we worked as a unit, we had everything clicking,'' said
Miller, whose long touchdown return broke a 36-year old school
record. ``We played as one unit, and we got the job done.''

GALAXY CLEARS THE AIR DURING SAN DIEGO TRIP
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The mini-camp in San Diego this week seemed
to bring the Los Angeles Galaxy closer together.
</P>
<P>
   After an eight-month season of highs and lows, Los Angeles is
ready to test its mental preparedness when it plays Colorado today
at the Rose Bowl in the opener of a first-round, best-of-three
Major League Soccer playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid checked his team into a San Diego hotel
for three days and they returned to Pasadena on Thursday with a
fresh outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the time of year when it really counts. It's
do-or-die,'' said Galaxy goalkeeper Kevin Hartman. ``Our going to
San Diego was a team-building exercise so that we're mentally
focused. We're going into this thing as a unit, instead of as
individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   The camp had its effect on everyone. The players were allowed to
offer opinions or air frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   Mauricio Cienfuegos started to scribble what he wanted to say in
English but finished with an impassioned plea in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Sigi did the right thing,'' Clint Mathis said. ``He's
trying to get more team unity right before going to the playoffs
and it's working. And just to get us a breather from L.A. really
showed how much he cares about this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is much work to do on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado arrives in desperation. The Rapids were on their way to
the Western Conference title before they self-destructed.
</P>
<P>
   They have won one of the past 10 games in regulation. They have
scored only three goals in their past 13 matches. And worse, they
have gone scoreless for an MLS-record 499 minutes _ and counting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't read into all that stuff too much,'' Mathis said.
``Sometimes, you bring your own luck. This is the same team we
split two games with this season. It will come down to the same
things: Who's willing to work harder and who's willing to do what
it takes to win.''

USC HAS NO ANSWER FOR SLIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BEND, Ind. _ Quarterback Mike Van Raaphorst had as much
trouble explaining USC's pathetic offensive performance in the
second half as he did leading it after the Trojans' 25-24 loss to
Notre Dame on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how the offense could disappear in the second half and
score only three points after scoring 21 in the first half, Van
Raaphorst was unable to provide an answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked again how the offense stalled, the normally placid Van
Raaphorst became a little angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm done playing psychologist. We didn't execute,'' he said.
``It's frustrating, you know. I'm sorry. I don't mean to come up
with an attitude, but it was a big game, and we lost and I'm ticked
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst was probably upset because, for the second
straight week, he had to answer questions about negative plays.
Last week, USC coach Paul Hackett pretty much singled him out for
fumbling a snap on fourth down as the Trojans were trying to come
back against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Van Raaphorst had to explain how he fumbled again,
while trying to pass in the third quarter. He was hit by Notre
Dame's Ron Israel, and the Irish recovered and eventually scored a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, USC had a sure touchdown when R. Jay Soward
broke 10 yards behind the defense on a flea-flicker play. But Van
Raaphorst's pass died and the ball fell at Soward's feet.
</P>
<P>
   On USC's final possession, Van Raaphorst underthrew tailback
Frank Strong, then had a fourth-down pass deflected.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the plays that are remembered, especially with the
strong-armed Carson Palmer unable to play because of a broken
collarbone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to analyze anything right now,'' Van Raaphorst
said. ``I don't know. I'd love to have the answer but I don't right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Hackett seemed to come up with an interesting theory on why
the offense _ and Van Raaphorst _ struggled. He claimed the wind
shifted dramatically in the fourth quarter. Instead of being at
USC's back, it was in its face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely remarkable. It just completely shifted,'' Hackett
said. ``Someone elbowed me, and said, `Now they've changed the wind
too.' That is what happens when you play at Notre Dame Stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Hackett quickly added that a change in wind would
only affect USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind doesn't matter with (Notre Dame quarterback) Jarious
Jackson because his arm's so strong,'' Hackett said. ``But with Van
Raaphorst it does. The wind is very important because of the ball
he throws. It kind of floats.''
</P>
<P>
   People just seem to notice Van Raaphorst's shortcomings. Never
mind that he set a career-high in yardage (298) and tied
career-high in completions (23) and attempts (41) against the
Irish.
</P>
<P>
   The only numbers that mattered were the three points that USC
scored in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't make first downs,'' Van Raaphorst said. ``That's
what happens.''

NFL PLAYERS SIDE WITH REWARDS OF THE GAME OVER RISK OF INJURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Daryl Johnston remembers watching Michael Irvin run a quick
slant-in for the Cowboys at Philadelphia on Sunday, a play that
Johnston has seen Irvin run a thousand times.
</P>
<P>
   This time, after a seemingly routine tackle, Irvin lay
motionless on his back, still clutching the football. Johnston's
world stopped. He could hear his own breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Move something, Michael, move ``something'','' Johnston
remembers saying to himself.
</P>
<P>
   The reality of the sport had reared its ugly head again: Michael
Irvin wasn't moving anything.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 20 minutes passed. As Irvin was lifted onto a flat board
and placed on a stretcher, he could feel movement in his hands for
the first time since the hit. Another five minutes ... finally
movement in his legs as Irvin was being taken by ambulance to a
downtown Philadelphia trauma center.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin is considered lucky because he can feel his 2-year-old
son's tiny hand inside his hand as they walk together. Never has
such a small hand felt so big to the 33-year-old Irvin, who has won
three Super Bowls, played in five Pro Bowls and has set every major
receiving record in Cowboys history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all understand the risk that comes with our jobs,'' said
Irvin. ``Mike Modano, myself and a lot of other guys. ...''
</P>
<P>
   But is the risk of winding up on a stretcher _ or not being able
to feel your son's hand _ worth the reward of playing this game?
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it is,'' said Johnston, an 11-year veteran who was
placed on ``injured reserve/out for the season'' last month at the
urging of spine specialist who found through a magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) the early stages of a second herniated disk in 23
months.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1997, Johnston underwent surgery to have the C-6 and
C-7 vertebrae fused. The latest bulge is just above that fusion, at
C-5 and C-6, or two fingers width above the bone at the base of the
cervical spine. Even a frightening injury, however, isn't always a
deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have things in life that I never would've had without
football,'' the 33-year-old Johnston explained. ``Nobody in this
room ever thinks of a catastrophic injury, I can assure you of
that. You know there's the potential to be injured when you walk on
the football field. But you can't let that be in your mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We laugh about it ... this isn't a contact sport; it's a
collision sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston and wife, Diane, are expecting the couple's first child
in January. Last week, Johnston began some light weight-training
and said that he will evaluate his future at the end of this
season.
</P>
<P>
   There is almost an oath of silence that is taken among NFL
players when it comes to their own vulnerability. The mere speaking
of it, even the mere thought of it, is considered taboo.
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith, in his 10th season with the Cowboys, received neck
and back sprains when he landed on his head while diving over the
pile in the 1996 season-opener at Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously there are risks in this game,'' said Smith. ``There
are risks from the day you step on the football field. There also
are risks walking out of here and driving down the street.
Everywhere you go, there are risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you just don't think of it in terms of, `OK, I run the
risk today of getting out of my bed, walking out of my house,
getting in my car, driving down the street, and having a truck
blast me from the side.' You just don't think about it like it. You
come in here, you get dressed and you treat it like a normal day.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Johnston: ``Everybody in this locker room understands that
there are certain things that you are going to deal with in life
because you played the game of football.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have had their share of career-threatening, and in
some cases career-ending, injuries to the neck, head and back.
</P>
<P>
   Tight end Jay Novacek, a five-time Pro Bowler for the Cowboys
(1990-96) missed the entire '96 season with a degenerative back
condition before retiring.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Charles Haley, now with the 49ers, underwent a
microscopic lumbar discectomy before the Cowboys' 1994 season,
missed five games in '95 because of a disk injury, and has retired
and unretired a couple of times since.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, quarterback Steve Young met with his
neurologist this week to seek answers about his future. Young
received his fourth concussion in three seasons Sept. 27, and has
been suffering from postconcussion syndrome ever since. There is
speculation that he might retire this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that I can't risk the future,'' Young told reporters
this week. ``I have a whole life ahead of me, and I don't want to
miss any of that, so I know that's very important. And the risks
that you face playing football have to be weighed in ... but I'd
really like to play football.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Drew Dossett, a Dallas spine specialist who performed
Johnston's surgery two years ago and is now treating Irvin for his
spinal injury, said that football players constantly face the
``risk vs. reward'' issue. But these are highly paid athletes, so
the question gets tougher to answer the longer we ask it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot to consider,'' said Dr. Dossett, who was a
linebacker at the University of Southern California in 1979 and
1980. ``If I offered you dinner at Del Frisco's to walk across the
street, you'd say, `Hmm, not much risk, good benefit, OK, I'll do
it.' Now if I offered to take you to McDonald's to walk across LBJ
Freeway at rush hour, you'd said, `High risk, not-so-good benefit,'
and probably wouldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   So every injury situation is different. But the game is the same
for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came into the league in 1989,'' said Johnston, ``there
were maybe one or two 300-pound guys on each team, and I don't even
know if everybody had one. Now there are 10-12 300-pound guys on
each team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has become a year-round business. Players are conditioning,
lifting, working out in the off-season, and that's creating a
bigger-stronger-faster football player, which in turn makes for
more violent collisions. Then you put these guys on \Rartificial\S
turf ... and don't tell me it doesn't matter. We have an injury
called `turf toe.' We never had `grass toe' when the game was
played only on grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just basic physics. The speed, the impact and the force
created on these fields is drastically increasing.''
</P>
<P>
   And so are the career-threatening risks.
</P>
<P>
   Dossett compares the head-and-shoulder impacts frequently
incurred in football with that of ``walking on a concrete floor
with a pair of hard-soled shoes and two bad knees'' for the rest of
us.
</P>
<P>
   ``The energy must be transmitted somewhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dossett understands both sides _ treatment and recovery. A torn
anterior-cruciate ligament in his left knee ended his career. After
what he called ``two failed ACL reconstructions that were done back
in the Dark Ages, 1979 and 1984,'' he entered medical school.
</P>
<P>
   He has compiled a list of ``five tips'' that can help players
avoid spine injuries in a sport that is becoming increasingly more
and more problematic:
</P>
<P>
   1. ``Don't play football.''
</P>
<P>
   2. ``Be blessed with good genetic structure.''
</P>
<P>
   3. ``Develop strong neck muscle to dissipate the energy \Rfrom a
blow to the head, back or shoulders\S.
</P>
<P>
   4. ``Learn excellent technique.''
</P>
<P>
   5. ``Luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, even in medical terms, it's a risk.

CAL'S HARRIS KICKS UCLA OUT OF GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The best player on the field did not run the
ball, did not catch a pass, did not make a tackle or score a point.
But Cal punter Nick Harris made his presence felt each time he
uncoiled his right leg.
</P>
<P>
   Harris not only averaged 53 yards on seven punts, he dropped
three inside the Bruins' 10-yard line and was the reason UCLA's
average field position was its own 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a huge impact,'' Bruins coach Bob Toledo said. ``That's
why we went after him (tried to block the punts) every time except
once. We tried to get him off his rhythm. He leads the Pac-10. He
didn't hurt himself today.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris, a junior, entered the game as the nation's No. 4 punter,
averaging 47 yards. Saturday, he was even better: subtract the two
chippies he tried to drop inside the 20 and Harris averaged an
astounding 58.6 yards on his five open-field punts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's two years in a row he's killed us,'' Bruins receiver
Danny Farmer said. ``He put them inside the 10, inside the 5. We
had terrible field position all day.
</P>
<P>
   ``And what really hurt was we didn't move the ball enough to put
them in bad field position.''
</P>
<P>
   Handle with care: UCLA's season may hinge on how freshman
quarterback Cory Paus responds to his 9-of-28 performance, which
included an interception, a fumble and several bad throws to open
receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very fragile,'' Toledo said. ``I don't want to destroy
him. He's going through a growing process.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins expect more inconsistency from Paus, who was bad
against Arizona State, great against Oregon, then awful against
Cal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a young guy who played against a mean defense,''
offensive coordinator Al Borges said. ``He's been thrown into the
fire because we thought he was the best quarterback. With that, you
take the bitter and the sweet.''
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: Reserve linebacker Ali Abdul Azziz sprained his
left shoulder and is questionable for the Oregon State game.
</P>
<P>
   Tailback DeShaun Foster (sprained ankle) is doubtful. The Bruins
don't want to risk aggravating the ligaments on Oregon State's
artificial turf.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: UCLA had three penalties for 15 yards. Cal had
14 penalties for 117 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears had a 38-22 advantage in time of possession.
</P>
<P>
   Cal converted 8 of 17 third-down attempts, while the Bruins
converted 3 of 14.
</P>
<P>
   Cal freshman tailback Joe Igber rushed for 113 yards _ 26 more
than UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Ryan Roques led UCLA with 11 tackles.

BUDROYALE PULLS OFF UPSET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ Budroyale, the feel-good story of the
thoroughbred summer, must not be aware the seasons have changed.
</P>
<P>
   It's autumn now, the time of year for Breeders' Cup preps, races
designed for hugely talented horses like General Challenge, the Bob
Baffert-trained 3-year-old gelding who was heavily favored in
Saturday's Goodwood Handicap at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   But Budroyale, the 6-year-old gelding plucked from a $50,000
claiming race in 1998, refuses to get out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   When General Challenge, with jockey David Flores, ranged up on
the outside in the stretch, he appeared to have the $500,000
Goodwood in the bag, and his fans looked ahead to the $4 million
Breeders' Cup Classic and a Horse of the Year coronation.
</P>
<P>
   Budroyale and Garrett Gomez wouldn't let General Challenge go
past, though, holding on to win the 1[-mile race by a neck at 9-1
odds. Old Trieste was a solidly beaten third in a field of six.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to say anymore,'' said Jeffrey Sengara, the
owner who has watched the overachieving Budroyale dominate the
Mervyn LeRoy Handicap, run second in the Californian and the
Hollywood Gold Cup, and win the Longacres Mile this year, going
over $1 million in career earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The 17th victory in 43 starts was the biggest upset yet for the
son of Cee's Tizzy. And, barring injury, it sends him on to the
Nov. 6 Breeders' Cup Classic at Gulfstream Park near Miami, where
he'll challenge the best horses in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact he can look these (Goodwood) horses in the eye and
gun them down means we'll have to consider (the Classic),'' trainer
Ted West Jr. said.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert, who will run contenders in five of the eight Breeders'
Cup races, had to be disappointed by General Challenge's loss to
the seemingly outclassed Budroyale in the slowest Goodwood
(1:48.31) in seven years. The Santa Anita Derby winner had looked
like a champion when he won Del Mar's Pacific Classic the last time
he ran.
</P>
<P>
   But Baffert offered an excuse: Flores let General Challenge drop
back to fourth on the backstretch, seven lengths off the pace set
by Hollycombe and Old Trieste, leaving too much ground to make up
on the Santa Anita oval.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, he'll come out (healthy) and that'll set him up for
the Breeders' Cup,'' Baffert said.
</P>
<P>
   Budroyale's victory was one of several upsets on a day of major
Breeders' Cup preps around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Artax ($5.70), a rare winning favorite, broke Groovy's Belmont
Park 6-furlong record, clocking 1:07.66 to win the Forest Hills
Handicap by 6{ lengths under Jorge Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   Julio Canani-trained Silic ($6.40) and Corey Nakatani won the
Oak Tree Mile over Bouccaneer and favored Brave Act at Santa Anita
to earn a trip to the Breeders' Cup Mile on turf.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Frankel-trained Kentucky Oaks winner Keeper Hill ($11.40)
snapped a 10-race losing streak by knocking off Banshee Breeze in
the Three Chimneys Spinster Stakes, Keeneland's prep for the
Breeders' Cup Distaff.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Desormeaux, who rode Keeper Hill, came back an hour later
to send Richter Scale ($24.80) to a gate-to-wire victory over Bet
on Sunshine and Vicar in the Phoenix Breeders' Cup Stakes, a
Breeders' Cup Sprint prep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I missed the earthquake in California, but I think we created
one at Keeneland,'' Desormeaux said, noting the winner's fitting
name.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Laffit Pincay sent Testimony between horses on the far
turn in Saturday's sixth race and went on to victory No.8,800. That
put him within 33 of Bill Shoemaker's career record. The Daily
Racing Form announced Friday it has added two overlooked wins _
from Panama and Sweden _ to Pincay's total.... Pat Valenzuela, 1
for 48 in his comeback when Saturday began, won aboard Amber's Cup
and Suzie Snoop.

UCLA DEFENSE MAY BE IN NEED OF FACE-LIFT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Early Saturday the tectonic plates did a
jagged nip-and-tuck job in Ludlow. In a matter of seconds the earth
visibly altered its appearance in the region, proving anew that in
Southern California face-lifts aren't just the domain of the aging
and the narcissistic.
</P>
<P>
   They are all the rage, literally, from the ground up.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, we'd like to suggest some cosmetic surgery
for the UCLA defense, which looked haggard in a 17-0 loss to Cal at
the Rose Bowl on Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   We're not talking about anything earth-shaking. With only minor
alterations, the defense that faces Oregon State next week could
look decidedly younger.
</P>
<P>
   We can't promise the procedure will be painless. It'll hurt
senior defensive backs Ryan Roques and Eric Whitfield to be cut out
of the starting lineup like they were moles or something.
</P>
<P>
   But the ugly truth is, UCLA isn't going anywhere _ not even to
Oahu for the Aloha Bowl _ unless its tightens up its defense. We're
not saying Roques and Whitfield were the only ones to blame for the
breakdowns that begat the Bears' first and final touchdowns.
However, they are the ones with the least amount of time left to
atone for their mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   By promoting, say, freshmen Audie Attar and Lovell Houston to
starters, UCLA wouldn't necessarily be surrendering the season and
they just might be saving it.
</P>
<P>
   The worst thing that could happen is Attar and Houston repeat
the mistakes of their elders and learn lessons that will prove
valuable one, two and three years (instead of just weeks) down the
road.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine Attar or Houston looking any more helpless
than did Roques and Whitfield _ three-year lettermen, both _ on the
27-yard scoring pass from former Hart High standout Kyle Boller to
fellow freshman Joe Echema midway through the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Echema managed to slip in behind Roques in zone coverage and
Whitfield was a couple of steps late getting to the ball.
</P>
<P>
   That gaffe might have been forgotten if not for the stunning
33-yard run by Cal sophomore tailback Saleem Muhammad in the fifth
minute of the fourth quarter, with the Bruins still only one quick
strike from tying the game at 7.
</P>
<P>
   On a third-and-25 call, Muhammad got the ball and ran right up
the middle. He trampled Roques and left Whitfield grasping at air
on his merry way into the end zone for the score that put the Bears
up 14-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears converted another third-down play on their next drive
and capitalized with an 18-yard field goal that grounded any hopes
the Bruins harbored of pulling off the kind of comeback Notre Dame
had earlier in the day at home against USC.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins (3-4, 1-3) would do well to say a prayer of gratitude
to the Irish for rendering their ineptitude the secondary story of
the day in greater L.A.
</P>
<P>
   The UCLA secondary's deficiencies can't be solved overnight
because they were three years in the making. In 1995, 1996 and 1997
the Bruins recruited nine defensive backs (three in each class). Of
those nine, only Whitfield and Roques are leaving fingerprints on
this season.
</P>
<P>
   The others are either riding the bench, lining up at linebacker,
injured (see Jason Bell) or, in the case of junior Marques
Anderson, watching from the stands in street clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is in the midst of a one-quarter suspension levied as a
result of two off-field disciplinary incidents. ``It's hard,''
Anderson said as he surveyed the Bruins' locker room after the
game, ``because I've not only hurt myself, I'm hurting the team.
Ryan and Eric are doing their best, we just need more depth at DB.
When I come back, I've just got to try to make up for it by making
a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Until that time arrives next fall, Toledo and defensive
coordinator Bob Field have to figure out a way to smooth over those
big-play wrinkles that are becoming a real eyesore. It says here
they should let their lineup pens be their scalpels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's on the spot more than I am to have the right guys in
there,'' Field said. ``Do you ever get to a point in the season
where you say there's too much water under the bridge and get ready
to play guys for next year? That would be the head coach's call.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course. It's Bob Toledo's shoulders on which the success or
failure of the team ultimately rests. As dusk settled over the Rose
Bowl on Saturday, Toledo sounded like he might be ready to lighten
his load.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may come to the point if it seems the seniors might not be
performing, it's time to look at other people,'' Toledo said,
heaving such a heavy sigh we half expected the door he was
approaching to shut from the gust.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult because the seniors have put a lot of time into
the program.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a fickle thing, time: Sometimes it confers wisdom and
sometimes it just causes age spots.

SCHMID MAKING GALAXY OF A DIFFERENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Los Angeles Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid has seen
it all in 20 years as a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   He's seen his share of know-it-all kids, like Paul Caligiuri,
Seth George, Zak Ibsen, Ante Razov and Joe-Max Moore, who made his
19 years at UCLA more challenging than he ever could have imagined.
</P>
<P>
   He's seen 16-year-old players lie to get out of training, then
call him when they needed to be bailed out of jail. And he's seen
parents try to get him fired.
</P>
<P>
   But seeing and believing have been the key to Schmid's
considerable success.
</P>
<P>
   He learned much of what he knows through watching other coaches.
Then he made believers of his players.
</P>
<P>
   He would watch UCLA basketball coach John Wooden scold Bill
Walton in Bruin practices at Pauley Pavilion. He followed coach Pat
Riley during his championship runs with the Lakers in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1984 Olympics in L.A., Schmid was in charge of
coordinating soccer practice sites for Brazil, France, Yugoslavia,
Italy and all the others. But he used the opportunity to study
training methods and learn the behavioral patterns of different
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   The son of German parents who moved the family to the United
States when he was 5, Schmid became friends with German World Cup
icons Lothar Matthaeus and Jurgen Klinsmann, often pursuing their
advice. And he spends quiet evenings reading about some of the best
coaches soccer has ever produced.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you watch guys like Riley or Wooden, you're not watching
the plays, but how they motivate,'' Schmid said. ``You want to know
how these guys put their presence on the practices.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmid said he once asked Klinsmann what he liked about certain
coaches and what he remembered most about training sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he liked a coach he could be personal with, like Franz
Beckenbauer,'' Schmid said. ``And what he loved about Beckenbauer's
training sessions were the five-vs.-five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``And in my conversations with (U.S. national coach) Bruce
Arena, it always seems like the best teams play a lot of
five-vs.-five. You can hide in nine-on-nine or eight-on-eight, but
you can't hide in a small game. And it has everything -- finishing,
attacking, defending and intensity. It's a great mini-game.''
</P>
<P>
   The five-on-fives and other motivational tools helped make
Caligiuri and Schmid's other UCLA players believers. They also
helped many climb to the next level.
</P>
<P>
   Caligiuri, now one of Schmid's players on the Galaxy, still
remembers UCLA's 1985 national championship, which took an
NCAA-record eight overtimes to win. Caligiuri said he marveled at
the way Schmid had the Bruins prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had a feeling when you stepped on the field you were
better than those other guys,'' Caligiuri said. ``And during the
course of the game, you never had the sense of fear that you could
lose.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because losing drives Schmid crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate losing,'' said Schmid, who was 322-63-33 and won three
national championships at UCLA. ``People always ask what motivates
me . . . it's losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine coaching a team that is .500. I coached one
team in my life -- a junior varsity soccer team -- that was below
.500.'' he said. ``Ever since, I've never had a team that didn't
win at least 65 percent of their games -- I would have trouble
accepting that.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmid still has trouble accepting any loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other night, when we lost to Dallas, was very tough on
me,'' said Schmid, recalling the Galaxy's 3-2 loss after they
squandered a 2-0 second-half lead in the team's next-to-last,
regular-season match. ``I was telling my girlfriend that now is not
a good night to come over.
</P>
<P>
   ``What got me through the night was looking forward to the next
day. Losing just refocuses me and gets me honed in on not let it
happening again.''
</P>
<P>
   There was one time when Schmid was at UCLA when the Bruins lost
three consecutive during a tournament in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked into the locker room and said we will not lose four
in a row,'' Schmid said. ``I said, if we lose four in a row, I'll
quit. We ended up winning, 1-0, and went to the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   That willingness and confidence, more than anything, are what
Schmid, 46, brought to the Galaxy when he took the reins from
Octavio Zambrano on April 22.
</P>
<P>
   Schmid turned down the Galaxy job in 1996, and said no to Kansas
City and San Jose for roughly the same reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be candid, the offers were there, but financially, it made
no sense to give up what I had for a situation in the MLS,'' Schmid
said.
</P>
<P>
   But with the urging of new billionaire owner Philip F. Anschutz
and Galaxy president Tim Leiweke, Schmid was finally convinced that
this was the right time to leave UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   And what he has done is take a group of whiners with inflated
egos and turn them into a disciplined platoon.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, the Galaxy overcame its poor start and reeled in
Colorado, Chicago and Dallas to finish 17-9 under Schmid and
capture the Western Conference title.
</P>
<P>
   But Schmid admits this is where the real test begins. The Galaxy
opens its first-round, best-of-three playoff series with Colorado
at 4:30 p.m. today at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Before the NCAA playoffs at UCLA, Schmid would often put his
team in hotels the night before a big match. Some nights, he would
have his captain pick a movie and the entire team would go see it.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Schmid took the Galaxy to San Diego for a
three-day mini-camp. Aside from training, the team had group
discussions. Some players spent mornings by the beach, others
played cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was relaxing,'' Schmid said. ``But, most of all, it was
setting a tone that this is the second phase. During the season,
when we travel, we don't get a lot of quality time together. This
was our opportunity to really get together, especially people who
don't ordinarily share their time with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   It had an impact on defender Danny Pena.
</P>
<P>
   ``In (Schmid's) eyes, I think this was more of a concentration
camp,'' a smiling Pena said. ``But without a doubt, the team became
even closer than we had been in the past. We all had a good time
together when we were with ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect what Sigi's trying to do. He's trying to prepare us
in every way possible to give us an advantage in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   That's just one way Schmid has molded a group that had problems
communicating under Zambrano.
</P>
<P>
   ``With players, there is nothing you can really say or do,''
Schmid said. ``Because the only thing they are really going to
respond to is starting or not starting. The ultimate rewards are
hollow, in that regard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is not to promise players something
you can't deliver. Do not raise expectations unrealistically
because they will do it on their own. You have to be up front. They
might not agree, but you have to make sure they understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmid understands the importance of winning a championship, but
won't let the fear of losing his job or anything else interfere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I worry about not making it to the finals? No,'' Schmid
said. ``Pressure to me is not pressure. Pressure is the challenges
you are willing to accept.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have enough confidence in our team that we can get there.
But if you keep pressuring everyone and say you have to get there,
then all it becomes is a burden. We all want the same thing, that's
the easy part.''

SOUTHLAND FOOTBALL FALLS APART
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to football, Los Angeles has the same title as one
of the TV season's new shows: Wasteland.
</P>
<P>
   It's bad enough that L.A. is disenfranchised when it comes to
the NFL. Now we're watching both of our usually prominent college
football teams stumble over their cleats.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday at the Rose Bowl, UCLA fans had nothing to cheer while
watching the Bruins suffer their first shutout since September of
1994, 17-0 against Cal. Indeed, the lone hooray of the day came
when the public address system blared the message that Notre Dame
beat USC, 25-24.
</P>
<P>
   This state of affairs doesn't inspire anyone to buy tickets for
the USC-UCLA game Nov. 20. With the Trojans at 3-3 and Bruins at
3-4, the chances are both teams will go bowl-less this holiday
season. That odd parlay has only hit once since 1980 (in 1996), and
both teams were on probation back in '80
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's performance Saturday was the ugliest of the Bob Toledo
era. This wasn't a ranked team shutting down the Bruin offense,
just one of the many Pac-10 also-rans in a year being called one of
the Pac-10's worst.
</P>
<P>
   The stats were bloody. The Bruins netted 168 yards, their lowest
since a loss to Arizona State in 1992. Of their 55 plays, the
Bruins threw 20 incomplete passes, two intercepted passes, and had
nine running plays result in a loss. The running backs as a group
netted 20 yards in 15 rushes.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' best play was Cory Paus ducking Cal's pass rush and
running for his life. The Bruin offense went three and out in six
of seven possessions in the first half, and the one exception
featured a 27-yard Paus scramble. Paus also had a 31-yard scramble
on the Bruins' longest, and last, drive of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kicked our fannies,'' said Toledo. ``We played as poorly
on offense since I've been here. We couldn't make a first down,
much less score. We couldn't run, Cory struggled early, and he got
rattled and couldn't hit his passes. He's going through some
growing pains.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating,'' said Paus, who threw for 332 yards
against Oregon a week ago. ``I didn't have a lot of time, and when
I did, I couldn't hit my passes. After every (three and out)
series, I kept thinking things had to get better. It just created
more urgency to get a first down, and they just weren't coming.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins began the season with some left over glow from the
Cade McNown era, but perhaps things were fated to go like this.
Most of McNown's linemen left with him. Receivers Danny Farmer,
Freddie Mitchell and Brian Poli-Dixon have been hurt, with the
latter now gone for the season. Plus, tailback DeShaun Foster has
been suffering from injuries and what looks like the sophomore
jinx.
</P>
<P>
   The defense returned six seniors and many starters, but that
wasn't necessarily a good thing considering last year's origami
defense. Add the poison of the handicapped parking saga and you
have all of the dynamics of a 3-4 season.
</P>
<P>
   The priority for Toledo and the Bruins is to find as many
positives as possible the balance of the season, and not let any
bitterness linger in the locker room. The Bruins almost got through
a chaotic '98 season before the Miami and Wisconsin debacles sent
some offense versus defense disagreements to the fore.
</P>
<P>
   Things can spin out of control much faster when you're losing
games you should win.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo, for example, said he will handle his quarterback Paus
``delicately.'' Paus, who had his moments against Oregon and
Arizona State, was throwing air balls all afternoon, and by the
fourth quarter he appeared to be bailing on his pass options and
hitting the road prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very fragile right now,'' said Toledo. ``I don't want
this to destroy him. This is part of the learning process. We
couldn't run the ball, and the defense teed off on him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruin defense had every reason to be frustrated. It was on
the field for 38 of the game's 60 minutes, and as games go in the
defenseless Bruin era (1996-99) 20 points or more allowed now in 31
of their last 42 games, including six games of 40-plus the unit
played better than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``When things don't go your way, you can't point fingers,'' said
Bruin defensive end Kenyon Coleman. ``If you do, you usually get
three more fingers pointed back at you. Win or lose, we do it
together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we were out there for a long time today,'' said safety
Eric Whitfield. ``But we can't live off saying we stopped Cal most
of the time. We made some mistakes out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Four large ones, in fact, that led to all of the Bears' points.
The defense blew zone coverage on Kyle Boller's 26-yard TD pass in
the first quarter after a Bruin turnover. After Cal took four
five-yard penalties on an early fourth quarter drive, the defense
gave up a 39-yard pass on a second-and-26 and then a 33-yard TD run
up the gut by Saleem Muhammad on third-and-25 situation.
</P>
<P>
   Needing the ball back quickly, the Bruin defense then allowed
Cal's butterball fullback Joshua White to break a third-and-one
plunge for 62 yards, setting up Cal's final points on a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still a young team,'' said Toledo. ``But there comes a
point where you've got to do something about it.'' No. One can't
always depend on USC scores.

BOLLER SHINES FOR CAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kyle Boller's dream came to fruition albeit with a twist on
Saturday when he stepped onto the grass at the Rose Bowl to
quarterback a college football team.
</P>
<P>
   The team he was quarterbacking was wearing a darker hue of blue
than the powder blue that his childhood favorite UCLA wears. But
Boller, who was one of three Southern California quarterbacks on
last season's Best in the West team while at Newhall's Hart High,
said he's happy California became the team of his dreams when UCLA
chose to sign J.P Losman.
</P>
<P>
   However, the dream couldn't have had the beginning that reality
threw at Boller on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   With a crowd of 55,559 looking on, more than 100 who were
friends and family members, Boller took his first snap against the
Bruins, rolled right and whistled the ball down the field into the
arms of UCLA defensive back Eric Whitfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was weird opening up with a pick,'' chuckled the 6-foot-4,
200-pound Boller, who had three interceptions in 454 attempts as a
prep senior. ``That's not the way I visualized it.''
</P>
<P>
   While we're on the subject of visualization, he probably also
didn't see two more interceptions, two sacks, eight offensive
penalties for 40 yards and several pass attempts that looked like
they were thrown by an 18-year-old true freshman playing in his
sixth collegiate game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was times that he didn't look sterling,'' Cal coach Tom
Holmoe said after his team came into Pasadena and stunned the
Bruins, 17-0. ``But he did look like the starting quarterback of a
team that won 17-0.''
</P>
<P>
   The final numbers 9 of 20 for 113 yards were far from sterling,
but there were a few times when it was easy to see why he received
eight votes from the 10 Best in the West voters.
</P>
<P>
   Boller stood calmly in the pocket in the first quarter and found
fellow freshman Joseph Echema for a 27-yard touchdown and a 7-0
lead. And it was Boller who calmly connected with Sean Currin on a
39-yard pass on second-and-26 with just over 11 minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   But it also was Boller who chased down an errant shotgun snap
three plays after the completion to Currin and blindly threw the
ball toward the end zone in the area of two Bruin defenders. Cal
receiver Ronnie Davenport prevented an interception, but was called
for pass interference on the play.
</P>
<P>
   It also was Boller who calmly made sure his socks looked good at
the same time the 25-second clock was winding down to zero.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a young kid,'' Holmoe said. ``What can you say? On one
hand, you want to spank him. On the other hand, you want to kiss
him. Fortunately, we ended up kissing him at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmoe, who is a father of four, has plenty of experience
disciplining kids - both at home and on the job. Probably no team
in the Pac-10 has as many true freshman playing significant minutes
than the eight the Bears played on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Contributing freshmen included Hawthorne graduate Echema
catching four passes for 44 yards, Joe Igber darting for a
team-high 113 yards on 20 carries, and Scott Tercero, a 6-5,
280-pound Loyola graduate, playing every snap at left guard.
</P>
<P>
   It also included Daniel Nwangwu filling in at defensive tackle,
Atari Callen taking some snaps at defensive back and Narbonne
graduate Nnamdi Asomugha, Cameron Bunce and Calvin Hosey playing
special teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down the road,'' Boller said, ``this will be an awesome group.
Once everybody gets on the same page, we could be very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Igber is really good right now. The 5-8, 190-pound fireplug from
Honolulu ran for 35 yards on his first touch in the opener against
Rutgers and celebrated his first start last week by rushing for 116
yards on 18 carries in a loss to BYU.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't sure if I was ready when the coaches asked me to
contribute,'' Igber said. ``Once I gave it a shot, I came to the
realization I could help. I don't know if it's conscious,
subconscious or unconscious, I just do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting classes are a funny thing. Boller was widely
recruited, but Echema and Igber weren't. And Cal's incoming
freshman crop was thought to be behind UCLA and USC, and possibly
behind a few other Pac-10 schools. Holmoe immediately put this
group on the field because of necessity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're playing because they deserve to play,'' Holmoe said.
</P>
<P>
   Only time will give a true indication on which school inked the
best freshman class. But, at least for now, Holmoe's crop is paying
dividends and he wanted to make sure future prospects in Southern
California noticed his team Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognized that,'' Holmoe said when told there were plenty
of potential recruits watching on Saturday. ``It's always important
to come down to L.A. and play well. This is a big recruiting base
for us.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON - For more than a decade, there has been a pile of
evidence mounting against Roger Clemens, most of it kept very
hush-hush by baseball people. Now the whole world knows.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens is as fine a regular-season pitcher as there is, but
those are the months occupied from April to September. In October,
when true big-game reputations are made, Clemens has been nowhere
to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   His performance in Game 3 of the American League Championship
Series on Saturday further perpetuates Clemens' inability to answer
the bell when it matters most.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse for the suddenly stunned New York Yankees
was the humiliating final score: Boston 13, New York 1. With Boston
winning its first game of the series behind all-planet pitcher
Pedro Martinez, the best-of-seven series is no longer a rout.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, pitching with strained muscles in his back, was able
to shut down the mighty Yankees offense with what he described as
``nothing.'' It was a brilliant performance from the best pitcher
in the game at this moment.
</P>
<P>
   But the focus of this game was on the best pitcher of
yesteryear, Clemens, who mowed through opponents for 13 seasons in
Boston before bolting town three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens' second pitch of the late afternoon slammed off the base
of the right-field fence. His seventh pitch sailed over the Green
Monster and into the net in left-center field. By the time he had
faced his 15th and final batter, Clemens had given up six hits and
needed 61 pitches to record the six outs he managed to get.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how much he insisted this was exactly like any other
game, the truth is this was nothing like any other game Clemens has
pitched in.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander dearly wanted to return to Fenway Park and
massacre his former club. Instead, the Red Sox strangled him,
embarrassing the five-time Cy Young Award winner to a point where
bringing up his postseason failures is now a completely valid
topic.
</P>
<P>
   On a nearly flawless New England evening, Clemens wilted under
the intense pressure that only Fenway Park can bring. The Fenway
Faithful were out in full force, ready to add that incessant
chanting to help distract their once-favorite son.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment Clemens took the long jog from the visitors
third-base dugout to the right field bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raw-ger! Raw-ger! Raw-ger!'' they sing-songed as Clemens
warmed up before the game. It only got worse once the Red Sox
started wrapping him like a 50-year-old batting practice pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   One particular Red Sox fan walked around holding up a T-shirt
that read, ``Hey Roger, would you leave your wife if another woman
offered you more?''
</P>
<P>
   These fans, arguably the most loyal in the game, remain stung by
Clemens' departure after the 1996 season, taking Toronto's
four-year $31.5 million offer and spurning Boston's four-year offer
worth $24 million.
</P>
<P>
   That was bad enough for these fans. But when Clemens came out
and said he thought he had a better chance to reach the World
Series with the Blue Jays than with Boston, well, that let all of
New England know they could now officially turn on Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   The once-glorious relationship Clemens enjoyed with New
Englanders was forever damaged beyond repair. If that weren't bad
enough, Clemens then basically orchestrated his trade from Toronto
to the fiercely hated New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   With Clemens wearing enemy pinstripes, war was officially
declared, which may have been appropriate since many here think
Clemens is nothing more than a mercenary, willing to sell his
services to the highest bidder and forgoing the strong allegiances
that had been built up.
</P>
<P>
   The Rocket was yanked from the game after retiring just six
batters. He left trailing, 4-0, but wound up being tagged for a
fifth run when reliever Hideki Irabu (whom Clemens repeatedly
referred to as ``High-deki'' during his post-game press conference)
served up the game's second home run with one of Clemens' runners
aboard.
</P>
<P>
   It was sweet revenge for this community, one that considers Red
Sox baseball on par with the most fervent religion. They don't play
around in these parts, not when it comes to the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Both of Boston's local newspapers led their baseball playoff
sections with stories highlighting Clemens' playoff failures.
Clemens' two playoff wins have occurred 13 years apart and each
time against a brain-dead opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens' first playoff win came in Game 7 of the 1986 ALCS
against California. While that may sound like it was a big-time
victory, remember the Angels were one strike away from reaching the
World Series in Game 5 before Boston's Dave Henderson's game-tying
home run in the ninth led to an extra-inning win. In addition, the
Angels, who never recovered, had fallen behind, 7-0, after four
innings in Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens' other postseason victory occurred last week when he
blanked a spooked Texas Rangers club, pitching seven scoreless
innings in a 3-0 victory in Game 3 of a three-game sweep.
</P>
<P>
   In neither game did the opponent put up much of a fight. Clemens
earned some points for being a stand-up guy in the post-game press
conference. But there was no denying all came in garbage time.
</P>
<P>
   As early evening took effect over New England and the Old Towne
team was about to wrap up its 13-1 victory, the crowd began mocking
the ``Let's Go Yankees'' chant with ``Where is Roger?''
</P>
<P>
   The way the pitching rotations are set up in this series, a
possible Game 7 would again match Clemens against Martinez at
Yankee Stadium. The Yankees better hope they can put away the Red
Sox before then.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Clemens' armor could forever be pierced. &QL;

 &HT;    A guide to family reunions
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In every family, requisite events such as
weddings and bar mitzvahs provide ample opportunities to get
together. Oftentimes, however, attendance at these happy milestones
wanes, giving way to attendance at a spate of funerals. (Some of my
relatives are recognizable only when sitting in a folding chair and
wearing black.)
</P>
<P>
   Family reunions muster the clan on neutral territory sans a
scripted occasion _ such a relief. While there is no escaping
familiar tensions, reunions are less structured than other events
(no mother of the bride, no godfather, no dyed-to-match shoes).
Family reunions are a chance to catch up on news, swap a few lies,
gawk at recent additions and celebrate a sense of, well, family _
magically bringing annual holiday photographs to life.
</P>
<P>
   Varied as the families themselves, these gatherings may be
simple potluck suppers or weeklong, activity-packed occasions
featuring day trips, water skiing and talent shows.
</P>
<P>
   Gather around the fried chicken and potato salad, it's time to
plan your next family reunion with some help from the Greig Files.
</P>
<P>
   WHEN DOES A GATHERING URGE OCCUR?
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually when children appear,'' says Myra Quick, continuing
education program developer at the University of Memphis, who
teaches a course in family reunions, ``because there is something
in us that wants to know more about where we come from.''
</P>
<P>
   The reunion urge may be sparked by a milestone birthday of a
senior family member, a medical necessity or an interest in
genealogy. Being a part of something larger than yourself is
curiously satisfying
</P>
<P>
   OH, MY GOODNESS, WHERE TO START?
</P>
<P>
   With a location and a list.
</P>
<P>
   How about the holiday card list _ or any list for that matter _
and a few stalwart relatives. If this is the first family reunion
of your kin, you are in luck. There is nothing to compare it with,
so it is destined to be a success. Planning the gathering is a
chance to celebrate a family's talents. For example, cousin Fred,
author of that ghastly, gushy December news epistle, would make a
trustworthy family correspondent. (Aren't you sorry you laughed at
his last effort?)
</P>
<P>
   Tom Ninkovich's ``Family Reunion Handbook'' covers all the bases
(and some of the outfield). Pick up a copy at a local bookstore.
Many of Ninkovich's tips are also on the Web at
www.reuniontips.com.
</P>
<P>
   Some families even develop a Web site for planning and comments.
The Hoelscher-Buxkemper family of Austin, which gets together in
even-numbered years, has a site that includes a page on lost
relatives. See hostville.com/hoelscher for ideas on your own family
Web page.
</P>
<P>
   HOW BIG CAN THESE GATHERINGS GET?
</P>
<P>
   Big. Reunions are inclusive. Invite in-laws and outlaws.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the list seems monstrous, take heart. No way to
``out-reunion'' the historic Busse family. In 1998 this clan
gathered to celebrate 150 years. More than2,400 members descended
on Grayslake, Ill., and, in addition to making memories, made it
into the Guinness Book of World Records. Busse clan members live
everywhere, Texas to Taiwan to Turkey. Descendants of each of the
original six family lines sported color-coded T-shirts at the
reunion.
</P>
<P>
   DOES THIS HAVE TO RIVAL A ROYAL WEDDING?
</P>
<P>
   Of course not. It is a reunion, not a reception. A simple supper
will do. Members who participate in event planning and execution
automatically buy into its success. Let others contribute and
participate. Shredding cole slaw for 60 is a bonding experience.
</P>
<P>
   If family members are traveling a distance to get together
(committing dollars and time), consider a multiday event. The
University of Memphis' reunion guru, Myra Quick, says every age
group should have activities _ gin rummy to golf, swimming to
charades.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT GOES ON AT THESE REUNIONS?
</P>
<P>
   Other than staring at each other and wondering just how
recessive the weirdo gene is? You name it. Reunions can have talent
shows and religious services, skits and genealogy lessons, costume
banquets and three-legged races, photo taking and photo swapping.
</P>
<P>
   Children love to play with cousins, adults enjoy a relaxed visit
and teens circle each other and act cool. Between the ogling and
cooking, family members learn a lot about each other. Reunions are
particularly enlightening to those who marry into a family.
Activities often become the identifier of the reunions (the year
Jimmy brought his second wife named Mitzy, the year cousin Eddie
first donned a toupee and became ``Eddie the rug,'' etc.)
</P>
<P>
   WHEN IS THE REUNION A SUCCESS? When the family leaves,
trumpeting, ``When is the next reunion?'' advises reunion teacher
Quick. Ignore the naysayers. Better yet, crown these negatrons the
next reunion chairperson. Likely suspects? The
well-it-seems-to-me-ers who second-guess every decision.
</P>
<P>
   REUNION COMMANDMENTS
</P>
<P>
   _ Start early _ a year in advance is almost too late.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lock in a date and a site.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do not try to accommodate everyone. It can't be done.
</P>
<P>
   _ Form a committee of two to three dependable relatives to act
as decision-makers and a clearinghouse for information.
</P>
<P>
   _ Assign jobs/draft volunteers. Bare-bones jobs include address
keeper, correspondent, registration, projects chairperson, food
coordinator, social director (for adults, kids and teens),
photographer, set-up, name tags, gifts, prizes, finances, updates
and newsletters, and cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make list/send invitations with as much detail and lead time
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make costs clear to everyone so there are no surprises at
registration.
</P>
<P>
   _ Get money upfront (these are relatives, after all).
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep family informed of changes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Follow up periodically with those who have taken on jobs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Announce plans for the next reunion before everyone departs.

   CLINTON-AGENDA _ WASHINGTON _ After accusing his Republican foes
on Capitol Hill of turning their backs on the rest of the world,
undermining the national economy and attacking the nation's
teachers, police, environment and the poor, President Clinton
suddenly shifted gears. ``I want to work with Congress,'' Clinton
said Thursday, standing beneath the crystal East Room chandeliers
during an hourlong White House press conference. ``We can put an
end to reckless partisanship, to gimmicks and gamesmanship.''

   CONGRESS-DEMS _ Mike Taylor's phone rang soon after he barely
lost his first race for Congress last year. Democratic leaders, who
had ignored his campaign in North Carolina's 8th district, had an
urgent message: Please run for Congress. Taylor is the kind of
candidate upon whom Democrats are relying to make up 5 seats and
give them control of the House in 2000. We look at what's at stake
in the close race for control of the House. (Sherman, Atlanta

   E-COMMERCE _ WASHINGTON _ Electronic commerce is likely to grow
tremendously during this year's holiday shopping season, but that
growth may painfully spotlight the problems that still face
consumers shopping on the Web. The problems include the
availability of merchandise, security and convenience of home
deliveries, procedures for returning merchandise, and the possible
loss of significant tax revenue to states and cities.

   JAMAICA-HIGHTECH _ MONTEGO BAY, Jamaica _ Sun, sand and ...
software? Already known as one of the Caribbean's top resorts,
Jamaica's glittering Montego Bay is now home to an educational
program aimed at churning out software engineers. INDUSA, an
Atlanta-based company, and Furman University of Greenville, S.C.
have teamed up to create the Caribbean Institute of Technology,
which will turn out its first crop of software technicians in
December. The innovative program is aimed at stopping Jamaica's
brain-drain and weaning the country away from its tourism-based
economy, while providing badly-needed software engineers for the
booming high-tech field. (Williams, Cox News Service). 30. WITH

States in mobile communications and is catching up in computers and

   SCHOOLPRAYER _ On Tuesday, Oct. 19, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals hears what legal experts call a highly important school
prayer case out of Jacksonville. School prayer in this case
involves graduation ceremonies in which the senior class elects
representatives to give ``messages'' at the commencement exercises.
But prayer is often the message and a lawsuit claims that the
establishment clause should not be thrown out by majority rule. The
full 12-member court sits to hear the case; it already vacated a
3-judge panel's opinion that found the practise unconstitutional.

   RAMSEY-WRAP _ ATLANTA _ Will justice ever come in the killing of
JonBenet Ramsey? After a three-year investigation that cost $2
million and a 13-month grand jury probe that came up empty-handed,
is there even hope? As with everything else in the JonBenet
mystery, opinions differ, and some experts insist bringing the
little girl's killer to punishment remains a long shot.

Service for AMs of Monday, Oct. 18:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   AFGHAN-MASSACRE (Bazarak, Afghanistan) _ Afghanistan's ruling
Taliban militia, along with thousands of Pakistanis lit with the
fervor of jihad, went on a destructive spree this summer. By Barry
Bearak. (With a map.)
</P>
<P>
   JERUSALEM-ARABS (Jerusalem) _ Israel has liberalized its rules
under which Arabs living in Jerusalem often were forced out of the
city. By Joel Greenberg.
</P>
<P>
   PAKISTAN-RDP (Islamabad, Pakistan) _ The leader of the country's
latest military coup speaks, to give his vision of the path
Pakistan will take under his leadership. By Tim Weiner and Steve
LeVine.
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-POLITICS (Jakarta, Indonesia) _ Developments as the
presidential campaign heats up. Megawati Sukarnoputri, the
opposition leader, is expected to win, but she has stumbled; if she
does not prevail in Wednesday's national assembly vote, the country
could be thrown into chaos. By Seth Mydans,
</P>
<P>
   KYRGYZSTAN-ISLAM (Osh, Kyrgyzstan) _ Ever since five new nations
emerged in Central Asia from the ruins of the Soviet Union, there
have been warnings that the region was ripe for Islamic
insurrection and insurgency. This summer, just such an insurgency
erupted in Kyrgyzstan, the smallest and most democratic country in
the region. By Stephen Kinzer. (With a map.)
</P>
<P>
   MONTENEGRO-INDEPENDENCE (Cetinje, Yugoslavia) _ With its economy
spinning toward disaster, tiny Montenegro is close to taking one
more formal step toward independence from Slobodan Milosevic's
Yugoslavia: the establishment of its own currency. By Steven
Erlanger. (With a map.)
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-PEPSI-CAPITALIST (Moscow) _ Donald M. Kendall, the
American who arguably brought capitalism to Russia 40 years ago,
came back for a visit to reports of bribery and money-laundering,
to Mercedesful of impeccably suited thugs, to political wars raging
among the lap-dog newspapers and television networks of too-wealthy
tycoons, to the throngs of street urchins and dumpster-miners. All
in all, he said, it could have been worse. By Michael Wines.
</P>
<P>
   TENTATIVE: The following story may not appear tonight.)
</P>
<P>
   JAMAICA-POLITICS (Kingston, Jamaica) _ The killing of a
successful businesswoman and former cabinet member has set off a
wave of confessions: not by sullen-faced killers, but by Jamaican
politicians who have apologized for creating a culture that
encouraged violence as a campaign tactic and self-interest as a
ruling tenet. By David Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ASTHMA _ This is the other inner-city epidemic: asthma. The
burden of AIDS on the poor and minorities has been well documented.
Asthma is less deadly; it claims about 5,000 lives in this country
each year, fewer than a third of those deaths attributed to AIDS.
Yet the death statistics do not begin to tell the story of how an
unprecedented _ and unexplained _ explosion in asthma cases is
suffocating the nation's poorest urban residents, especially
children. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg.
</P>
<P>
   CHICKEN-COUNTRY (Laurel, Del.) _ Six hundred million chickens a

leaving 600,000 tons of what the industry calls litter and what
residents call abomination. By Francis X. Clines. (With a map.)
</P>
<P>
   MISSILE-SILOS (Langdon, N.D.) _ Beneath the flat, broad plains
of North Dakota, where the push of a button could have ignited a
nuclear attack, the earth is exploding. It is the sound of peace.
In a thunderous exclamation point to the end of the Cold War, some
150 steel and concrete silos, once the launching tunnels of the
nuclear Minuteman III missiles, are being blown to bits by
dynamite. By Dirk Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   MURDER-DECLINE _ In the clearest evidence yet that recent
efforts to reduce gun violence by new laws and police pressure are
working, a Federal Bureau of Investigation report released Sunday
shows that a 7 percent drop in murders in 1998 was accounted for
entirely by a decrease in killings committed with guns. By Fox
Butterfield.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POLITICS &LR;  (Moving in ``p'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-MINORITIES (Seattle) _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush's outreach
to minorities _ the visual complement to his oratorical slogan of
compassionate conservatism _ is his most powerful signal to swing
voters that he is not an extremist, that he occupies enough
territory near the center of the political spectrum to warrant
their allegiance. By Frank Bruni.

IT'S DEMONS VS. ANGELS IN PC GAME WITH RELIGIOUS THEME 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last time Robert Westmoreland promoted a new computer-game
concept, the industry first laughed but then chased him, after his
idea proved a huge winner. And starting Monday, he hopes that
history repeats itself _ the Lord and the marketplace willing.
</P>
<P>
   The fresh gaming idea he is pushing now? Christian action games.
And his company's first entry, The War in Heaven, is being shipped
to stores this week. Whether this Doom-meets-the-Bible game will be
a success is anybody's guess. Yet the 32-year-old Westmoreland has
a track record as someone with an instinct for popular tastes in a
game market that is broadening beyond its technophile roots _ a
byproduct of the spread of personal computers into more and more
American households thanks to fast-falling PC prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may sicken traditional gamers, but my gut feel is that this
game will be a hit,'' said Ann Stephens, president of PC Data Inc.,
a research firm which tracks the $1.5 billion-a-year PC game
market. ``Besides, it sounds a lot more interesting than the last
idea he championed.''
</P>
<P>
   Westmoreland's last unconventional stance came a few years ago
when, as the computer software buyer for Wal-Mart Stores Inc., he
prodded the industry to make budget-priced hunting games. At first,
his suggestion met bemused derision. But one adventurous
computer-game publisher listened, and the result was Deer Hunter, a
surprise best seller, prompting a flurry of hunting games and even
a spoof title, Deer Avenger, in which the buck stalks the hunter.
</P>
<P>
   So next comes the Christian action game. The War in Heaven is
published by Valusoft, which Westmoreland joined in September,
after leaving Wal-Mart, as part-owner and executive vice president
of marketing and development.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, software with a Christian theme has tended to be
staid and didactic, mainly Bibles and children's games that quiz
players on their Bible knowledge. What qualified as a big-budget,
entertainment product in the Christian niche was ``Charlton
Heston's Voyage Through the Bible,'' a CD-ROM released in 1995,
with readings by Heston and video clips of the Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
   By the standards of the genre, The War in Heaven is a striking
departure. In the action game, intended for Christian males 15 and
older, a player is confronted with snarling monsters, with horns
and wings, wielding swords and other lethal weapons. That is the
challenge if the player chooses ``the Divine Path of Obedience,''
becomes a good angel and progresses up the game's 12-step ascent to
heaven. Yet a player can also choose ``the Fallen Path of Power and
follow Lucifer,'' become a demon and fight against shapely blondes
with feathery wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you mention that it's a Christian game, people assume
there's no violence,'' Westmoreland observed. ``Sure, there's
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he notes, there are no gushers of blood and gore, so
frequent in games rated for adults only. The War in Heaven is rated
``T'' by the Entertainment Software Rating Board, which means it is
recommended as suitable for people 13 and older.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the game reaches store shelves, its playful approach
to religious instruction has raised eyebrows in the Christian
community and elicited qualms from some retail chains. But the two
young men who created The War In Heaven _ Theodore Beale and Andrew
Lunstad, cofounders of the software design firm Eternal Warriors _
say that they have merely tried to create a Christian game that
might appeal to a broad audience among computer gamers reared on
the likes of Doom and Diablo.
</P>
<P>
   The violence, they add, is a role-playing depiction of
``spiritual warfare,'' a concept that has made some inroads into
mainstream theology. Spiritual warfare, theologians explain, is the
notion that nonphysical agents of good and evil are constantly at
war and that their behavior affects people on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Valusoft does publish some irreverent games, like Lawyer Hunt,
but the company insists The War in Heaven is not among them. And
both of the game's creators are devout Christians who say there
should be no contradiction in having fun on a computer game and
learning spiritual truths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, this is a spooky thing to be attempting in some
ways,'' said Lunstad, 30, who was the chief programmer for the
game. ``And let's face it, when you have angels fighting demons, it
is going to be controversial.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he added, ``I truly feel that God called me to do
this.''
</P>
<P>
   To explain the instructional side of the game, Lunstad said that
if a person chooses to play as a demon, he progresses by disobeying
the Bible. ``But as you progress down the evil path, you have to do
things that are more and more distasteful, from blasphemy to
striking a praying angel,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Without giving away the game, Lunstad noted that the evil path
leads to self-destruction. ``And Theo and I really believe that to
be true,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Boyd, a theology professor at Bethel College, finds the
new computer game impressive. A scholar with graduate degrees from
the Yale Divinity School and the Princeton Theological Seminary,
Boyd is the author of ``God At War: The Bible and Spiritual
Conflict'' (Intervarsity Press, 1997), which made the case for
spiritual warfare being a serious theological concept.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd also has a 14-year-old son, Nathan, who has played a test
version of The War in Heaven. ``He loved it,'' Boyd said. ``He
compared it to Doom, except with a spiritual twist.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The early reaction from Christian groups seems to be guarded,
though not antagonistic. ``Our concern would be if this game mocked
people of faith in any way,'' said Mike Russell, a spokesman for
the Christian Coalition. ``It doesn't sound as if it does, though
it does seem to take a pretty unique approach to religious
education.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the big retail chains are apparently taking a
wait-and-see stance toward the game, aware that customers can be
unpredictably sensitive about products with religious themes. Wim
Stocks, a senior vice president at GT Interactive, the distributor
for The War in Heaven, said last week that many major chains had
agreed to distribute the game, but several were sitting on the
fence. ``Some of the chains are nervous,'' said Stocks, who
declined to name the retailers carrying the game or those balking.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Priced at $19.95, less than half the price of traditional adult
PC games, The War in Heaven meets the industry definition of a
budget game _ a fast-growing slice of the market, built largely on
sales at big discount chains like Wal-mart, Target and Kmart.
</P>
<P>
   Pocketbooks, a division of Viacom's Simon &AMP; Schuster book
publishing subsidiary, is betting on The War in Heaven. It is
publishing a mass-market paperback novel by the same title, written
by Beale, next spring. ``It's a good fantasy story, though
definitely one with a different take than most science fiction,''
said Scott Shannon, director of science fiction for Pocketbooks.
``And I thought it would be highly marketable.''
</P>
<P>
   If the game is successful, Westmoreland of Valusoft predicts
that Christian action games could become sizable segment of the PC
game business. ``There is plenty of source material,'' he observed.
``You need look no further than the Bible for battles.''

TAX RETURNS OF CHARITIES TO BE POSTED ON THE WEB
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Va., Md., Wash., Minn., Calif.)  (nk) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The detailed tax returns that charities file annually with the
federal government are to be posted on the Internet beginning
Monday, giving quick and easy access for the first time to
comprehensive details on how charities use their money.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is, by far, the most important development ever in making
charities accountable and making their finances transparent,'' said
Virginia Hodgkinson, a founder of the National Center for
Charitable Statistics in Washington, who spent two decades in an
often lonely quest to make financial data on charities widely
available.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of exposing charity finances to widespread scrutiny is
being financed by charities themselves _ notably the Ford, Kellogg,
Mellon foundations _ and the Web site is operated by another
charity, Philanthropic Research Inc., of Williamsburg, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The scrutiny of all charities, these organizations say, will
ultimately bring major changes to the financial practices of the
$700 billion charitable world, just as increased public access to
financial data of publicly traded companies has transformed the
business world.
</P>
<P>
   Donors will be able to quickly compare the Cancer Research
Institute in New York, which spends 91 percent of its revenues on
research, with the Walker Cancer Research Institute of Aberdeen,
Md., which spends 83 percent on fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on the verge of a whole new era of nonprofit
accountability,'' said Arthur W. Schmidt Jr., president of
Philanthropic Research, the charity that is posting the so-called
information returns, Form 990's, on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 990 will move rapidly from being this obscure, obnoxious
reporting document to something informative and acceptable, and
transform itself into a useful document,'' Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   For a half-century, all charities, which fall under Section
501(c)(3) of the tax code, as well as most other nonprofit
organizations, like trade associations, have been required to file
990's with the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   The returns include detailed information, such as how much of
the money taken in goes directly to charitable services and how
much to pay individual top officers, directors and consultants. But
few people, even among nonprofit executives, were aware that the
990's are public records. Often, the only way to get copies of
returns was from the IRS, which typically involved delays of up to
six months.
</P>
<P>
   A small industry of charity watchdogs has long used the 990's
and other documents to rate the performance of charities for
donors, though only a narrow segment of the charity world was ever
scrutinized.
</P>
<P>
   Since June, Congress has required all charities to make their
990 returns readily available. The law, however, has been widely
ignored by charities, many of which delay, claim ignorance or just
refuse to comply, according to tests conducted this year by
students at Baruch College in New York, Evergreen State University
in Seattle and other schools.
</P>
<P>
   Now anyone with Internet access can examine these returns.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Williams, the IRS official in charge of the project, said:
``Right from day one we thought it was an excellent idea. Congress
wants the 990's open to the sunshine, and wants them available as
quickly and easily as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the simple pie charts that charities often include in
solicitations to show how they use gifts, these returns show how
much revenue came from donations, fees and government; they also
list the organization's debts and investments, and detail overhead
and fund-raising costs.
</P>
<P>
   The first 140,000 of the 220,000 or so returns are available
now, without charge, at www.guidestar.org, and the rest will be
posted before year-end. The most recent returns will be posted,
mostly for 1997 and 1998, though some dating to 1992 will be
included for charities that have not filed since then.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The site also provides a synopsis of each charity's finances and
an explanation of the Form 990.
</P>
<P>
   (Congress does not require 990 reports from several hundred
thousand other charities _ religious organizations, federally
chartered organizations like the Red Cross or groups with less than
$25,000 in annual revenues.)
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The site will soon include a data base with each of the hundreds
of individual facts on each Form 990, allowing computerized
comparisons of charities by type, size and location. Over the
years, as the data base grows, it will also allow examination of
long-term patterns.
</P>
<P>
   While anyone can view the reports, a minority of Americans
probably will, said Russy D. Sumariwalla, co-chair of the Aspen
Institute's Nonprofit Sector Research Fund. The site's main value,
he added, will be in the scrutiny that nonprofit executives will
apply to peers and competitors, which he said should result in more
efficient use of charity dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The Urban Institute, the Washington researcher that runs the
National Center for Charitable Statistics, is giving the IRS nearly
$1 million over five years to enable the agency to scan the 5
million or so pages of charity returns annually onto 400 CD-ROM's.
(By comparison, the entire Encyclopaedia Britannica easily fits on
just one.)
</P>
<P>
   The IRS needed the cash infusion to do the work because, after
years of budget cuts, some of its charity records were a shambles.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Ford, Rockefeller Brothers Fund and other foundations have
made grants to Philanthropic Research to have each line on every
Form 990 keypunched into a data base. Philanthropic Research must
raise $2 million a year to continue the data entry until the IRS
accepts electronically filed reports from the charities, now
scheduled for 2007.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, a handful of charities have followed the lead of the
California Community Foundation in Los Angeles in posting their own
990's on the Internet. In addition, a variety of Web sites run by
nonprofit specialists active in the cyber-accountability movement
have posted small collections of 990's, such as one devoted to AIDS
charities, and the attorneys general of California, Minnesota and
13 other states have begun posting 990's and similar reports by
charities in their states. But none of these efforts comes close in
scale or comprehensiveness to the Guidestar site.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hodgkinson, the charity statistics expert who laid the
groundwork for the Web site effort, said the increased access
should benefit donors and legitimate charities alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal was for the public to be able to get that information
in a minute because the more transparency charitable organizations
have the better,'' Mrs. Hodgkinson said, adding, ``and, I believe,
transparency will result in more contributions.''

`ANIMALS': A SCIENTIFIC SLEUTH IN PURSUIT OF ANIMAL MYSTERIES
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Publication notes at end of review.)

 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everyone has surely heard of dogs that somehow know when their
owners are coming home. In the typical case the pet goes to the
front door and waits as long as half an hour for the arrival of the
expected. When you hear such reports you think the dog must be
responding to a smell or a sound or a vibration or daily routine or
some subliminal cue from those present in the house. When you are
assured that none of these could be the case _ the routine varies;
the animal is sometimes alone; neither smell nor sound nor
vibration can transmit itself very far in the heart of a busy
metropolis or from a car with its windows closed _ you shrug and
disbelieve or pass the story off as inexplicable.
</P>
<P>
   Rupert Sheldrake, a biochemist and former research fellow at the
British Royal Society, has gathered hundreds of such reports of
mysterious behavior in his new book, ``Dogs That Know When Their
Owners Are Coming Home: And Other Unexplained Powers of Animals.''
They concern not only dogs, but also cats, parrots, horses,
monkeys, sheep, guinea pigs, rabbits, chickens _ chickens?! _ and
even humans.
</P>
<P>
   His stories involve not only pets anticipating arrivals, but
also a cat that knows when its master is telephoning (and then
knocks the receiver off the hook and meows into the mouthpiece),
animals that seem to know when they are nearing home, creatures
that apparently can warn of events like epileptic fits,
earthquakes, storms and air raids, and dozens of other cases of
uncanny behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover Sheldrake painstakingly sets about to refute all the
more obvious explanations. Aside from arguing persuasively that
none of the five senses could have been involved in many of these
events, he describes experiments with coordinated video cameras
seeming to show that the animals often responded to their owners'
decisions to leave for home. Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   What is Sheldrake's explanation for these incredible
occurrences? As he trained as a scientist at Cambridge University
and took a Ph.D. in biochemistry, he came to feel, he writes, ``a
great gulf ... open up between my own experience of animals and
plants and the scientific approach that I was being taught.''
</P>
<P>
   So after years of work in biochemistry and cell biology he
returned to the world of pets he knew as a child and developed the
theory that the social bonds between animals and between animals
and humans are ``not just metaphorical but real, literal
connections.'' These bonds, as he suggested in one of his previous
books, ``The Presence of the Past,'' are an example of a class of
fields called morphic fields, from the Greek word morphe, meaning
form.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morphic fields,'' he writes, ``hold together and coordinate
the parts of a system in space and time, and contain a memory from
previous similar systems.'' He continues, ``The process by which
this memory is transferred from past to present is called morphic
resonance, involving an influence of like upon like across space
and time,'' like ``iron filings in a magnetic field,'' and
communicating by a form of telepathy, meaning literally ``distant
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   For Sheldrake this morphic resonance accounts not only for how
dogs know when their owners are coming home, but also for how birds
flock, fish school, insects colonize, monarch butterflies migrate,
pigeons home, cats comfort old people and how a dog he knows about
sniffed and tried to bite off a lesion on his owner's leg that
turned out to be cancerous.
</P>
<P>
   Telepathy? Premonition, even? Are we really to believe this? Why
not, Sheldrake asks, if so much evidence abounds?
</P>
<P>
   A truly scientific outlook would entail trying to account for
this evidence instead of practicing what he calls ``compulsive
skepticism,'' as so many of his antagonists seem to do.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he adds, in the new reality that quantum physics has
revealed _ where, for instance, the observer is linked to the
observed, and where particles from a common source retain a
mysterious interconnection so that what happens to one is instantly
reflected in the other _ why shouldn't animals (and humans, too) be
in touch with a world where time flows forward and backward and
everything is interconnected?
</P>
<P>
   If Sheldrake gets you to wonder if there are more things in
heaven and earth than are dreamt of in Horatio's philosophy, wonder
is about all he evokes, as his text is somewhat labored and
repetitious. There aren't even many good animal tales, one dog
anticipation story being pretty much like the next. The best
anecdote concerns a bonobo, or pygmy chimpanzee, at Twycross Zoo in
Warwickshire, England, who was poking members of the public with a
long bamboo cane she had somehow got hold of. When her keeper
thought of getting it away from her by offering her one of the four
cakes she had bought for tea, the bonobo instantly snapped the cane
into four pieces, thinking to make a deal for all four cakes.
Whether the ape was being telepathic here or not, she was certainly
smart.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his book, Sheldrake urges his readers to carry out
their own experiments with their animals and send him the results.
In this spirit, I have been directing heavy thoughts to the older
of our two cats and what I want to know is, if he is as bonded to
us as he seems _ which could be described in Sheldrake's terms as
by morphic hoops of steel _ how come, despite all the disapproval
we have expressed, he still sharpens his claws on our ruined couch
whenever we are out of the room and never when we are present?
</P>
<P>
   So much for human-to-animal telepathy around our place.

 &HT;    GORE TO FOCUS EFFORTS ON NEW HAMPSHIRE
 &HT;    350&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Big Labor behind his campaign in other early
states, Vice President Al Gore is turning his attention to a
suddenly neck-and-neck New Hampshire primary race with former Sen.
Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is scheduled to travel Monday to Dover, N.H., to receive
the endorsement of the Granite State's popular Gov. Jeanne Shaheen.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first of three trips in the next two weeks the vice
president plans to make to New Hampshire, where his once formidable
lead over Bradley in opinion polls has evaporated. He plans to
spend seven full days in the state, culminating in his first
side-by-side appearance with Bradley on Oct. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the upcoming events are designed to get Gore closer to
voters, in hopes of establishing what he described last week in an
interview with The Washington Post as ``a very personal connection
and line of communication.''
</P>
<P>
   After securing the endorsement of the AFL-CIO labor federation
last week, Gore has the luxury of concentrating on New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa, which will hold its presidential caucus just eight days
before New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary, has more union
households than New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we can turn out a vote quicker in Iowa,'' said
Steve Rosenthal, the political director of the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement is also expected to help Gore in other major
states with early contests, including New York, California and
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen's endorsement of Gore is not unexpected. Her husband,
Bill, is the chairman of the Gore presidential campaign in New
Hampshire, and he has long joked about having some influence over
the governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been working on her,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the timing of the Shaheen endorsement is unexpected, coming
much sooner than Gore campaign aides were talking about this
summer. They had anticipated an endorsement closer to the Feb. 1
primary.
</P>
<P>
   But this summer, Bradley trailed Gore by double digits in most
state polls. Polls taken last month show the vice president
slightly ahead of Bradley in some polls and slightly behind in
others.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Because much of the party establishment in New Hampshire has
been backing Gore, Bradley has worked quietly to organize a
grass-roots campaign in the state. Hundreds of student volunteers
for Bradley have been fanning out across the state to knock on
doors and canvass support.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear just how influential Shaheen's endorsement and her
political organization will have on the presidential race in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Gov. John Sununu used his political organization to
rescue Vice President George Bush's flailing Republican campaign.
But in 1996, Pat Buchanan won the GOP primary even after Gov. Steve
Merrill endorsed Sen. Bob Dole, adding to New Hampshire's legacy of
giving momentum to insurgent candidates.

TAPPING CONSUMER LOYALTY MAY BE BOON FOR PROFIT-HUNGRY NET SERVICE
PROVIDERS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By REBECCA FAIRLEY RANEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before his favorite football team started an Internet service,
Brett Fennell jumped from one online service to another. But when
the Baltimore Ravens offered Internet access with premium
information about the team, Fennell found a provider he plans to
keep.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does he get a chance to buy tickets ahead of the
general public, but he also receives statistics about the team
before the numbers reach the newspapers _ a great advantage in his
fantasy football league.
</P>
<P>
   Fennell, a 29-year-old who develops e-commerce strategies for
Airtouch Cellular in Atlanta, said the service allowed him to
choose the information that would be sent to him online.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really like all the sales pop-up stuff that came with
all the other services,'' he said. ``The Ravens information is what
I want to get hit with.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Fennell's e-mail address and start-up page end with
raven.nfl.com, the Internet service provider, or ISP, he logs into
is PSINet. The Ravens are one of about 30 organizations that have
deals with PSINet to market an Internet service under the
organizations' own names.
</P>
<P>
   Tapping into consumers' loyalty to a group, a school, a team or
myriad other organizations or institutions could prove a boon to
profit-starved Internet service providers. Some analysts and
executives predict that in coming years these so-called ``affinity
ISP's'' will become the dominant way Internet services attract
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   The attraction for the affinity groups is that they get a useful
marketing tool, and if they attract enough subscribers, they earn a
slim profit on each subscription.
</P>
<P>
   Any entity with followers, from church groups to rock stars, is
a likely candidate. David Bowie was one of the first celebrities to
create an Internet service; part of the appeal for subscribers is
that he drops in for online chats from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   Though the models vary, in most cases the affinity groups
receive their Internet service at a wholesale rate, then make money
on subscriptions by charging customers a higher rate. The affinity
groups also take a percentage of profits from products sold through
the service.
</P>
<P>
   Affinity ISP's represent a major savings in marketing costs for
Internet providers, reducing typical marketing costs of between
$100 and $150 to enroll each new subscriber to nearly nothing.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, increased subscriber loyalty can also cut the high
cost of churn. These days, Internet service providers can count on
losing one subscriber out of five in the course of a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, it's all about the customer relationship,'' said Zia
Daniell Wigder, an analyst for Jupiter Communications. ``All of
these players are trying to lock in the customer relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Early research shows that Internet users welcome the concept.
More than 47 percent of online households would switch to an
affinity service if offered incentives, according to a consumer
survey conducted by Jupiter Communications in March.
</P>
<P>
   That is why AT&AMP;T and the Concentric Network Corp., like PSINet,
are aggressively courting partners for affinity services as a way
to compete with America Online, which has more than 18 million
subscribers and 40 percent of the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're deadly serious about this being a very important part of
our Internet strategy,'' said Bruce Jackson, vice president of
Global Offering Management for AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   The company recently helped begin two high-profile affinity
programs: free Internet access from United Parcel Service and a
Spanish- and Portuguese-language Internet service for Star Media
that crosses national boundaries in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore Ravens hope to build community through their own
Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of view it as the ultimate fan club,'' said Kevin
Byrne, a spokesman for the team. ``We're going directly to our best
fans without going through the filter of the media.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the service is marketed as a way for fans to get news
about the team before it hits the newspapers. Subscribers are
offered the same level of information as the news media receive.
And in addition to priority access to tickets, they can chat with
coaches and players.
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens, now in their fourth season, have built a large
audience to whom the Internet service can be marketed. The first
target group was the 25,000 season ticket holders, followed by
leads from the 70,000 tickets that go to single-game ticket buyers.
For each subscription, the team receives $1 a month.
</P>
<P>
   So far, since April, fewer than 5,000 people have signed up for
the service. But the appeal has gained momentum since July, when
the team offered subscribers live video feeds from training camp.
During a three-day trial, 1,000 people downloaded the live feeds.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the ISP's that have moved aggressively into the affinity
market appear to have attracted a small proportion of their total
subscribers through such partnerships. PSINet's 30 groups,
including the Ravens, have brought in what one executive described
as ``the high tens of thousands'' of new customers. Concentric,
which has been in the affinity business since 1997, reports
bringing in 70,000 subscribers that way, while AT&AMP;T says it has
signed on about 120,000 subscribers through affinity services.
</P>
<P>
   Affinity groups, however, face potential pitfalls. Generally
they must guarantee to sign up a minimum number of subscribers to
secure discounted rates. If the groups fail to deliver the
subscribers in six to eight months, the rates increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten thousand would be a runaway success for an affinity,''
said Harry Lalor, director of wholesale management for PSINet. ``We
ask for 5,000.''
</P>
<P>
   With fewer subscribers than that, he said, the model is not
feasible.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, if the e-mail server crashes, customers are most
likely to blame the group whose name is on the service.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, more and more organizations are willing to take
those risks.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Parker of Lubbock, Texas, started a small affinity service
with several Internet partners last year. Parker put $3 million
into the company, a filtered service called Clean Web, and targeted
the Christian market. After spending $1.5 million on magazine
advertising, he attracted only 5,000 subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is changing his marketing strategy. He is putting
together a deal to provide a specialized affinity Internet service
for Women of Faith, a national women's Christian organization
similar to Promise Keepers. The numbers look encouraging: The
organization has 600,000 members, and 67 percent of them use the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Considering this kind of potential, Parker recently presented a
plan to investors that showed a way to deliver 500,000 subscribers
in 5 years. He could approach that figure just by signing a deal
with Women of Faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are successful in converting a lot of them over,'' he
said, ``it doesn't take a lot of time to reach those kinds of
numbers.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before his favorite football team started an Internet service,
Brett Fennell jumped from one online service to another. But when
the Baltimore Ravens offered Internet access with premium
information about the team, Fennell found a provider he plans to
keep.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does he get a chance to buy tickets ahead of the
general public, but he also receives statistics about the team
before the numbers reach the newspapers _ a great advantage in his
fantasy football league.
</P>
<P>
   Fennell, a 29-year-old who develops e-commerce strategies for
Airtouch Cellular in Atlanta, said the service allowed him to
choose the information that would be sent to him online.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really like all the sales pop-up stuff that came with
all the other services,'' he said. ``The Ravens information is what
I want to get hit with.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Fennell's e-mail address and start-up page end with
raven.nfl.com, the Internet service provider, or ISP, he logs into
is PSINet. The Ravens are one of about 30 organizations that have
deals with PSINet to market an Internet service under the
organizations' own names.
</P>
<P>
   Tapping into consumers' loyalty to a group, a school, a team or
myriad other organizations or institutions could prove a boon to
profit-starved Internet service providers. Some analysts and
executives predict that in coming years these so-called ``affinity
ISP's'' will become the dominant way Internet services attract
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   The attraction for the affinity groups is that they get a useful
marketing tool, and if they attract enough subscribers, they earn a
slim profit on each subscription.
</P>
<P>
   Any entity with followers, from church groups to rock stars, is
a likely candidate. David Bowie was one of the first celebrities to
create an Internet service; part of the appeal for subscribers is
that he drops in for online chats from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   Though the models vary, in most cases the affinity groups
receive their Internet service at a wholesale rate, then make money
on subscriptions by charging customers a higher rate. The affinity
groups also take a percentage of profits from products sold through
the service.
</P>
<P>
   Affinity ISP's represent a major savings in marketing costs for
Internet providers, reducing typical marketing costs of between
$100 and $150 to enroll each new subscriber to nearly nothing.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, increased subscriber loyalty can also cut the high
cost of churn. These days, Internet service providers can count on
losing one subscriber out of five in the course of a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, it's all about the customer relationship,'' said Zia
Daniell Wigder, an analyst for Jupiter Communications. ``All of
these players are trying to lock in the customer relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Early research shows that Internet users welcome the concept.
More than 47 percent of online households would switch to an
affinity service if offered incentives, according to a consumer
survey conducted by Jupiter Communications in March.
</P>
<P>
   That is why AT&AMP;T and the Concentric Network Corp., like PSINet,
are aggressively courting partners for affinity services as a way
to compete with America Online, which has more than 18 million
subscribers and 40 percent of the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're deadly serious about this being a very important part of
our Internet strategy,'' said Bruce Jackson, vice president of
Global Offering Management for AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   The company recently helped begin two high-profile affinity
programs: free Internet access from United Parcel Service and a
Spanish- and Portuguese-language Internet service for Star Media
that crosses national boundaries in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore Ravens hope to build community through their own
Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of view it as the ultimate fan club,'' said Kevin
Byrne, a spokesman for the team. ``We're going directly to our best
fans without going through the filter of the media.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the service is marketed as a way for fans to get news
about the team before it hits the newspapers. Subscribers are
offered the same level of information as the news media receive.
And in addition to priority access to tickets, they can chat with
coaches and players.
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens, now in their fourth season, have built a large
audience to whom the Internet service can be marketed. The first
target group was the 25,000 season ticket holders, followed by
leads from the 70,000 tickets that go to single-game ticket buyers.
For each subscription, the team receives $1 a month.
</P>
<P>
   So far, since April, fewer than 5,000 people have signed up for
the service. But the appeal has gained momentum since July, when
the team offered subscribers live video feeds from training camp.
During a three-day trial, 1,000 people downloaded the live feeds.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the ISP's that have moved aggressively into the affinity
market appear to have attracted a small proportion of their total
subscribers through such partnerships. PSINet's 30 groups,
including the Ravens, have brought in what one executive described

<P>
   ``Aqua!''
</P>
<P>
   As Dame Edna Everage pronounces it, the word scorches like a
branding iron on soft flesh. She is trying to be polite (sort of),
but her semaphoric facial tics clearly signal what this former
Australian housewife and newly self-anointed queen of Broadway
really thinks of aqua as a color choice for the exterior of a
house, even a house in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Aqua,'' &LR;  she repeats, reeling across the stage of the Booth
Theater, where her delightfully appalling new show, ``Dame Edna:
The Royal Tour,'' opened Sunday night. ``I had forgotten about
aqua.'' And her jaw drops so low, you expect it to shatter.
</P>
<P>
   This impromptu esthetic commentary occurred in a recent preview
performance of ``The Royal Tour.'' It came in response to a New
Jersey travel agent in that night's audience, who was chosen by the
Dame for a spot of gentle interrogation and whose name, clothing
and occupation had already been the subject of piercing
observations from the stage. But it was that aqua house that had
really gotten to Dame Edna. The dame herself, please note, was a
vision of restrained good taste with her mauve hair,
bubble-gum-pink evening wear and eyeglasses suggesting a rococo
roller coaster.
</P>
<P>
   Dame Edna Everage, the monstrous creation and alter ego of the
comedian Barry Humphries, is living, Technicolor testimony to the
fact that humor is based not just on what is said but on who is
saying it. If, for example, Anna Wintour, the severely chic editor
of Vogue, had been coolly scathing about that aqua-colored house,
it wouldn't have been funny at all. If Joan Rivers had been doing
the disses, it might have been funny but also rather unpleasant.
</P>
<P>
   With Dame Edna, who is as unexpurgated an insult wielder as Ms.
Rivers and Jackie Mason, the barbs tickle instead of sting, and
material that is as old as the Catskills (or whatever their
Australian equivalent is) suddenly seems miraculously fresh. This
is because Humphries had the inspired idea, 40-some years ago, of
creating a comic persona that was the essence of insufferable
middle-class smugness: a suburban matron whose sense of her
unfailing superiority to the rest of the vulgar world was magnified
to grotesque dimensions. In the succeeding decades of evolution
Dame Edna (who is now, one presumes, in her mid-60s, like
Humphries) has become one of the most cherished comic performers in
Britain. In the process she has also grafted onto her image the
insufferable smugness of stardom, the aura of someone to whom all
the world is an audience, hence on a lower level than herself.
</P>
<P>
   As she points out in ``The Royal Tour,'' what's happening
onstage isn't so much a proper show as ``a conversation between two
people, one more interesting than the other.'' She adds with her
customary steely sweetness, ``I wouldn't pay to see you.''
</P>
<P>
   Dame Edna is articulating the subtext of what it means to be
famous in this culture. And when you see her, in clips from her
television specials, talking to glitzy eminences like Cher, Zsa Zsa
Gabor and George Hamilton in the film documentary that introduces
``The Royal Tour,'' she seems only marginally more surreal than her
guests. Celebrity, that most coveted of statures in today's
society, can make a monster out of practically anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Royal Tour'' is accordingly a sustained exercise in
self-worship, with every member of the audience an acolyte and
potential recruit for dialogues and participation sequences that
confirm the absolute wonderfulness of the evening's star.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Dame Edna shows a special affinity for those seated in
the mezzanine and balcony, whom she addresses heartily with
``Hello, paupers!'' When they answer, she muses, ``Listen to their
wistful cries.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who know Dame Edna from her English shows and television
specials will find many of the jokes and references familiar, like
those to her late husband's notorious prostate condition and the
special talents of her son, Kenny, who makes all her dresses and is
still looking for Miss Right. Dame Edna also screeches and stomps
her way through several vivacious musical numbers, accompanied by
Andrew Ross on the piano and a backup team of two pretty young
women, Roxane Barlow and Tamlyn Brooke Shusterman, identified as
``The Gorgeous Ednaettes.''
</P>
<P>
   The dame has also now incorporated David Letterman-style
sequences in which she orders food from a local restaurant for
peckish-looking theatergoers (rightly observing that ``you need
energy for my show'') and makes telephone calls to friends,
relations and baby sitters of other audience members. There are
some newly tailored topical jokes, aimed specifically at New York
audiences, with references to the likes of Hillary Rodham Clinton
and Blaine Trump, the socialite whom Edna claims to have known when
``she worked behind the counter at Christie's,'' as well as wry
acknowledgments of the gay contingent among those who have come to
see the show.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the jokes stand securely on their own; others are
feeble, still others are wearyingly stale. The shtick about being
politically incorrect, with its attendant references to subjects
like taxi drivers with no vowels in their names, is pure Jackie
Mason. But ultimately the jokes count for far less than the
overwhelming presence of the narcissistic creature making them.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Humphries is not only a loopy social satirist but also a great
instinctive physical comic. This is evident in Dame Edna's wide,
galumphing stride; in the manifold ways in which her elastic mouth
registers contempt and horror, in her voice's sudden drop into
guttural bass notes as she describes the unspeakable smell of the
pit bulls kept by her lesbian daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to rise above you,'' sings Dame Edna in her final
musical number, in which she achieves a spectacularly staged
apotheosis. ``It's my secret of survival.'' But for all her
selfishness, the dame has also somehow taken us up into the
empyrean with her. Tossing tall gladiolas, her trademark, into the
audience, she turns the evening into an absurdist, reality-warping
rhapsody cast in garish pastels.
</P>
<P>
   ``C'mon, possums, wave your gladiolas,'' she crows. And as the
audience obliges, it seems to have been admitted, however briefly,
to that exclusive Olympian club of which Dame Edna is the president
and sole member.

PATENTS: MAKING ONLINE DATA MORE ACCESSIBLE; PORTABLE POCKETS FOR
ALL THAT GEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Nev.)  (lb) 
 By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This may be the digital age, but even as technology spreads,
people are left out _ some because they cannot afford the hardware
and services needed for joining the information era, but others
because they don't like or can't master computers.
</P>
<P>
   Three inventors have patented a system that allows those who
haven't made the leap from printed paper to computer screens to
receive digital data on their televisions simply by turning the
pages of a book, newspaper or magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer Rathus and Lois Fichner-Rathus, both from Short Hills,
N.J., and Jeffrey Nevid of New York City, figured that just about
everyone peruses books, magazines and catalogs. Many of the goods,
services, companies and organizations that now appear on Web sites
are also featured in printed advertisements and articles.
</P>
<P>
   So the three inventors decided that the computer-reluctant
public ought to be able to simply touch an icon printed on those
pages and access Web sites, databases and software. The icon
contains a sensor that sends a message requesting data from a
remote server.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, computer use continues to spread among
adults, and an argument can be made that an entire generation of
children exposed to computers at school, home and game arcades will
not shun them later in life. But the Rathuses and Nevid believe
that plenty of people will continue to be stymied by computers
``despite significant advances in user-interface technology such as
mouses, windows, menus and the like.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed, it is clear that the number of programming choices
available to the user of such technology will be far greater than
the number of choices involved in programming a VCR, a task already
demonstrated to be too complicated for the average user of
present-day user-interface technology,'' they write in their
patent.
</P>
<P>
   The printed icon containing the sensor also holds a transmitter.
The sensor is activated by the turn of a page, the tap of a finger
or the pass of a pointer or mouse-style device. The transmitter
then sends a coded signal that identifies the icon to a
microprocessor. The microprocessor in turn forwards a command to a
remote video server.
</P>
<P>
   The inventors allow for many ways of accomplishing this last
link _ the command might travel via telephone, cable, modem,
satellite, cellular, microwave or infrared connections. The form
chosen depends on the bandwidth necessary to send the reply data.
The server sends the requested digital data to the user's
television or other monitor.
</P>
<P>
   The patent also covers use of a scanner that could read bar
codes or magnetic strips on a page and send a similar coded signal
to the microprocessor.
</P>
<P>
   The inventors say that people who shop through catalogs could
join the world of electronic commerce with their system. Instead of
accessing a retail Web site, a buyer could press sensors embedded
in a catalog and prompt the retailer's remote server to send sales
information to the buyer's TV or process an order.
</P>
<P>
   They also suggest that textbooks and other instructional
publications like cookbooks or manuals could come with sensors that
would link readers to databases or tutorials.
</P>
<P>
   The inventors say users would pay for the data either by volume,
like present online service providers, or according to the type of
material requested, like current cable television pay-per-view
programming. The developers received patent 5,932,863.
</P>
<P>
   A Portable Pocket for All That Gear
</P>
<P>
   Technology is supposed to make life easier, more efficient, more
timely. But it does create one problem: how to carry an assortment
that might include a cell phone, a personal organizer, a beeper and
other hardware. Not everyone wants to take a purse or briefcase
everywhere they go. Pockets are one answer, but not all garments
have the right size pockets in convenient places.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Jeffrey Richards offers his portable pocket. Richards, an
inventor from Las Vegas, has patented a pocket that can be added to
any piece of clothing, moved or removed completely, without
altering the clothes with adhesive or hook and loop fasteners like
Velcro.
</P>
<P>
   The pocket attaches to a base plate made of metal, rubber or
plastic, which in turn is affixed to a flat back plate. The back
plate is designed to be inserted under a garment, and the pocket
base plate rests on the outside of the garment. The fabric is
sandwiched between the two plates. The plates have male and female
attachment points and are held in place with multiple pins, snaps
or magnets, and a spring-loaded sliding lock so they don't move.
</P>
<P>
   The pocket _ which can have a flap or a zipper, or can hang open
_ hides the base. The back plate is adjustable to accommodate
different thicknesses of fabric. Richards received patent
5,946,732.
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be
ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent
and Trademark Office, Washington, DC 20231.

   Having brought large amounts of rainfall and gusty winds to
parts of Florida and the Southeast Seaboard, the remnants of
Hurricane Irene will move to the northeast Monday, passing south of
Long Island. Ahead of this system, winds will increase to gale
force at some spots on the coast, while showers, some of which will
be heavy, will cross much of the Middle Atlantic and New England
coasts.
</P>
<P>
   A cold front will sweep through the Northeast, bringing much
cooler and drier air to the Ohio Valley and into northern New
England. Temperatures will remain in the 50s over much of the Ohio
Valley, while readings will struggle to get out of the 40s in the
higher elevations of the Northeast. It will also be rather breezy
in the Northeast, adding to the noticeable chill. Skies will clear
across this region Monday night, allowing temperatures to plummet
once the sun sets.
</P>
<P>
   In the Southeast, cooler air will filter into many locations,
bringing a break from humid conditions. Meanwhile, another cold
front will cross the Middle West, accompanied by some rain and snow
showers over the northern Plains. Farther west, a surge of cold air
moving to the south along the front range of the Rockies will bring
chilly readings and scattered patches of light snow.
</P>
<P>
   Showers will likely develop in Texas, where a jet stream
disturbance will pass overhead. There could even be an isolated
rumble of thunder. Meanwhile, offshore flow over the Pacific Coast
will bring warm readings and abundant amounts of sunshine from
California to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Irene's Rains
</P>
<P>
   In southern Florida, Hurricane Irene will be remembered for its
rain, not its winds. The highest official sustained wind speed was
66 mph at a buoy near Key Biscayne. The threshold for hurricane
force winds is 75 mph. However, rainfall was prodigious and
flooding was extensive. Rain totals of 7 to 14 inches were common,
with a maximum official value of 17.45 inches at Boynton Beach.
Although a few prior hurricanes have produced higher single-point
rainfalls, the total volume of rain from Hurricane Irene over
southern Florida rivals any hurricane on record there. &QL;

<P>
   The last time Robert Westmoreland promoted a new computer-game
concept, the industry first laughed but then chased him, after his
idea proved a huge winner. And starting Monday, he hopes that
history repeats itself _ the Lord and the marketplace willing.
</P>
<P>
   The fresh gaming idea he is pushing now? Christian action games.
And his company's first entry, The War in Heaven, is being shipped
to stores this week. Whether this Doom-meets-the-Bible game will be
a success is anybody's guess. Yet the 32-year-old Westmoreland has
a track record as someone with an instinct for popular tastes in a
game market that is broadening beyond its technophile roots _ a
byproduct of the spread of personal computers into more and more
American households thanks to fast-falling PC prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may sicken traditional gamers, but my gut feel is that this
game will be a hit,'' said Ann Stephens, president of PC Data Inc.,
a research firm which tracks the $1.5 billion-a-year PC game
market. ``Besides, it sounds a lot more interesting than the last
idea he championed.''
</P>
<P>
   Westmoreland's last unconventional stance came a few years ago
when, as the computer software buyer for Wal-Mart Stores Inc., he
prodded the industry to make budget-priced hunting games. At first,
his suggestion met bemused derision. But one adventurous
computer-game publisher listened, and the result was Deer Hunter, a
surprise best seller, prompting a flurry of hunting games and even
a spoof title, Deer Avenger, in which the buck stalks the hunter.
</P>
<P>
   So next comes the Christian action game. The War in Heaven is
published by Valusoft, which Westmoreland joined in September,
after leaving Wal-Mart, as part-owner and executive vice president
of marketing and development.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, software with a Christian theme has tended to be
staid and didactic, mainly Bibles and children's games that quiz
players on their Bible knowledge. What qualified as a big-budget,
entertainment product in the Christian niche was ``Charlton
Heston's Voyage Through the Bible,'' a CD-ROM released in 1995,
with readings by Heston and video clips of the Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
   By the standards of the genre, The War in Heaven is a striking
departure. In the action game, intended for Christian males 15 and
older, a player is confronted with snarling monsters, with horns
and wings, wielding swords and other lethal weapons. That is the
challenge if the player chooses ``the Divine Path of Obedience,''
becomes a good angel and progresses up the game's 12-step ascent to
heaven. Yet a player can also choose ``the Fallen Path of Power and
follow Lucifer,'' become a demon and fight against shapely blondes
with feathery wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you mention that it's a Christian game, people assume
there's no violence,'' Westmoreland observed. ``Sure, there's
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he notes, there are no gushers of blood and gore, so
frequent in games rated for adults only. The War in Heaven is rated
``T'' by the Entertainment Software Rating Board, which means it is
recommended as suitable for people 13 and older.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the game reaches store shelves, its playful approach
to religious instruction has raised eyebrows in the Christian
community and elicited qualms from some retail chains. But the two
young men who created The War In Heaven _ Theodore Beale and Andrew
Lunstad, cofounders of the software design firm Eternal Warriors _
say that they have merely tried to create a Christian game that
might appeal to a broad audience among computer gamers reared on
the likes of Doom and Diablo.
</P>
<P>
   The violence, they add, is a role-playing depiction of
``spiritual warfare,'' a concept that has made some inroads into
mainstream theology. Spiritual warfare, theologians explain, is the
notion that nonphysical agents of good and evil are constantly at
war and that their behavior affects people on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Valusoft does publish some irreverent games, like Lawyer Hunt,
but the company insists The War in Heaven is not among them. And
both of the game's creators are devout Christians who say there
should be no contradiction in having fun on a computer game and
learning spiritual truths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, this is a spooky thing to be attempting in some
ways,'' said Lunstad, 30, who was the chief programmer for the
game. ``And let's face it, when you have angels fighting demons, it
is going to be controversial.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he added, ``I truly feel that God called me to do
this.''
</P>
<P>
   To explain the instructional side of the game, Lunstad said that
if a person chooses to play as a demon, he progresses by disobeying
the Bible. ``But as you progress down the evil path, you have to do
things that are more and more distasteful, from blasphemy to
striking a praying angel,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Without giving away the game, Lunstad noted that the evil path
leads to self-destruction. ``And Theo and I really believe that to
be true,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Boyd, a theology professor at Bethel College, finds the
new computer game impressive. A scholar with graduate degrees from
the Yale Divinity School and the Princeton Theological Seminary,
Boyd is the author of ``God At War: The Bible and Spiritual
Conflict'' (Intervarsity Press, 1997), which made the case for
spiritual warfare being a serious theological concept.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd also has a 14-year-old son, Nathan, who has played a test
version of The War in Heaven. ``He loved it,'' Boyd said. ``He
compared it to Doom, except with a spiritual twist.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The early reaction from Christian groups seems to be guarded,
though not antagonistic. ``Our concern would be if this game mocked
people of faith in any way,'' said Mike Russell, a spokesman for
the Christian Coalition. ``It doesn't sound as if it does, though
it does seem to take a pretty unique approach to religious
education.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the big retail chains are apparently taking a
wait-and-see stance toward the game, aware that customers can be
unpredictably sensitive about products with religious themes. Wim
Stocks, a senior vice president at GT Interactive, the distributor
for The War in Heaven, said last week that many major chains had
agreed to distribute the game, but several were sitting on the
fence. ``Some of the chains are nervous,'' said Stocks, who
declined to name the retailers carrying the game or those balking.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Priced at $19.95, less than half the price of traditional adult
PC games, The War in Heaven meets the industry definition of a
budget game _ a fast-growing slice of the market, built largely on
sales at big discount chains like Wal-mart, Target and Kmart.
</P>
<P>
   Pocketbooks, a division of Viacom's Simon &AMP; Schuster book
publishing subsidiary, is betting on The War in Heaven. It is
publishing a mass-market paperback novel by the same title, written
by Beale, next spring. ``It's a good fantasy story, though
definitely one with a different take than most science fiction,''
said Scott Shannon, director of science fiction for Pocketbooks.
``And I thought it would be highly marketable.''
</P>
<P>
   If the game is successful, Westmoreland of Valusoft predicts
that Christian action games could become sizable segment of the PC
game business. ``There is plenty of source material,'' he observed.
``You need look no further than the Bible for battles.''

 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ You've read the books. You may even see the movie. Now,
behold the stock.
</P>
<P>
   For months now, the phenomenon of the publishing world has been
Harry Potter, the magical English schoolboy chronicled in three
books of fiction that currently occupy the three top slots on The
New York Times' hardcover best-seller list _ with a staggering 5
million hardcover and 3 million paperbacks in print in the United
States alone. Since 1997, additionally, the books have sold 2.2
million copies in the English-speaking world outside the United
States, from Britain to Canada to Australia, making them best
sellers from London to Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath this well-publicized literary storm, though, there is
another, less-told tale of publishing near misses and a shrewd call
by a medium-size British house, Bloomsbury Publishing PLC, which
not only brought Harry Potter into print but has also brought
investors flocking to its stock.
</P>
<P>
   After other publishers passed up the adventures of the
tousle-haired schoolboy wizard, Bloomsbury was the first book
publisher on either side of the Atlantic to seize on the stories
and their creator, J.K. Rowling.
</P>
<P>
   And the stock market, not known for literary sensitivity, has
fallen under the spell. First floated on the London Stock Exchange
in 1994 at 105 pence, Bloomsbury shares had languished within a few
pence of that price ever since _ until last spring. Then the Harry
Potter phenomenon gathered steam, and Bloomsbury's shares took off
like Harry's magic broomstick, closing on Friday at 456.5 pence
($7.62), a 176 percent rise since April 30.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad results from an initial investment of $3,300 in 1996,
which is the advance Bloomsbury paid for the first Harry Potter
book, published the following year as ``Harry Potter and the
Philosopher's Stone.'' Who could have predicted back then that by
the time ``Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,'' the third
book in the series, went on sale in Britain last July, just before
school vacation, booksellers would feel compelled to delay the
released until 3:45 p.m. so that children would not play hooky to
snap up the first editions?
</P>
<P>
   Although the greater marketing might of the publisher of the
U.S. editions, Scholastic Corp., has undoubtedly helped stoke
Potter fever, Bloomsbury has benefited from being able to release
the British editions a few months before the American versions.
Many American children and their parents, in fact, know Harry and
his fellow students at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
Wizardry from the British versions they have bought over the
Internet _ books that use different art, different typography and
in some cases different spelling and vocabulary than their American
cousins. (With the first book, for example, the ``Philosopher's
Stone'' in the British title was changed to ``Sorcerer's Stone,''
for the American release.)
</P>
<P>
   Bloomsbury, with annual revenue last year of less than $25
million, is but a fraction the size of Scholastic, which had sales
of more than $1.1 billion last year. And Scholastic's stock price
has shown scant sign of a Potter levitation; the shares, which
closed on Friday at $47.94, are actually below their high for the
year of $58.75 on Jan. 6,
</P>
<P>
   But for Bloomsbury, the series' runaway success has been nothing
less than a coup _ for the editors who first spotted Ms. Rowling's
talent, and for the company's 44-year-old chief executive, Nigel
Newton. It was Newton who set up Bloomsbury with four partners and
$2.65 million in venture capital just 13 years ago and has since
advanced steadily in the staid world of British publishing.

   Quite apart from publishing the Harry Potter series, Newton, a
dual citizen of Britain and the United States, has helped created
another potential money-spinner: the Encarta World English
Dictionary, produced with the software giant Microsoft. Newton
approached Microsoft in 1991, proposing a joint CD-ROM and
bound-book dictionary project. The $48 book version, which
Bloomsbury released in August, has already sold 400,000 copies,
according to the company, which expects the dictionary to generate
some $68 million in sales over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Newton's bold, entrepreneurial management style has won him
strong support from the institutional investors that hold about a
quarter of Bloomsbury's shares, according to Louise Barton, a media
analyst with the brokerage firm of Investec Henderson Crosthwaite.
``They could be vulnerable'' to a takeover, Ms. Barton said, ``but
there would be strong support for the management from the
institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Written partly in cafes when the author, Ms. Rowling, was on
welfare as a single mother, the first book in the Harry Potter
series was initially rejected by a series of leading British
publishing houses. In fact, Ms. Rowling had trouble even finding an
agent to represent her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She sent three chapters,'' Christopher Little, her agent,
recalled of her over-the-transom submission in 1995. ``We don't do
children's books, so it was lying in the slush pile. It must have
been at the top because you pick up from the top. And so it got
read. There was something that was so exciting that we wanted her
on an exclusive basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with Little representing the book, though, at least four
more major British publishers rejected it. Then, an editor at
Bloomsbury scanned the opening page and began to read on, passing
chapters as they were read to colleagues around the office. The
company made its offer the next day.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling, Newton said, was that ``we have just bought the
most extraordinary book.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, where Ms. Rowling is currently on a
book-signing tour that is drawing crowds of children and adults,
more than a half-dozen publishers joined the bidding when Little
offered the first book to American publishers in 1997, after it was
released in Britain. Scholastic's Levine/Scholastic imprint beat
out a group that included Hyperion, Putnam and Random House with a
bid of $105,000.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Feiwel, publisher of the Scholastic Book Group in New York,
recalled the gamble: ``The auction went pretty high for a book that
was going well in England but hadn't broken any box-office records.
And it wasn't clear that the success would translate across the
ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner's Warner Brothers, meanwhile, signed a separate deal
for an unspecified amount for movie and merchandising rights. The
film is set to appear in 2001. Ms. Rowling herself has said she
will produce a book a year until the series is complete _ seven
books, one for each of Harry's years at the Hogwarts boarding
school, with the next one due out next July.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bloomsbury and Scholastic say they expect to publish the
entire series, although neither would disclose its financial
arrangements with Ms. Rowling. But already, Little said, the book's
earnings for the author are ``well into the seven figures, not yet
in eight figures.'' And, with four more books in the offing, some
critics have forecast that the tales will enter the pantheon of
children's books alongside the works of C.S. Lewis and other
enduring classics.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Arthur Levine, the Scholastic editor whose imprint is publishing
the American Harry Potter editions, sees their success as ``the
combination of a really great book getting a lot of attention and
that's magic. Even in this day and age, that can drive a business
success.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's not marketing magic,'' Levine said. ``It's the magic
of writing and the magic of reading.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bloomsbury, meanwhile, even if the Harry Potter publicity
blizzard has obscured some of Bloomsbury's other achievements, the
breakthrough has reinforced Newton's stated belief: In an age when
book publishing is often an appendage of a media leviathan, there
remains a place for smaller, independent outfits focused on
literary fiction and reference works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Publishing is still a human-scale activity, no matter how
large an entity you create around it,'' said Newton, whose company
is based in an 18th-century house in London's raffish Soho
district. ``So there's a very good argument for publishing being
done by units that combine the sort of clout that we do have as
publishers with flexibility, speed of decision-making and the lack
of bureaucratic layers.''
</P>
<P>
   Newton grew up in San Francisco, the son of an English father
and American mother. He came to Britain at age 18 as an
undergraduate at Cambridge University and has lived here virtually
ever since. He worked in publishing at Macmillian and then Sidgwick
&AMP; Jackson before starting Bloomsbury at the age of 31, where he
scored an early success with Scott Turow's ``Presumed Innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   And he has been quick to embrace the trans-Atlantic, digital age
_ not only with the Microsoft deal but also with an online
book-selling service, Bloomsbury.com, and plans for a U.S.
subsidiary, Bloomsbury USA.
</P>
<P>
   And what has all this meant for Bloomsbury's balance sheet?
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month the company released figures for the first
half of the year _ traditionally the least profitable period for
publishers _ showing that it had narrowed its losses to $169,000,
compared with a loss of $539,000 in last year's first half.
First-half sales of $10.56 million were up 30 percent from the
comparable period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The recent figures included the amortization of costs relating
to some of the $4.62 million in outlays from the Encarta deal with
Microsoft and the development of two other big database projects
the company is keeping under wraps.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, the first-half figures did not include the
success of the third Harry Potter book, which was published in
Britain on July 8 and released in the United States last month.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts now expect Bloomsbury to record a pretax profit for
this calendar year of more than $4.1 million on sales of $29.7
million. That will include the year-end holiday season, when Newton
is predicting huge sales, which he said he hoped would be buoyed by
special cloth-bound editions of the Harry Potter books that are to
retail for around $30 each, compared with about $18 for the current
cardboard hardcovers.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the company is not solely dependent on Ms. Rowling.
It has published best-selling work in Britain by pedigreed authors
who include Nadine Gordimer, Michael Ondaatje, Margaret Atwood,
David Guterson, Joanna Trollope, John Irving and Anna Pavord.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our interest is literary fiction and that's what we publish,''
Newton said. ``And if you examine the best-seller lists of the past
three years, it's quite clear that literary fiction is at the top
of the heap.''
</P>
<P>
   Louise Barton, the Investec analyst, said Bloomsbury's stable of
authors, as well as its Microsoft Encarta venture and other
database projects, would attract investors over the next few years.
She rates the stock a buy. ``Harry Potter is only one factor,'' she
said, but ``it's a high-profile factor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The City likes visibility,'' she said, referring to London's
financial district.
</P>
<P>
   And no one is pretending that so much visibility _ buzz might be
an even better word _ would have come to the company without that
upstart wizard, Harry Potter.

BILLIONS IN THE NAME OF A GREAT PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds., in 3rd graf, a plus sign should be set in type between
Telecom 99 and Interactive 99 where the words (plus sign) now
appear.)

<P>
   GENEVA _ $250 million. $1 billion. $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In the telecommunications industry these days, those are not
generally considered breathtaking amounts, what with $5 billion
takeovers becoming routine and $50 billion deals no longer
uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps it was not surprising that upwards of $3 billion was
among the informal estimates circulating here about how much was
spent on Telecom 99 (plus sign) Interactive 99, the International
Telecommunication Union's quadrennial confab. After all, the low
end of the range represents only $1,250 for each of the estimated
200,000 people who showed up.
</P>
<P>
   What was surprising was how little corporate news was generated
by all those dollars. Aside from the myriad announcements of arcane
new communications products, there were almost no publicized
financial or strategic deals of note.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, that hardly means the event was a bust. It is entirely
necessary, in fact, for every communications equipment vendor of
size to be there _ and to spend a lot of money, because it is an
incredible marketing opportunity. More countries, around 190,
belong to the International Telecommunications Union than belong to
the United Nations _ of which the ITU is an offshoot. And it
appeared that almost all of the members sent delegations, each of
whose members might have authority over the routine $10 million and
$50 million contracts that are the lifeblood of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, the ITU itself, with its broad power to shape
international technical standards, can be seen as a major client.
At least some of the almost 1,200 exhibitors here are jockeying for
influence in various ITU standards proceedings and may believe that
ignoring the organization's show is not the way to acquire clout.
</P>
<P>
   As a marketing forum, Telecom is best known for the extravagant
booths built by the biggest of its exhibitors. In fact, while
everyone here refers to them as booths, they are anything but. They
amount to indoor buildings, with elevators, kitchens and conference
rooms, in addition to the standard product demonstration areas. The
four-floor, 9,000-square-foot ``booth'' of Lucent Technologies
Inc., for instance, housed a lounge featuring a grand piano (and
player). Even so, Lucent's pavilion appeared smaller than that of
the Nortel Networks Corp. of Canada, which flanked it on one side,
and positively dwarfed by that of Alcatel SA of France on the
other.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the real shmoozing does not even happen at the
booths. The big equipment vendors (and some carriers) appear to
spare little expense in bids to impress current and potential
clients, government figures and journalists at lavish evening
events away from the convention center.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday night, for instance, Lucent sponsored the ITU's
official member states dinner and hired John Barry and Natalie Cole
for a musical performance before a buffet dinner at a cavernous
converted power plant straddling the Rhone River. Unfortunately,
the video display above the stage was plagued by ugly glitches, but
that was fixed before the two performed again the following night
before Lucent's client dinner (a sit-down affair).
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone by its arch-rival, Nortel invited more than
1,000 clients and friends to a private performance on Monday by
Diana Ross at the performance hall at Geneva's Casino. Before the
show ended, Ms. Ross sashayed through the crowd, dancing with a few
of the flushed attendees. There were surely many happy customers.
</P>
<P>
   But the most extravagant event of the week was the Cisco Systems
Netaid concert. Held on Oct. 9 in the Palais des Nations, the U.N.
European headquarters, the Geneva concert featured the actor
Michael Douglas as master of ceremonies and included musicians like
Bryan Ferry and Ladysmith Black Mambazo.
</P>
<P>
   Meant to combat poverty around the world and to promote the
Netaid Web site, the Geneva event was produced concurrently with
concerts in Giants Stadium in the Meadowlands in New Jersey and at
London's Wembley Stadium. But it undoubtedly carried a different
flavor from the other two concerts. While the London and New York
audiences appeared filled with young people who might have had a
few beers in the parking lot before the show, the mature audience
in Geneva wore ties and sipped Champagne before and after the show
in a space dominated by eight living statutes _ silent men and
women in white body paint slowly posing on pedestals.
</P>
<P>
   In video clips shown to the audience before the music began,
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, President Clinton and British
Prime Minister Tony Blair called Cisco's anti-poverty Web effort
unprecedented. But what really appeared unprecedented was Cisco's
ability to persuade three world leaders of such stature to promote
the image of a for-profit corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Truly ironic were some of the mundane communications hassles
presented at Telecom.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 10, for instance, shortly after the show's official
opening, a U.S. journalist unskilled in Swiss communications tried
to make a local phone call to his hotel to check for messages.
Stymied by a public pay phone that did not appear to accept coins,
he asked advice from a staffer at the information booth in the
conference's media center and was told that while phones were
available in the working press room, they required the use of
calling cards that could be purchased only across the road within
the convention hall itself.
</P>
<P>
   After purchasing a $14 card and returning to the press room, the
reporter was informed by a different member of the media team that
regular calling cards would not work on the press phones. Instead,
would he like one of the special, and free, cards being offered to
reporters for use in the press room?
</P>
<P>
   After accepting the new card and making the call to his
``five-star'' hotel downtown, the reporter was informed that the
hotel staff not only could not transfer him to his hotel voice
mail, but also could not determine if any messages were waiting
without going into his room and dialing into the system from there.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder cell phones are so popular in Geneva.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Not long ago, in the early hours of a Manhattan
morning, the choreographer Susan Stroman wandered into an
underground pool hall that turned into a swing club after midnight.
What caught her eye in the sea of black-clad couples swirling in
the smoky darkness was a single dancer in a yellow dress.
</P>
<P>
   The woman would step up to the dance floor as a song was
beginning and nod or shake her head at the various men asking to be
her partner. Then, after holding everyone's attention with her
nervy grace, she would disappear into the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   What came out of this was ``Contact,'' the dance-theater piece
that opened on Oct. 7 the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater in Lincoln
Center. In The New York Times Ben Brantley called the production
``a sustained endorphin rush of an evening, that rare entertainment
that has you floating all the way home.'' And because of those
words, as well as other strong reviews _ The New York Post called
it ``a beautiful, sexy and witty danse noire,'' Variety
``exhilarating,'' Newsday ``thoroughly original'' _ the show is now
sold out through its run, which concludes on Jan. 2, and it is due
to move to the Tony-eligible Vivian Beaumont in March.
</P>
<P>
   How the unconventional piece that is ``Contact'' came to life
turns out to be a surprisingly untortured tale of making theater, a
process often hindered by internecine politics and creative
differences. It demonstrates that in an age of corporate theater
ownership and risk-averse mega-musicals, it is still possible to
create a small gem that proves to be incandescent.
</P>
<P>
   While nonprofit institutions like Lincoln Center Theater are in
theory not supposed to worry about the bottom line, in reality they
have budgets to meet and boards to satisfy, so every one of them
has at one time or another harbored hopes of spawning the next
``Chorus Line,'' which had the Joseph Papp Public Theater earning
money for years.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of success is like winning the jackpot, and the money
goes right back into running the theater because there are no
investors to repay. ``Contact'' appears to have the potential to be
such a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be a theater-altering experience, this,'' said Bernard
Gersten, the executive producer of Lincoln Center Theater. ``The
ground shifts.''
</P>
<P>
   Although a hubbub now surrounds ``Contact,'' it all started
considerably more quietly. Andre Bishop, the artistic director of
Lincoln Center Theater, just called Ms. Stroman one day last year,
said he had admired her work in the Broadway productions ``Steel
Pier'' and ``Crazy for You'' and invited her to develop an original
project at his theater.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stroman immediately called her friend John Weidman _ who
wrote the book for ``Pacific Overtures'' and another Stephen
Sondheim musical, the forthcoming ``Wise Guys'' _ and asked him to
collaborate. ``John has a contemporary wit about him,'' Ms. Stroman
said. ``He loves dance, and not all writers love dance.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stroman said that at their first meeting she told Weidman
about her swing club experience, about the woman in the yellow
dress who ``knew some man was going to dance with her, and she was
going to change that man's life.'' The collaborators were off and
running.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really connected over this one image,'' Weidman said. ``It
seemed like a rich place to start to talk about relationships at
the end of the '90s in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The creators were also inspired by the Ambrose Bierce short
story ``An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge,'' in which a spy who is
about to be hanged escapes his noose in a dream.
</P>
<P>
   The creators at first considered doing a conventional musical.
But Weidman said that as they developed the character of Michael
Wiley for the segment called ``Contact'' _ an advertising
copywriter fails at a suicide attempt and stumbles into a swing
club where a dancer in a yellow dress gives him reason to live _
they soon settled on a piece defined primarily by movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The character came from a world that was all about language,
and language was something that failed him,'' Weidman said. ``He
was going to have to escape from language to get saved.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stroman said she chose an eclectic array of music _ the list
includes Robert Palmer's ``Simply Irresistible,'' Dean Martin's
``You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You'' and the Beach Boys' ``Do
You Want to Dance?'' _ to suit the different moments of the
miniplay. She also said she wanted the music to be on tape, not
live, so it would sound as it would in a club.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stroman and Weidman mounted a workshop of ``Contact'' at
Lincoln Center for Bishop, Gersten and other invited guests in
February. The playlet, featuring many of the current performers,
was enthusiastically received.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made your pulse race,'' Gersten said. ``The metaphor
affects me very deeply: can't dance, can't live.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Because ``Contact'' was only an hour, Bishop encouraged the
creators to flesh it out. Ms. Stroman and Weidman decided to
develop the theme of swinging further in all its meanings, with
``Contact'' as the second act and two shorter pieces for the first.
They also decided to have more dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the production opens with ``Swinging,'' a playful, bawdy
dance inspired by the Fragonard painting ``The Swing.'' It features
two men and a woman doing everything you can imagine it is possible
to do in elaborate clothing on a remarkably resilient swing, all
amid a sylvan setting designed by Thomas Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   This is followed by ``Did You Move?'' with Karen Ziemba as a
woman dining with her abusive husband in an Italian restaurant in
Queens in the 1950's. She can escape her oppressive marriage only
in her dancing fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ziemba, who has worked with Ms. Stroman before, said the
role kept evolving. ``I create stuff every night; it never stops,''
she said. ``It's all about what I'm feeling inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stroman has become known for presenting dancers who think
and have inner lives, for creating choreography that is organic
rather than merely cosmetic, for using movement to advance the main
story rather than decorate or distract from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never a separation: here are the steps, here is the
acting,'' said Deborah Yates, who plays the girl in the yellow
dress. ``There's no movement without a reason.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the supporting characters in ``Contact'' as well as
the main players have built characters with what Ms. Stroman called
back stories. The couples dining at tables surrounding Ms. Ziemba,
for example, have good marriages, Ms. Stroman said; one pair is
getting engaged that evening, the other is expecting a second
child. (Seeing a pregnant woman dance on stage seems an innovation
in itself.)
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Ms. Yates said she developed a character history for
her role, deciding where the girl in the yellow dress comes from,
what her real name is and other details that never get explored on
stage. ``I think this piece supports that kind of complexity,'' Ms.
Yates said. ``It's a role that uses all of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the reviews, this kind of preparation paid off.
Brantley compared Ms. Yates to Grace Kelly, saying she projected
``the requisite fire of wistfulness beneath the icy exterior.''
</P>
<P>
   To give the characters these levels, Ms. Stroman said, she had
to find dancers not only with technical proficiency but also with
emotional depth and a gutsy confidence. ``The people who are in
`Contact' are fearless,'' she said. ``And that really makes a star
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Most are dancers who can act. In the case of Boyd Gaines, who
plays Michael Wiley, and Jason Antoon, who plays the husband in the
second piece and the bartender in the third, they are actors who
can dance.
</P>
<P>
   At the auditions Ms. Stroman asked dancers to repeat a swing
routine with different qualities in mind: flirtatious, aggressive,
drunk, disinterested.
</P>
<P>
   When rehearsals began, she said, she developed the characters'
personas after watching them move with various partners. ``I could
see who connected, who didn't connect, who had an aggressive
connection with each other, who didn't fit,'' Ms. Stroman said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Sean Martin Hingston, who appeared in ``Crazy for
You'' and has been a guest star on the HBO series ``Sex in the
City,'' has a strong sensuality, Ms. Stroman said. Therefore his
character in ``Contact'' dances provocatively with Ms. Yates. On
the other hand Jack Hayes, who was in ``Steel Pier'' and
``Chicago,'' conveys more class and therefore dances with a more
formal romantic elegance.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way Ms. Stroman integrated the dancers' contributions.
``Somebody will be goofing off, and she'll see a brilliant moment
of humor in it,'' Ms. Yates said. ``She takes everybody's strength
and uses it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like any rehearsal process, there were hurdles: getting used to
performing in the round rather than on a traditional proscenium
stage, perfecting the timing so that dancers do not drop one
another or collide. There was the time, for example, that Ms.
Ziemba came riding out on the dessert cart and careered into the
cigarette lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``They dance within inches of each other,'' Ms. Stroman said.
``So someone who is off six inches will crash and have a domino
effect. It's a tight puzzle.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the technical glitches, like the fact that the
costume designer, William Ivey Long, had to change Ms. Yates'
arresting yellow dress nine times for various reasons _ one was too
slippery, another too sheer _ getting it right just 48 hours before
opening night. (There is now a yellow dress shrine in the wardrobe
room, featuring all the failed versions.)
</P>
<P>
   And because the production somewhat defies definition, the
producers were not sure quite what to call it, finally settling on
``a dance play.''
</P>
<P>
   As excited as they are about the show's reception, those
involved with it insist that creating ``Contact'' was its own
reward, that it was heady to help turn nothing into something.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop said the process reminded him of the lyric ``Look, I made
a hat/Where there never was a hat'' from ``Sunday in the Park With
George.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, we made a show,'' he said, ``where there never was a
show.''

SUPPORTERS OF LINUX WORRY THAT COMMERCIALIZATION COULD BRING CHAOS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Graying nerds who recall the Balkanization of Unix into a slew
of incompatible operating systems may be reliving history with the
proliferation of Linux brands.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Unix once promised to be the lingua franca of open
systems, the Linux operating system, itself a variant of Unix, has
been held out as standard for the open-source movement. But there
is growing concern that just as the Unix world slid into chaos like
a modern Tower of Babel, the commercialization of Linux will lead
to systems that cannot understand each other.
</P>
<P>
   Open systems promised to free computer users from the software
tyranny of hardware systems like the IBM's mainframes and the
Digital Equipment's minicomputers.
</P>
<P>
   Open-source software is based on the concept of making a
program's underlying code freely available and readily modifiable
by anyone. It has been promoted as a way of challenging the
dominance of the Microsoft's Windows.
</P>
<P>
   But fear and greed have a way of derailing good intentions. Unix
was created in 1969 by Kenneth Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at
AT&AMP;T's Bell Laboratories; the first popular variant, Berkeley Unix,
came along 10 years later, and it was followed by sundry
variations: Sun's Solaris, Hewlett-Packard's HP-UX, IBM's AIX,
Silicon Graphics' Irix. Some shared code but could not run the same
applications. Thus, programs like Web server software must be
rewritten for each Unix brand.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Linux grew out of the GNU Project, an effort to
create a free, Unix-like operating system. GNU created many
critical components of the system, but it lacked a kernel _ the
core piece regulating the movement of data _ until Linus Torvalds,
the Finnish programmer, created one in 1991 and named it after
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Although Linux and the GNU components can be downloaded free,
more than 22 companies today sell GNU/Linux software. The best
known are Red Hat, Suse, Turbo Linux, Caldera Systems and Mandrake
Soft. Last week, Silicon Graphics, VA Linux Systems and O'Reilly &AMP;
Co., a publisher of computer books, announced a plan to sell Debian
GNU/Linux, considered by some to be the purest version.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, these companies were founded largely on service
models, giving information technology managers someone to call _ or
blame _ when things went wrong. But each also packages Linux
differently, adding its own set of software tools for tasks like
diagnosing problems and maintaining networks. With so many
companies struggling to differentiate themselves, some experts say
incompatibilities are inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say that Balkanization is not as possible with Linux as
it was with Unix because Linus and the guys are controlling it,''
said Maureen O'Gara, publisher of Client Server News, a trade
publication. But some vendors, she said, ``are more inclined to
chase money and less inclined to share all their toys with their
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have some proprietary stuff they've developed and are
reluctant to put it in the public domain,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Others disagree. ``Only the trade press is really squeaking
about this,'' said Eric S. Raymond, president of the Open Source
Initiative, a programmer group, because it makes a good story hook
when you have nothing real to write about and the advertising
department is pressuring you to make closed-software vendors look
good.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond added: ``The actual Linux developers know better.
Fragmentation isn't going to happen, because developers outside of
the Linux distributors effectively control all the key pieces.''
That is because Torvalds and a small group of his colleagues
control the Linux standard and subject all modifications to peer
review.
</P>
<P>
   But Linux vendors are already pointing fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``One where you might see a problem is Caldera, because they see
part of their value added in proprietary tools they have licensed
from third parties,'' said Bob Young, Red Hat's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Benoy Tamang, Caldera's vice president for marketing, counters:
``We have produced a product that combines the best of open-source
and commercial packages; we are doing Linux for business. We do add
to it commercial packages that allow business users to easily
integrate it.''
</P>
<P>
   For example. he said, Caldera adds parts of Netware, Novell's
popular network operating system, which has long been an industry
standard for large corporations.
</P>
<P>
   There are also debates about which public domain tools to
include in a Linux distribution, as devotees prefer to call these
commercial packages. The biggest split is over two competing
graphical user interfaces: KDE, the oldest and the more mature, and
Gnome, an alternative introduced by the Free Software Foundation,
sponsor of the GNU Project, and Red Hat.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to head off further conflicts, nearly all the
Linux vendors have joined the Linux Standard Base project, whose
goal is to increase compatibility and insure that software will run
on any compliant Linux system. The project aims to define the core
functions of Linux by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Quinlan, chairman of the Linux Standard Base, said that so
far, most Linux developers have no incentive to introduce
incompatibilities, which was not the case with Unix. Most Unix
vendors, he pointed out, ``were selling a hardware platform of
their own, so right off the bat you had a hardware
incompatibility.''
</P>
<P>
   There ``wasn't a huge advantage'' for different hardware makers
to cooperate, he said, whereas for the most part Linux runs on
machines using Intel microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible that sooner or later there will be a conflict
between adding functionality and compatibility,'' Quinlan
acknowledged, but he added, ``It's not high on my list of
worries.''

RIDING THE TRAFFIC SURGES ON THE WORLD WIDE WEB
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Part of what has made e-commerce one of the most compelling
spectator sports of the year is this fact: No matter how much
experience executives have had running multimillion-dollar
companies in other industries, when it comes to Web retailing, many
of them are still making things up as they go along.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point is anticipating and preparing for changing
traffic patterns on the World Wide Web. While traditional retailers
can say precisely when and why their customers arrive _ and can
maximize their efficiency accordingly _ Internet merchants have
frequently been caught by surprise in the past year by traffic
surges.
</P>
<P>
   As e-commerce merchants brace for their second meaningful
holiday shopping season, however, they are beginning to decipher
some of the rhythms of their Internet shoppers. Namely, while Web
traffic in general becomes heavier as the day goes on, many
Internet retailers report that traffic is actually heaviest during
the middle of the day, between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. EST _ suggesting
that workers blessed with high-speed Internet connections remain
anchored to their desks at lunch time, sandwich in one hand, mouse
in the other.
</P>
<P>
   So, with the holidays rapidly approaching, some retailers are
shoring up their sites' technological infrastructure and hoping
they have enough capacity to handle the midday traffic smoothly.
Others, meanwhile, are looking beyond the back-office technology
issues into marketing opportunities presented by the 9-to-5 set.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, not every retail site is subjected to the same
midday shopping rush, analysts and executives said, because other
factors help determine the peaks as well. The type of goods sold
and the type of consumer the company attracts, for example, can
also affect a site's traffic patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lower-consideration purchases like books, gifts or flowers are
much more likely to be made during the daytime hours, since people
tend to see those things as a task that can be done quickly,'' said
Melissa Shore, an analyst with Jupiter Communications. ``With
things like computers, people will do a lot of research and then go
home and talk it over with their significant other or see if it's
compatible with their system, then go online and buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Travelocity, a travel site owned by the AMR Corp. that recently
announced a merger agreement with Preview Travel, peaks at 3 p.m.
EST, according to Terrell Jones, Travelocity's president. ``There
are a lot of busy dual-income families who can't book something at
night, when most travel agents are closed,'' he said.``And the
high-speed access at work certainly has an effect.''
</P>
<P>
   But marketing is also a factor, Jones said. Preview Travel
advertises heavily on America Online, which has heavier traffic
during the evening hours. ``So Preview's activity tends to be later
also. We're on Yahoo, which tends to peak earlier in the day,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Handling those peaks, of course, requires resources. Just as
brick-and-mortar stores plan for heavier shopping times by
scheduling more staff, Internet retailers need to rely on more
technology and personnel to get them through the rush. The great
fear of all Web merchants is that a traffic surge will catch them
by surprise _ landing them in the inauspicious company of Ebay,
Toysrus.com and ETrade as examples of sites that have occasionally
failed to handle their own peak loads.
</P>
<P>
   But even if a surge in users does not result in a system crash,
it can slow down the performance of a Web site sharply and alienate
potential customers. ``Our primary concern is making sure we can
handle all the traffic that doesn't come evenly,'' said Gabe Fried,
manager of research at Toysmart, an online toy retailer. That job,
he said, is complicated by the fact that traffic trends can change
quickly in response to marketing efforts, like an early-morning
promotion Toysmart recently began with Sesame Street.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign yielded ``a rather large shift in our peak hours
and processing hours,'' Fried said, but with beneficial results:
the site's traffic is now distributed more evenly through the day.
``That's better for us because it means less of a load on our
servers,'' he said, ``and better for users because the fewer of
them we have at one time, the faster the site is.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Web sites with less predictable traffic patterns could be in for
a long holiday season, said Jeff Nickerson, a partner in the
electronic business practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers. ``Last
holiday season, there were a lot of sites that were shocked, and
the consumers were a bit forgiving,'' he said. ``This time around,
there are so many more merchants that if stuff doesn't perform
well, sites will lose money big time.''
</P>
<P>
   More aggressive Web retailers, meanwhile, are looking into ways
to cash in on Internet users' lunchtime shopping habits.
Brookstone, which sells through its Web site, catalogs and stores,
is planning a radio advertising campaign that may include lunchtime
advertising, a spokesman said. Others are considering scheduling
more banner advertisements to be displayed on various Web pages
during lunchtime.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike radio and television broadcasters, however, not every
Internet publisher _ not even America Online _ has the
technological means to serve a banner ad for a specific time slot.
</P>
<P>
   But the technology is available. The Internet advertising
company Doubleclick enables the 8,000 sites in its network _ and
others that license the company's technology _ to serve ads
whenever they want, a company spokeswoman said. Thus far, she said,
the service has been most popular with financial advertisers, which
typically want their ads to appear mainly between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could argue that, yes, it does matter,'' said Nickerson,
of PricewaterhouseCoopers. ``People are more likely to buy during
these times than in other parts of the day. It's like the Internet
rush hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Since so many people are shopping at work, one would expect the
companies already involved with workplace Internet access to seek a
piece of the action. According to Ms. Shore of Jupiter, they may
get it. She predicted that e-commerce sites would start joining
forces with companies that set up intranet sites for corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say Amazon partnered with Peoplesoft, which puts
together a customized intranet for Time Warner,'' she said.
``Amazon could get massive exposure to Time Warner's employees, and
Time Warner could get discounts from Amazon that they could pass
onto their employees as a benefit. It makes sense for everyone.''

   LOS ANGELES _ A decade ago, Henry Yuen couldn't program his
videocassette recorder. Now he is vying to become the Bill Gates of
television.
</P>
<P>
   Yuen, 51, is the front-runner in the race to provide on-screen
program guides, which could be the first thing viewers see when
they turn on their television sets, as well as whenever they check
schedules. In a future of 500-channel digital television, some
analysts say, such on-screen guides could become as ubiquitous and
important for television as Microsoft's Windows operating system is
for personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   It is ``the remote control of the next generation of television
viewing,'' said Yuen, who has a doctorate in applied mathematics
and a law degree.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, his company, Gemstar International Group, emerged
from relative obscurity by agreeing to acquire the larger TV Guide
Inc. for $9.2 billion in stock. TV Guide is mainly known for
publishing the television-listing magazine, but it has also been
one of Gemstar's main rivals in providing such electronic program
guides. With the combination, some analysts say, Yuen is taking a
big step toward Gates-like dominance.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years from now I expect that most of the major TV, VCR
and set-top-box manufacturers on planet Earth will be loading
Gemstar's technology into their equipment in the factory,'' said
John Corcoran, an analyst with Stephens Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Gemstar has already had one hit product, the VCR Plus. Born in
1990 out of Yuen's frustration at his inability to record a
baseball game, VCR Plus lets consumers record a program by entering
a code number that is printed in the television listings in more
than 1,800 publications around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But that business is near saturation and Gemstar's future lies
with its programming guides.
</P>
<P>
   These are not the painfully slow scrolling lists that cable
television customers now see _ though those guides are produced by
TV Guide, so they will eventually be Gemstar's, as well. Gemstar's
guides are interactive, allowing viewers to scroll through program
listings several days in advance, or to search by categories like
movies or sports. Once a program is highlighted, viewers can press
a button to have it recorded or to have the television set turn on
automatically.
</P>
<P>
   High-end television sets that show Gemstar's program guide
whenever they are turned on are already being sold by Thomson SA,
Sharp and others. Gemstar's technology is also used in the
on-screen guide offered by the DirecTV satellite service, which is
owned by General Motors. And the company has licensed its
technology to Microsoft and America Online, which are developing
guides for services combining television and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Gemstar's leverage comes from its patents, and it is not shy
about enforcing them. Reproductions of the patents, encased in
glass frames, are hung on the walls of the company's headquarters
instead of artwork.
</P>
<P>
   While license fees from set manufacturers are lucrative, the
bigger potential is to sell advertisements on the program guide,
and, eventually, to use it as a gateway to electronic commerce.
Yuen's eyes light up as he runs through the assumptions: Viewers
will check the program guide four times an hour and view three
pages each time. Multiply by the seven hours a day the television
is on and by 2 million sets sold by the end of the year. The
result: 168 million page views a day. ``This is larger than
Yahoo,'' Yuen exulted, referring to the Web portal.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have given Gemstar, which has 200 employees, an
Internetlike valuation of $7.5 billion, with Yuen's 13.7 percent
stake, including options, worth about $1 billion. Unlike most
Internet companies, though, Gemstar is highly profitable, with net
income of $73.9 million, or 66 cents a share, on revenues of $166
million in its last fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   But cable television operators have posed a roadblock to Yuen's
plan. Reluctant to cede control of on-screen real estate, they have
often used guides supplied by TV Guide or builders of cable set-top
boxes.
</P>
<P>
   So Yuen is merging with TV Guide, giving TV Guide's major
shareholders, News Corp. and Liberty Media, the cable TV
programming unit of AT&AMP;T Corp., stakes of 20 percent each in
Gemstar. ``With this merger, we pretty much should have the
blessing of the entire cable industry and there should be no war,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast. Gemstar is still locked in patent litigation with
cable set-top-box makers General Instrument, Scientific-Atlanta and
Pioneer Electronic, which are developing their own on-screen
guides. On Wednesday, arbitrators ruled in Gemstar's favor in one
case against General Instrument, which expects to have to pay $25
million to $36 million in compensatory damages plus additional
punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the merger itself will be difficult to execute because
of hostility between Gemstar and TV Guide, which had been suing
each other for six years. Last year, TV Guide's predecessor
company, United Video Satellite Group, tried to buy Gemstar in a
hostile takeover that Yuen fought off. Gemstar's stock has since
more than tripled from the price offered by United Video, allowing
Gemstar to turn the tables. The merger agreement stipulates that
Yuen cannot be removed as chief executive for five years.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest challenge could be that the entire 500-channel
digital television era will arrive slowly, if at all. Even it does,
consumers might not like the guides.

COYOTES PUT BRUINS ON ICE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ When the Bruins headed west on their six-game sojourn,
they knew every game was going to be difficult. That certainly has
proven to be true.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were playing their third game in four nights and it
showed as they dropped a 2-1 decision to the Phoenix Coyotes
Saturday &UR;  &LR; night at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   It was just the latest in a long line of disappointments this
season as Boston fell to 0-5-3, 0-2-1 on the trip.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' lineup has been like the finger in the proverbial
dike. If they plug one hole, another opens. When some players are
going well, such as Jason Allison and Dave Andreychuk, too many
others aren't.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's uncalled for,'' said defenseman Kyle McLaren. ``We can't
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaren said there's not enough desperation in the dressing
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain guys need to pick it up,'' he said. ``Without
mentioning any names, I think they know who they are. Everybody
knows what they have to do on the ice and if they're not doing
their jobs, something is wrong. The 20 guys we put out there are
not working together for 60 minutes. There are lapses in their
games and it's costing us.''
</P>
<P>
   The game didn't start well for the Bruins. They spent the first
period back on their heels and pinned in their own end, thanks to
relentless pressure by the Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix outshot Boston, 14-4, in the first 20 minutes and, if it
hadn't been for goalie John Grahame, who got the start over Rob
Tallas, it's likely the Bruins would have been in a deep hole.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, nearly 13 minutes into the game, the Coyotes had a
12-2 shot advantage and the Bruins couldn't get anything going.
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes captain Keith Tkachuk, who was a force all night, had a
golden chance at the eight-minute mark when he drove in from the
right circle, but Grahame made the stop.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes continued to dominate at the start of the middle
period, though the Bruins picked up their play in the late going.
Joe Thornton had a terrific opportunity when he took a lead pass
from Sergei Samsonov and charged up the left wing. He drilled a
shot, but goalie Mikhail Shtalenkov, who is handling the netminding
duties during Nikolai Khabibulin's contract dispute, blocked it
with his pads.
</P>
<P>
   At 15:01, the Bruins started to get their offense in gear.
Allison had a breakaway on the right side. He tested Shtalenkov
with a forehand shot from in tight that was headed for the top
right corner, but the goalie snared it with his glove.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins broke through on the power play at 15:59. Allison,
behind the net, skated toward the right post, stopped, took a
stride the other way and passed to Andreychuk, who banged it past
Shtalenkov at the left post for the 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   That prosperity lasted for exactly 1 minute 9 seconds before the
Coyotes tied it on a goal by Tkachuk. The Medford native, who
barreled all over the ice, earned his second goal of the season at
17:08. Travis Green flipped a backhand pass from the right boards
to Dallas Drake in the right circle. Drake relayed it right to
Tkachuk, who fired an offspeed shot that caught Grahame off guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he fanned on it a bit,'' said Grahame. ``I thought
it was going to be a rocket, so I overplayed it. I was kind of out
and it went underneath my arm.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' fortunes only got worse early in the third period
when the Coyotes went ahead, 2-1, at 1:08.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk set it up, backhanding a pass from the right circle past
defenseman Darren Van Impe and right to Green, who rapped it past
Grahame.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to go out there and perform,'' said McLaren, clearly
frustrated. ``If we're not performing, something has to be changed
or looked at.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   OSH, Kyrgyzstan _ Ever since five new nations emerged in Central
Asia from the ruins of the Soviet Union, there have been warnings
that the region was ripe for Islamic insurrection and insurgency.
This summer, just such an insurgency erupted in Kyrgyzstan, the
smallest and most democratic country in the region.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-August, a band of about 1,000 religious fighters marched
from bases in neighboring Tajikistan, which has been torn by civil
conflict for years, across the mountain passes into Kyrgyz
territory. They captured a swath of land and 13 hostages, including
a Kyrgyz general and four Japanese geologists.
</P>
<P>
   Kyrgyzstan is no great military power, and President Askar
Akayev, a physicist, once even suggested that the country's army be
abolished as a gesture toward world peace. Nonetheless, with help
from neighbors, the 12,000-man Kyrgyz army might be able to crush
the insurgency without much trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The army has been held back, however, for fear that the
insurgents will harm their hostages, particularly the four
geologists from Japan _ this impoverished nation's largest
bilateral aid donor.
</P>
<P>
   Kyrgyz officers would like to attack the insurgents. One
officer, named Salai, sought to drown his frustration in drink at a
bar in Osh one recent evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were only allowed to fight, we could take out those
terrorists in a couple of days,'' said Salai, who had stars on his
uniform but who refused to give his last name. ``Some big political
game is holding us back. This is no way for an army to behave.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyrgyz leaders feel caught in a trap. They cannot afford to
upset their Japanese benefactors, but they fear that inaction will
give Islamic fundamentalism a foothold in the heart of Central
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very serious threat, and we need to approach it
soberly and clearly,'' said Askar Aitmatov, the chief foreign
affairs adviser to Akayev. ``We are apparently only one component
of a larger plot. It is the principal political challenge of
Central Asia now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ideal of these people is an Islamic regime, Islamic rule
in all Islamic states,'' Aitmatov said. ``In a situation of general
economic crisis and hardship, they may bring under their banner
those who are dissatisfied and made desperate by the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Osh, the main town in the region where the insurgency is under
way, feels different from the rest of Kyrgyzstan. Most people here
are ethnic Uzbeks. Many hold orthodox religious beliefs that
contrast sharply with the convictions of most Kyrgyz, whose nomadic
heritage has made them more spiritual than traditionally religious.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, bloodshed erupted between ethnic Uzbeks and Kyrgyz
here, taking hundreds of lives in the worst spasm of communal
violence in the modern history of Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Tempers have cooled considerably since then, and there is much
mixing among the various ethnic groups in Osh. Still, some Uzbeks
fear walking through Kyrgyz neighborhoods at night, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Most people here are poor, but conditions are not desperate.
Food is cheap because the surrounding soil is fertile.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, armed soldiers have begun appearing on the streets of
Osh. Military checkpoints surround the town. There is no palpable
sense of fear, but many people are worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is nervous,'' said Ravshan Mahmoudov, a hardware
vendor at the sprawling bazaar. ``There may be more terrorist
attacks, and we need to crush them or else the danger will grow.
These are very aggressive and strange people who want to kill
everyone for God.''
</P>
<P>
   Precisely what the insurgents want is unclear. At first they
demanded free passage to Uzbekistan, where their leaders said they
wanted to launch a holy war.
</P>
<P>
   But that demand struck some here as odd. President Islam Karimov
of Uzbekistan, reputed to be an unbending leader who controls a
considerable army, has publicly declared not only that all
religious insurgents should be killed, but also that he would be
pleased to kill every one of them himself.
</P>
<P>
   Some foreign diplomats in Bishkek, the Kyrgyz capital, speculate
that the militants may have fled Tajikistan to avoid complying with
a recent peace accord there, which requires private militias to
turn in their weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Others believe they staged their action in order to show their
paymasters, said to include the fugitive Saudi millionaire Osama
bin Laden, that they are active enough to deserve continued
support.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a mixture of true religious believers, drug smugglers,
and kids from places like Afghanistan and Tajikistan who don't know
anything but fighting and are in it to earn a wage,'' one diplomat
said.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers are swarming through the countryside southwest of Osh,
where the insurgents are holed up. They have reportedly formed a
semi-circle leaving the insurgents no way out except a return to
Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far there has been no hint whether the insurgents will
agree to return there. Their other choices would be to spend the
winter where they are or try to break through into Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
   The government has ruled out direct negotiations with the
insurgents, but under Japanese pressure has agreed to open indirect
channels. Japan has reportedly offered a ransom in excess of $1
million for the hostages, but leaders of the insurgents are said to
be divided over whether to accept it.
</P>
<P>
   Some want to take the money and run, while others fear that they
will be wiped out if they give up their human shields.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   All five Central Asian nations are predominantly Muslim, but
during the Soviet period, people here were required to keep their
beliefs private. Now they are reverting back to their religious
traditions, which in Kyrgyzstan are very tolerant but which are far
more rigorous in Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel it's only the beginning of a long-term problem,'' said
Askar Sarygulov, a former senior government official. ``The
presence of Islamic fundamentalists has completely changed the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never expected this in Kyrgyzstan,'' said Sarygulov. ``For
the first time I am seeing women who cover their heads. I am
completely surprised. During the seven years I was in the
government, I was well-informed, including by the KGB. No one ever
predicted that this could happen.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Perhaps it's a simple matter of an actor who hasn't
been told when to back off, but Reg Rogers pushes so hard in ``Look
Back in Anger'' that the play seems to cower in the corner whenever
he enters.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear from past productions that Rogers has theatrical
savoir-faire: one had only to see his Tony-nominated performance as
Ned Seton, the woebegone lush of Circle in the Square's 1995
rendition of ``Holiday,'' to have been convinced that he was a
young man with a future.
</P>
<P>
   But his Jimmy Porter, the terminal malcontent of John Osborne's
mid-century study of torpor and pessimism in the English Midlands,
is a scenery chewer of the highest order. It is as difficult to
watch his work here as it was a bona fide pleasure to catch him in
``Holiday.''
</P>
<P>
   Only at the beginning of Act II, when Jimmy is offstage, does
the drama have a chance to breathe. Upon his return the
overarticulated vowels and exaggerated contortions return to the
stage, too, turning snarling, working-class Jimmy into a sniveling
twit and obliterating any hope that this revival by the Classic
Stage Company will absorb an audience with the ferocity of Jimmy's
penchant for defaming whatever it is he cherishes.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers' accomplice is a director, Jo Bonney, who encourages her
leading man's suffocating excesses. The result is an unbalanced
production that italicizes the play's dated quality, its rather
dowdy plot and its intolerable lapses into cuddliness. (What's with
the cutesy pet names that Jimmy and his wife, Alison, give each
other?)
</P>
<P>
   Peter Hall, the well-known director, once observed that Osborne
demonstrated ``an amazing ability to draw into himself all the
sicknesses of the moment,'' but in Ms. Bonney's production, you
wait in vain for a hint of what Hall was referring to. As Rogers'
wrongheaded Gielgud-ish accent suggests, this is an ersatz England
ruled not by postwar blues but by dialect coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look Back in Anger,'' which opened Sunday night, takes place
entirely in the living room of the shabby flat occupied by Jimmy,
Alison (Enid Graham) and Jimmy's Welsh friend Cliff (James Joseph
O'Neill). Alison and Cliff are joyless bystanders to _ and
occasionally victims of _ Jimmy's tirades about the futility of
modern British life. He's a resentment-filled monster and an ideal
distillation of the soul-crushing institution with which Osborne's
drama is obsessed, the British class system.
</P>
<P>
   The conjuring of the ``sickness'' of this obsolete system is the
play's most entertaining feature, and the playwright's disgust is
the source of all of its friction. In the Classic Stage revival,
though, virtually all of the tension is defused.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four leading characters, only Angelina Phillips passes
handsomely into Osborne's crumbling world. She plays Helena,
Alison's stuck-up friend, who comes to the Porters' apartment to
occupy a spare bed. Helena, it first appears, is everything Jimmy
despises about the country. She's haughty, rigid, dismissive. Ms.
Phillips has a nifty way of seeming both aloof and intrigued, a
kind of veiled threat at large in the Porter household.
</P>
<P>
   An idle threat she is not: when Alison leaves, Helena takes up
with Jimmy, revealing him for the dependent hypocrite he is. In the
play's great reversal _ a moment of surprise at the ironing board
that is, alas, undermined by Ms. Bonney _ Ms. Phillips' Helena
comes across as the most engagingly complex character of the
evening.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Graham and O'Neill, in roles originated by Mary Ure and Alan
Bates, offer fairly colorless portrayals. But then they're pretty
much defenseless against the onslaught of Rogers' Monty Pythonesque
zeal. (Given his prior success with the retiring Ned, Rogers may be
better at passive than aggressive.)
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to judge from this production how well ``Look
Back in Anger'' holds up 43 years after its celebrated London
debut. On the evidence provided by the Classic Stage Company, the
play is less an oil portrait than a Polaroid snapshot. No wonder
the set designer, Narelle Sissons, fashions a backdrop to resemble
a large, yellowing photograph, curling at the corners: the
impression the evening makes fades quickly, too.

FORD CREATES REGIONAL JOBS AND SHUFFLES ITS EXECUTIVES

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ After five years of experimenting with a complex
management structure that gave managers global responsibility for
certain functions, like worldwide small car development, Ford Motor
Co. plans to return on Jan. 1 to a more traditional organization in
which many executives will have regional responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen senior executives at Ford will change job titles then,
the auto maker announced on Friday. The management shuffle was
driven partly by concern about Ford's poor performance in Europe
and South America and partly by the company's desire to grant more
autonomy to overseas managers to groom them for top jobs later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this as a great opportunity to develop business leaders
for the 21st century,'' said David Murphy, vice president for human
resources.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Trotman, Ford's chairman and chief executive until the
end of last year, created the current system of functional
responsibility five years ago to encourage the company's sometimes
feuding bureaucratic fiefs in Europe and North America to work
together more closely.
</P>
<P>
   Trotman's management structure reflected the company's desire to
produce global cars that could be mass-produced cheaply and sold
worldwide instead of making separate models for each continental
market. But the first global car, sold as the Mondeo in Europe and
the Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique in the United States, came
out as the European and American markets were diverging. The
American versions were criticized as too small and will be replaced
next year with a car-based sport utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The new structure will create a new position unthinkable under
the old structure: vice president for European vehicle development,
to be filled by Martin R. Leach.
</P>
<P>

FOX STUDIO PULLS ITS ADVERTISING TO PUNISH HOLLYWOOD TRADE PAPER
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Like many relationships in Hollywood, the one
between the trade papers _ Variety and The Hollywood Reporter _ and
the movie studios is an odd one. The papers need studio
advertisements to survive. And the studios need the trade papers to
promote their latest deals, spin the news and learn what rivals are
doing.
</P>
<P>
   In this sometimes strained symbiosis, studios hold the economic
leverage but haven't used it for years. Until last week.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual move, 20th Century Fox stopped all movie studio
advertising in The Hollywood Reporter indefinitely, a move intended
to damage the trade paper financially. Though executives at the
studio, which is owned by News Corp., insisted that the decision
was based on long-standing unhappiness with the way the trade paper
was covering Fox, editors at The Hollywood Reporter, and just about
everyone else in town, said that the reason for the economic
boycott was simple: studio anger at the caustic comments in the
newspaper about the new Fox film ``Fight Club,'' which opened on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is a violent fantasy about men who pummel each other
and go to physical extremes because they view their lives as
miserable.
</P>
<P>
   What enraged Fox executives were two Hollywood Reporter articles
about the movie in the last two weeks. One brief article, written
by Anita M. Busch, the newspaper's editor, and Thom Geier, a
reporter, said that the openings of the film in Los Angeles and New
York had been disastrous. Producers and agents were quoted,
anonymously, as saying the big-budget movie was ``loathsome,''
``absolutely indefensible'' and ``deplorable on every level.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in a prominently displayed column, Ms. Busch said
that the movie ``has drawn more gut anger from the industry than
I've ever heard.'' Ms. Busch added: ``And for good reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Busch said that the film ``will become Washington's poster
child for what's wrong with Hollywood. And Washington, for once,
will be right.'' She wrote: ``The film is exactly the kind of
product that lawmakers should target for being socially
irresponsible in a nation that has deteriorated to the point of
Columbine,'' a reference to the high-school shootings in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Fox followed with an economic boycott. Several rival studio
marketing chiefs said that Fox would never take such a step against
a big newspaper like The Times Mirror Co.'s Los Angeles Times,
which printed a devastating review of the movie on Friday but is
hardly as vulnerable to studio pressures as a trade paper.
</P>
<P>
   And they said that because the studio had taken pride in the
movie's provocative nature, and admitted that it would polarize
audiences, Fox should not respond angrily to condemnations of
``Fight Club.'' ``It's part of the bargain to get attacked when you
make this kind of movie,'' one marketing executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Dowling, the publisher and editor in chief of the
newspaper, told his staff at a Monday meeting that Fox had warned
him of ``consequences'' as a result of the ``Fight Club'' coverage,
according to a participant. The potential loss of hundreds of
thousands of dollars for The Hollywood Reporter could have a direct
impact on raises, bonuses, travel and other contingencies, people
close to the newspaper said. The paper is owned by the Dutch
company VNU, which also owns trade magazines like Billboard and
Adweek.
</P>
<P>
   Dowling and Ms. Busch declined to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, the message sent to The Hollywood Reporter,
and its rival, Variety, which is owned by Reed Elsevier Inc., was
unmistakable. Both newspapers depend for their survival on nearly a
dozen film studios and production companies and, to a lesser
degree, television network advertising. In fact, the trade papers
earn a hefty share of their income from November to January, during
the Academy Award season. That's when studios with Oscar-hopeful
films spend as much as $700,000, and perhaps far more, on campaigns
in each of the trade newspapers. Television studios may also allot
about $300,000 a year in trade paper advertising, mostly for the
Emmys, though HBO spends far more.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, both newspapers earn hundreds of thousands of
dollars a year on ads placed by studios that appeal to the vanity
of stars and filmmakers by congratulating them on their newest
films and latest honorary awards.
</P>
<P>
   The last time a Hollywood studio used leverage against a trade
paper was in 1992, when Paramount stopped advertising in The
Hollywood Reporter for at least four months after a series of
articles that said, essentially, that the studio was using
exploitative advertisements for the film ``Juice,'' about Harlem
teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, Paramount took another unusual step. A studio
spokesman said Paramount, now a unit of Viacom, would halt all
company advertisements in Variety because of a scathing review of
the film ``Patriot Games.'' The editor of Variety, Peter Bart, sent
a letter to Paramount executives, saying that the review, by Joseph
McBride, ``was, to put it in a word, unprofessional,'' and that the
critic ``will not review any more Paramount films.'' Bart later
said the review was politically biased and did not address the
artistic merits of the film, which negatively portrayed the Irish
Republican Army. McBride later left the newspaper. Eventually, the
advertising issue faded, though Bart said that the studio actually
never stopped advertising.
</P>
<P>
   But the studios learned the limits of their power in 1993. At
the time, The Los Angeles Times was told by Columbia Studios, owned
by Sony, that it was not welcome and that the studio was weighing a
halt of its advertising in the newspaper, then $5 million a year.
The reason? A Times article said that a research screening with
poor results had taken place of ``Last Action Hero.'' The studio
said no such screening took place.
</P>
<P>
   The studio demanded a correction and an assurance that the
journalist who wrote the story would no longer cover the studio.
The newspaper held its ground. Within a few days, the issue
fizzled. Michael Cieply, a producer at the studio, termed it ``a
tempest in an Evian bottle.''

ADVERTISING: AN AMBITIOUS WEB PROJECT BY THE FOUR A'S 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The trade organization representing the nation's advertising
agencies is planning one of its most ambitious projects ever,
providing information online about members that could help them
land new clients.
</P>
<P>
   The American Association of Advertising Agencies, known as the
Four A's, plans to announce Monday its sponsorship of what is
intended to be a nonpartisan, nonprofit database devoted to new
business. The purpose is to assist marketers considering or
conducting account reviews as well as agency search consultants who
work for marketers on such reviews by making it easier for them to
learn about member agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to set up a central resource balanced for all
agencies, a level playing field,'' said Cleve Langton, executive
vice president and director for worldwide business development at
DDB Worldwide Communications Group in New York, owned by Omnicom
Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``This big step forward is the logical outgrowth of everything
we've been doing the last two years,'' said Langton, referring to
the new business committee of the Four A's, which he heads as
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's work has included issuing guidelines to govern
conduct during reviews and creating a standardized questionnaire to
gather information from agencies taking part in reviews. Those
steps were in response to what many agency executives perceive as
inequities in the search process, particularly the increasing power
of the independent search consultants who collect data about agency
operations during the reviews they oversee.
</P>
<P>
   The Four A's database ``is not meant to compete with or be in
conflict with consultants,'' said Peter Drakoulias, a member of the
new business committee who is a partner and director for business
development at Deutsch Inc. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is based on what the Web is all about, providing as much
information to as many people as you can,'' he added. ``And the
fact that it's `brought to you by' the Four A's makes it fair and
unbiased.''
</P>
<P>
   One search consultant is skeptical of the new venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome any additional source of information to help
clients profile agencies,'' said Skip Pile, chairman of Pile &AMP; Co.
in Boston, ``but it feels a little adversarial and redundant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Picking an agency using an online membership directory,'' said
Pile, who also sponsors an agency database (www.agencycompile.com),
``is like trying to pick an architect by using the yellow pages.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that Pile's Web site is just one of several similar
services, both nonprofit and commercial, already dedicated to
account reviews and new business, should the Four A's project have
a Web address of www.toolittletoolate.org?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' said O. Burtch Drake, president and chief
executive of the agency association in New York. ``It's important
that the industry have a site.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been doing a lot of work in the new business area,'' he
added, referring to projects like the guidelines and the
questionnaire. ``The Four A's new business Web site takes our
efforts to ease the agency search process to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   Four A's members will be charged one-time fees ranging from $500
to $5,000 _ based on agency gross income _ to defray the start-up
costs of the Web site, Drake said, adding that the association
would ``put in some of our own money, too.'' Drake estimated the
start-up costs at $250,000; Pile said it cost ``roughly a million
bucks'' to get his site up and running.
</P>
<P>
   To build and maintain the Four A's database, members of the new
business committee selected a fledgling New York agency named
Little Tornadoes. The decision came after _ yes, a review.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really felt like a client,'' said Joanne Davis, a committee
member who is managing partner at Bozell Group in New York, a unit
of True North Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, was it exciting to be on the other side,'' she added. ``I
particularly liked asking, `Are you the people who will work on our
account?'''
</P>
<P>
   One of those people, Spencer Hayman, president of Little
Tornadoes _ named for a band in which he played in college _ said:
``We made a 20-minute presentation and then spent an hour and a
half answering questions. It was like facing the Jedi Council as a
rookie knight.''
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for the new business Web site to be ready in February
or March on a section of the current Four A's Web site
(www.aaaa.org), Hayman said, as well as ``having its own unique
reference, as a `dot-com' as well as a `dot-org.'''
</P>
<P>
   Other features being considered, he added, include so-called hot
links to agencies' own Web sites and the sorting of agencies by
categories like size, location, specialty, type of clients _ even
the names of brands for which agencies create campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Hayman opened Little Tornadoes after he left Grybauskas Beatrice
in New York, where he helped start another fancifully named
interactive unit, Blue Dingo Digital. Other clients of Little
Tornadoes include British Airways, the Carnegie Endowment and
Junior's, the Brooklyn restaurant-delicatessen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working on a site to sell Junior's cheesecake,'' Hayman
said, ``which has put about an inch on my waist already.''

BEAR STEARNS AGREES TO PAY $3.5 MILLION IN BARON CASE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Bear Stearns Securities Corp., the Wall Street brokerage
firm subsidiary that processes securities transactions for
thousands of smaller firms, has agreed to pay an additional $3.5
million to cover losses incurred by customers of A.R. Baron &AMP; Co.,
a defunct brokerage firm whose trades it cleared.
</P>
<P>
   The payment settles the claims against Bear Stearns brought by
the trustee appointed to liquidate A.R. Baron. It brings to $42
million the total fines, restitution and court costs the firm has
agreed to pay in that matter.
</P>
<P>
   A.R. Baron, which went out of business in 1996, was the subject
of a three-year criminal investigation by Manhattan District
Attorney Robert Morgenthau. Calling the firm a criminal enterprise,
Morgenthau convened a grand jury in 1997 to hear evidence in the
matter and won convictions of 13 Baron officers and employees for
securities fraud. Morgenthau said $75 million had been lost by
investors who traded with Baron.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation into Baron led prosecutors to Bear Stearns
Securities, which cleared Baron's trades and provided the firm with
the capital it needed to operate. Following the investigation into
Bear Stearns' role in the Baron fraud, prosecutors and the
Securities and Exchange Commission charged the big brokerage firm
with fraud. Without admitting or denying the charges, Bear Stearns
agreed to pay $25 million to settle the case.
</P>
<P>
   James W. Giddens, a partner at Hughes Hubbard &AMP; Reed in New York
and the trustee charged with overseeing the liquidation of Baron,
demanded that Bear Stearns return all clearing fees and other funds
transferred by Baron to the giant Wall Street brokerage during the
period Bear Stearns Securities cleared Baron's trades. The trustee
said the $3.5 million settlement, which is subject to court
approval, represented a substantial portion of those funds.
</P>
<P>
   The $3.5 million payment by Bear Stearns is in addition to the
$30 million restitution fund the firm was required to establish for
former A.R. Baron customers as part of its settlement agreement
with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Manhattan
district attorney. That agreement, announced in August, also
required Bear Stearns to pay $1 million to New York state, $1
million to New York City and $1.5 million to the district
attorney's office to cover the costs of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This settlement brings us substantially closer to our goal of
paying 100 percent of the losses suffered by A.R. Baron
customers,'' Giddens said. The trustee said that customers of Baron
had submitted claims for losses estimated at more than $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Baron trustee has also brought more than 100 lawsuits
seeking $450 million from former Baron employees, insiders and
favored customers who profited through their relationship with
Baron. Those suits have yielded almost $3 million and are expected
to bring in more money that can be returned to investors who lost
money trading through Baron.
</P>
<P>
   The Bear Stearns settlement with the trustee will not affect the
individual lawsuits and arbitration cases which have been brought
against the firm for losses suffered in the Baron failure. Those
cases, as well as a class action suit, are still pending.

won, by what margin and against what quality of opposition. The
quality of an opponent is determined by examining its record
against other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Times computer model collapses runaway scores and takes note
of a home-field advantage. Recent games count more than earlier
games.
</P>
<P>
   The top team is assigned a rating of 1.000; the ratings of all
other teams are percentages reflecting their strength relative to
the top team. This week, for example, there is very little

difference between Tennessee (9) and Georgia Tech (12) is much
larger.

   No Charges in Ramsey Case
</P>
<P>
   After 13 months of grand jury testimony, the Boulder County,
Colo., district attorney decided there was not enough evidence to
indict anyone in the case of JonBenet Ramsey, the 6-year-old beauty
pageant queen who was found dead in her parents' home in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take no satisfaction in this result because a child killer
remains free and undetected,'' the parents, John and Patsy, said in
a statement, even though they had been the only real suspects in
the case.

   Big Move by Con Ed
</P>
<P>
   Consolidated Edison Inc. of New York announced plans to acquire
Northeast Utilities, the largest utility in New England, for $3.29
billion in a deal that could bring cheaper power to its customers.
Con Edison will become one of the largest utilities in the nation,
with a base of 4.7 million customers.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies want to be mainly distributors and not generators
of electricity. They are also preparing to sell electricity,
natural gas and other services to customers throughout the
Northeast as states open up their utilities to competition.

   A Nobel for Doctors' Group
</P>
<P>
   Doctors Without Borders won the Nobel Peace Prize for adhering
to ``the fundamental principle that all disaster victims, whether
the disaster is natural or human in origin, have a right to
professional assistance given as quickly and as efficiently as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The group of more than 2,000 medical professionals in 80
countries was formed in 1968 and often defied governments by
intervening without being asked.
</P>
<P>
   Among the places its volunteers have provided humanitarian aid
are Nicaragua, Vietnam, Lebanon, Afghanistan, Rwanda, Kosovo and
East Timor.

   Babbitt Inquiry Ends
</P>
<P>
   After an 18-month investigation, an independent counsel said
there was insufficient evidence to warrant charges against Interior
Secretary Bruce Babbitt or anyone else involved in a decision by
the Interior Department in 1995 to deny a permit for an Indian
gambling project in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation centered on whether Babbitt lied in
congressional testimony about the decision. The statement by the
prosecutor vindicated Babbitt, a former Arizona governor.

   Drug Arrests in Colombia

<P>
   The Justice Department said Colombia had broken that country's
biggest cocaine-trafficking ring with the arrest of the ring's
leader and other traffickers. Colombian officials pledged to
extradite the suspects back to the United States for trial. In
1991, Colombia stopped extraditions following a wave of killings
and bombings by drug cartels, but now officials are vowing to renew
the process even as they brace for possible violence.

   Clintons Get New Home Loan
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton have secured new
financing for their house in Chappaqua, N.Y. They now have a
30-year $1.36 million mortgage, with interest for three years at
7.5 percent and afterward at 2.75 percentage points over the
one-year Treasury bill rate.
</P>
<P>
   With the loan from PNC Mortgage, the First Couple no longer
needs the backing of Terry McAuliffe, a Democratic fund-raiser
whose offer of financial help had been criticized by Republicans
who said the arrangement smacked of special treatment.

   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE POP-UP BOOK OF PHOBIAS'' &QL; 
By Gary Greenberg (Morrow, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We heard about this one before we saw it, and that's always a
good sign. It has been New &AMP; Notable's policy to mock pop-up books
on the grounds that they are both silly and oxymoronic _ something
can't pop up and be a book at the same time. We prefer to think of
them as ````gadgets''.'' The last one we paid any attention to was
about golf courses, and it might have been the nadir of pop-up
books _ little greens rising at you like some dopey delusion, sand
traps floating through the air. So, when we got wind of this one,
we licked our chops, found ``moronic'' in the thesaurus and waited
for the kill. Now, we must eat crow. New &AMP; Notable has been
conquered by a pop-up book, wrestled into submission by a gadget.
Gary Greenberg, the stand-up comedian who created it, begins with
the mother of all phobias, the Dentist and the Drill. This
particular drill twists as it rises into view, and it is big enough
to roto-rooter your nostril. When it reaches dead center, it is
aimed straight at you, right at your very teeth, and behind it is a
dentist who bears more than a passing resemblance to Joseph
Mengele. You have to laugh _ what else can you do? Greenberg has
paired off the ludicrous and the macabre, and we couldn't wait to
turn the page and see what he'd do next. There are 10 phobias here,
including most of the big ones, but we won't say more. The
dentist's drill is funny whether you know it's coming or not, but
others profit from an element of surprise. Either way, phobias beat
golf courses, hands down. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``DOGS THAT KNOW WHEN THEIR OWNERS ARE COMING HOME'' &QL; 
By Rupert Sheldrake (Crown, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Surely, Sheldrake is preaching to the converted when he makes
the case for studying our own pets (and not just creatures in
research labs) to foster our awareness of ``the unexplained powers
of animals.'' After all, the people most likely to buy his book are
those who agree with him, who object to our longstanding taboo
against taking pets seriously. There's nevertheless something
heartwarming about his arguments, which embrace the animals we love
as both gifted creatures and sources of scientific knowledge.
Through interviews and surveys with pet owners, veterinarians, dog
trainers and zoo keepers in the United States and Britain,
Sheldrake explores the phenomenon of telepathic communication
between people and animals _ in other words, he asks why a dog
might know 20 minutes in advance that its owner is coming home,
even when the owner is unexpected. Or how a cat hearing a ringing
telephone would know that someone it loves is on the other end of
the line. What makes an animal show unmistakable signs of agitation
a full three hours before an earthquake, or enables a horse to find
its way home across unfamiliar terrain? And why, if there are some
dogs that know their owners are coming home, are there other dogs
that don't have a clue? Are some breeds more sensitive than others?
Sheldrake explores animal empathy, the therapeutic effect of pets,
animal-to-animal telepathy, the phenomenon of bird migration, and
animal premonitions. His book is an engaging look at domesticated
creatures and the mysterious things that connect us to them. &QL; 
``PLAINSONG'' &QL; 
By Kent Haruf (Knopf, $24) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This lovely, evocative novel is set in Holt, Colo., a prairie
town so small that it takes only an hour for two boys to deliver
all of its newspapers. Those boys are Ike and Bobby Guthrie, whose
father, Tom, teaches history at the high school, and whose mother,
Ella, has taken silently to her bed and will soon move out of the
house and then out of town altogether. Other characters are
Victoria Roubideaux, a pregnant teenage girl whose mother has
locked her out of the house, and the senior McPheron brothers, two
self-described decrepit old bachelors who agree to let Victoria
come and live with them on their farm until her baby is born. Haruf
lets his characters reveal themselves slowly and compassionately,
and the story that takes shape as the ties between them grow is
oddly comforting even as they grapple with changes in their lives.
The feel of this book is not unlike that of Cormac McCarthy's later
novels, both in tone and in the atmospheric sense of place that
becomes almost a character in itself (missing is McCarthy's
trademark violence, although there is one menacing scene in which
Ike and Bobby are roughed up by a teenage bully). Haruf has written
a quietly moving book about ordinary people dealing with the
emotional twists of ordinary life. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``BROTHERS'' &QL; 
(Hyperion, $26.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Writing about my brothers is a dangerous occupation, dancing
through a minefield,'' Frank McCourt says. Maybe so, but there's
something to be said for having tissues on hand if you intend to
read this book _ you might get weepy. There are some fine writers
here _ McCourt, Tobias Wolff, Richard Ford, David Sedaris, James
Alan McPherson _ all talking about their brothers and the bonds and
conflicts between them. We were most taken, however, with the essay
by Charles P. Pierce, who is the son of a brother and the father of
brothers, but who himself is an only child. His is the clear-eyed
view from beyond: ``I have watched brothers all my life,'' he says.
``I watched them in my family growing up, and I watch my children
today, the blood speech of the code-talkers in the other bedrooms,
the swift bursts of anger and the reconciliations, all operating on
rules as foreign and distant to me as Hammurabi's Code.'' Mixed
with these essays are portraits of brothers, some well-known (the
Dalai Lama and his brother, Martin Scorsese and his), some not at
all. This was put together by the editors of ``Esquire.'' &QL;

   &UR; Jane Smiley &LR; , a novelist who says she doesn't wear makeup and
doesn't have ``any gowns, bikinis, pink high heels, floral
accessories or feminine furniture,'' is a Barbie doll believer.
Smiley's two daughters were big Barbie fans, she writes in a
``Barbie Chronicles'' essay reprinted in Ladies' Home Journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my daughters were to learn certain Hollywood inspired
essentials of American womanhood, it wasn't going to be from me,
but from Barbie.'' Barbie is every girl's traditional heroine,
claims Smiley: Nancy Drew, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and Beauty
of ``Beauty and the Beast.'' All TV and movie blondes are Barbies,
as is the prettiest girl in school. ``A girl has to have a Barbie
doll in order to decide whether she herself wants to be a Barbie.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbie represents instant gratification, and every Barbie is
sooner or later discarded, writes Smiley. Barbie isn't cuddly;
she's built to be toyed with, manipulated. ``All this aids in a
girl's making up her mind about who she is and what she wants. That
Barbie is a genius.''

   Bear Stearns Securities to Pay $3.5 Million More

   Bear Stearns Securities, which processes securities transactions
for thousands of smaller firms, has agreed to pay an additional
$3.5 million to cover losses incurred by customers of A.R. Baron, a
defunct brokerage firm whose trades it cleared.
</P>

   A `Fight Club' Counterpunch
</P>
<P>
   In the sometimes strained symbiosis between Hollywood studios
and the trade papers Variety and The Hollywood Reporter, the
studios hold the economic leverage but haven't used it for years.
Until last week. In an unusual move, 20th Century Fox stopped all
studio advertising in The Hollywood Reporter indefinitely because
of caustic comments about the new Fox film ``Fight Club.'' One
article, written by Anita Busch, the newspaper's editor, and Thom
Geier, a reporter, said that the openings of the film in Los
Angeles and New York had been disastrous. And in a column, Ms.
Busch said that the film ``will become Washington's poster child
for what's wrong with Hollywood. And Washington, for once, will be
right.''

   Just as the Unix computer operating system once promised to be

<P>
   MOSCOW _ The American who brought consumer capitalism to Russia
40 years ago came back for a visit last week _ to reports of
bribery and money laundering, to a Mercedesful of impeccably suited
thugs, to political wars among the lap-dog newspapers and
television networks of too-wealthy tycoons, to throngs of street
urchins and trash bin-miners trampled in the stampede to wealth.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, he said, it could have been worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The changes are unbelievable,'' said Donald M. Kendall.
``People keep talking about crime and corruption and not about the
amazing things that have happened here. You can't believe the
merchandise in the stores and the shopping centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go out on the street and look at the traffic jams, at the
cars. They're not just Mercedes. The changes here go deeper than
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even to dream about such things a decade ago, he said, ``would
have been absolutely impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   It is tempting to many to write off Russia's experiment with
capitalism thus far as a waste of a decade, or even a net loss.
Kendall is that rarest of Americans, not to mention native
Muscovites: someone who still believes the Russian glass is half
full.
</P>
<P>
   More specifically, he believes it is half full of Pepsi-Cola.
For Kendall will forever be known for making Pepsi the first
American consumer product on Soviet restaurant menus and store
shelves.
</P>
<P>
   As a rising executive at the Pepsi-Cola Corp. in 1959, Kendall
bucked his elders and set up fountain dispensers at Moscow's
Sokolniki Park, where the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev and Vice
President Richard Nixon were about to christen the first American
trade exhibition ever held in the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Nixon the night before, at the embassy, and told him
I was in a lot of trouble at home because people thought I was
wasting Pepsi's money coming to a communist country,'' Kendall said
the other night at a Moscow reception sponsored by the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that somehow, I had to get a Pepsi in Khrushchev's
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall got far more than he could have imagined. The next day,
Sokolniki was the scene of the famous finger-wagging ``kitchen
debate'' between Khrushchev and Nixon. Kendall now recalls
watching, transfixed, as the two men verbally slugged it out over
the merits of capitalism and communism.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-left-hook, Nixon steered Khrushchev to the Pepsi pavilion
for sips of cola, some made with American water and some with
Russian. Khrushchev declared the Moscow version clearly superior
and ordered everyone around him to partake.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi reaped a publicity windfall the company's elders never
expected. Kendall became CEO in 1965. A decade later he negotiated
a monopoly for Pepsi on cola sales with Khrushchev's successors
that stood until the Soviet Union fell eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And Kendall, who was merely seeking a toehold on a market his
arch-nemesis, Coca-Cola, had not penetrated, discovered something
more: an affinity for Russia that has become a personal cause, and
a conviction that however bad things seem now, they will get
better.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, his presence in Moscow last week for a slightly
belated celebration of the July anniversary of the Sokolniki event,
may have been a tonic. Although the occasion was marked by a
banquet in the Kremlin Palace and speeches by the American
ambassador, James Collins, and others, it is safe to say that
neither side feels like celebrating.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, burned by Russia's 1998 economic crash and
intimidated by the scale of corruption, have reined in their
business dealings here. Russians feel humiliated by privation and
are seething over the American brouhaha about corruption _ a
problem they say Americans ignored as long as it benefited them.
</P>
<P>
   One of those Russians, Georgi Arbatov, dined last week with
Kendall, Anatoly Dobrynin, the former Russian ambassador to the
United States, and other veterans of the Pepsi era of good feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Arbatov, a familiar face to cold war Americans as director of
the Institute for U.S.A.-Canada Studies, takes a more dyspeptic
view of things. Kendall is a friend and a smart businessman, he
said in an interview last week, but his analysis of Russia's future
is distinctly rose-colored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shock therapy was a complete disaster for Russia,'' Arbatov
said, using the shorthand for the effort to convert Russia
overnight to a capitalist system. ``There is tremendous
polarization. On one side people have luxury cars and overseas bank
accounts; on the other living standards have dropped tremendously.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were tremendously ideological. Ideology was like a
religion. And suddenly, we lost the ideology, and the only god that
exists is the greenback.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall allowed that it is important to acknowledge the
failures, and just as important to remember that the United States
also has had its share of robber-baron tycoons, mafias, economic
panics and corruption scandals.
</P>
<P>
   Now retired for 13 years as the head of Pepsico Inc., Kendall is
president of the East-West Institute, an organization broadly
devoted to better understanding and relationships between Russia
and the West. In that capacity, he argues that turning one's back
on Russia at its low point would be a huge mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always convinced that we had to open this place up
instead of isolating it, and I still am,'' he said. ``It's going to
come out in the end because they've got a younger generation here
that's well-educated and doesn't want to go back to the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as he was in 1959, Kendall is in the minority. Asked what
lies in Russia's immediate future, for example, Arbatov said
simply, ``Nothing good.'' Still, he acknowledged that he has been
mistaken before. ``I was at Sokolniki that day, with my wife and my
boy, and we tasted Pepsi-Cola,'' he said. ``And I must tell you _
almost none of the Russians liked it.''

A KILLING SHOCKS JAMAICANS INTO SOUL-SEARCHING 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINGSTON, Jamaica _ When robbers murdered an 85-year-old woman
in her Kingston home in August, what has become a routine crime in
violent Jamaica soon had extraordinary repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   For the victim was Rose Leon, a successful businesswoman and
former Cabinet member, and her death set off a wave of confessions:
not by sullen-faced killers, but by Jamaican politicians suddenly
eager to apologize for creating a culture that encouraged violence
as a campaign tactic and self-interest as a ruling tenet.
</P>
<P>
   Men armed by rival parties turned grass-roots politics into
block-by-block warfare in the 1970s and 1980s. The politicians no
longer control the gunmen, but many Jamaicans lament today's random
criminal chaos as the sorry legacy of the turbulent rivalry between
the Jamaica Labor Party and the People's National Party.
</P>
<P>
   Rose Leon was a beloved figure whose own political career
spanned decades of service to both parties. So, when a stunned
nation anguished over her murder, the grief also touched off a
spontaneous act of contrition from the widow of former Prime
Minister Michael Manley.
</P>
<P>
   Beverley Anderson Manley, a host of ``The Breakfast Club,'' a
radio talk show, gave voice to what many people had quietly
thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the middle of paying tribute to her, I said that anything
that I might have done that in any way contributed to what Jamaica
is today, wittingly or unwittingly, that I totally apologize to the
Jamaican people,'' she said. ``I thought about how we got to a
stage where you could have not only a woman prominent in society
but also an elderly woman, an icon who served our country, be
killed by some young guys. How did we get into such a stage of
anarchy? I knew the nature of our politics. I was married to a
party leader. I couldn't say I didn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Her candor prompted her co-host, Anthony Abrahams, who was a
minister of tourism and information in the administration of
Manley's rival, former Prime Minister Edward Seaga, to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   Abrahams said he was willing to talk about troubling events
during his long association with Seaga's Jamaica Labor Party,
provided he was given immunity. Next, Dudley Thompson, a former
minister of national security, came on the show and apologized for
his 1978 comments about the Green Bay Massacre, where soldiers
killed several suspected gang members. Thompson, who became
security minister shortly after the killings, had said then that
``no angels died at Green Bay.'' Later, he learned that the victims
had been set up and lured to their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Insofar as those words mean I approve of the killings, I
abjectly apologize,'' he said. ``But it is an apology for something
I said, not a confession for something I did. Whoever did it has to
make their own confession.''
</P>
<P>
   Other mea culpas _ more minima than maxima _ have followed,
although few details of past misdeeds have emerged.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The confessional wave has caught enough of the nation's
imagination to prompt a call for a truth and reconciliation
commission along the lines of that in South Africa, so politicians
can account and atone for the past and usher in a new era.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were part of the process,'' Abrahams said. ``We are part of
a failed state and as such we failed the country. With all the
opportunity I had, I just slipped into the political system without
really bucking it.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has yet to propose just how a truth commission would come
into being, much less function. So far, Prime Minister P.J.
Patterson and Seaga have rejected any such panel, saying that their
parties have corrected their errors and that there are more
pressing issues facing the country than to rehash the past.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a coalition of religious leaders sponsored a national
``Bawl Out'' this month to denounce the violence and corruption of
the past. And Carolyn Gomes, a pediatrician who helped establish
Jamaicans for Justice, an advocacy group that is studying how such
a commission would work, said the people were capable of deciding
for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the country is desperate for some voice of truth and
accountability,'' she said. ``You can't begin a process of healing
until you admit the truth and stop finger pointing.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The confessions have spawned accusations. Abrahams' radio show
started questioning events under the Seaga administration, most
recently his party's generous help with a failed agricultural
project that was run by a reputed Israeli mobster who was later
convicted in South Florida of money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Swiftly, the wall across the street from where the show is
broadcast was spray painted with taunts cryptically suggesting that
the hosts have some secrets they may want to keep hidden. Abrahams
dismissed the graffiti and innuendo as the kind of assault too long
accepted in Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear there has been a tribal nature to the politics,''
he said. ``In Jamaica, if a politician is caught doing something
wrong, all he has to do is think of somebody on the other side who
did something similar and that's the end of the argument.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Whether the debate generates more than radio ratings remains
uncertain. Trevor Munroe, a political scientist who has also
apologized for his role in advising the doomed government of
Grenada's prime minister, Maurice Bishop, said the discussion has
emerged too quickly, without any sort of consultation or
legislative guidance. He contrasted it with the South African
process, which grew out of that nation's transitional constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reflected reconciliation at the highest level in terms of
power sharing and that is a different process than confession as a
means of recrimination,' he said. ``I don't think the confession
process here was preceded by any amount of networking. Here we
began more spontaneously, hence it added a new dimension, political
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters are skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're in an environment where politicians are lambasted all
over the place,'' said Aeden Earle, an earth scientist. ``They want
to position themselves as part of the new political breed. They
want to distance themselves from the violence of the '70s, so they
make a half-hearted confession and say they're man enough to admit
to it. It's an attempt to prolong their credibility over the medium
term.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Levy, an insurance company manager, said the commission
was a good idea, but he saw it vanishing with each day of partisan
accusations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lost opportunity,'' he said. ``I don't think people
understand half of the rottenness in our politics. And they need to
understand it.''

`STORYTELLERS': A DAVID BOWIE WHO TAKES IT LIGHTLY
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Broadcast notes are at end of review. Check local listings
for broadcast time in your area.) 
(rk) 
 By RON WERTHEIMER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Bowie, that fey chameleon of pop music, has metamorphosed
into a giggly middle-aged man in clunky boots and an oversize
sweatshirt. At least that's the character he has elected to offer
as himself for the latest segment of the VH1 series
``Storytellers.''
</P>
<P>
   Light years from Ziggy Stardust, Bowie settles comfortably into
the show's format, an informal and-then-I-wrote monologue
punctuated with songs that recall a few phases of his varied
30-year career. In place of the sexually charged poseur of the
past, Monday night's hour presents a bemused, self-deprecating
52-year-old survivor who moves lightly from anecdote to tune,
backed by a smoothly professional band and the sound of synthesized
strings.
</P>
<P>
   The young instrumentalists, backup singers and audience members
all gaze at him reverentially. But even if you know that Bowie
carries the credentials of an international icon, it's hard to
understand from the evidence at hand what all the fuss was about.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was about 14,'' Bowie says, ``Eartha Kitt and D.H.
Lawrence were some of my favorite bedtime reading.'' This
revelation helps introduce one of Bowie's recent songs, called
``Thursday's Child,'' which was also the title of Ms. Kitt's
autobiography. (No, there is no ballad here about Lady Chatterley.)
Hearing ``Child'' and another ``song of newness,'' as Bowie puts
it, ``Seven'' (``I've got seven days to live my life or seven ways
to die''), you can conclude that his current passion is for
easy-listening anthems. No more scary monsters?
</P>
<P>
   The dark complexities of the past are acknowledged at the show's
end, when Bowie sings ``Word on a Wing,'' from his ``Station to
Station'' album of 1976. Those were ``singularly the darkest days
of my life,'' he says, and the song ``was a call for help.''
</P>
<P>
   Recalling it now, however, he can't help smiling. And like the
Cheshire cat's, Bowie's smile is what lingers when he's gone. In
close-up, it is infectious, something that can't quite be shared in
a recording or concert. Television does have its uses.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: DESIGN FANTASIES FOR A STRIP OF MANHATTAN'S WEST
SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are only three more days to see an exhibition
of new designs for the redevelopment of the far West Side of
mid-Manhattan. I strongly urge you to see the show, on display
through Wednesday in Vanderbilt Hall, the former waiting room at
Grand Central Terminal. The five proposals on view are not
uniformly great, but each is packed with intelligence, energy and
pure, raw city love. And one, by the British architect Cedric
Price, is a gem.
</P>
<P>
   The designs are finalists in a competition conceived by Phyllis
Lambert, founding director of the Canadian Center for Architecture
in Montreal. Every three years the competition (officially titled
the International Foundation for the Canadian Center for
Architecture Prize for the Design of Cities) will address the needs
of a different city. New York was the chosen site for the inaugural
year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Price, the architects chosen to compete include
Thom Mayne of Santa Monica, Calif.; Jesse Reiser and Nanako Umemoto
of New York, and Ben van Berkel and Caroline Bos of Amsterdam.
Peter Eisenman of New York won the competition and its $100,000
prize with a design developed with David Childs of Skidmore, Owings
&AMP; Merrill.
</P>
<P>
   The site for the competition is a 20-block strip of Manhattan
that stretches from Eighth Avenue west to the Hudson River and is
bound on the south by 30th Street and on the north by 34th.
Included in the area is the General Post Office, formally known as
the James A. Farley Building, which is scheduled to become the new
Pennsylvania Station. Much of the site is occupied by a tangle of
transportation infrastructure: train tracks, highway overpasses,
tunnel entrances and bus parking.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition at Grand Central can be seen as an effort to fill
the void left by the collapse of city planning in New York in
recent decades. It is far from certain that architects are
qualified to fill this vacuum, but it has become reasonably clear
that local community boards aren't up to the task. Community
activists can be highly effective at preventing projects from
disrupting neighborhoods, but they have little interest in
fostering new architecture of character and no reason to think
about the vitality of the public realm beyond their own backyards.
</P>
<P>
   Reactivating the public realm is the express concern of these
five designs. How to draw people in? What combination of functions
and forms can create a sense of place and a sense of time? The
architectural teams are not your usual cast of warm, fuzzy people
pleasers. No Hugh Hardy, no David Rockwell, no Jon Jerde. Rather,
with the exception of Price, the competitors are known primarily as
formalists. They set great stock in the pure esthetics of design,
and their designs tend toward the cool and experimental.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of these architects was clearly polemic. At a time
when New York is stuck in the formulaic belief that the only way to
attract people is by creating ersatz versions of the past, the
competition's organizers hoped to stimulate innovative ideas for
structuring social space.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately Rem Koolhaas, the Dutch architect, chose not to
compete. But most of the projects on view display Koolhaas'
influence, if not in form then in scale. His concept of bigness,
advocated in his 1995 book ``S, M, L, XL,'' is the ruling principle
that enables these architects to justify what are, in essence,
megastructures: oversize buildings that contain an urban array of
functions. Too, Koolhaas' firm, the Office for Metropolitan
Architecture, established in 1975, has long advocated the expansion
of architecture's sphere of influence over urban planning.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Price, the finalists share some common
traits. All use curves or waves to set the site area off from the
surrounding regularity of the Manhattan grid. With varying degrees
of looseness, they adopt the megastructural approach: bringing
together urban activities within a large, comprehensive
architectural framework.
</P>
<P>
   The dense mix of functions _ offices, apartments, parks, indoor
recreation, sports stadiums, shops _ corresponds to what Koolhaas
has called New York's ``culture of congestion.'' But it also holds
appeal for developers eager to squeeze the last economic drop out
of the city's limited land.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps New Yorkers will be most interested in the scheme
proposed by Eisenman. I plan to write about this design later,
along with another recent competition-winning proposal by Eisenman:
a new cultural center for the Spanish pilgrimage town Santiago de
Compostela. But I left Grand Central thinking that Price's design
is the one that best deserves our attention before the exhibition
closes.
</P>
<P>
   Price, 65, is not well known in this country, but he has been a
legendary figure in British architectural circles since the 1960s.
His best-known project is the unbuilt Fun Palace, designed with the
theatrical impresario Joan Littlewood in 1962. The work exerted
considerable influence over the development of ``high tech''
architecture in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The Georges Pompidou Center in Paris, designed by Richard Rogers
and Renzo Piano in 1971, is clearly descended from Price's Fun
Palace. And his palace is also an ancestor of the megastructural
approach adopted by most of the finalists in New York.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Price, however, has taken a very different route here. Playing a
game of one-upmanship, his plan is as mortifying as only an
Englishman knows how to be. In the Grand Central exhibition,
allegedly avant-garde architects are falling all over themselves
trying to show that they can outdo the developers on the
developers' terms, and Price just strolls casually onto the site as
if he were hiking across a moor, takes a few deep breaths and says:
``Oh, no. It would be best if we didn't build here at all. Instead
of building, we ought to be thinking about taking things down.''
Another deep breath. ``We'll call it `A Lung for Midtown
Manhattan.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Price's ``lung'' essentially treats the site as a rectangular
nature preserve. Train tracks would remain uncovered. New
development would be banned. Over time some existing buildings
would be eliminated. The site would be marked with a sparkling
covering composed of small glass spheres.
</P>
<P>
   The east and west boundaries would be fitted with tunnel-like
structures that Price calls sleeves. These would be places people
could go in any weather to contemplate views of the city and the
river. They would also channel air from the river into the heart of
the city. A third observation post would be created by excising two
floors from an existing building that straddles the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Price's one-upmanship style extends to his mode of presentation.
Instead of the glamorous computer renderings used by the other
contestants, he offers rough pencil sketches that look as if they
could have been dashed off on napkins between sips of claret. Even
the term sleeves evokes drop-dead informality: custom tailoring of
such exquisite refinement that a jacket turns out looking utterly
shapeless.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the truth is that this design is really the only one of the
five that reaches beyond the formal qualities of architecture to
deal with the quality of urban life. Price's chief concern, very
simply, is with public health. It aims to improve the air, the
amount of available light and the psychological release that open
space provides. It is, in effect, a park in which the archaeology
of the industrial city takes the place of pastoral landscaping.
</P>
<P>
   The design probably never stood a chance of winning. It can't
pass for practical. City officials had already defined the site as
the city's next great development corridor. But the idea of
practicality is completely relative in this context. None of the
projects are officially authorized. None have clients. The quality
they project is not reality, but rather realness, to employ a term
coined by uptown drag queens. They are practicality impersonators,
developers en travesti.
</P>
<P>
   Price chose not to go along with the impersonation. No massive
new construction. No sports stadiums. No urban bone crunching. No
high-tech structural calisthenics. No hay to be made. Just a light
dusting of glass frosting and a breeze blowing from the river. Just
a place for a city to breathe.

<P>
   The asthma epidemic visited Children's National Medical Center
one recent Friday, the day after a furious rainstorm kicked up
allergens all over Washington. By 9 a.m., the emergency room, where
children come in more often for failing lungs than for broken
bones, was jumping. Harried nurses barked orders for the pharmacy
to send more drugs. In bed after bed, young faces, all
African-American, were buried under clear plastic breathing masks.
</P>
<P>
   John Thompson, a skinny, bright-eyed 8-year-old, was there,
watching Richard Scarry videos while sniffing steroids to relax his
swollen airways. His mother, who had taken a bus and three subway
trains to get to the hospital, lost her pay that day. She had
already used all her sick leave to care for two asthmatic children.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Mosley, an athletic 13-year-old with a mouthful of braces,
rested quietly in a room around the corner; he had woken up at 4
that morning, gasping for breath.
</P>
<P>
   Next door to Kyle lay Burnell Ramsey II, 9. He was weak,
frightened and curled up in the fetal position under a thin white
hospital sheet. His worried father gently stroked the boy's
forehead after a nurse said Burnell's lungs had partly collapsed.
His mother wept softly as a doctor tried to comfort her; the doctor
had made it all the way through medical school with asthma, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the other inner-city epidemic: asthma. The burden of
AIDS on the poor and minorities has been well documented. Asthma is
less deadly; it claims about 5,000 lives in the United States each
year. Yet the death statistics do not begin to tell the story of
how an unprecedented _ and unexplained _ explosion in asthma cases
is suffocating the nation's poorest urban residents, especially
children.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid rise of asthma, in this country and in developed
nations around the world, is one of the biggest mysteries in modern
medicine. The most striking increases, experts say, have occurred
in Australia, where about one-quarter of all children have received
a diagnosis of asthma.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the number of asthma sufferers has more
than doubled from 6.7 million in 1980 to an estimated 17.3 million
in 1998, according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta. Of these, 4.8 million are children. Experts
say the increase is real. Although doctors do a better job of
diagnosing asthma now than they did in years past, that does not
entirely explain the upward trend.
</P>
<P>
   The epidemic cuts across racial and socioeconomic lines; white
youngsters who live in suburbs are hardly exempt. The prevalence of
asthma is slightly higher among blacks than among whites.
Scientists suspect that the difference may be explained at least in
part by genetics.
</P>
<P>
   But when public health officials measure rates of hospital
admissions, emergency-room visits and deaths, they find that black
and Hispanic patients, particularly those who are poor, shoulder a
much heavier burden.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows why the disparity is so great, but experts have
some ideas. The poor tend to have less access to regular medical
care, are less able to afford the medications they need and are
more likely to be around environmental ``triggers'' that set off
asthma attacks. Also, some researchers have found, families already
under great stress are less able to cope with the complicated daily
regimen that asthma demands.
</P>
<P>
   Asthma, a chronic, incurable disease of the airways, is
characterized by intermittent episodes of wheezing, coughing and
breathlessness. During normal breathing, air flows freely in and
out of the lungs. But during an asthma attack, the lining of the
airways swells, muscles around the airways tighten and mucus clogs
the tiny air tubes in the lungs, making breathing difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks can be set off by pollen, dust and dust mites,
cockroaches, stress, cold air, tobacco smoke, irritating chemical
smells, mold and mildew, respiratory infections and exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Asthma sufferers can live a normal, unrestricted life, doctors
say, if they get the proper medication and stick to the daily
treatment and monitoring that the disease requires. But many
patients do not get the medical supervision they need or do not
follow their drug regimens properly, and so, despite new and highly
effective drugs to treat the disease, hospital admissions for
asthma are increasing.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, there were 15,000 hospital admissions of
children 14 and younger for asthma in 1997 _ the last year for
which figures were available _ up from 9,275 in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   At Children's National Medical Center, Dr. Ben Gitterman,
director of ambulatory and community pediatrics, sees these
statistics in his practice. ``We are seeing lots and lots of kids
with lots and lots of asthma,'' Gitterman said. ``We are seeing
kids on more treatments who have more access to medications, but
they're sick.''
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, the patients are members of minorities. In
1995, the most recent year for which the government has figures,
blacks were two to three times as likely to die of asthma as
whites. That same year, African-Americans paid four times as many
visits to emergency rooms for asthma as did whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very concerning,'' said Dr. David Satcher, the U.S.
surgeon general. Referring to his office's year 2000 goals for
improving the nation's health, Satcher said, ``Asthma is one of the
areas where we are moving in the wrong direction.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to reverse the trends, the government is stepping
up asthma research. In May, Donna Shalala, the secretary of health
and human services, announced that the department would develop ``a
strategic plan'' for research into the causes of asthma and ways to
lessen the burden on minorities and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   In his proposed budget for next year, President Clinton has
included $50 million in grants for states to test methods for
improving the health of children with asthma who are enrolled in
the Medicaid program. That is in addition to the $118 million the
National Institutes of Health plan to spend on asthma research.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Clinton administration has made eliminating racial
disparities in disease one of its health priorities, asthma is not
on the list of six illnesses the government has identified for the
first five years of the program. That is not because the racial gap
is insignificant, the surgeon general said, but because experts
have no idea how to narrow it within the five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the real issues is: Why are we seeing this increase in
asthma? And we don't know the answer to that,'' Satcher said.
``Until you understand why you have the increase, and you have
documented it, it is very hard to say you have a strategy that is
going to make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Battleground
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the disparity more evident than in the Bronx and
Harlem, in New York City, where a recent study found that the rate
of hospitalization for asthma was 21 times higher than that in more
affluent parts of the city, a disparity that surprised even experts
who are familiar with asthma trends.
</P>
<P>
   Here, school nurses run six-week asthma education classes for
8-year-olds, and enrollment is overflowing.
</P>
<P>
   Children routinely tuck inhalers, the little pumps that convert
asthma medication into an inhalable mist, into their backpacks so
they can take puffs before gym class. (Asthma is so prevalent that
some states, including New York, have begun passing laws allowing
children to carry the medication with a doctor's permission,
bypassing the usual requirement that drugs be administered by a
nurse.)
</P>
<P>
   At the Bilingual Bicultural Mini School on 109th Street in East
Harlem, the medicine cabinet in the nurse's office is filled with
inhalers, and two nebulizers _ machines that administer emergency
breathing treatments _ are tucked in a corner, just below an asthma
awareness poster.
</P>
<P>
   Ann-Nancy Murphy, a nurse practitioner from Mount Sinai Medical
Center who works at the public elementary school under a pediatric
health program, said she needs both machines; sometimes two
children have emergencies at once.
</P>
<P>
   The school's director, Lourdes Arroyo, says some students miss
as much as four weeks of school each year because of asthma, which
she describes as ``an assault on the children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The time that is lost from the classroom, you can't recover
that time,'' Ms. Arroyo said. ``With kids that are coming in with
several strikes against them to begin with, this just complicates
matters.''
</P>
<P>
   In these neighborhoods, asthma has so skewed the perception of
healthy children that several mothers said they considered it a
mark of success that their asthmatic youngsters had never been
``intubated,'' kept alive by breathing machines.
</P>
<P>
   That attitude troubles officials at the New York City Department
of Health. ``Our major concern,'' said Dr. Andrew Goodman,
associate commissioner, ``was that people were accepting a level of
symptoms as being, quote, normal.''
</P>
<P>
   So, two years ago, the department began a childhood asthma
initiative. But easing asthma, officials said, is much more than a
matter of providing good medical care. It requires the help of
educators: Teachers are now being taught about asthma. It requires
pest extermination: The housing authority, Goodman said, is
participating in a project to reduce cockroaches and interior mold.
</P>
<P>
   It requires surveillance: The health department also plans to
collect data on new kindergartners so officials can better track
patterns in asthma. And it requires negotiation: Goodman said his
agency had persuaded distributors of medical devices to sell
``spacers,'' plastic tubes used with asthma inhalers, to pharmacies
at a cost below the Medicaid reimbursement level, so that patients
will not have to pay extra.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional way to deal with a disease is to have a doctor
and a patient working together to make sure they are on the right
medicines and so forth,'' said Louise Cohen, who directs the
initiative, which costs taxpayers $6 million a year. ``That is
necessary but insufficient around asthma. There is a whole set of
social support that needs to be built.''
</P>
<P>
   Although city health officials say they are working on improving
medical care for children, critics say the city fails to provide
the primary medical care that poor children need.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you cannot at the end of the day provide the medical care
that you have educated people about, you have only completed half
the bargain and you end up with some very frustrated families,''
said Dr. Irwin Redlener, president of the Children's Hospital at
Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. ``We get patients coming to
us who have learned from the public education campaign who say to
us, `But we need a doctor.'''
</P>
<P>
   And some community leaders complain that the city is not doing
enough to address one trigger in particular, outdoor air pollution.
There is some scientific evidence that diesel exhaust can worsen
asthma by making people more sensitive to other allergens, said Dr.
Patrick Kinney, an environmental health expert at Columbia
University. Goodman said the city's position was that diesel and
other outdoor pollutants should be reduced ``to the extent
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Bronx, a group of environmental activists called We
Stay/Nos Quedamos has seized on the evidence that diesel exhaust
can exacerbate asthma and is organizing teen-agers to count the
number of trucks that rumble through the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to come up with some kind of paper trail,'' said
Jolanda Garcia, the founder of We Stay. Ms. Garcia presides over
the truck counting from a tattered storefront with yellowed lace
curtains on Courtlandt Avenue. Her 27-year-old son died two years
ago from asthma. She contends that pollution killed him.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Causes
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, scientists would have agreed with Ms. Garcia that
diesel exhaust and other pollutants might be causing the asthma
epidemic. Now, they believe the picture is more complex. To begin
with, asthma cases are surging as pollution levels are declining.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Fernando Martinez, director of the Respiratory Sciences
Center at the University of Arizona in Tucson, said scientists did
not think pollution was the sole cause of the disease, a finding
that he said came from a ``natural experiment'' conducted in
Germany after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to look at two populations, East and West Germans,
with similar genetic backgrounds but different environments, to
determine whether different living conditions could be associated
with different rates of disease. Experts assumed that asthma would
be more prevalent in the more heavily industrialized and polluted
East. But the study found just the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   The German study helped scientists to see that whatever caused
asthma was probably separate from what triggered asthma attacks.
Typically, asthma appears before age 6. ``If we are going to
understand not what triggers asthma but what causes asthma,''
Martinez said, ``we have to look at the first years of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, scientists are focusing on genetics. This month, a team
at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California reported the
discovery of two genes that contribute to the development of
asthma. Researchers are also looking at what happens to the immune
system in early life.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most talked-about new theories is that the rise in
asthma is related to improved hygiene. The idea is that babies are
less likely to be exposed to viruses and bacteria, and without that
exposure, their immune systems do not mature fully. The result is
asthma.
</P>
<P>
   That might explain why people who live on farms, or in rural
areas, are less likely to develop asthma than people in cities.
Perhaps, said Dr. Sonia Buist, an asthma expert at Oregon Health
Sciences University in Portland, it is because people on farms are
more likely to be exposed to soil organisms, and that exposure
somehow immunizes them against asthma.
</P>
<P>
   ``A century ago,'' Dr. Buist said, ``most people walked around
with a load of worms or parasites, and the immune system became
pretty good at dealing with them. As hygiene has increased and the
water system has improved, we have done away with all that priming
of the immune system.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists know that asthma often develops along a pathway;
early in life, the immune system is ``sensitized'' to allergens and
pollutants that trigger asthma attacks. If sensitization never
takes place, they reason, asthma might never occur.
</P>
<P>
   At Columbia University, researchers are trying to determine when
sensitization happens. They are enrolling 480 pregnant women who
will carry air-quality monitors for two days in the third
trimester. Their babies' umbilical-cord blood will be analyzed, and
the infants will be followed for five years to see who develops
asthma.
</P>
<P>
   It is an ambitious study, the first of its kind, said Dr.
Frederica Perera, who directs the university's Center for
Children's Environmental Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are interested in prevention,'' Perera said, ``and
prevention means going younger and younger until you can stop the
process, and not waiting until children are using inhalers at the
age of 5 or 6. But there was very little information on early life
exposures, even those occurring in the womb.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Challenges
</P>
<P>
   Until scientists learn more about prevention, doctors and nurses
are left to teach patients how to manage the disease, through
proper medication and changes in their environment. But that is
proving more difficult than anyone anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, federal health officials recommended the daily
use of inhaled corticosteroids to control asthma in people with
moderate or severe disease. Experts say the medicines can reduce
emergency-room visits, hospitalizations and deaths. But only half
the eligible patients use them, said Dr. William Busse, a professor
of medicine at the University of Wisconsin in Madison who helped
write the recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a major reason why we see kids here,'' Dr. Bruce Klein,
associate medical director of the emergency department at
Children's National Medical Center in Washington, said on the day
that John, Kyle and Burnell were treated. ``It strikes me as an
immense failure of the health-care system that an awful lot of the
asthmatics that we take care of are not being treated according to
those guidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason, Busse said, is that the idea of asthma as a serious
chronic disorder that requires daily medical management is
relatively new, and many doctors have not yet accepted it. Another
is that pediatricians do not like to prescribe, and parents do not
like to give, daily medicine to children, especially steroids,
which can stunt growth and cause other problems in high doses. And
a third is poor health care and inadequate insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Ollie Cunningham is a case in point. At 45, she is the mother of
nine children, ages 4 through 22. Seven have asthma. The family,
which lives in an immaculate two-story, three-bedroom house in the
southwest corner of Washington, has no health insurance. Mrs.
Cunningham's husband, Anthony, is a maintenance man and earns too
much to qualify for Medicaid, the government health plan for the
poor.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Mrs. Cunningham said, she made so many frantic
trips to the emergency room at D.C. General Hospital, the city's
public hospital, that the doctors there knew her by name. Each trip
brought the terror of cradling a child who could not breathe. And
each brought a new worry: the bills.
</P>
<P>
   The family ran up such a tab, nearly $10,000, that D.C. General
began garnishing Anthony Cunningham's wages, his wife said.
Sometimes she borrowed money for the children's medicine. If two
children were given the same prescription, she would fill one and
have them share.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say this kind of crisis management is the worst form of
asthma care. It is expensive, and patients do not get the benefits
of steady monitoring from a doctor who knows them.
</P>
<P>
   The Cunninghams eventually received regular medical care,
although it was short-lived. In 1996, having worn out her welcome
at D.C. General, Mrs. Cunningham tried another emergency room, the
one at Howard University Hospital. There she was introduced to
Ellie Thornton, an asthma counselor.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Thornton was hired as an outgrowth of the Inner City Asthma
Study, a government-sponsored research project in which Howard
University participated.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dr. Floyd Malveaux, an asthma expert at Howard, the
study found that by working closely with families, counselors could
dramatically reduce children's asthma symptoms. If the parents
smoked, for instance, the counselor could persuade them to enroll
in a course to stop. If cockroach infestation was a problem, she
might arrange for pest control.
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Thornton met the Cunninghams, she enrolled them in a
free asthma clinic that Howard was running at the time. For the
first time, the children had regular medical care. And their mother
got an earful of asthma education.
</P>
<P>
   The family's house had wall-to-wall carpeting, which attracts
dust mites; Anthony Cunningham ripped it out. Mrs. Cunningham
stopped using air freshener; she had no idea it was a trigger. The
Cunninghams got rid of their cat. They learned to keep the windows
shut when the pollen count was high, and borrowed money to install
air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   The toughest battle, Mrs. Cunningham said, was over her
husband's smoking. ``I told him, `You can't smoke around the
kids,''' she said. ``That was a shock. He smokes outside now.''
</P>
<P>
   But the help the Cunninghams received is not always available.
``I would love to have a nurse, or someone who could sit down with
families and spend more time with them exploring what makes their
child's asthma difficult to control and how they could improve
it,'' said Dr. Robert Fink at Children's National Medical Center.
But, Fink said, ``I don't have the money.''
</P>
<P>
   At Howard, the free clinic was open for only a year, although
the hospital recently obtained grant money and intends to reopen it
within the month. Mrs. Thornton, however, is still on board. She
counsels families from a two-room office furnished with a couple of
desks and chairs and an old baby swing. Her goal, she said, is to
shut the ``revolving emergency-room door.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Cunninghams, at least, she seems to have succeeded.
Although the family still has no insurance, and no regular medical
care, emergency-room visits are much less frequent now, and the
children's school attendance has improved. Mrs. Cunningham said she
feels more comfortable leaving home now. Recently she took a job to
help pay medical bills. Last year the children saw a dentist for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's made it better for every member of the family,'' Mrs.
Cunningham said, ``even the ones who don't have asthma.''

THREAT OF UNREST LOOMS OVER INDONESIAN ELECTION
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ The banners read ``Megawati or revolution''
and there are many people here who believe that they are not only a
threat but a prediction.
</P>
<P>
   Megawati Sukarnoputri, the standard-bearer of Indonesia's
political opposition, won the most votes in a parliamentary
election last June. But she could be elbowed aside in a hard-knocks
battle for the presidency that will be decided on Wednesday by a
ballot in the national assembly.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens and the voters are deprived of the outcome of
Indonesia's first free election in a generation, Sarwono
Kusumaatmadja, a former Cabinet minister, predicted that ``the
country will be thrown into total chaos _ total civil chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   The incumbent interim president, B.J. Habibie, is fighting hard
to keep his job, moving an unsympathetic assembly to a standing
ovation Sunday as he defended his record and threw himself on their
mercy.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all humility, I appeal for forgiveness for all my
shortcomings and for my inability to reach perfection,'' he said in
an emotional overture to a once subservient assembly that now has
the power to make and break kings. ``I am not some extraordinary
being who came down from the heavens to turn hopes into
realities.''
</P>
<P>
   Habibie is doing far more than pleading. His supporters have
been twisting arms and making deals within the 700-seat assembly,
working to gain allies and narrow the margin with Megawati's party,
from 153 seats to 120, that resulted from the June election.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Megawati has infuriated many political analysts
with her passivity, remaining aloof from the political battle and
making few public statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hanging on a very fine balance,'' Sarwono, the former
Cabinet minister, said of the presidential competition, which also
includes a third candidate, Abdurrahman Wahid, a prominent Muslim
leader. ``Outside pressure is now crucial to the outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   The pro-Megawati pressure is coming from all sides: from
students, from the poor, who see Megawati as their savior, and from
much of the country's elite, including executives at the stock
exchange, who staged their own rally last week.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of civil unrest is one of Megawati's strongest cards
in a nation where violence simmers constantly. And although she has
in the past refused to call her supporters into the streets for
fear of bloodshed, they are there now in large numbers, warning of
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Save Indonesia from chaos: Habibie has lost the right to be
president,'' read a banner at a rally Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It was the students, with their obstinate rallies, who forced
the crisis that brought down Habibie's predecessor, Suharto, in May
1998. And their continuing street rallies have helped keep a
reformist agenda alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pressure group par excellence,'' one foreign diplomat called
them. ``They are an important part of the political equation.''
</P>
<P>
   Now a new element has joined them in daily rallies that have
focused on the Parliament building, where the national assembly is
meeting to choose the president: thousands of poor people, who form
the base of Megawati's constituency.
</P>
<P>
   They are controlled by a strange private militia of supporters
of Megawati, wearing red berets and black paramilitary uniforms
resplendent with red insignia, patches, piping, buttons and braid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are ready to die if she is not elected president,'' said
one militia member, Goenawan, a 45-year-old rice farmer who had
traveled from Surabaya at the far eastern tip of the island of
Java. ``We won't make it back to our villages; only our names
will.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressing one palm down on the other in illustration, his friend,
Entan Djayarasa, 50, said, ``Megawati stands for us little people
who are always being stepped on.''
</P>
<P>
   A group of demonstrators wearing the white headbands of a
multiparty group of supporters of Megawati were also proud to
describe themselves as ``little people.''
</P>
<P>
   They hurried to interrupt each other as they described the
attributes that drew them to Megawati, who is the daughter of
Indonesia's founding president, Sukarno.
</P>
<P>
   ``She never comments on anything,'' said Muhamad Amirudin, 30,
who has a low-paid job with a small manufacturer. ``She doesn't
talk a lot like the other politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Zakaria, 21, who is one of Indonesia's millions of unemployed
young men, agreed. ``She's very quiet,'' he said. ``She's not too
ambitious.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridu Ibrahim, 31, a slaughterhouse worker, explained, ``We don't
want a leader with too much theory.''
</P>
<P>
   Suwarno, a 55-year-old farmer from eastern Java, drew applause
from the little group when he said, ``I've come here to represent
the small people, like farmers, so our voices are not forgotten.
Megawati stands for us small people, so we owe her our support.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was a little doubtful about the notion of a revolution if
she fails to become president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea what will happen if she loses,'' Suwarno said.
``As for me, the rainy season is coming and I have to go home and
plant corn.''

JOURNAL EDITOR WEIGHS CNN OFFER  
 LEGENDARY CURMUDGEON  
 PLATINUM PORTAL FOR THE RICH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Paul Steiger, the managing editor of The Wall Street
Journal, is considering an offer from CNN to take the helm of the
network's financial news outlets _ including the troubled CNNfn
financial network _ which have been without their own leader since
the departure of Lou Dobbs in June.
</P>
<P>
   Steiger's talks with the network, a unit of Time Warner Inc.,
have been going on in stutter-step fashion for weeks, according to
people who have spoken with both parties in the negotiations.
Steiger, The Journal's top newsroom executive, has discussed the
scope and authority of the new job with CNN's president, Ted
Turner. He has discussed his options with Peter Kann, the chief
executive of Dow Jones &AMP; Co., The Journal's parent.
</P>
<P>
   If he decided to make the switch, Steiger, who is 57, would be
leaving the command of about 600 journalists at the nation's
premier financial newspaper, whom he has led for the last seven
years, to assume control of a staff of 300 at both CNN and CNNfn.
</P>
<P>
   The financial network reaches fewer than one-fifth of the 68
million homes reached by its chief rival, CNBC. And since Dobbs
left to start his own World Wide Web site, the lines of authority
over CNN's financial coverage have been unclear.
</P>
<P>
   But if Steiger made the move, he would follow a
newspaper-to-cable-TV path blazed by Tom Johnson, CNN's chief
executive, who was the publisher of The Los Angeles Times in the
early 1980s _ a period when Steiger was that newspaper's business
editor. The job of heading both CNNfn and the financial news
segments of the main cable channel and its Web site ``is truly an
international job, when there are few international jobs left,''
said one person who has talked to both sides in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring in Steiger's calculations may be the fact that it has
been rare for any managing editor of The Journal to move to the top
of the corporate ladder at Dow Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Steiger referred telephone calls about his discussions to
Richard Tofel, the Dow Jones spokesman, who, when asked for a
comment, would say only ``Pass.'' Sue Binford, a spokeswoman for
CNN, also declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   But the assumption that Steiger was about to leave permeated The
Journal's newsroom Friday. Among the names mentioned as possible
successors are Daniel Hertzberg, who is one of two deputy managing
editors, and, from elsewhere inside Dow Jones, Steven Swartz,
editor in chief of Smart Money, and Paul Ingrassia, the president
of Dow Jones Newswires.

   _ FELICITY BARRINGER
</P>
<P>
   Mythic City Editor Is Brought Back to Life
</P>
<P>
   In a year fixated on the millennium, a 65th anniversary does not
amount to much. But as an artifact of its time, the reissue of
Stanley Walker's classic 1934 book, ``City Editor'' (Johns Hopkins
University Press), has its moments as a saucy explication of the
Depression-era newspaper world. It's a baseline for how far we've
come and how far we haven't.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Walker was city editor of The New York Herald Tribune.
Before television and the flight of readership to the suburbs, city
editors were mythic figures around town, unforgiving tribal leaders
known for a thick brand of curmudgeonliness. Or, as Walker wrote,
the city editor was ``a chilly, monstrous figure, sleepless,
nerveless and facing with ribald mockery the certain hell which
awaits him.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker, by reputation, was a cut above the average misanthrope.
In his forward to the book, Alexander Woollcott described him as
``the most notable city editor of his time,'' endlessly fascinated
by ``the changeless and ever-changing Baghdad which is the
territory of his staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Walker's observations seem quaint. Decades before Evian,
liquor was an issue in newsrooms, though even then its use was
beginning to wane. But, in Walker's day, there was also a familiar
sense of foreboding. Chains were buying up independent newspapers,
and many worried that, with the growth of the wire services, the
entire industry was becoming homogenized.
</P>
<P>
   There was also worry about the great experiment _ the tabloid.
The Daily News, after its birth in 1919, had confounded all
skeptics and become a raging success. Where would this all lead?
</P>
<P>
   The public relations industry was spinning out of control.
Walker wrote: ``New York, where even the simplest projects must be
carried out with as much indirection, hocus-pocus and skulduggery
as human ingenuity can devise, is the natural home of the press
agent. The city undoubtedly has more press agents, if the disguises
of all of them could be penetrated, than it has working
newspapermen.''
</P>
<P>
   This was at least three decades before political correctness.
But Walker was not above linking journalistic traits to ethnic
traits. He called Irishmen, by and large, the best newspapermen
around. About Jews, he said: ``Jewish reporters are impossible to
classify; some are cloddish, some brilliant, some level-headed,
some itching with messianic afflictions, some profligate, and some
closefisted and scheming. One thing surely may be said about them:
most Jews know enough not to drink too much.''
</P>
<P>
   He also grappled with that great new giant of media _ radio. Was
it a threat, or a boon? Were radio reporters just pretty voices or
were they up to the job?
</P>
<P>
   His take:
</P>
<P>
   ``Radio eventually will drive many newspapers out of business.
Radio news will become more reliable. Newspapers, certainly the
stronger ones which survive the struggle, will become better. Some
day (it is scientifically possible now) some sort of television
device will bring a complete newspaper to the customer over the
wire. Whatever happens, the public can't lose. And the reporter
can't lose. That gentleman, whether on the air or at his
typewriter, will always have his work to do.''

   Worth Strives to Be Internet-Oriented
</P>
<P>
   Pssst...Hey, you _ rich guy. Need a house in the Hamptons? A
Gulfstream jet? Want to buy one online?
</P>
<P>
   W. Randall Jones thinks that wealthy Americans are willing to
shop online for everything from charter flights to duplex
apartments _ and he's shifting the focus of his magazine company to
do just that, joining the wave of publishers turning their
attention to the Internet. Jones said last week that Capital
Publishing, the company of which he is chief executive, will now be
known as the more Internet-oriented Worth Media.
</P>
<P>
   Early in 1998, Jones had said he wanted to expand his print fief
_ which then consisted of Worth, Civilization, Equity and The
American Benefactor. But late last year, Jones folded The American
Benefactor and this year he said that the quarterly Equity would be
published twice a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at how we could expand this company,'' Jones said.
``If you're running a magazine and it's cooking on all burners, you
could get a valuation of twice the revenues. When you're doing that
with a working Internet strategy, you can get 200 times revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   With a $5 million investment from Dawntreader, an Internet
venture fund, Jones will build what he calls ``a platinum portal
for the rich'' _ Worth.com, which he will introduce next spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think of a day or a week in the life of a wealthy
person, we want to be the portal they go to to meet all their
needs,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   One impact of the reorganization: Joe Armstrong, Capital's group
publisher and a former publisher of New York and Rolling Stone, has
resigned. ``I am still in love with print,'' Armstrong said, ``and
I really want to be in a company where print is big and important,
the principal focus. Call me a fish swimming against the tide.''

   BAZARAK, Afghanistan _ Those who only had their houses burned or
crops destroyed often apologize because their story is not bad
enough. They are sheepish about complaining.
</P>
<P>
   And so they lead the way to the worse off, the irretrievably
broken or the unbearably sorrowful _ the children with parents who
were murdered as they watched or the men whose wives were carried
off screaming or the old woman whose story no one is sure of, but
she has been sobbing for two months now, fingering a red flower
embroidered on a pink cloth.
</P>
<P>
   Afghanistan's ruling Taliban militia, along with thousands of
Pakistanis lit with the fervor of jihad, went on a destructive
spree this summer, killing wantonly, emptying entire towns,
machine-gunning livestock, sawing down fruit trees, blasting apart
irrigation canals. It was a binge of blood lust and mayhem
described with consistent detail by witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Among the survivors are an estimated 65,000 refugees who have
escaped to the Panjsher Valley, a nape of land nestled within the
rugged Himalayan peaks of the Hindu Kush. Huddled in makeshift
tents fashioned from cloth and plastic, relentlessly foraging for
firewood, they are free for now from their tormentors but not yet
safe from the famously deep snows and furious winds of the winter
soon to come.
</P>
<P>
   On July 28, the Taliban began a long-anticipated summer
offensive. The militia, which has been on a largely unstoppable
march since 1995, wanted to take command of the 10 percent to 20
percent of the country not yet under its control.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   This time, they attacked in three places, sending their main
juggernaut into the Shamali Valley just north of Kabul. More than
6,000 soldiers rolled through towns and villages in what survivors
describe as a well-coordinated assault supported by tanks,
artillery and aerial bombardments.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The onslaught was overpowering, but after a week, as the Taliban
celebrated victory, they were stunned by a night-time
counterattack. The opposition forces of Ahmad Shah Massoud, their
lone remaining nemesis, hit back, springing ambushes and slaying
hundreds _ perhaps more than 1,000 _ of the Taliban forces, who
reportedly suffered even more losses in a disorderly retreat.
</P>
<P>
   It was a military triumph, but much of the land recovered was
already ruins and scorched earth.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``Why did they have to kill my cows and goats, and why cut down
the mulberry trees and stomp through my garden?'' asked Mohammad
Kasim, 59, a refugee who now lives here in the town of Bazarak, his
home a tent of thin and porous blankets held up by branches.
</P>
<P>
   Kasim is a man with a long angular face topped by a turban and
completed with a thick under-hang of beard. He had the anxious,
bewildered look of someone terrified of the future. ``We have
nothing now except for God,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nafas Jon, 45, a gaunt, tired woman with six children, has taken
sanctuary along with 1,000 others in Bazarak's small, decrepit
school. ``The Taliban took my husband out of the house and cut him
down,'' she said evenly. ``They were killing everyone who looked
young, thinking they must be soldiers. I screamed then and I cry
now. We have nothing left.''
</P>
<P>
   She sat in a space made private by cloths hung from rope, a
hovel barely three-feet high. ``We returned once to see our
house,'' Mrs. Jon said, pausing a few seconds to frame the memory
in her mind. ``The ceiling is now on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Guldara, Saraykhoja, Bagram, Karabagh: from these and other
towns to the north of Kabul, dozens of refugees _ interviewed
independently _ had much the same story to tell, of people shot in
their homes, fires everywhere, beatings, abductions, mass flight.
</P>
<P>
   To them, the Taliban's purpose was obvious. Afghanistan, for
thousands of years one of the great crossroads of Asia, has endured
invasions and migrations that have left it a demanding
anthropological puzzle of ethnicities and tribes. The Taliban are
largely ethnic Pathans and they wanted to not only rid the area of
ethnic Tajiks, whose resistance to them has been steadfast, but to
leave their enemies with nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The militia's leaders have explained their summer rampage
differently, calling it a humanitarian act. They insist that
Massoud's forces _ the so-called United Front _ have used these
towns as redoubts for launching attacks. The populace lived in
constant danger.
</P>
<P>
   To ``save'' the citizenry, the Taliban forced most of them to
flee; others were trucked to Kabul, the nation's capital, or the
city of Jalalabad. Some 12,500 displaced people _ more than 8,000
of them children _ are living in the compound of the closed Soviet
embassy in Kabul, according to a U.N. report. More than 2,000 Tajik
men are locked within the cramped stone caverns of Kabul's
Pul-i-Charki Prison, said a spokesman for Massoud.
</P>
<P>
   There are an estimated 130,000 refugees in all, the largest
concentration of them here in the Panjsher Valley. For two and a
half months now, they have been pondering the devastation to their
earthly possessions and growing fixated on the icy challenge to
their survival that lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   International aid groups have been late to mobilize, apparently
unsure of whether the refugees could go back home _ or if those
homes still stood. The agencies are now swiftly setting up shop,
dividing the tasks: shelter, fuel, bread, blankets, medicine.
</P>
<P>
   This has not been a high-profile crisis because this is no
longer a high-profile place. In the 1980s, the West lavished
attention _ and weapons _ on Afghan warriors charging down from the
mountains to match the might of the invading Soviet army. These
days, few people are watching.
</P>
<P>
   Afghanistan is remote, distanced further by 21 years of war that
have reversed the course of modernization. Indeed, much of the
necessary aid must be carried over a single overland route from
Tajikistan. It requires a journey of up to 10 days on a narrow,
unpaved road pocked with ruts huge enough to swallow a car.
Momentous effort will be needed merely to keep the high-altitude
mountain passes from becoming snowbound.
</P>
<P>
   ``If both sides would agree not to shoot at aircraft, we could
have an airlift,'' said Fayyez Shah, who heads the U. N. team in
Bazarak. ``Or a humanitarian corridor could be opened on some other
roads.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Afghan government _ the one driven out of Kabul in 1996 and
still recognized by most of the world _ continues to operate, if
feebly, here in the nation's far northeast. Kamaluddin Nasami, its
planning director for the refugee crisis, said he is grateful for
the help of the aid agencies but is frustrated by their delays.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tell me the road is unsafe, but tell me where and we will
make it safe,'' he said. ``The fighting is not on the road; it is
to the sides of the road.''
</P>
<P>
   The refugees also complain. They are receiving wheat for bread,
and some have the use of bright blue plastic tarps courtesy of the
U.N. But the nights are cold, the children undernourished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each organization comes and makes a list and then nothing
happens,'' said Gulam Said, who lives amid a collection of 100
tents along the turbulent current of the Panjsher River. ``What
shall we do? Every week, we have two children die.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The air here teems with tragedy. The accounts of the refugees
rival those of Kosovo, the horror only lessened by its numbing
repetition.
</P>
<P>
   With fighting still going on, and the deserted towns still along
the front lines, the extent of the death and destruction is
impossible to measure. Individual stories cannot be confirmed by
first-hand observation. They are supported only by the uniformity
of their particulars.
</P>
<P>
   People are eager to tell these stories, their personal losses
now a vital part of their identity.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the many clusters of tents, Mohammad Wali, a
round-faced 10-year-old boy, poked his head through a crowd and
called out, ``They shot my father and I saw it.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He said there had been a hard knocking on their door. His father
nervously walked toward the gate. The men outside fired
Kalashnikovs. With his father dead, he ran back inside as fast as
he could. His mother, he said, ``needed to know about it right
away.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Shakar Gul, her arms around her nephew's waist, said the boy,
Gules Tan, is 3. ``His father was killed, and his mother was taken
away,'' the aunt said.
</P>
<P>
   She sat on a rock and occasionally lifted the cloth that covered
her head, the traditional chadar, to conceal her face. ``He cries
out, `Where is my mother?' '' she said. ``We tell him she has gone
away but will come back soon. In time, God willing, he will forget
her.''

<P>
   Lida, 15, like many Afghans, uses only one name. She was wearing
a purple dress with paisley decorations, and while her eyes were
moist, she refused to let tears escape to her smooth cheeks. Her
younger sisters had designated her to speak for the family.
</P>
<P>
   She said, ``At first, they took my brother Sardar and my father
pleaded, `Do not kill my only son,' and then after they shot
Sardar, my father cried so much they shot him, too.''
</P>
<P>
   People wandered out of the ragged, homemade tents to serve up
their grief. A man scavenged through his pockets to find the tiny
snapshot of his murdered son. A weeping woman, Najila, 20, said her
parents were killed by a bomb as they drank tea. ``They had been
discussing how we were going to run away,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Akbar Shah, 50, said his sister died as their family fled toward
the valley, part of a flood of terrified people walking and
stumbling on the cramped road: ``She was OK, she was coming with
me. Then someone yelled, `Run, the Taliban are coming!' and
suddenly she just sat on the dirt, her heart stopped and she fell
over.''
</P>
<P>
   The Panjsher Valley was a two-day journey on foot from their
ruined homes. As refugees rushed across the crowded bridge near Gul
Bahar at night, they could not help but jostle each other. Many
fell off, grasping at the empty air, going down through the
darkness onto the rocks and water below.
</P>
<P>
   Zaker, a 12-year-old boy in a torn brown sweater, said he, too,
lost his father to the Taliban's busy Kalashnikovs. Then his mother
tumbled off the Gul Bahar bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I listened for her voice for a long time, and then went on,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Tajiks speak a dialect of Persian called Dari. Their
attackers, they said, spoke not only Pushtun, the tongue of the
Pathans, but Urdu and Punjabi, languages more commonly spoken in
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Mullah Mohammad Omar, the Taliban's supreme leader, had called
upon Muslims in madrasahs, or religious schools, to join the jihad.
Thousands of students in neighboring Pakistan share the Taliban's
puritanical interpretation of Islam. They were openly bussed across
major border crossings and given weapons training.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the refugees, Sardar Agha, 28, a man in a
wheelchair, insisted that some of his attackers were foreigners.
``I know Afghans,'' he said. ``They were not Afghans.''
</P>
<P>
   Some made other distinctions. Taliban army regulars enforced
cultural taboos, smashing TV sets and ripping apart music tapes.
Newer recruits, whether Afghans or Pakistanis, were more likely to
be thieves, a few refugees said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd bust into your house, hold a gun to the head of your
children and demand either money or guns,'' said a woman from
Kapisa province, a former literature professor. She asked for
anonymity because she had relatives still in Kabul. ``If you
complained to the Talibs, they'd tell you that they didn't control
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the refugees here may be poorer than they were, but not
all are poor. A few escaped by car, their most valued possessions
tethered to the roof with rope.
</P>
<P>
   Some families from Bagram, confessing prosperity, had several
hand-made oriental carpets stacked against their tent walls, and
others to make soft floors atop the stony soil.
</P>
<P>
   But there are not many comforts to purchase in the Panjsher
Valley. In Bazarak, there is no telephone service. Electrical power
comes only from private generators, and the fuel to run them is
exorbitantly priced. The river is both a wash basin and a toilet.
</P>
<P>
   Basic shelter for the refugee multitude has been left to ACTED,
a French charity. The agency has a plan: Public buildings will be
insulated. Damaged houses will be repaired. Twenty-five hundred
``survival cells'' will be built _ simple dwellings with walls of
stone and mortar, windows of plastic sheeting and roofs of bamboo.
Building is just getting started. The planners hope it will be
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Priority will be given to the hundreds of families now living in
mosques, which need to be vacated. With the weather getting cold,
men no longer want to say their prayers on the rooftops of their
holy places.
</P>
<P>
   Bazarak's mosque is a modest yellow building, a single open
space with a green carpet. Fifty-one families are living there.
Outside, women feed wood chips into cooking fires, their heads bent
to the ground, their breath used to stoke the embers.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby is the town's school. Many of its desks have become the
undersized walls for cave-like spaces. Hanging blankets often
separate one family from the next. The largest room has the
appearance of a multi-colored maze.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the small spaces, near an open doorway, a woman named
Anita, 35, spoke of the death of the youngest of her eight
children. The girl's name was Farastha, age 1. The child began to
cry and quiver when the Taliban bombardment began and never seemed
to stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``She died of fear,'' the mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Twilight had come, and the school was growing dark. Anita pulled
close one of her small children and buttoned his sweater. The wind
had stirred, sweeping down as it does from the mountains at night,
another reminder of the winter day by day creeping near.

A LOOK TOWARD THE COLLEGE FOOTBALL FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two of the most memorable predictions in my lifetime have been
intoned by Jon Landau and Beano Cook. Back in the 1970s, Landau was
a rock critic who listened, watched, and was moved enough by a New
Jersey singer-songwriter to declare him the ``rock'n'roll future.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, Beano Cook was a television sports pundit who
watched, listened and was moved enough by a Notre Dame quarterback
to say that the kid would win an unprecedented three Heisman
Trophies.
</P>
<P>
   Landau was right about Bruce Springsteen and went on to manage
and produce some of the Boss' albums as well as to become a wealthy
and influential music impresario on his own.
</P>
<P>
   Cook was dead wrong about Ron Powlus, who never came close to
winning one Heisman, but Beano remains an entertaining presence on
cable television.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the penthouse and outhouse addresses of prognosticators
in mind, there's a couple of educated (mostly) predictions to make
now that the1999 college football season is beyond the halfway
point.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term: First, Tommy Bowden and the Clemson Tigers
won't roll over for Bobby Bowden when Daddy and Florida State goes
to South Carolina this week to win his milestone 300th game and
keep the Seminoles' on track for the national title.
</P>
<P>
   Second, like Kansas State last year, Virginia Tech will now be
discovered by the national media, ridiculed for its soft schedule
and roil the Bowl Championship Series rankings down to the final
week of the season.
</P>
<P>
   In the medium range: The Big Ten title race is brutal, muddled
and will change each Saturday as upstarts surge and front-runners
stumble.
</P>
<P>
   Finally looking long. As long as Notre Dame remains the most
galvanizing college football program in America, and Steve Spurrier
remains the game's most galvanizing coach, Spurrier-to-Notre Dame
will remain a constant and most sizzling rumor in all of sports.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the prospect of Bowden meeting Bowden to become only
the fifth Division I-A coach to reach 300 victories isn't as warm
and fuzzy as it looked before the season. The Seminoles (7-0, No. 4
in The New York Times computer rankings) are getting more attention
for the legal saga of wide receiver Peter Warrick than they are for
their recent play.
</P>
<P>
   With the one-time Heisman front runner sidelined by suspension
for a second week while awaiting to somehow depose of a felony
grand theft charge, Florida State struggled to a 9-3 halftime lead
over lightly regarded Wake Forest Saturday before putting a 33-10
victory in the books.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play great, but we came away with a win,'' said
Chris Weinke, who completed passes to 10 receivers for a
career-high 354 yards. ``We will have to be sharper for 60 minutes
the rest of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   His team's poor performance rattled the elder Bowden who knows
he must get by a budding genius in Tommy if he intends to join Joe
Paterno, Amos Alonzo Stagg, Bear Bryant and Pop Warner in the
stratosphere of the college game's honor roll next week. ``We
weren't sharp tonight. We'd better be sharp next week or we'll get
our butts whipped.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Bowden, meanwhile, has taken the remnants of a team
that was 3-8 last year and transformed them into a respectable 3-3
_ including a victory over Virginia and a three point loss to
Marshall (No. 12 in the NYT computer rankings) by turning the
offense into an aerial circus. Last year, he showed he could do
more with less by leading Tulane to a 12-0 record and might just
delay his father's 300-win game ball from arriving at the College
Football Hall of Fame for another week.
</P>
<P>
   But immediately brace to hear a lot about the Hokies of Virginia
Tech. They are 6-0, No. 2 in the NYT computer rankings and totally
annihilated Syracuse Saturday, 62-0, hanging the Orangemen with the
largest shutout loss by a ranked team in the history of the
Associated Press media poll. ``Some people may still be a little
bit doubtful, but Syracuse was the (AP) 16th-ranked team in the
nation. To beat a ranked team like this, it should say a lot,''
said Hokies receiver Andre Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Frank Beamer has built a fine program on defense and
special teams that has played on New Year's day bowls in five of
the last six years. Virginia Tech fans will hear a lot about a soft
schedule that already has featured James Madison, University of
Alabama-Birmingham and winless Rutgers, and only Miami remains with
legitimate upset potential. When the BCS releases its rankings
after this week's games, it will be interesting to see how the
eight computer rankings treat the Hokies' strength of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The prediction is that at the end of the season Virginia Tech
needs to be one of two undefeated teams in the BCS if they want to
play in the national title game. If Florida State, Nebraska and
Penn State go unbeaten _ or two of the three do _ Virginia Tech is
out of the Sugar Bowl because of their schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Ten race? Michigan survives the nation's toughest early
season ticket only to lose to undefeated Michigan State last week,
which loses Saturday to a Purdue team that lost the previous two
weeks at Michigan and Ohio State. What it means is that the Big Ten
is the nation's toughest conference and Penn State (7-0, No. 5 in
the NYT computer rankings) is going to have a very difficult time
winning out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have put 40 on the board. We had two field goals
blocked, we stopped ourselves inside their 25 all day. Stupid head
problems. We have to cut them out or it will catch up to us,''
conceded fullback Mike Cerimele, the Penn State fullback, after a
23-10 victory over Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   The prediction? It does catch up _ and either Purdue, Michigan
or Michigan State take down the conference's only undefeated team.
</P>
<P>
   Last but hardly least, the annual Spurrier to Notre Dame rumor
is in the air. It starts in the Southeastern Conference where fans
can't stand the flamboyant coach who regularly beats them. It is
embraced by the vast Notre Dame community which is tiring of Bob
Davie's reign.
</P>
<P>
   The prediction: When (If?) Spurrier takes over in South Bend,
the Fighting Irish win six titles in the coach's first 10 years and
the Notre Dame television contract increases to Olympic
proportions.
</P>
<P>
   That's one for you, Beano.

FIGHTING OFF CAMPAIGN REFORM, WITH FIRST AMENDMENT'S SHIELD

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It has become one of the enduring rituals on
Capitol Hill:
</P>
<P>
   A bill to overhaul the nation's campaign finance laws is being
debated on the floor of the Senate. Its advocates and their many
allies on the editorial pages are in full cry, demanding change for
the sake of a cleaner, better, more democratic politics. And the
senior senator from Kentucky, Mitch McConnell, is doing his best to
block the bill.
</P>
<P>
   So it went last week: Cheerfully, with conviction, with no
apologies, McConnell stood in the well of the Senate, hour after
hour, swatting back arguments that the system is corrupt, that it
breeds cynicism, that it shuts out the little guy for the monied
special interests. ``I have sort of been the designated spear
catcher on this issue,'' McConnell said, somewhat proudly, during a
recent break in the debate, which is now focused on a proposed ban
on ``soft money,'' the unlimited contributions that go to the
political parties.
</P>
<P>
   Does he read what they say about him, all those editorial
writers who cast him as the dark knight, the enemy of reform?
</P>
<P>
   ``I read them,'' he said. ``I find them exhilarating. The more
they beat me up, the more I'm determined to try to prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   McConnell, 57, a Republican first elected to the Senate in 1984,
has been in this struggle for a very long time _ ``the point man on
this issue for our side since the late 1980s,'' as he puts it, and
intellectually engaged for longer than that. Not surprisingly, he
presents himself as the defender of the First Amendment, not of
corrupt, big money politics. It is not really about money, he
suggests, but about free speech.
</P>
<P>
   He delights in upending the conventional wisdom. ``Everyone who
runs against me thinks, `This is the way I'm going to beat this
guy,' '' he said, a small smile playing around his otherwise stern
face. (He was re-elected with 55 percent of the vote in 1996.)
McConnell says his message to the voters is simple: ``I don't think
the government ought to be in charge of how many of you can
contribute to my campaign, or how often I may speak, or what I may
say. This is all about whether the government can determine who
gets to speak, how much they get to speak, and when they get to
speak in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   He is scornful of past efforts at regulating campaign
contributions, arguing that the much-vaunted $1,000 limit on
individual contributions ended up benefiting ``the well-off _ Steve
Forbes _ or the well-known _ George W. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing wrong with the current system is the last
reform,'' McConnell said. ``And the last thing we need to do is
take that kind of nonsense any further.''
</P>
<P>
   Such arguments drive his opponents around the bend. ``I find the
disingenuousness of his comments breathtaking,'' said Charles
Lewis, executive director of the Center for Public Integrity.
``Every narrow, grubby thing that comes before Congress involving
money and power is usually cloaked with something noble and
majestic. He has found the First Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Many critics note that McConnell has a more than constitutional
interest in how the campaign finance laws work: An avid fund-raiser
and hard-ball political strategist, he is chairman of the National
Republican Senatorial Committee, and thus charged with protecting
and enlarging his party's majority in the 2000 elections. He argued
on NBC's ``Meet The Press'' on Sunday that Republicans needed
``soft money'' to level the playing field because so much of the
political discussion in the press, academia and Hollywood was
dominated by the left.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell flinches a little at the term ``career politician,''
noting that it has acquired a pejorative cast, but he has spent his
life in electoral politics. The son of a employee relations manager
for DuPont, McConnell was born in Alabama and raised in south
Louisville. His childhood was marked by polio, which he contracted
at age 2, and which kept him off his feet until he was 5. His
interest in politics came early; he was elected student body
president in high school and again at the University of Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   A portrait of one of his inspirations hangs in his Senate
office: a great uncle who was the elected Democratic probate judge
of Limestone County, Ala. But his biggest inspiration, he said, was
the late Sen. John Sherman Cooper of Kentucky; McConnell was an
intern in his office in 1964, when Cooper was supporting the
landmark Civil Rights Act in the face of vocal opposition back
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I liked about Sen. Cooper was his willingness to go
against the flow,'' McConnell said. ``It was not ever envisioned
that we would come up here and be a kind of rolling poll, or sort
of like that plant over there, that potted plant, and just sort of
accept input and do whatever the popular mood was at the moment.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   McConnell takes prickly offense at the prevailing wisdom that
the Senate is not the institution it used to be. The current
legislative struggle pits him against a fellow Republican, Sen.
John McCain of Arizona, who is seeking his party's presidential
nomination and has made cleaning up the campaign finance system a
central part of his platform. McConnell and his allies verbally
pummeled McCain this week for raising the notion that Congress has
been corrupted by special interest political money.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell said afterward, ``There's never been an exchange I've
been involved in on the Senate floor that's gotten me more pats on
the back from my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. For a
colleague who's running for president to make a cornerstone of his
campaign that this institution is corrupt, and then be called upon
to prove it and have no evidence whatsoever, is pretty galling to
those of us who work here every day.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who spent more than five years in a prisoner of war camp
during Vietnam, countered later, ``I've faced a lot tougher things
in my life than Mitch McConnell's temper tantrums.''
</P>
<P>
   McConnell, who has three grown daughters by a first marriage, is
now married to Elaine Chao, a distinguished fellow at the Heritage
Foundation and a former director of the Peace Corps in the Bush
administration. Asked how he spends his leisure time, McConnell
says, ``I have a great wife. We enjoy each other's company.''
</P>
<P>
   He also fishes and reads. But politics is clearly his passion,
and the political fray his favorite place to be. ``I'm proud of my
enemies,'' he said. ``If I had to be disliked by an organization, I
can't think of a better one to be disliked by than Common Cause.''

ASTHMA BECOMES AN EPIDEMIC AMONG CITY CHILDREN

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The asthma epidemic visited Children's National Medical Center
one recent Friday, the day after a furious rainstorm kicked up
allergens all over Washington. By 9 a.m., the emergency room, where
children come in more often for failing lungs than for broken
bones, was jumping. Harried nurses barked orders for the pharmacy
to send more drugs. In bed after bed, young faces, all
African-American, were buried under clear plastic breathing masks.
</P>
<P>
   John Thompson, a skinny, bright-eyed 8-year-old, was there,
watching Richard Scarry videos while sniffing steroids to relax his
swollen airways. His mother, who had taken a bus and three subway
trains to get to the hospital, lost her pay that day. She had
already used all her sick leave to care for two asthmatic children.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Mosley, an athletic 13-year-old with a mouthful of braces,
rested quietly in a room around the corner; he had woken up at 4
that morning, gasping for breath.
</P>
<P>
   This is the other inner-city epidemic: asthma. The burden of
AIDS on the poor and minorities has been well documented. Asthma is
less deadly; it claims about 5,000 lives in the United States each
year. Yet the death statistics do not begin to tell the story of
how an unprecedented _ and unexplained _ explosion in asthma cases
is suffocating the nation's poorest urban residents, especially
children.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid rise of asthma, in this country and in developed
nations around the world, is one of the biggest mysteries in modern
medicine. The most striking increases, experts say, have occurred
in Australia, where about one-quarter of all children have received
a diagnosis of asthma.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the number of asthma sufferers has more
than doubled from 6.7 million in 1980 to an estimated 17.3 million
in 1998, according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta. Of these, 4.8 million are children. Experts
say the increase is real. Although doctors do a better job of
diagnosing asthma now than they did in years past, that does not
entirely explain the upward trend.
</P>
<P>
   The epidemic cuts across racial and socioeconomic lines, but
asthma is slightly more prevalent among blacks than among whites.
Scientists suspect that the difference may at least in part be
genetic.
</P>
<P>
   But when public health officials measure rates of hospital
admissions, emergency-room visits and deaths, they find that black
and Hispanic patients, particularly those who are poor, shoulder a
much heavier burden.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows why the disparity is so great, but experts have
some ideas. The poor tend to have less access to regular medical
care, are less able to afford the medications they need and are
more likely to be around environmental ``triggers'' that set off
asthma attacks. Also, some researchers have found, families already
under great stress are less able to cope with the complicated daily
regimen that asthma demands.
</P>
<P>
   Asthma, a chronic, incurable disease of the airways, is
characterized by intermittent episodes of wheezing, coughing and
breathlessness. During normal breathing, air flows freely in and
out of the lungs. But during an asthma attack, the lining of the
airways swells, muscles around the airways tighten and mucus clogs
the tiny air tubes in the lungs, making breathing difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks can be set off by pollen, dust and dust mites,
cockroaches, stress, cold air, tobacco smoke, irritating chemical
smells, mold and mildew, respiratory infections or exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Asthma sufferers can live a normal, unrestricted life, doctors
say, if they get the proper medication and stick to the daily
treatment and monitoring that the disease requires. But many
patients do not get the medical supervision they need or do not
follow their drug regimens properly, and so, despite new and highly
effective drugs to treat the disease, hospital admissions for
asthma are increasing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the most recent year for which the government has
figures, blacks were two to three times as likely to die of asthma
as whites. That same year, African-Americans paid four times as
many visits to emergency rooms for asthma as did whites.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to reverse the trends, the government is stepping
up asthma research. In May, Donna Shalala, the secretary of health
and human services, announced that the department would develop ``a
strategic plan'' for research into the causes of asthma and ways to
lessen the burden on minorities and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   In his proposed budget for next year, President Clinton has
included $50 million in grants for states to test methods for
improving the health of children with asthma who are enrolled in
the Medicaid program. That is in addition to the $118 million the
National Institutes of Health plan to spend on asthma research.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Clinton administration has made eliminating racial
disparities in disease one of its health priorities, asthma is not
on the list of six illnesses the government has identified for the
first five years of the program. That is not because the racial gap
is insignificant, the surgeon general said, but because experts
have no idea how to narrow it within the five years.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, scientists thought diesel exhaust and other
pollutants might be causing the asthma epidemic. Now, they believe
the picture is more complex. To begin with, asthma cases are
surging as pollution levels are declining.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Fernando Martinez, director of the Respiratory Sciences
Center at the University of Arizona in Tucson, said that scientists
in Germany had studied two populations, East and West Germans, with
similar genetic backgrounds but different environments, to
determine whether different living conditions could be associated
with different rates of disease.
</P>
<P>
   Experts had assumed that asthma would be more prevalent in the
more heavily industrialized and polluted East. But the study found
just the opposite. It helped scientists to see that whatever caused
asthma was probably separate from what triggered asthma attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, asthma appears before age 6. ``If we are going to
understand not what triggers asthma but what causes asthma,''
Martinez said, ``we have to look at the first years of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, scientists are focusing on genetics. This month, a team
at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California reported the
discovery of two genes that contribute to the development of
asthma. Researchers are also looking at what happens to the immune
system in early life.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One of the most talked-about new theories is that the rise in
asthma is related to improved hygiene. The idea is that babies are
less likely to be exposed to viruses and bacteria, and without that
exposure, their immune systems do not mature fully. The result is
asthma.
</P>
<P>
   That might explain why people who live on farms, or in rural
areas, are less likely to develop asthma than people in cities.
Perhaps, said Dr. Sonia Buist, an asthma expert at Oregon Health
Sciences University in Portland, it is because people on farms are
more likely to be exposed to soil organisms, and that exposure
somehow immunizes them against asthma.
</P>
<P>
   ``A century ago,'' Dr. Buist said, ``most people walked around
with a load of worms or parasites, and the immune system became
pretty good at dealing with them. As hygiene has increased and the
water system has improved, we have done away with all that priming
of the immune system.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists know that asthma often develops along a pathway;
early in life, the immune system is ``sensitized'' to allergens and
pollutants that trigger asthma attacks. If sensitization never
takes place, they reason, asthma might never occur.
</P>
<P>
   At Columbia University, researchers are trying to determine when
sensitization happens. They are enrolling 480 pregnant women who
will carry air-quality monitors for two days in the third
trimester. Their babies' umbilical-cord blood will be analyzed, and
the infants will be followed for five years to see who develops
asthma.
</P>
<P>
   Until scientists learn more about prevention, doctors and nurses
are left to teach patients how to manage the disease, through
proper medication and changes in their environment.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, federal health officials recommended the daily
use of inhaled corticosteroids to control asthma in people with
moderate or severe disease. But only half the eligible patients use
them, said Dr. William Busse, a professor of medicine at the
University of Wisconsin in Madison who helped write the
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   One reason, Busse said, is that the idea of asthma as a serious
chronic disorder that requires daily medical management is
relatively new, and many doctors have not yet accepted it. Another
is that pediatricians do not like to prescribe, and parents do not
like to give, daily medicine to children, especially steroids,
which can stunt growth and cause other problems in high doses. And
a third is poor health care and inadequate insurance coverage.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The Census Bureau has begun to revise its
definition of what constitutes poverty in the United States,
experimenting with a formula that would drop millions more families
below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau's new approach would in effect raise the income
threshold for living above poverty to $19,500 for a family of four,
from the $16,600 now considered sufficient. Suddenly, 46 million
Americans, or 17 percent of the population, would be recognized as
officially below the line, not the 12.7 percent announced last
month, the lowest level in nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   A strong economy has undoubtedly lifted many families, but not
nearly as many as the official statistics suggest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is certainly our opinion, and the opinion of every
researcher we have talked to, that something should be done to
update the poverty measure,'' said Edward Welniak, chief of the
Census Bureau's Income Statistics Branch.
</P>
<P>
   Fixing a poverty line has always been a subjective endeavor. The
current formula was created for President Lyndon B. Johnson to keep
score in his ``war on poverty'' and has remained unchanged since
1965 except for adjustments to allow for inflation. It is based on
a minimal food budget that no longer represents U.S. eating habits
or spending. The Census Bureau's new Experimental Poverty Measures
are an effort to determine what poor people must really spend on
food, clothing, housing and life's little extras.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no scientific way to set a new poverty line,'' said
Rebecca M. Blank, dean of the School of Public Policy at the
University of Michigan. ``What there is here are a set of judgment
calls, now being made, about what is needed to lift people to a
socially acceptable standard of living.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Sociologists and economists who study what people must earn to
escape poverty in the United States place the line even higher than
the Census Bureau's experimental measures, which were published in
July and are now the focus of a growing debate. They put the
threshold for a family of four somewhere between $21,000 and
$28,000. That is partly because the bureau's criteria, based
largely on a study by the National Academy of Sciences, do not
allow extra cash for emergencies _ to fix a car, say, or repair a
leaky roof, or to buy health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Americans, in opinion polls, draw the poverty line
above $20,000, saying it takes at least that much, if not more, to
``get along in their community,'' to ``live decently'' or to avoid
hardship.
</P>
<P>
   But a higher threshold means government spending would have to
rise to pay for benefits that are tied to the poverty level, like
food stamps and Head Start programs. That would require an
incursion into the budget surplus that neither Republicans nor
Democrats seek.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the White House, which would have to authorize
a change in the poverty formula, is proceeding cautiously. ``We
have at least a couple of years more work to do,'' an
administration official said, passing the decision for redefining
poverty to the next administration.
</P>
<P>
   For Crystal McConnell and Austin Johnson, an Indianapolis
couple, the poverty line, in their view, is definitely north of the
$22,250 they expect to earn this year _ even in Indianapolis, where
incomes and living costs closely match the national average.
</P>
<P>
   The couple do not seem poor. They live in a rented brick
bungalow in a neighborhood of similarly modest, well-kept homes.
The brightly colored plastic toys of their two sons are strewn
about the living room, which is furnished comfortably with
faux-leather sofas placed around a glass and wood coffee table.
</P>
<P>
   But on a recent visit, the refrigerator was nearly empty. Five
small packages of pork chops and chicken parts had to serve as the
centerpiece of family meals for the next 11 days, when there would
again be money to buy food.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go to my mom's after church sometimes for lunch and, during
the week, sometimes for dinner,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 24, and Ms. McConnell, 22, have full-time jobs. As
commuters and workers, occupying a home in a presentable
neighborhood, they hardly fit American images of hardscrabble
lives. But poverty licks at them.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is without health insurance, which he considers beyond
the family's means. Once his provisional job as a load planner _
balancing the weight of cargo loaded onto jet aircraft _ becomes
permanent, company health insurance will kick in. Meanwhile, the
family is going into debt.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McConnell has health insurance from her employer, a
community center where she is a caseworker. But she did not have
insurance last year and still owes a hospital $630 for
emergency-room treatment of her foot, injured in a car accident.
</P>
<P>
   Housing, like health insurance, is a big hurdle. The poor are
twice as likely as the nonpoor to rent rather than own their homes,
according to a Labor Department study.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   That is the pattern in Indianapolis, a city whose housing costs
are right at the median nationally. When the poor do buy homes,
subsidies often grease the way, as they will for Florence Farmer, a
36-year-old single mother of two sons. The West Side Development
Corp., publicly subsidized, is renovating homes in rundown
Indianapolis neighborhoods and then giving away down payments for
them. Not many of the homes are available, but Ms. Farmer managed
to get one for $50,000, qualifying with her medical secretary's
income of $17,000, an amount $4,000 above the official poverty
level for a family her size. Her mortgage payment, $416 a month _
the maximum she says she can afford _ will be almost the same as
what she now pays to rent a two-bedroom house.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Ms. McConnell are struggling to stay in a
neighborhood with a good public school for their elder son, Cyrin,
who is 4. They moved to their three-bedroom bungalow in January,
paying $600 a month in rent, a sum Ms. McConnell says they cannot
really afford. The October rent came due on the first of this month
and was paid, but not the utilities, which were also due. The
couple gambled that gas and electricity would not be cut off before
their next paychecks, in midmonth. The nation's poor are four times
as likely as the nonpoor to have their utilities cut off, the Labor
Department found in its study.
</P>
<P>
   The Indiana Economic Development Council, concerned about the
proliferation of low-wage service jobs, has produced ``basic
needs'' budgets for families here. The council concluded, for
example, that a single parent with one or two children, working
full-time, needs $20,700 to stay out of poverty _ not counting
child care costs.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Schrock, a researcher for the council, which works to
attract companies and new jobs to Indiana, said: ``We have to
understand where the economy is moving in terms of job creation,
and it is unrealistic to think that we will move away from the
creation of lower-wage jobs in the service and hospitality
industries.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Such concerns played no role in creating the poverty formula now
in use. Seeking good numbers in his ``war on poverty,'' Johnson
resisted setting the initial poverty threshold too high. Finally he
approved a formula based on a food budget designed to barely
provide sufficient nutrition _ and then only if ``the housewife is
a careful shopper, a skillful cook and a good manager who will
prepare all the family's meals at home.''
</P>
<P>
   To arrive at a poverty threshold, the bare food budget was
multiplied by three; at the time, food was one-third of the average
family's purchases. Today it is about one-fifth, but neither the
formula nor the original food budget has ever changed.
</P>
<P>
   The new thinking has several facets. It redefines income to
include for the first time noncash income like food stamps and rent
subsidies. It puts child care and other work-related expenses in a
separate category because they vary so much from family to family.
And it tries to determine what a low-income family must spend not
only to survive but to preserve a reasonable amount of
self-respect.
</P>
<P>
   A telephone is considered essential. So is housing in good
repair. Clothing is no longer just to keep warm or covered; looking
decent is a critical status symbol today. That is why Isaac Pinner,
a 16-year-old ninth grader and his sister Lea, 12, and in the
seventh grade, insist they are not poor.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the living room of their rundown rented home with
their mother, Julie Pinner, a 35-year-old receptionist and clerk,
they resent her decision to talk to a reporter about poverty. ``I
get what I want,'' Lea said, and her brother agreed. ``Why talk to
us?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by their clothes, they do not seem poor, although their
mother's income of $15,500, including a rent subsidy, while higher
than the official poverty line for a single mother with two
children, puts the Pinners right at the dividing line in the Census
Bureau's experimental measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think I am richer than I am,'' said Ms. Pinner, who noted
that the gas was turned off recently when she could not pay the
bill. She also lacks money to fix her car.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Ms. Pinner said of her children, ``he wears the latest
Nike brand shoes and she the latest Levi's. I like them to look
nice, and here in the ghetto there are standards of dress. If they
don't dress up to the standards, other kids tend to pick on them. I
am not the only poor person who dresses her kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Most proposed definitions of poverty include a car _ an old one,
to be sure _ which is deemed necessary not only to get to work but
for an occasional outing, or to drive to a supermarket. ``Not
having a car is a big dividing line between the poor and the not so
poor,'' said Christopher Jencks, a sociologist at Harvard's Kennedy
School of government.
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, poor families here own used cars, but they
are often at risk. Austin Johnson, for example, says he cannot
afford car insurance. Neither can Nevada Owens, who is also short
of money to fix a flat tire. She drives her 1985 Delta Oldsmobile
with a spare doughnut tire permanently on the back rear wheel. The
car was a gift from her church, but the cost of gasoline for this
guzzler eats up 7 percent of her $17,300 in annual income.
</P>
<P>
   Her income, from welfare, food stamps, rent and tuition
subsidies and a $3,000 gift from her mother, puts Ms. Owens, a
single mother, and her three children just above the official
poverty line. But at 21, studying to be a licensed practical nurse,
she needs the car. The course work requires her to travel from her
school to two different hospitals, about 25 miles a day.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the Saturday outing in Ms. Owens' old car, which
she drives to her grandfather's home in a rural area outside the
city _ the one family luxury. ``We have a cookout,'' she said,
``and the kids play on the swings and my mother comes over _ she
lives two doors away. We have a good time.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANGDON, N.D. _ Beneath the flat, broad plains of North Dakota,
where the push of a button could have ignited a nuclear attack, the
earth is exploding.
</P>
<P>
   It is the sound of peace.
</P>
<P>
   In a thunderous exclamation point to the end of the Cold War,
some 150 steel and concrete silos, once the launching tunnels of
the nuclear Minuteman III missiles, are being blown to bits by
dynamite.
</P>
<P>
   ``The silos were part of our everyday landscape, social and
physical,'' said Carol Goodman, who farms near one of the missile
sites with her husband, Bernie. ``In so many ways, it set the
rhythm of life in North Dakota. Now they'll be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   To fulfill the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty, the Grand Forks
Air Force Base is overseeing the destruction in North Dakota of
roughly one silo a week for the next three years. The first two
silos were demolished early in October. The nuclear missiles
themselves were removed from 1995 to 1998. In all, 150 silos in
North Dakota will be destroyed, with the next dynamiting scheduled
for Oct. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Veit &AMP; Co., a demolition contractor, is destroying the silos,
which reach more than 60 feet into the earth. Workers lace each
silo with more than 800 pounds of dynamite, ammonia nitrate and
fuel oil.
</P>
<P>
   The first explosion, triggered at a site outside this little
farm town of 2,335 people in northeastern Dakota, about five miles
from the Canadian border, sent chunks of concrete soaring 100 feet
into the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the end of an era,'' said Dick Parrish, a spokesman for
Veit. ``It makes you stop when you think what could have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other Americans, people in North Dakota say they are
grateful that the end of Cold War hostilities has made the nuclear
sites unnecessary. But there has been no small measure of nostalgia
for the arsenal that put prairie towns like Langdon in the center
of world affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In a place accustomed to a familiar, ordered world anchored by
straight, square sections of cropland, the missile program brought
thousands of newcomers from all over the country. Business in North
Dakota, which had been hemorrhaging population since the 1930s,
suddenly boomed: rents soared, schools burgeoned and churches
sprang up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the older people saw it as an invasion,'' said Dawn
Roppel, president of the Langdon School Board, who was a high
school student here when the missile silos were being built. ``But
it was great for business.''
</P>
<P>
   To many North Dakotans, it was a time of social stimulation.
Over a cup of coffee and a piece of rhubarb pie, longtime residents
here would talk with their visitors and learn more about life in
distant regions.
</P>
<P>
   To some people, the concentration of nuclear firepower made
North Dakota a likely target in an enemy attack. But more North
Dakotans saw the missile bases as a shield.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it looked like protection, not a threat,'' said Bill
Verwey, a grain elevator manager and former mayor of nearby Nekoma,
population 102. ``If there was trouble, we were in the best
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, North Dakotans were apt to go along with
whatever the U.S. military deemed necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here are pretty trusting,'' Mrs. Roppel said. ``If the
government tells you it's going to be all right, you believe them.
I don't know if that's trusting or naive.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ominous potential of the missiles was impossible to
deny.
</P>
<P>
   In a public meeting in September 1962, before the the missile
silos were built, a farmer asked an Air Force representative what
effect the launching of missiles would have on his milk cows.
</P>
<P>
   ``None,'' the Air Force spokesman said. ``If these missiles are
launched, we will be at war. The milk cows would be the least of
your problems.''
</P>
<P>
   When the missile unit at Grand Forks was disbanded last year,
the Air Force cut more than 1,700 jobs. It was a bruising blow in a
farm state already hard hit by rock-bottom prices for spring wheat,
oats, barley and other crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't raise $5 wheat and get $3 back,'' Mrs. Goodman said.
``At least, you can't do it for very long.''
</P>
<P>
   Young North Dakotans, whose scores on college admissions tests
routinely rank among the highest in the nation, have done the math.
They continue to leave the state in large numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, my boys would like to stay and farm,'' said Mrs.
Goodman, whose oldest sons went to college to study economics,
preparing lives behind desks. ``It's just not possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The county's population stood at about 6,200 in the 1990 census,
but most officials acknowledge a decline of 800 or 900 people since
then.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for an economic savior, most people here hold out hopes
that a new missile system will be based in North Dakota. The Soviet
Union no longer exists, the North Dakotans say, but other troubles
lurk.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely, the land used for missile sites will be sold for
farmland, said Staff Sgt. Rob Mims in Grand Forks, just as it was
used before the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   For years, farmers would tend crops right up to the fences that
marked the missile sites, riding tractors and combines as they
might anywhere else. The one difference, though, was that a
uniformed airman stood watch nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd be plowing, and look over to see the airman with a gun,
watching you, watching you all the time,'' said Mrs. Roppel. ``That
could give you the heebie-jeebies.''

   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE POP-UP BOOK OF PHOBIAS'' &QL; 
By Gary Greenberg (Morrow, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We heard about this one before we saw it, and that's always a
good sign. It has been New &AMP; Notable's policy to mock pop-up books
on the grounds that they are both silly and oxymoronic _ something
can't pop up and be a book at the same time. We prefer to think of
them as ````gadgets''.'' The last one we paid any attention to was
about golf courses, and it might have been the nadir of pop-up
books _ little greens rising at you like some dopey delusion, sand
traps floating through the air. So, when we got wind of this one,
we licked our chops, found ``moronic'' in the thesaurus and waited
for the kill. Now, we must eat crow. New &AMP; Notable has been
conquered by a pop-up book, wrestled into submission by a gadget.
Gary Greenberg, the stand-up comedian who created it, begins with
the mother of all phobias, the Dentist and the Drill. This
particular drill twists as it rises into view, and it is big enough
to roto-rooter your nostril. When it reaches dead center, it is
aimed straight at you, right at your very teeth, and behind it is a
dentist who bears more than a passing resemblance to Joseph
Mengele. You have to laugh _ what else can you do? Greenberg has
paired off the ludicrous and the macabre, and we couldn't wait to
turn the page and see what he'd do next. There are 10 phobias here,
including most of the big ones, but we won't say more. The
dentist's drill is funny whether you know it's coming or not, but
others profit from an element of surprise. Either way, phobias beat
golf courses, hands down. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``DOGS THAT KNOW WHEN THEIR OWNERS ARE COMING HOME'' &QL; 
By Rupert Sheldrake (Crown, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Surely, Sheldrake is preaching to the converted when he makes
the case for studying our own pets (and not just creatures in
research labs) to foster our awareness of ``the unexplained powers
of animals.'' After all, the people most likely to buy his book are
those who agree with him, who object to our longstanding taboo
against taking pets seriously. There's nevertheless something
heartwarming about his arguments, which embrace the animals we love
as both gifted creatures and sources of scientific knowledge.
Through interviews and surveys with pet owners, veterinarians, dog
trainers and zoo keepers in the United States and Britain,
Sheldrake explores the phenomenon of telepathic communication
between people and animals _ in other words, he asks why a dog
might know 20 minutes in advance that its owner is coming home,
even when the owner is unexpected. Or how a cat hearing a ringing
telephone would know that someone it loves is on the other end of
the line. What makes an animal show unmistakable signs of agitation
a full three hours before an earthquake, or enables a horse to find
its way home across unfamiliar terrain? And why, if there are some
dogs that know their owners are coming home, are there other dogs
that don't have a clue? Are some breeds more sensitive than others?
Sheldrake explores animal empathy, the therapeutic effect of pets,
animal-to-animal telepathy, the phenomenon of bird migration, and
animal premonitions. His book is an engaging look at domesticated
creatures and the mysterious things that connect us to them. &QL; 
``PLAINSONG'' &QL; 
By Kent Haruf (Knopf, $24) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This lovely, evocative novel is set in Holt, Colo., a prairie
town so small that it takes only an hour for two boys to deliver
all of its newspapers. Those boys are Ike and Bobby Guthrie, whose
father, Tom, teaches history at the high school, and whose mother,
Ella, has taken silently to her bed and will soon move out of the
house and then out of town altogether. Other characters are
Victoria Roubideaux, a pregnant teenage girl whose mother has
locked her out of the house, and the senior McPheron brothers, two
self-described decrepit old bachelors who agree to let Victoria
come and live with them on their farm until her baby is born. Haruf
lets his characters reveal themselves slowly and compassionately,
and the story that takes shape as the ties between them grow is
oddly comforting even as they grapple with changes in their lives.
The feel of this book is not unlike that of Cormac McCarthy's later
novels, both in tone and in the atmospheric sense of place that
becomes almost a character in itself (missing is McCarthy's
trademark violence, although there is one menacing scene in which
Ike and Bobby are roughed up by a teenage bully). Haruf has written
a quietly moving book about ordinary people dealing with the
emotional twists of ordinary life. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``BROTHERS'' &QL; 
(Hyperion, $26.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Writing about my brothers is a dangerous occupation, dancing
through a minefield,'' Frank McCourt says. Maybe so, but there's
something to be said for having tissues on hand if you intend to
read this book _ you might get weepy. There are some fine writers
here _ McCourt, Tobias Wolff, Richard Ford, David Sedaris, James
Alan McPherson _ all talking about their brothers and the bonds and
conflicts between them. We were most taken, however, with the essay
by Charles P. Pierce, who is the son of a brother and the father of
brothers, but who himself is an only child. His is the clear-eyed
view from beyond: ``I have watched brothers all my life,'' he says.
``I watched them in my family growing up, and I watch my children
today, the blood speech of the code-talkers in the other bedrooms,
the swift bursts of anger and the reconciliations, all operating on
rules as foreign and distant to me as Hammurabi's Code.'' Mixed
with these essays are portraits of brothers, some well-known (the
Dalai Lama and his brother, Martin Scorsese and his), some not at
all. This was put together by the editors of ``Esquire.'' &QL;

FLOOZ GETS HELP FROM WHOOPI GOLDBERG  
 A BEAUTY ON THE BOARD  
 Y2K WARRIORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Va.)  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The actress Whoopi Goldberg has just signed on to be the chief
promoter of a form of online gift currency. By using her celebrity
in exchange for stock in the company, Ms. Goldberg adds her name to
a list of cyberrepresentatives that already includes the former
``Star Trek'' actor William Shatner and the tennis star Anna
Kournikova.
</P>
<P>
   The Goldberg deal involves ads on television, radio and
billboards that feature the actress promoting Flooz, a new
Web-based gift certificate system that the company with the same
name hopes will someday become a household word.
</P>
<P>
   The company gets its name from a slang term for money in the
Mediterranean region, according to Robert Levitan, co-founder of
Flooz Inc., which is based in New York. Previously, Levitan was
co-founder of the iVillage online network for women.
</P>
<P>
   Flooz works much like any gift certificate except that it is
redeemable only online, at least for now. Some 60 online merchants
have already signed up as stores that accept Flooz, including
Godiva chocolates, Tower Records and Fogdog Sports. Eventually,
Levitan said, people will also be able to redeem Flooz in
conventional stores.
</P>
<P>
   To give Flooz, someone enters a credit card number in a form on
the Flooz.com Web site and specifies how much they want to give.
Flooz then establishes a Flooz account in the recipient's name and
notifies the recipient of the gift by e-mail. The recipient then
receives a Flooz account number, which can be used for making
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Levitan said the company approached Ms. Goldberg because her
public image was consistent with that of Flooz.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both irreverent, hip and fun but also trusted and
respectable brands,'' Levitan said. In exchange for lending her
name to Flooz's ad campaign, Ms. Goldberg has become the company's
largest shareholder outside its founding circle and financing
group, Levitan said, declining to discuss specific figures.

   Trying to Draw Eyes to a New Web Site
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of cybercelebrities, Cindy Crawford, who has turned
heads on the fashion runway, will now try to draw eyes to a Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   The model has been named to the board and given stock in Estyle
Inc., a privately held start-up that sells baby goods and clothing
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie McCartney, founder and president of the Los Angeles
company, insisted that Ms. Crawford was not acting as a mere
celebrity spokeswoman but as a bona fide strategic partner,
advising on strategy and using her contacts with designers. ``We
really see her as a very savvy, very smart businesswoman,'' Ms.
McCartney said.
</P>
<P>
   The company's Web site, babystyle.com, includes Cindy's Corner,
in which the model writes of her favorite fashionable maternity
clothes and recommends baby products based on her three and a half
months of experience as a first-time mother.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Crawford, 33, agreed to join Estyle when she was approached
while pregnant. ``Being really in the moment of that, I really
believe in the project,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being an experienced businesswoman, though, Ms.
Crawford said she was learning a lot from board room discussions
about distribution, fulfillment and different classes of stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my business college,'' said Ms. Crawford, adding that
her modeling jobs at Revlon and other places rarely gave her the
chance to participate in business decisions. ``Occasionally, I get
to put my 2 cents in about where the advertising should go,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Crawford is also on the board of 24 Hour Fitness, a health
club chain, and has her own fan Web site, cindy.com. She said
models must make preparations while they are in their prime for
when they are older and no longer in high demand.
</P>
<P>
   Strategic partnering aside, some of Ms. Crawford's duties at
Estyle cannot seem unfamiliar. Last week, she walked down a red
carpet as hostess at the company's coming-out party.
</P>
<P>
   _ ANDREW POLLACK
</P>
<P>
   Brief Flurry Over Year 2000 Bug
</P>
<P>
   Activists calling for more aggressive preparations for Year 2000
computer disruptions have been extremely frustrated at the general
apathy they have encountered and, as a result, the increasing
difficulty of getting media coverage for their message.
</P>
<P>
   That frustration boiled over on Oct. 3 in San Francisco, where a
small protest group, despairing of getting attention for their
concerns about Year 2000 readiness of nuclear power and weapons
systems, decided to parade naked through downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The brief march was led by Dr. Patch Adams, the iconoclastic
physician who inspired the recent movie based on his life, and
Helen Caldicott, a noted figure in the antinuclear movement. It
slowed traffic, made headlines and was ignored by police. It also
generated plenty of conversation among Year 2000 campaigners
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more extended reflections came from Jay Golter,
acting president of the Northern Virginia Y2K Community Action
Group, who apparently has not lost his sense of humor despite the
many months of being ignored by most of his neighbors. In his
organization's latest newsletter, Golter wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Many aspects of Y2K organizing have been demoralizing. In my
own case, when our group started, I had suspected that I had a face
made for radio. When I had the opportunity to call in to the WAMU
radio show `Public Interest' during a program they did on Y2K, I
could listen to the audio file of that program. I then realized
that I have a voice made to be a writer. However, an entire
lifetime of experiences has led me to understand that I have a
physique made to be fully clothed.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, after describing the news from San Francisco and referring
the newsletter's readers to Web sites with further coverage, Golter
concluded: ``I still believe that nudity is a weapon in our public
relations arsenal that should remain sheathed. However, if any of
you decide otherwise, be sure to let me know in advance where and
when you will be demonstrating this large `measure of devotion' to
the cause. I'll be the guy wearing dark glasses, or a mask, or a
bag over my face, or...''

GIANTS HOPE TO REVERSE MONDAY NIGHT FORTUNES AGAINST AN OLD
NEMESIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Dallas Cowboys have not been a welcome sight, and ``Monday
Night Football'' has not been a welcome forum during the past three
decades of Giants football.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1970, the Cowboys have won two-thirds of the meetings
between the teams. Frequently, by a lopsided score. The Giants,
meanwhile, have not won on ``Monday Night Football'' in five years.
They have, in fact, rarely played well across 29 years on Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   With the Giants struggling, a confluence of the two _ Dallas on
Monday night _ may not be what the Giants need right now. But the
National Football League schedule makers can be cruel.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, they team up these longtime rivals. The Giants
(2-3), desperate for a victory, have never beaten Dallas (3-1) on
``Monday Night Football.'' Ever.
</P>
<P>
   Not in seven attempts dating to 1971.
</P>
<P>
   And in those seven games, the Giants have been outscored by
188-82.
</P>
<P>
   If this is a developing complex for the Giants, coach Jim Fassel
and his players aren't letting on.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I think and worry about those things,'' he said with a thin
smile, ``it'll make me nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel wasn't sure he was even going to mention to his players
the history between the clubs on the NFL's biggest regular-season
showcase.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I tell these guys, here's the record on Monday night _ it's
got to change,'' Fassel said. ``Do I want them to be walking around
going: `Oh and seven, oh and seven?'
</P>
<P>
   ``That sets them back mentally. You're right, I guess you can't
ignore it. But then again, I'm not going to make a big deal of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Giants linebacker Jessie Armstead didn't know the Giants had
failed to beat the Cowboys in a Monday night game, but it doesn't
shock him either.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're America's Team,'' Armstead said of the Cowboys.
``Maybe they've got our number on `Monday Night Football.' But it
ain't got in my head. I doubt it's in anybody's head. You go out
and play football.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers might not matter if the Giants hadn't played so
poorly on national, prime-time television in general lately. The
Giants haven't won on prime-time television since 1995, which is
another 0-7 streak.
</P>
<P>
   They have been outscored in those games, 169-92.
</P>
<P>
   It has been suggested to the Giants that teams like the Cowboys
that play more often on national television might be more
accustomed to the experience. The Cowboys have won 11 of their past
15 times on Monday night. Overall, they have played on Monday night
56 times, more than any team except Miami, which has made 62
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' Monday night record is 33-23.
</P>
<P>
   But quarterback Kent Graham had a twist on that theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a reason those teams are on `Monday Night Football'
more often,'' Graham said. ``They're good teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel had a variation on the same theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like that old saying in football,'' the coach said.
``People ask: `How do you win on the road?' The answer: Take a good
team with you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants seem eager to play on the Monday night stage, even if
it hasn't been kind to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know everybody is watching,'' defensive end Michael
Strahan said. ``All your friends are at home watching. I think it's
great _ the Cowboys, national television. We might need something
like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not surprisingly, most successful Giants seasons in the
past three decades, including some of their most memorable ones,
have included Giants victories over the Cowboys _ especially a
sweep of the two games the teams play every year.
</P>
<P>
   The only times the Giants swept the season series with the
Cowboys this decade was in 1997 and 1990. The Giants won the NFC
East each season.
</P>
<P>
   Other times the Giants have won both games against Dallas: 1962,
1963, 1984 and 1988 and 1989. The Giants went to the NFL
championship game in 1962 and 1963; they qualified for the playoffs
for the first time in 21 years in 1984, and they won the division
in 1989. In 1988, the Giants won 10 games but didn't make the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But there is an ominous flip side to measuring the Giants by the
Cowboys. Excluding the Giants early-season victory over the Cowboys
in 1997, the teams' first meeting of each season since 1990 has
been a Dallas victory.
</P>
<P>
   If you add the scores of those games: Dallas 217, Giants 70.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel might be right. Mentioning the history between these
clubs might not be a good idea for his team.

KNICKS STRUGGLING WITH AN OLD PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. _ The same New York Knicks who nearly collapsed
under selfish play last season have been giving in to their
spotlight cravings again, running the court as if they were models
on a runway.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, they came prancing down the floor here on Saturday
night, looking to woo everyone with their spinning, brazen moves to
the basket. Whether it was Latrell Sprewell flying in against three
Cleveland Cavaliers defenders only to have his circus shot blocked,
or John Wallace careening through the paint without a passing
thought, the Knicks showed how quick they are to fall back on their
old me-first habits.
</P>
<P>
   So far, this style has the Knicks beginning their defense of the
Eastern Conference title with preseason losses to Philadelphia and
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our two problems are work, and playing together,'' coach Jeff
Van Gundy said after the Knicks shot 34.8 percent, and allowed the
Cavaliers to shoot 45.7 percent, in an 82-68 loss. ``So we've gone
through this before.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, it took the dismissal of general manager Ernie
Grunfeld and nearly missing the playoffs to snap the Knicks to
attention and change their ways. At least for the moment, the
Knicks have forgotten how they found each other along the path to
the NBA finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at this point either we think we're better than we are
or we think we're going to play well just because we practice hard
or we talk about things,'' said Allan Houston, who led the team
with 17 points on 5-for-12 shooting. ``We have a sense of everyone
trying to contribute, but they're trying to do it in the wrong way.
When we play good, we play unselfishly and play together. On both
ends, we're not doing that. It's a secondary thought instead of a
primary thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite rule changes designed to nudge scores higher, the Knicks
have averaged just 73 points in their two losses. Against
Cleveland's second and third teams, the core group of Houston,
Sprewell, Kurt Thomas, Marcus Camby and Charlie Ward lost ground in
the last four minutes by forcing shots, failing to pass and going
for the big steal instead of the smart defensive play.
</P>
<P>
   No one looked more out of sync than Sprewell. After being named
the starter at small forward before the game, Sprewell, in his
first action of the preseason, did not pass up a shot no matter how
ill advised. He ended the night 5 for 19 with 10 points over 40
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you want to call it overanxious,'' said
Sprewell, who had driving layups blocked twice in the first half.
``Whatever it is, I need to make that adjustment. I usually get
space when I go up. It's preseason. I have time to make the
adjustment.''

LUCAS STARTS, STARS, FALTERS AND GETS HURT AS JETS FALL TO COLTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ In this season of the unthinkable for
the New York Jets, they lost another game Sunday , another
quarterback, and, apparently, any realistic chance of salvaging the
campaign that many fans believed would end at the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Lucas discovered at 10:30 Sunday morning he would be
starting his first National Football League game at quarterback,
while Rick Mirer was shocked to learn he was benched just as he was
preparing to suit up.
</P>
<P>
   ``How was I supposed to know my job was in jeopardy?'' asked
Mirer.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas led the usually moribund Jet offense to a 13-0 lead over
the fast-improving Colts.
</P>
<P>
   But as time ran out, with the Colts leading by 16-13 following a
series of Jets' errors, Lucas desperately scrambled and was hauled
down. And then a 292-pound defender rolled over his left ankle.
Lucas is now lost with a sprained ankle for at least next week's
game at Oakland, the Jets have fallen to 1-5, they are 0-3 in their
division and Mirer will get the ball back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's really hard for me right now to express how bad I
feel about what's going on,'' said coach Bill Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I can say that hurt us other than the obvious
interception were penalties.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas will be the seventh Jets' starter to be sidelined at least
a game because of an injury. Despite his losing effort, he did
provide the spark that Parcells needed to kindle an offense that
had not produced a touchdown in two of Mirer's four starts after he
took over from the injured Vinny Testaverde.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the change, which he said he didn't decide on until
Saturday night, Parcells replied, ``I thought we could get impetus,
which we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, at the end, it was Lucas' inexperience that put the Colts
in position to kick the winning field goal after an offside on a
Colts' punt had allowed the visitors to keep alive a drive that
tied the game.
</P>
<P>
   These pivotal plays sank the Jets, who have hung on because of
their defense the last two weeks. But there is no resiliency now on
the club to overcome errors. They have been in a funk since losing
quarterback Vinny Testaverde in the opening game.
</P>
<P>
   Leading 13-10 in the closing seconds of the third quarter, the
Jets lined up for the expected Colts' punt on fourth-and-three. But
Jason Ferguson lined up offsides. The 5-yard penalty kept the drive
alive.
</P>
<P>
   Peyton Manning moved them to the 1, the defense halted
Indianapolis, but Mike Vanderjagt's 18-yard field goal tied the
score.
</P>
<P>
   Two drives later, though, Lucas, who had been stymied much of
the game after the early lead, started to hand the ball to Curtis
Martin. Five straight runs brought the Jets to the Indianapolis 3.
It was first down. Victory loomed _ a victory that would have at
least put the Jets in position to get to .500 by midseason.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells called for a pass play. The Jets have not been very
good on fourth-and-one and third-and-short near the goal line all
season. That is why, said Parcells, he called for the pass.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas saw Keyshawn Johnson in the end zone. But instead of
tossing it high enough out of harm's way to the 6-foot 3-inch
Johnson, the inexperienced Lucas _ he had thrown seven passes in
his career before Sunday _ sailed one chest-high to the big
receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Jeff Burris got to it before Johnson, and picked it
off at the goal line while Johnson waited. Burris returned it 55
yards. It set up Vanderjagt's winning 27-yard field goal with 14
seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the Jets' last chance and Lucas' sack by defensive
tackle Ellis Johnson, who landed on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I blew it with the interception,'' Lucas said later from the
trainer's room. ``Life goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a crushing denouement to a game that had started brightly
and dramatically for a couple of New Jersey guys.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas (from Harrison) and Wayne Chrebet (Garfield) grew up 15
minutes apart. Lucas was getting the benefit of Chrebet's first
start of the season following his broken left foot in an exhibition
game.
</P>
<P>
   The very first play of the game was a pass to Johnson for 18,
but by halftime Lucas had connected with Chrebet five times. For a
change, the punchless Jets were punching out first downs and
converting on third.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Lucas led them across midfield the first five times
they had the ball. They needed points to have breathing room
against the American Conference's highest-scoring team.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' opening drive resulted in a 43-yard field-goal attempt
by John Hall that hit the left upright. The next drive led to a
45-yard Hall field goal and a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Hall kicked still another one, from 39 yards, and it was 6-0. On
the opening drive of the second period Lucas and Martin led the
Jets to the Colts' 18, from where Lucas threw his first big-league
touchdown _ to Richie Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   It was now 13-0 before the Colts mounted any offense. This they
did quickly, with Manning drilling a 22-yard scoring pass to
Terrence Wilkins.
</P>
<P>
   Back came the Jets, down to the 37 _ close enough for the
strong-footed Hall to attempt a field goal. But on a third-down run
Martin was tackled for a 7-yard loss.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas was unable to do much the rest of the game, but the
defense and special teams kept the Jets' on the verge of victory.
</P>
<P>
   After a first half in which he hit on 14 of 19 passes, Lucas
connected on only two of his last 11. He didn't find Chrebet in the
second half. Martin's best rushing day of the season _ 23 carries
for 128 yards _ failed to take them far enough.

   CETINJE, Montenegro _ With its economy spinning toward disaster,
tiny Montenegro is close to taking one more formal step toward
independence from Slobodan Milosevic's Yugoslavia: the
establishment of its own currency.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview here, Montenegro's democratic-minded president,
Milo Djukanovic, a former protege of Milosevic, said last week that
Montenegro would create a second currency tied to the German mark
within days if Belgrade formally devalued the Yugoslav dinar. In
the last month alone, the dinar has lost at least 15 percent of its
value against the German mark on the black market.
</P>
<P>
   For two years now, Djukanovic has been moving toward separating
Montenegro, famous for its mountain monasteries and Adriatic
coastal resorts, from the authoritarian Serbia of Milosevic.
Montenegro will become an independent state, he said, if Serbian
officials ``adhere to their retrograde path of self-isolation.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Djukanovic is apparently as reluctant as Milosevic to
bring matters to a confrontation. While his officials privately
exude assurance that Montenegro will become independent, Djukanovic
talks publicly of ``democratization and decentralization,'' not
independence or secession.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Montenegro in August offered the Yugoslav
government negotiations on a more equal relationship within
Yugoslavia as a commonwealth, with Montenegro maintaining its own
army and currency. After stalling more than two months, Milosevic's
governing party agreed to talks with Djukanovic's party _ rather
less than the government-to-government talks Montenegro seeks.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Montenegrin officials say privately that Milosevic cannot
delay forever and that they expect a referendum on independence by
the end of February.
</P>
<P>
   Nervous senior Western diplomats and officials worry that this
is a lull before a storm, and that Milosevic may provoke civil
strife inside Montenegro or even use his army to crush any move
toward independence before a referendum, creating another crisis to
divert the Serbian population.
</P>
<P>
   Strife is possible even without Milosevic's manipulations.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the outward confidence of the Djukanovic government,
there is significant support inside Montenegro, a land of just
650,000 people, for maintaining relations with Serbia and for
Milosevic himself. Djukanovic only narrowly won the presidency in
1997 over his former best friend, Momir Bulatovic, who remains a
staunch Milosevic ally.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic's party and its allies triumphed in parliamentary
elections in 1998, but Milosevic continues to give Bulatovic's
defeated Socialist People's Party Montenegro's premiership in the
federal government and seats in the federal Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Polls indicate that at least 40 percent of Montenegro's
population is against breaking ties with Serbia, with about the
same percentage favoring independence. A major Djukanovic campaign
for a yes vote would probably produce a majority, but as Djukanovic
himself said, ``Who could be happy with 40 percent against?''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Much of the pro-Serbian, pro-Milosevic support is concentrated
in the north of the republic, leading some officials here to worry
that Milosevic might try to engineer a local rebellion leading to
partition.
</P>
<P>
   Some Montenegrin officials suggest that Milosevic might actually
prefer a final breakup of Yugoslavia because that would allow him
to draw up a new constitution permitting him to run again for
office. His current term as Yugoslav president ends in mid-2001 and
cannot be extended.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, following Milosevic's pattern, Djukanovic has
strong control over the state media and has built up a reasonably
well-armed police force of some 12,000 men, roughly matching the
size of the Yugoslav army garrisoned in Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   During the NATO bombing this spring, Montenegro was spared some
of the destruction, but Yugoslav army and naval installations were
hit hard, and there were tensions between the army and the police.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegrin officials say they have no intention of causing a
war or a crisis, but privately they are committed to an independent
state, which would complete the breakup of Tito's Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``We know how to listen,'' said Dragisa Burzan, the deputy prime
minister. ``We can be careful and cautious. But we are in a
difficult interregnum with no protections.'' He predicted
independence within a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Foreign Minister, Branko Perovic, said, ``We do not want to
stir things up, but we want to set things right.'' He said that all
proposals have deadlines and that he did not expect negotiations
with the government in Belgrade and any independence referendum to
go much past next April.
</P>
<P>
   While the current stalemate may suit both Milosevic and
Djukanovic for now, no one regards the situation as stable.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is opposed to Montenegrin
independence. This month, State Department spokesman James Rubin
praised local leaders for ``a measured and rational approach to
political and economic reform'' within Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   While Montenegro has some way to go before becoming a real, open
democratic polity, the changes here are already having an impact in
Serbia, and opposition politicians on the run from Belgrade find a
welcome here.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials say they want
``predictability,'' not any new crisis that would provoke Milosevic
into military action. NATO's promise during the war over Kosovo to
defend Montenegro has not been renewed.
</P>
<P>
   Perovic, the Montenegrin foreign minister, said he understood
the U.S. position against independence, but noted, ``No one has
taken away our right to self-determination.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Talk of independence aside, the root of Montenegro's troubles is
its economy, which is just 5 percent of Yugoslavia's war- and
sanctions-shattered economy. The Kosovo war further reduced
Montenegro's tourist trade, which has come to consist largely of
Serbs _ who have less money to spend than western Europeans _ and
investment is tiny. Unemployment is nearly 80 percent, said an
independent economist, Nebojsa Medojevic.
</P>
<P>
   But the formal economy is propped up by corruption,
sanctions-busting and smuggling, for which Montenegro has long been
famous. It is a popular spot for smuggling cigarettes to an
addicted market in Italy, three hours across the Adriatic in fast
``cigarette boats.'' The Mafia is deeply embedded in the trade,
according to local legend and reports in the Italian media.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said smuggling totals no more than $40 million or so a
year, but that is an important source of income for this tiny place
and helps cover the budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro's size and close family and clan ties create other
problems of crony capitalism. One large aluminum factory, Podgorica
Aluminum Kombinat, represents about 50 percent of the gross
national product. A Swiss company now leases it from a local
holding company called Vektra, which diplomats believe is a front
for the governing elite. The United States wants the contract
broken, and Montenegrin officials promise a better privatization
process to come.
</P>
<P>
   But as a part of Yugoslavia and under international sanctions,
Montenegro is still denied access to institutions like the World
Bank and International Monetary Fund, which could provide loans,
advice and oversight. The West is reconsidering that ban, as it has
lifted other bans on air travel and fuel supplies to Montenegro,
but not Serbia.

child for sex by use of a computer. Here are excerpts from their

 &HT;    Online offenders lure youth for sex talk, acts
 &HT;    By Susan Spencer-Wendel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In the courtroom, Calvin Dodd, sporting
a charcoal suit, maroon paisley tie and wire-rimmed glasses, fit
the profile: Internet-fed sex offender.
</P>
<P>
   When the 43-year-old professional pleaded guilty last month, he
joined a growing group of clean-cut men with clean criminal records
caught in Internet dragnets. More and more, their online plans to
meet young girls and boys are being foiled by police learning to
use the Net just as well as those who abuse it.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly kept in check by their social or professional lives,
the men now sit home browsing through an enormous selection of
child pornography.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are out there lying in wait, having never been tickled
like that before,'' sexologist Susan LaFehr Hession said.
</P>
<P>
   The tickling of Dodd, who told the court he worked at Office
Depot's corporate headquarters, took place at the computer in his
Boynton Beach bedroom. There, police say, he downloaded child
pornography and began exchanging messages with someone he believed
to be a 13-year-old girl. The girl was really a Palm Beach Gardens
police detective.
</P>
<P>
   In their first online chat, Dodd began describing what he'd like
to do to ``her'' and, of course, vice versa, according to police
records. Soon, the two planned a rendezvous at a Shoney's parking
lot.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd missed the meeting. He later told the girl via computer
that his car's water pump broke. Nonetheless, police got a warrant
to search his home, seized his computer and found sexually explicit
computer photo files. They also found the receipt for the repaired
water pump.
</P>
<P>
   James Fortier of West Palm Beach, a development assistant at the
Kravis Center, had a similar case, except his car was working just
fine.
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon in February, the 40-year-old _ known as
``thefortres'' on America Online _ drove to a local Publix to meet
his new AOL acquaintance, ``sagster002.'' Online, sagster002,
supposedly a 15-year-old boy, had sounded eager to have sex.
Fortier promised to bring some beer and let the teen drive the car.
</P>
<P>
   Fortier parked his maroon Honda Accord with tinted windows in an
empty part of the lot and waited for the introduction. What he got
was: ``Detective Mike Bowman, Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE THAN `JUST TALKING DIRTY'
</P>
<P>
   Inside the sheriff's office complex, the ``tickling'' detectives
work in a windowless, cool room. Two years ago, the Computer Crimes
Unit had three unsophisticated desktops. Now, there are file
servers galore, forensic diagnostic machines, compact disc writing
machines, and laptops dotting desks all around.
</P>
<P>
   This is where the unit's detectives, Sean Fitzpatrick and David
Hill, log onto various Internet service providers to go ``fishing''
_ dangling their assumed identities as children in places where
sharks will bite.
</P>
<P>
   Once someone engages them in conversation, they begin to tiptoe
the legal line between expressing interest in sex and actually
proposing it. One of the exchanges between Fortier and the officer
(sagster002) went like this:
</P>
<P>
   sagster002: I bet you can teach me alot
</P>
<P>
   thefortres: yes I can.....do you want to learn?
</P>
<P>
   sagster002: I know alot
</P>
<P>
   sagster002: i'm trying to find my friend i met on here last week
</P>
<P>
   sagster002: he was 36
</P>
<P>
   thefortres: cool......did you 2 get together?
</P>
<P>
   sagster002: yep twice
</P>
<P>
   sagster002: he picked me up at school
</P>
<P>
   thefortres: did you have sex?
</P>
<P>
   sagster002: yepper
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing is remembering I'm a 12-year-old girl,'' the
30-year-old Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   He reads Teen Beat magazine, listens to rap artists such as DMX
and Outcast, and talks with teens whenever he can. Fitzpatrick says
watching television is a great help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gotta be able to say `Oh my God! Brittany broke her leg!'''
the 33-year-old detective said.
</P>
<P>
   But Dodd said after his recent court hearing that he suspected
it might be a police officer. Phrases such as ``Can you expand on
that?'' tipped him off, he said.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't stop him, though. ``I didn't think I was doing
anything wrong. I was just talking dirty,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   CATCHING THE CULPRITS
</P>
<P>
   But for all the parking lot trysts police foil, an untold number
take place.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Coleman of Lake Worth _ ``SHAWN4LOVE'' on America Online
_ met his 11-year-old victim by chatting on AOL. The well-tailored,
clean-cut 25-year-old found out where she lived, and the two made
plans for him to visit her one January afternoon when there was no
school and her mother was at work, according to police records.
</P>
<P>
   The girl invited him into her bedroom. They looked at photo
albums, he offered to give her a massage and then proceeded to
commit three sexual acts considered felonies.
</P>
<P>
   When Coleman was arrested in February and questioned about
another girl he met online and had sex with, he said that he wasn't
sure of the girl's name because ``there had been so many.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people prosecuted in Internet cases by the Crimes
Against Children unit of the state attorney's office are like Dodd
and Fortier: men who arranged on the Internet to meet a child and
instead meet an officer. Offenders such as Coleman, caught after
the fact, are far fewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there are kids meeting up,'' said the unit's head,
Chuck Burton. ``It's just the tip of the old iceberg.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority of cases prosecuted have ended in plea agreements.
Neither Dodd, Fortier or Coleman went to trial, presumably because
of the considerable evidence against them.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd and Fortier were put on sex-offender probation: Dodd for
three years, Fortier for five. Their probation includes registering
as a sexual offender, having no contact with children unless in the
presence of an adult who knows they are a sex offender and
restricting their access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman pleaded guilty to six felonies involving two girls and
could receive a sentence of 21 years. He remains free on a $75,000
bond until his January sentencing and is under the same
restrictions as Dodd and Fortier when it comes to contact with
children.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman is taking a chemical castration drug as part of
treatment he hopes will reduce his sentence.

A GAIN FOR ARABS IN EAST JERUSALEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Interior Minister Natan Sharansky announced Sunday
that he had ended an Israeli policy that had stripped thousands of
Palestinians from East Jerusalem of their right to live there.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups and Palestinians have condemned the practice
as a ``quiet deportation'' that they say was intended to curb Arab
population growth in East Jerusalem, whose future is to be
determined in talks between Israel and the Palestinians on a
permanent peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an impractical policy that served no purpose, and I'm
very happy that today we are stopping the policy,'' Sharansky said
in a radio interview. ``As someone who believes that Jerusalem must
remain under Israeli sovereignty, we must look after the human
rights of all citizens, including those who live in East
Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel says East Jerusalem, captured from Jordan in the 1967
Arab-Israeli war and later annexed, will remain part of its
indivisible capital. The Palestinians claim the area as the capital
of their hoped-for state.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1967 the Interior Ministry has stripped about 5,400
Palestinians of their residency rights in Jerusalem, according to
Interior Ministry figures. This has restricted their entry to the
city and deprived them of Israeli health insurance and social
security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The figures show that about half of the actions were taken in
the last three years, when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
rightist government was in power.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians who had moved to West Bank suburbs of East
Jerusalem in search of housing, or who had traveled abroad for
studies or work and could not prove that they had been in the city
for seven consecutive years, were told that their residence had
been revoked and were ordered to leave.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry asserted that by moving their ``center of life''
outside East Jerusalem, they had lost the permanent resident status
granted by Israel to the city's 200,000 Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   But Sharansky declared in his remarks that those days were now
over. ``The Interior Ministry is beginning to carry out a new
policy, under which we will not search how many years a Jerusalem
resident was in Jerusalem and how many years he was absent,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who wish to continue to be residents of the city,''
Sharansky said, ``but in the past spent a few years in Kuwait or
other countries where they were working _ we do not use the pretext
that they were not here to cancel their residency.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials welcomed the policy change and urged
Sharansky to restore East Jerusalem residency to Palestinians whose
rights had been revoked.
</P>
<P>
   Ziyad Abu Zayyad, a representative of East Jerusalem in the
Palestinian legislative council, said the new Israeli policy would
ease the daily hardships of his constituents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has humanitarian meaning,'' Abu Zayyad said. ``I hope this
will put an end to the policy of ethnic cleansing of Jerusalem.''

HUARD COMES OFF BENCH TO LEAD DOLPHINS OVER PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. _ It was early in the first quarter when Miami
quarterback Dan Marino flicked an 8-yard strike to wide receiver
Tony Martin. That play against the New England Patriots put Marino
over 60,000 passing yards for his career, making him the first
player to surpass that mark. Unfortunately, it was about the only
good thing Marino did all day.
</P>
<P>
   Age is clearly beginning to catch up with the 38-year-old
quarterback as his body slowly keeps breaking down. He was long
gone, sidelined with shoulder pain, by the time his replacement
rallied Miami to a 31-30 victory over the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Marino was suffering from muscle spasms in his
shoulder and neck area, and those pains continued into Sunday
afternoon against a solid Patriots defense. When a pass would leave
Marino's hands, it would die a quick death, taking a rapid dive
into the grass, like a pigeon trying to navigate a hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was throwing change-ups,'' Marino said, ``and usually I
throw fast balls.''
</P>
<P>
   What became clear early in the game, after the Dolphins fell
behind 14-0, was that there would be no miraculous Marino comeback.
Instead, Marino's injury made it possible for his backup, Damon
Huard, to play the role of Superman.
</P>
<P>
   Damon who?
</P>
<P>
   This season has seen more quarterbacks come out of nowhere than
ever before, their resumes dotted with stops in cities like
Calgary, and paychecks earned from places like the Arena League.
Huard played his college football at the University of Washington,
last started a game in 1998 for the Frankfurt Galaxy of NFL Europe
and Sunday before 60,006 at Foxboro Stadium drove a stake through
the hearts of the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins trailed by eight points with just over nine minutes
remaining, but Huard led them on a thrilling comeback. One drive
ended with a a field goal, the last of six for the game by Miami's
Orlando Mare. Then Huard directed a 14-play, 59-yard drive in which
he was blitzed practically every down. No matter. His winning pass
went to Stanley Pritchett from 5 yards out with 23 seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second straight week Miami had won on the road with a
late comeback, after rallying last week behind Marino against the
Colts. Miami won because of Huard's cool demeanor, Mare's six field
goals, and the Dolphins secondary holding Pro Bowl receiver Terry
Glenn to a startling zero catches.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time Damon has played in a real NFL game,''
said Miami coach Jimmy Johnson. ``We believe in him. He's going to
be a great quarterback in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan is our quarterback,'' Johnson said. ``So I don't want any
controversy here. But if he's not 100 percent, we have Damon.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino, who does not get along with Johnson to begin with, may
be on a shorter leash than ever before now that Huard has
demonstrated he has ability.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Marino's ailing shoulder his passes were so slow and
soft that linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer, about as fast as a bull on
ice skates, stepped in front of one of them and took it 57 yards
for the touchdown. Like that, the Patriots were on top. Wham, bam,
thank you Dan.
</P>
<P>
   It had been two years since Marino left a game because of
injury. Huard at first did not fare better. One of his passes, also
in the first quarter, was intercepted by outstanding cornerback Ty
Law, who returned it 27 yards for the touchdown. The Patriots were
ahead 14-0 before the wind could ruffle one hair on Johnson's head.
</P>
<P>
   Miami stayed in the game because of Mare, whose 53-yard field
goal made the score 30-25 with 2 minutes and 45 seconds left. After
a Terry Allen run for one yard and two incomplete passes by Drew
Bledsoe (17 of 36 for 225 yards, one touchdown and one
interception), Huard took over, and calmly moved Miami down the
field with mostly short, controlled passes.
</P>
<P>
   When the Dolphins reached the 5-yard line fullback Stanley
Pritchett delayed going into his passing route, then bolted to an
open spot near the goal line. Huard laid the ball out and it was an
easy touchdown (the two-point conversion was an incomplete pass to
Oronde Gadsden). Having 2:10 to score and one timeout may have
seemed easy for Miami, since during practice Johnson has the team
run two-minute drills with only 1:40 and no timeouts.
</P>
<P>
   The entire game, on the sideline, Marino coached Huard, who
threw for 240 yards, keeping him calm and helping him with his
reads during timeouts. ``Danny was absolutely first class,'' said
Huard. ``He was there all day for me even when I was making
mistakes. He was telling me to hang in there and that we'd be in it
in the fourth quarter and not to give up.''
</P>
<P>
   Huard's comeback was made even more remarkable considering what
he and his teammates overcame. First, there was the hostile crowd,
one of the more nasty in the league. Second, there were those two
Patriots defensive touchdowns. And third, New England had a
dizzying nine sacks, the most a Miami team has ever given up, one
shy of a New England team record, and the most for the Patriots
since 1979. Those are the kinds of odds Marino usually beats. Not a
guy named Huard.

   MBABANE, Swaziland _ When this tiny kingdom's only independent
newspaper discovered that the king's newest bride-to-be had dropped
out of high school _ not once, but twice _ before being picked to
be the young monarch's eighth wife, the paper's Sunday editor,
Bheki Makhubu, figured he had a sure-fire front-page story.
</P>
<P>
   But when the country's chief prosecutor read the article in The
Times of Swaziland, he concluded it was something else altogether:
a crime.
</P>
<P>
   The police and prosecutor began preparing a case against
Makhubu, and two weeks later the 29-year-old editor was arrested,
jailed overnight and charged with criminal defamation.
</P>
<P>
   When he goes on trial, Makhubu, who faces up to six years in
prison, will be battling not only the prosecutor but also a
conservative culture that reveres its traditions and scorns any
criticism of them.
</P>
<P>
   Press freedom advocates in Europe and Africa have rallied around
Makhubu, but he has little support at home. The Times has fired
him, the country's press advocacy group has criticized him and
ordinary people here express disgust that he criticized the royal
court.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``How can somebody malign a girl of 18 years to this extent?''
the director of public prosecutions, Lincoln Ng'arua, said,
referring to the king's fiancee and the questions the article
raised. ``It is completely contrary to the morals of the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truth is not the issue in the case,'' the prosecutor said,
echoing the views of many here. ``You can say something truthful
about someone and still be charged with defamation.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Criminal prosecutions of this region's journalists have become
more and more frequent in recent months as some governments try to
stifle the work of reporters who air critical views, according to
the Media Institute of Southern Africa, a press advocacy
organization based in Namibia.
</P>
<P>
   A journalist from Angola who has been critical of the government
has been arrested four times since April. Earlier this year, two
journalists from Zimbabwe were arrested after they reported that
soldiers were planning to overthrow the government. Two journalists
from Malawi who quoted protesters at an opposition rally were
charged with trying to incite a coup, and a dozen journalists at a
Zambian paper were charged with treason after publishing a report
on the country's military capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The clash between news media freedom and the deeply held
traditional reverence for Swaziland's monarchs began in early
September at the annual Reed Dance, where King Mswati III, 31, has
often selected a new bride from among the many bare-breasted
maidens who dance before him.
</P>
<P>
   The king, on the throne since 1986, is following the tradition
of his father, King Sobhuza II, who reigned for almost 61 years,
overseeing the transition from British colonial rule to
independence in 1968, and is believed to have had as many as 100
wives. This year, the king selected Senteni Masango, 18, as his
latest liphovela, or fiancee. A short story about the selection ran
in The Times.
</P>
<P>
   But a few reporters who had learned a little more about the
liphovela went to burly, chain-smoking Makhubu with their scoop,
guessing he was one of the few editors willing to publish it.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Sept. 12, the front-page screamed, ``Liphovela a high
school dropout.'' The story ran without the reporters' names and
under the byline ``Sunday Writers.'' Makhubu pledged he would take
any heat.
</P>
<P>
   The police quickly came calling, questioning reporters and
editors. But Makhubu was undeterred. Days later, when a photo of
Ms. Masango seated alongside one of the king's wives and another of
his liphovelas came across the editor's desk, he followed his
instinct. The wife was wearing a cap and gown from her own college
graduation, and the irony was irresistible. ``The graduate, the
liphovela and the dropout,'' read the front-page headline under the
photo in the Sept. 19 paper.
</P>
<P>
   This time, court elders summoned the newspaper's executives to
the royal compound. The newspaper suspended Makhubu, saying he had
disobeyed a direct order not to publish anything ``derogatory or
controversial'' about ``the king, his wives and in particular his
new liphovela.'' On Oct. 4, he was fired.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Loffler, the publisher, said in an interview that the paper
stood by the first story, and is planning to pay Makhubu's legal
expenses. He denied any pressure to fire the editor, whom he called
``a very good journalist'' whose judgment sometimes erred, but said
the second swipe at the liphovela was intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   In the streets, most people are unsympathetic to Makhubu. ``I
don't care what they do to him,'' said Theodorah Dlamini, a
43-year-old schoolteacher, whose sentiment was typical. ``It was
totally wrong. You accept what your father has decided, and the
king is our father.''
</P>
<P>
   Themba Nhlengethwa, 46, said, ``They were warned that there are
things they shouldn't touch. Even if they were right, they are
wrong.''
</P>

<P>
   In Africa, freedom frequently clashes with deeply rooted
cultural traditions. This is especially so in smaller countries
like Swaziland, with just under 1 million people who share the same
heritage, said Jeanette Minnie, regional director of the Media
Institute of Southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Swaziland's authorities had usually used more subtle
tactics, like summoning reporters and editors for chats with the
elders, rather than turning to the colonial-era defamation laws,
Ms. Minnie said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Makhubu's passport has been revoked. He may end up in
prison. And he has lost his job, with scant chances of working here
as a journalist again.

IN NEW YORK, IT'S SPANISH EVERYWHERE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By MIRTA OJITO    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sitting on their mother's laps, six small children
wait quietly in a second-floor school room on Manhattan's Upper
East Side. The oldest child is 2; the youngest just turned 1. One
sucks his thumb. Another plays with her belly button.
</P>
<P>
   ``Si, quien esta aqui?'' asks teacher Veronica Noguera, a furry
puppet on each hand. ``Buenos dias, ninos. Buenos dias.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Noguera's students start talking, their first language
will be English. But their parents, who don't speak Spanish, have
sent their children here to learn what they are sure is becoming an
essential skill in this increasingly bilingual city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want my child to lag behind,'' said Linda Hughes, who
commutes an hour each way to take her son, Lucas, 3, to Spanish
lessons once a week. ``This city is so bilingual already, you can
no longer ignore Spanish.''
</P>
<P>
   Latinos have been woven indelibly into the city's fabric for
generations _ Puerto Ricans began arriving in the 1930s, followed
by Dominicans, Cubans and, lately, Mexicans. Today, half the
Bronx's residents are Hispanic; one of five New Yorkers speaks
Spanish at home. In the last 10 years, the city's Hispanic presence
has grown by 400,000 _ the population of Atlanta. At 2.2 million,
Hispanic New Yorkers outnumber every other minority group.
</P>
<P>
   Once, Hispanic immigrants tended to live and work in enclaves
like Washington Heights, the Lower East Side, the Bronx and parts
of Queens _ but today's they are moving far beyond.
</P>
<P>
   And non-Hispanic New Yorkers are responding to the trend in
practical ways. They are signing up for Spanish lessons _ at home,
at work and in schools. In the last two years, Spanish has become
the most requested language in the city's private language schools,
where registration has doubled, forcing many schools to add classes
or find bigger buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, speaking Spanish is beginning to pay. Workers in
businesses like the St. Regis Hotel, Metropolitan Hospital Center
and a various news organizations have signed up for Spanish classes
financed by employers. The city police department will soon begin
offering language programs. Churches and schools, often unable to
fill positions that demand Spanish proficiency, bring in priests
and teachers from Spain and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Richler, a former judicial referee on Manhattan's Family
Court, realized about three years ago that about a third of the
people in her courtroom primarily spoke Spanish. Although
interpreters were always available, Ms. Richler decided she had to
be able to match the words to the facial expressions of the people
whose fates depended on her rulings.
</P>
<P>
   She signed up for night classes and joined an evening Spanish
conversation group. Now, Ms. Richler can understand intricate cases
and dispense legal advice in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``In court, I know what the clients are saying the moment they
say it, and they know that I know,'' said Ms. Richler, 60.
</P>
<P>
   Anastasio Sanchez, language program director at the Cervantes
Institute, said that in the last two years the number of students
at his school had almost doubled. Last year, 1,440 students
registered for classes; the year before, 850. Now, classes are
taught in offices and rooms not previously used as classrooms. The
school recently bought a bigger building.
</P>
<P>
   At the Spanish Institute, about 1,700 students registered for
classes last year, double the number two years before, said Ana
Menendez, language program director.
</P>
<P>
   The number of students taking Spanish in the city's Berlitz
language schools has grown by 37 percent. Last year, Spanish
surpassed English as the most popular language at one of two
Manhattan Berlitz centers. More than half the students in that
center, on Rector Street, said they needed it for work or to move
to another job, said Dawn Liles, marketing associate.
</P>
<P>
   In city schools, Hispanic children make up almost 40 percent of
the student body. Many are bilingual or know only Spanish. Their
growing presence has forced administrators to hire qualified
bilingual teachers. Last year, 35 teachers from Puerto Rico and
seven from Spain were hired. This year, 40 came from Puerto Rico
and six from Spain, administrators said.
</P>
<P>
   In Roman Catholic churches, where Spanish Masses were once rare,
about half of churchgoers are now Hispanic immigrants. The
archdiocese has taught Spanish to its priests for decades in its
own school. But in the last five years, it has had to bring in 150
priests and 80 nuns from Latin America and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had priests who suddenly realized one day that they were
preaching to a group of people who did not understand the
sermons,'' said Martin Poblete, archdiocese adviser on Hispanic
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses and cultural institutions have also taken note of the
changes. The 92nd Street Y offers health classes and literary
events in Spanish. In stores like Harry's Shoes on the Upper West
Side and the Gap at Madison Avenue, some clerks greet clients in
Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the top 500 companies to smaller businesses, there is a
sense that the Latino population is growing,'' said Justin Blake, a
New York City Partnership and Chamber of Commerce spokesman. ``The
private sector is waking up.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 10 percent of the companies that call Blake looking
for qualified employees say they want people who speak Spanish, he
said. But Spanish is so prevalent here that companies can usually
find Spanish-speaking employees, he said. Companies and agencies
based outside Manhattan tend not to seek Spanish lessons because
they are able to find speakers in their own neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, though, language training has become necessary,
especially for people in the services, government and even
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at Metropolitan Hospital Center in East Harlem started
taking Spanish at work almost two years ago, after officials there
learned that about 65 percent of their patients would prefer to
speak Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Among the doctors taking classes was George Bousvaros, 69, a
cardiologist. He wanted to be able to ask the type of questions
that cardiologists everywhere routinely ask. He has already learned
the word he needs more than any other: ``corazon,'' or heart.

PROPOSAL TO REOPEN REACTOR STIRS SAFETY CONCERNS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Wash.)   (jw) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Supervisors at a government nuclear fuel factory
near Richland, Wash., sometimes told workers to ignore rules
designed to prevent accidental nuclear reactions, according to an
Energy Department investigation that has gained new interest
because of a recent accident in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The factory, the Plutonium Finishing Plant at the department's
Hanford Nuclear Reservation, stopped production 10 years ago
because the United States no longer needed new plutonium for
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But the Energy Department is considering reopening a nearby test
reactor, mainly used for research and for production of isotopes
that can be used for electric power in space ships. Restarting the
reactor, known as the Fast Flux Test Facility, could revive the use
of the finishing plant to process plutonium, which is a product of
the reactor as well as its fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the reactor say the fuel it requires and its
history of rules violations are similar to those that led to a
nuclear accident last month in Tokaimura, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In that accident, three workers received large doses of
radiation and dozens more were exposed at lower levels when workers
broke plant rules and put too much uranium in a container, allowing
a chain reaction to begin. The industry calls this an uncontrolled
``criticality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All the elements for a Tokaimura nuclear criticality disaster
exist at Hanford,'' said Gerry Pollet, executive director of Heart
of America Northwest. That group and another organization that is
trying to stop the reopening of the reactor, the government
Accountability Project, obtained documents about the investigation
and released them on the eve of a hearing into the reactor.
</P>
<P>
   The two groups say the fuels used at the reactor resemble those
at Tokaimura, enriched with a much higher percentage of the kind of
atoms that can sustain a chain reaction.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Fast Flux Test Facility may use a highly enriched
fuel, that fuel is solid and thus is not vulnerable to the kind of
accident that happened in Japan, Ernest Moniz, the undersecretary
of energy, said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Moniz said that six years of fuel was in hand at Hanford and
that Germany, which is moving away from using plutonium, had
offered enough for another 14 years. The Plutonium Finishing
Plant's involvement would be minimal, he said. And while Moniz
acknowledged that ``there clearly were some procedural breakdowns,
involving workers and supervisors,'' he said the agency had been
correcting those problems.
</P>
<P>
   According to a short history assembled by Robert Alvarez, a
former senior Energy Department official, there have been nine
criticality accidents in the United States since 1945, eight of
them in the government's system for making nuclear weapons,
including one at Hanford, in 1962. In the accidents, four people
died within days of exposure.
</P>
<P>
   The Plutonium Finishing Plant has not had any accidents of this
kind, but it was shut down for long periods in 1996 and 1997 after
17 violations of rules meant to avoid criticalities. The violations
took place as technicians tried intermittently to stabilize liquid
plutonium left over from weapons production.
</P>
<P>
   A government investigation in November 1997 found that ``in
several instances, supervisors directed the workers to ignore the
procedures or postings and perform the work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Although no adverse consequences occurred,'' the report said,
``the increased chance of creating an unsafe condition due to
noncompliance with criticality safety procedures is a significant
safety concern.''
</P>
<P>
   The rules violations included moving plutonium without knowing
how much other plutonium was nearby, raising the possibility that a
critical mass would be brought together, creating a lethal shower
of radiation.
</P>
<P>
   The Fast Flux Test Facility was shut in 1992 after running for
about a decade. Although the Energy Department has not yet decided
to reopen it, the agency is to begin hearings in Seattle on Monday
as part of an environmental review of the idea.

COUP LEADER RESTRUCTURES PAKISTAN'S GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TIM WEINER and STEVE LeVINE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ Pakistan's military ruler, saying his
nation had ``hit rock bottom,'' redrew its government Sunday night,
creating a military and civilian council to run the country and
giving no timetable for relinquishing the absolute power he seized
five days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Pulling back from a confrontation that some feared could lead to
nuclear war, Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf said he would unilaterally
withdraw troops from India's border and pursue peace talks. He said
he would restrain nuclear weapons tests, although he did not
promise to refrain from them.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on national television for only the second time since
the armed forces seized power in a bloodless coup late Tuesday, the
general said he would ruthlessly pursue politicians and power
brokers ``guilty of plundering and looting the national wealth.''
And, in a rebuke to extremist Islamic parties, he warned clerics
not to stoke fundamentalist fevers for political gain.
</P>
<P>
   It was a passionate speech delivered dispassionately by an
expressionless soldier in full-dress uniform. Musharraf, 58, was a
near stranger to most of his countrymen until last week. But his
address, given first in English, then in Urdu, promised
``revolutionary steps'' to revive a near-moribund economy and
radical means to achieve them. If he succeeds, he may go down as a
hero in the history of a nation weary of politicians and promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty-two years ago, we started with a beacon of hope, and
today that beacon is no more,'' the general said. ``We stand in
darkness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our economy has crumbled, our credibility is lost, state
institutions lie demolished,'' he said. ``People who once were
brothers are now at each others' throats.'' Pakistan, he said, had
``a label of democracy, not the essence of it. Our people were
never emancipated from the yoke of despotism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shall not allow the people to be taken back to the era of
sham democracy, but to a true one. And I promise you I will, if God
wills it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even his supporters acknowledge that what Musharraf and the army
have done since Tuesday night _ overthrown the prime minister,
Nawaz Sharif, abolished Parliament, suspended the constitution and
re-created a government by fiat _ is illegal, unconstitutional and
essentially high treason.
</P>
<P>
   And some of those same supporters say there is no telling when
Musharraf might give up power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took Gen. Zia eight years to get out of this dilemma,''
said Ijaz ul-Haq, referring to his father, Gen. Mohammad Zia
ul-Haq, Pakistan's last military dictator. Zia seized power in
1977, ruled under martial law until 1985 and died in a plane crash
while still in office in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf said Sunday night that Pakistan was on the verge of
disintegration, and that he had risked the constitution to save the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not martial law, only another path to democracy,'' he
said. He said he would blaze that trail by replacing Parliament
with a six-member National Security Council. He said that the
council would include the chiefs of the navy and air force, and
four yet unnamed experts in law, finance, foreign policy and
national affairs, supported by a think tank of advisers. Under the
council would be a cabinet of ministers, also unnamed.
</P>
<P>
   The only remaining link to the old order will be President Rafik
Tarar, who held little power under the constitutional framework and
was a staunch ally of the ousted prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   To revive Pakistan's crumbling economy _ a mammoth task, given
the nation's near-insolvency and the way in which politicians and
their cronies use the treasury as their personal bank _ the general
said he would try to recover ``the looted national wealth _ a task
that will be ruthlessly pursued.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent history of nations like the Philippines and the
former Zaire, now Congo, where rulers stole billions and
impoverished their people, suggests that this will be a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the money has already been siphoned off'' to overseas
accounts, said ul-Haq, the deputy leader of the Muslim League, the
party of Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf said that, in addition to prosecuting corrupt
politicians, he will force the wealthy to pay their taxes, which
will be a new experience for most, and will compel businessmen to
repay $4 billion in government loans that are overdue or in
default.
</P>
<P>
   He gave them an ultimatum: Pay up in a month, or go to jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``My advice to the guilty is to return voluntarily national
wealth and bank loans and pay their taxes before the hand of law
forces them to do so,'' the general said. And he promised to make
his own assets and tax returns open to public scrutiny, an
unheard-of gesture in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   He offered an unexpected olive branch to India, four months
after leading troops in skirmishes against the Indian army in the
disputed territory of Kashmir. Sharif withdrew from the
confrontation in July at the urging of President Clinton, which
raised tensions between the Pakistani leader and his army to a
breaking point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pakistan would welcome unconditional, equitable and
result-oriented dialogue with India,'' Musharraf said, and he
announced ``a unilateral military de-escalation,'' including ``the
return of all our forces moved to the borders in the recent past.''
About 30,000 Pakistani soldiers are stationed at the border with
India, in a tense standoff that has raised fears of the fourth war
between the nations since 1947.
</P>
<P>
   But Musharraf did not say that troops would be withdrawn from
the Kashmir area, where the border is disputed, and he pledged
support for ``our Kashmiri brethren.''
</P>
<P>
   (India reacted cautiously to the announcement, Reuters reported
from New Delhi. India's national security adviser, Brajesh Mishra,
asked whether he was satisfied, told the Star News television
channel: ``I am not going to say I am not satisfied,'' adding:
``But we will look at what he has said.'')
</P>
<P>
   Military men, politicians and political analysts said it
appeared that Musharraf, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff,
planned to stay in power at least until the next scheduled election
in February 2002, and perhaps much longer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The former army chief, the retired Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg, who had
the opportunity to declare martial law when Zia died but held
elections instead, said Musharraf was right to seize power in the
way he did, but wrong not to say how long he would hold it or the
way he would wield it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wants to clean up the mess, he should have a very
undoubtful start,'' Beg said in an interview. ``He hasn't given a
good idea of the type of government he wants to form.''
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to gauge the reaction from the great mass of
Pakistanis Sunday night; most of the nation's 138 million people
are poor, with little real power, and no real voice in the nation's
politics.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Criticism came from Qazi Hussein Ahmed, the leader of
Jamaat-i-Islami, the nation's largest Islamic political party, who
said he was ``disappointed that the general did not expose the
names of those who looted the nation's wealth and did not offer any
electoral reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   But across the political spectrum of Pakistan's elite, the
people most likely to be hit in the pocketbook by the general's
proposed reforms, reactions ranged from cautious approval to
pleasant surprise to pure elation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never heard such a powerful, straightforward and honest
speech,'' said Sadruddin Hashwani, who owns some of Pakistan's
biggest hotels and an oil company. ``It is a turning point, a
chance to make a good country of Pakistan.''
</P>
<P>
   Ul-Haq, a potential future prime minister and the probable new
leader of the nation's most powerful political party, said: ``I am
both happy and sorry. Sorry because the speech should have been
given by someone with the mandate of the people _ that is, Nawaz
Sharif. Instead it has been given by an army general.''
</P>
<P>
   Javed AminKwhara, a landowner and farmer in Lahore, said he
worried that ``there was no mention of a time frame or a way to go
to the people with a referendum or something that would give people
more confidence. But there seems to be a consensus in the country
that you need a new political system.
</P>
<P>
   Najam Sethi, an outspoken newspaper editor, said: ``The general
has pulled these words from the agenda of the liberal
intellectuals. Most people will say, `What you say is right. Now
let's see what you do.''' But, he cautioned: ``This is not an
interim agenda. This is a two- to five-year agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehriyar Pataudi, senior vice president of Askari Commercial
Bank, called the peace offering to India ``the most intelligent
move I've ever seen a leader make in this country.'' He predicted
that the general's laying bare his personal finances would ``set an
example that might produce a different flock of politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf closed his speech with a prayer that he said he had
composed. He asked for ``the vision to see and perceive the true
from the false, the wisdom to comprehend the problem and find its
solution, the courage to do justice and the strength to do right.''

HE'S OLDER, WISER _ AND HE'S READY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He offered no pretense, didn't even feign hiding
his excitement. When A.C. Green was introduced prior to the Los
Angeles Lakers' first public scrimmage, he unexpectedly sprinted
around the UC Santa Barbara gym, beaming while high-fiving the
public.
</P>
<P>
   So what can be expected when Green makes his official homecoming
appearance with the Lakers in their Staples Center opener?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, something very different.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be time for work,'' Green said. ``I can be pumped up
and excited and all that, but I get all that in and out of me in
the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes down to the regular season, my game face kind of
comes back on, and my game mentality. I get down to business and
I'm more focused. Of course, there's still going to be excitement,
but I don't think anyone is going to be able to notice.''
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, however, Green is excited to be back where he
began his NBA career _ and a record 1,028 consecutive-games streak
_ as a rookie out of Oregon State in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Despite spending the past five seasons with Phoenix and Dallas,
Green continued to live in Los Angeles during the offseason. And at
age 36, he returns in a much different role. He's not the wide-eyed
rookie joining a championship team but the veteran trying to help
show a young team how to be a champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good being at home, sleeping in my own bed, going to my
home church,'' he said. ``Most of my friends in my adult life have
pretty much been here. Those things are always good. It's part of a
complete circle from a career standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's a good team, a team you feel has a lot of potential
but has a lot of bad habits, too. You have to try and help them
overcome those bad habits. It's not like I don't make the same
mistakes or have some of the same tendencies, but they have to
correct me and I have to correct them. We have to learn about
accountability and responsibility toward one another.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-9 Green could emerge as the Lakers starting power
forward. Though his numbers have been in decline over the past
three seasons _ he averaged a career-low 4.9 points and 4.6
rebounds per game last season for the Mavericks _ he continues to
give full effort on a team in need of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A.C. is as steady a person as I've ever met, in terms of his
effort and quality,'' said Lakers assistant coach Jim Cleamons.
``He's going to give you everything he has in his tank and you're
going to be happy with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Green played for Cleamons in Dallas, where he initially ran the
triangle, so he already has some experience with the Lakers' new
offense.
</P>
<P>
   He returns to Los Angeles claiming to be close to the player who
left. He had the same scores onthe team's exhibiton-season
quickness tests as he did as a rookie. &QL;

   LAUSD-BELMONT (Los Angeles) _ The scandalous Belmont Learning
Center _ the nation's most expensive public high school _ has
racked up at least $33.5 million in bills above the costs
previously disclosed by Los Angeles Unified officials. The hidden
encumbered costs bring the ``official'' cost of the Belmont project
to $159 million, about twice the district's original ``guaranteed
maximum price.'' By Beth Barrett and Greg Gittrich.
</P>
<P>
   LAUSD-ANGEL (Los Angeles) _ The Los Angeles Unified School
District could be saved by an angel. Nearly three months ago, the
district received a confidential proposal from the developer of a
curious angelic monument to buy the tainted Belmont Learning Center
property. The school board dismissed the idea in private without
taking a vote and has not notified an advisory commission weighing
the fate of the public works fiasco. But the developer says the
offer still stands. By Greg Gittrich.

   CHASENS (Los Angeles) _ Chasen's restaurant, where Ronald Reagan
proposed to his second wife and Jimmy Stewart held his bachelor
party, served up one last helping of Hollywood lore Sunday. The
famed gathering place for the movie industry's mightiest, which
closed in 1995, auctioned its restaurant equipment and nearly 60

Frank Sinatra and Clark Gable, a telegram from Howard Hughes and a

<P>
   TOBACCO (Los Angeles) _ In a bold move to stem the sale of
tobacco to minors, Los Angeles is considering issuing revocable
licenses to all stores, supermarkets and gas stations that sell
cigarettes or cigars. The City Council has approved spending some
of the $1.5 million from settlements with the tobacco industry to
enforce the licensing program, and the City Attorney's Office is
drafting the law. By Dominic Berbeo.

<P>
   ALCOHOL (Los Angeles) _ Billboards for beer, wine and liquor
would be banned from most of Los Angeles, unless alcohol industry
attorneys win a hearing in court Monday. The attorneys contend the
law, which takes effect Oct. 23, infringes on their First
Ammendment rights to free commercial speech. The city, along with a
grassroots coalition of community organizations, argue the
advertisements have increasingly been aimed at minors, who cannot
legally purchase liquor. By Dominic Berbeo.

ON BASEBALL: VALENTIN CAME FROM OUT OF NOWHERE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The animated conversations about John Valentin took
place in the ancient newspaper offices of The Jersey Journal in
Jersey City 14 years ago. Every night, Larry Babich would shuffle
30 feet from the newsroom to the sports department and ask Mike
Hogan about Valentin's future. Hogan barely looked up from his
typewriter before telling Babich nothing had changed.
</P>
<P>
   Babich, a rewrite man for The Journal, was also coaching Jersey
City State College in 1985, and he thought that Valentin would be a
decent shortstop for that Division III school. Valentin had been a
solid high school player at St. Anthony, so a small college was a
logical place for him.
</P>
<P>
   But Valentin had another plan. Hogan, a sportswriter who coached
Valentin in high school, repeatedly told Babich that Valentin was
going to attend Seton Hall, the premier Division I university in
New Jersey, and try out as a walk-on. It was a gutsy decision by a
player who was barely recruited by anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll get lost at Seton Hall,'' Babich would bark to Hogan.
``If he comes here, he'll play.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogan listened to the same recruiting pitch while his two
fingers pecked away at the keys. Finally, Hogan would stop typing,
look up and say again, ``The kid wants to go to Seton Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   Because I was an intern at The Journal and because I had played
a couple of games against Valentin in high school and in summer
leagues, I was intrigued by these discussions. I knew Valentin as a
slick fielder with a powerful arm whose uniform pants were baggy
because he weighed 140 pounds. Seton Hall seemed like the wrong
choice for a slap hitter who was not even the best player on his
high school team. Like everyone else, I was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen years later, Valentin leaned back on a chair inside the
Red Sox clubhouse at Fenway Park, talking about his dramatic
ascension. It was 24 hours before he crushed Roger Clemens' 96 mph
fastball for a two-run homer as Boston pounded the Yankees, 13-1,
in Game 3 of the American League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   But Valentin, who has had a remarkable postseason with a .306
average, a team-record four home runs and 17 runs batted in, was in
a time capsule as he recalled choosing Seton Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in destiny,'' Valentin said. ``I believe that things
are going to happen if they're supposed to happen. I believe you'll
win if you're supposed to win and you'll lose if you're supposed to
lose. That's the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentin went to Seton Hall but did not attend the first
practice because he was nervous about combining baseball with
classes. By the next day, the freshman relaxed and asked for a
tryout. Fifty other wannabes had the same brilliant idea.
</P>
<P>
   This is where Valentin's rise from an unknown walk-on to the
reliable and resilient third baseman for the Red Sox includes more
karma. If Valentin had not made the team, he would have stayed at
Seton Hall with his brother, Arnold, and, at 18, concluded his
baseball career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess,'' Valentin said, ``that would have been it.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, it is commonplace to watch the ALCS and ignore how
Valentin reached this elite level. If a player is talented enough
to make it to the major leagues, it is assumed that he has always
been great. Valentin was always solid. Greatness came later. Maybe
it was destined. One of Seton Hall's coaches scouted Valentin and
politely told Hogan that he was crisp defensively, but that Seton
Hall was not interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know that until later,'' Valentin said.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan had never discouraged Valentin and never told him the
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you should tell a kid they can't do something,''
Hogan said. ``If you do, they'll always wonder if they could
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentin played one ``B'' game, immediately proved he was the
best fielder on campus and hurdled two incumbents to start at
shortstop. He lifted weights for the first time and bulked up to
185 pounds; he played on teams with Craig Biggio and Mo Vaughn, and
he was drafted by the Red Sox in 1988. Valentin is a .283 hitter in
seven-plus seasons, a good-quality professional player. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several reporters had finished asking Valentin about Pedro
Martinez and Clemens, so Valentin's voice was a bit giddier as he
talked about growing up on 16th Street in downtown Jersey City.
Valentin whacked baseballs on a concrete slab so nondescript it did
not have a name. It was just called the playground.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin smiled now, explaining how he is a pull hitter because
he never hit the opposite way for fear of breaking windows beyond
the playground. When I mentioned a tremendous player we both knew
who fizzled out, Valentin conceded he was fortunate to still be
playing baseball and confident about helping the Red Sox get to a
World Series for the first time since 1918. Valentin never expected
this. No one did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some kids I grew up with had great talent and they all went in
different directions,'' Valentin said. ``They went to the beach,
they chased girls. I didn't do that. All I wanted to do was play
baseball. Why? I don't know. I just did.''

HOCKEY'S NET EFFECT GOES TO EXTREMES

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; The goal of Buffalo Sabres fan Jeffrey Spring is that no one
forgets the goal that ended last season's Stanley Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   With a Web site and resisting an NHL cease-and-desist letter,
Spring has sprung into action.
</P>
<P>
   The league office was upset that the site (www.nogoal.com) had
photos of the controversial goal that Dallas' Brett Hull, with his
skate in the crease, put past Buffalo's Dominik Hasek in
double-overtime last June.
</P>
<P>
   After consulting a lawyer, Spring took the pictures down, even
though he reasons they were shown all over the world. He does,
however, continue to sell shirts and caps with the site's logo _ a
Cup with the red circle and slash through it _ and present his
manifesto as to why this injustice should be thrown in the league's
face at every opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   __ Taking to another level the idea that hockey is a religion,
there's a Kentucky-based site (www.hockeyrosary.com) that, as the
URL implies, offers a unique puck-prayer bead string.
</P>
<P>
   For those moments of despair, the Cusick Creations' trinket
(selling for $20) uses the standard Catholic rosary-bead idea,
leading down to a miniature Stanley Cup charm. And it's available
in all team colors.
</P>
<P>
   __ NFL bylaws limit the ownership group of a team to 25 _ this
came after the Green Bay Packers' stock-option plan _ but that
restriction might be challenged by a group of New York Jets fans
who have been trying to rally support at a site
(www.buythejets.com) to have a bunch of people ante up just a
little and purchase the franchise that's currently seeking
ownership.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL could open itself to antitrust violations if it refuses
the eventual bid. It's worth keeping an eye on how this progresses.
</P>
<P>
   __ Sony Online Entertainment has launched a game called ``Sports
Jeopardy!'' on its site (www.station.sony.com) as well as a special
set-up site (www.sportsjeopardy.com).
</P>
<P>
   __ The new University of North Carolina basketball uniforms,
which were designed by Michael Jordan's new company called Jordan
Brand, have been previewed on the school's Web site
(www.goheels.com). According to the Charlotte Observer, the local
response has been overwhelming distain toward the design.
</P>
<P>
   __ Next year, another pro spring-football league wants to get
six to 10 teams to play a 12-week schedule that has a championship
game played on Memorial Day. For an update on its progress, it has
a site (www.springfootball.com). &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As the year 2000 approaches, here's a look at some
of the interesting anniversaries that will occur this week in Los
Angeles sports history:
</P>
<P>
   __ Oct. 19, 1981: Rick Monday's ninth-inning home run lifts the
Dodgers past the Montreal Expos 2-1 in the decisive game of the
National League Championship Series on a cold, rainy night in
Montreal. Fernando Valenzuela combines with Bob Welch on a
three-hitter to win it.
</P>
<P>
   __ Oct. 19, 1960: In the first game representing Los Angeles,
the Lakers lose in Cincinnati 140-123.
</P>
<P>
   __ Oct. 20, 1988: In Oakland, Orel Hershiser limits the
Athletics to four singles and wins Game 5 of the World Series 5-1
to give the Dodgers an improbable championship. Hershiser, who also
won Game 1, is the Series MVP. He later goes on the ``Tonight
Show'' and sings the religious hymns that he had been humming to
himself between innings.
</P>
<P>
   __ Oct. 21, 1973: The Rams' Fred Dryer is the first in NFL
history to record two safeties in one game during the team's 24-7
win over Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   __ Oct. 22, 1950: The Rams set an NFL regular-season record with
a 70-27 win over the Baltimore Colts.
</P>
<P>
   __ Oct. 24, 1984: The Kings trade Charlie Simmer to Boston,
breaking up the ``Triple Crown'' line that included Marcel Dionne
and Dave Taylor. The three had skated together since Jan. 1979.
</P>
<P>
   __ Birthdays: Wednesday: Former Dodgers outfielder and current
broadcaster Rick Monday (54). Thursday: Former Dodgers shortstop
and manager Bill Russell (51). Friday: Former Kings star Butch
Goring (50) and former UCLA football coach Dick Vermeil (63). &QL;

CLIPPERS EXHIBIT SIGNS OF LIFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The NBA won't be playing with live ammo for
another 16 days, but the Los Angeles Clippers aren't about to
apologize for what amounts to a pair of ``paint-ball'' victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for these guys to think they can win while
staying within the system,'' said Coach Chris Ford in reference to
weekend exhibition triumphs in Toronto and Chicago. ``But we still
have a ways to go. We certainly can't feel smug.''
</P>
<P>
   No, but the Clippers also won't be feeling typically unarmed
when the regular season begins.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie swingman Lamar Odom provided evidence that he may be the
truth during a 25-point, 8-rebound effort vs. the Raptors on
Friday. Guard Derek Anderson, acquired in the deal that turned
Lamond Murray loose on Cleveland, added 20 in that game, then
pitched in 19 at Chicago on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's providing the kind of play I hoped that I was getting,''
Ford said of Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Another virtual newcomer supplying big numbers is backup
center/forward Brian Skinner, who spent last season as a somewhat
dazed-and-confused rookie on the end of the Clipper bench.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Bulls, the 6-foot-9, 250-pound Skinner scored 13
points, tracked down 11 rebounds and blocked 7 shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an absolute monster last night,'' Ford said. ``It was
something to see.''
</P>
<P>
   But his production is not all that surprising to those who saw
Skinner at almost every voluntary off-season workout the Clippers
sanctioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really worked in the off-season,'' Ford said. ``And he's
grown tremendously in his knowledge of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Fast breaks: Point guard Eric Murdock, whose injured ankle
has kept him in street clothes for the three exhibition games,
participated in Sunday's light workout in Carson. Ford said today's
workout would determine Murdock's status for Tuesday's exhibition
game at Phoenix. ... A sore knee cut Maurice Taylor's minutes
Friday in Toronto, but whistles kept him on the bench for much of
Saturday's game. ``He was going to play his normal minutes
Saturday,'' Ford said, ``but he got into foul trouble.'' Foul
trouble reached epidemic proportion in Chicago. ``They were just
silly touch fouls,'' the coach said.

 &HT;    Irene brings more rain, worries to eastern N.C.
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, N.C. _ Hurricane Irene drenched eastern North
Carolina with torrential rains Sunday, threatening more flooding in
a region still reeling from historic floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
   The storm had dumped more than 6 inches of rain late Sunday on
eastern North Carolina, and forecasters predicted that the Cape
Fear, Neuse and Tar rivers would crest again. The Cape Fear, in
particular, was expected to crest 20 feet above flood stage later
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Irene initially was expected to come ashore near the South
Carolina line Sunday night, but then it picked up speed and tacked
to the northeast, a path that may guide it along the coast. By
nightfall, it was 115 miles south-southwest of Wilmington, moving
northeast at 14 mph.
</P>
<P>
   A hurricane warning was posted from north of Edisto Beach, S.C.,
to Cape Hatteras. A tropical storm warning was in effect north of
Cape Hatteras to Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   No deaths had been reported in association with the storm in
North Carolina by Sunday night. Irene was blamed for seven previous
deaths, five in Florida and two in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The latest drenching comes a month after North Carolina's worst
natural disaster, Hurricane Floyd, caused record flooding. Floyd
was blamed in at least 49 deaths and damage estimated at $6 billion
or more.
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks earlier, Hurricane Dennis had soaked eastern
North Carolina, leaving many areas vulnerable to the 20 inches of
rain Floyd dumped Sept. 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all storm weary, but we can't ignore this storm. It's
very dangerous and has the potential to cause lots of damage,''
said Robert Carver, spokesman for the State Emergency Response Team
in Greenville, N.C. ``The ground is saturated still because we had
a massive flooding event and the rivers are already fairly high.
We're concerned the water is going to build up again, and it's very
likely we could have additional flooding.''
</P>
<P>
   With winds of 75 mph, Irene churned up the North Carolina coast
early Sunday and forced the evacuation of several beach communities
after North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt declared a state of emergency,
the third in two months.
</P>
<P>
   State officials prepared for the hurricane by activating 300
National Guardsmen, opening 39 Guard armories and putting 10 water
rescue teams on standby in anticipating of flooding. The American
Red Cross opened 43 shelters in 21 counties.
</P>
<P>
   Officials opened three shelters in Duplin County, north of
Wilmington. By midafternoon, 60 evacuees had arrived, compared with
600 to 900 who sought refuge during recent hurricanes, said Carson
Smith, the county's emergency management coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that as winds began gusting, more people would
evacuate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a savvy bunch of people down here, based on
experience,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   In Brunswick County, emergency officials opened three shelters,
but only 80 people had arrived by 6 p.m. Cecil Logan, director of
the county's Emergency Management Agency, said he was pleased that
Irene appeared to be taking an eastward jog.
</P>
<P>
   Pitt County officials opened three additional shelters Sunday.
Officials there were also concerned that fatalities would arise
from people driving on dangerous roads or going out to survey the
damage.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency in Greenville closed its
centers Sunday and today, anticipating that the storm would make
travel conditions hazardous. The agency set up disaster recovery
centers across the state to help residents recovering from
Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   FEMA will reopen its centers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keeping people out of harm's way is always our first
priority,'' said Federal Coordinating Officer Glenn Woodard.
``Potential storm water run-offs and local flooding from Hurricane
Irene could pose a risk to people seeking assistance as well as to
recovery workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials issued a flash flood warning for a 100-mile-by-50-mile
stretch of eastern North Carolina straddling Interstate 95 between
Fayetteville and Rocky Mount. Gale-force winds were measured at the
coast, and a tornado was reported by radar over Jacksonville on
Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   By early afternoon Sunday, water was filling ditches and
covering low-lying roads, some still lined by soggy carpet,
furniture and other debris from Floyd. Eighteen miles north of
Wilmington, water lapped at the shoulder of I-40, along a stretch
flooded by Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   The National Hurricane Center in Miami said there was a chance
Irene might skirt the North Carolina coast without coming ashore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too close to call,'' said meteorologist Bill Frederick.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina clung to that hope late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears we are not going to get as much rain as had been
originally forecast,'' said Bill Clontz, with the New Hanover
County Emergency Operations Center in Wilmington. ``We think we
have come out of this in the best possible scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Irene dumped enough rain to add more misery to
flood-socked residents.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are having to evacuate temporary housing _ that's the
kind of year it's been,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the thousands of people who lost their homes during
Floyd have moved into more than 300 government-provided travel
trailers in Pender and several other counties. Other victims bought
travel trailers, moved in with relatives or friends or made other
temporary arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Then along came Irene, forcing the evacuation of the displaced,
many who had lost practically everything.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can only imagine the frustration and anxiety I have seen on
people's faces, having to move again into shelters and not knowing
what they will find when they go back,'' state public safety
secretary Richard Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing I saved was an eating table,'' said Maurice
Kelley, 27, a logger in the Duplin County community of Rivenbark
Town.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd's flooding of the Northeast Cape Fear River ruined
Kelley's mobile home, and he and his wife, Carol, bought a
37-foot-long travel camper.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley put it atop a hill to avoid future flooding. But he
didn't feel safe staying in it during Irene, so he and his family
spent the weekend at his in-laws.
</P>
<P>
   In Rocky Mount, 300 people returned to a shelter after Irene
forced them to evacuate their campers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I fear the next step we're going to make is in the ground,''
said 37-year-old Fannie Lewis. ''You can run, but you can't hide.''

SPORTS COLUMN: THIS TIME JETS LOSE MORE THAN A GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Not long after Ray Lucas arrived in the
New York Jets locker room Sunday, he was on cloud nine; he would be
a starting quarterback for the first time since he was at Rutgers
in 1995. But when he finally returned to the locker room after the
16-13 loss to the Colts, he was on crutches.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the Jets had found a quarterback, they lost him.
</P>
<P>
   Life's been like that for the Jets' quarterbacks this shattered
season. Vinny Testaverde has been on crutches ever since he tore an
Achilles tendon in the season opener. And now Lucas, sacked by
defensive tackle Ellis Johnson on the last play of the game, is on
crutches with what the Jets are describing as a sprained left
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``More X-rays will be taken Monday,'' said Dr. Elliott Hershman,
a Jets orthopedist. ``We'll know more after those X-rays.''
</P>
<P>
   Notice that the Jets were not saying if the X-rays were negative
or not, so Lucas' injury could be worse than a sprain. But things
can't get much worse for the Jets, who are 1-5 and now must turn to
the demoted Rick Mirer at quarterback with punter Tom Tupa as the
backup for next Sunday's game in Oakland and probably beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to get a little spark,'' Parcells said, alluding
to why he chose Lucas to start. ``I made the decision late Saturday
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells had considered switching quarterbacks after last Monday
night's 16-6 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars, then on Wednesday he
announced, ``Mirer starts'' against the Colts. But throughout the
week Lucas got 50 percent of the snaps in practice and Sunday he
got the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had practiced all week for Mirer,'' said Colts linebacker
Cornelius Bennett, ``but we knew about the running threat of
Lucas.''
</P>
<P>
   That running threat helped Lucas, who completed 10 of his first
14 passes for 87 yards, directing the Jets to a quick 13-0 lead
early in the second quarter. Slowly but surely, the Colts created a
13-13 tie, but in the fourth quarter five consecutive rushes by
Curtis Martin moved the Jets to a first-and-goal at the Colts'
3-yard line with less than 5 minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   On first down, Lucas looked left and threw a floater toward wide
receiver Keyshawn Johnson, but cornerback Jeff Burris intercepted
and returned it to the Jets' 45. Ten plays later, Gary Vanderjagt
kicked the winning 27-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining the choice of the pass that was intercepted
instead of having Martin run again, Parcells talked about how
``we've been stopped on short-yardage'' all season. He would not
blame Lucas, saying ``It's hard for me to see the angle; it was a
good play by them.'' But a more experienced quarterback would have
zipped that pass deeper instead of floating it.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas later told a Jets' official, ``I blew it with the
interception and life goes on.'' By then he was in the trainer's
room on crutches.
</P>
<P>
   The interception recalled Lucas' insertion into the 1997 finale
in Detroit when a victory would have put the Jets in the playoffs
in Parcells' first season as their coach. With his three quick
completions, the Jets appeared about to extend their 10-6 lead, but
then he threw an interception and was benched. The Jets eventually
lost, 13-10.
</P>
<P>
   For these Jets, the playoffs no longer exist. With what was a
difficult schedule anyway, they will be lucky to somehow win three
or four more games.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells' choice of Lucas was not surprising considering his
choice of words about Mirer after last Monday night's loss: ``I'm
not saying anything about Rick Mirer; I'm sure he's doing the best
he can.'' If Parcells had thought Mirer was capable of more, he
would have been openly critical. If not at that postgame news
conference, then during the week.
</P>
<P>
   By absolving Mirer, the coach had to be already thinking about
the change that surprised Mirer because Parcells hadn't even
mentioned the possibility during the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw this coming,'' said Mirer, who sounded more
confused than annoyed. ``The first time I spoke to him since last
week was 10:30 this morning when he told me Ray was starting. I
hadn't been told anything, so I didn't act like anything had
changed, but I can't worry about my feelings. It's not personal.
I'm not blaming anybody for what I've done or haven't done.''
</P>
<P>
   In two of Mirer's four starts as Testeverde's successor, the
Jets failed to score a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the sun's going to come up tomorrow,'' Mirer said, ``and
I'm going to be there to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   And he'll see it as the Jets quarterback again, at least until
Ray Lucas gets off his crutches.

HOMICIDES AND GUN VIOLENCE FALL SHARPLY, AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa., Mass., N.Y.)  (jw) 
 By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the clearest evidence yet that recent efforts to reduce gun
violence through new laws and police pressure are working, an FBI
report released Sunday shows that a 7 percent drop in homicides in
1998 was accounted for entirely by a decrease in killings committed
with guns.
</P>
<P>
   The report also indicates that a significant drop in robberies
carried out with guns helped account for a 10 percent decline in
robberies nationwide, the biggest decrease of any one category of
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the FBI's annual Uniform Crime Report found that
violent crimes and property crimes each dropped 6 percent last
year, marking the seventh consecutive year serious crime has fallen
and the largest single yearly decline in the 1990s. The national
murder rate has now fallen to 6.3 per 100,000, which was the level
in 1967, when crime first exploded in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Blumstein, a professor of criminology at Carnegie Mellon
University in Pittsburgh, said the most important news in the FBI
report was the evidence that the use of guns in homicides and
robberies was declining.
</P>
<P>
   ``These numbers suggest to me that the efforts to control the
availability of guns, especially in the hands of young people, are
having some effect,'' Blumstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Among these measures are increased efforts by the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to trace guns used in crimes; the
tighter federal restrictions imposed on gun purchases by the
so-called Brady law of 1994, named after James Brady, the former
White House press secretary who was wounded in the assassination
attempt on President Ronald Reagan; and new gun control laws passed
by numerous states, like those limiting purchasers to one handgun a
month.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the police and prosecutors in many cities,
including New York and Boston, have devised innovative strategies
to cut off the supply of illegal handguns to criminals and
juveniles or make them wary about carrying guns for fear of arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Another good sign in the report, Blumstein said, was that the
percentage of homicide victims who were female dropped 11 percent
in 1998, suggesting that legal and social efforts to prevent
domestic abuse were working.
</P>
<P>
   The report also found that the proportion of victims who knew
their killers rose to 51 percent in 1998 from 48 percent in 1997,
meaning that there were fewer homicides in which the victims were
strangers. This is another encouraging development, Blumstein said,
because the random, violent street crimes that mushroomed with the
crack epidemic of the late 1980s were disproportionately committed
by young people against strangers.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that arrests of juveniles for violent crimes
fell 8 percent in 1998, compared to a 4 percent drop in adult
arrests. It was an increase in juvenile crime in the late 1980s
that caused crime rates to soar.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Canada, the president of the Rheedlen Centers for
Children and Families, a nonprofit social service agency in Harlem,
said the drop in crime by young people was ``a reality I see.''
</P>
<P>
   While politicians and criminal justice experts have attributed
the decline in crime to tougher police tactics or longer prison
sentences, Canada said he believed much of the decrease was a
result of a change in the attitudes of young people in the inner
cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion of the late 1980s and early '90s that crime was an
option for young people, a way to get their sneakers or movie
tickets or buy an apartment building, that whole way of thinking
has changed dramatically,'' Canada said.
</P>
<P>
   The change has worked like a contagion in reverse, he said:
``The fewer kids who do crime, the fewer will do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor, Canada said, is that prolonged prosperity has
finally provided more jobs in poor minority neighborhoods, ``so
people now see other people working and they get the message that
work pays, crime doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   James Alan Fox, a criminal justice professor at Northeastern
University, cautioned that Americans might be becoming too
complacent after seven consecutive years of declining crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``What goes down will go up,'' Fox said. ``If you don't continue
to work hard at crime prevention, it's like going off a diet.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, police in New York City reported in June that the
number of killings to that point this year had increased 6 percent
over the comparable period in 1998. Fox said that trend had
continued.
</P>
<P>
   The new FBI report said there were 16,914 homicides nationwide
in 1998, of which 10,975 were committed with guns, down from a
total of 18,210 in 1997 of which 12,346 involved guns. The
reduction by 1,371 in murders involving a firearm was greater than
the drop of 1,296 in overall murders.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the report said that robberies committed with guns
fell to 38 percent of all robberies in 1998 from 40 percent in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Handguns were by far the most common weapons in killings,
accounting for 52 percent, while rifles and shotguns each accounted
for only 4 percent of all homicides, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The predominant role played by handguns in homicide underscores
the belief, held by officials in the 28 cities and counties that
have filed lawsuits against the firearms industry, that America's
gun violence problem is largely a handgun problem.
</P>
<P>
   As has been true for as long as crime statistics have been kept,
the FBI report found that the South had the highest homicide rate,
8 per 100,000, compared to 6 per 100,000 for the Midwest and West
and only 4 per 100,000 for the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI report is based on police arrest reports. It measures
the violent crimes of murder, robbery, rape and aggravated assault
and the property crimes of burglary, motor vehicle theft, larceny
and arson.

SBC COMMUNICATIONS TO OFFER HIGH-SPEED INTERNET CONNECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Firing the latest salvo in the local telephone industry's battle
against cable television providers, SBC Communications Inc. intends
to announce Monday that it will spend $6 billion in the next three
years to deploy high-speed Internet systems, people close to the
company said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Within three years, SBC intends to offer high-speed cyberspace
links to 80 percent of its customers using a technology called
digital subscriber line, or DSL, which uses normal telephone lines.
SBC recently completed its acquisition of the Ameritech Corp., the
Midwestern telephone giant, making SBC the local phone provider for
about a third of the nation's roughly 100 million households. That
deal made SBC the nation's No. 1 local telephone company, at least
until the Bell Atlantic Corp. completes its merger with the GTE
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   During the last few years, the cable television industry has
taken the lead in delivering continuous high-speed Internet links
to U.S. consumers, now serving perhaps 1 million households.
Encouraged by the prospects of using cable systems to deliver not
only Internet access but also interactive television and local
phone service, the AT&AMP;T Corp. has agreed to spend more than $90
billion to become the No. 1 cable carrier.
</P>
<P>
   The big local phone companies appear to have paid more attention
to merging with one another and fighting regulatory battles to win
entry to the long-distance market than to the cable industry. They
now appear to have deployed DSL to fewer than 100,000 customers.
But that may be changing. Bell Atlantic recently began offering DSL
in New York City and SBC under its new plan intends to double the
percentage of its customers with access to the technology. In its
last DSL announcement, in January, SBC committed to offering DSL to
only 40 percent of its customers.
</P>
<P>
   According to analysts and executives close to SBC, the company
plans to spend about $4.5 billion on DSL systems provided mostly by
Alcatel of France and on replacing some copper lines into local
networks with fiber-optic systems. The other $1.5 billion will be
spent mostly on deploying advanced transmission systems in the core
of the company's network, using a technology called asynchronous
transfer mode. The technology splits communications into small
pieces called cells.
</P>
<P>
   While spending on the new plan, known as Project Pronto, could
dilute SBC's earnings during the next few years, executives close
to the company expect the project to generate $3.5 billion in
annual revenue and $1.5 billion in annual savings by 2004.

IN AN UNUSUAL REPUBLICAN TACTIC, BUSH WOOS MINORITY VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., N.Y.)  (js) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ When Gov. George W. Bush of Texas swept into
Washington on Friday, his first stop was not an affluent suburb or
a ritzy business district, nor were his first encounters with
stalwart Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
   Instead he visited an elementary school catering primarily to
poor Hispanic students in a farming area, then headed straight to
another elementary school in a dowdy Seattle neighborhood to mingle
with Asian, Hispanic and African-American children. Only a
smattering of the boys and girls were white.
</P>
<P>
   It was reminiscent of the week before, when Bush was on the
opposite side of the country. During a three-day swing through New
York, he devoted a chunk of Monday morning to black parishioners at
a Baptist church in Buffalo, a portion of Tuesday morning to black
pupils at a charter school in Harlem and a slice of Wednesday
morning to Hispanic and African-American adults who were trying to
move from welfare to work with the help of a jobs center in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Although this kind of itinerary might be the exception for many
Republican candidates, it has become the rule for Bush, one of the
most interesting features of his campaign for the presidency, and
one of the most strategic.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Republican nor Democratic political analysts could
recall other leading Republican presidential candidates in recent
years who had spent as much time as Bush has venturing onto turf
that is not typically Republican and surrounding himself with
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Warfield, who was Bob Dole's press secretary in his 1996
presidential campaign, said: ``I cannot think, in the last several
Republican presidential cycles, of someone who has routinely, on a
weekly basis, made these sorts of appearances a staple of the
campaign. It's quite striking.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts noted that what might at first glance seem like an
excessively optimistic bid to chip off some of the Democratic
Party's most dependable voting blocs is also a vehicle to another
goal, perhaps more attainable and arguably more pivotal in
determining who becomes the next president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's overtures to minorities _ the physical and visual
complement to his oratorical slogan of compassionate conservatism _
is his most powerful signal to swing voters that he occupies enough
territory near the center of the political spectrum to warrant
their allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   Bush acknowledged that he wanted that message to be heard not
only by minorities but also by other voters simply taking the
measure of what kind of Republican he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope people will say, `Well, you know, it's interesting, I
turn on my TV, I see Governor Bush campaigning in places that most
Republicans don't go,''' Bush said in an interview last week.
``Maybe that will get people to listen to what I'm trying to say.''
</P>
<P>
   His chief campaign strategist, Karl Rove, said, ``This shows you
that he's a Republican who independents or Democrats can vote for,
because he doesn't have all the rough edges you may have come to
expect of some Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a sustained demonstration, with a payoff in the kind of
footage of Bush that makes its way onto television screens and the
kind of photographs of Bush that make their way into newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Look back at pictures of a Sunday afternoon in early March when
he introduced the exploratory committee for his presidential
campaign. Except for his wife, Laura, the two people standing
closest to him are both black: Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., and
Condoleezza Rice, the former provost of Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   Recall the dignitaries flanking him on the stage of the
Manhattan hotel ballroom where he recently delivered an education
policy address, a speech that digressed to talk about shedding what
he characterized as the grouchy image of the Republican Party.
About half of the group was black.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to the campaign of Vice President Al Gore, the
front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, privately
fume about the prevalence of this imagery, which they say obscures
the reality that Bush would do less to actually help black and
Hispanic voters than someone like Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Their complaint underscores a potential risk of Bush's approach:
that it will be seen as an empty, showy series of gestures simply
intended to grease the wheels of his progress toward the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   That was how several white parents who happened to be at the
Kimball Elementary School in Seattle on Friday said they had
interpreted Bush's appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He walks into a school that's multi-ethnic, puts his hands
around the kids,'' said Mary Austin, who has children in the first
and third grades at Kimball. ``It's an obvious ploy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush was not dashing to or from a fund-raiser on
Friday, his campaign trips often adhere to a familiar rhythm:
visits to settings inhabited by poor or working-class minorities
interspersed with forays into banquet halls filled with
upper-middle-class or affluent donors, most of them white.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the former stops, in one way or another, try to showcase
or promote Bush's proposals that faith-based organizations be
encouraged to do more social work and that parents in poor areas be
able to benefit from charter schools and more school choice.
</P>
<P>
   Political strategists said that some of the overlapping groups
of voters who may snap to attention _ and could well decide the
presidential contest of 2000 _ are women, Roman Catholics and
suburban residents.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton depended on an overwhelming advantage among
female voters to solidify his victories in 1992 and 1996. Celinda
Lake, a Democratic pollster, said that if Bush got the Republican
nomination and wanted to collapse that gender gap in 2000, an
aggressive appeal to minorities was as clever a method as any.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way of saying he's going to try to bring America
together,'' Lake said, ``and women care a lot about that. Bill
Clinton said to women, `I'm going to have an America that's
inclusive,' and George Bush is saying, `I get it, too.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lake said that she could not think of another recent
Republican presidential candidate who got it to the same degree as
Bush. ``He's really, really smart,'' she said. ``He knows people,
and he knows politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Other strategists noted that Catholic voters also wanted to see
in a presidential candidate a measure of sensitivity and a stated
concern for less-privileged Americans, and that Bush's attention to
minorities was a clear effort to meet those criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Rove said that it was an important gesture for suburban voters
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The growing diversity of America causes a lot of thoughtful
people in the suburbs to say that our country would be better off
with someone who could relate to that diversity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several advisers to Bush said they believed that Bush also stood
a good chance of doing better with minority voters than Republican
presidential candidates have traditionally done.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, as a candidate for governor in 1994 and 1998 and as
governor for almost five years, Bush has been aggressive in his
courtship of Hispanic voters, apparently to significant avail.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, for example, an exit poll by the Voter News Service
showed that Bush had captured 49 percent of the state's Hispanic
vote. Although subsequent surveys quibbled with that number,
lowering it by about 10 points, it was still much better than the
21 percent of the Hispanic vote that Bob Dole, the Republican
nominee, netted in the 1996 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   The Voter News Service also showed Bush with 27 percent of the
black vote in Texas in 1998; two years earlier, Dole had received
just 12 percent of the black vote nationally.
</P>
<P>
   But whether Bush can even come close to replicating his
statewide numbers in a national contest is uncertain; in Texas, he
was an incumbent running against a Democratic opponent who never
got any traction.
</P>
<P>
   His advisers believe that his best chance is with Hispanic
voters, and that could be the key to putting California, which has
the richest trove of electoral votes, into play.
</P>
<P>
   His advisers say that when Bush unveils television
advertisements in the weeks ahead, those commercials will be filled
with Hispanic and black faces, much as the commercials for his 1998
governor's race were, and much as many of Bush's presidential
campaign appearances are.
</P>
<P>
   Bush drew attention to this in his remarks at the Mount Olive
Baptist Church in Buffalo, which he visited with Gov. George E.
Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   ``This must be quite a shock,'' Bush said, ``not only to have
two governors, but two Republican governors.''

MYSTERY DEEPENS IN DEATH OF LOBSTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Marine experts suspect that a mysterious pathogen may
have killed tens of thousands of lobsters in Long Island Sound this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   The die-off, described as the worst to hit Long Island Sound in
nearly a decade, has alarmed hundreds of lobstermen in New York and
Connecticut, and it has prompted extensive laboratory testing by
state and federal environmental officials.
</P>
<P>
   While cautioning that much more lab work needed to be done,
Gordon Colvin, the marine resources director of the New York
Department of Environmental Conservation, said Sunday that
water-quality tests had eliminated two possibilities _ pollution
and low levels of oxygen in the water.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that blood samples taken from lobsters did not
provide any solid evidence of gaffkemia, a common and often fatal
bacterial infection in lobsters.
</P>
<P>
   The working hypothesis, he said, was that some other bacterium
or virus was killing the lobsters, which became sluggish before
dying, although they otherwise appeared normal.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few weeks, officials in New York and Connecticut
have taken blood from lobsters and sent it to several laboratories,
including the University of Arizona in Tucson, the Food and Drug
Administration in Washington and the National Marine Fisheries
Service in Milford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there is no reason to fear eating lobsters from the
Sound, said Byron Young, chief of the finfish and crustacean unit
of the New York Department of Environmental Conservation. No one
has reported getting sick after eating lobster, and cooking
lobsters in boiling water would kill any microbes, Young said.
</P>
<P>
   But for those who fish the Sound, the problem is that too many
lobsters are already dead by the time they are pulled from traps.
In recent weeks, some lobstermen have stopped fishing altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just basically a losing proposition,'' said Robert
Eberhardt, a 52-year-old lobsterman who works out of Northport, a
harbor village on the North Shore of Long Island. ``Between fuel,
bait and crew, you come out behind.''

JOHN CLARK, 73, PSYCHIATRIST WHO STUDIED SECTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Minn., Ariz., Vt.)  (lb) 
 By ERIC NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. John G. Clark, a Harvard psychiatrist whose study of new
religious sects in the 1970s raised public awareness of the
overwhelming influence of some groups over their members, died on
Oct. 7 at a nursing home in Belmont, Mass. He was 73 and had been
suffering from a long illness, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark immersed himself in the study of new or generally
unfamiliar sects like the Unification Church, the Church of
Scientology and the International Society for Krishna
Consciousness. Over time, he counseled more than 500 former members
of the groups and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Margaret Thaler Singer, an expert on such groups and an
emeritus professor of psychology at the University of California at
Berkeley, said Clark was among the first professionals to turn
attention to the subject, even before the mass suicide of People's
Temple members in Jonestown, Guyana, in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, Clark wrote a widely cited guest editorial
in The Journal of the American Medical Association warning about
the growing power of such religious groups. He was also called as
an expert witness before a congressional committee investigating
religious sects. ``People paid attention,'' Dr. Singer said.
</P>
<P>
   In his editorial, Clark wrote, ``The new youth cults, though
usually self-styled as religious for purposes of First Amendment
privileges, are increasingly dangerous to the health of their
converts and menacing to their critics.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Clark himself had to be convinced of what was then not
a generally accepted principle: that an ordinary person, not
suffering from any significant psychiatric problem, could within a
matter of days be persuaded through simple group pressures to walk
away from a previous life and devote everything to a particular
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, like most psychiatrists, initially he was rather
skeptical,'' said Dr. Michael Langone, executive director of the
American Family Foundation, a 20-year-old organization that works
against such sects. Clark was active in the organization.
</P>
<P>
   But Clark's views changed as he met with more patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Orthodox psychiatric opinion has generally viewed conversion
to deviant groups as a function of longstanding conflicts within
individuals,'' he said in a 1982 interview. ``Our evidence strongly
suggests that these individuals are succumbing to pressures within
the cult milieu, pressures that can induce radical personality
changes as easily in normally developing people as among disturbed
ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the 1980s, Clark was called upon by the news media,
families and psychiatrists for his expertise on the influence of
sects.
</P>
<P>
   The Church of Scientology objected strongly to Clark's
assertions, and the church and Clark battled in court. Clark said
the church had engaged in a campaign of harassment against him. In
1988, he settled with the church and received an undisclosed amount
of money, but agreed never to discuss the group publicly again.
</P>
<P>
   John Gordon Clark was born on March 3, 1926, in St. Cloud,
Minn., one of three boys who grew up to become doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Clark graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1953 and became
an assistant clinical professor of psychology some years later. He
worked on the staffs of Massachusetts General and McLean Hospitals
while at Harvard. He continued to see patients through the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Clark is survived by his wife, the former Eleanor Sherwood of
Weston, Mass.; two brothers, Robert of Minneapolis, and Bruce of
Tucson, Ariz.; a daughter, Catherine Clark of Waltham, Mass., and a
son, Gordon, of Springfield, Vt.

JEAN SHEPHERD, A RACONTEUR AND A WIT OF RADIO, IS DEAD
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Fla., Ill., Ind., Ohio)  (nk) 
 By ANTHONY RAMIREZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jean Shepherd, the New York radio raconteur and author whose
rambling jazzlike monologues on the air puzzled many but delighted
fans over two decades, died Saturday. He was believed to be in his
70s.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin Zwilling, his friend and business adviser, said in a
statement that Shepherd died of natural causes at 3:20 a.m. in LeeMemorial Hospital near his home in Sanibel Island, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Shepherd was best known most recently for his tart narration of
the 1983 film ``A Christmas Story,'' a fond if slightly dyspeptic
evocation of Christmastime in 1940s Indiana, told from the point of
view of Ralphie Parker, 9, whose dream Christmas present is a Red
Ryder BB gun.
</P>
<P>
   With its grouchy parents, confrontations with schoolyard bullies
and a child's hapless tongue frozen to a flagpole, the film has
become a staple of holiday television. It was adapted from ``Red
Ryder Nails the Cleveland Street Kid,'' one of the stories in
Shepherd's best-selling 1966 book, ``In God We Trust, All Others
Pay Cash.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepherd spent 21 years on WOR-AM in New York City beginning in
1956. But in recent years, he performed infrequently on radio, the
last time in September 1996 on WFAN-AM in New York with his friend
Zwilling.
</P>
<P>
   Shepherd was a king of talk radio before it was known as talk
radio, and his style was of a piece with his sure pacing and flat
Midwestern accent. Typical was his description of children walking
to school in the winter: ``Kids plodded ... through
forty-five-mile-an-hour gales, tilting forward like tiny furred
radiator ornaments, moving stiffly over the barren clattering
ground with only the faint glint of two eyes peering out of a mound
of moving clothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyhood memories of small-town characters would be transformed
by Shepherd's comic exaggeration: ``Big Al was wedge-shaped; pure
sinew, gristle, and covered with a thick, bristly mat of primitive
fur. Numerous broken noses had reduced his nostrils to
blow-holes,'' he wrote of a college football player in ``A Fistful
of Fig Newtons'' (Doubleday &AMP; Co., 1982).
</P>
<P>
   A magazine writer once described Shepherd as a ``philosopher
without portfolio'' and a wit who never told a joke. He described
himself as a humorist rather than a comic. ``A humorist looks
outward and sees the world,'' Shepherd said. ``A comic looks inward
and sees himself.''
</P>
<P>
   On radio, he developed a wide Northeastern following, which a
reviewer writing in 1970 in The New York Times described as a
``cult of intense proportions.'' The reviewer went on to describe
the cult's typical rituals: ``the suburban college student, with
the bottle of Chianti, a girl, a pizza, parked by the edge of Long
Island Sound, listening to Jean Shepherd's nightly WOR radio
program.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepherd talked little about his private life. Accounts differ
on when he was born in Chicago. His date of birth has been given
variously as either July 21 or July 26, in years ranging from 1921
to 1929. He grew up within commuting distance of Chicago, in
Hammond, Ind., which he called ``Hohman'' in his stories.
</P>
<P>
   Zwilling said Shepherd's third wife, Leigh Brown, his agent and
producer, died last year after 21 years of marriage, that they had
no children and that ``there were no survivors.''
</P>
<P>
   But Randall Shepherd, 48, telephoned The Times on Saturday
night. He identified himself as the son of Shepherd and his first
wife, the former Joan Laverne Warner, who lives in Princeton, N.J.
The younger Shepherd said that his father left him and his mother
when Randall was 6, shortly before his parents divorced in 1957.
His sister, Adrian Shepherd, now 42, was born shortly after
Shepherd left the family, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went out of his way not to acknowledge that he even had
us,'' said the younger Shepherd, a film editor in Irvington, N.Y.,
who described their relationship with their father as estranged.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Shepherd said he was not aware of his father's
second marriage to the actress Lois Nettleton in 1961, which ended
six years later. The son said he did not know whether his uncle,
also named Randall Shepherd, was still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Jean Shepherd told interviewers that he had many
odd jobs, including mail boy in a steel mill and an equipment
installer in the U.S. Army Signal Corps. He said he attended, but
did not graduate from, Indiana University before starting in radio
at WSAI in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   His reflections were often mordant. In a 1975 radio performance,
Shepherd closed with this observation: ``Can you imagine  &UR; 4,000
 &LR; years passing, and you're not even a  &UR; memory &LR; ? Think about it,
friends. It's not just a possibility. It is a certainty.''

SPORTS COLUMN: TORRE REMAINS CALM IN THE EYE OF THE STORM

<P>
   BOSTON _ The Red Sox were strutting, the Boss was lurking and a
cell phone was ringing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That for me?'' Joe from Brooklyn asked. Assured it was not, he
said: ``You never know.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees manager knows how many native New Yorkers and a
certain Ohio-born Floridian react when the other team gets noisy
and palms get sweaty in the midst of a baseball playoff series.
Vinny from Queens and Mike from Montclair and George from Tampa
start dialing respective outlets, voicing their displeasure,
envisioning doom.
</P>
<P>
   But not the Captain of Calm, Joe from Brooklyn, county of Kings.
``When we set the pitching, we made decisions,'' he said after Game
3 of the American League Championship Series when a reporter probed
for a sign of Roger Clemens-caused panic. ``We have no reason to
change that.''
</P>
<P>
   No reason to project a jittery front because the Red Sox didn't
faint after losing the first two games, and pounded 21 hits in Game
3, and because the Yankees bats had, at best, been pedestrian in
the series, and the mere thought of Pedro Martinez in a potential
Game 7 was, until further notice, looming over them like a
sharpened sword.
</P>
<P>
   No reason to sit light-hitting Joe Girardi Sunday night in Game
4, or move the aching and slumping Paul O'Neill down in the order.
No reason to worry that a left-hander, Andy Pettitte, was on the
loose in a pivotal game at a time when the Red Sox had scored 45
runs in their three previous games at Fenway Park. No reason to
show them signs of alarm just because they beat the Yankees
Saturday like a drum and George from Tampa happened to be in sight
of reporters for the first time in the series.
</P>
<P>
   New Englanders were inching toward making their hearts available
at the risk of having them broken again. They were opening their
arms to embrace the Red Sox as destiny's team at the expense of the
hated Yanks, with George from Tampa and the rest of the callers one
defeat away from putting finger to speed dial.
</P>
<P>
   Joe from Brooklyn said he was not worried, or stressed out. He
was, at the risk of sacrilege, enjoying himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you do this, the more fun it is,'' he said. ``For
sure last year, after winning 114 games, you felt sort of obligated
to have to go to the World Series and win. Otherwise people would
have downplayed what you accomplished. This is more fun, and maybe
I have approaching it that way because where I was six months ago
and knowing what was going on in my body and my life.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when everyone but the army is part of the big-event
crowd control, Joe from Brooklyn has become the chief of the
anti-hysteria police. He is the wise paternal face of New York
sports. That has always been his nature, his approach, since he
took managerial control of a team long fueled by panic and fear.
</P>
<P>
   Now he works a few months removed from believing he'd been
handed ``a death sentence'' upon being diagnosed with prostate
cancer last spring. He operates in his fourth Yankees season
boosted by the capital of his two World Series championships, the
perfect steward for a team that has won with style and class.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the season of second guessing, Joe from
Brooklyn floats above the jerking knees, not having every decision
analyzed like a nuclear arms treaty. Others are always one move
away from facing the tribunal of baseball geniuses. What was Bobby
Cox thinking Sunday, trying a suicide squeeze with the bases loaded
and two strikes on his hitter, the pitcher? If you have a week, we
can get started on Bobby Valentine or Buck Showalter, the genius
who double-switched his best player out of his team's elimination
game.
</P>
<P>
   If it had been Valentine _ who invites second guesses the way
politicians do soft money _ who had sent an anxious Clemens into
Fenway for such disastrous results, he would have surely had some
explaining to do. Is this entirely fair? Another manager might have
factored the potential fallout into a decision of pitching a
left-hander in Fenway when he didn't have to.
</P>
<P>
   Not Joe from Brooklyn, who is not worried about the
sportswriters or the callers or even George from Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very compassionate man when you do lose,'' Joe from
Brooklyn said of his boss. ``I think he's a tougher taskmaster when
you're winning, to keep you from taking your eye off the finish
line. When you lose, he's there to support you.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Joe from Brooklyn could believe this about George from
Tampa and the tough New York critics. Only he could be so relaxed
Sunday night, in the face of all this Fenway fuss.

   BAZARAK, Afghanistan _ Those who only had their houses burned or
crops destroyed often apologize because their story is not bad
enough. They are sheepish about complaining.
</P>
<P>
   And so they lead the way to the worse off, the irretrievably
broken or the unbearably sorrowful _ the children with parents who
were murdered as they watched or the men whose wives were carried
off screaming or the old woman whose story no one is sure of, but
she has been sobbing for two months now, fingering a red flower
embroidered on a pink cloth.
</P>
<P>
   Afghanistan's ruling Taliban militia, along with thousands of
Pakistanis lit with the fervor of jihad, went on a destructive
spree this summer, killing wantonly, emptying entire towns,
machine-gunning livestock, sawing down fruit trees, blasting apart
irrigation canals. It was a binge of blood lust and mayhem
described with consistent detail by witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Among the survivors are an estimated 65,000 refugees who have
escaped to the Panjshir Valley, a nape of land nestled within the
rugged Himalayan peaks of the Hindu Kush. Huddled in makeshift
tents fashioned from cloth and plastic, relentlessly foraging for
firewood, they are free for now from their tormentors but not yet
safe from the famously deep snows and furious winds of the winter
soon to come.
</P>
<P>
   On July 28, the Taliban began a long-anticipated summer
offensive. The militia, which has been on a largely unstoppable
march since 1995, wanted to take command of the 10 percent to 20
percent of the country not yet under its control.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   This time, they attacked in three places, sending their main
juggernaut into the Shamali Valley just north of Kabul. More than
6,000 soldiers rolled through towns and villages in what survivors
describe as a well-coordinated assault supported by tanks,
artillery and aerial bombardments.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The onslaught was overpowering, but after a week, as the Taliban
celebrated victory, they were stunned by a night-time
counterattack. The opposition forces of Ahmad Shah Massoud, their
lone remaining nemesis, hit back, springing ambushes and slaying
hundreds _ perhaps more than 1,000 _ of the Taliban forces, who
reportedly suffered even more losses in a disorderly retreat.
</P>
<P>
   It was a military triumph, but much of the land recovered was
already ruins and scorched earth.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did they have to kill my cows and goats, and why cut down
the mulberry trees and stomp through my garden?'' asked Mohammad
Kasim, 59, a refugee who now lives here in the town of Bazarak, his
home a tent of thin and porous blankets held up by branches.
</P>
<P>
   Kasim is a man with a long angular face topped by a turban and
completed with a thick under-hang of beard. He had the anxious,
bewildered look of someone terrified of the future. ``We have
nothing now except for God,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nafas Jon, 45, a gaunt, tired woman with six children, has taken
sanctuary along with 1,000 others in Bazarak's small, decrepit
school. ``The Taliban took my husband out of the house and cut him
down,'' she said evenly. ``They were killing everyone who looked
young, thinking they must be soldiers. I screamed then and I cry
now. We have nothing left.''
</P>
<P>
   She sat in a space made private by cloths hung from rope, a
hovel barely three-feet high. ``We returned once to see our
house,'' Mrs. Jon said, pausing a few seconds to frame the memory
in her mind. ``The ceiling is now on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Guldara, Saraykhoja, Bagram, Karabagh: from these and other
towns to the north of Kabul, dozens of refugees _ interviewed
independently _ had much the same story to tell, of people shot in
their homes, fires everywhere, beatings, abductions, mass flight.
</P>
<P>
   To them, the Taliban's purpose was obvious. Afghanistan, for
thousands of years one of the great crossroads of Asia, has endured
invasions and migrations that have left it a demanding
anthropological puzzle of ethnicities and tribes. The Taliban are
largely ethnic Pathans and they wanted to not only rid the area of
ethnic Tajiks, whose resistance to them has been steadfast, but to
leave their enemies with nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The militia's leaders have explained their summer rampage
differently, calling it a humanitarian act. They insist that
Massoud's forces _ the so-called United Front _ have used these
towns as redoubts for launching attacks. The populace lived in
constant danger.
</P>
<P>
   To ``save'' the citizenry, the Taliban forced most of them to
flee; others were trucked to Kabul, the nation's capital, or the
city of Jalalabad. Some 12,500 displaced people _ more than 8,000
of them children _ are living in the compound of the closed Soviet
embassy in Kabul, according to a U.N. report. More than 2,000 Tajik
men are locked within the cramped stone caverns of Kabul's
Pul-i-Charki Prison, said a spokesman for Massoud.
</P>
<P>
   There are an estimated 130,000 refugees in all, the largest
concentration of them here in the Panjshir Valley. For two and a
half months now, they have been pondering the devastation to their
earthly possessions and growing fixated on the icy challenge to
their survival that lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   International aid groups have been late to mobilize, apparently
unsure of whether the refugees could go back home _ or if those
homes still stood. The agencies are now swiftly setting up shop,
dividing the tasks: shelter, fuel, bread, blankets, medicine.
</P>
<P>
   This has not been a high-profile crisis because this is no
longer a high-profile place. In the 1980s, the West lavished
attention _ and weapons _ on Afghan warriors charging down from the
mountains to match the might of the invading Soviet army. These
days, few people are watching.
</P>
<P>
   Afghanistan is remote, distanced further by 21 years of war that
have reversed the course of modernization. Indeed, much of the
necessary aid must be carried over a single overland route from
Tajikistan. It requires a journey of up to 10 days on a narrow,
unpaved road pocked with ruts huge enough to swallow a car.
Momentous effort will be needed merely to keep the high-altitude
mountain passes from becoming snowbound.
</P>
<P>
   ``If both sides would agree not to shoot at aircraft, we could
have an airlift,'' said Fayyez Shah, who heads the U. N. team in
Bazarak. ``Or a humanitarian corridor could be opened on some other
roads.''

   The Afghan government _ the one driven out of Kabul in 1996 and
still recognized by most of the world _ continues to operate, if
feebly, here in the nation's far northeast. Kamaluddin Nasami, its
planning director for the refugee crisis, said he is grateful for
the help of the aid agencies but is frustrated by their delays.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tell me the road is unsafe, but tell me where and we will
make it safe,'' he said. ``The fighting is not on the road; it is
to the sides of the road.''
</P>
<P>
   The refugees also complain. They are receiving wheat for bread,
and some have the use of bright blue plastic tarps courtesy of the
U.N. But the nights are cold, the children undernourished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each organization comes and makes a list and then nothing
happens,'' said Gulam Said, who lives amid a collection of 100
tents along the turbulent current of the Panjshir River. ``What
shall we do? Every week, we have two children die.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The air here teems with tragedy. The accounts of the refugees
rival those of Kosovo, the horror only lessened by its numbing
repetition.
</P>
<P>
   With fighting still going on, and the deserted towns still along
the front lines, the extent of the death and destruction is
impossible to measure. Individual stories cannot be confirmed by
first-hand observation. They are supported only by the uniformity
of their particulars.
</P>
<P>
   People are eager to tell these stories, their personal losses
now a vital part of their identity.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the many clusters of tents, Mohammad Wali, a
round-faced 10-year-old boy, poked his head through a crowd and
called out, ``They shot my father and I saw it.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   He said there had been a hard knocking on their door. His father
nervously walked toward the gate. The men outside fired
Kalashnikovs. With his father dead, he ran back inside as fast as
he could. His mother, he said, ``needed to know about it right
away.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Shakar Gul, her arms around her nephew's waist, said the boy,
Gules Tan, is 3. ``His father was killed, and his mother was taken
away,'' the aunt said.
</P>
<P>
   She sat on a rock and occasionally lifted the cloth that covered
her head, the traditional chador, to conceal her face. ``He cries
out, `Where is my mother?' '' she said. ``We tell him she has gone
away but will come back soon. In time, God willing, he will forget
her.''
</P>

<P>
   Lida, 15, like many Afghans, uses only one name. She was wearing
a purple dress with paisley decorations, and while her eyes were
moist, she refused to let tears escape to her smooth cheeks. Her
younger sisters had designated her to speak for the family.
</P>
<P>
   She said, ``At first, they took my brother Sardar and my father
pleaded, `Do not kill my only son,' and then after they shot
Sardar, my father cried so much they shot him, too.''
</P>
<P>
   People wandered out of the ragged, homemade tents to serve up
their grief. A man scavenged through his pockets to find the tiny
snapshot of his murdered son. A weeping woman, Najila, 20, said her
parents were killed by a bomb as they drank tea. ``They had been
discussing how we were going to run away,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Akbar Shah, 50, said his sister died as their family fled toward
the valley, part of a flood of terrified people walking and
stumbling on the cramped road: ``She was OK, she was coming with
me. Then someone yelled, `Run, the Taliban are coming!' and
suddenly she just sat on the dirt, her heart stopped and she fell
over.''
</P>
<P>
   The Panjshir Valley was a two-day journey on foot from their
ruined homes. As refugees rushed across the crowded bridge near Gul
Bahar at night, they could not help but jostle each other. Many
fell off, grasping at the empty air, going down through the
darkness onto the rocks and water below.
</P>
<P>
   Zaker, a 12-year-old boy in a torn brown sweater, said he, too,
lost his father to the Taliban's busy Kalashnikovs. Then his mother
tumbled off the Gul Bahar bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I listened for her voice for a long time, and then went on,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Tajiks speak a dialect of Persian called Dari. Their
attackers, they said, spoke not only Pashto, the tongue of the
Pathans, but Urdu and Punjabi, languages more commonly spoken in
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Mullah Mohammad Omar, the Taliban's supreme leader, had called
upon Muslims in madrasahs, or religious schools, to join the jihad.
Thousands of students in neighboring Pakistan share the Taliban's
puritanical interpretation of Islam. They were openly bussed across
major border crossings and given weapons training.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the refugees, Sardar Agha, 28, a man in a
wheelchair, insisted that some of his attackers were foreigners.
``I know Afghans,'' he said. ``They were not Afghans.''
</P>
<P>
   Some made other distinctions. Taliban army regulars enforced
cultural taboos, smashing TV sets and ripping apart music tapes.
Newer recruits, whether Afghans or Pakistanis, were more likely to
be thieves, a few refugees said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd bust into your house, hold a gun to the head of your
children and demand either money or guns,'' said a woman from
Kapisa province, a former literature professor. She asked for
anonymity because she had relatives still in Kabul. ``If you
complained to the Talibs, they'd tell you that they didn't control
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the refugees here may be poorer than they were, but not
all are poor. A few escaped by car, their most valued possessions
tethered to the roof with rope.
</P>
<P>
   Some families from Bagram, confessing prosperity, had several
hand-made oriental carpets stacked against their tent walls, and
others to make soft floors atop the stony soil.
</P>
<P>
   But there are not many comforts to purchase in the Panjshir
Valley. In Bazarak, there is no telephone service. Electrical power
comes only from private generators, and the fuel to run them is
exorbitantly priced. The river is both a wash basin and a toilet.
</P>
<P>
   Basic shelter for the refugee multitude has been left to ACTED,
a French charity. The agency has a plan: Public buildings will be
insulated. Damaged houses will be repaired. Twenty-five hundred
``survival cells'' will be built _ simple dwellings with walls of
stone and mortar, windows of plastic sheeting and roofs of bamboo.
Building is just getting started. The planners hope it will be
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Priority will be given to the hundreds of families now living in
mosques, which need to be vacated. With the weather getting cold,
men no longer want to say their prayers on the rooftops of their
holy places.
</P>
<P>
   Bazarak's mosque is a modest yellow building, a single open
space with a green carpet. Fifty-one families are living there.
Outside, women feed wood chips into cooking fires, their heads bent
to the ground, their breath used to stoke the embers.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby is the town's school. Many of its desks have become the
undersized walls for cave-like spaces. Hanging blankets often
separate one family from the next. The largest room has the
appearance of a multi-colored maze.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the small spaces, near an open doorway, a woman named
Anita, 35, spoke of the death of the youngest of her eight
children. The girl's name was Farastha, age 1. The child began to
cry and quiver when the Taliban bombardment began and never seemed
to stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``She died of fear,'' the mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Twilight had come, and the school was growing dark. Anita pulled
close one of her small children and buttoned his sweater. The wind
had stirred, sweeping down as it does from the mountains at night,
another reminder of the winter day by day creeping near.

 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The Census Bureau has begun to revise its
definition of what constitutes poverty in the United States,
experimenting with a formula that would drop millions more families
below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau's new approach would in effect raise the income
threshold for living above poverty to $19,500 for a family of four,
from the $16,600 now considered sufficient. Suddenly, 46 million
Americans, or 17 percent of the population, would be recognized as
officially below the line, not the 12.7 percent announced last
month, the lowest level in nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   A strong economy has undoubtedly lifted many families, but not
nearly as many as the official statistics suggest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is certainly our opinion, and the opinion of every
researcher we have talked to, that something should be done to
update the poverty measure,'' said Edward Welniak, chief of the
Census Bureau's Income Statistics Branch.
</P>
<P>
   Fixing a poverty line has always been a subjective endeavor. The
current formula was created for President Lyndon B. Johnson to keep
score in his ``war on poverty'' and has remained unchanged since
1965 except for adjustments to allow for inflation. It is based on
a minimal food budget that no longer represents U.S. eating habits
or spending. The Census Bureau's new Experimental Poverty Measures
are an effort to determine what poor people must really spend on
food, clothing, housing and life's little extras.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no scientific way to set a new poverty line,'' said
Rebecca M. Blank, dean of the School of Public Policy at the
University of Michigan. ``What there is here are a set of judgment
calls, now being made, about what is needed to lift people to a
socially acceptable standard of living.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Sociologists and economists who study what people must earn to
escape poverty in the United States place the line even higher than
the Census Bureau's experimental measures, which were published in
July and are now the focus of a growing debate. They put the
threshold for a family of four somewhere between $21,000 and
$28,000. That is partly because the bureau's criteria, based
largely on a study by the National Academy of Sciences, do not
allow extra cash for emergencies _ to fix a car, say, or repair a
leaky roof, or to buy health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Americans, in opinion polls, draw the poverty line
above $20,000, saying it takes at least that much, if not more, to
``get along in their community,'' to ``live decently'' or to avoid
hardship.
</P>
<P>
   But a higher threshold means government spending would have to
rise to pay for benefits that are tied to the poverty level, like
food stamps and Head Start programs. That would require an
incursion into the budget surplus that neither Republicans nor
Democrats seek.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the White House, which would have to authorize
a change in the poverty formula, is proceeding cautiously. ``We
have at least a couple of years more work to do,'' an
administration official said, passing the decision for redefining
poverty to the next administration.
</P>
<P>
   For Crystal McConnell and Austin Johnson, an Indianapolis
couple, the poverty line, in their view, is definitely north of the
$22,250 they expect to earn this year _ even in Indianapolis, where
incomes and living costs closely match the national average.
</P>
<P>
   The couple do not seem poor. They live in a rented brick
bungalow in a neighborhood of similarly modest, well-kept homes.
The brightly colored plastic toys of their two sons are strewn
about the living room, which is furnished comfortably with
faux-leather sofas placed around a glass and wood coffee table.
</P>
<P>
   But on a recent visit, the refrigerator was nearly empty. Five
small packages of pork chops and chicken parts had to serve as the
centerpiece of family meals for the next 11 days, when there would
again be money to buy food.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go to my mom's after church sometimes for lunch and, during
the week, sometimes for dinner,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 24, and Ms. McConnell, 22, have full-time jobs. As
commuters and workers, occupying a home in a presentable
neighborhood, they hardly fit American images of hardscrabble
lives. But poverty licks at them.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is without health insurance, which he considers beyond
the family's means. Once his provisional job as a load planner _
balancing the weight of cargo loaded onto jet aircraft _ becomes
permanent, company health insurance will kick in. Meanwhile, the
family is going into debt.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McConnell has health insurance from her employer, a
community center where she is a caseworker. But she did not have
insurance last year and still owes a hospital $630 for
emergency-room treatment of her foot, injured in a car accident.
</P>
<P>
   Housing, like health insurance, is a big hurdle. The poor are
twice as likely as the nonpoor to rent rather than own their homes,
according to a Labor Department study.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   That is the pattern in Indianapolis, a city whose housing costs
are right at the median nationally. When the poor do buy homes,
subsidies often grease the way, as they will for Florence Farmer, a
36-year-old single mother of two sons. The West Side Development
Corp., publicly subsidized, is renovating homes in rundown
Indianapolis neighborhoods and then giving away down payments for
them. Not many of the homes are available, but Ms. Farmer managed
to get one for $50,000, qualifying with her medical secretary's
income of $17,000, an amount $4,000 above the official poverty
level for a family her size. Her mortgage payment, $416 a month _
the maximum she says she can afford _ will be almost the same as
what she now pays to rent a two-bedroom house.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Ms. McConnell are struggling to stay in a
neighborhood with a good public school for their elder son, Cyrin,
who is 4. They moved to their three-bedroom bungalow in January,
paying $600 a month in rent, a sum Ms. McConnell says they cannot
really afford. The October rent came due on the first of this month
and was paid, but not the utilities, which were also due. The
couple gambled that gas and electricity would not be cut off before
their next paychecks, in midmonth. The nation's poor are four times
as likely as the nonpoor to have their utilities cut off, the Labor
Department found in its study.
</P>
<P>
   The Indiana Economic Development Council, concerned about the
proliferation of low-wage service jobs, has produced ``basic
needs'' budgets for families here. The council concluded, for
example, that a single parent with one or two children, working
full-time, needs $20,700 to stay out of poverty _ not counting
child care costs.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Schrock, a researcher for the council, which works to
attract companies and new jobs to Indiana, said: ``We have to
understand where the economy is moving in terms of job creation,
and it is unrealistic to think that we will move away from the
creation of lower-wage jobs in the service and hospitality
industries.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Such concerns played no role in creating the poverty formula now
in use. Seeking good numbers in his ``war on poverty,'' Johnson
resisted setting the initial poverty threshold too high. Finally he
approved a formula based on a food budget designed to barely
provide sufficient nutrition _ and then only if ``the housewife is
a careful shopper, a skillful cook and a good manager who will
prepare all the family's meals at home.''
</P>
<P>
   To arrive at a poverty threshold, the bare food budget was
multiplied by three; at the time, food was one-third of the average
family's purchases. Today it is about one-fifth, but neither the
formula nor the original food budget has ever changed.
</P>
<P>
   The new thinking has several facets. It redefines income to
include for the first time noncash income like food stamps and rent
subsidies. It puts child care and other work-related expenses in a
separate category because they vary so much from family to family.
And it tries to determine what a low-income family must spend not
only to survive but to preserve a reasonable amount of
self-respect.
</P>
<P>
   A telephone is considered essential. So is housing in good
repair. Clothing is no longer just to keep warmor covered; looking
decent is a critical status symbol today. That is why Isaac Pinner,
a 16-year-old ninth grader and his sister Lea, 12, and in the
seventh grade, insist they are not poor.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the living room of their rundown rented home with
their mother, Julie Pinner, a 35-year-old receptionist and clerk,
they resent her decision to talk to a reporter about poverty. ``I
get what I want,'' Lea said, and her brother agreed. ``Why talk to
us?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by their clothes, they do not seem poor, although their
mother's income of $15,500, including a rent subsidy, while higher
than the official poverty line for a single mother with two
children, puts the Pinners right at the dividing line in the Census
Bureau's experimental measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think I am richer than I am,'' said Ms. Pinner, who noted
that the gas was turned off recently when she could not pay the
bill. She also lacks money to fix her car.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Ms. Pinner said of her children, ``he wears the latest
Nike brand shoes and she the latest Levi's. I like them to look
nice, and here in the ghetto there are standards of dress. If they
don't dress up to the standards, other kids tend to pick on them. I
am not the only poor person who dresses her kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Most proposed definitions of poverty include a car _ an old one,
to be sure _ which is deemed necessary not only to get to work but
for an occasional outing, or to drive to a supermarket. ``Not
having a car is a big dividing line between the poor and the not so
poor,'' said Christopher Jencks, a sociologist at Harvard's Kennedy
School of government.
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, poor families here own used cars, but they
are often at risk. Austin Johnson, for example, says he cannot
afford car insurance. Neither can Nevada Owens, who is also short
of money to fix a flat tire. She drives her 1985 Delta Oldsmobile
with a spare doughnut tire permanently on the back rear wheel. The
car was a gift from her church, but the cost of gasoline for this
guzzler eats up 7 percent of her $17,300 in annual income.
</P>
<P>
   Her income, from welfare, food stamps, rent and tuition
subsidies and a $3,000 gift from her mother, puts Ms. Owens, a
single mother, and her three children just above the official
poverty line. But at 21, studying to be a licensed practical nurse,
she needs the car. The course work requires her to travel from her
school to two different hospitals, about 25 miles a day.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the Saturday outing in Ms. Owens' old car, which
she drives to her grandfather's home in a rural area outside the
city _ the one family luxury. ``We have a cookout,'' she said,
``and the kids play on the swings and my mother comes over _ she
lives two doors away. We have a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1993 study of impoverished single mothers, published as the
book ``Making Ends Meet,'' Kathryn Edin, a sociologist at the
University of Pennsylvania, reported that the mothers found
themselves forced to spend more than their acknowledged incomes.
They got the difference from family members, absent boyfriends,
off-the-books jobs and church charity.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one avoided the unnecessary expenditures,'' Ms. Edin said
recently, ``such as the occasional trip to the Dairy Queen, or a
pair of stylish new sneakers for the son who might otherwise sell
drugs to get them, or the cable subscription for the kids home
alone and you are afraid they will be out on the street if they are
not watching TV.''

SAM RENICK, MULTIFACETED JOCKEY, 87
</HEADLINE>

 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sam Renick, one of the country's leading jockeys half
a century ago and later a pioneer in racing television and one of
the founders of the Jockeys' Guild, died Saturday at his home in
Manhattan. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   John Giovanni, executive director of the Jockeys' Guild, said
that Renick died from complications of a severe stroke that he
suffered last winter.
</P>
<P>
   Renick became a jockey in the late 1920s when he was 16 and rode
for some of the sport's leading stables for the next 20 years. He
was a contract rider for Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt on the East Coast
and for Harry Warner on the West Coast, and he won many of the
major stakes races on both coasts.
</P>
<P>
   He was a close friend of Eddie Arcaro and other top riders, as
well as an intimate of many leaders in politics and the sporting
life, and a brother of the late Joe Renick, who also rode horses in
the middle decades of the century. After he retired, he became one
of the first television hosts of a racing program, ``Racing With
Renick,'' broadcasting from tracks in New York and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Jockeys were free agents in those days with no insurance or
medical protection, so Renick and Arcaro joined in recent years
with another celebrated rider, Johnny Longden, to form the Jockeys'
Guild. The idea, he explained, was to provide some basic protection
for jockeys and their families in case of injury or death. The
three were later honored by their fellow jockeys for their work in
organizing the guild.
</P>
<P>
   Renick, a frequent figure at New York's tracks until he was
stricken last winter, left no immediate survivors. The Jockeys'
Guild was making plans for a memorial service at Belmont Park,
where he rode many of his winners.

MORGAN STANLEY TO OFFER ONLINE TRADING TO ALL ITS CUSTOMERS
</HEADLINE>
   (ART ADV:  Graphic  is being sent to NYT graphics clients.

 By JOSEPH KAHN and PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In old-line Wall Street's latest entry into the Internet
stock-trading bazaar, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter is preparing to
introduce an overhaul of its brokerage business and to offer all
its clients the option of buying and selling stocks online at
discount prices.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, expected to be announced as early as this week, is
similar to an offering put forward in June by Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.,
the country's largest brokerage house. But Morgan Stanley hopes to
ambush Merrill by giving all its customers an online trading option
immediately, beating Merrill's planned start date by at least six
weeks, people close to Morgan Stanley said.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley already operates Discover Brokerage Direct, an
online discount broker. Its new plan envisions eliminating Discover
as a separate unit and rolling it together with traditional
brokerage services provided by Morgan Stanley's 11,000 full-service
brokers. Renamed Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Online, the electronic
service will be available either a la carte, for $29.95 a trade, or
as part of a full-service brokerage account that carries an annual
fee based on assets.
</P>
<P>
   The firm will also take a page from Charles Schwab, the leading
online broker, by converting the 450 nationwide branch offices
where its brokers work into walk-in retail centers. All its
brokerage customers will be able to deposit checks, research
stocks, get a consultation or meet with their broker, people close
to Morgan Stanley said. A spokesman for the firm declined to
comment on any aspect of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morgan Stanley thinks it is really going to be a game of
segmenting the market going forward,'' said Steve Galbraith, an
analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co., who said he had heard an
outline of the planned overhaul. ``They think you have to be able
to cater to all segments of the wallet.''
</P>
<P>
   The move marks a significant strategic shift by Morgan Stanley
that carries several risks. By offering its full-service customers
the option of trading online for a fraction of the price they pay
in commissions now, Morgan Stanley may suffer a sizable drop in the
revenue it gets from commissions, at least in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   Discover brokerage clients will also be slapped with a rare
price increase in the ultra-competitive online brokerage business,
where Discover has already been losing market share. At $29.95,
Morgan Stanley has set its new online commissions to match Schwab
and Merrill, making that the high-end benchmark. Discover Brokerage
Direct has been charging $14.95 for most stock trades, already
higher than the $5 to $8 commissions of rock-bottom online
discounters.
</P>
<P>
   People close to Morgan Stanley said that the firm expects
Discover _ famous for its get-rich-instantly ads featuring a
tow-truck driver who owns a tropical island and a schoolboy who
flies his own helicopter _ to lose some of its online customers
when it doubles the cost of trading. But they said many others
would pay the higher commissions because Morgan Stanley will now
offer them an enriched selection of its stock research and more
access to initial public offerings of issues underwritten by its
blue-chip investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will pay more, but they will get more,'' one person close
to the firm said.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley was the first traditional Wall Street firm to dip
its toes in the waters of online retail stock trading when it
bought Lombard Brokerage, a small San Francisco-based company, in
1996. But it held the operation at arm's length, naming it after
its Discover credit card and never integrating it with the firm's
much larger full-service operation. Though some Discover customers
have had access to Morgan Stanley's highly valued stock research,
for example, Morgan Stanley took its name off the research reports
and made them available online after a delay to avoid angering
full-service brokers and customers.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley spent tens of millions of dollars promoting the
Discover brokerage business on television, in print and online in
recent years. That investment seemed predicated in part on the
belief that online stock trading was a separate subset of the
brokerage business.
</P>
<P>
   Like Merrill Lynch, however, Morgan Stanley has found that
online stock trading is more fundamental than that, forcing it to
overhaul its operations sooner and more completely than its
executives had envisioned only a year ago. People close to Morgan
Stanley said that the firm was most worried about the rapid growth
of Schwab, which combines inexpensive online trading with efficient
call centers and help lines and has lured customers away from all
the major brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways Morgan Stanley's overhaul is similar to one that
Merrill announced June 1 and expects to finish introducing on Dec.
1. But Morgan Stanley is hoping to steal Merrill's thunder with its
coming announcement because it thinks it can offer all its retail
brokerage customers access to Discover's online trading platform
immediately, while Merrill promoted its plan months before it had
prepared the technology to offer the service.
</P>
<P>
   People close to Morgan Stanley also said that the firm expected
its plan would cause less internal dissent than was the case at
Merrill, where an unusually large number of brokers have defected
to rivals since the firm announced its new online trading platform
and pricing structure. The key, these people said, is that Morgan
Stanley will offer a broad array of pricing options that gives
brokers more discretion in how much they charge each customer.
</P>
<P>
   For an asset-based fee of at least $1,500 a year, Merrill Lynch
is offering unlimited trading of stocks and bonds either through
its brokers or online. Merrill also said it would introduce an
online trading service called Merrill Lynch Direct, with individual
trades for $29.95. Some Merrill brokers have rebelled because the
new pricing structure reduces how much they make from some of their
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley has addressed that issue by allowing brokers to
negotiate prices with customers who want some combination of
self-directed online trading and help from a broker. Customers who
want such a combination will be charged a percentage of the money
they invest with the firm that ranges from less than a half-percent
to 2 percent a year. The fees will vary based on the amount of
assets and the discretion of the broker involved.
</P>
<P>
   Customers who want to trade online with little or no help from a
broker will be charged $29.95 a trade. Full-service customers who
do not want to trade online will still have the option of paying
higher commissions for broker-directed trading, as they have in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley's announcement puts fresh pressure on other
full-service brokerage houses to make online trading available to
all customers who want it. But some rivals say they are not
planning to offer deeply discounted stock trading.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Salomon Smith Barney unit of Citigroup, for example, is
planning to introduce online trading by early next month. But the
service will be offered only to customers in fee-based or
traditional brokerage accounts, not at a discount.
</P>
<P>
   Another traditional brokerage firm, Paine Webber Group, is
introducing an account that allows clients who invest at least
$100,000 and pay an annual fee to make as many trades as they want,
either online or through their brokers. But Paine Webber has not
set up a separate online-trading service.
</P>
<P>
   Paine Webber executives stressed that their new account, called
Insight One, gave brokers more ``flexibility'' in pricing brokerage
services than Merrill is allowing its brokers. Donald Marron, Paine
Webber's chief executive, said the firm kept about $1 annually of
every $100 invested with it, and he did not expect that ratio to
decline because of the new account.

THE GREAT CHILDBIRTH DEBATE: DRUG-ASSISTED, OR NATURAL? 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By C.J. CHIVERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last Saturday, as a long morning of labor dragged
into afternoon, Elba Quinones soaked in a warm tub at an outpatient
birthing center in Greenwich Village, trying to ease her pain. Her
contractions came every three minutes. And when they intensified,
her screams at times became primal. Once she howled to her husband
that she couldn't take it anymore.
</P>
<P>
   An hour and a half later, after leaving the warm water, pacing,
squatting and reclining on the room's two-poster queen bed, Ms.
Quinones gave birth to Omar Rafael, her first child. She promptly
announced that she had made the right decision: to experience
childbirth naturally, without drugs _ extreme pain and all.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was better than I expected,'' she said, in her postpartum
glow. ``I am glad we chose to come here for this type of birth.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Quinones, 30, a clinical social worker who lives in
Brooklyn, is no anti-medication ideologue. She and her husband,
Alberto Toro, researched their options carefully, visiting several
hospital delivery rooms before choosing the Elizabeth Seton
Childbearing Center on West 14th Street, where the preference for
natural childbirth is a guiding philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   But by enduring labor without drugs, Ms. Quinones has placed
herself distinctly on childbearing's margins, at least among
American women. Last week, a study released by Dr. Joy Hawkins,
director of obstetric anesthesia at the University of Colorado
School of Medicine, showed that the number of women in labor who
received regional anesthesia _ spinal or epidural injections to
numb the pelvic region _ soared between 1981 and 1997. The surge,
documented by a survey of 750 hospitals, was particularly evident
in large hospitals, where the percentage of mothers receiving such
injections tripled, to 66 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hawkins attributed the increase to the ability of
anesthesiologists to ease labor pain with smaller doses of medicine
and fewer side effects than in years past.
</P>
<P>
   Although that report has not yet been presented in a
peer-reviewed paper, the news made national headlines and spread
quickly among midwives and natural-birth advocates. Of the several
dozen interviewed for this article, none doubted the report's
findings, but most voiced frustration that drug-free childbirth _
which experienced a resurgence as feminism took hold in the 1960s
and '70s _ is now being widely shunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's upsetting that it's taken such a shift, because I see
natural childbirth as such a wonderful thing to be part of,'' said
Catherine Clark, a midwife whose two children were born at home.
``The further we get away from it, the less we know ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The reaction to Dr. Hawkins' study underscored an apparently
deepening polarization among women over how childbirth should be
experienced by healthy, low-risk women.
</P>
<P>
   Even as medicated births become far more common, midwives point
out that the number of women who deliberately seek natural
childbirth has also climbed, though the rise is less sharp and the
percentage of women having such births is in only the single
digits.
</P>
<P>
   Willing to face the pain of labor, eager to avoid drugs they
worry are harmful or unnecessary, or seeking an alternative to the
impersonal care they associate with large hospitals, these women
are turning to nurse-midwives in increasing numbers. From 1989 to
1997, the number of women in the United States whose births were
attended by midwives nearly doubled, from 3.7 percent to 7 percent
of the roughly 4 million births each year, according to the
Maternity Center Association, a nonprofit organization based in
Manhattan that promotes prenatal care and education.
</P>
<P>
   While not all midwife-attended childbirths are drug-free, fewer
than one in five involves anesthesia, data provided by the
Maternity Center Association show. And midwives say the increasing
demand for their service is evidence of dissatisfaction among a
segment of women with the trend Dr. Hawkins identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``The camp that I am part of is losing this battle at this
moment,'' said Rebecca Hamilton, clinical director at the Elizabeth
Seton center. ``But I believe there is a resistance movement, in
that there is a natural movement that is going against the dominant
cultural paradigm.''
</P>
<P>
   Midwifery is especially well established in New York state,
where 10.8 percent of deliveries in 1997 were attended by certified
nurse-midwives, according to data provided by the state's
Department of Health. In New York City, the percentage reached
12.6.
</P>
<P>
   And birthing centers in the city, both free-standing and in
hospitals, report delivering more babies than in years past. The
Elizabeth Seton center, which is affiliated with St. Vincent's
Hospital and Medical Center two blocks away, projects 316 births
this year, up from 205 in 1998; in May the 20-month-old birth
center at Bellevue Hospital Center had its busiest month ever,
delivering 41 babies.
</P>
<P>
   Among the new mothers who have created these increases, the
decision to avoid anesthesia is rooted in many strongly held
convictions. For some, it is an extension of strong feminist
beliefs and an urge to experience what they say is the most
profound physical experience of a woman's life. ``It's just a
remarkable rite of passage,'' Ms. Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   The transforming experience of childbirth, these women say, is
compromised by pain-numbing drugs and the medical equipment that
accompanies them. Anesthesia, for instance, typically requires a
woman in labor to be connected to a fetal monitor, an intravenous
tube, a blood pressure cuff and perhaps a pulse monitor and urinary
catheter. The drugs and the equipment reduce mobility and can bring
a degree of discomfort, some natural-birth advocates said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a much greater fear of having a needle stuck in my
spinal area, and being strapped to all these monitors, than I did
about having to worry about enduring pain my body is made to
handle,'' said Bridget Goodbody, 36, who gave birth naturally to
her first child, Abigail Zoe, on July 4.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For others, the decision to avoid anesthesia has cultural roots.
This is particularly evident in some immigrant communities, where
families come from countries where hospital-based births are
unusual, and epidural anesthesia all but unheard of. At the
Bellevue Birth Center, roughly half of the women choosing midwives
are of Asian descent, and perhaps another third are Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these women come from countries where they are just
not used to the idea of having medicated births,'' said Karen
Baldwin, the center's director of midwifery services.
</P>
<P>
   Other women worry that mothers who opt for anesthesia are
compromising a baby's alertness and ability to breast-feed during
the first days after birth, although the topic has been scarcely
studied. ``If you go to lactation conferences, you'll find that
almost all lactation consultants believe there is a direct
correlation between having an epidural and poor and disorganized
suck reflexes among newborns,'' said Jan Wenk, a certified
lactation consultant.
</P>
<P>
   And some midwives also said the increase in epidurals means
women have less chance to enjoy the intimate participation of
family and friends during delivery. While many hospital delivery
rooms allow a limited number of guests during a physician-attended
birth, midwives strive for a more inclusive approach than drug-free
delivery can allow.
</P>
<P>
   Jeannine McCullagh, 69, said her daughter, Kathleen, had a
natural childbirth in July that allowed her family to bond in a way
that would be impossible in a medicated birth.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years ago, Jeannine McCullagh gave birth to Kathleen after
24 hours of labor. She was separated from her husband and numbed at
the waist by spinal anesthesia. She remembers seeing her newborn
daughter briefly. Then she fell asleep.
</P>
<P>
   This July, when Kathleen McCullagh gave birth to her first
child, Jeannine was with her in the birthing center. Kathleen
delivered in the shower, hot water splashing on her back. Jeannine
cut the umbilical cord. Everybody was touching one another. ``When
I got home to tell my husband about it, all I could do was cry,''
Ms. McCullagh said last week. ``We just didn't have these kinds of
experiences in my time, before the women's movement changed
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Dr. Hawkins' study illustrated, women who strive for a
drug-free delivery remain a decided minority. And some natural
birth advocates say they understand why other women opt for
anesthesia, even if they shun it for themselves. ``As soon as my
contractions started, I was like, `Oh, I get it,''' Ms. Goodbody
said. ``The pain was intense.''
</P>
<P>
   They also say that a natural childbirth is not an option for a
variety of mothers with risk factors, including premature labor, a
history of health problems or a fetus with abnormal heart tones.
</P>
<P>
   But natural childbirth advocates also worry that Dr. Hawkins'
study suggests that many women are choosing drugs before reviewing
their options, and examining the possible side effects of
anesthesia, including headaches, disorientation, slowed labor,
fever and backache.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more women are just saying, `Oh, I'll have an
epidural,''' said Joan Liebmann-Smith, assistant executive director
of the Maternity Center Association. ``They make this decision
ahead of time, without really considering the risks and benefits of
it. I think that's very odd.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Birnbach, director of obstetric anesthesiology at St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center on the Upper West Side, said
worries about medicated pain relief are often overstated, in part
because some are based on data culled from days when
anesthesiologists applied larger doses. Some midwives, he said, are
scaring patients unnecessarily.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 90 percent of the women giving birth in delivery rooms
at St. Luke's have epidurals, he said, and he sees high
satisfaction and few side effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The midwifery point of view is the point of view of a vocal
minority, not the dominant point of view of women in America,''
Birnbach said, and added that though natural births are on the rise
in a small segment of the population, Dr. Hawkins' study shows that
``the vocal minority,'' for the moment, has lost the middle.

VERNON DE TAR, 94, ORGANIST INFLUENTIAL IN CHURCH MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., N.Y.)  (js) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vernon de Tar, the organist and choirmaster at the Episcopal
Church of the Ascension in Greenwich Village for 42 years and a
teacher at the Union Theological Seminary, Yale University and the
Juilliard School, died on Oct. 7 in Kennett Square, Pa., where he
lived. He was 94.
</P>
<P>
   De Tar was an important figure in American church music, having
taught several generations of organists and having made a forceful
case for replacing lugubrious 19th-century hymns with more
contemporary settings as well as works from the 16th century that
had fallen out of use. While at the Church of the Ascension he
commissioned and performed several new works.
</P>
<P>
   At his retirement concert in 1981 he led a program of works for
choir, brass, timpani, harp and organ that included the premieres
of Louie White's ``Sursum cofrda'' and Alan Fletcher's setting of
Psalm 26. De Tar's ``O'er the Cradle'' is occasionally heard in
Christmas programs.
</P>
<P>
   De Tar was born in Detroit and studied the piano and organ at
Syracuse University, from which he graduated in 1927. He continued
his studies in New York with Franklin Cannon, David McK. Williams
and Fernando Germani before returning to Michigan to earn his
doctorate in music at Albion College. He also received a doctorate
in sacred music at the Church Divinity School of the Pacific in
Berkeley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   In 1932, soon after he returned to New York, de Tar was
appointed organist and choirmaster at the Calvary Episcopal Church,
where he worked until taking up the same positions at the Church of
the Ascension in 1939. While there he oversaw the design and
installation of a Holtkamp organ and established a performance
program that brought the church its reputation as a place for
varied programs of sacred music from the Renaissance to the
present.
</P>
<P>
   He also established a series of art-song recitals at the church.
During the Iranian hostage crisis de Tar played a daily program on
the church's carillon.
</P>
<P>
   De Tar taught organ and church music at the Juilliard School
from 1947 to 1982, the School of Sacred Music at the Union
Theological Seminary from 1945 to 1972 and the Institute of Sacred
Music at Yale University from 1975 to 1978. He was also a member of
the National Council of the American Guild of Organists, the
Association of Anglican Musicians, the Hymn Society of America and
of the boards of several church music organizations.
</P>
<P>
   After his retirement from the Church of the Ascension, de Tar
worked as a substitute organist at several churches in Pennsylvania
and continued to teach privately.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a daughter, Nina A. Fuller of Riverside,
Texas, three grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

LEE LOZANO, 68, CONCEPTUAL ARTIST WHO STOPPED TALKING TO WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, N.Y.)  (js) 
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lee Lozano, an eccentric artist who pursued Conceptual Art and
painting in the 1960s and then left the New York art world for
self-imposed exile that included an embargo on contact with other
women, died on Oct. 2 in the Dallas Health and Rehabilitation
Center in Texas. She was 68 and lived in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cervical cancer, said Mark Kramer, the artist's
cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lozano was a quixotic, confounding rebel whose decadelong
New York career seemed always to involve pushing one limit or
another. Her early paintings, executed in an Expressionistic
cartoon style, confronted issues of sexual and painterly decorum.
They featured a robust messiness, distorted close-ups of the body,
intimations of violence and suggestively exaggerated images of
tools.
</P>
<P>
   By 1967 she had taken the systemic approach of Minimalism,
making nearly monochromatic ``Wave'' paintings based on wavelengths
that pushed the limits of visual perception. In the mid-1960s she
also began to execute a series of life-related actions (she didn't
like the word performance) that tested, among other things, her
stamina, her friends' patience and the conduct of everyday life.
These works reflected her friendship with Conceptually inclined
artists like Sol LeWitt, Hollis Frampton, Dan Graham and Carl Andre
. They also reflected an increasing disenchantment with the art
world that bordered on hostility.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these pieces were proposed or recorded in written works
that she considered drawings. Sometimes she designated everyday
activities like thought, conversation or marijuana smoking as art,
attracted by the idea that they were unsaleable and democratic. Her
``Throw-Up Piece'' proposed throwing the 10 most recent issues of
Artforum, the leading magazine of contemporary art, in the air and
letting them fall where they may. In ``Transistor Radio Piece'' she
listened to a radio while attending a panel discussion on art.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969 and 1970, Ms. Lozano began a steady withdrawal from the
art world in works that she titled ``General Strike Piece'' and
``Dropout Piece.'' She decided to boycott women for a month or two
as a means of improving communication with them. For unexplained
reasons, she continued this piece to the end of her life, despite
the great inconvenience and, one supposes, even greater rudeness.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lozano was born Lee Knastner in Newark in 1930. She received
a B.A. from the University of Chicago in 1951 and studied painting
at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. In the late 1950s
she was married briefly to an architect, Adrian Lozano. She had her
first exhibition at the Bianchini Gallery in New York in 1966 and
was then associated with the Green Gallery. In 1998 her work, long
absent from the New York scene, returned when three SoHo galleries,
Mitchell Algus, Rosen &AMP; van Liere and Margarete Roeder, each showed
a different phase of her painting. At the same time the Wadsworth
Atheneum in Hartford exhibited her ``Wave'' paintings and
notebooks. All the dealers and curators involved with these
exhibitions were men.

ELLA MAE MORSE, 75, VOCALIST WHO TRANSCENDED POP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Texas)  (lb) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ella Mae Morse, the sultry, swinging pop-jazz singer whose 1942
hit, ``Cow-Cow Boogie,'' became the first million seller for the
fledgling Capitol Records and helped establish the label, died on
Saturday at the Western Arizona Regional Medical Center in Bullhead
City. She was 75 and lived in Bullhead City.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was respiratory failure, said her press agent, Alan
Eichler.
</P>
<P>
   A true original, Ms. Morse belted an exuberant mixture of
boogie-woogie, blues, jazz, swing and country that transcended
genres.
</P>
<P>
   Her 1946 recording of ``House of Blue Lights'' is considered
influential in the evolution of rock 'n' roll. Among her other hits
were ``Shoo-Shoo Baby,'' ``Mister Five by Five,'' ``No Love, No
Nothin','' ``Milkman, Keep Those Bottles Quiet,'' ``The Patty-Cake
Man'' and her million-selling 1952 comeback hit, ``The Blacksmith
Blues.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Morse was born in 1924 in Mansfield, Texas. Her father,
George Morse, a drummer from England, led a small dance band, and
her mother, Ann, a native Texan, played ragtime and Dixieland
piano. By age 9, Ms. Morse was singing with her father's band in
nightclubs. When the family moved to Paris, Texas, she became a
friend of an elderly black guitar player who taught her the blues
and became a major influence on her style.
</P>
<P>
   At 13 (but claiming to be 19), Ms. Morse auditioned for Jimmy
Dorsey's band in Dallas. She won the job, but had to quit when her
charade was discovered. Moving to San Diego, she was reunited with
Freddie Slack, Dorsey's pianist, who had quit the band to strike
out on his own as a leader.
</P>
<P>
   He hired her to be his vocalist just as the band was signed by
Johnny Mercer and Glenn Wallichs to be the first artists on their
new label, Capitol Records. Their first recording, ``Cow-Cow
Boogie,'' was a novelty song.
</P>
<P>
   After the song leaped to the top of the pop charts, Ms. Morse
was signed to Capitol as a soloist and remained there for the next
15 years. Many of her hits were even more in the rhythm-and-blues
than in the pop market, and many fans didn't know whether she was
black or white. (She was white.) In 1946 she reunited with Slack to
record the seminal ``House of Blue Lights.''
</P>
<P>
   After taking several years off to start a family, Ms. Morse
returned to Capitol studios in 1952 to record ``The Blacksmith
Blues.'' Although she stopped recording in 1957, she continued to
make occasional appearances, including a 1970s tour with Carter's
band and an annual engagement at Disneyland with Ray McKinley's
band.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984 she made a series of club appearances in Los Angeles,
and in 1987 she appeared at Michael's Pub in New York. Two years
ago her complete body of work was released in a five-CD box set by
Bear Family Records.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her husband, Jack Bradford; their children,
Dan and Laura; and four children from previous marriages _ Richard,
Marcia, Ann and Kenny; as well as eight grandchildren and three
great-grandchildren.

COMMENTARY: BEWARE OF SPIES WHO THINK THEY CAN BE SMART VENTURE

<P>
   The CIA Agency has worn many disguises and operated countless
front companies, but until now it has never established a Silicon
Valley venture capital firm. The decision to set up the nonprofit
investment company, named In-Q-It, is outlandish. Maybe the Federal
Bureau of Investigation would like to get into the banking business
or the Secret Service would like to spin off a subsidiary that
provides personal security for celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   But at least credit the CIA for creative thinking, and for
trying to revive a long and often successful tradition of
encouraging new technology. Though the agency is better known for
running covert operations and producing intelligence estimates,
sometimes to its discredit, the CIA over the decades has quietly
been a pioneer in aerospace and electronics. I have been reviewing
that history in recent months, and find several models that might
serve the agency well as it seeks to stimulate the production of
computer hardware and software that can help it absorb and analyze
a daily tidal wave of intelligence information.
</P>
<P>
   Much about the old ways of doing business would be unacceptable
today. When the agency set out in 1954 to build the U-2 spy plane,
it drew money from the CIA director's contingency account and sent
a check to the home of the plane's chief designer, Kelly Johnson,
who worked for Lockheed. He moved the money through a fake company
and Lockheed employees assigned to the project traveled under
fictitious names. Congress knew almost nothing about the whole
enterprise. Equally stringent secrecy was employed a few years
later when the agency set out to produce the first photo
reconnaissance satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Such clandestine practices are unnecessary for the kind of
computer advances the CIA now seeks to develop, something the
agency recognizes in openly establishing In-Q-It. But the
pioneering spirit and effective leadership that characterized early
Cold War projects would be useful today. Richard Bissell, best
known for his direction of the failed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba
in 1961, was a skillful manager of technology projects for the CIA
during the Eisenhower administration. He delegated authority,
encouraged innovation and suppressed bureaucracy, habits that are
in short supply in Washington today. The U-2, which required
numerous innovations in aircraft design, fuel chemistry and camera
technology, was ready for operation ahead of schedule and under
budget.
</P>
<P>
   These projects also inspired a level of collaboration between
the government, scientists and private companies that would be good
_ if difficult _ to duplicate today. A common desire to enhance
American security encouraged this kind of cooperation, as did the
example of similar work in World War II. The Vietnam War left many
scientists understandably wary of defense projects, and the allure
of making millions in cyber enterprises keeps many of the most
imaginative computer engineers and software designers from working
on government contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge facing the CIA is to find a way to encourage the
invention of new computer technologies without imagining that it
can create a nimble venture capital firm. Investing public funds in
fledgling, high-risk companies is not a sound use of federal
dollars. Even if potential losses can be limited, the CIA, with its
reflexive preference for secrecy, ought not to be subsidizing a
venture capital company in the freewheeling entrepreneurial world
of Silicon Valley. In a democracy, intelligence agencies should not
be independent operators in the private sector, even through the
use of an outside board of directors, the case with In-Q-It.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the nature of technological innovation and the
government's role in supporting it has changed substantially since
the 1950s. Especially in the rapidly advancing frontiers of
computer science, the private sector has so outdistanced the
government that military and intelligence agencies are now largely
dependent on research breakthroughs that are beyond their ability
to direct or to control. In theory, the inventive culture of
Silicon Valley is so fluid and serendipitous that the traditional
Washington practice of paying a specific company to produce a
particular product is unlikely to yield the kind of technology the
CIA seeks.
</P>
<P>
   That does not leave the CIA helpless. Instead of relying on its
venture capital company, the CIA should closely track advances in
the computer field. When potentially beneficial ideas are spotted,
the agency can invest in their development by contracting with the
companies involved. This would still give the agency a chance to
encourage innovation at an early stage. Such an approach would
require more supple procurement procedures, something that the
agency and Congress ought to be able to devise.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to take today's lumbering federal agencies and
turn them into engines of innovation. But the challenge the CIA has
identified _ making more rapid use of new technologies _ is
critical to the effectiveness of the nation's intelligence and
defense agencies. Putting the CIA in the venture capital business
is not the answer. But the impulse to step outside bureaucratic
conventions is right. The agency might find some helpful ideas in
its own accomplishments a generation ago.

CSUN TO FACE ANOTHER ROAD TEST IN MONTANA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was the comeback game of the season. Or was it
a mirage?
</P>
<P>
   Now comes a real test for the Cal State Northridge football
team.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors, who soundly beat Sacramento State 36-14 Saturday
afternoon at North Campus Stadium, make their second trip in three
weeks to the state of Montana this Saturday, this time facing
Montana State in Bozeman.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN is 3-3, with all three wins coming at home. An 8-year-old
can figure out Northridge's record on the road this season. The
coaches and players need look no further than Sacramento State to
see what separates a contender for the Big Sky Conference
championship from the champion.
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets, who were ranked No. 23 in Division I-AA by The
Sports Network, haven't won a game away from home this season. In
two Big Sky road games, CSUN has lost concentration and played
catch-up in losses at Eastern Washington and Montana.
</P>
<P>
   ``No team other than Kansas has completely knocked us off the
ball and hurt us,'' CSUN interim head coach Jeff Kearin said after
Saturday's game. ``We played at a high level the whole game
(against the Hornets), which is something we haven't done this
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Three factors worked in CSUN's favor. The Matadors excelled in
these key areas:
</P>
<P>
   __ Time of possession.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors, who had a season-high 43 rushing attempts, had the
ball almost 10 full minutes more than Sacramento State, including a
significant advantage in the fourth quarter _ thanks to a 16-play,
77-yard drive that took 7 minutes, 16 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Easily the longest drive in terms of time this season, it could
have been one of the longest since the school went to the
run-and-shoot offense five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best defense is a good offense,'' Kearin said, ``to keep
that guy off the field.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That guy'' is Sacramento State running back Charles Roberts,
the nation's leading rusher entering the game. By controlling the
clock, the Matadors didn't allow Roberts and the Hornets to get
into rhythm on offense.
</P>
<P>
   __ The time-of-possession disparity didn't suddenly make the
Hornets offensively clueless. Sacramento State entered averaging 43
points per game and was able to shock CSUN temporarily with a
91-yard touchdown pass from Ricky Ray to Lamont Webb in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   That play was a blip on the radar screen, though, in proportion
to how the Matadors' defensive performed. The importance of
tackling, lost on some of the CSUN players prior to this week, was
crucial against Roberts, who rarely made a defender miss.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator Foster Andersen should clip and save the
video of some of the tackles on Roberts for future use.
</P>
<P>
   __ Most important, CSUN started quickly, taking a 17-0 lead in
the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time the Matadors had led by so much so early,
and the effects were easy to see. CSUN quarterback Marcus Brady
said he was relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't put pressure on us,'' Brady said, about dominating
the first quarter, ``where we had to go out and score every
time.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
CSUN STATUS REPORT &QL; 
GAME: 6 &QL; 
RESULT: CSUN 36, Sacramento State 14 &QL; 
THIS WEEK'S GPA: 3.4 &QL; 
CUMULATIVE GPA: 2.62 &QL; 
NEXT GAME: at Montana State &QL; 
QUARTERBACKS &QL; 
Returning to the form that has made him so successful in just 1{
seasons as the starter, Marcus Brady threw 39 passes without an
interception. His completion percentage _ 72 percent _ was his
second-best this season but not by much. &QL; 
A &QL; 
RUNNING BACKS &QL; 
Statistic of the day: Jaumal Bradley has set a career-best rushing
total in each of the four games he's played this year. He had 132
yards on 30 carries against Sac State. As a team, CSUN had 43
carries, the most in recent memory. &QL; 
B+ &QL; 
RECEIVERS &QL; 
Responded _ emphatically _ after poor game the week before. Had
only a few drops and only mistake was Terrence Jones' personal foul
for taunting a defender on his way into end zone on 74-yard TD
pass. &QL; 
A &QL; 
OFFENSIVE LINE &QL; 
Sac State was second in Big Sky in rushing defense, but this unit
stepped up and helped Matadors control the clock. Brady was rarely
pressured, and sacked just twice _ after two starters went out with
injuries. &QL; 
B &QL; 
DEFENSIVE LINE &QL; 
Set tone early by pressuring QB Ricky Ray on two of Hornets' first
three plays. CSUN was supposed to be dominated by Sac State's
massive offensive line, but that didn't happen. &QL; 
B+ &QL; 
LINEBACKERS &QL; 
Brennen Swanson is back. The Buchanan Award candidate had two sacks
and had first-contact on Charles Roberts several times. Lewis
Blanton had his best game of season (four tackles), but Cos
Abercrombie was so-so. &QL; 
B- &QL; 
DEFENSIVE BACKS &QL; 
The most prominent heroes of a defensive effort that erased some
memories of early-season collapses. Rahman Sparks, Steve Forte and
Chazz Moore combined for 26 tackles and Forte and Mel Miller had
INTs. They need to preserve this performance in a time capsule. &QL; 
A &QL; 
SPECIAL TEAMS &QL; 
Weren't really much of a factor while the rest of the team
dominated. Had two extra-point attempts blocked and Hornets
averaged 25 yards per kickoff return. No costly mistakes, though. &QL; 
C+ &QL; 
COACHING &QL; 
Defensive coordinator Foster Andersen gets most of the credit, but
he would agree the players finally played to their abilities.
Played up the revenge factor well in practice without sounding
corny. &QL;

EDITORIAL: A FOREST LEGACY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Oct. 18:
</P>
<P>
   If he were to walk away from the conservation issue right now,
President Clinton would already have achieved a respectable legacy,
including his considerable efforts to restore the Everglades,
preserve Utah's Red Rock wilderness, save California's redwoods and
protect Yellowstone National Park from destructive mining. But in
terms of scope and political audacity, nothing quite matches the
proposal he announced last week to protect more than 40 million
acres of national forest from commercial development. If his scheme
survives legal and congressional challenges, no sure thing, it will
almost surely be recorded as a signature environmental achievement
of his administration.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, Clinton's announcement could not have been more
timely. Even as he spoke, a House-Senate conference committee was
finishing work on an Interior Department appropriations bill that
reduces by two-thirds his modest $495 million open-space request
for the current fiscal year, threatening not only the Everglades
program but wilderness initiatives from California to New England.
The bill, which Clinton has rightly threatened to veto, also
includes a half-dozen anti-environmental riders. Clinton's forest
proposal is bold enough in its own right. Set against the
stinginess of this Congress, it is positively breathtaking.
</P>
<P>
   The president's proposal would not actually expand the national
forests, which cover 192 million acres. Of these, 34 million acres
have already been designated as protected wilderness by Congress,
and thus placed off limits to logging, mining and other forms of
development. What the proposal would do is create an additional 40
million acres of near-wilderness _ areas with only slightly less
protection than congressionally designated wilderness _ by
preventing roads from being built in those parts of the national
forests that do not have them now. Without roads, commercial
development is virtually impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The tactical genius of the plan is that it can be done
administratively, under the National Forest Management Act, thus
circumnavigating a potentially hostile Congress. Congress may try
to cause mischief along the way with legislative maneuvers designed
to delay or derail the plan. But Clinton has a far better chance
this way than if he had simply asked the Republicans to give him 40
million acres of new wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is also designed to survive the vagaries of
presidential politics. The entire process of public comment,
hearings and the writing of new regulations could last until until
next December, after the election but before before Clinton leaves
office. At that point, a final rule will be issued making the 40
million acres off limits to roads. Under the law, a new president
would have to go through the same laborious public process to undo
the plan. That could prove to be politically impossible, given
strong public sentiment in favor of protecting public lands.
</P>
<P>
   This plan is the culmination of a long effort by James Lyons,
the under secretary of agriculture for natural resources, Mike
Dombeck, the Forest Service chief, and George Frampton, the
president's chief environmental adviser, to impress upon Congress
and indeed the Forest Service itself the notion that the national
forests are more than tree farms. The plan's most glaring flaw is
that it does not include the Tongass National Forest, which
Alaska's powerful congressional delegation _ which effectively
controls the Forest Service's budget _ is determined to keep open
for logging. However, the Tongass is not explicitly excluded, and
in the end its 2 million roadless acres could be added. That would
make a very good plan even better.

EDITORIAL: NIGERIA'S PROMISING START 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Oct. 18:
</P>
<P>
   When former Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo was inaugurated as president
of Nigeria in late May, he took over a once-prosperous nation that
had been reduced to misery by a series of larcenous military
regimes. In the late 1970s, Obasanjo was himself Nigeria's military
ruler, although the first to turn over power to a civilian. In
1995, Gen. Sani Abacha, the country's most ruthless leader, jailed
Obasanjo for three years. But he remained close to the military and
won elections this year bankrolled by some of Nigeria's most
nefarious officers. There was reason for skepticism about his
intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Obasanjo _ who is to receive Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright later this week _ has won over many of his
critics, distancing himself from his former military allies, taking
important steps to combat corruption and restoring political
freedoms. He is now beginning economic reforms. With one important
exception _ the troubles of the oil-producing Delta region _
Obasanjo has awakened hopes that Nigeria's slide can be halted or
reversed.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Obasanjo's actions are not only symbolically important
but can also reduce the chance of yet another military coup. On
June 10 he fired 93 high-ranking officers, including all who
recently occupied political posts. Obasanjo also canceled all
contracts awarded by the military government in 1999, which saw
billions of dollars in sweetheart deals. He has established three
commissions to investigate corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria is freer than it has been in years. A bustling civil
society operates without fear, and unions are regaining influence.
A new commission that will hold hearings and collect reports on
serious human rights abuses has only limited powers, but it is led
by respected activists.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo's efforts to revive the economy have been blessed by a
sharp rise in the price of what is virtually the country's only
product, oil. He has chosen a capable economic team, which has
begun to reverse Nigeria's pariah status with international
lenders. His most visible and popular achievement to date has been
to end an absurd gasoline shortage that kept drivers waiting in
line, sometimes overnight, for expensive gas.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage was caused by corrupt manipulation of oil supplies.
Fighting corruption is Obasanjo's most important and difficult
challenge. State treasuries are so looted that many cannot pay
$20-a-month teacher's salaries. Obasanjo has proposed an
anti-corruption bill and measures to cut middlemen out of state
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   But Obasanjo, sadly, has shown little interest in one necessary
measure to combat corruption and several other problems, including
a new relationship between Nigeria's states and its central
government, which controls most of the country's revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is seen most dramatically in the Niger Delta. Oil
money goes to the central government, where it disappears. The
oil-producing Delta gets virtually nothing back to alleviate
desperate poverty or clean up environmental destruction. This has
radicalized many in the Delta. Youth gangs have kidnaped oil
workers and sabotaged production, which has cost Nigeria billions
of dollars. Security forces have responded with hundreds of
killings.
</P>
<P>
   In early June, Obasanjo met with Delta community leaders. But
his conduct and his proposals show that he sees the region mainly
as a security problem. Without more local say over oil money and
how it is spent, the Delta could explode. Obasanjo's greatest
contribution to Nigeria's stability may eventually be his
willingness to reduce his own powers.

JIM JENSEN, NEW YORK CITY NEWS ANCHOR, IS DEAD AT 73
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., Mass., Colo.)  (rk) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jim Jensen, a gravelly voiced and popular WCBS news
anchor and news reporter who was a major figure in New York
television for years, died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital. He
was 73 and lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was apparently a heart attack, said former colleagues
of his at WCBS.
</P>
<P>
   Jensen was with WCBS from 1964 to 1995. Accounts have differed
as to why he left then, but it has been suggested that his contract
was not renewed.
</P>
<P>
   He was a news anchor for most of his years with WCBS. He lost
his anchor job briefly in the 1980s but came back in that capacity
in the 1990s. For some years during his tenure at WCBS-TV, it had
the most-watched newscasts in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Broad-shouldered and rugged-looking, he was sometimes said to
look like actor Jack Palance. On screen, he had an ``aura of, `I'm
telling it like it is. This is what happened,''' a former
co-worker, Chris Borgen, recalled. ``You really believed him. He
was like Walter Cronkite.''
</P>
<P>
   After the terrorist bombing at the World Trade Center in 1993,
Jensen, who was anchoring that coverage, tried in a conversation on
the air to reassure a worker who was trapped on the 107th floor. No
emergency worker had yet visited that floor.
</P>
<P>
   With a trembling voice, the worker, Scott Salem, said that the
smoke in his office was growing worse, and that the people trapped
with him, particularly a pregnant woman who was having difficulty
breathing, were becoming more anxious.
</P>
<P>
   Jensen instructed him, on the air, ``Tell them to calm down,''
and said, ``We're going to try to get help to you.''
</P>
<P>
   WCBS became flooded with calls from people trapped inside the
building who were apparently watching the broadcast on
battery-operated television sets. The station's general manager,
Bud Carey, said later that WCBS had been in the position of ``being
part of the story and trying to report the story,'' and that its
staff ``tried to connect people with the Fire Department and the
police.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, WCBS reported that Jensen, having been the anchor for
Channel 2 News for 18 years, had become ``New York's
longest-running anchorman.'' At that time, he had been the anchor
for ``Channel 2 News at Six'' since soon after he joined WCBS, and
he had been the anchor for ``Channel 2 News at Eleven'' for seven
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consistency is the key word; you can't rely on gimmickry or
you don't last long,'' Jensen said at that time. ``You just do your
job.''
</P>
<P>
   He also relished going out and covering the news. He reported on
Robert F. Kennedy's 1964 campaign for the Senate and on the racial
unrest in the long, hot summers in the 1960s. He repeatedly visited
the Middle East and came to be recognized when he walked the
streets of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the strength Jensen exuded, he had trouble with
depression and with substance abuse. In the realm of
substance-abuse treatment, his example also commanded a large
audience. In 1990, WCBS broadcast some program segments about
treatment he had undergone for addiction to alcohol and Valium.
When, at that time, the station broadcast the number of the
toll-free phone line of the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug
Dependence, the council's operators received more than 1,000 calls
from the metropolitan region over five days.
</P>
<P>
   Jensen, who was of Danish descent, was born in Kenosha, Wis.,
and received a bachelor's degree in broadcast journalism from the
University of Denver. He worked in radio broadcasting and went on
to join WBZ-TV in Boston, where he did news broadcasts and special
reports, including one called ``Assignment _ Prison.''
</P>
<P>
   The prominent people he interviewed over the years included
Jimmy Hoffa, Fidel Castro, Moshe Dayan and King Hussein of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Among the honors he won were Emmy Awards and the New York State
Associated Press Broadcasters Association Award.
</P>
<P>
   His son Randall died in 1979 in a hang glider accident near
Ellenville in Ulster County, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Jensen's marriage to his first wife, Gerda, ended in
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Rachel Gordon Jensen, two daughters
and a son.
</P>
<P>
   After his death, his wife said he was ``so sweet and kind; he
was at times a difficult person, but he was worth it.'' &QL;

COMMENTARY: KEEPING THE FAITH  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind.)  (js) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The dominant religion in Indiana for most of this century has
been basketball. The houses of worship more often than not were
funky, rundown arenas that offered the faithful a rocking, roaring
escape from the hard life and cold nights in places like Muncie and
Fort Wayne and French Lick and Logootee.
</P>
<P>
   So much of professional basketball as we know it today was
forged in the rituals of those nights. The names float easily to
the surface. John Wooten, Larry Bird, Oscar Robertson, Isiah
Thomas, Walt Bellamy, Rick Mount, Bobby Knight, Reggie Miller . . .
</P>
<P>
   A team coached by a man named Marvin Wood became the national
symbol of the Indiana basketball experience. Wood, who died last
week at the age of 71, was the coach of the high school team from
tiny Milan, Ind., that won the 1954 state championship when it
defeated mighty Muncie Central High School in a thriller, 32-30.
Milan's improbable journey to a championship was portrayed in the
1986 movie ``Hoosiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week I talked to one of the greatest (some say the
greatest) of all the players to go through the Indiana experience,
Oscar Robertson. He grew up in Indianapolis and went to the
all-black Crispus Attucks High School. For many years Catholic
schools and black schools were banned from the state tournament,
but that had changed by the mid-'50s. Young Robertson and his
Crispus Attucks teammates were virtually unstoppable. They won a
combined 62 games against only one loss in 1955 and 1956. The team
won the state championship both years, and during one stretch it
won a record 45 games in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson is 60 now and not nearly as well known as his
extraordinary achievements in high school, college and professional
basketball might indicate. He said he is in good health (he donated
a kidney to his daughter a couple of years ago) but would like to
lose a few pounds. I had called him to ask how he felt about the
way basketball has changed over the past half century.
</P>
<P>
   He immediately lamented the commercialization. ``If you look at
basketball today, everything is marketing,'' he said. ``Even as
great as Michael Jordan was on the court, he was more popular off
the court.''
</P>
<P>
   And while some people can handle an over-emphasis on money and
marketing, he said, there are many who cannot. ``I feel there are
guys today who don't really care whether they win or not,'' he
said. ``And I think management often doesn't care, as long as they
can market their product and make the money.''
</P>
<P>
   His concern was ironic because as the president of the Players
Association Robertson led a court fight that paved the way to free
agency and much higher player salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money changes people,'' said Robertson, whose first pro
contract, in 1960, was for $33,000 a year. ``I don't mean that as a
criticism; that's just the way it is. I'm glad the players are
making more money now because I think it will help their families
in the long run. I think it's great to have the opportunity to make
the money they're making. But it does change people.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Basketball Association, like most of this society,
is indeed obsessed with marketing. It is trying at the moment to
adjust to the post-Michael Jordan era. Five new arenas are opening
this season, including a new home in Indianapolis for the Indiana
Pacers. If you want to get a sense of the extent to which the sport
itself has been overshadowed by marketing considerations, consider
that the Pacers' new arena, the Conseco Fieldhouse, is the only one
of the five that scheduled a basketball game as its opening
attraction.
</P>
<P>
   A Celine Dion concert opened the Pepsi Center, home of the
Denver Nuggets. Bruce Springsteen opened the Staples Center, home
of the Lakers and the Clippers in Los Angeles. The country singer
Vince Gill opened the Philips Arena in Atlanta. And Gloria Estefan
will do the honors at the American Airlines Arena in Miami on New
Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   At least it's still largely about basketball in Indiana. The
Conseco Fieldhouse (yes, they're all named after corporations) has
been designed to evoke memories of those ancient arenas that
nurtured the true faith for so many fans over so many decades. It
opens early next month with a ceremony honoring the 50 greatest
players in the state's history, and a game between the Pacers and
Boston Celtics.

BRUINS' HOPES FADING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA's Rose Bowl chase ended at Arizona State. Its
Holiday Bowl hopes probably disappeared Saturday afternoon in a
17-0 loss to California. An El Paso New Year's Eve seems remote,
which leaves Christmas in Hawaii and not much else.
</P>
<P>
   The postseason possibilities are dwindling by the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather go to Hawaii than El Paso anyhow,'' one player
said.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the Bruins (3-4, 1-3) are in the bowl picture until
their sixth defeat. Based on Saturday's performance, that could
come in two weeks _ after a trip to Oregon State and a visit by
Arizona. Yes, the two-time defending Pac-10 champs could be
eliminated from bowl contention before November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't go to a bowl my freshman year (1996) and I definitely
want to go to a bowl game as a senior,'' fullback Durell Price
said. ``For this to happen is uncalled for. Everybody has to check
what's in their gut for the rest of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   If they check the Pac-10 bowl contracts, here's what they'll
find:
</P>
<P>
   __ The second-place team goes to San Diego for the Dec. 29
Holiday Bowl against the Big 12's third-place finisher.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have one chance for second, but it's microscopic:
They must win their remaining games (unlikely but possible) and
hope several teams collapse. If UCLA somehow climbs into a
second-place tie, its name value and fast finish could entice the
Holiday brass. But don't count on it.
</P>
<P>
   __ The Pac-10 ships its third-place team to El Paso for the Dec.
31 Sun Bowl against the Big Ten's fifth-place finisher.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the Bruins need to win out for a chance. Since the league
expanded to 10 teams in 1978, no 4-4 team has finished higher than
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   __ The fourth- and fifth-place teams head to Hawaii for the
Aloha and O'ahu Bowls on Christmas Day. (Bowl officials determine
which teams play in which games.)
</P>
<P>
   Because of distance and the Christmas kickoff, the Hawaii games
depend on television ratings, not ticket sales. That makes UCLA an
ideal participant. All the Bruins have to do is win three of their
last four.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they could lose three of four. Or they could win all
four. Or lose all four. After seven games, the Bruins are as
unpredictable as they were Sept. 1. Their performance varies not
from week to week but from play to play.
</P>
<P>
   That's not surprising for a young team, especially a young team
with injuries and a rookie quarterback. Of the 44 players on the
two-deep, only 11 are seniors.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday, for the first time since a Nov. '96 trip to
Washington, the Bruins were manhandled at the line of scrimmage _
and that irked them more than the final score.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I'm (angry),'' Price said. ``We take pride in being
tougher than our opponents. When a team shows it's tougher than
you, it (makes you angry).
</P>
<P>
   ``I brought my lunch pail for the game _ that's what I was
gearing myself up for. We knew we'd have to bring our hard hats and
lunch pails and maybe even call out for dinner, because it was
going to be a long, tough game. We knew that. We didn't respond.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
UCLA STATUS REPORT &QL; 
GAME:7 &QL; 
__ RESULT: Cal 17, UCLA 0 &QL; 
__ RECORD: 3-4 &QL; 
__ THIS WEEK'S GPA: 1.43 &QL; 
__ CUMULATIVE GPA: 2.45 &QL; 
__ NEXT WEEK: at Oregon State &QL; 
Quarterbacks: &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Cory Paus was pressured all day but wasted great opportunities with
INT and fumble. Drew Bennett's only pass was awful. &QL; 
F &QL; 
Running backs: &QL; 
Bruins sorely missed DeShaun Foster's ability to break tackles.
Keith Brown (21 yards) was no factor. Jermaine Lewis (minus-4
yards) needs to run like Cal freshman Joe Igber. &QL; 
F &QL; 
Receivers: &QL; 
Not much these guys can do except get open and hope the passes are
catchable. Mike Seidman's last-minute drop could have ended the
shutout. &QL; 
C+ &QL; 
Offensive line: &QL; 
What line? When coach Bob Toledo says, ``Football is a game of
one-on-one. You have to beat your man and we didn't beat our man,''
he's talking about these guys. &QL; 
F &QL; 
Defensive line: &QL; 
Don't be fooled by Cal's modest point total. Bears were averaging
94 yards rushing but got 248 on UCLA. What's more, the front four
had one tackle-for-loss and no sacks against the Pac-10's worst
offensive line. &QL; 
C &QL; 
Linebackers: &QL; 
Tony White played his best game (two sacks, seven tackles) and
Robert Thomas was solid again. Shoulder injury to Ali Abdul Azziz
could be a problem; Bruins need his speed. &QL; 
B+ &QL; 
Secondary: &QL; 
Fifth-year seniors couldn't make plays. Ryan Roques, Eric Whitfield
and Joey Strycula were burned on long passes and missed tackles on
long runs. Time for a lineup shuffle? &QL; 
C &QL; 
Special teams: &QL; 
Nate Fikse had as many punts (nine) as Paus had completions.
Special teams didn't lose game for Bruins, but they didn't make big
plays, either. &QL; 
C &QL; 
Coaching: &QL; 
Bruins were whipped physically more than outcoached, but 17-point
loss to a 13-point underdog is everyone's fault. Final month is
coaching staff's biggest test. Will Bruins regress, stagnate or
improve? &QL; 
D+ &QL;

COMMENTARY: ANTI-ANTI-CORRUPTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When anti-communism became dominant in the United
States, a group on the left _ not communist itself, but resentful
of the ideological victors _ launched attacks on the
anti-communists. They called us unreconstructed Cold Warriors,
triumphalist dupes unable to envision the convergence of the Soviet
and American systems. Thus was anti-anti-communism born.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, we now see the emergence of
anti-anti-corruption. It successfully vilified Ken Starr and
continues its counterattack against those who dare investigate,
prosecute, or voice a suspicion at the predations of the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt was notified that no
charges would be brought against him. A friend, lobbying for an
Indian tribe, testified that Babbitt had told him White House
pressure had been brought to bear on a casino gambling case; the
interior secretary claimed to have been misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   Because the prosecutor was independent, not beholden to the
White House, her decision not to prosecute is respected. Babbitt's
reputation is restored; those of us who called for thorough
investigation are now satisfied that he and his revolving-door
aides did nothing prosecutable.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes apparent wrongdoing leads to conviction, sometimes
not. Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, indicted for accepting gifts,
was acquitted, while another jury's conviction of the giver was
overturned on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros copped a guilty plea, with no
jail time, for misleading the FBI about the amount of money he paid
his mistress. That minor charge was unworthy of invoking the act,
but investigators wanted to know where the San Antonio mayor got
all the cash to pay her. The possibility of corruption could hardly
be ignored; no other crime was found and he's a free man.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Starr is ready to return to private life. He produced one
report that found no foul play in the death of Vincent Foster, and
another about foul playing-around that led to the first impeachment
of an elected president. But on Travelgate, Filegate and the Rose
Law Firm missing papers _ matters extensively investigated
involving Hillary Clinton, and of interest to those with long
attention spans _ he leaves with much business unfinished.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-anti-corruption forces say: See? That means there was
nothing to any of this. All a bunch of politics. If it wasn't a
prosecutable crime, it was not wrong, and should never even have
been examined at such expense in trying to overcome claims of
executive privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is duty-bound to file a full information with the court on
all three investigations. The judges can then decide what
conflicting grand jury testimony can be disclosed. If those
investigations were stymied, we have the right to know by whom and
how.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-corruptionists believe that Clinton Justice corruptly
harassed White House employees to justify firing them to replace
them with Arkansas cronies and relatives. We suspect that the White
House's political intrusion into FBI files was more than just
bumbling by a former bouncer.
</P>
<P>
   If thorough investigations find Clinton explanations reasonable,
those of us who suspect chicanery, invasion of privacy and cover-up
should admit without apology that we were mistaken. Likewise, if
noncriminal wrongdoing is revealed, Mrs. Clinton should own up to
it.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's long-overdue report on nonsexual White House conduct
shouldn't be allowed to hang over Hillary Clinton's Senate campaign
next year. In the '80s, the Iran-contra prosecution disgraced
itself with election-eve indictments. Starr should sign off on his
criminal information before leaving.
</P>
<P>
   David Johnston and Don Van Natta Jr. of The New York Times
reported the other day that prosecutor Robert Ray, in line to
replace Starr, is primarily focused on attempts to influence
Kathleen Willey's testimony about her harassment charge. That
always deserved scrutiny, but no prosecution force needs two years
to determine whether to ask for a witness-intimidation indictment.
Ray should wrap it up before December.
</P>
<P>
   With no more independent counsels and with see-no-evil pervasive
at Justice, power's corruption has a bright future. The
counterpunchers of the anti-anti-corruption movement will espouse
giving politicians the benefit of the doubt as long as their
favorite occupies the Oval Office. When that changes, we'll welcome
them over to the anti-corruption side.

A VERBAL BRUSHBACK, COMPOSED BY CLEMENS 
HURTING AND WILLING 
PSYCHED OUT 
OTHER KINDS OF PRESSURE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Boston Red Sox swung freely and comfortably against
Roger Clemens, and Clemens intimated afterward that if he pitches
against the Red Sox again in this series _ ``I hope I don't have
to,'' he added _ he will be ready to knock some hitters down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I need to expand,'' Clemens said Saturday, referring
to the strike zone. ``I just think some guys are just too
comfortable and it is not a great feeling to have. But I just think
some guys get too comfortable up there and you like to expand, and
it is something I need to do more of.''
</P>
<P>
   That's code for ``I need to knock hitters off the plate and make
them less comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't as if Clemens and Hideki Irabu, who relieved
Clemens, received any harsher treatment than some others who have
faced the Red Sox. Dating to the last two games here against
Cleveland in the division series, and including the first three
innings Saturday, the Red Sox had scored 37 runs in the span of 15
innings at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees manager Joe Torre spoke with Clemens Sunday afternoon, a
day after his two-inning performance. ``He's all right,'' Torre
said. ``No question, you can't say it doesn't bother you, because
you expected more of yourself than he gave yesterday. He wanted the
results to be better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that's the good part of being a starting pitcher _ you
have a day to shake the fog out.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurting and Willing
</P>
<P>
   To say that Pedro Martinez wears his heart on his sleeve has a
different connotation than usual. He is making no secret of the
fact that he is pitching in pain, and that he is sure there is
something honorable in this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am hurting,'' Martinez said, after he allowed just two hits
in seven innings in Game 3. ``I am hurting in every pitch I throw,
but you know, I manage to do it somehow and I am not going to quit
on doing it until I know I am not getting anybody out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the team needs me tomorrow and I can give them one out, I
am going to try to do it. It doesn't matter how much I hurt. If I
can throw the ball over, and get one out to get the team to win a
game, I am going to do it. That is what I am here for.''
</P>
<P>
   Psyched Out
</P>
<P>
   Since the fifth inning of a game Pedro Martinez pitched against
the Yankees in May, the Yankees have five hits in 61 at-bats
against him, with 35 strikeouts. Is Joe Torre concerned about
Martinez's dominance getting inside the heads of his players?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question it's in people's heads,'' Torre said.
``His ability is what it is. You can't deny that. You're just going
to have to find a way against a Pedro Martinez to adjust your
approach, and again, adjust what you do at the plate, and just
tough it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Kinds of Pressure
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Hernandez smirked when he was asked about the
possibility of feeling pressure in Game 5 on Monday, and discussed
how fans in Cuba had thrown rocks, tomatoes and ``anything they can
find'' on the field. Essentially, he said, the rowdiest fans at
Fenway Park would not unnerve him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you win, the opposite fans are going to try to beat you any
way they can,'' Hernandez said of pitching in Cuba. ``Then if you
lose, your own fans are going to try to kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre recalled how Hernandez pitched the most important game
of the 1998 season and never became rattled, when he beat the
Indians in Game 4 of the American League Championship Series last
year. Torre does not think Monday night will be any different.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's to scare him after leaving Cuba and, you know, we don't
know what size boat he came over on,'' Torre said. ``But, whatever
it was, it's still the fact that he had to slide out of the country
and hide somewhere and then be found and all this kind of stuff.
It's not the way we got to the ballpark, I know that. So for sure,
this is just a game for him.''

SCOTT TUROW LOOKS AT JUSTICE SERVED IN `PERSONAL INJURIES' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<P>
   ``Personal Injuries'' &QL; 
By Scott Turow &QL; 
(Farrar Straus &AMP; Giroux, $27) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are many lawyers publishing novels these days, but there's
no one better than Scott Turow. He doesn't just churn out
bestsellers. He WRITES them, with intelligence and depth and a feel
for our fascination with the nether regions of the law _ those back
rooms and muted conversations in which the truth comes out, deals
are struck and destinies, however illustrious or tawdry they might
be, are made.
</P>
<P>
   Turow finishes a book like clockwork, every three years:
``Presumed Innocent (1987),'' ``The Burden of Proof
(1990),''``Pleading Guilty (1993)''and ``The Laws of Our Fathers
(1996).'' Now, we have ``Personal Injuries,'' a novel meant not so
much to entertain as to make us think about ambition and
compromise, and their affect on how justice is served.
</P>
<P>
   It's the most layered and introspective book Turow has written.
That doesn't mean it's his best _ there are whole chapters that
will try a reader's patience _ but it's certainly his most
ambitious. And in Scott Turow, ambition can be a mighty impressive
thing.
</P>
<P>
   The character at the center of ``Personal Injuries'' is Robbie
Feaver (pronounced ``favor''), a personal-injury lawyer who with
his partner has been caught shortchanging the IRS. In this
instance, tax evasion is less a crime than convenient leverage _ on
the heels of the IRS agents comes U.S. Attorney Stan Sennett, who
offers to keep Feaver out of jail if he will provide evidence
against judges suspected of taking payoffs from lawyers (Feaver
among them) in exchange for favorable decisions.
</P>
<P>
   There are several judges in question, but the one Sennett really
wants is the powerful Brendan Tuohey, the man most likely to become
chief judge of Kindle County, the fictional setting of Turow's
novels. In his effort to get Tuohey, Sennett sets up an elaborate
ruse that includes fake lawyers, fake clients and fake
personal-injury cases. Project Petros, as the sting is called, will
go on for months, with Robbie Feaver attempting to record judges as
they sniff at, then swallow, his bribes.
</P>
<P>
   Turow uses these circumstances to create some memorable
characters, all laden with contradictions. Stan Sennett is an
ambitious man whose righteous convictions are served by devious and
often cutthroat tactics. Evon Miller, the FBI agent brought in to
pose as Feaver's associate and latest lover, grapples with her own
secrets (she is a poor imitation of Thomas Harris' Clarice Starling
in ``The Silence of the Lambs'') while she tries to fend off
Feaver's amorous attentions.
</P>
<P>
   The crooked judges are colorful even as they flirt with disaster
on Robbie Feaver's surveillance tapes. Barnett Skolnick is a
rambling but likeable dimwit (``There are dead men,'' Feaver says,
``who are not as dumb as Barney Skolnick'') who owes his place on
the bench to the tactics of his brother, a thug named Knuckles.
Sherman Crowthers is a huge and powerfully spoken Black man, once
one of the best defense attorneys in the county, now a judge who
rules his courtroom with rough eloquence and intimidation. And
Brendan Tuohey, the biggest prize, hides his avarice under a veneer
of serenity, protected by the loyalty of the lackeys around him.
</P>
<P>
   But the real enigma is Feaver himself, a pretty boy who appears
to have slept with every woman he has ever met (he would have sex
with a spoon if it seemed willing), yet remains devoted to his
wife, who is dying of Lou Gehrig's disease. Feaver starts the book
as a sleazy yukster, a used-car salesman in an Italian suit and a
perpetual tan, but grows in substance and stature until we almost _
ALMOST _ understand what women see in him. By the end, he is the
novel's symbolic Good Man, and he deserves the emphasis. Caught
among the criminals, the cops and the lawyers, he is the key to all
of their ambitions, but is left with nothing to call his own.
</P>
<P>
   Having created such a dense abundance of character, Turow tells
his story with a surprisingly heavy hand. This is his most
descriptive book, and that's not such a good thing. He gives us the
details of everything _ rugs, desks, buildings, courtrooms,
clothing, people and, most annoyingly, the minutiae of surveillance
(it seems as if we receive an inventory of Robbie's cameras and
microphones every time he approaches a judge over the long months
of Project Petros). Once, when Robbie walks through an innocuous
patch of woods on his way to a golf-course meeting with Brendan
Tuohey, Turow describes not only the trees and the land around him,
but the settlers who had walked that way a century before.
</P>
<P>
   It makes for some slow going, and that, unfortunately, is one of
the lingering impressions of this book: ``Personal Injuries,''
which is 400 pages long, could have lost 50 and been better for it.
There's also the matter of its narrator. George Mason, who is
Robbie Feaver's attorney, begins the novel in the first person,
establishing himself as the teller of the story. His voice fades in
and out, however, giving way without warning to an omniscient
narration in the many scenes during which George is not present
(private conversations between Evon and Robbie, for example, or
between Evon and Robbie's dying wife).
</P>
<P>
   Depending on your mood, you'll think this reappearing ``I'' is
arty or distracting. Or maybe, if you're feeling very generous,
you'll choose to look at it as a lawyer's tactic. After all, as
George tells us from the start, ``This is a lawyer's story, the
kind attorneys like to hear and tell.''
</P>
<P>
   If you want action, look elsewhere. But if you want a glimpse of
the legal profession through one of its own (Scott Turow still
practices in Chicago), this is not a bad place to be. His mistakes
are a writer's mistakes, something most lawyer-novelists don't have
the talent to make. If you want proof, just wait three years. &QL;

   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE POP-UP BOOK OF PHOBIAS'' &QL; 
By Gary Greenberg (Morrow, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We heard about this one before we saw it, and that's always a
good sign. It has been New &AMP; Notable's policy to mock pop-up books
on the grounds that they are both silly and oxymoronic _ something
can't pop up and be a book at the same time. We prefer to think of
them as ````gadgets''.'' The last one we paid any attention to was
about golf courses, and it might have been the nadir of pop-up
books _ little greens rising at you like some dopey delusion, sand
traps floating through the air. So, when we got wind of this one,
we licked our chops, found ``moronic'' in the thesaurus and waited
for the kill. Now, we must eat crow. New &AMP; Notable has been
conquered by a pop-up book, wrestled into submission by a gadget.
Gary Greenberg, the stand-up comedian who created it, begins with
the mother of all phobias, the Dentist and the Drill. This
particular drill twists as it rises into view, and it is big enough
to roto-rooter your nostril. When it reaches dead center, it is
aimed straight at you, right at your very teeth, and behind it is a
dentist who bears more than a passing resemblance to Joseph
Mengele. You have to laugh _ what else can you do? Greenberg has
paired off the ludicrous and the macabre, and we couldn't wait to
turn the page and see what he'd do next. There are 10 phobias here,
including most of the big ones, but we won't say more. The
dentist's drill is funny whether you know it's coming or not, but
others profit from an element of surprise. Either way, phobias beat
golf courses, hands down. &QL;

``DOGS THAT KNOW WHEN THEIR OWNERS ARE COMING HOME'' &QL; 
By Rupert Sheldrake (Crown, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Surely, Sheldrake is preaching to the converted when he makes
the case for studying our own pets (and not just creatures in
research labs) to foster our awareness of ``the unexplained powers
of animals.'' After all, the people most likely to buy his book are
those who agree with him, who object to our longstanding taboo
against taking pets seriously. There's nevertheless something
heartwarming about his arguments, which embrace the animals we love
as both gifted creatures and sources of scientific knowledge.
Through interviews and surveys with pet owners, veterinarians, dog
trainers and zoo keepers in the United States and Britain,
Sheldrake explores the phenomenon of telepathic communication
between people and animals _ in other words, he asks why a dog
might know 20 minutes in advance that its owner is coming home,
even when the owner is unexpected. Or how a cat hearing a ringing
telephone would know that someone it loves is on the other end of
the line. What makes an animal show unmistakable signs of agitation
a full three hours before an earthquake, or enables a horse to find
its way home across unfamiliar terrain? And why, if there are some
dogs that know their owners are coming home, are there other dogs
that don't have a clue? Are some breeds more sensitive than others?
Sheldrake explores animal empathy, the therapeutic effect of pets,
animal-to-animal telepathy, the phenomenon of bird migration, and
animal premonitions. His book is an engaging look at domesticated
creatures and the mysterious things that connect us to them. &QL; 
``PLAINSONG'' &QL; 
By Kent Haruf (Knopf, $24) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This lovely, evocative novel is set in Holt, Colo., a prairie
town so small that it takes only an hour for two boys to deliver
all of its newspapers. Those boys are Ike and Bobby Guthrie, whose
father, Tom, teaches history at the high school, and whose mother,
Ella, has taken silently to her bed and will soon move out of the
house and then out of town altogether. Other characters are
Victoria Roubideaux, a pregnant teenage girl whose mother has
locked her out of the house, and the senior McPheron brothers, two
self-described decrepit old bachelors who agree to let Victoria
come and live with them on their farm until her baby is born. Haruf
lets his characters reveal themselves slowly and compassionately,
and the story that takes shape as the ties between them grow is
oddly comforting even as they grapple with changes in their lives.
The feel of this book is not unlike that of Cormac McCarthy's later
novels, both in tone and in the atmospheric sense of place that
becomes almost a character in itself (missing is McCarthy's
trademark violence, although there is one menacing scene in which
Ike and Bobby are roughed up by a teenage bully). Haruf has written
a quietly moving book about ordinary people dealing with the
emotional twists of ordinary life. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``BROTHERS'' &QL; 
(Hyperion, $26.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Writing about my brothers is a dangerous occupation, dancing
through a minefield,'' Frank McCourt says. Maybe so, but there's
something to be said for having tissues on hand if you intend to
read this book _ you might get weepy. There are some fine writers
here _ McCourt, Tobias Wolff, Richard Ford, David Sedaris, James
Alan McPherson _ all talking about their brothers and the bonds and
conflicts between them. We were most taken, however, with the essay
by Charles P. Pierce, who is the son of a brother and the father of
brothers, but who himself is an only child. His is the clear-eyed
view from beyond: ``I have watched brothers all my life,'' he says.
``I watched them in my family growing up, and I watch my children
today, the blood speech of the code-talkers in the other bedrooms,
the swift bursts of anger and the reconciliations, all operating on
rules as foreign and distant to me as Hammurabi's Code.'' Mixed
with these essays are portraits of brothers, some well-known (the
Dalai Lama and his brother, Martin Scorsese and his), some not at
all. This was put together by the editors of ``Esquire.'' &QL;

LEARN (Phoenix) _ A University of Arizona junior learns biology and
psychology by talking to a parrot. An Arizona State University
student masters English composition, not from a book, but from
teaching disadvantaged kids. Seniors at Northern Arizona University
learn business by advising a Flagstaff music store on marketing
strategies. They're all part of a trend sweeping higher education
called learner-centered education _ a shift from passive learning
in lecture halls to active learning through independent discovery.
The concept is filtering through all levels of the state's three
universities, and has become the central focus of a yearlong
examination by the Arizona Board of Regents. Story by BEVERLY

BULLFIGHTS (NOGALES, Sonora, Mexico) _ Mario de la Fuente knows
that many Americans abhor blood sports, so he suggests they stay
home whenbullfighting returns to this border city next month.  &UR; De
la Fuente is banking on Americans filling most of the 5,000 seats
in his new round, very red arena with aluminum siding and clear
acrylic top. On Nov. 14, he will bring bullfighting back to Nogales
after a nearly 30-year absence, with events twice a month.
Bullfighting enjoyed its heyday in Nogales in the 1950s and early
'60s, when such celebrities as John Wayne, Gary Cooper and Sonny
Liston regularly attended Sunday afternoon corridas at an outdoor
stadium decorated with matador frescos. By MARK SHAFFER. Story will

HIGHER EDUCATION SHIFTS FOCUS: TEACHERS NOW `GUIDE ON THE SIDE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BEVERLY MEDLYN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ A University of Arizona junior learns biology and
psychology by talking to a parrot.
</P>
<P>
   An Arizona State University student masters English composition,
not from a book, but from teaching disadvantaged kids.
</P>
<P>
   Seniors at Northern Arizona University learn business by
advising a Flagstaff music store on marketing strategies.
</P>
<P>
   They're all part of a trend sweeping higher education called
learner-centered education _ a shift from passive learning in
lecture halls to active learning through independent discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a fundamental change in the role of the faculty. They
are increasingly the guide on the side rather than the sage on the
stage,'' said Peter Likins, president of the University of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The switch, Likens said, is the most profound change he has seen
in 35 years as a professor.
</P>
<P>
   The concept is filtering through all levels of the state's three
universities, and has become the central focus of a yearlong
examination by the Arizona Board of Regents.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Guskin, former president of Antioch University and a
national expert on learner-centered education, said institutions
across the country are grappling with the topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense about Arizona is there is a lot of exciting ferment,
a lot of interesting ideas going on,'' Guskin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's a very big jump to go from teacher-centered learning
to student-centered,'' he added, ``in which students learn in many
different venues, the classroom being but one.''
</P>
<P>
   That's true of Robert Sandefer, a University of Arizona junior
majoring in biology and psychology.
</P>
<P>
   He's among 140 students in the UA's undergraduate biology
research program, designed to teach students science by involving
them in projects that once were done only by graduate students. &QL; 
`INTENSIVE' LEARNING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very intensive, very personalized way of learning for
the student,'' said Carol Bender, program director.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are learning how to apply everything from their past
experience to a problem that has not yet been solved.''
</P>
<P>
   On any given afternoon, Sandefer conducts experiments on
cognition with an African grey parrot named Alex, who is presented
with two stacking cups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pick up the yellow cup,'' Sandefer says.
</P>
<P>
   On a good day, Alex walks over the table and picks up the yellow
cup. He is rewarded by a nut that lies beneath.
</P>
<P>
   When Alex makes the right choice 16 out of 20 times, Sandefer
puts out a new cup in an unfamiliar color next to the yellow cup,
and instructs: ``Pick up the cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandefer is waiting for the moment Alex turns and asks: ``What
color?''
</P>
<P>
   Alex will then prove he knows he needs more information, and is
therefore self-aware.
</P>
<P>
   Some techniques derived from such research have been applied to
developmentally delayed children, Sandefer said. Other findings
could help neurologically impaired people use alternate structures
in their brains to learn tasks. &QL; 
LEARNING BY TUTORING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ASU's Meghan Ederle is learning English composition by tutoring
kids at the Salvation Army's South Mountain Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experiences I have at this site I reflect back on paper,''
Ederle said. South Phoenix's cultural diversity and economic
challenges are fodder for essays that earn her English course
credit.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 2,000 ASU students have participated in the tutoring
program, which has helped 7,679 children in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Students like ASU education major Kristy Kay Stover get to
observe youngsters learn rather than simply read textbooks about
how kids process information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned what kids know and what their troubles are,''
Stover said. &QL; 
HELP BUSINESSES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Flagstaff, students in Northern Arizona University's Small
Business Institute and Students In Free Enterprise program are
gaining knowledge by helping small businesses with real-world
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Ochsner and Martha Memmer, owners of Cedar Music, turned to
NAU students for help. Within a year, they had a 200-page report
packed with ideas for improving the bottom line, plus a $25,000
loan.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Borstadt, an NAU finance professor, said the students ``are
developing leadership, teamwork and communication skills.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the soft skills employers are really after,''
Borstadt said.
</P>
<P>
   The same skills are honed through Students in Free Enterprise, a
national organization. NAU's chapter has completed 64
entrepreneurial projects and 378 presentations, Borstadt said, as
well as working with K-12 students in 38 schools and 38 businesses
in northern Arizona. &QL; 
PROCESS LESS EFFICIENT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adapting to individual student learning styles is the faculty's
focus, Likins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Learning through discovery, as opposed to learning through
authority is a less efficient process,'' he said. ``It may take you
longer to get to the truth because there is an element of trial and
error. But it produces a deeper, more enduring kind of learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Book-learning and lectures are still part of the process. But so
are conducting independent research, working in teams, learning
from colleagues, and scouring the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Gignac, immediate past president of the regents, said the
movement is ``catching fire'' and could lead to profound changes in
higher education.
</P>
<P>
   Focusing on the student calls the current system of
degree-preparation into question, she said. Rather than have
everyone complete a set number of credit hours for a degree, should
individual programs be crafted, based on each student's knowledge
base?
</P>
<P>
   The cost effectiveness of learner-centered education has yet to
be quantified. Charles Bantz, senior vice provost at ASU, noted
that there will be additional short-term costs for training,
developing materials and other needs.
</P>
<P>
   Are the payoffs worth it? Small-scale studies indicate students
learn more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time now for the board and the universities to define
more clearly what we view as measurable outcomes,'' ASU President
Lattie Coor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is where the board will turn _ how to define it and
measure it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gignac said the issues also will be aired before the Governor's
Higher Education Task Force and at a town hall scheduled for May in
Prescott.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's enough enthusiasm generated for this kind of
change, do what you love and the money will follow,'' she said.
``That may be the case with this. Who knows?'' &QL;

 &HT;    Falcons fall to 1-5 as second shot at Rams turns into another
runaway
 &HT;    By Matt Winklejohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Falcons were looking for revenge and redemption in
their rematch Sunday with the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   All they got was a repeat whipping.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, after crumbling against the NFL's only unbeaten team
41-13, in front of a hostile Georgia Dome crowd of 51,973, they got
a lashing in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   This happens when a team goes from the Super Bowl to 1-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Coach Dan Reeves) came in and said if anybody wants to quit
let him know because he'll get 'em out right now,'' strong-side
linebacker Craig Sauer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he's questioning players; I have no idea,'' defensive
tackle Travis Hall said. ``I'm not in that boat, so I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' boat is taking on water fast. Every imaginable
thing that could go wrong has.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Chris Chandler's strained right hamstring was well
enough for him to play for the third time in six games. But for the
third time, he didn't finish, sidelined in the third quarter when
Reeves took him out because of flu-like symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   But it was an avalanche of mistakes that ruined the Falcons'
chances to prove last month's 35-7 loss in St. Louis was a fluke.
The Rams are now 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 10 penalties (and three turnovers). We just are not a
disciplined football team right now,'' said Reeves, who continues
to say publicly that his team's effort is not an issue. ``That is
my responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   There's more. In a season marked by miserable turnover ratio,
awful run defense and a poor running attack, the Falcons had all
three working _ against them. They gave up 189 rushing yards, while
rushing for 39. Both were the worst since a 35-28 loss at San
Francisco on Oct. 19, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons outgained St. Louis 316-283 and held an edge in time
of possession (31:12-28:48), but made mistakes at all the wrong
times. Three turnovers resulted in 13 St. Louis points.
</P>
<P>
   After the Falcons cut the lead to 14-7 in the second quarter,
the Rams' Tony Horne returned a kickoff 101 yards for a 21-7 lead.
After getting their first fumble recovery of the season, Atlanta
moved to the 9. But on first-and-goal, a Chandler interception was
returned 91 yards by Rams defensive end Grant Wistrom.
</P>
<P>
   Rams quarterback Kurt Warner had season lows of 111 passing
yards and one touchdown. But running back Marshall Faulk more than
made up for it, rushing 18 times for 181 yards.
</P>
<P>
   By the middle of the third quarter, fans began doing the
Tomahawk Chop in anticipation of the Braves' playoff game. The
Falcons' victory vibe has gone ka-poof.
</P>
<P>
   ``Year to year, the chemistry and karma of a team is always
different because the team is not exactly the same,'' right guard
Gene Williams said. ``We shoot ourselves in the foot all the time.
It seems like we've been lining up in front of a firing squad ...
and just getting blasted.''

SCIENTISTS ARE MYSTIFIED BY DEATHS OF LOBSTERS IN LONG ISLAND
SOUND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)  (js) 
 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marine experts suspect that a mysterious pathogen has killed
tens of thousands of lobsters in Long Island Sound this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The die-off, described as the worst to hit Long Island Sound in
nearly a decade, has alarmed hundreds of lobstermen in New York and
Connecticut and has prompted extensive laboratory testing by state
and federal environmental officials.
</P>
<P>
   While cautioning that much more lab work needs to be done,
Gordon C. Colvin, the marine resources director of the New York
Department of Environmental Conservation, said Sunday that water
quality tests had eliminated two possibilities _ pollution or low
levels of oxygen in the water. He added that blood samples taken
from lobsters had provided no solid evidence of gaffkemia, a common
and often fatal bacterial infection in lobsters.
</P>
<P>
   The working hypothesis, he said, is that some other bacterium or
virus is killing the lobsters, which become sluggish before dying
although they otherwise appear normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably have a different pathogen at work here,'' Colvin
said. ``We've pretty much ruled out environmental factors. It's a
question of trying to find someone who can help us determine if
there is a pathogen.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few weeks, officials in New York and Connecticut
have taken blood from lobsters and sent it to several laboratories,
including the University of Arizona in Tucson, the Food and Drug
Administration in Washington and the National Marine Fisheries
Service in Milford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there is no reason to fear eating lobsters from the
Sound, said Byron H. Young, chief of the finfish and crustacean
unit of the New York Department of Environmental Conservation. No
one has reported getting sick after eating lobster, and cooking
lobsters in boiling water would kill any microbes, Young said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the lobster is alive and kicking, there is no reason to
believe there is a problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But for those who fish the Sound, the problem is that too many
lobsters are already dead by the time they are pulled from traps.
In recent weeks, some lobstermen have stopped fishing altogether.
``It's just basically a losing proposition,'' said Robert L.
Eberhardt, a 52-year-old lobsterman who works out of Northport, a
harbor village on the North Shore of Long Island. ``Between fuel,
bait and crew, you come out behind.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Jeff W. Carbone, the owner of Portland Maine Seafood Co. in
Huntington, N.Y., said he was mystified. ``I've never experienced
anything like it and I've been doing this for more than 30 years,''
he said. Carbone's lobster supply house holds up to 25,000 pounds
of live lobsters in its water tanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them look like a perfect lobster,'' he said. ``They
cook fine. They eat good. Visually there's nothing wrong that you
can see. But they keep dying. They're dying every day, and the
scary thing is we'll never know how many didn't get in the traps.
How many are down there dead?''
</P>
<P>
   Marine experts say they are unsure of the full scope of the
die-off, which was reported late last week in several Long Island
newspapers. Offering what he described as a conservative estimate,
Young said ``tens of thousands'' of lobsters have died already,
with roughly eight of every 100 captured lobsters coming up dead.
Blue crabs and rock crabs, too, are dying, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Lobster boats first began reporting the deaths about six weeks
ago, particularly in the western third of Long Island Sound.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Millions of lobsters are caught in the Sound each year, and
summer is the prime season for lobstering, an increasingly
important component of the local fishing industry. New York has 900
commercially licensed lobstermen, and lobsters now rate ahead of
clams as the state's most valuable maritime crop.
</P>
<P>
   For years, marine life in the western portion of the Sound has
been plagued by low levels of dissolved oxygen, which can be caused
by algae blooms. When lobster captains complained this summer of
small catches, many attributed the problem to poor oxygen levels.
But, Colvin said, oxygen levels had already returned to normal by
the time the die-off began.
</P>
<P>
   Deepening the mystery, he said, is the fact that other die-offs
have been observed several times this decade. ``We've had reports
of lobsters in this condition since 1990,'' Colvin said. ``It
usually starts in early autumn, and then it seems to end by late
October when the water gets good and cold. Last year's was worse
than the other years, until now.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It may be significant, he said, that microbial activity tails
off when the water cools, but the patterns of the lobster die-off
are difficult to read. In some parts of the Sound, such as the
waters off Greenwich, Conn., half the lobsters in a trap may come
up dead. Other times all the lobsters are fine.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the initial laboratory work has been done by Richard
Robohm, a microbiologist for the National Marine Fisheries Service.
He searched for evidence of bacteria in blood from 10 lobsters
recovered by Connecticut environmental officials. In nine of the 10
lobsters, he said, ``the blood looked fine.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the 10th lobster, he found evidence of bacteria. The
results, he said, suggest only one clear conclusion _ that more
testing must be done. ``It's a mystery,'' he said.

 &HT;    Benitez too much for Braves to figure
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York _ As much attention as Braves closer John Rocker has
gotten this series, Mets closer Armando Benitez has been as tough,
if not more so. Until the 10th inning on Sunday evening, the Braves
hadn't touched him all season, going 0-for-26.
</P>
<P>
   So when Eddie Perez singled to left to start the 10th inning,
the Braves had to figure they were finally on to something. But
Benitez proved his nastiness when he retired Walt Weiss on a
strikeout after Weiss three times failed to get a bunt down before
finally fouling a ball down the first-base line.
</P>
<P>
   Ozzie Guillen had the best at-bat of the postseason against
Benitez Saturday night, coming a few feet foul of a home run to
right field and eventually flying out to deep right. But pinch
hitting in the 10th, he popped out to Mike Piazza for the second
out, and Gerald Williams grounded out to Edgardo Alfonzo.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't really sit on one pitch,'' said Keith Lockhart, who
struck out looking against Benitez to end Saturday night's game.
``First you've got to see it. You'd still have trouble hitting if
he went up there and told you fastball.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ozzie had our best at-bat against him yet,'' hitting coach Don
Baylor said. ``He got the head of the bat out there (expecting the
fastball). If he's going to be macho, you better be macho too.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson back
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Rickey Henderson show up on Sunday afternoon, he
started. Henderson was livid with manager Bobby Valentine Saturday
night after he was replaced in left field by Melvin Mora, but not
until he had already run out onto the field to start the eighth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson had walked out of the Mets dugout during the game,
reportedly telling his teammates, ``I'm outta here,'' implying he
meant more than just out of the dugout. But Valentine insisted
Henderson was there until the end in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to my coaches about that today, and the timing of
that was very bad and in particular for a player of Rickey's
stature,'' Valentine said. ``And I expressed those concerns to him
(Saturday). . . . Some of my coaches thought it was improper to
take him out at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said he was deciding who to get up in the bullpen, and
he forgot to tell Mora to go in, something that usually is handled
by his bench coach Bruce Benedict. But Benedict has been coaching
third base this series while Cookie Rojas served the fourth of a
five-game suspension for shoving umpire Charlie Williams in the
last game of the Division Series against Arizona. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Mets right fielder Roger Cedeno showed up at the ballpark with
back spasms, forcing him out of Sunday's starting lineup. He was
replaced by Mora.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been bothered now for about the last week,'' Valentine
said. ``But today he came in with a pretty severe spasm.'' Cedeno
later entered the game as a pinch-runner in the 15th inning.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker has appeared in 10 consecutive NLCS games, including
all six last year against the Padres and the first four of this
year's series against the Mets.

 &HT;    Atlanta loses to New York Mets in marathon
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sunday's Game 5 of the NLCS will be remembered as one
of the most interesting in postseason history. It will definitely
be remembered as the longest.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Braves appeared to have had the game won in the top
of the 15th inning after Keith Lockhart tripled to score Walt Weiss
for a 3-2 lead. But the New York's Todd Pratt walked with the bases
loaded in the bottom of the inning to tie the game, and Robin
Ventura followed with a grand slam to stun the Braves 4-3 and force
Game 6 Tuesday at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   The game, the longest postseason contest in major league
history, was filled with several pitching moves, botched bunting
attempts and a steady rain for most of the contest, which lasted
nearly six hours. The Braves very easily could have won it in the
13th inning after Lockhart got a two-out single off Octavio Dotel.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones followed him with a rip to right field for a
double on a hit-and-run, which would have put runners at the
corners for Brian Jordan, the Braves best clutch hitter.
</P>
<P>
   But Braves third base coach Ned Yost got greedy and blew it, by
sending Lockhart home despite Melvin Mora's clean play in right
field and good throw to the cutoff man in Edgardo Alfonzo. He
completed the deal with a good relay throw to Mike Piazza, who
nailed Lockhart easily for the last out of the 13th inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets and Braves had been knotted at 2-2 since the fourth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets took a 2-0 lead on Greg Maddux in the first inning on
some more John Olerud heroics. He got his third consecutive hit of
the series by taking Maddux deep to right field for a two-run
homer, his second in his previous three at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux got pushed around for another two hits to the next four
batters he faced but he put an end to that quickly. The only other
threat the Mets mounted on him came on a pair of Ryan Klesko errors
in the sixth inning. But Maddux got out of it by getting Rey
Ordonez to bounce his first pitch to Walt Weiss for a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones, who'd endured offensive misery for the first four
games of this series, chimed in with a two-run contribution to even
the score on Mosato Yoshii in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   He drove in his first run of the series with his first extra
base hit of the series when he doubled down the third base line to
score Bret Boone.
</P>
<P>
   After two days of offensive futility (6 for 56), Jones and the
Braves had finally started to get some hits, just not when they
needed them the most. The Braves stranded a dozen runners from the
fourth to ninth innings and Orel Hershiser started it off by
rescuing Yoshii, who had allowed four consecutive baserunners on
three hits and a walk.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser made his first appearance of the NLCS and a lasting
impression when he struck out Andruw Jones, Eddie Perez and then
got Walt Weiss on a groundout to stop a Braves two-run rally. Those
three at-bats became the first in an 0 for 10 stretch for Braves
hitters with runners in scoring position going through the 10th
inning.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mets general manager Steve Phillips had wondered
Saturday why the Mets could not be the first team to come back from
three games down to win a best-of-7 playoff series. It could not be
harder, he figured, than hitting 70 home runs or pitching a perfect
game. Phillips did not factor in whether the feat _ which the
Braves failed to accomplish last year against San Diego in the
league championships _ would be any harder than completing a
marathon.
</P>
<P>
   But after nearly six hours, after nine of the 11 Mets pitchers
on the roster had made their way to the mound, after Bobby
Valentine had pinch hit for the last reliever he had left, the Mets
could actually walk home when Braves reliever Kevin McGlinchy
issued a bases-loaded walk to Todd Pratt to tie the game in the
bottom of the 15th inning and Robin Ventura, who was 1 for 18 when
he came to the plate, smashed a ball over the wall with the bases
loaded to end the game, 4-3, to force the series back to Atlanta
for a Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura was mobbed by his teammates and never made it past
second base, so he was credited with a single. Roger Cedeno scored
the winning run from third, but the rest of the base runners joined
in the celebration rather than crossing home plate.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are just the second team _ the Braves last year were
the first _ to win two games after being down 3-0 in a best-of-7
series. There is now seemingly no end to the Mets' improbable run
through the postseason. They have been nearly dead several times,
but Sunday night's resurrection _ after the Braves had scored in
the top half of the 15th off rookie reliever Octavio Dotel to take
the lead _ makes all the comebacks that came before seem minor by
comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams had numerous chances to blow the game open.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets took a 2-0 lead in the first inning on John Olerud's
home run _ he drove in all three New York runs in Game 4 and had
hit a grand slam off Maddux Sept. 29 _ but they stranded Mike
Piazza on first base with one out.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Hamilton led off the second inning with a double, but he
remained at second, as did the Braves' Eddie Perez, who led off
their half of the third with a double.
</P>
<P>
   But in the fourth inning, Atlanta's first hitter, Bret Boone,
smacked a pitch from Masato Yoshii into left field. Rickey
Henderson, at the center of a controversy over his reaction to
being replaced in Game 4, did not break back for the ball until it
was too late. It went over his head and bounced off the wall for a
double.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones then slapped a 1-1 pitch down the third-base line.
It skipped over the bag and caromed off the wall in foul territory,
scoring Boone, and then rolled back into fair territory for a
double. Brian Jordan followed with a single to left that reached
Henderson on a bounce to tie the score at 2-2. Yoshii walked Ryan
Klesko on a full count to put two runners on with none out. But
Orel Hershiser, who had last pitched Oct. 8 when he threw an inning
of relief in a loss to Arizona in the division series, relieved
Yoshii and got out of the inning without allowing the Braves to
score again.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves and the Mets, who have each had trouble scoring in
this series, then had to work out of repeated jams to keep the
score tied. In the fifth, Gerald Williams hit a one-out double, but
was stranded. In the sixth, both teams had the bases loaded with
the help of errors by the opposing first basemen, and neither team
scored because of superb defensive plays.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves stranded their three when Maddux, with two out, tried
to squeeze Klesko home from third. But Hershiser's pitch was low
and away and the bunting Maddux missed the ball. Klesko had broken
from third and was almost halfway down the line when Mike Piazza
threw to to Robin Ventura. With Klesko caught between third and
home, Ventura threw to Hershiser along the line, and he made the
tag to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had an even better chance in their half of the sixth.
Piazza, leading off, hit a grounder to third. On Jones' throw to
first, Piazza stumbled over Klesko's leg and tumbled to the ground,
but was safe when Klesko dropped the throw. Ventura struck out, but
Melvin Mora _ starting in place of the injured Roger Cedeno _
singled to right, moving Piazza to second.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Hamilton, next up, hit a hard bouncer to Klesko. He threw
to second. The throw was high and wide, pulling shortstop Walt
Weiss off the bag, and the bases were loaded. But Rey Ordonez, 1
for 16 in the series as he came to the plate, swung at the first
pitch and grounded into a double play that ended the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves threatened again in the seventh, loading the bases
against a succession of four pitchers _ Hershiser, Turk Wendell,
Dennis Cook and Pat Mahomes. Mahomes got Andruw Jones to fly out to
left to end that inning.
</P>
<P>
   Back and forth they went, each team putting runners on, each
team failing to score.
</P>
<P>
   In the Braves' eighth, Weiss hit a one-out double and Jose
Hernandez, pinch-hitting for Maddux, struck out. After Gerald
Williams was intentionally walked, John Franco _ the Mets' fifth
reliever of the game _ coaxed Keith Lockhart, who had entered the
game earlier at second base, to ground out to first.
</P>
<P>
   Now it was the Mets' turn. Olerud singled off Terry Mulholland
to start the eighth, but was left there when Piazza struck out and
Ventura, 0 for 15 in the series at this point, grounded into an
inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   Franco began the ninth by striking out Chipper Jones. Ventura
gave the Braves life when he couldn't hold onto a roller by Jordan,
which was ruled a hit. But Brian Hunter popped up when Franco threw
him a fastball on his fists and Andruw Jones struck out.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets went down in order in the ninth, sending the game to
extra innings, an appropriate way to extend a series filled with
closely contested, intrigue-filled games. There had been only one
other extra-inning game between the teams this season, and the
result was ominous for the Mets: the Braves beat them in 11 innings
on Sept. 30 and thought they were leaving the Mets for dead, two
games out of the wild-card slot with three games to play.
</P>
<P>
   That was the darkest day of the season for the Mets, the day
Hamilton admitted the season was on life support.

   New York _ Hand it to the Braves bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Cox gave them the ball in the eighth inning Sunday
and they held the Mets scoreless until the 15th inning of a 4-3
loss to the New York Mets
</P>
<P>
   As a light rain fell in Shea Stadium during the longest major
league game in history, the bodies in the bullpen gravitated toward
the mound, then the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   And then there were none. Cox used all five of his relievers,
including three faces who hadn't been seen yet in the NLCS, as the
Braves and Mets engaged in a war of attrition. The Mets used nine
of their 11 pitchers, including starter Kenny Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin McGlinchy, a 22-year-old rookie making his first
appearance in the NLCS, got the win in 1 2/3 innings of work after
Keith Lockhart drove in Walt Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   After pitching 6 1/3 innings in the first four games of the
NLCS, the Atlanta bullpen more than doubled its presence in this
series, pitching what would have been almost a full game in any
under circumstances. In 14 1/3 innings, they have given up only one
earned run.
</P>
<P>
   Braves right-handed ace Greg Maddux pitched seven innings,
giving up seven hits, as well as two runs in the first on John
Olerud's second homer of the series. Olerud had previously hit a
grand slam off Maddux in his most recent appearance at Shea
Stadium, a 9-2 Braves loss on Sept. 29.
</P>
<P>
   But Maddux was almost forgotten as the afternoon game stretched
into the night and set a record for longest game in major league
baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Mulholland, a left-handed starter/reliever making his
first NLCS appearance, came in to begin the eighth inning. He gave
up a single to Olerud, struck out Mike Piazza, then Robin Ventura
hit into a double play. He had a strikeout in both innings.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Remlinger, another left-hander, took over in the 10th,
pitching in his fourth NLCS game. In two innings, he had two
strikeouts and his only lapse was giving up a hit to Ventura, who
had been hitless throughout the NLCS.
</P>
<P>
   To start the 12th, right-hander Russ Springer, also pitching for
the first time in the league series, issued the first walk of the
game to Benny Agbayani. But Springer made short work of the next
three batters, and he was through.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Cox, not knowing which inning would be the last,
decided it was time for John Rocker in the 13th. Rocker, a powerful
left-hander, made his 11th straight appearance in an NLCS game, and
already held the record.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker's war of words continued with the Mets fans. After
retiring the side, including Mike Piazza, he yelled to the crowd
above the dugout, ``I just struck out your best hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox asked Rocker how he felt, and the pitcher said he was good
to go. But Cox needed him only to face Robin Ventura. When Rocker
left the game after getting Ventura to fly out to center, Rocker
said ``Boo me.'' Then he booed the fans as he approached the
dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was McGlinchy's turn. McGlinchy, a big right-hander,
gave up a huge single to Shawon Dunston. Pitching coach Leo Mazzone
came out to tell McGlinchy to try to hold him at first as he faced
pinch-hitter Matt Franco. But Dunston stole second, and McGlinchy
walked Franco.

EVERYONE HEALTHY, RANGERS MOVE INTO TIE FOR FIRST
</HEADLINE>

 By   JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This was what the Rangers' president, Neil Smith,
must have envisioned when he was engaged in his off-season spending
spree. Theo Fleury scoring goals. Four solid lines dividing ice
time. A healthy Mike Richter making tricky saves. And the Rangers
perched at the top of their division after just eight games.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are 4-3-1, tied with the Devils atop the Atlantic
Division, after their 4-1 victory over the expansion Atlanta
Thrashers Sunday night at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since opening night, Oct. 1 in Edmonton, the
Rangers were complete Sunday night. Not only was Richter in goal,
Valery Kamensky was back on the ice, too. And Fleury was doing
exactly what he is being paid $28 million over the next four
seasons to do: score goals.
</P>
<P>
   Fleury scored two on his first two shots to give him four on the
season. And Richter, in his first game in 15 days, sparkled in
goal. He stopped 30 of 31 shots for his first victory of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Rangers' fourth victory in their last five games.
</P>
<P>
   Everything had to feel right for Smith Sunday night other than
the Rangers' inexplicably punchless power play, which went 0 for 3
and is now 3 for 39 on the season.
</P>
<P>
   Richter, who has a slightly protruding disk in his lower back,
had missed the last five games; Kamensky, who has been bothered by
a stress fracture in his right forearm, the last six.
</P>
<P>
   Having all hands available enabled coach John Muckler to tinker
with his line combinations heading into the game. Kamensky skated
with Petr Nedved and Mike Knuble. Mike York centered a line with
Adam Graves and Fleury. Tim Taylor skated with Kevin Stevens to his
left and John MacLean to his right. And Manny Malhotra skated with
Darren Langdon and Todd Harvey to open the game, with Harvey back
at right wing, his experiment at left wing apparently over.
Langdon's presence on the ice for the opening faceoff precipitated
an immediate line change by the Thrashers. And just 14 seconds into
the game, Langdon and Atlanta's Matt Johnson were fighting behind
the play.
</P>
<P>
   The fisticuffs were evidently intended as a payback for Johnson,
whose hit on Jeff Beukeboom in Los Angeles last Nov. 19 _ when
Johnson was a member of the Kings _ helped lead to Beukeboom's
early retirement as a result of concussions.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a minute later, the Rangers went up 1-0 on Fleury's
third goal of the season. Muckler had not been pleased with
Fleury's play last Thursday, in a 5-2 thrashing by the Pittsburgh
Penguins. But Muckler had to be happy with the way Fleury, Graves
and York meshed on their first shift Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   It was Graves' work behind the Atlanta net that set up the goal.
Graves took out a pair of Thrashers on the play as they fought for
the puck along the end boards. York pounced on the loose puck, and,
from behind Atlanta goaltender Norm Maracle's right shoulder, York
fed Fleury alone in front. Fleury banged the pass home on a play
that Maracle barely contested. And it was 1-0 Rangers just 1 minute
8 seconds into the game on the Rangers' first shot of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides had eight shots apiece after one period.
</P>
<P>
   Richter, who looked sharp early, stayed that way. Atlanta took
nine of the first 12 shots in the second period, but Richter did
not allow any past him.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Rangers finally found a way to take advantage of their
special teams: they scored on the delayed penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Nedved scored at 9:40, seconds after he had jumped on the ice as
an extra skater after Atlanta captain Kelly Buchberger had taken
down York behind the Atlanta net. With no stop in play because the
Thrashers could not touch up, the puck wound up on rookie
defenseman Kim Johnsson's stick near the blue line.
</P>
<P>
   Johnsson faked a shot, then slid a nifty pass to Nedved, who let
loose from above the left wing circle. The puck caromed off the
stick of Atlanta's Denny Lambert, who was reaching back from the
slot in an attempt to block the shot. Instead, Lambert redirected
the shot into the net. And Nedved not only had his second goal of
the season, but a point in each of his last five games.
</P>
<P>
   Less than four minutes later, Fleury struck again. This time, it
was on a two-on-one rush with York, after Graves had made a nice
neutral-ice pass to Fleury past a gambling Kevin Dean to set up the
odd-man rush down the ice. Fleury skated down right wing, made a
lovely move to pull the puck around Chris Tamer, as Tamer dived to
the ice in front of the Atlanta goal, then shot at Maracle. The
puck caromed off Dean's stick _ Dean was reaching out from the slot
behind the play in a vain attempt to block Fleury's shot _ and past
Maracle at 13:21 of the second. Fleury had his first multiple-goal
game as a Ranger.
</P>
<P>
   And the Rangers had a 3-0 lead over what looked like a tired
expansion team, one that was playing its third game in four days.

FIRMS RACE TO LOCK IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES &HT;    By TOM ABATE  
c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle &HT;    SAN FRANCISCO _ Digital music became one of this year's biggest
<TEXT>
Internet success stories after several firms started selling
Walkman-like devices that let people listen to digital tunes
without sitting at a PC.
<P>
   So it came as quite a shock this summer when a tiny Cupertino,
Calif., firm called Audiohighway.com said it had a patent on
portable digital music players _ and promptly informed all the
companies making such devices that they'd either have to pay it
royalties or quit peddling their wares.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be like Ford saying that since he created the first
car, nobody else can build cars,'' Ron Moore, general counsel for
Diamond Multimedia of Milpitas, Calif., one of the device-makers,
said in July.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Actually, a patent can do just that. Patents confer a 20-year,
government-sanctioned monopoly over a given technology. Patent
holders can stop anyone else from using an invention, or grant
licenses in return for royalty fees.
</P>
<P>
   The Audiohighway flap is just one example of the brawls that are
erupting in every technical field _ software, hardware, e-commerce
and biotechnology _ as firms persuade the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office to grant them exclusive rights to new technologies.
Questionable patents can stall the pace of innovation and
competition in an industry.
</P>
<P>
   Patent disputes aren't new. But critics say the lightning pace
of innovation, the increasing complexity of inventions and the
financial stakes of patent ownership make it tougher for the patent
office to perform its traditional role _ deciding who invented what
first.
</P>
<P>
   Seth Shulman, author of ``Owning the Future,'' a book about the
patent process running amok, argues that the Patent Office is
granting so many questionable patents that it may be impeding
progress instead of promoting it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patents are being misused to gain ownership claims over broad
conceptual terrain that used to be freely shared,'' Shulman said.
</P>
<P>
   His favorite example is the eye doctor who patented a type of
cataract incision and tried to stop other surgeons from using it.
``What's &LR;   &LR; next,'' he asked rhetorically, ``a patent on the
Heimlich maneuver?''
</P>
<P>
   The loudest complaints of so-called patent abuse have involved
Internet firms. Travel auction site Priceline.com made headlines
for patenting the practice of letting people name the price they
wanted to pay for goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said it never should have gotten such a patent, but the
bigger surprise was that Washington, D.C., attorney Thomas Woolston
said he got a patent on the same idea _ 17 months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that get controversial patents are understandably
defensive. ``Some people see us as `Johnny-come-latelys' but
they're wrong,'' said Audiohighway co-founder Grant Jasmin. It was
1994 when his company created the Listen-Up Player, a device to
download digital music over phone or cable lines and play it back.
Audiohighway applied for a patent in 1995. It was issued in June.
</P>
<P>
   Audiohighway never sold many of its Listen-Up Players, which
used proprietary software to digitize music, and ceased selling the
device in 1998. That, ironically, is roughly when the new crop of
portable digital players began to appear _ using the free, MP3
software for digitizing sound and using the Web as the download
path.
</P>
<P>
   Now it will be up to the lawyers and the courts to decide
whether Audiohighway's patent is enforceable. Meanwhile, similar
disputes seem in the offing. Last month, for instance, DoubleClick
of New York revealed that it had a patent on delivering ads over
the Internet, which could affect every one of its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of PATENTS1 (103643 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  At the center of the controversy is Todd Dickinson, whose role as
acting commissioner of patents and trademarks makes him the
middleman in a perpetual tug of war. Patent filers like
Audiohighway urge him to expedite certifying that their
``inventions'' are novel, useful and nonobvious _ prerequisites for
obtaining a patent. But every time his office makes a controversial
call, critics charge that it is just rubber-stamping outrageous
claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we perfect? No. Are we doing a great job at keeping up
with a tremendous increase in the number and complexity of patent
applications? Absolutely,'' Dickinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1997 and 1998 alone, applications soared 13 percent, as
243,062 wannabe inventors asked the patent office to certify their
claims. To keep up with this workload, Dickinson is trying to hire
1,300 new patent examiners to augment the 2,000 already on staff.
</P>
<P>
   Filling these posts ain't cheap or easy. Michael Kirk, executive
director of the American Intellectual Property Law Association in
Alexandria, Va., said patent examiners must be lawyers with
advanced degrees in engineering, software or biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at the patent office in the 1980s when the first wave of
biotech patents hit, and we had to hire examiners to qualify
them,'' said Kirk, a former assistant patent commissioner. ``We
called in some industry folks and asked, `How much would we have to
pay these people?' They came up with a figure higher than the
salary of the secretary of commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; No one would argue that patents have become the ticket to
riches in our high-tech economy. And American history is replete
with stories of inventors like Thomas Edison or Alexander Graham
Bell, whose patented inventions spawned corporate giants like
General Electric and AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   But it's less well known that patents fell out of favor in the
decades between the 1940s and the 1980s. The number of patents
issued each year stagnated or grew slowly, at best.
</P>
<P>
   John Lynch, a veteran patent attorney in Menlo Park, Calif.,
said the reason was simple: The federal courts basically were
unfriendly to patent-infringement cases. Trials were argued before
federal judges, who made stingy damage awards. Even worse,
appellate courts across the nation routinely reduced awards or
dismissed infringement cases _ making patents into paper tigers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  In 1982, however, a procedural reform had far-reaching
implications for patents. The courts ordained a single group of
judges in Washington, D.C. _ the Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit _ to hear all appeals in patent cases. It became, in
essence, a mini-Supreme Court for patent law and began upholding
patents.
</P>
<P>
   This patent-friendly appeals court also helped expand the
definition of inventions to include things like strands of DNA,
software _ during the early days of the PC revolution, no one
dreamed of patenting software _ even business processes like
conducting reverse auctions over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The market got the message. Patent applications began rising in
the mid-1980s and have been ballooning ever since. The Patent
Office received 243,062 applications last year, more than twice as
many as it fielded just 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Rivette, chief executive of Aurigin Systems in Mountain
View, Calif., said the changes in patent behavior, sparked by the
court reforms, have made U.S. high-tech and biotech startups the
envy of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``When entrepreneurs are trying to raise venture capital, the
first question they get is how they expect to protect their market
from bigger competitors,'' Rivette said. ``A patent is the best
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivette's firm sells software to help companies plot their
patent strategies. He also co-authored a new book, ``Rembrandts in
the Attic,'' that explains how to make the most aggressive use of
patents.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of PATENTS1 (103643 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Rivette said that during past eras of innovation, like the rise
of the telegraph and electrical industries in the late 19th century
and the airplane and auto era in the early 20th century, patent
filings soared and commentators complained that they would thwart
progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens is that the Patent Office and the courts
eventually correct these imbalances,'' Rivette said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bruce Alberts, president of the National Academy of Sciences
and a former University of California professor, wonders if the
current patent fever differs from past outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, universities have gotten into the patent race.
They used to be ivory towers, above the commercial fray. Nowadays,
professors file patents, raise venture capital and start companies.
Alberts fears that this may encourage secrecy and inhibit the free
exchange of ideas, which traditionally has helped advance science
and innovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have patent laws for the purpose of stimulating
technological discovery,'' Alberts said. ``What we have to ask is
whether our current intellectual property policies are still
appropriate given the tremendous changes in technology.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The National Academy of Science will convene a meeting of 30
experts tomorrow at the University of California at Berkeley's
Boalt Hall to begin mulling a question that will touch the central
nerve of our knowledge-based economy: Has the patent system gone
too far?
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last decade, we've had a renaissance of technology
and prosperity in America driven in large part by patented
inventions,'' said Yale University President Richard Levin, an
economist by training. ``At the same time, there's a concern we may
have gone too far and taken too many steps to protect inventors.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  But even those who express such concerns are leery of
tinkering with a system that has become the envy of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm somewhat concerned the pendulum may have swung too far
toward valuing patents,'' said Donald Chisum, patent law professor
at Santa Clara University in Santa Clara, Calif. ``But we're
beating the socks off Europe and Japan in part because of our
venture financing system, which is directly tied to patents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hesitate about an overreaction the other way,'' Chisum
said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mets general manager Steve Phillips had wondered
Saturday why the Mets could not be the first team to come back from
three games down to win a best-of-7 playoff series. It could not be
harder, he figured, than hitting 70 home runs or pitching a perfect
game. Phillips did not factor in whether the feat _ which the
Braves failed to accomplish last year against San Diego in the
league championships _ would be any harder than completing a
marathon.
</P>
<P>
   But after nearly six hours, after nine of the 11 Mets pitchers
on the roster had made their way to the mound, after Bobby
Valentine had pinch hit for the last reliever he had left, the Mets
could actually walk home when Braves reliever Kevin McGlinchy
issued a bases-loaded walk to Todd Pratt to tie the game in the
bottom of the 15th inning and Robin Ventura, who was 1 for 18 when
he came to the plate, smashed a ball over the wall with the bases
loaded to end the game, 4-3, to force the series back to Atlanta
for a Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura was mobbed by his teammates and never made it past
second base, so he was credited with a single. Roger Cedeno scored
the winning run from third, but the rest of the base runners joined
in the celebration rather than crossing home plate.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are just the second team _ the Braves last year were
the first _ to win two games after being down 3-0 in a best-of-7
series. There is now seemingly no end to the Mets' improbable run
through the postseason. They have been nearly dead several times,
but Sunday night's resurrection _ after the Braves had scored in
the top half of the 15th off rookie reliever Octavio Dotel to take
the lead _ makes all the comebacks that came before seem minor by
comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams had numerous chances to blow the game open.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets took a 2-0 lead in the first inning on John Olerud's
home run _ he drove in all three New York runs in Game 4 and had
hit a grand slam off Maddux Sept. 29 _ but they stranded Mike
Piazza on first base with one out.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Hamilton led off the second inning with a double, but he
remained at second, as did the Braves' Eddie Perez, who led off
their half of the third with a double.
</P>
<P>
   But in the fourth inning, Atlanta's first hitter, Bret Boone,
smacked a pitch from Masato Yoshii into left field. Rickey
Henderson, at the center of a controversy over his reaction to
being replaced in Game 4, did not break back for the ball until it
was too late. It went over his head and bounced off the wall for a
double.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones then slapped a 1-1 pitch down the third-base line.
It skipped over the bag and caromed off the wall in foul territory,
scoring Boone, and then rolled back into fair territory for a
double. Brian Jordan followed with a single to left that reached
Henderson on a bounce to tie the score at 2-2. Yoshii walked Ryan
Klesko on a full count to put two runners on with none out. But
Orel Hershiser, who had last pitched Oct. 8 when he threw an inning
of relief in a loss to Arizona in the division series, relieved
Yoshii and got out of the inning without allowing the Braves to
score again.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves and the Mets, who have each had trouble scoring in
this series, then had to work out of repeated jams to keep the
score tied. In the fifth, Gerald Williams hit a one-out double, but
was stranded. In the sixth, both teams had the bases loaded with
the help of errors by the opposing first basemen, and neither team
scored because of superb defensive plays.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves stranded their three when Maddux, with one out, tried
to squeeze Klesko home from third. But Hershiser's pitch was low
and away and the bunting Maddux missed the ball. Klesko had broken
from third and was almost halfway down the line when Mike Piazza
threw to to Robin Ventura. With Klesko caught between third and
home, Ventura threw to Hershiser along the line, and he made the
tag to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had an even better chance in their half of the sixth.
Piazza, leading off, hit a grounder to third. On Jones' throw to
first, Piazza stumbled over Klesko's leg and tumbled to the ground,
but was safe when Klesko dropped the throw. Ventura struck out, but
Melvin Mora _ starting in place of the injured Roger Cedeno _
singled to right, moving Piazza to second.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Hamilton, next up, hit a hard bouncer to Klesko. He threw
to second. The throw was high and wide, pulling shortstop Walt
Weiss off the bag, and the bases were loaded. But Rey Ordonez, 1
for 16 in the series as he came to the plate, swung at the first
pitch and grounded into a double play that ended the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves threatened again in the seventh, loading the bases
against a succession of four pitchers _ Hershiser, Turk Wendell,
Dennis Cook and Pat Mahomes. Mahomes got Andruw Jones to fly out to
left to end that inning.
</P>
<P>
   Back and forth they went, each team putting runners on, each
team failing to score.
</P>
<P>
   In the Braves' eighth, Weiss hit a one-out double and Jose
Hernandez, pinch-hitting for Maddux, struck out. After Gerald
Williams was intentionally walked, John Franco _ the Mets' fifth
reliever of the game _ coaxed Keith Lockhart, who had entered the
game earlier at second base, to ground out to first.
</P>
<P>
   Now it was the Mets' turn. Olerud singled off Terry Mulholland
to start the eighth, but was left there when Piazza struck out and
Ventura, 0 for 15 in the series at this point, grounded into an
inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   Franco began the ninth by striking out Chipper Jones. Ventura
gave the Braves life when he couldn't hold onto a roller by Jordan,
which was ruled a hit. But Brian Hunter popped up when Franco threw
him a fastball on his fists and Andruw Jones struck out.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets went down in order in the ninth, sending the game to
extra innings, an appropriate way to extend a series filled with
closely contested, intrigue-filled games. There had been only one
other extra-inning game between the teams this season, and the
result was ominous for the Mets: the Braves beat them in 11 innings
on Sept. 30 and thought they were leaving the Mets for dead, two
games out of the wild-card slot with three games to play.
</P>
<P>
   That was the darkest day of the season for the Mets, the day
Hamilton admitted the season was on life support.

 &HT;    After Cuba, `El Duque' can handle Boston fans
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He has faced the angry crowds in Santiago, in Havana,
even in his home province of Villa Clara where they turned against
him. Don't ask Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez about the hard times
and angry people he will see around Fenway Park as New York's
starter tonight in Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Cuba, it used to be a little worse than here,'' Hernandez
said through translator (and Yankees first-base coach) Jose
Cardenal Sunday. ``They are very vocal, but in Cuba, it's a little
bit different. They throw tomatoes, throw rocks, throw everything
they can throw on the field. If you win, the opposing fans, they're
going to beat you any way they can. If you lose, your own fans are
going to try and kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence Boston's angry crowds, like the kind that tore into Roger
Clemens during Game 3, signify less of a challenge to Hernandez
more than any player still working the postseason. Here, at least
Hernandez is not pitching for his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think from El Duque's perspective, it's any
different,'' manager Joe Torre said. ``He pitched that game in
Cleveland last year (a 4-0 shutout win in Game 4 of the ALCS). I
mean, what's to scare him after leaving Cuba?
</P>
<P>
   ``We really don't know what size boat he came over in, but
whatever it was, it still a fact he still had to slide out of the
country and hide out somewhere and this kind of stuff. It's not the
way we came to the ballpark. I know that. So sure, this is a
different game for him.''
</P>
<P>
   His record shows it. In four career postseason starts, Hernandez
is 3-0, having allowed three runs in 30 innings (0.97 earned-run
average).
</P>
<P>
   Offerman paying off
</P>
<P>
   The season started with Boston general manager Dan Duquette
dodging pitchforks from both fans and the industry itself for
handing a monster four-year $26 million contract to journeyman
infielder Jose Offerman. This October, Duquette doesn't here a
peep.
</P>
<P>
   While John Valentin and Nomar Garciaparra have received most of
the attention for the explosiveness in Boston's order, Offerman
quietly entered Sunday's game hitting .441 (15-for-34) in the
postseason, having gone 8-for-16 in three games against the
Yankees. Furthermore, he remains a .300 hitter against New York
since coming to the American League in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never feel comfortable when you face the staff the Yankees
have,'' he said. ``Maybe it's good luck for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Re-rotating?
</P>
<P>
   Despite Clemens' dismal performance in Game 3 (two innings, five
runs), Torre said he was not giving any thought to adjusting his
current rotation. Should the ALCS reach a seventh game, Clemens
would be re-paired with Boston's Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always concerned,'' Torre said. ``The bad part about
being a starting pitcher is you don't get a chance to get back out
there until five days later. Sometimes, that's good, because when
you can get beat up like he did yesterday, it gives you a day or so
to get the fog cleared out. Then you can start thinking about your
next start.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we set the pitching up, there is no reason for me to
deviate from that.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Some perspective: Pedro Martinez's current 17-inning postseason
scoreless streak is only the 10th-longest in baseball history, tied
with Boston's Jim Lonborg. He has more than a full game to go to
catch the record holder, Christy Mathewson, who threw 27 scoreless
innings in the 1905 World Series. . . . It is taking Garciaparra
longer to get back to the field after innings when he batted. The
Red Sox shortstop is wearing two different wraps on his sore right
wrist _ one for hitting, one for fielding. Trainer Jim Rowe must
change the tape job after every at-bat.

BIOTECH FIRMS RUSHING TO PATENT GENE FRAGMENTS &HT;    By TOM ABATE
 &HT;    c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Biotech firms have sparked a controversy in
their race to discover and patent a type of gene fragment called an
expressed sequence tag.
</P>
<P>
   Genes are lengths of DNA that govern inherited traits like eye
color and influence our susceptibility to many diseases. More than
100,000 genes reside in the nucleus of every cell.
</P>
<P>
   But each cell may need only a few genes. The rest simply sit
dormant in the nucleus. When a cell activates a gene, scientists
say the cell expresses it. An expressed sequence tag, or EST, is
therefore a short length of DNA that does something in a given
cell.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists view ESTs as flashing lights that indicate which of
our genes may be important for cancer, heart disease or other
maladies. They reason that a gene expressed in a heart or prostate
cell must be important, otherwise it would be dormant.
</P>
<P>
   With this in mind, San Francisco Bay Area biotech firms like
Incyte Pharmaceuticals and Hyseq are vying with East Coast rivals
like Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Celera Genomics and Human Genome
Sciences to identify _ and patent _ ESTs as fast as they can.
</P>
<P>
   ``The value of EST patents is that they allow you to develop
diagnostic marker kits,'' said Incyte chief executive Roy
Whitfield. Patent holders would sell such kits to drug developers,
which would use the kits to zero in on genes of specific interest
and avoid getting lost in the genome maze.
</P>
<P>
   But some influential scientists think that ESTs should not be
patentable. This stems partly from the way ESTs are discovered. The
companies in the EST race run genetic samples through
DNA-sequencing machines. The machines automatically identify
expressed genes. But this process doesn't reveal what a gene does _
only that it does something.
</P>
<P>
   ``This involves very little effort and almost no originality,''
said Bruce Alberts, president of the National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   David Botstein, chairman of the genetics department at Stanford
University and former scientific director at Genentech, said EST
patents could retard drug development. EST patent holders could
demand royalties from drug discovery firms, which might discourage
them from doing the work needed to fully understand a gene's
function and to use this knowledge to produce a drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is dangerous to go into a situation where you have these
potential blocking patents hanging over you,'' Botstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Incyte's Whitfield scoffs at such concerns. ``That is foolish.
It's a bogeyman that has been invented.'' He said it is in the
self-interest of EST patent holders to license broadly their
discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   But even some of his competitors in the EST race question
whether these fragmentary strands should be patented. Lewis Gruber,
chief executive of Hyseq, said he only applied for EST patents
after the Patent Office said it would look favorably upon such
applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone else is asking for it and you don't, you don't want
to shortchange your shareholders just because you didn't think it
was right,'' Gruber said.
</P>
<P>
   So, like its competitors, Hyseq is filing EST patent
applications. About 10,000 such applications have reached the
Patent Office thus far.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have issued three (EST) patents,'' said Todd Dickinson,
acting commissioner of patents and trademarks.
</P>
<P>
   That's hardly a blistering approval rate, given that the first
EST patent applications were filed in the early 1990s. The
controversy surrounding ESTs has prompted the Patent Office to move
even more slowly than usual to issue these patents.
</P>
<P>
   But the office recently revised the 3-inch-thick book that
guides its patent examiners in reviewing EST claims, and Todd said
more EST patents ``will issue in due course.''
</P>
<P>
   But he rejected suggestions that the Patent Office will cause
trouble if it issues many patents on gene fragments. ``Other than
speculative concern, no one has shown any harm,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But San Francisco patent attorney Kevin Bastian wonders what
will happen when all those pent-up EST patents begin to issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very good chance for people to have conflicting
claims and not know it,'' he said. Bastian said two companies could
find different fragments of the same gene and win competing patents
_ something they'll discover only when they both try to enforce a
patent on the same gene.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be a big mess that the courts will have to
straighten out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the players vie to increase their EST stakes. ``The
more claims, the better,'' said Hyseq's Gruber. ``At the end of the
day, they may be valuable as bargaining chips.''

Los Angeles: Norwegian and Italian. With large projects like MiniMed's, the Santa Monica, Calif.,
office of Princeton, N.J.-based Berlitz GlobalNET -- MiniMed's
partner on the project -- tends to go to its offices abroad.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The manual, which took about a month to complete, went on a
whirlwind tour of the globe, with the French portion of the project
alone going from Sylmar to Santa Monica to Paris and then out to
translators and editors in France, then back to Santa Monica and
Sylmar, then back to France for further refinement and finally back
to the client.
</P>
<P>
   Other portions of the MiniMed project were routed through
Berlitz's bureaus in Rome; Sindelfingen, Germany; Madrid, Spain;
Bergen, Norway; and Amsterdam in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   In translation, it is a cardinal rule that a translator be a
native speaker of the target language. In other words, a translator
for a project from English to Mandarin Chinese should be a native
speaker of Mandarin, not English.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with translation by a nonnative speaker,'' said
Monica Matulich, company spokeswoman for Cyrsh Technologies
Corporation, a Woodland Hills-based translation software developer,
``is that they translate according to the way they learned the
language in school, which is not necessarily the colloquial or best
usage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've only learned it as a second language, no matter what
your proficiency level, there's going to be room for error. It's
often a question of the book vs. the real world.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation software, like Cyrsh's, may be suitable for some
types of translations, but the technology has historically been
riddled with problems.
</P>
<P>
   With a sentence like ``Inspect the filter for wear and tear,''
the computer might translate it to mean you should inspect the
filter for wear and then (ITAL) tear (END ITAL) it.
</P>
<P>
   Matulich says Cyrsh Technologies has overcome those problems.
</P>
<P>
   Its system, she said, is different in that it translates not
word for word but based on context and is 100 percent tolerant of
typographical errors and spelling mistakes. The company says its
system can search, retrieve and translate text to and from 28
languages.
</P>
<P>
   By the first quarter of next year, the company expects to have
its first module available. It will allow users to send e-mail in
their native languages and recipients to receive and read it in the
language of choice.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Liller, national accounts manager for Thousand
Oaks-based translation firm Network Omni, is skeptical of the
technology. Network Omni uses human translators for all levels of
translation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take the term `hydrostatic transmission,' '' said Liller.
``You could translate the term into a hundred languages. Whatever
you store in the computer will be accurate. But in the context of a
phrase, the syntax will often be wrong. You could end up with a
sentence like, `This car a hydrostatic transmission equipped is
with.'
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have two or three pages of text like this, it will read
like one of those glove compartment manuals that Toyota came out
with decades ago,'' said Liller, who handles translation and
interpreting for clients like Disney, Warner Bros., Hertz and Blue
Cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the area of advertising,'' Liller said, ``how can a
computer ever begin to understand a phrase like `The Big Apple goes
bananas'? It's going to be a lot easier to translate from scratch
using old-fashioned elbow grease.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing translation companies do agree on is the need to
assemble client-specific glossaries. Large accounts get their own
word lists for consistency's sake. If, for example, the term
``repetition cycle'' appears in one version of a manufacturer's
product, it must appear in all subsequent versions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been preaching this for 20 years,'' Liller said. ``The
more you know about a certain industry, the more knowledgeable you
become about its specific terms. It's important to develop a
business glossary before you start the translation project. You
want the accuracy, and you want the client to approve the terms. A
client may feed you 200 phrases that are common in their industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the translator has the accurate terminology, he or she
has the basics to begin a quality translation.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the question of the translator having expertise in
a given field, beyond a mere proficiency in two or more languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be a good translator in one area is important. All
translators should have an expertise,'' Baugham said. ``You may
speak a language. I know English; I grew up here. But I may not
know engineering terminology in English.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the best of intentions, gaffes occur. Liller said one of
his favorite gaffes was for the advertising tag line ``Pepsi Comes
Alive.''
</P>
<P>
   It was mistakenly translated in China as ``Pepsi comes out of
the grave.''

BEHIND-THE-SCENES FIRMS KEEP GLOBAL BUSINESS SPEAKING SAME
LANGUAGE

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Somewhere near Paris, a French-speaking
translator with an expertise in medical technology awaits a
project.
</P>
<P>
   Seven thousand miles away, in L.A.'s San Fernando Valley, the
marketing department of a medical device manufacturer decides it is
time to have a 28,000-word user's manual translated into a
half-dozen languages, one of which is French.
</P>
<P>
   The two are brought together by a New Jersey-based company with
an expertise in project management, product localization and
translation software, and a long list of worldwide offices.
</P>
<P>
   As telecommunications advances connect the global marketplace,
companies that can successfully market their products to individual
foreign cultures should prosper. Behind this global expansion, the
language services sector plays a hidden, yet crucial, role that is
growing as quickly as the world is shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Translation is absolutely vital to international trade,'' said
Vance Baugham, vice president of trade development for the World
Trade Center Association of Los Angeles-Long Beach. ``Good
translation expresses the idea and is sensitive to the nuances of a
foreign culture and its customs.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the advent of the Internet, English has become more
prevalent. But when it comes to the bottom line, translation and
interpreting become a key component.''
</P>
<P>
   To define a few terms: ``translation'' is most commonly used to
signify adaptations of the written word, ``interpreting'' denotes
verbal interactions, while ``localizing'' means changing text and
marketing approach with an emphasis not only on language but on the
target culture itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like everyone is endeavoring to reverse the Tower
of Babel,'' said Baugham, who is also trade manager for the Port of
Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley Trade Office. ``Languages can
facilitate communication, but they can also cause an extraordinary
amount of confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   The combined market worldwide for commercial translation, which
includes such diverse services as written translation, multimedia
adaptation, interpreting, translation software development and
language training, is estimated between $8 billion and $10 billion
with a 20 percent annual growth rate. The dollar value for
English-Japanese translation alone is thought to be well over $1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   But those figures may be low.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rubric `business translation,' '' said San Pedro-based
business and technology translator Stephen Franke, ``is hard to
quantify as a separate, stand-alone cost. Firms tend to include
translation costs in their marketing and advertising budgets,''
making it hard to break out exact numbers.
</P>
<P>
   In the Los Angeles region's $181 billion in international trade,
language services play no less a part, with its No. 1 and No. 2
trade partners being Japan and China respectively. Every piece of
software, industrial machinery, every replacement part, catalog,
repair guide, entertainment video and point-of-purchase display,
every marketing plan, bid description and annual report will
involve some degree of adaptation if it is to be targeted to a
foreign market.
</P>
<P>
   But the translation and localization industry, according to a
report by the international marketing research firm Ovum, is highly
fragmented, with no player holding more than 1 percent of the
market worldwide. According to conservative estimates, there are
about 20,000 translation companies, agencies and service providers
in the United States, including free-lancers.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the medical device maker, MiniMed Inc. of Sylmar,
Calif., the target languages for its insulin pump's manual were
Spanish, German, French, Dutch, Swedish, Norwegian and Italian.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When cross-cultural gaffes are discussed in
corporate boardrooms, few come up as frequently as one leading up
to the World Cup of Soccer in Los Angeles in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   It occurred when McDonald's and Coca-Cola decided to reprint the
flags of each of the 24 countries that had qualified for the
tournament _ soccer's great quadrennial spectacle _ on pieces of
throwaway packaging.
</P>
<P>
   The hitch: The green-and-white Saudi flag contains the Koran's
sacred passage, ``There is no God but Allah, and Mohammed is his
Prophet.''
</P>
<P>
   Muslims in Spain, where the Coke cans first appeared, and those
in Britain, where McDonald's first released the carryout bags
bearing the sacred passage, were outraged.
</P>
<P>
   It was bad enough, said Muslim leaders, that the holy
inscription was being used to sell drinks and hamburgers. But that
the image was then crumpled up and thrown away was intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the Saudi flag contains the Muslim Shahada (the Islamic
declaration of faith), the Saudi government !ital!never!off! allows
its use for commercial or promotional activities, or in any way
that is not consistent with the respect due to the Shahada,'' said
a statement released by the Saudi government at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Another example of expediency winning out over proper planning,
said William Axtell, author of ``Do's and Taboos of Using English
Around the World'' (John Wiley &AMP; Sons), was General Motor's snafu
in Belgium, when the automotive giant translated the marketing
tagline ``Body by Fisher'' into Flemish to mean ``Corpse by
Fisher.''
</P>
<P>
   Other gaffes have occurred when names !ital!weren't!off!
translated.
</P>
<P>
   ``A telephone system known as Chat Box became, in French, the
!ital!Cat!off! Box (since !ital!chat!off! is the French word for
cat),'' said Axtell, a former vice president for worldwide
marketing at the Parker Pen Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parker Pen's well-known Jotter ballpoint pen could not be
marketed with the name in Latin countries because that word also
happened to be slang for jockstrap.''

LEXICON PROVES HE'S NO COUNTERFEIT

<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ A Daily Racing Form handicapper attached an
unkind word to a colt named Lexicon this week, dismissing him as a
``counterfeit'' contender for next month's Breeders' Cup Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   Lexicon issued his reply on Saturday by beating heavily favored
Kona Gold in the Ancient Title Handicap at Santa Anita. A few
minutes later the 4-year-old's trainer had his say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's ever claimed this is the next Man O'War, but he's a
good, consistent horse,'' Richard Mandella said in the winner's
circle. ``The word `counterfeit' really offended me. I can tell you
some horses who are counterfeit. He's not one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Handicapper Brad Free had written, ``Only one of (Lexicon's) 18
starts remotely resembles a Breeders' Cup-quality effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it's two of 19.
</P>
<P>
   Lexicon and jockey Kent Desormeaux blazed 6 furlongs in 1:07.84
to break the record for the Ancient Title, the race that produced
Breeders' Cup Sprint winners Cardmania (1993) and Elmhurst (1997).
Lexicon ($8.40) opened a clear lead with quarter-mile splits of
21.92 and 44.16, was caught by Kona Gold and Alex Solis at the top
of the stretch but pulled away from the opponent who'd been
sidelined since March.
</P>
<P>
   The Nov. 6 Breeders' Cup Sprint at Gulfstream Park in Florida
will include a strong contingent from California, with Lexicon,
Kona Gold and Regal Thunder aiming to join Forestry, Big Jag, Enjoy
the Moment and Son of a Pistol in facing the best of the East and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of Team California looks like this after three weekends
of preps for the eight-race, $13 million Breeders' Cup card:
</P>
<P>
   __ Classic: Budroyale, General Challenge and Old Trieste, 1-2-3
in Saturday's Goodwood; and Woodward-Jockey Club Gold Cup winner
River Keen.
</P>
<P>
   __ Distaff: Three-year-old Silverbulletday; Spinster winner
Keeper Hill; narrow Lady's Secret winner Manistique.
</P>
<P>
   __ Turf: Sayarshan and Bonapartiste, 3-4 behind Breeders'
Cup-ineligible horses in the Oak Tree Turf Championship.
</P>
<P>
   __ Mile: Silic and Brave Act, 1-2 in Saturday's Oak Tree Mile;
1998 Mile runner-up Hawksley Hill; Shadwell Mile winner Kirkwall;
Ladies Din, who, like Silic, is Julio Canani-trained; and
Ramona-winning mare Tuzla.
</P>
<P>
   __ Filly and Mare Turf: Yellow Ribbon winner Spanish Fern;
Canani's Caffe Latte.
</P>
<P>
   __ Juvenile: Dixie Union, likely favorite Forest Camp and Anees,
1-2-3 in the Norfolk; Captain Steve, winner of the the Breeders'
Futurity at Keeneland; California Sires winner Hugh Hefner.
</P>
<P>
   __ Juvenile Fillies: Heavy favorite Chilukki, Abby Girl and
Spain, 1-2-3 in the Oak Leaf.

 CUSTOMERS LINING UP TO TOUR SPACE  &HT;     By TERRY NAGEL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ Move over, Neil Armstrong. Space tourism is about
to take off.
<P>
   Two U.S. tour operators are accepting reservations on suborbital
flights that are expected to lift off as soon as 2002. The
21/2-hour trips to the edge of space will be the culmination of
weeklong packages that immerse participants in space jargon,
subject them to G-forces, familiarize them with state-of-the-art
equipment and teach them to do triple somersaults at zero gravity.
</P>
<P>
   The trips aren't cheap, but they're selling briskly. About 145
people already have made substantial deposits or paid in full for
seven-day excursions to space with either Zegrahm Expeditions of
Seattle, which charges $98,000, or Space Adventures of Alexandria,
Va., which charges $90,000. The companies say thousands more have
expressed interest in going.
</P>
<P>
   Space travel for average citizens, which seemed imminent when
Neil Armstrong walked on the moon in 1969, never got beyond the
talking stage until a few years ago, when private companies started
figuring out how to make it happen. NASA didn't help; the agency
doesn't believe that its mission is to help taxpayers go to space.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology to take civilians up to space and back has
existed for a long time. It's just basically proving there is a
market and getting investors to put up money to build vehicle
systems and getting regulatory organizations like the (Federal
Aviation Administration) to grant licenses,'' said Scott
Fitzsimmons, vice president of Zegrahm.
</P>
<P>
   The current passion for exotic trips is adding to the momentum.
The Adventure Travel Society in Englewood, Colo., reported in June
that Americans spend $110 billion on adventure travel every year.
Those in search of the latest and greatest adventure spend tens of
thousands of dollars on unusual trips like climbing Mt. Everest,
diving in a submersible vessel beneath the ocean to see the Titanic
or visiting Antarctica aboard an icebreaker.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by NASA's slowness in opening space to private
citizens, some space enthusiasts formed a foundation in 1996 which
is offering a $10 million prize to jump-start space tourism. Even
former astronauts have joined this effort: Byron Lichtenberg, who
flew on Space Shuttle missions 9 and 45 is one of the founders of
the X Prize Foundation. (He's also a senior adviser to Space
Adventures, along with ex-astronauts Buzz Aldrin, Owen Garriott,
Robert ``Hoot'' Gibson, Norman Thagard, Kathryn Thornton and
Charles Walker.)
</P>
<P>
   The X Prize will be awarded to the team that designs the first
private spaceship that carries three humans to a suborbital
altitude of 100 kilometers (62 miles _ the beginning of space as
defined by the Federation Aeronautique Internationale) and then
does it again within two weeks. All teams must be privately
financed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suborbital'' means traveling high enough to enter space but
not fast enough to go into orbit. It's the same type of flight that
the first American in space, Alan Shepard, took in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   The prize money is coming from private sources, most of whom
wish to be anonymous. Peter Diamandis, chairman and president of
the X Prize Foundation in St. Louis, said his group has raised more
than $5 million and expects to raise the rest within six months.
Part of the funding is coming from X Prize Platinum Visa cards
issued by First USA.
</P>
<P>
   The X Prize is modeled after the Orteig Prize, the $25,000 purse
that Charles Lindbergh won in 1927 (worth about $226,000 in today's
dollars). That prize inspired nine attempts to cross the Atlantic
Ocean before Lindbergh, an underdog who was berated as a ``flying
fool'' in the press, succeeded. Diamandis credits the Orteig Prize
and other early aviation prizes with paving the way to commercial
air travel.
</P>
<P>
   One of the X Prize board members is Erik Lindbergh, 34, grandson
of the famous aviator. Although he's trained as a commercial pilot
and flight instructor, he now works for two nonprofit organizations
and has a woodworking business on Bainbridge Island, Wash., where
he makes sculptures of rockets and planets. He signed on with the X
Prize Foundation, he said, because ``we need to have an economic
incentive to develop space.''
</P>
<P>
   Zegrahm Expeditions and Space Adventures aren't registered in
the competition, but both have formed alliances with some of the
contestants, which primarily are rocketmakers with a wide range of
experience. Fifteen teams have registered so far, and a 16th team _
the first from Russia _ probably will be announced next month.
Eleven teams are American, two are from England, one is from
Germany, and one is from South America.
</P>
<P>
   Diamandis won't speculate on who's ahead. ``The people who are
the front-runners today may not be the winners tomorrow,'' he said.
``About one-third of them are building hardware and flying
prototypes, a third have designs and are busy raising money, and a
third are trying to figure out how to get going.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the contestants is Vela Technology Development Inc. of
Vienna, Va., which has designed a two-stage Space Cruiser with a
reusable launch vehicle. Zegrahm is planning on using this craft.
</P>
<P>
   Space Adventures has partnerships with five of the X Prize
contestants: Pioneer Rocketplane of Ann Arbor, Mich., whose
Pathfinder vehicle uses both jet and rocket engines; Kelly Space
and Technology Inc. of San Bernardino, Calif., which will use a 747
jet to tow its Eclipse Astroliner to about 20,000 feet before
igniting rocket engines to climb to space; Rotary Rocket of Redwood
City, Calif., which already has unveiled its Roton, which takes off
vertically like a conventional rocket and lands using helicopter
blades; Scaled Composites Inc. of Mohave, Calif., which is
designing a two-stage vehicle using a composite aircraft as a
launch platform; and Bristol Spaceplanes of England, which flew a
scale model of its one-stage jet- and rocket-powered Ascender this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever gets there first is the one we'll use,'' said Emilene
Paat-Dahlstrom, director of programs for Space Adventures.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Space Adventures and Zegrahm are offering earthbound
adventures for space wannabes that allow them to experience
weightlessness, neutral buoyancy and g-loads at the Gagarin
Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City, Russia. The facility is the
Russian equivalent of the Kennedy Space Center. All Russian
cosmonauts train there, as well as astronauts from 17 other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Zegrahm has signed up about 20 people for its seven-day training
program, at $14,950 each, and will take the first group over on
October 24. Space Adventures already has taken individuals to
Russia for various components of the training, such as a
zero-gravity flight ($5,500) and a ride in the cockpit of a Russian
MiG-25 military jet ($11,900).
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 3 of SPACE18 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Russia has a different attitude than NASA about training
civilians for space travel because the survival of its space
program depends on raising revenue. That's why cosmonauts floated a
giant Pepsi can outside the Mir space station and why Russia
recently agreed to put the Pizza Hut logo on a rocket.
</P>
<P>
   But NASA is beginning to shift its emphasis. NASA Administrator
Dan Goldin announced in late September that the agency wants
private industry to take over activities in the Earth's orbit, such
as the International Space Station, so NASA can get back to
exploring deep space &LR;  _ that is, establishing a moon base and going
on to Mars and beyond &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   NASA also participated in a two-year study with the Space
Transportation Association that concluded that serious national
attention should be given to the creation of a large in-space
tourism industry. The report, which was released in March 1998,
noted that Americans currently spend about $1 billion on visits to
space museums, space camps and other space tourism activities on
terra firma &LR;  _ a small portion of the $400 billion that U.S.
tourism takes in annually &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Bob Haltermann, executive director of STA's Space Travel &AMP;
Tourism Division in Arlington, Va., spends his days trying to make
space tourism happen. His nonprofit group has members who are
mostly rocketmakers; former astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Scott
Carpenter sit on the board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Haltermann recently cited a 1996 survey in which 1,200 people
were asked what they would be willing to pay for a two-week
vacation aboard a space shuttle that had all the amenities of a
cruise ship. STA concluded that the space-tourism market was close
to $1 trillion, or about $30 billion per year for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Penn, a senior project engineer with the Aerospace Corp. in
El Segundo, Calif., calls space tourism ``a chicken-and-egg kind of
problem.'' After studying the feasibility of space-tourism launch
systems, he concluded, ``To get people to fly, you need to get the
cost down, but to get the cost down, you need to get people to
fly.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``The trick is to design vehicles that are very
operable and very reliable that are designed for a very low
incremental cost per flight _ meaning they won't wear out soon and
they can turn around rapidly to fly again.''
</P>
<P>
   And when that happens, average citizens _ not just rich people _
will be able to rocket into space.

TYSON DOESN'T BELONG AMONG GREATEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one can question Mike Tyson's ability to stir the masses.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, even though it's clear he's nothing like the fighter
he once was, he remains boxing's biggest draw. His latest comeback
fight, against Orlin Norris on Saturday, will garner very high
ratings. Guaranteed. Clearly, he's among the all-time greats in
terms of marketability.
</P>
<P>
   However, where does he rank in terms of his BOXING ability?
</P>
<P>
   Some insist his awesome run through the heavyweight division in
the 1980s proves he's among the greatest ever. Others say he was
overrated from the start and the illusion was exposed later in his
career.
</P>
<P>
   Where does the truth lie? Somewhere in between.
</P>
<P>
   This much is certain: Tyson was far and away the best
heavyweight during his first stint as champion, from Nov. 22, 1986
_ when he stopped Trevor Berbick to win the WBC title _ to Feb. 11,
1990 _ when Buster Douglas did the impossible.
</P>
<P>
   His opponents, many of them petrified, were utterly unable to
cope with his unique combination of speed, power and ferocity, the
attributes that so thrilled boxing fans.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe he was the greatest fighter in history the night he
knocked out a terrified Michael Spinks in 90 seconds in 1988 and
they have an argument.
</P>
<P>
   For this, Tyson deserves credit. What more can be asked of a
champion than to decimate the best fighters in his division?
</P>
<P>
   That said, let's examine his division at that time and ask: Who
did he beat?
</P>
<P>
   Here's the list of his title defenses: Bonecrusher Smith,
Pinklon Thomas, Tony Tucker, Tyrell Biggs, Larry Holmes, Tony
Tubbs, Michael Spinks, Frank Bruno, Carl Williams and Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   Not inspiring, huh?
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Holmes and Spinks, these fighters are
forgettable. And even Holmes and Spinks can't be considered
significant benchmarks because Holmes was old (38) and Spinks a
natural light heavyweight when they met the young Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   How would he have fared against a young Foreman? A young Liston?
A young Frazier? Not well by many estimations.
</P>
<P>
   Again, give him his due: Until Douglas, he beat those who were
put in front of him. However, his level of opposition doesn't help
his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Douglas fight and what followed is what MOST
adversely affects his place in history. He seemed to be unbeatable
until that night in Tokyo. SEEMED. That was the illusion.
</P>
<P>
   Sonny Liston, who had Tyson-like power, also seemed to be
unbeatable at one time. The same goes for George Foreman. And then
they met a guy by the name of Ali and it was clear they were as
human as anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Like Tyson, their careers were never the same after that first
defeat. Today, they are viewed as very good heavyweights but not in
the same class as the Dempseys or Louises or Alis.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson? Same thing. In his last 12 fights, including Douglas,
he's 9-3 and was knocked out twice.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas and then Holyfield (twice) proved that if you're not
afraid of him, don't stand in one place too long and have some
power, Tyson can be had.
</P>
<P>
   It happened three times, or at least 2{ times if you don't want
to count the ear-biting fight as a complete entity. That's a
pattern.
</P>
<P>
   However, here's an important question: Would this theory have
applied when Tyson was at his best? Probably.
</P>
<P>
   The best evidence we have is the Douglas fight.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Tyson had started his decline. His personal problems and
complacency certainly contributed to his downfall. It was then that
his bob-and-weave, punches-in-bunches style began to evolve into a
more simple, less effective brand of slugging.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Tyson was only 23 when he fought Douglas. 23!
Any way you look at it, at that age, he was at least NEAR his
prime.
</P>
<P>
   And look what Douglas, an inspired journeyman, did to Tyson that
night? He beat him up.
</P>
<P>
   Marciano never lost. Muhammad Ali wasn't beat up until very late
his career, when Holmes did it. Louis was beat up by Max Schmeling
as a youngster but came back to build arguably the greatest career
of any heavyweight. Holmes wasn't beat up until he was decrepit.
Foreman and Frazier were beat up but only by exceptional fighters.
</P>
<P>
   And, remember, Tyson was beat up THREE times. Holyfield pummeled
him in their unforgettable first fight and the second appeared to
be headed in the same direction when Tyson decided to take the
fight into his own mouth. And Holyfield did it when he was 34 and
35, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   That's three maulings before the age of 31 by a mediocre fighter
and an aging champion. Is that a great heavyweight?
</P>
<P>
   OK, again, Tyson's personal problems were key factors. When
one's life is falling apart, when one is in and out of prison, it's
monumentally difficult to focus on boxing. That's obvious.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is we're left to judge him by what he has done in the
ring. There are no ifs and mighta-beens when determining anyone's
impact.
</P>
<P>
   And, just as important, many boxers and other athletes have had
to deal with personal difficulties and have overcome them to
maintain a high level of excellence. Tyson hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Is that not one measure of greatness?
</P>
<P>
   Today, at 33, Tyson is no longer a terror in the ring. If he
fights Holyfield again or, say, Lennox Lewis for another world
championship, he likely would be an underdog. Just as likely, he
would lose.
</P>
<P>
   So we're left to judge him on the past, a past that includes an
impressive run against mediocre opposition over three-plus years
and a nondescript career beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   Would Tyson at his best be able to compete with the greatest
heavyweights in history? Possibly. Is he among the greatest when
his entire career is examined? No way.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tyson was a very good fighter but never a great one.
</P>
<P>
   __ Vargas' day: Interesting timing.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Vargas of Oxnard, whose demolition of Raul Marquez drew
nationwide raves, was named Fighter of the Year at the World Boxing
Hall of Fame induction ceremonies on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it could be the last time he's invited.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas faces jail time if he's convicted of pending assault
charges, although his lawyers believe charges will be dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if he doesn't stay out of trouble, he'll never realize
his immense potential and return to the Hall for what really
counts: induction.
</P>
<P>
   __ Inductees: Boxers inducted into the Hall were former WBA
bantamweight champion Khaosai Galaxy, one of the most dominating
little men of the 1980s; former lightweight champ Ismael Laguna,
whose list of opponents reads like a Hall of Fame; Jose Luis
Ramirez, who had a record of 102-9, with 82 knockouts; and Los
Angeles resident Joey Barnum, a lightweight contender in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   Among those inducted in the expanded category were Bruce Tramp,
one of the most significant matchmakers of his generation, and
referee Larry Rozadilla.
</P>
<P>
   __ Correction: The network on which the Nov. 6 Joe Calzaghe-Omar
Sheika fight will be televised was incorrect in last week's column.
The fight will be broadcast on Showtime.
</P>
<P>
   Calzaghe, from England, is the WBO super middleweight champion. &QL;

 THE BUSINESS POSSIBILITIES OF SPACE  &HT;     By TERRY NAGEL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Lots of business opportunities await the
conquerors of space. Peter Diamandis of the X Prize Foundation
predicted, ``The first trillionaires will be made in space.
Everything that we hold valuable on the planet _ mineral resources,
land, energy _ is available in infinite quantities in space.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, a nickel-iron asteroid measuring half a
kilometer in diameter would be worth $25 trillion in platinum-group
metals at today's prices.
</P>
<P>
   As the price of space flights drops, due to reusable vehicles
flying more often, other benefits might include:
</P>
<P>
   --Rocket mail. Packages could be delivered on the same day
anywhere in the world. Diamandis said Federal Express already has
pledged to make this service available when it's feasible.
Companies even could offer ``yesterday delivery'' of packages on
spaceships that cross the international date line and deliver them
in an earlier time zone.
</P>
<P>
   --Speedier travel. Passengers could circle the world in 11/2
hours and fly between any two points in 45 minutes, according to
Jay Penn of the Aerospace Corp. in El Segundo, Calif. ``But it
would still take four days to get your luggage,'' he joked. Penn
said suborbital flights eventually will be comparable in price to
flights on commercial aircraft for long-range trips.
</P>
<P>
   --Cheaper telecommunications. Satellites carrying gear that
enables beepers, television signals and ATM transfers to go through
would get cheaper. Instead of costing about $10,000 per pound of
payload, they could would drop to one-tenth or, in time, down to
one-hundredth of that cost.
</P>
<P>
   --Medical and scientific breakthroughs. ``In a nongravity
environment,'' said Penn, ``there would be the capability to
manufacture specialized materials, designer molecules and designer
drugs.'' He explained that materials can be electrically separated
more easily in space because the gravitational forces are much
lower. And there's a bonus for silicon users: ``You can grow very
large crystals that are stronger than those on Earth,'' Penn said.

SPORTS COLUMN: DESPITE SLUMPS AND BRUISES, METS FIND WAY TO WIN
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With all of New York holding on to their MetroCards
in anticipation of a Subway Series, the New York Mets fought for
their lives in a persistent drizzle Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   They held off disaster time and again, but then again, this has
been their style over this exciting but turbulent season.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, they prevailed. In a classic game _ for length, for
significance, for frustration and ultimately for joy _ the Mets
beat the Atlanta Braves, 4-3, in 15 innings, to prolong a season
that may only just be getting interesting.
</P>
<P>
   The top half of everybody's scorecard was much more cluttered
than the bottom. All the hieroglyphics on the top half indicated
the desperate hours of the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the heroes who had carried them through the summer were
having their problems. Their catcher, Mike Piazza, was reeling from
injuries. Their third baseman, Robin Ventura _ who would drive in
the winning run, with a bases-loaded hit that went over the wall
but became a one-run single when he and others were mobbed on the
basepaths _ was also battered, mired in a dreadful slump.
</P>
<P>
   Their left fielder, Rickey Henderson, was recovering from what
was described a few days ago as ``flu-like symptoms,'' and he was
also suffering a Rickey-like funk about being called out of left
field on Saturday night on a double switch in the lineup that had
not been relayed to him.
</P>
<P>
   Did Rickey threaten to quit the team? Were his teammates
disgusted with him? This is merely part of their charm.
</P>
<P>
   This is how they have endured the intrigues and psychodramas of
the Bobby Valentine regime. The players and the fans witnessed the
Mets' management virtually taunt Valentine 55 games into the season
by dismissing three of his coaches, as if to see what he might do
about it. Just to be ornery, Valentine stuck it out.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets also stuck it out through a seven-game slump in the
final two weeks of the season. Valentine added to his own troubles
by volunteering the observation that if the Mets did not get into
the playoffs that he ``probably should not be back.'' He parsed it
and deconstructed it, giving himself room to come back, but there
remains an air of impermanence to him.
</P>
<P>
   It is amazing that the Mets came back at all, but on a
sun-dappled afternoon, only two weeks ago, they clawed their way
into a playoff, which they won, and then they won their first
series with Arizona. It has been ``Perils of Pauline'' all along.
But as the rain fell, the Mets were still extant.
</P>
<P>
   The game was a microcosm of their entire season. They started
with their sturdy Japanese import, Masato Yoshii, who said: ``This
is way too late in the season now to change myself. So I just have
to go up there and do the best that I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii lasted into the fourth inning and was replaced by Orel
Hershiser, who 11 years before had terrorized the Mets in the 1988
league series. His manager at the time, Tommy Lasorda, loved to
introduce Hershiser to the press as the Bulldog, because of
Hershiser's scrunched 1950s hall-monitor smile that belied the
existence of an inner bulldog.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser remains a bulldog, willing himself to keep playing at
the age of 41, because what else could be as much fun as playing
ball? He probably accepted the fourth as a challenge, one of those
Braves innings with so many marks to indicate myriad runners
clogging up the bases. He entered with two men on base and got
three straight outs.
</P>
<P>
   But Hershiser's true bulldog moment came in the sixth, another
of those crowded-scorecard innings. An error and two walks loaded
the bases with one out. Greg Maddux struck out bunting, and burly
Ryan Klesko was caught down the line. Mike Piazza ran Klesko back
toward third and made a relatively high, premature toss to Ventura.
Klesko bolted home.
</P>
<P>
   Guarding home plate was the Bulldog himself, a willowy senior
citizen _ but also a man who had once played defense and left wing
for a Philadelphia Flyers Junior A hockey team. He has known a bit
of contact in his sport life.
</P>
<P>
   If Klesko could dislodge the ball, the Braves would be ahead by
a run, and the potential would be there for the season to go down
and out quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Klesko steamed home. Hershiser caught the toss from Ventura.
Klesko came in standing up, threw an elbow sideways, nothing dirty.
Hershiser planted the ball in his glove, stuck his right hand in
the glove, and braced himself and made the tag. The Bulldog held
on.
</P>
<P>
   The longer the game went, the worse it got for Piazza. He
stumbled over first base in the sixth inning, crumpling into a heap
near the feet of a solicitous Mookie Wilson, the first-base coach.
In the 12th inning he took a foul tip to the body and the umpire
kindly stalled a few extra seconds.

<P>
   Or this millennium.
</P>
<P>
   So don't. Keep your head in the game if you must, but don't
strap a helmet onto it and stand behind that offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   Find a spot for him right now at the '99 retirement home, where
he and John Elway can sit around in the big leather chairs, laugh
at their former teams' pratfalls and remember the good ol' days _

   __ You know there's gonna be some nitwit who decides to ``just

</P>
<P>
   __ And let's dispel this predominant theory that L.A. continues
to get the best national NFL games each week on TV because we don't
have a team _ what's your definition of ``best''?
</P>
<P>
   To the networks, L.A. has been typecast as a Rams-Raiders-49ers
area of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday provided another example.
</P>
<P>
   CBS had seven games from which to choose, and the one we got was
Oakland at Buffalo, along with 14 percent of the country.
Meanwhile, 46 percent saw Miami at New England _ which this week's
Sports Illustrated touts as ``Don't Miss'' in its TV promo _ and
had CBS' A-team announcers of Greg Gumbel and Phil Simms.
</P>
<P>
   Fox had a doubleheader for us. Of the three games available at
10 a.m., we saw St. Louis at Atlanta, as did 20 percent of the
country. The Minnesota-Detroit game went to 47 percent. Fox offered
two games in the 1 p.m. slot. We saw Carolina at San Francisco
along with 18 percent of the country. The rest (77 percent) saw
John Madden and Pat Summerall doing the Green Bay-Denver contest. .

   __ ``When Pride Still Mattered: A Life of Vince Lombardi'' by

<P>
   __ Someone remind Lenny ``The Buffer'' Dykstra that his car-wash

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   After his match ended, this massive dark man walked through the
white hot sand toward the ocean to cool off from the sweltering
late afternoon sun. After going out to where the waves finally
broke above his knees, he reached his arms over his head and dived
into the current like some great serpent.
</P>
<P>
   The sight was awesome.
</P>
<P>
   But thinking about it again, more incredible was that once he
reached a certain distance out, for the longest time it looked as
if he was walking on top of the water.

mystical.

 THEY'LL LEAVE THE STARLIGHT ON FOR YOU  &HT;     By TERRY NAGEL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Some people believe that the key to creating
interest in space travel is offering travelers a destination rather
than just a suborbital flight.
</P>
<P>
   The Space Island Group of West Covina, Calif., says it could
build a large space resort within seven years. It would keep the
cost down by using ``space junk'' _ external fuel tanks discarded
by space shuttles. Sketches of its wheellike design look like
something out of the movie ``2001.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bigelow envisions building space hotels in about 15
years. He's the owner and president of Budget Suites of America and
Bigelow Aerospace, both in Las Vegas. His space company already has
hired teams to evaluate different hotel designs. As a first step,
Bigelow said the company would build an orbiting industrial park &LR; 
to serve companies working in space &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Richard Branson of Virgin Atlantic Airways in England has
announced his intention to design a Virgin Hotel that would be
reached via a new airline called Virgin Galactic Airways. &LR;  Branson
already has registered the airline.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Brian Hustig hopes that NASA will stay out of the
hotel-designing business. He's a senior designer with an
architectural firm that designs space resorts: Wimberly Allison
Tong &AMP; Co. of Newport Beach, Calif. ``People from NASA are coming
from a military background,'' he said. ``The last thing you want is
to have the U.S. government design the place where you spend your
vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hustig thinks that people will need more than zero-gravity to
keep them amused in space. He imagines space visitors playing
unique games while floating weightless (``Nerf soccer or
something'') and attending themed parties. ``The whole station
could be designed like `Star Wars,' and you could go up there and
become an alien for an evening,'' Hustig said.

 AN EXPERIENCE THAT'S OUT OF THIS WORLD  &HT;     By TERRY NAGEL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ What will it be like to travel in space?
</P>
<P>
   ``Weightlessness? It's awesome _ pure and total freedom! I wish
everyone could experience it. They'd become addicted,'' said former
astronaut Byron Lichtenberg, who flew Space Shuttle missions 9 and
45.
</P>
<P>
   During the filming of ``Apollo 13,'' when the cast and crew
experienced zero gravity, Director Ron Howard said, ``Saying
something is better than sex rarely lives up to that claim.
Weightlessness came awfully close.''
</P>
<P>
   With billing like that, it's no wonder that people are lining up
for space flights offered by two tour companies: Space Adventures
of Alexandria, Va., and Zegrahm Expeditions of Seattle. Both are
selling seven-day packages that include a suborbital flight lasting
about 21/2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Space Adventures is working with several rocket firms, so its
itinerary isn't firm. Zegrahm's passengers will board a two-stage
Space Cruiser that takes off from a conventional runway. After it
reaches an altitude of 50,000 feet, the stages will separate and
the first stage will return home.
</P>
<P>
   The second stage's rocket engines will throttle up and boost the
ship up more than 62 miles above Earth, beyond the edge of space.
By comparison, passenger jets cruise at an average altitude of
30,000 feet (5.7 miles) and the best military jets have trouble
climbing above 100,000 feet (about 19 miles).
</P>
<P>
   During the ascent, travelers will be able to see views in all
directions via cameras connected to a wrist control. The
weightlessness period, which will last only 21/2 minutes, will be
one of the highlights of the trip.
</P>
<P>
   The other aspect of space travel that astronauts recount with
awe is seeing Earth from space. Many have called it a
transformational experience. On this trip, participants won't see
the entire planet but will get to see Earth's curvature.
</P>
<P>
   Retro rockets will fire to slow the Space Cruiser for re-entry.
It will return to the airfield under jet power.

WHICH TEAM IS HACKETT COACHING?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC coach Paul Hackett was asked Sunday if he got
any sleep after returning home from South Bend, Ind., on Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. And my headache won't go away either,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   It could take a while before Hackett's head stops hurting after
the Trojans blew a 21-point lead against Notre Dame and lost 25-24
before a national television audience.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four hours later, Hackett was pondering some of the
things that happened in Notre Dame Stadium. And while there are
many questions, there are almost no answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what's happened. I don't know why,'' Hackett said. ``We
were two different teams. Why? I don't have a clue.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's just one of the plays that had Hackett perplexed: Notre
Dame quarterback Jarious Jackson's fumble that rolled into the end
zone was recovered by the Irish for the winning touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had seven guys on the ball. They had two guys. They got the
ball,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Consider two other plays with which Notre Dame beat USC that
Hackett didn't mention: The 49-yard reception to running back
Julius Jones in the first half, and the 7-yard touchdown pass to
tight end Dan O'Leary in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Both Irish receivers were wide open, even though those plays had
been repeatedly stressed in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew some of the plays that were coming and still let it
happen,'' cornerback Antuan Simmons said. ``That (touchdown), it's
their bread-and-butter play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet might sizzle this week with fiery comments about
the coaching, but the problem seems bigger than that.
</P>
<P>
   The first sign of a healthy program is winning on the road, and
the Trojans' road record is a sickly 3-7 since the start of last
season. The Trojans have demonstrated repeatedly they are not
mentally capable of being one of the conference's elite teams.
</P>
<P>
   Another sign of health is confidence, and USC loses it faster
than anyone in the second half. The Trojans are inept at protecting
leads this season. USC has blown two fourth-quarter leads (Oregon,
Notre Dame) and a third-quarter lead (Arizona).
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to perform in the clutch,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Added linebacker Markus Steele: ``The second half we just
couldn't put things together. That comes from heart. You have to go
out and do it. We're not playing a full 60 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the space of a few weeks, the Trojans have gone from thinking
they could play in the Rose Bowl to maybe not going to a bowl at
all. USC (3-3, 1-2) has to win four of its final six games to be
eligible for a bowl. You look at the schedule and circle the
victories.
</P>
<P>
   All along, October has stood out as the critical portion of the
schedule. So far, USC is 1-2, and here comes conference-leader
Stanford (4-0, 4-2) to the Coliseum on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are going to say the season's over,'' wide
receiver R. Jay Soward said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the team doesn't appear ready to throw in the towel, but
it's also confused about its direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``USC's one of the top schools in the nation and we're not even
ranked,'' linebacker Zeke Moreno said. ``I feel bad. We've got to
do something.''
</P>
<P>
   The only answer of course, is to win.
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: Center Eric Denmon (ankle) appeared OK on Sunday and
is listed as possible for the Stanford game, along with offensive
tackle Matt Welch (shoulder). Left guard Donta Kendrick re-sprained
his ankle and is considered doubtful. &QL;

QUARTERBACKS &QL; 
Mike Van Raaphorst was solid, as usual, but two turnovers and a
missed TD pass to a wide-open R. Jay Soward were costly. &QL;

ARTIST PROPOSES USING JELLYFISH GENES TO CREATE
GLOW-IN-THE-DARK  DOGS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Artist Eduardo Kac stunned several hundred
colleagues last month when he proposed using genetic engineering to
create a dog with fluorescent fur.
</P>
<P>
   ``The audience was dead silent,'' said Kac, a 37-year-old
Brazilian artist who now works in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, Kac wasn't addressing some crowd with, shall we say,
Rudolph Giuliani sensibilities. He broached his fluorescent canine
proposal at Ars Electronica, a 20-year-old international gathering
in Austria that brings artists together to explore the realm where
science intersects aesthetics.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even this sophisticated crowd seemed numb as Kac outlined
his plan _ so far theoretical _ to extract a harmless protein from
a jellyfish and insert it into the dog's genome so as to make its
fur glow with a green light.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Kac explained why he considered the
creation of a transgenic dog _ that is, a dog deliberately altered
with genes from another creature _ to be art.
</P>
<P>
   ``Society as a whole has not even become aware of the vocabulary
of this new wave of research and technique,'' he said. ``We cannot
leave this vocabulary in the hands of the few, the politicians, the
people from the business world, the scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The audience was barely able to frame a question,'' Kac
recalled. ``There was only one woman brave enough to say something.
She was clearly shaken.''
</P>
<P>
   That woman was San Francisco computer programmer Ellen Ullman,
author of ``Close to the Machine,'' a jaundiced look at modern
technophilia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, I was fascinated by his ideas, but I had this
growing sense of unease at the arrogance of his proposal,'' said
Ullman, just recently returned from the Ars Electronica. ``It is
one thing for an artist to experiment on a canvas, but it's
entirely different to experiment on a living creature.''
</P>
<P>
   She recalled questioning Kac about how this alteration would
affect the dog, and she was not mollified by his assurance that
fluorescence wasn't harmful. ``I wasn't just thinking of the harm
to the creature,'' she said. ``What does it do to a society to
casually create fluorescent dogs?''
</P>
<P>
   Beau Takahara, an artist with the Tech Museum in San Jose,
Calif., also heard Kac's lecture. It was Takahara who reported this
provocative exchange to the Coalition of Artists and Life Forms, a
group formed by San Francisco videographer Dale Hoyt to explore the
art potential of biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like Kac was really crossing some territory artists
hadn't crossed before, that no one had crossed before,'' Takahara
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Unbeknownst to the artists, however, scientists at Stanford
University have been creating mice and rats that glow since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Professor of pediatrics Christopher Contag, the Stanford
scientists discovered how to take the gene that causes fireflies to
emit a faint yellow glow and splice this gene into the tumor cells
of experimental animals.
</P>
<P>
   As the tumor grows, so does this yellow glow that a camera can
detect through the skin of the lab animal. Contag designed the
process to see how tumors responded to drug treatments without
having to kill the lab animals and study their remains. If a test
drug shrinks a glowing tumor, the result would be visible through
the rodent's skin.
</P>
<P>
   Science has a huge lead over art in the fluorescent-creature
race. About four years ago, Contag spun this idea off into Xenogen
Corp., a private startup based in Alameda, Calif. The company says
its technology could lead to faster and cheaper drug testing and
spare a lot of lab animals' lives.
</P>
<P>
   Xenogen, which is run by microbiologist Pamela Contag
(Christopher Contag's wife), earlier this year raised an impressive
$11 million in private financing from a variety of venture funds,
led by S.R. One Ltd., the venture capital arm of SmithKline Beecham
Pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   So art, in this case, imitates life.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes Kac's proposal, and the reaction to it, all the more
fascinating. If we can create fluorescent mice and rats in the name
of research, why not companion animals that emit a warm glow when
we stroke them in the dark?
</P>
<P>
   The broader question, of course, is how far should we take this
new power we're developing, to mold other creatures _ not to
mention ourselves _ to suit our plans or whims?
</P>
<P>
   That is the debate Kac sought to provoke when his proposal
(posted at &LR;   &LR; www.ekac.org) urged artists to ``increase global
biodiversity by inventing new life forms.'' Isn't that playing God,
I asked?
</P>
<P>
   ``As you can imagine, I've heard that question a lot,'' Kac
said, asking me what sort of God I envisaged, a Judeo-Christian
patriarch, an enigmatic Buddha, a host of animist deities?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't know how to play God,'' he replied, ``because I
wouldn't know what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, artist that he is, he's just been looking in the wrong
lab.

 Y2K CZAR SAYS THOUSANDS OF BUSINESSES STILL AT RISK  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ About 800,000 small businesses across the
country remain at risk for Year 2000 computer failures and there is
little the federal government can do to help if they experience
problems, said White House Y2K czar John Koskinen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a small company that decides to wait and fix it and
does not get it fixed on time, our position is, `That's life,'''
Koskinen said in a telephone interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great, free country, and you have the freedom to
fail,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen will be in San Francisco tomorrow to chair a free
public meeting to discuss how Bay Area government services and
businesses are preparing for January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen is chairman of the President's Council on Year 2000
Conversion, responsible for overseeing a $7.6 billion effort to fix
federal government computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K problem may cause software and microchips that are
programmed to only scan the last two digits in a year to
miscalculate the year 2000 as the year 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have accused Koskinen of downplaying the federal
government's Y2K problems to avoid spreading panic and fear.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen said he believes that federal agencies have made great
strides in the past year and will be ready to survive the date
change without serious problems.
</P>
<P>
   But he also said critics ignore the fact that his agency is
still warning that there will be Y2K failures abroad and that small
businesses and smaller hospitals in this country remain vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Small Business Administration last spring offered up to
$500 million in Y2K loans for small businesses. Koskinen noted that
to date, only 85 companies had Y2K loans approved or pending.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco ``Y2K Community Conversation,'' the latest in
about 350 town hall meetings nationwide sponsored by Koskinen's
council this year, is scheduled from 12:30 to 2:30 p.m. in the San
Francisco Main Public Library's Koret Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   The library is located in Civic Center at Larkin and Grove
streets.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting will feature Mayor Willie Brown and representatives
from Bay Area banks, utilities, police and fire departments.

<P>
   You know, attracting attention in the highly competitive dot-com
world isn't easy, and startup executives often must go to great
lengths to get noticed. But sometimes you just have to wonder, what
were they thinking?
</P>
<P>
   We offer, without further comment, a portion of a bio shipped to
us last week from Pamela Bergeson, CEO of Bid4Vacations.com, along
with a photo in which she is wearing a tiara and a beauty-queen
sash labeled ``Ms. Vacation Goddess.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS)
</P>
<P>
   In May of 1998, Ms. Bergeson got the idea for the company when
she bid for a computer at an online auction site. After winning,
she found herself jumping up and down. She thought others would get
excited about winning vacations by way of an online auction. The
company was officially launched in the heart of Colorado's
e-commerce corridor on April 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Stats: Nick Name: Dubbed the ``Vacation Goddess'` by the firm's
venture capitalists (photo attached).
</P>
<P>
   Career goal, Age five: To be a Stewardess and have ``Marsha
Brady'` hair.
</P>
<P>
   First job: At Disneyland, I was hostess of the ``Tiki Room.''
</P>
<P>
   Three words that best describe me: Risk taker, determined and
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   I'd give anything to meet: Cindy Crawford, poster child of
``Beauty &AMP; Brains.'`
</P>
<P>

   And this woman's company attracted venture funding. Budding
entrepreneurs, take heart.

ON BASEBALL: ATLANTA'S EXPLOSIVE OFFENSE COMES TO A STANDSTILL
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Atlanta Braves are trying to get to their fifth
World Series in the 1990s, but they sure are taking a strange
route.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, needing only one more victory to attain their
coveted goal, put 25 runners on base against the New York Mets in a
game at Shea Stadium Sunday that moved from afternoon to evening.
Only three of the runners scored, and the Braves lost Game 5 of the
National League Championship Series, 4-3, in a 15-inning,
5-hour-46-minute marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Weiss led off the 15th inning with a single, becoming the
23rd Braves base runner, and he scored the run that gave the Braves
a 3-2 lead. But the Braves left two other runners on in the inning,
giving them 19 for the game. The Mets had left nine on in the first
14 innings, then added three more in the 15th, when Robin Ventura
and two other runners did not round the bases and score after
Ventura hit what appeared to be a grand slam. He was credited with
a single and the Mets just one run, the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves were so feeble with runners on base that in one
five-inning span, the fourth through the eighth, they stranded 11
runners.
</P>
<P>
   Five of those runners failed to score in the sixth and seventh
innings, which epitomized the battle of strategic wits the
managers, Bobby Valentine of the Mets and Bobby Cox of the Braves,
had waged through the entire series.
</P>
<P>
   With the scored tied, 2-2, Ryan Klesko led off the sixth by
hitting a hard grounder directly at John Olerud at first base. But
Olerud couldn't contain the ball, and it rolled behind him. Edgardo
Alfonzo, who had darted over to back up, retrieved the ball quickly
and threw to Orel Hershiser, who had scooted over from the mound in
case he had a play at first. But the throw was high, and by the
time Hershiser reached high to catch the ball, he was past the
base.
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones then sacrificed Klesko to second, and Hershiser
walked Eddie Perez intentionally. Perez, at that point, had seven
hits in 15 times at bat in the series. But Hershiser then threw
four balls unintentionally to Walt Weiss, loading the bases. Greg
Maddux was the next batter. He was pitching too well and it was too
early for Bobby Cox to consider a pinch hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux, a good batter, hit some sharp fouls and had a 1-2 count
when he suddenly squared to bunt. Klesko broke from third and came
racing down the baseline. Cox had called for a most unconventional
suicide squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser's pitch was low and away and Maddux missed it. Klesko
instantly stopped heading home. Mike Piazza fired to third, his
throw slightly high, but Ventura reached up and caught it. Klesko
reversed direction again, and Ventura pursued him before throwing
home, where Hershiser made a quick tag.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, the Mets had gone from a one-out bases-loaded jam to
being out of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' half of the seventh inning began harmlessly with
Gerald Williams lofting a fly to right field for the first out. But
then Hershiser hit Bret Boone with a pitch. Cox sent the fleet Otis
Nixon in to run for Boone, and Valentine called for Turk Wendell to
replace Hershiser, triggering what would be a series of pitching
changes in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones, having an awful series after he destroyed the
Mets single-handedly in Atlanta last month, was the first batter
Wendell faced, and he struck out. But as he struck out, Nixon stole
second. Brian Jordan was the next batter for Wendell, and the first
two pitches to him were balls. That prompted Valentine to replace
Wendell with Dennis Cook. The Mets' manager chose that precise
moment to make the change because he was planning two moves ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Klesko, a left-handed hitter, would bat after Jordan, and if
Valentine brought in the left-handed Cook, Cox would have the
right-hand-hitting Brian Hunter bat for Klesko. Had Valentine
waited for Klesko to come to bat before he brought in Cook, the
left-handed reliever would have had to pitch to Hunter. But because
he came in to pitch to Jordan, Valentine would be able to counter
Cox's move with Hunter with a right-handed pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine wasn't taking a chance by having Cook pitch to the
right-handed Jordan because he was going to walk him intentionally,
throwing balls three and four purposely wide. Cook did that, Hunter
was announced as batting for Klesko and Valentine summoned Pat
Mahomes. Even though the walk was charged statistically to Wendell
because he threw the first two balls, Cook was credited with facing
one batter because Jordan completed his at-bat against Cook.
</P>
<P>
   Once a pitcher enters a game, he has to remain in the game until
he dispatches one batter.
</P>
<P>
   So now Valentine had the matchup he wanted, right-handed pitcher
against right-handed batter. So what did Mahomes do? He walked
Hunter on four pitches. That wasn't quite what Valentine had in
mind because the walk loaded the bases. But Andruw Jones, the next
Braves batter, also hits right-handed, and Cox wasn't about to use
a pinch-hitter for him because he is Atlanta's best defensive
outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, with only three hits in 15 at-bats in the series, worked
the count to 2-2 before hitting a fly ball to left field that
Rickey Henderson caught, ending the inning and the whirlwind of
changes.

SPORTS COLUMN: HENDERSON LOST FACE, BUT STILL PERFORMED
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The most important game in the New York Mets' season
stretched almost six hours into the rain-soaked night at Shea
Stadium Sunday night, finally ending in a scene of triumph for the
home team. But it began, in daylight, on a bizarre note of discord,
perhaps offering evidence of the sniping and backbiting that became
as a much a part of their armament this year as their gritty
``never say die'' play.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets arrived at Shea Stadium with a controversy hovering
overhead like the clouds that dropped bursts of rain on the
extra-inning marathon Sunday .
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the game, reporters stood in pockets on the field
surrounding players talking among themselves. The topic of
conversation was not Atlanta: Andruw Jones or Chipper Jones or the
despised reliever, John Rocker. The topic was Rickey: Rickey
Henderson, the Mets' veteran left fielder. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' dramatic victory of Saturday evening had quickly been
replaced by heated controversy revolving around Henderson's angry
reaction to being removed in the ninth inning of that game. The
Mets had taken the lead in the bottom of the eighth inning when
Melvin Mora and Roger Cedeno had executed a double steal and then
scored. With adrenaline flowing and spirits high, Henderson trotted
out to his post in left field.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months Valentine, pointing to a rash of injuries that
plagued his 40-year-old left fielder, had replaced Henderson for
defensive purposes with Mora. But this time there was no Mora.
Henderson, perhaps indulging an aging star's ego, assumed that
Valentine had finally come to his senses and was going to leave him
in at crunch time. Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine had simply forgotten to make the switch. Now he had
the choice of leaving Henderson in to avoid embarrassing him or
take him out in full view of sold-out Shea Stadium, risk
humiliating Henderson and deal with fallout later. Valentine chose
the latter. He dispatched Mora to left field to pull Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   Mora was mortified. ``I just told Rickey, `Rickey, he sent me
here.' Rickey said: `What? You've got to be kidding.' I said, `No,
he sent me here.' I don't make the decision, man. He says go to
left, I go to left field. I have to go to left field.''
</P>
<P>
   A seething Henderson slowly made his way off the field.
Valentine stood on the top step of the dugout and apologized, but
Henderson kept going. He went into the clubhouse and packed some
clothes. Afterward, he stayed out of media range.
</P>
<P>
   What could he say? Throughout the season there had been an
undercurrent of resentment, frustration and exasperation over what
essentially boils down to Henderson's style. Despite having an
exceptional season, there have been times when Henderson has not
run as hard as some thought he should. After Saturday's game, Turk
Wendell, the Mets reliever, disparaged Henderson with a thinly
veiled barb, saying there was only one quitter in the Mets'
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Quitter? Henderson? At 40, he is acknowledged as one of the
greatest leadoff hitters of all time. Who is Turk Wendell? Before
the game Wendell tried to apologize to Henderson. Henderson was not
interested.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson conceded that he was angry at the way he was taken out
of the game. ``How it was done, the reason it was done,'' Henderson
said. ``But he's the manager, I'm the player. We don't always
agree, but we have to stick together as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, in his first time at bat, Henderson beat out an infield
hit. He distracted Greg Maddux and forced him to throw more to
first than usual. Maddux finally grooved a home-run pitch to John
Olerud.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson also misjudged a fly ball in the fourth that allowed a
double to Bret Boone. Boone scored on a double by Chipper Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson left the game after striking out in the ninth inning.
The game went on and on, with startling turns and many big plays
until it finally concluded with a Robin Ventura smash in the bottom
of the 15th inning. By that time, the Henderson controversy was
over.
</P>
<P>
   For the Mets, this was a high-water mark. No playoff in 11
years, now finally a crucial victory over Atlanta, the National
League team of the decades, in extra innings. Their season was
still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy or no controversy, the Mets took a major step
forward Sunday night, and the game that revolved around Rickey
Henderson at the beginning was about something very much more at
the end.

METS-BRAVES GAME WAS LONG BUT HARDLY BORING 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ By the time the Mets' 15-inning, 4-3 victory over
Atlanta ended on Sunday night, the Yankees-Red Sox playoff game had
reached the seventh inning and ESPN's Washington-Arizona National
Football League game was in the second half. Oh, it was long, but
those many scoreless innings were rarely boring.
</P>
<P>
   Not when Braves Manager Bobby Cox and Mets Manager Bobby
Valentine had to empty their benches and contemplated activating
themselves. Not when, as NBC's Bob Costas noted, a post-season game
can come down to a journeyman like the Mets' Todd Pratt, 32, who
walked to tie the score at 3-3, against Kevin McGlinchy, the
Braves' 22-year-old rookie reliever.
</P>
<P>
   Costas' perfectly terse home run call _ ``a drive to right . . .
back to Georgia . . . gone . . . a grand slam'' _ was followed
smartly by describing the game as a ``a 5-hour-47-minute trip to
bedlam'' and the ruling that Robin Ventura's game-winning grand
slam had been reduced to a game-winning single because he never
reached second base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at the umpires, but they'd left the scene, but as we
were going off the air, we got it from Red Foley,'' Costas said
afterward, referring to the game's official scorer. ``For a long
time, the scoreboard said 3-3, then 7-3, and as I was leaving, it
said 4-3.''
</P>
<P>
   Costas and the NBC analyst Joe Morgan were quick to raise doubts
that Ventura's grand slam should count. But Ventura evidently
didn't care, knowing the single was what mattered. Prodded by Craig
Sager, an NBC reporter, to return to the field to complete the
four-base circuit previously blocked by his cheering, exuberant
teammates, Ventura said, ``I've had enough.''
</P>
<P>
   On Fox's telecast of the Yankees-Red Sox playoff game, the
producer Mike Weisman alertly replayed Chris Chambliss' American
League Championship Series-winning home run for the Yankees against
the Kansas City Royals in 1976 when an on-field mob scene prevented
him from touching all four bases.
</P>
<P>
   Chambliss, now the Yankees' hitting coach, was wired for sound
by Fox on Sunday night and provided commentary about the events at
Shea Stadium. ``Is that lousy, or what?'' he said, regarding the
ruling on Ventura's home run. Told by the team trainer Gene
Monahan, ``You've got to go around the bases, just like you had to
go around,'' Chambliss replied, ``I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura's dramatic grand slam-cum-single immediately evoked a
comparison with Kirk Gibson's pinch-hit two-run home run for the
Dodgers to win Game 1 of the 1988 World Series against Oakland.
Costas, who was part of NBC's coverage that day, said Ventura's hit
was not Gibson's peer. ``It was a World Series game,'' he said.
``And in truth, the Mets didn't need a home run to win the game. As
soon as the ball got into the outfield, they won. In the Gibson
game, they were down one run, with two outs, and there was his
physical condition.'' Gibson limped painfully to the plate that
day.
</P>
<P>
   But still, Costas said, ``This game ranks way up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Had a dreary victory by the Mets sent the series to Game 6,
Costas added: ``Somewhere in the back of your mind, you're saying,
`Ugh, another flight.' But now we can fly back to Atlanta on
adrenaline.'' &QL;

STRAWBERRY, PETTITTE SILENCE FANS AS YANKEES DOWN RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: The following story is an added starter on The New York
Times front page) (rk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The New York Yankees were here on the day before the
July 31 trade deadline, when Joe Torre told George Steinbrenner on
a conference call that he wanted to keep Andy Pettitte, rather than
trade him to Philadelphia. Torre cited Pettitte's penchant for
winning big games.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner went along with the recommendation of Torre and
general manager Brian Cashman, making it clear they would be held
responsible if Pettitte floundered. But Sunday night, Torre and
Cashman have the right to smugly offer I-told-you-so's, after
Pettitte and the Yankees beat the Boston Red Sox, 9-2, in Game 4 of
the American League Championship Series. The Yankees, who blew open
a tense game with six runs in the ninth, lead by 3-1 in the
best-of-7 series.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees do not want this series to reach a seventh game;
they do not want Pedro Martinez _ against whom they have five hits
and 35 strikeouts in their last 61 at-bats _ to get another chance
to pitch, in what would be the deciding game.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees now have two opportunities to clinch this series
before a seventh game: Orlando Hernandez, their best pitcher, will
face Boston's Kent Mercker Monday in Game 5, and if the Red Sox win
and extend the series, then David Cone would throw against Ramon
Martinez in Game 6 on Wednesday at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees led, 3-2, in the eighth, and blew a great scoring
chance in the top half of the inning: They had second and third and
nobody out and could not push across a run. But Boston couldn't
score in the bottom of the eighth, and in the top of the ninth, the
Red Sox made two of their four errors and Ricky Ledee bashed a
pinch-hit grand slam off Rod Beck, and the Yankees could breathe
easy. Pettitte surrendered two runs on eight hits in 7 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the ninth, the game was delayed for about five
minutes because of disruptive fans. When the teams returned to the
field, the Yankees closed out the game. The fans were upset about
two contested calls in consecutive innings that had gone against
the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, sternly moved around
his team's clubhouse after Game 3s blow-out loss, and then again
before Sunday night's game, a living reminder of consequences. A
phone rang in the press room while Torre spoke with the media after
Game 3, and Torre asked if the phone was for him, adding, ``You
never know'' _ and everybody laughed, knowing what he meant.
Steinbrenner is omnipresent, especially in defeat.
</P>
<P>
   But Torre felt his team was relaxed, confident and fully aware
of the importance of Game 4. Torre shook up his lineup a bit,
replacing left fielder Ricky Ledee with Chad Curtis, and inserting
Darryl Strawberry as his designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   When Strawberry came to bat for the first time, the Fenway Park
fans offered a new and different chorus for the slugger with the
history of drugs and alcohol abuse _ ``Just Say No,'' they cried.
``Just Say No,'' the mournful chant, louder and louder. Boston's
Bret Saberhagen threw a high fastball and Strawberry rattled a high
drive two-thirds of the way up the right field foul pole, a solo
home run. It was the last time the hearty singers serenaded
Strawberry on this evening.
</P>
<P>
   The sensitive Pettitte, too, was hearing it _ Andy, Andy, they
called _ and the Red Sox tied the game in the bottom of the second.
Butch Huskey slamming a double into the left-field corner, but
appeared to pull a leg muscle as he came out of the box. When Troy
O'Leary singled to Bernie Williams in center field, however,
Huskey's slogging limp did not deter Wendell Kim, the Boston third
base coach, from waving Huskey around third in a direct challenge
of Williams' weak throwing arm. Huskey scored easily.
</P>
<P>
   That success may have led to a poor decision by Kim in the next
inning, when the Red Sox assumed a 2-1 lead but lost an opportunity
for more. Damon Buford singled, stole second and scored when Jose
Offerman rolled a base hit through the middle.
</P>
<P>
   John Valentin smacked a long drive to left, where Curtis _ who
started, in part, because of his defensive familiarity with
Fenway's 37-foot high left-field wall _ misjudged the flight of
Valentin's shot. He was too close to the wall when the ball hit,
and it ricocheted off Curtis and behind him. Williams moved to back
up the play, and Boston's third base coach waved frantically,
beckoning Offerman around third base, sending him home.
</P>
<P>
   It was a serious miscalculation. Williams made a quick and short
throw to the shortstop Derek Jeter, and with his powerful arm,
Jeter relayed a rocket to catcher Joe Girardi; the ball arrived at
the plate in plenty of time for Girardi to reach and slap a tag on
Offerman _ the second out of the inning, with Nomar Garciaparra,
Boston's best hitter, due to bat.
</P>
<P>
   Boston made more mistakes in the top of the fourth, and it cost
the Red Sox their lead. One out into the bottom of the fourth,
Bernie Williams rolled a grounder to the right of Garciaparra, and
the Boston shortstop hurried, gloved the ball, fired sidearm _ and
high, the ball sailing well over the outstretched mitt of the first
baseman Mike Stanley and into the Red Sox dugout. Williams was
allowed to take second on the fourth error of the series by
Garciaparra, who is one short of the AL championship series record.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen fell behind in the count by three balls and no
strikes to Tino Martinez, fought back to 3-2, then threw a pitch
right over the heart of the plate; Martinez whacked it, the ball
short-hopping off the base of the low wall in right-center field.
Williams trotted home with the tying run, Martinez pulled into
second base with a double.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen intentionally walked Strawberry _ just say no, as far
as Saberhagen was concerned _ then struck out Scott Brosius and
appeared to be out of the inning when Chad Curtis hit a sharp
grounder toward Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston first baseman backed up to glove the ball, and
Saberhagen quickly moved to cover first base, Curtis running hard
down the line but well behind Saberhagen. Stanley's throw, however,
reached Saberhagen about thigh high, so that the pitcher had to
draw up his hands awkwardly to attempt the catch. The ball fell out
of his mitt and rolled away, and Jose Cardenal, the Yankees' first
base coach, whirled and waved his right arm frantically, signaling
to Martinez to keep running, keep going home, and Martinez crossed
the plate standing. Yankees 3, Boston 2, and Steinbrenner, sitting
adjacent to his team's dugout, was laughing openly and appeared to
be jockeying playfully with Red Sox fans sitting nearby.
