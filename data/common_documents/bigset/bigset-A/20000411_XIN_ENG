<HEADLINE> Asia's Largest Exhibition Venue Opens in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore Expo, the largest
exhibition venue in Asia, was officially opened Monday as part of
the achievements the Singapore government has made in promoting
the exhibition industry and turning the city state into an
exhibition hub in the world as well as in the region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the joint opening of the Singapore Expo and Food &AMP;
Hotel Asia 2000 in the evening, acting Singapore Prime Minister
Lee Hsien Loong said, "The international exhibition industry looks
set for further growth in the years to come. With the Singapore
Expo, we now have the infrastructure and supporting systems in
place to ride the wave."
</P>
<P>
The Singapore Expo, built at a cost of 220 million Singapore
dollars (about 130 million U.S. dollars), offers 60,000 square
meters of column-free indoor exhibition space, 20,000 square
meters of outdoor exhibition space, 10 well-equipped conference
rooms of various sizes and nine meeting rooms.
</P>
<P>
The indoor space is divided into six inter-connected halls,
each with its own meeting room and food and beverage outlets and
its ground-level exhibition halls facilitate easy movement of move-
in and move-out operation, saving a lot money and time. In
addition, it is fully equipped with state-of-the-art exhibition
and conference facilities.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore Expo is also equipped with 2,200 dedicated
parking lots for visitors/exhibitors who drive and two taxi stands
for the convenience of other visitors.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition venue, owned by the Ministry of Trade and
Industry and managed by the Port of Singapore Authority
Corporation Ltd., started operation in March 1999 and hosted more
than 55 major international exhibitions last year.
</P>
<P>
In an average month, it hosts five events with a total
attendance of 30,000 visitors. However, it attracted a record
number of events and visitors in March 2000 hosting 15 events
attended by some 100,000 visitors.
</P>
<P>
Lee revealed in his speech that some 90 trade and consumer
exhibitions, out of which 75 are international, will be held at
the center this year.
</P>
<P>
By the mid-1990s, Singapore was hosting more than 100
exhibitions every year, which attracted more than 200,000 overseas
exhibitors.
</P>
<P>
Lee also said his government will continue to promote the
exhibition industry as it is a significant source of tourism
revenues for Singapore.
</P>
<P>
"The Meeting, Incentives, Conventions and Exhibitions or 'MICE'
sector brings in up to 400,000 overseas visitors annually," Lee
said, adding that they spend on average three times as much as
other visitors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the food &AMP; Hotel Asia 2000, which will open to the
public Tuesday and occupies all the six halls at the Singapore
Expo, brings together some 2,500 participants from 67 countries
and areas and its showcasing of the latest products in the food
and hospitality sector is expected to attract 16,000 overseas and
28,000 local visitors.

<HEADLINE> SAARC Progress Slow Since Inception: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Experts in Bangladesh Monday noted
that the process of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation(SAARC) to achieve its coveted objectives has
progressed slowly since its inception in 1985 due to many problems.
</P>
<P>
At a roundtable here, they identified bureaucracy, the arms
race,the nuclear threat, the Kashmir issue, trade barriers, trade
imbalance,bilateral disputes, lack of initiatives at the regional
level, the weak institutional shape of the SAARC Secretariat and
lack of contact with other regional bodies as major impediments
that have slowed the process of SAARC's desired progress.
</P>
<P>
A good number of academicians and development thinkers were
present at the roundtable on "SAARC Process and Regional
Cooperation in South Asia" organized by Bangladesh Institute of
International and Strategic Studies (BIISS). BIISS Director
General Ahsan was in the chair.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Ahsan said that over the last 15 years, SAARC
has developed some institutional capacity but it still needs an
effective platform for sustainable cooperation among the member
countries.
</P>
<P>
Former Foreign Secretary Farooq Sobhan said SAARC could not
progress due to a number of problems.
</P>
<P>
"If we could remove the trade barriers, SAARC would progress
substantially in both trade and investment fields since the region
itself has been trying to have common trade and investment regimes,
"he said.
</P>
<P>
He also referred to the recent visit of U.S. President Bill
Clinton to South Asia and said it had, in fact, opened a door
toward encouraging the need for better and more prospective
regional cooperation among the seven countries within the SAARC
framework.
</P>
<P>
Zaidi Sattar of the World Bank said that despite trade and non-
trade barriers created by the governments in this region, natural
tendencies are taking place toward enhanced trade and business
among the nations.
</P>
<P>
"Bilateral trade balance is not an issue but regional trade
balance is important for a solid cooperation among the nations
here,"he observed.
</P>
<P>
In his summing-up address, Sobhan said SAARC is now at the
crossroads facing problems and he urged the governments of the
member countries to increasingly try to improve the regional
cooperation process.
</P>
<P>
SAARC groups Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal,
Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

<HEADLINE> China to Put More Into Technological Upgrading (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- China is to increase funding for
technological upgrading of key enterprises in major sectors by
allowing interest discounts on loans and providing subsidies,
sources with the State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC)
disclosed here today.
</P>
<P>
Gan Zhihe, director of SETC's Investment sector, said that
China earmarked nine billion yuan of the total 100-billion-yuan
treasury bond for technological upgrading this year to encourage
enterprise renovation and industry upgrading.
</P>
<P>
Gan said the fund will be used in two ways: one is in the form
of subsidies, which will be given to 520 key state enterprises,
120 major enterprise groups and companies with good social and
economic returns; the other is interest discounts for enterprises
with state-recognized key projects.
</P>
<P>
"As usual, key industries, key enterprises and key products
will be given priority when considering the sum of funding, but
this year, a few companies in difficulties but with potential and
good projects will also be considered and enterprises in western
areas will enjoy some preferential policies," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gan said the funding will be used mainly to help enterprises
improve development capabilities, establish research and
development centers and build energy conservation projects.
</P>
<P>
The money going to new technological projects, which took the
lion's share last year, will account for a smaller proportion this
year, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Industrial and Commercial
Bank of China will take advantage of the popularity of the
Internet and mobile phones to expand its business.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the bank plans to move its branches to large and
medium-sized cities and those areas with more potential depositors.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that the ICBC is now the largest
commercial bank in China. By the end of 1999, the bank had
deposits of 1,649.2 billion yuan, up 20 percent annually over the
past five years. Its foreign currency deposit reached 10.2 billion
US dollars, up 25 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, ICBC has spared no efforts to extend its
business range and focus its operations on retail businesses.
</P>
<P>
Along with traditional deposit business, the bank provides some
new services. By the end of 1999, the bank had installed 8,300
ATMs and 56,800 POSs across the country.

<P>
A considerable sum will be given to support the completion of
647 technological projects launched last year, with the main
purpose of triggering economic growth, Gan said.
</P>
<P>
The SETC is working on new management measures to handle the
huge amount of funding. "With the transformation of government
functions, repetitive and redundant authorization processes should
be omitted, and the management methods of fixed assets and
technological funds will be improved," Gan pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The commission has stressed that banks should be given more
freedom in giving loans independently. "They can determine funding
by assessing the enterprise's credibility and the project's risk,"
Gan noted.
</P>
<P>
China started a massive state-owned enterprise technological
upgrading program in a move to expand domestic demand and help the
enterprises as a whole out of difficulties in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
China issued an additional 60 billion yuan in state bonds in
the latter half of 1999, nine billion of which was also earmarked
for technological upgrading of state-owned enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Amends Laws to Secure Trouble-Free Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's parliament has approved
amendments to laws regulating legislative elections which will take
place later this year with the aim of securing a trouble-free vote,
the country's Middle East News Agency reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The amendments, approved Monday night by the People's Assembly,
will provide for police to be posted outside each polling station
to prevent intimidation of voters and forestall the kind of
violence that shook previous elections in 1995 when around 60
people died.
</P>
<P>
At that time, Egypt's opposition spoke out against "electoral
fraud," which they claimed had allowed the National Democratic
Party led by President Hosni Mubarak to win 417 of the 454 seats in
the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Judicial observers will also be charged with overseeing the
entire electoral process and guarantee fair vote counting in the
elections in 2000, according to the amendments.
</P>
<P>
But members of the opposition Al-Wafd Party rejected the
measures as "insufficient and deceptive." The party had called for
the annulment of laws dating to the era of President Gamal Abdel
Nasser in the 1960s, under which at least 50 percent of the
parliament members must be workers or farmers.
</P>
<P>
But Minister of State for the People's Assembly and the Shura
(Consultative) Council Affairs Kamal Mohamed el-Shazli told the
parliament that the legislation would remain in place.
</P>
<P>
The elections are due to take place in November, but no precise
date has been set.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Proposes Summit in March Every Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League has proposed that
the Arab countries convene a summit in March every year, a senior
league official said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mustafa al-Fiqqi, Arab League assistant secretary general for
Arab affairs told reporters that the proposal to make a regular
March summit the pan-Arab forum's highest authority would be
discussed on May 24 by the foreign ministers of Egypt, Oman, Syria,
Tunisia and Yemen.
</P>
<P>
The five countries form a committee to deal with the issue
concerning the convocation of Arab summits on a regular basis. The
League's 1945 charter does not stipulate the holding of Arab
summits and states that the council of foreign ministers is its
highest body.
</P>
<P>
Al-Fiqqi said the March date has been chosen as the best time
for holding a summit as leaders and foreign ministers are usually
busy later in the year with the United Nations General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Yemen had earlier proposed holding a regular summit in November
every year. The league's proposal is a combination of ideas put
forward by Yemen and the Cairo-based forum's secretariat.
</P>
<P>
Despite frequent talks about the subject, differences among Arab
states have made no more summit possible since 1996 in Cairo, and
even then Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was not invited because of
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Warns Israel Against More Attacks in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid warned Tuesday against an escalation of Israeli
military campaign in south Lebanon, saying that the Jewish state's
policies would lead to the "destruction of peace."
</P>
<P>
Israeli aircraft carried out four raids Tuesday on the area
occupied by Israel in south Lebanon in retaliation for the
Hezbollah guerrillas' rocket attacks on Israeli army positions.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid warned of the "dangers of the continuation of
Israeli policy," which he said was "leading towards the destruction
of peace," in remarks to reporters after meeting Russian Ambassador
to Egypt Vladimir Gudev.
</P>
<P>
He also accused Israel of obstructing peace negotiations with
the Palestinians and Syrians as well as the Lebanese and said
Jewish settlement building in the West Bank has increased under the
government of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League chief called on Russia to use its weight as co-
sponsor of the peace process to convince Israel to reverse its
hostile policies.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's FM Pledges to Improve G-77's Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Foreign Minister Alhaji
Sule Lamido pledged Tuesday that the Group of 77 countries would
improve its work mechanisms with the aim to make the South Summit'
s agreements be as effective as possible.
</P>
<P>
The speaker obtained financial support from all the
participants to back up the work of the group's president in New
York regarding the implementation of the summit's final
declaration and the follow-up to the action programs originated at
this meeting.
</P>
<P>
Sule Lamido, whose country is actually heading the G-77, read
the opening speech at the foreign ministers' meeting, preceding
the South Summit which is to begin its work Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During his speech before the delegations gathered at the
Convention Palace in Havana, he expressed confidence that the
final documents would improve the unity and contribute to
communication aiming at the international community's development.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the internal performance of the G-77, he said that up
to now there have been many futile attempts directed at creating
an effective mechanism to drive the fulfillment of the adopted
accords from former summits.
</P>
<P>
In this sense he reminded that nowadays there is only a reduced
personnel at New York city's office, which mainly depends on the
funding provided by the country selected to head in a given year
the Group of 77.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian foreign minister proposed that prior to the end of
the South Summit, on Friday, the 133 countries that make up the
organization make a commitment to improve the funding to finance
the work of the New York headquarters.

<HEADLINE> G-77 Foreign Ministers Begin Debate on U.N. Role in New Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers from the Group
of 77 (G-77) member states Tuesday began an interactive debate on
the role of the United Nations in the 21st century, hoping to
boost the U.N. role in aiding the developing South and prepare for
the Millennium Summit, scheduled for September in New York.
</P>
<P>
The debate will be held behind closed doors until 18:00
Tuesday, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the topic at the opening session of foreign
ministers Tuesday morning, Cuban Foreign Minister Felipe Perez
Roque said, "I hope that our extensive and democratic discussion
will be a clear indication of our aspirations, and at the same
time will contribute to the preparatory work for the Millennium
Summit."
</P>
<P>
The developing South, whose representatives are gathering in
Havana for the largest participation of heads of state and
government in the 36-year history of G-77, has been long calling
for a just and new international political and economic system,
and a bigger U.N. role in working for economic equality between
the South and the North.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, leaders of developing countries were drawing up a
call for a new world order meant to help them eradicate poverty
while foreign ministers were proposing calls on rich nations to
forgive debts, increase aid and trade, share new technology and
shift more decision-making power to the United Nations away from
institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund.
</P>
<P>
"We want to achieve a more democratic and equitable
arrangement," said a draft of the proposed plan of action for the
133-nation body, which is holding its first summit since its
founding in June 1964.
</P>
<P>
About 40 heads of state or government are expected to take
part in the top-level talks scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday.

<HEADLINE> G-77 Ministerial Meeting Starts in Havana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Group of 77's South Summit
started Tuesday in Havana with the meeting of the foreign
ministers of the participating countries.
</P>
<P>
Cuban Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque said that the South-
South cooperation is of utmost importance, but that the support
from the North is necessary.
</P>
<P>
The ministers analyzed the report they received Monday from the
experts, who discussed the documents that are to be approved by
the moment the Summit is over, Friday.
</P>
<P>
Issues regarding globalization were present during a much of
the deliberations, as well as the possibility of access from the
South to technical knowledge and technology, which the developed
world enjoys almost exclusively at the present.
</P>
<P>
Arthur Mbanefo, president of the Group of 77, pledged Monday an
"interactive" dialogue for an international system more suitable
for the majority of nations, which are the poorest of the world as
well.
</P>
<P>
The United Nation's design for the twenty first century is also
one of the main issues dealt with Tuesday in this capital city by
the foreign ministers of the 133 participating countries within
the G-77.
</P>
<P>
The meeting started Sunday and there will be over 50 leaders
participating. They keep on arriving in this capital along with
ministers and experts.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Calls for North-South Fair Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) pledged Tuesday respectful, fair and mutually
advantageous relations between developed and developing countries.
</P>
<P>
UNDP Public Relations and Communication Director Djibril Diallo
said that two actions can be carried out to change the current
state of the world order.
</P>
<P>
First, rich countries must increase their development
assistance to the less developed countries; second, a solution to
the foreign debt problem.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat regretted that five years after the Copenhagen
1995 Social Development Summit, there are many poor nations still
being affected by severe poverty conditions.
</P>
<P>
He considered the agenda being discussed by the developing
countries as very important during the first G-77 South Summit,
scheduled to take place on April 12-14.
</P>
<P>
Among the issues being covered prior to the beginning of the
Havana Summit are South-South cooperation, unequal North-South
relations, and technological difference between rich and
underdeveloped countries.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP is present in 174 countries and territories, and has
as its main task to advise the governments of the developing
countries, especially in poverty eradication, job creation, and
environment protection.

<HEADLINE> Barak to Hold Talks With Clinton on Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak is starting talks first with high-ranking U.S. officials and
then with President Bill Clinton in the evening in a hope to
salvage the stalled peace process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who flew in Washington at 3:15 a.m., hurried here to a
summons from President Clinton at a time as the Israel-Palestinian
talks at Bolling Air Force Base near Washington have been balking
with no progress in sight and the Syrian-Israeli talks see no
promise for resumption. And he is now trying to launch another
peace offensive on the Lebanon track by unilateral withdrawal from
southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure for Washington, Barak's aides said the
prime minister's priority in the Tuesday evening meeting with
Clinton would be to secure U.S. support for Israel's impending
pull out of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The low-level expectation shows that Barak no longer believes
he can meet the ambitious goal of a comprehensive Middle East
peace by year's end.
</P>
<P>
Barak is now meeting with U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross. He
will then meet with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
National Security Adviser Sandy Berger before seeing Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Israel's embassy spokesman Mark Regev said Barak was "very
serious about the series of meetings he has today."
</P>
<P>
With regard to Clinton, he was anxious to secure a Middle East
peace breakthrough before leaving office in nine months.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters that the
president thought it was important to use the meeting with Barak
and the meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat next week as
a chance to "take stock of where they are and keep the process
moving forward."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators, meeting at the
Bolling Air Force Base, kept working on an overall settlement as
well as another Israeli pullback on the West Bank scheduled for
June.
</P>
<P>
"So far there are no results," Hasan Abdel Rahman, the PLO
representative in Washington, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Rahman said the Palestinians wanted Clinton to make clear to
Barak that the negotiations must be concluded successfully by
September 13, a deadline set by the United States, Israel and the
Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Environment Minister Tables Endangered Species Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Environment Minister
David Anderson tabled an endangered species bill Tuesday in a bid
to intensify protection of animals such as the grizzly bear and
piping plover.
</P>
<P>
The bill suggests fines of up to 1 million Canadian dollars (
about 690,000 U.S. dollars) for corporations and 250,000 dollars (
about 172,500 U.S. dollars) for individuals for killing any of
endangered wildlife.
</P>
<P>
A jail term of five years is also possible for those convicted
of killing endangered species or destroying their habitat under
the new Species at Risk Act introduced in the Commons.
</P>
<P>
The proposed legislation, among others, makes provision for
compensating landowners in case an endangered species happens to
live on their property and causes severe financial losses.
</P>
<P>
Minister Anderson already announced a program in December to
provide private landowners with incentive to preserve endangered
species.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government was reported to set aside 90 million
Canadian dollars (about 62.1 million U.S. dollars) over three
years in the budget for that purpose.

<HEADLINE> Russia Favors Just Solution to Cyprus Issue: Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Russia firmly supports a lasting
and just solution to the Cyprus issue, said Russian Ambassador to
Cyprus Vladimir Pavlinov here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting with the ruling Democratic Rally party
leader Nicos Anastasiades, Pavlinov said Russia's position on
Cyprus has not changed after Vladimir Putin was elected president
of the Russian Federation last month.
</P>
<P>
"Actually I said whoever is president, head of the government in
Russia, our position on the Cyprus issue is the same," Pavlinov was
quoted as saying by Cyprus News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said the formula for a lasting and just solution of the
Cyprus issue can be worked out during the talks between the leaders
of the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities in the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974, when Turkish troops invaded and occupied 37
percent of Cyprus' northern area after a failed pro-Athens coup in

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Backs Mideast Peace Process: DM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIYADH, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia always backs the
efforts aimed at establishing a just and comprehensive peace in the
Mideast region, said Saudi Defense Minister Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz
on Tuesday. "We are against any change of this concept," said
the minister at a joint press conference held in the Red Sea port
city of Jeddah with visiting British Secretary of State for Defence
Geoff Hoon.
</P>
<P>
"However, peace cannot be established unless Israel withdraws
fully from the Lebanese and Syrian territories and recognizes the
rights of Lebanese and Syrian peoples as well as the right of
Palestinian refugees to return to their homeland under the U.N.
Security Council resolutions," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Hoon said that Britain and the United States were
committed to maintaining security and peace in the Persian Gulf. He
appreciated contributions by Saudi Arabia in this respect.
</P>
<P>
"Through our cooperation, we can establish a common modern
security and protection system in this region," he underscored.
</P>
<P>
Britain and Saudi Arabia are trying to strengthen their military
and security ties and economic and investment cooperation as well,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The British military chief called on the international community
to exert all necessary efforts to back the Mideast peace process
and expressed his country's readiness to offer any help or
guarantee to this end.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the reported purchase of U.S. warplanes and
development of Saudi infantry troops, Prince Sultan said "We are
developing our troops continuously and we will not stop at any
limit."
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with visiting U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen in Jeddah on Sunday, Sultan discussed a 504-million-U.S.-
dollar deal for the purchase of more than 12 F-15 fighters to
replace older ones.
</P>
<P>
On the reported Saudi mediation between Algeria and Morocco, he
said "I do not think there is a hostility between the two Arab
neighbors that deserves a mediation."
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, King Mohammed VI of Morocco and Algerian
President Abdelaziz Bouteflika are going on the right path towards
rapprochement, he noted, adding "we are just supporters."
</P>
<P>
Morocco and Algeria, two members of the Arab Maghreb Union, have
been quarrelling for years over the Western Sahara.
</P>
<P>
Hoon, who arrived in Saudi Arabia for a two-day visit Monday,
has met separately with Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz, and Crown
Prince and First Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz.
</P>
<P>
He will continue his tour to Oman later Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Army Warns of Attacks on North after Pullback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Senior Israel Defense Forces
(IDF) officers Tuesday issued warnings that Israel's northern
border areas would not be quiet after Israeli troops withdraw from
south Lebanon by July, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Knesset (Parliament) Foreign Affairs and Defense
Committee, IDF Chief of General Staff Shaul Mofaz said there might
be potential major flare-up of "terrorist attacks" against Israeli
northern settlements after a unilateral pullout from the so-called
security zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
To show Israel's determination to revenge in such a case, Mofaz
said that if an uneasy reality emerged along the international
border between Israel and Lebanon, IDF will adopt a clear-cut
policy of deterrence and retaliation.
</P>
<P>
He added that Israel will not tolerate any situation that it
redeploys on the basis of U.N. Security Council resolutions but
remains under threats of attacks.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a senior IDF intelligence office also warned that
Palestinian rejectionist groups in Lebanon, which have been in
dormant in recent years, would be reactivated because of the
security vacuum left by the planned pullout.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he told the Knesset committee, there were signs that
Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas, a Shiite Muslim militia fighting to
end Israeli occupation since 1980s, are recruiting "terrorists"
from the 300,000 Palestinian refugees in Lebanese camps.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas, who had killed at least seven IDF soldiers and
wounded dozens since the beginning of this year, want to justify
its attacks against Israel with the Palestinian refugees, as the
office put it.
</P>
<P>
Many of the refugees have been kept in exile for decades because
the wars between Israel and the Arabs since 1948 and desperately
want to go back their homes, a right rejected by Israel till now.
</P>
<P>
The prospect of a Palestinian uprising in south Lebanon reminds
many Israelis of the situation along the border in 1970s and early
80s, which prompted Israel to set up the security zone in 1985 with
a self-claimed aim of preventing cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
But mounting death toll during the 22-year occupation prompted
Israeli cabinet to decide on March 5 to endorse a key pledge by
Prime Minister Ehud Barak to withdraw from the zone by July, with
or without a peace deal with Syria, the major power broker in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
This move was believed aimed at pressuring Syria to return to
the negotiating table, as it would deprive Syria of the major
bargaining chip in their demanded return of the Golan Heights, a
strategic Syrian plateau seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle East
war.
</P>
<P>
However, Syrian President Hafez al-Assad did not soften his
stance under pressure, as indicated by his summit with U.S.
President Bill Clinton in Geneva on March 26, which failed to
unblock the stalemate in peace talks.
</P>
<P>
A unilateral withdrawal which the Barak administration seems
determined to pursue in the absence of a security agreement with
Syria and Lebanon, warned some IDF generals, would be dangerous and
bloody.
</P>
<P>
They said they have seen bad omens from a letter sent to U.N
Secretary General Kofi Annan by Lebanese President Emil Lahoud last
week.
</P>
<P>
The letter warned that extremist Palestinian factions in Lebanon
refugee camps are expected to operate against Israel after the
withdrawal.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Majlis Gives Municipality Limited Command over Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran's outgoing conservative Majlis
(parliament) on Tuesday rejected a government bill to bring
Tehran's traffic police under the municipality's command, but gave
the city limited administrative rights over the police.
</P>
<P>
By amending the law concerning the security forces, or the
police, the Majlis instructed the traffic police to act under the
directives of the municipality, now under control of pro-
reformists, with the exception of emergency cases.
</P>
<P>
The municipality will provide the traffic police with all
equipment, installations, facilities and financial obligations
except wages and bonus of personnel, telecommunication equipment,
arms and ammunition, the official Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
A by-law on implementation, including the appointment of senior
police officials, will be formulated in six months by the Interior
Ministry in cooperation with the police headquarters and upon
cabinet approval, the agency added.
</P>
<P>
The traffic police have been blamed for its inefficiency in
regulating traffic, a major source of all pollution in the capital
city, and in curbing the rise in road accidents.
</P>
<P>
The government fielded the bill late last year, requesting the
Majlis to allow the municipality to command the traffic police in
order to improve the chaotic traffic situation and reduce air
pollution caused by outworn vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Mayor Moteza Alviri said last year that 72 percent of the
pollution in the city is caused by the traffic. He boasted that
pollution will be sharply decreased if the Majlis puts the traffic
police under his control.
</P>
<P>
The traffic police, like the army and the Islamic Revolutionary
Guards Corps, are under the direct command of the supreme leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is also commander-in-chief of Iran's
armed forces.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Business Leaders Envision New President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Turkish business leaders on Tuesday
expressed their expectation for a new president who is experienced
in foreign policy and economy.
</P>
<P>
As incumbent President Suleyman Demirel's tenure expires on May
15, the race for the 10th president of Turkey has started. The
candidates should apply to the Parliament Speaker's Office on April
16-25.
</P>
<P>
The coalition government, led by Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit,
suffered a setback last week when parliament rebuffed his efforts
to amend the constitution in order to secure another term for
Demirel, 76.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Turkish business circle said they expected a
president tactful on foreign policy, who can preserve stability in
Turkish internal and external affairs.
</P>
<P>
They said,"Turkey turned its direction to the West. It is a
leader in Turkish-spoken countries as well, so it must maintain
this mission."
</P>
<P>
Fuat Miras, chairman of Turkish Union of Chambers and Trade,
said ,"Turkey has played a role in many international organizations
and global arena. The new president should be able to maintain
Turkey's position in the world and keep existing relations with
other countries."
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the new president will show Turkey's modern
western face to the world in the process from a European Union (EU)
candidate to a full member.
</P>
<P>
Refik Baydur, chairman of Turkish Confederation of Employers'
Unions, said that they expected a respectable president, who can
make himself accepted by the outside world as well.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the new president can succeed in maintaining Turkey's
positive relations with European countries.
</P>
<P>
Other leading business figures said that Turkey must speed up
its economic development on a basis of political stability.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's president is elected by parliament for a seven-year
term. The post is largely symbolic, but the president can serve as
a
behind-the-scene power broker, especially in times of crisis.

TEHRAN, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hamid Reza Asefi on Tuesday expressed welcome to a planned summit
meeting between leaders of the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK) and the Republic of Korea (ROK).
</P>
<P>
Iran hopes the talks would produce tangible and constructive
results in line with the interests of the two peoples in the Korean
peninsula, Asefi was quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed hope that the two countries would be able to
solve their outstanding problems and restore peace, security and
unity in the peninsula through talks and understanding.
</P>
<P>
The summit, to be held on June 12-14 in Pyongyang, was announced
jointly by Pyongyang and Seoul on Monday. It will be the first
encounter between the leaders of the two sides since the end of the
Korean War in 1945.
</P>
<P>
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung said Tuesday that the summit
would be a "big step forward" in the peace efforts in the peninsula
though it would be unlikely to resolve any of the major issues
dividing the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"The national issues, which have been divisive for a half
century, cannot be resolved overnight," he said, adding that
economic assistance and cooperation, reunions of millions of
separated family members and tension-easing measures will top the
agenda of the summit.

<HEADLINE> Feature: The Smile Train Runs Faster in China  (by Xie Meihua) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW ORLEANS, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Smile Train in 1999
funded 2,000 cleft surgeries for Chinese children and will fund 4,
000 surgeries in 2000, J. Bexter Urist, president of The Smile
Train, told the press Monday in Computer Associates International
Inc (CA) World 2000 held from April 9-14 in New Orleans, Louisiana,
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The surgeries in 1999 were conducted in Qinghai, Gansu, and
Hebei provinces, theGuangxi Zhuang Nationality Autonomous Region,
and the municipality of Tianjin and the 4,000 surgeries done in
2000 will be expanded into the provinces of Yunnan and Zhejiang
and will continue in Guangxi and Hebei, Baxter said.
</P>
<P>
The Smile Train is an international children's charity
committed to the eradication of cleft lips and palates. Through
partnerships with leading cleft organizations, medical
institutions and charitable associations, The Smile Train works to
improve the lives of millions of people around the world who are
born with cleft lips and palates.
</P>
<P>
The overall goal of The Smile Train is supported by three
primary initiatives: providing free surgeries for children who
would otherwise not receive medical treatment, training medical
professionals to enhance their proficiency in treating clefts, and
funding research to find causes of and cures for cleft lips and
palate anomalies.
</P>
<P>
Unlike other cleft organizations that rely on American
surgeons to perform surgery in foreign countries, The Smile Train
believes that local self-sufficiency is the only realistic, cost-
effective answer to the problem.
</P>
<P>
Throughout partnerships with a myriad of organizations that
are dedicated to helping children born with clefts, The Smile
Train helps to deliver smiles in 26 countries around the world,
including China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has been supportive of this programme
and it is very successful in China, said the president of The
Smile Train.
</P>
<P>
In a historic visit to the United States in 1997, Chinese
President Jiang Zemin set aside time to discuss The Smile Train
with Charles B. Wang, chairman and chief executive officer of CA
and funding board member of The Smile Train. During their meeting,
President Jiang Zemin endorsed The Smile Train programme in China
and promised to support it.
</P>
<P>
The Smile Train has forged an effective partnership with the
China Charity Federation (CCF) to establish an infrastructure
through which safe and successful surgeries can be funded now and
in the future, said Bexter.
</P>
<P>
The CCF established an infrastructure within China through
which The Smile Train can fund surgeries. It assists in the
selection of medical institutions to perform safe and successful
surgeries and in managing the identification of surgical
candidates, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Smile Train will continue to train and update surgeons in
China and work with the Ministry of Health to take Chinese cleft
care to even the most remote areas of China, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Charles B. Wang is a founding director and one of the driving
forces behind The Smile Train, Bexter said.
</P>
<P>
Ever since he was first introduced to the miraculous and
immediate results of life-changing cleft surgery in 1994, Charles
has been a passionate, tireless and fervent supporter.
</P>
<P>
Beginning with his initial leadership gift of 10 million U.S.
dollars, Charles has helped raise millions for The Smile Train.
Along the way, he has enlisted the help of many of his friends,
including Chinese President Jiang Zemin, former U.S. President
George Bush, General Colin Powell, and Bill Gates, chairman and
chief executive officer of Microsoft Corporation.
</P>
<P>
As one of the world's most successful high-tech entrepreneurs,
Charles has a special interest in how computers and software can
help the problem of cleft. He has been actively involved in
developing The Smile Train virtual surgery project along the
innovative, interactive Cleft Curriculum Project.
</P>
<P>
"It used to be that all you could do with computers was create
spreadsheets and reports. Today, we can use them to create smiles.
There's nothing more powerful, more exciting, more rewarding than
using technology to change lives. Having the opportunity to help
give a little kid a new face and a new life is truly a blessing,"
Charles said.

<HEADLINE> Greek Communists Protest Against U.S. Troops From Kosovo </HEADLINE>

<P>
ATHENS, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Members of Greece's Communist
Party (KKE) Tuesday protested at a northern Greek port against a U.
S. military contingent returning from the recent military exercise
in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
When KKE members attempted to block a military convoy of 80
vehicles carrying 586 U.S. troops heading south to the small port
of Gritsa, south of Thessaloniki, scuffles took place between
protesters and police, and two KKE protesters and one police
officer were reportedly injured, according to the semi-official
Athens News Agency (ANA).
</P>
<P>
KKE officials accused the police of attacking the protesters
without provocation.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. troops disembarked from the port aboard U.S. Navy
Hovercrafts before boarding three tank carriers vessels anchored
offshore.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the KKE organized similar protests against U.S.
troops when they passed through the northern Greek port of
Thessaloniki on their way to Kosovo to participate in the military
exercise, codenamed "Dynamic Response."

<HEADLINE> Car Prices In UK Likely To Fall In Shake-Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- British car buyers have over
recent years had to pay 10 to 12 percent more than those in France,
Germany and Italy for the same models.
</P>
<P>
Acting on a report by the Competition Commission, British Trade
and Industry Secretary Stephen Byers ordered manufacturers to
offer private purchasers the discounts normally available only to
fleet buyers.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that leading car companies had benefited from
a "complex monopoly situation." Together with Limitations
manufacturers imposed on their dealers, this led to higher prices
and was against the public interest.
</P>
<P>
Typically, consumer discounts average about 8 percent, while
fleet discounts range from about 17 to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Consumers Association welcomed Tuesday the findings as a
victory for its campaign against high UK car prices.
</P>
<P>
The association has long accused the UK motor industry of
operating as a monopoly and deliberately fixing new car prices.
</P>
<P>
The report found that the monopoly situation operated in favor
of 17 suppliers including Ford, Vauxhall and Rover, which together
accounted for 94 percent of new car registration in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Property Prices In Britain Cool Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The booming property market in
London and the South East appears to be cooling, according to the
latest quarterly figures from Halifax, the bank.
</P>
<P>
It said new figures showed the price of a typical London house
rose 4 percent in the first three months of this year -- less than
half the 8.5 percent growth notched up in the final quarter of
1999.
</P>
<P>
The overall rise in Britain property prices slowed in the first
three months of this year, up 3.2 percent compared with 3.6
percent in the last three months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
But there were marked variations across the regions. Prices in
the West Middlands and the south-west rose 5.1 percent and 5
percent respectively over the period.
</P>
<P>
The housing market remained "buoyant" but the four interest
rate rises since September appeared to be having an impact on
demand, the Halifax said.
</P>
<P>
However, a spokesman from the bank said, "The favorable
economic and affordability background should maintain a robust
housing market during 2000."

<HEADLINE> EU to Move Economy From Stability to Dynamism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Union Tuesday
outlined, in its economic guidelines for 2000, its aim of moving
the 15-nation bloc's economy from stability to dynamism.
</P>
<P>
The EU economy may enter a virtuous circle of vigorous output
growth, high confidence and strong job creation, said the
guidelines adopted Tuesday by the European Commission, the
executive body of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
"An annual economic growth rate of around 3 percent for the EU
as a whole," stated the 45-page guidelines, "should be a realistic
prospect for the coming years."
</P>
<P>
The union Tuesday forecast an economic growth of 3.4 percent
for this year and a 3.1 percent increase for the next.
</P>
<P>
The gross domestic product growth rate for 2000 is forecast to
reach 3.4 percent for both the 15-nation European Union and the 11-
nation euro zone and the forecast is to be justified by strong
internal demand, recovery of exports, sound capital investment and
increased employment in the past year and this year, according to
Pedro Solbes Mira, EU economy commissioner.
</P>
<P>
The EU, however, has to cope well with the challenges in order
to materialize the guidelines. The challenges include the return
to full employment, the transition to a knowledge-based economy,
the impact of a rapidly aging population and the improvement of
social cohesion.
</P>
<P>
Solbes described the guidelines as a "key to coordination" as
the EU wanted the union's economy to move from stability to
dynamism.
</P>
<P>
The projection of economic growth of 3.4 percent this year and
3.1 percent next year is justified by growing internal demand,
recovery of exports, sound and strong capital investment and
recovering employment, said Solbes.
</P>
<P>
The union predicted an increase of around 3 percent in the
sector of private consumption and an increase of employment by 1.3
percent and of real wages by 1.1 percent. The increase of wages
will raise personal income and consumption sentiment.
</P>
<P>
The 3.4- and 3.1-percent growths have already been revised
according to the price hikes of the oil prices on the
international markets and the performance of inflation in the
union, according to the commissioner.

<HEADLINE> EU Considers More Food Aid to Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Union said Tuesday
that it is considering sending this year another 150,000 tons of
food to Ethiopia to alleviate the drought-caused famine.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, 70,000 tons will be provided to the non-
governmental organizations that are doing the relief in the
African country while 80,000 tons will be given to the World Food
Program.
</P>
<P>
Another 110,000 tons of food will be delivered at the beginning
of next year to the Ethiopian government for the replenishment of
the country's strategic food reserve.
</P>
<P>
Altogether the 15-nation European bloc will have furnished 432,
000 tons of food aid to Ethiopia in 2000 alone.
</P>
<P>
A first shipment of 30,000 tons of food aid has just arrived in
Djibouti. This followed a decision by the European Commission, the
executive body of the European Union, to allocate 60,000 tons of
food aid for Ethiopia to be distributed by European non-
governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
The EU will be once more in the forefront of the international
community as donor of food aid to Ethiopia as it has continually
been in the past 25 years.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Calls for Concerted South Effort to Defend Right to Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Cuba, the host country of the
South Summit, Tuesday called upon developing countries to make
concerted efforts to forcefully defend the right of the South to
development, an essential condition for achieving peace in the
world, against "the unjust and unsustainable" international
economic system.
</P>
<P>
Delivering his welcoming statement at the opening session of
the meeting of foreign ministers, Cuban Foreign Minister Felipe
Perez Roque said, "We will coordinate our positions and our
demands, and afterwards we will go together to address the
developed countries."
</P>
<P>
"The economic and financial system is unjust and unsustainable,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
"What is the use of an economic system that does not guarantee
employment, nor protect the environment, and rather than reducing
poverty, actually increase it; a system that does not ensure
education and health for everyone? What is the use of a system in
which the elderly are superfluous and a growing number of children
work or turn to prostitution?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
"What is the use of a system in which speculators make
fabulous fortunes, and those who work in the real economy -- in
agriculture, mining and industry -- do not have enough to eat?" he
asked.
</P>
<P>
"The summit should resolutely demand that solidarity is
globalized, not injustice," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting must forcefully demand our peoples' right to
development, an essential condition for achieving peace on the
Planet, even more so now that criticism is growing of the
consequences for our economies, of the unjust neoliberal politics
which have been dogmatically imposed for more than a decade now,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Fair trade that promotes our development, and not free fierce
trade," he said. "Respect for diversity, and recognition and
support for the most vulnerable!"
</P>
<P>
"A solution to the problem of our external debt, and not just
inadequate alternatives -- that is what we are asking for," he
said. "Access to the markets of the North of our products, and
fair prices -- that is what we need!"
</P>
<P>
"Why do they talk of trade liberalization, whilst making it
ever more difficult for us to access the knowledge and new
technologies, which are essential if we are to compete?" he asked
again.
</P>
<P>
"At the summit, we must demand that policies are adopted which
really do encourage the transfer of modern technologies to our
countries, along with the resources needed to adequately train and
qualify our workers -- the only possible way of ensuring that they
remain in our countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We must put a stop to the dangerous tendency of privatizing
knowledge in the world, and we must demand that scientific
research is truly geared towards finding a solution to the
pressing problems which are facing humanity, and does not just aim
to satisfy the superfluous luxuries and whims of a privileged
minority," he said.
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Cuban foreign minister said that the South
Summit "must declare our desire that the World Trade Organization
promotes an in-depth and extensive debate, which takes our
opinions and interests into account."
</P>
<P>
 "The Organization cannot be owned by a small group of
developed countries!" he said. "The World Trade Organization has
to belong to all the countries that created it!"
</P>
<P>
 "We need the official development assistance, and that can
only come to us from the developed countries, which are the ones
that have the money," he said. "Our meeting must forcefully demand
that the developed countries fulfill their promise, which they
undertook in 1970, to devote 0.7 percent of their GDP (gross
domestic product) to official development assistance."
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. General Assembly, in 1970, established the goal for
wealthy countries to earmark 0.7 percent of their GDP for
assistance to developing countries, but only very few developed
countries have kept their commitment over the past decades.
</P>
<P>
"In order to find rational and viable solutions to these
problems, dialogue between the North and the South is essential,"
he said. "However, our meeting will have to make it clear that
this dialogue must be developed from a basis of respect and
equality, not by imposing the interests of the strongest."
</P>
<P>
"The summit will give new impetus to cooperation among
ourselves, but we must recognize that this will not solve our
serious problems, and that we are going to be met by the almost
insurmountable obstacle of the lack of finance needed to see these
programs through," he said. "South-South cooperation must also
receive encouragement and resources from the countries of the
North."
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers, together with their respective heads of
state or government, are here to attend the South Summit, slated
for April 10-14. They are to discuss globalization, knowledge and
technology, the South-South cooperation and the North-South
relations.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials began a working meeting Monday morning to
hammer out the two draft documents to be adopted at the end of the
summit on April 14. Foreign ministers will consider the drafts and
then forward them to the approval of heads of state and government
when they begin to meet for three days Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Although the G-77 membership grew to 133 countries over the
past decades, the original name of the body, set up by 77
developing countries in June 1964 in Geneva, was retained due to
its historic significance.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Warmly Welcomed in Havana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Cuban leader Fidel Castro Tuesday
gave a red-carpet welcome to visiting U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, who arrived here Monday night on the first visit to the
Caribbean Island country by a U.N. chief for nearly 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was held at the Revolution Square, just outside
the Revolution Palace in Havana, where the two sides later held
talks.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who flew into Havana after his trips to Geneva, Rome
and Florence, paid an official visit to Cuba on April 11 and will
then attend the current South Summit of the Group of 77 (G-77) in
Havana on April 12-13.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, Annan was greeted by Castro at the Havana
airport. The U.N. chief is scheduled to visit a university and a
historic center in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The last U.N. secretary-general to visit Cuba was Javier Perez
de Cuellar in May 1985.
</P>
<P>
Palestine leader Yasser Arafat, President Robert Mugabe of
Zimbabwe and President Cassam Uteem of Mauritius arrived in Havana
Monday night, and they were greeted by Jose Ramon Fernandez, vice
chairman of the Cuban Council of Ministers. They, together with
leaders from other African, Asian and Latin American countries,
are here to attend the South Summit, scheduled for April 10-14.
</P>
<P>
The current summit is the first ever summit and the largest
gathering in the history of the Group of 77, which, founded in
1964 by 77 developing countries, now has 133 members. It is the
largest Third World coalition in the United Nations and serves as
a focal point for the developing world to promote its collective
interests and enhance its joint negotiating capacity on
international economic issues.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Fair Play, A Must in Globalization (by Gu Zhenqiu) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Developing countries are
complaining that they are suffering from negative consequences of
globalization and they have been calling for global governance in
order to ensure fairness, equality, democracy and diversification
in the process.
</P>
<P>
Concerns about globalization arise basically from the belief
that there is no one in charge. The uneven impact of globalization
is thus a main area of concern, for the developing South in
particular. In fact, developing countries started to reflect on
the impact of globalization since the Asian financial crisis,
which began in Southeast Asia in 1997 and later spread to Russia
and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Such a worrying development rebutted an argument by supporters
of globalization that it was a panacea for all economic
difficulties faced by developing countries. Developing countries,
being marginalized by the process, mostly agreed that
globalization is in many ways a new form of economic colonialism
and represents the success of ravenous capitalism.
</P>
<P>
The reality which worries the South a lot is that the world
economy is not global at present. For example, trade, investment
and financial flows are, to a large extent, concentrated within
the developed blocs. The vast, cheap labor pools of developing
countries are being exploited by multinational corporations, and
the commodity prices are manipulated and constantly lowered to
ensure the developed world a continued supply of cheap raw
materials.
</P>
<P>
Currently, what is sadly striking is that the markets of
developing countries are being pried open in the name of trade
liberation, while the developed economies limit access to their
own markets. As a result, a large majority of developing countries
suffered the negative consequences of globalization, but had
virtually no role in defining the rules of the game.
</P>
<P>
The effects of globalization continue to extend into the daily
life of people everywhere, and the process itself has engendered
in many a sense of powerlessness and loss of control. At the same
time, the results of globalization to date have been a mixed bag.
</P>
<P>
Feckless and unruly growth and uneven expansion as resulting
from economic globalization have posed a new question to the
international community, namely, how to execute effective guidance
and governance of the globalization process.
</P>
<P>
Although globalization is an irreversible reality, it is also
true that its promised rewards have not materialized. There is an
increase in extremes of social inequality at all levels.
</P>
<P>
Growth in developing countries in the 1990s was lower than the
5.7 percent of the 1970s. One fifth of the world's population,
living in wealthy countries, accounted for 86 percent of
globalization production. With such a complex context,
understanding globalization is of vital significance for
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Even worse, globalization and interdependence challenge
certain aspects of state sovereignty, particularly that of small
and weak countries. In other words, it is clear that globalization
leads to a reduction of the sovereignty of states, with the
weakest and the smallest being the biggest losers.
</P>
<P>
Sadly lacking in the arguments for globalization is the need
to provide for the pace, direction and content of liberalization,
given diverse national levels of development and the need to build
up national capacities.
</P>
<P>
Putting the negative effects into perspective, many developing
countries are calling for world governance in the process so that
a safety mechanism can be set up to protect the interests of
developing countries at large.
</P>
<P>
The globalization process so far has advanced on the basis of
market economy and been driven by profits. It is inequitable by
its very nature.
</P>
<P>
The government of one country can redress market-born domestic
inequality through domestic policies and regulations. Likewise,
global inequality should be redressed through effective global
governance, instead of being allowed to go unchecked.
</P>
<P>
Global governance needs a global perspective, not a Western
one. The developing South has repeatedly voiced the hope that
global governance will fully embody fairness, equality, democracy
and diversification and will promote common prosperity and
development throughout the world.

<HEADLINE> Algerian President to Visit France in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Algerian President Abdelaziz
Bouteflika will make a state visit to France from June 14 to 16,
Agence France-Presse quoted official sources as saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking under anonymity, the official sources said that the
visit by Bouteflika to Paris will be followed by official visits
to Algiers by French President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin.
</P>
<P>
However, neither the French government nor the Algerian
government has confirmed the dates of the visit yet.
</P>
<P>
If realized, the visit by Bouteflika will be the second ever
made to France by an Algerian head of state after President Chadli
Bendjedid in November 1983.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Algeria and France are closely woven but
highly sensitive nearly 40 years after Algeria won its
independence from France.
</P>
<P>
France was accused by Algeria of trying to interfere into its
internal affairs when the north African country went through a
bloody civil conflict starting from 1992.
</P>

Relations between the two countries have been improving after
Bouteflika came to power one year ago.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Becomes WTO's 136th Member </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Jordan becomes the 136th member of
the World Trade Organization (WTO) on April 11, the trade body
announced here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"This is truly a historical moment for Jordan, as we have long
aspired to become a member of the WTO," said R.M. Halaiqah, chief
negotiator and secretary general of the Ministry of Industry and
Trade of Jordan at the WTO's General Council meeting. "This is a
turning point in the continued development of the Jordanian
economy."
</P>
<P>
The WTO's General Council concluded negotiations with Jordan
and approved the accession package on December 17, 1999. Jordan
has agreed to assume all of its WTO obligations upon accession. In
addition, it has signed on to the two plurilateral agreements on
government procurement and on trade on civil aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the WTO's working party on Jordan K. Kesavapany of
Singapore noted that Jordan's accession was testimony to the fact
that the accession procedures under the WTO do work rapidly and
smoothly given the determination of acceding government to push
ahead and the cooperation and flexibility of members.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's main merchandise exports include phosphate and potash,
and chemicals. Jordan mainly imports transport equipment,
machinery and crude oil. Its major trading partners are other Arab
countries and the European Union.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Calls for Debt Relief for Poor Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo Tuesday said that rich countries should erase their debts
to the poor countries, which should not be paid at the cost of
economic and social development in the developing South.
</P>
<P>
The president, who is also chairman of the Group of 77 (G-77),
told a press conference here that the South cooperation is
essential to the decisions the developing countries take regarding
the globalization of world economy, access to technology and the
relations between the North and the South.
</P>
<P>
He also said that delegations to the South Summit, the largest
gathering of heads of state and government in the 36-year history
of G-77, are discussing the implementation of some kind of follow-
up mechanism for the agreement taken at the ministerial or summit
level.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo arrived in Havana, capital of Cuba which is the host
country of the G-77 summit, Monday. He is expected to chair the
summit, at which heads of state and government will meet for three
days beginning Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian president said that if he goes to villagers and
tells them, "I wanted to give you water but I have to pay debts ...
even though the origin of these debts are dubious, and therefore I
will not be able to give you water ... they will say 'get away
with your new dispensation,'" he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he ruled out a joint decision by poor countries to
suspend debt payments, saying that it would interfere with aid
transfer that some nations depend upon for part of their domestic
budgets.
</P>
<P>
The statement by Obasanjo also coincided with the ideas in the
draft documents, which are expected to emerge from the South
Summit and call for giving poor countries a greater voice in
development decisions by encouraging the United Nations to play a
bigger role in economic aid, rather than channeling it through
organizations controlled by rich nations.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Calls for Erase of Debt for Poor Countries  (Updated with Nigerian FM's statement) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo Tuesday said that rich countries should erase their debts
to the poor countries, which should not be paid at the cost of
economic and social development in the developing South.
</P>
<P>
The president, who is also chairman of the Group of 77 (G-77),
told a press conference here that the South cooperation is
essential to the decisions the developing countries take regarding
the globalization of world economy, access to technology and the
relations between the North and the South.
</P>
<P>
He also said that delegations to the South Summit, the largest
gathering of heads of state and government in the 36-year history
of G-77, are discussing the implementation of some kind of follow-
up mechanism for the agreement taken at the ministerial or summit
level.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo arrived in Havana, capital of Cuba which is the host
country of the G-77 summit, Monday. He is expected to chair the
summit, at which heads of state and government will meet for three
days beginning Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian president said that if he goes to villagers and
tells them, "I wanted to give you water but I have to pay debts ...
even though the origin of these debts are dubious, and therefore I
will not be able to give you water ... they will say 'get away
with your new dispensation'," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he ruled out a joint decision by poor countries to
suspend debt payments, saying that it would interfere with aid
transfer that some nations depend upon for part of their domestic
budgets.
</P>
<P>
The statement by Obasanjo also coincided with the ideas in the
draft documents, which are expected to emerge from the South
Summit and call for giving poor countries a greater voice in
development decisions by encouraging the United Nations to play a
bigger role in economic aid, rather than channeling it through
organizations controlled by rich nations.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Foreign Minister Alhaji Sule Lamido Monday told an
opening session of the meeting of foreign ministers that the
Havana Declaration, one of the final documents to be adopted at
the end of the South Summit on April 14, "will demonstrate to the
entire world our purpose and determination to promote and foster
cooperation among our countries."
</P>
<P>
The second final document -- the Program of Action, which, he
said, "we hope will include all of our priorities: South-South
cooperation, globalization of the economy and our relations with
the North."
</P>
<P>
The drafts also called on rich countries to give preferential
trade concessions to poorer nations and to liberalize rules on
movements of labor as they have with movement of capital.
</P>
<P>
The Group of 77, set up by 77 developing countries, saw its
membership grow to 133 countries over the past three decades, but
its original name was retained due to its historic significance.

<HEADLINE> Meningitis Curbed in Parts of Ethiopia: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia has curbed the
meningitis epidemic that surfaced in the states of Amharic, Tigray
and Gambella, the Ethiopian News Agency quoted a Health Ministry
official as saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Vaccination services were provided to more than 80,000 people
in the affected areas, epidemic disease expert Belay Teklu said.
</P>
<P>
According to Belay, 14 out of 221 people who got the infections
have died of meningitis.
</P>
<P>
"The number of meningitis victims could have been much bigger
had it not been for the preventive measures timely taken," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Despite of medicines supplied to the affected areas, the expert
warned that it might be possible for another pandemic disease
because of the unusually prolonged dry weather conducive for the
spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is said to have fallen geographically in the
african-meningitis belt.

<P>
HARARE, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The devastating floods caused by
ravaging Cyclone Eline in March have resulted in a damage of more
than 55 million U. S. dollars for Zimbabwe, a high-ranking
official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Not only crops, roads, bridges and livestock were destroyed,
but also homes and lives were lost, said Local Government and
National Housing Minister John Nkome.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, 100 people were killed in the
country and more than 200,000 were left homeless in Masvingo,
Matabeleland and Manicaland provinces during the disaster.
</P>
<P>
Nkome said these figures were not conclusive because his
ministry, together with the affected organizations and
departments, was still doing a more analytical assessment.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is drafting a second domestic and international appeal
for donations, which would be released within the next month, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the reconstruction would be in three phases, starting
with the rebuilding of homes and opening access routes to
villages, schools and health facilities.
</P>
<P>
The short and long term phases would involve the rebuilding and
 repairing of roads and bridges, he added.

<P>
HARARE, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Parliament of Zimbabwe will be
 dissolved with effect from midnight on Tuesday, President Robert
Mugabe announced in an extraordinary government gazette released
ahead of parliamentary general elections to be held next month.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, who is now in Cuba for G-77 Summit, made the
proclamation on April 8 under Subsection two of Section 63 of the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
This section empowers the president to dissolve the parliament
at any time by a proclamation in the gazette.
</P>
<P>
The current Fourth Parliament is the last one before the 2000
general elections.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front
(Zanu-pf) has been in power since the country attained its
independence in 1980. It faces a serious challenge from the
opposition Movement for Democratic Change which was formed last
year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts predict that the composition of the House would be
changed soon after the elections as they foresee an increasing
number of members of the parliament from opposition political
parties.
</P>
<P>
The last 150-member chamber has only two members from the
opposition Zanu (Ndonga) party and one independent.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Parliamentarians Call on People to Shun Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean parliamentarians
Tuesday urged people in the country to shun violence in the face
of the elections scheduled for next month.
</P>
<P>
Violence begot violence and Zimbabweans started to lose as a
people, said Member of the Parliament (MP) Mike Mataure.
</P>
<P>
"We should approach elections in a tolerant manner and compete
effectively," he said, urging people to have a tolerant attitude
towards those with different opinions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, MP Margaret Dongo said something had to be done to
curb the violence.
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement agents should not be partisan, but be
professional in carrying out their duties, she said.
</P>
<P>
She suggested that all political leaders should have a special
conference to assess how to deal with the issue of political
violence which she said stemmed from selfish leaders who wanted to
further their aims.
</P>
<P>
MP Livingstone Manhombo said it was a great shame that as
Zimbabweans, even before they knew the actual date for elections,
began to unleash violence against each other.
</P>
<P>
"No Zimbabwean should encourage others to call for political
violence," he said, adding that "this is a time when police,
without fear or favour, should unleash all the powers invested in
them against perpetrators of violence."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that more than 120 people have been arrested in
almost 100 cases of political violence, during which three people
were killed and 100 others injured.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Crime Surveillance Network Launched in Johannesburg </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A closed circuit television
system aimed at fighting crime was officially launched in the
central business district of Johannesburg, South Africa, on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The project, initiated by Business Against Crime, the
Johannesburg Surveillance Unit, the Gauteng government, the
Greater Johannesburg Metropolitan Council and the police, aims to
slash crime in the Johannesburg area by more than 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
Gauteng Premier Mbhazima Shilowa said at the launching ceremony
that the system marked another milestone in fighting crime and
providing adequate security in the Johannesburg area.
</P>
<P>
"This project will further equip police and other law
enforcement agencies with a weapon that will enable them to
respond rapidly to crime scenes, not only to arrest criminals but
also to prevent crime," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe if private companies which already have their own
cameras installed at their properties could extend their use by
linking them up with our operation at the centre, we could cover a
wider area," he added.
</P>
<P>
This move, he said, was in addition to other plans the city
would be putting in place to enhance the capacity of law
enforcement agencies, including traffic police, to combat crime.
</P>
<P>
According to Shilowa, 25 million rand (about 380,000 U.S.
dollars) would be spent from this year's budget to procure motor
vehicles to increase the capacity of traffic police to patrol
roads.
</P>
<P>
"Crime is an enemy to our freedom, it is a threat to our peace
and a deterrent to efforts of poverty alleviation, economic
empowerment, job creation and quality service delivery," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the cameras would assist the criminal justice system by
 providing scientific evidence which could be used to convict
criminals and are part of the government's overall strategy in the
fight against criminals who threaten economic progress.
</P>
<P>
In the first phase of the multi-million rand project, 12
strategically located cameras were installed to cover areas like
Park Station between Noord, Jeppe, Klein and Von Brandis streets.
</P>
<P>
The cameras, each having a zooming capacity of up to two
kilometers and a swivelling range of 360 degrees, are linked via
fibre optic cabling to a control center which operates 24 hours a
day from the Carlton Centre basement.
</P>
<P>
The control centre operators can communicate with foot and
vehicle patrols of the police to report any crime and provide
immediate evidence of the perpetrators involved.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Map Out Refugee Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government is
 committed to formulating a written refugee policy aimed at
tackling refugee management issues looming large in the country.
</P>
<P>
Officiating a three-day workshop on refugee law and policy held
here on Tuesday for decision-makers from Kenya, Uganda and
Tanzania, Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Home Affairs
Bernard Mchomvu said the absence of such a policy is causing
misinterpretation of some stakeholders and interested parties over
refugee problems.
</P>
<P>
The refugee policy will be mapped out by next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Mchomvu, Tanzania does not have a written-down
refugee policy, but only a municipal law governing refugee matters
called the Refugees Act 1998.
</P>
<P>
The refugee influx is currently a big burden for Tanzania,
which alone hosts over 800,000 refugees from countries like
Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Somalia.
</P>
<P>
All prisons in the west regions of Tanzania are congested with
inmates as a result of increasing number of refugees jailed for
committing criminal offences.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that over 26,000 refugees have been naturalized
since 1961.

<P>
ANKARA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Sea accidents totalling 502
occurred in the Turkish Straits in the past 50 years, killing 130
people, reported the Anatolia News Agency on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Out of the total figure, 40 were defined as "big accidents,"
officials of the Chamber of Maritime Trade in Izmir, southeast
Turkey, were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Among the disasters, 386 took place in the Bosphorus Strait, 85
in Dardanelles Strait and the rest in the Sea of Marmara.
</P>
<P>
Turkey lies between Asia and Europe being surrounded by the sea
on three sides -- the Mediterranean in the south, the Aegean in the
west and the Black Sea in the north. The two continents are
separated by the Turkish Straits, consisting from southwest to
northeast, of the Dardanelles, the Sea of Marmara and the
Bosphorus.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that altogether 22,000 ships were destroyed
and thousands of tons of oil spilled into the sea, which caused
grave environment pollution.
</P>
<P>
As nearly 50,000 ships, including huge oil tankers, passed the
Turkish Straits every year in the half century, the officials
complained, Turkey could hardly do anything in connection with the
ships, which went through the straits in accordance with the
Montreux Convention (MONCON), signed in the Canadian city in 1936.
</P>
<P>
Under relevant MONCON provisions, commercial ships are entitled
to free passage through the waterway, with or without piloting,
regardless of their loads.

</P>
<P>
The summit, scheduled on June 12-14, will be the first

</P>
<P>
"We hope it will contribute to the development of a peaceful
resolution of the conflict in the Korean Peninsula," the statement
added.
</P>
<P>
"Israel also hopes that the harsh current reality of separation
between the two parts of the Korean people will be replaced, at the
end of the process, by cooperation, peace and prosperity," it said.
</P>
<P>
It was announced on Monday that the DPRK leader Kim Jong-il will

<HEADLINE> Iran Seizes 10 Oil Tankers Smuggling Iraqi Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The patrol boats of the Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) of Iran seized 10 oil tankers
smuggling oil from Iraq on Monday and Tuesday, the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The tankers, now anchored in the coast of an Iranian island,
were carrying a consignment of 45,000 tons of smuggled oil from
Iraq, said IRGC officer Isa Golverdi.
</P>
<P>
He said the tankers of different nationalities were involved in
smuggling oil and violating Iranian territorial waters, adding that
the documents of over 100 crew members on board the 10 tankers have
also been collected.
</P>
<P>
Tehran will not permit the use of Iranian territorial waters for
the smuggling of oil, the officer stressed.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, which has been under crippling U.N. sanctions since its
1990 invasion of Kuwait, was banned from selling oil, its major
foreign currency earner, on world market.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. humanitarian oil-for-food program which took
effect in 1996 to ease the sufferings of the Iraqi ordinary people,
Iraq is allowed to sell oil only under the U.N. control, with the
proceeds used to fund humanitarian programs and the Gulf War
reparations.
</P>
<P>
The United States and its allies have repeatedly accused Baghdad
of smuggling refined oil out of its Basra and Abu Flus ports. And
Iran is also under fire for allowing smuggled Iraqi oil to pass
through its territory in return for kickbacks.
</P>
<P>
Over the past week, the IRGC have detained a Honduran-flagged
vessel and a tanker flying the Panamanian flag for allegedly trying
to smuggle Iraqi oil in violation of the U.N. sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Urges Trade-Law Harmonization in E. Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Senior Minister Lee
Kuan Yew Tuesday stressed the need for East Asian countries to
develop a congruence between laws and rules governing trade and
investment so as to ensure stability, predictability and low
transaction costs in economic activities.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Millennium Law Conference gala dinner hosted by
Singapore Academy of Law, Lee said, "To maximize growth potential,
East Asian countries need to harmonize those parts of their legal
systems that concern cross-border trade."
</P>
<P>
He said this is especially important in view of the fact that
East Asian countries are at different levels of economic
development and do not have similar political systems, historical
origins and common legal roots.
</P>
<P>
"There is a fundamental need for the rule of law. It ensures
stability and predictability," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lee added that the ASEAN Free Trade Area and the ASEAN
Investment Area can be a possible vehicle for this process of
harmonization and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation can also
play a role in this regard.
</P>
<P>
"These regional groupings can promote the adoption of
international standards which will facilitate the integration of
economies," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which suffered
a setback at its ministerial meeting in Seattle last November, Lee
said, "WTO obligations, together with compulsory dispute
resolution mechanisms, must be the way ahead." "Its emphasis on
upholding agreed rules and regulations will ensure that the rule
of law will be established for international transactions and the
international trading system will be more secure and predictable."
</P>
<P>
The three-day Singapore Law Conference with the theme of "
leading the law and lawyers into the new millennium" is attended
by some 500 people including more than 80 foreign delegates from
19 countries or areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 11 (Xinhua) -- King Bhumibol Adulyadej of
Thailand Tuesday approved the new cabinet list submitted by Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai, according to local radio reports.
</P>
<P>
Six cabinet seats were changed during the government reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Banyat Bantadtan, deputy leader of the ruling Democrat Party,
was named as deputy prime minister and interior minister to
replace Sanan Kachornprasart, who resigned earlier this month
after being accused of falsifying his assets and liabilities
records.
</P>
<P>
The other cabinet shifts were made within another ruling party,
Chart Thai.
</P>
<P>
Viroj Pao-in, a parliament representative of Chart Thai,
replaced Panja Kesornthong as deputy prime minister who had
resigned due to health problems.
</P>
<P>
Pongpol Adireksarn, the party's secretary-general, was ousted
from the cabinet as agriculture and cooperatives minister because
of soured relationship with party leader Banharn Silpa-Archa.
</P>
<P>
Pongpol's post was taken over by Praphat Phothisuthon, a deputy
interior minister, whose job was taken over by Sonthaya Khunpluem,
a deputy transport and communications minister.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Labor Minister Jongchai Thiangtham was moved to Sonthaya
's job at the Transport and Communications Ministry while his job
was taken over by Prayuth Siripanich, a Chart Thai parliamentary
representative.
</P>
<P>
Chart Thai leader Banharn had said earlier that his party had
resolved not to make cabinet changes as the government's term had
only a short time left.
</P>
<P>
However, he was quoted as saying Monday that the moves were
necessary because of Panja's resignation.
</P>
<P>
The six-party coalition enjoys a comfortable majority of 237 in
the 385-member Lower House of Parliament. But it must call a
general election before November when its term expires.
</P>
<P>
New cabinet members are expected to be led by the prime
minister to an audience with the king on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Urges IMF not to Ignore Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 11 (Xinhua) -- South Africa said on Tuesday
it will press for greater say for the developing countries in the
decision-making of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
South African Finance Minister Trevor Manuel said in Cape Town
before he left for Washington for the spring meetings of the IMF
and the World Bank that he was particularly concerned about the
dominance of the United States and Europe Union in the
decision-making in the two organizations.
</P>
<P>
"The structure and operations of the IMF and the World Bank are
unsuited to the global economy in the year 2000. The poor
countries are completely ignored, it is wrong for this very cosy
agreement to exclude the majority of the world's people," he said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa will continue to campaign for the write-off of
some poor countries' debt at the meeting, Manuel added.

<HEADLINE> G-77 Foreign Ministers Hold Preparatory Meeting for South Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers from the Group
of 77 countries met Tuesday here to prepare for the next day's
South Summit, the largest gathering of heads of state and
government since the founding of the body in 1964.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from 133 G-77 member states are also expected
to ponder over the two final draft documents -- the Declaration
and the Program of Action, which will collectively address the
negative impact of globalization on developing countries, the
current unjust international economic system, and poorer nations'
heavy debt burden.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was launched by Nigerian Foreign Minister Alhaji
Sule Lamido, whose country holds the G-77 chairmanship for the
year 2000. He said that the Summit will focus on globalization,
knowledge and technology, the South-South cooperation, and the
North-South relations.
</P>
<P>
Delivering welcoming statement at the opening session, Cuban
Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Rouqe said the time has come for the
Third World countries to work hard to help people out of
starvation and stand up to the challenge imposed by the current
unjust international economic system.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers are here to attend the South Summit,
scheduled for April 10-14, together with their respective head of
state or government. They will discuss the role of the United
Nations in the 21st century on Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Working meetings of senior officials began in the morning and
lasted into late Monday night. Talks by heads of state are to take
place Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"This summit will give a new emphasis on cooperation among
ourselves," the Cuban foreign minister said, adding that the South-
South cooperation cannot make progress without the North.
</P>
<P>
G-77 was founded on June 15, 1964 by 77 developing countries in
Geneva. Although its current membership has increased to 133
countries, the original name was retained because of its historic
significance.
</P>
<P>
As the largest Third World coalition in the United Nations and
the largest grouping in the South, the organization provides means
for the developing world to articulate and promote its collective
economic interests and enhance its joint negotiating capacity on
all major international economic issues in the United Nations
system, and promote economic and technical cooperation among
developing countries.

<HEADLINE> EU Forecasts 3.4 Percent Economic Growth for 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) on
Tuesday forecast an economic growth of 3.4 percent for this year
and 3.1 percent for next year.
</P>
<P>
The growth of the gross domestic product for 2000 is estimated
at 3.4 percent for both the 15-nation EU and the 11-nation euro
zone, according to the forecast.
</P>
<P>
The forecast was justified by strong internal demand, recovery
of exports, sound capital investment and increased employment in
the past year and this year, said Pedro Solbes Mira, EU economy
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
Though not as strong as the increase in the United States, the
EU experienced strong growth of its own, Solbes said.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of last year was 2.3 percent, with the fourth
quarter witnessing 0.8 percent and 0.9 percent of growth in the EU
and the euro zone respectively.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's forecast projected an increase of around 3 percent in
the sector of private consumption, a 1.3-percent rise in
employment and a 1.1-percent increase in real wages.
</P>
<P>
The increase of wages will raise personal income and
consumption sentiment, according to Solbes.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference televised live to Brussels from
Strasbourg that in the three-year period from 1999 to 2001, a
total of 6 million jobs will be created to ride the economic
growth thrust.
</P>
<P>
"Unemployment will go down to a level not seen since the
recession years in 1992 and 1993," said Solbes, who briefed the
European Parliament about the economic forecast and the general
guidelines of the economic policies of the EU and its member
states.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate for both the EU and the euro zone is now
just below 10 percent and with the new forecast, the jobless rate
is expected to drop to near 8 percent within two years, he added.
</P>
<P>
Solbes said that both the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development and the International Monetary Fund gave lower
forecast for the year 2001 than that for 2000 and the development
elsewhere will exert influence on the EU.

<HEADLINE> Finnish NGO Calls for More Aid to Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Finland's non-governmental
Service Center for Development Cooperation on Monday urged Finnish
parliament to increase aid to developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Jorma Kukkonen, chief of the organization, made the appeal in
an article published in Helsingin Sanomat (Helsinki News), the
largest newspaper in Finland.
</P>
<P>
He said the gravest human right problem is poverty currently
prevalent in the Third World, urging the developed countries to
increase their assistance to the developing world.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the assistance in the 1980s, aid programs today
are mostly well-planned but ill-financed, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Finnish government has failed to
provide the aid it has promised accounting for 0.4 percent of its
GDP to help the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Kukkonen urged the Finnish parliament to allocate at least 0.34
percent of the country's GDP to meet the so-called "face-saving
bottom line," and to increase the percentage of development aid in
its GDP to 0.7 percent by 2010 to meet the UN requirement.

<P>
DHAKA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Home, Post and
Telecommunications Minister Mohammad Nasim Tuesday said a
demolition drive will begin on Wednesday to remove unauthorized
toll collection houses on roads and highways across the country.
</P>
<P>
Deputy commissioners and superintendents of police have been
asked to demolish the illegal tollhouses on roads and highways
under their respective jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
The deadline set by the government for removing all illegal
tollhouses ended Tuesday, the minister told a press briefing at
his office.
</P>
<P>
He said police and Bangladesh Rifles would be on roads and
highways from Wednesday to help the demolition process. Those
involved in illegal toll collection in the name of welfare of
transport workers would be arrested under Public Safety Act, he
added.

dimension that bus terminals are now known as crime zones. The so-
called labor organizations and toll collectors who build up their
fortunes overnight are doing the business of smuggling drug and
illegal arms, he added.

<HEADLINE> EU to Form Civilian Crisis Management Instrument </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission on
Tuesday proposed setting up a civilian crisis management arm to
enable swift mobilization of police, customs officers, judges and
other non-military personnel for conflict prevention.
</P>
<P>
A Rapid Reaction Facility (RRF) should be established to
enhance the bloc's civilian capacity to intervene swiftly and
effectively in crisis points outside the union, proposed the
commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European Union.
</P>
<P>
Christopher Patten, EU commissioner for external relations,
said, "The creation of a Rapid Reaction Facility will allow us to
mobilize our resources within hours or days rather than weeks or
months."
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the main lessons learned from the experiences
the international community made in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo and
East Timor," he added.
</P>
<P>
The RRF will operate through a separate budget line reinforced
by the authority of the commission to decide quickly on urgent
interventions of up to 5 million euros (4.8 million U.S. dollars)
and each intervention will have a cost ceiling of 12 million euros
(11.5 million dollars) and a time limit of nine months.
</P>
<P>
The European Council summit in Helsinki last December called on
the commission to set up a civilian crisis management facility,
with the aim to accelerate the provision of finance to support EU
activities worldwide, to contribute to operations run by
international organizations and to fund non-governmental
organization activities.
</P>
<P>
The added value of the RRF is its speed and flexibility in
situations of high tension immediately prior to, during and after
crises, according to officials from the commission.
</P>
<P>
The activities of the RRF range from alleviation of financial
burdens, human rights work, election monitoring, institution
building, media support, border management, humanitarian missions,
mine-clearing  operations, police training and the provision of
police equipment.

</P>
<P>
Current G-77 chairman, Arthur Mbanefo, who is also Nigeria's
permanent representative to the U.N., told a press conference here
Monday afternoon that the summit would seek ways to help poorer
nations merge into an increasingly wired world of Internet
information to face the challenge of globalization at the turn of
century.
</P>
<P>
The G-77 also implied that the group may urge developed
countries to relieve poorer nations' debt burden. "We would like
to see a situation where some of this debt is canceled," he said,
adding some countries spend twice as much servicing their debt as
they do on social services.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from 133 G-77 member states are to meet at
the Havana International Conference Center Tuesday morning. Senior
officials began working meeting Monday to hammer out the final
documents which will emerge from the Summit, which is scheduled to
conclude on April 14. Heads of state and government will meet on
Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We tend to use the South Summit as an opportunity to
revitalize the South-South cooperation so as to face the challenge
of globalization," Mbanefo said.
</P>
<P>
The Summit is "unmistakable proof that our countries want our
voice to be heard, and that the interests of our countries, which
are the majority, are taken into account," Cuban Foreign Minister
Felipe Perez Roque said at a press conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
By Monday, 122 member countries have sent delegations, as had
34 nonmember countries and 35 international organizations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation, headed by Vice Premier Li Lanqing, is
scheduled to arrive here on Tuesday afternoon. China has long been
in close ties with G-77, and the Cuban foreign minister spoke
highly of China's support for the group.
</P>
<P>
Although the group, founded by 77 developing countries on June
15, 1964 in Geneva, saw its membership grown to 133 countries, the
original name was retained because of its historic significance.
</P>
<P>
As the largest grouping in the South, G-77 provides the means
for the developing world to articulate and promote its collective
economic interests and enhance its joint negotiating capacity on
all major international economic issues in the United Nations
system, and promote economic and technical cooperation among
developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Governor Criticized For Anti-Foreigner Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Japanese government
and opposition parties on Tuesday blasted Tokyo Governor Shintaro
Ishihara for his recent discriminative remarks against foreigners
living in Japan.
</P>
<P>
"Atrocious crimes have been committed again and again by
sangokujin (people from Taiwan or Korea or their descendants) and
other foreigners. We can expect them to riot in the event of a
disastrous earthquake," Ishihara said Sunday while addressing
members of Japan's Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF).
</P>
<P>
Ishihara also called on the GSDF to control the possible
rioting by foreigners following a major earthquake.
</P>
<P>
"There may be people who have perceived that their honor has
been stained by that word," Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono
said when referring to Ishihara's use of the word "sangokujin."
</P>
<P>
"I believe we should not use the word carelessly," Kono told a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
At a separate news conference, Japanese Defense Agency Director-
General Tsutomu Kawara flatly dismissed Ishihara's views on the
possibility of rioting by foreigners.
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, I don't believe that would happen," Kawara said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, leaders of the Japanese opposition parties strongly
criticized Ishihara for his remarks.
</P>
<P>
"It's an absurd comment and must not be forgiven. I feel fierce
indignation," said Yukio Hatoyama, leader of the Democratic Party
of Japan (DPJ).
</P>
<P>
The Social Democratic Party (SDP), in a statement, urged
Ishihara to apologize for the comment.
</P>
<P>
Ishihara "made the comment to encourage racial discrimination
on purpose. It must not be overlooked. We want him to immediately
withdraw the comment and apologize," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Sankokujin," a Japanese term that literally means "people from
third- world countries," gained currency after World War II. It is
now widely regarded as a derogatory term which refers to people
from former Japanese colonies in Taiwan and the Korean peninsula
as well as their descendants.

<P>
MOSCOW, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Azerbaijan President Geidar Aliyev
said Tuesday he hoped that the Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS) will be "effective and dynamic" under the leadership of
Russian President-elect Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan will expand mutually advantageous cooperation in the
framework of the CIS, particularly in the economic area, as each
member can greatly profit by this, Aliyev told the Itar-Tass news
agency in the capital of Baku.
</P>
<P>
He said his country expects to see stability and attainment of
economic reforms in Russia.
</P>
<P>
He added that Russia, holding a dominant position in the CIS,
should set an example for CIS countries.
</P>
<P>
In January, leaders of the CIS countries unanimously voiced
support for Putin and elected him chairman of the Council of Heads
of State of the CIS.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that Russia with its new leader will adopt a friendly
and honest policy toward all CIS countries," Aliyev said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the conviction that the new Russian president will
justify the expectations of the leaders of the CIS nations.

<HEADLINE> Romania Draws Up Medium-Term Strategy for Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Agriculture Minister
Ioan Muresan Tuesday presented a 12-year agricultural development
strategy, putting increasing production and competitiveness,
together with an overall rural development as his main and
permanent objectives.
</P>
<P>
His medium-term priorities are to turn the food industry profit-
making, to raise farmers' income and to prepare for the country's
long-expected admission into the Europe Union, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
The food industry had seen its production reduced because of
bad management, delay in privatization and failure to adjust to
the market economy, Muresan said in the strategy document.
</P>
<P>
"If a law for agriculture is created, the strategy will be
applied and its goals will be met, for the law will allow a
continuation of the strategy over several legislatures", he added.
</P>
<P>
The strategy is outlined jointly by the Agriculture Ministry, a
commission made up of cabinet members, experts designated by
parties, trade unions and employers unions.
</P>
<P>
In its nine chapters, analysis of the sector and perspectives
of joining the Europe Union are more heavily dealt with.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Current Account Surplus Posts First Rise in 13 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Japan's current account surplus in
February surged 33.3 percent from a year earlier to 1,473.7
billion yen (13.5 billion U.S. dollars), registering the first
rise in 13 months, the Finance Ministry said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The upsurge in the current account surplus came as a climb in
exports outweighed an increase in imports, the ministry said in a
preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
Exports jumped 13.9 percent to 3,948.0 billion yen (36.1
billion dollars) while imports grew 11.4 percent to 2,646.9
billion yen (24.2 billion dollars), both marking the fourth
straight month of expansion.
</P>
<P>
Japan's shipment to the United States, the 15-member European
Union and other Asian countries increased 10.8 percent, 3.2
percent and 32.1 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The surplus in goods and services trade totaled 947.0 billion
yen (8.7 billion dollars), soaring 54.6 percent for the first rise
in eight months.
</P>
<P>
The merchandise trade surplus increased 19.4 percent to 1,301.1
billion yen (11.9 billion dollars), while the services deficit
contracted to 354.1 billion yen (3.2 billion dollars) due to
scaled-back deficits in the payment of patent royalties.
</P>
<P>
The yen averaged 109.34 against the dollar in February,
compared with a rate of 116.66 yen to the U.S. dollar a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
The current account balance represents the difference between a
nation's income from foreign sources and foreign obligations
payable, excluding net capital investment.

MOSCOW, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Supreme Court on Tuesday
annulled a December 1999 decree by the former President Boris
Yeltsin to fire the then Moscow police chief Nikolai Kulikov.
</P>
<P>
The appeal board of the Court decided to do away with an
earlier Supreme Court rejection of a complaint by Moscow Mayor
Yuri Luzhkov, which declared Yeltsin's degree "illegal."
</P>
<P>
Luzhkov had argued that Nikolai Kulikov's dismissal as head of
Moscow's Chief Interior Administrator ran against the Russian
Constitution, Moscow's local law and the law on the police, which
forbid national authorities to appoint or dismiss city police
chief without the consent of the municipal government.

He said Kulikov had been appointed deputy interior minister to
"raise the status of the largest and most complicated regional

<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the Public
Interest Party of China today strongly criticized Annette Lu, a
member of the Taiwan-based Democratic Progressive Party, for her
recent remarks advocating independence of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The criticism was lodged after a meeting of the major leaders
of the Public Interest Party of China, one of the country's eight
non-Communist parties.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman pointed out that Annete Lu's definition of cross-
straits relations as that of "distant relatives" and "close
neighbors" reveals her betrayal of her motherland and angers all
Chinese people, including overseas Chinese all over the world.
</P>
<P>
The Public Interest Party of China resolutely supports the
statement made by the Taiwan Work Office of the Communist Party of
China Central Committee and the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State
Council, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Annete Lu's support of Taiwan independence reveals that she
has turned a blind eye to the fact that Taiwan is an inalienable
part of China," the spokesman said, "and whoever intends to
separate China is doomed to fail."

<P>
The spokesman also analyzed Annete Lu's comments and
underscored two "againsts": One is that Lu's support of Taiwan
independence is "against the basic interest of people on both
sides of Taiwan Straits, against the common aspiration of all
Chinese people including Taiwan people for peace, stability and
development"; the other is that her allegation is "against the
principles of international law and practice" in that the one-
China principle is generally accepted by the international
community.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman pointed out that "peaceful reunification of the
motherland is the noble pursuit of all Chinese people."
</P>
<P>
He called on all Chinese people, including overseas Chinese, to
fight against the separatist activities.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with Hong Kong Cable TV, Annette Lu
openly advocated independence for Taiwan, which challenged the one-
China policy and stirred animosity between the people on both
sides of the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that the relationship between the mainland and Taiwan
is historically like that of "distant relatives," and
geographically they are "close neighbors."
</P>
<P>
On April 8, a spokesman for the Taiwan Work Office of the
Communist Party of China Central Committee and the Taiwan Affairs
Office of the State Council refuted Annete Lu's comments by saying
that "China will by no means compromise or give in on this matter
of principle." And On April 10, People's Daily strongly criticized
Annete Lu by publishing an editorial entitled "Annete Lu Betrays
Motherland."

</P>
<P>
- No for giving up any part of the Palestinian territories
seized (by Israel) in the l967 Middle East war, including
Jerusalem;
</P>
<P>
- No for accepting settlement legitimacy;
</P>
<P>
- No for delaying discussions on such issues as Jerusalem and
refugees and for accepting a partial framework agreement;
</P>
<P>
- No for any kind of Israeli military presence inside the
(future) Palestinian State territories from Jordan river border to
joint border with Egypt;
</P>
<P>
- No for the policy of repatriating Palestinian refugees in
places other than their homeland.
</P>
<P>
The talks in Washington between Israel and the Palestinians are
aimed to conclude a framework agreement by May to pave the way for
a final peace treaty by September 2000 as well as pushing the
Israeli side to go ahead with the army redeployment in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The talks entered into the fourth day on Monday, the source
claimed, adding that there was a session on the framework
agreement, followed by a trilateral meeting with U.S. Middle East
peace envoy Denis Ross who then attended a long discussion on the
last phase of Israeli army redeployment.
</P>
<P>
About 43 percent of the West Bank has already been under partial
and full Palestinian authority.
</P>
<P>
However, the Israeli government stressed that it will not drop
its own four "NOs" with regard to giving up Jerusalem or dividing
it, dismantling big settlements, return of Palestinian refugees, or
the return to pre-l967 Mideast War borders.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak arrives in
Washington on Tuesday for talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton on
the Palestinian track of the peace process ahead of a visit to the
U.S. capital by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on April 20 for
the same purpose.

<HEADLINE> India to Launch First Vehicle Tracking System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 11 (Xinhua) -- India's first satellite-based
vehicle tracking system will be launched in the southern city of
Bangalore next week to monitor local buses, the Press Trust of
India (PTI) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The system, developed by Bharat Electronics Ltd. (BEL) of India,
will help determine the exact distance covered by buses, prevent
traffic violations by these vehicles and determine their arrival
time at a particular stop, said the PTI.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the system will also enable Bangalore
Metropolitan Transport Corporation to make correct payments to bus
owners who collect money according to the distance their vehicles
run in the service, the PTI added.
</P>
<P>
The system, whose development was funded by India's Ministry of
Information Technology, relies on the global positioning system (
GPS) for vehicle monitoring, H. Seshadri Sekhar, manager of the
BEL, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
A GPS receiver, mounted on the vehicle, continuously acquires
position data through the GPS satellites and the data will be
stored on a computer at the control station, said Sekhar.
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, the data will be downloaded to a geographical
information system, a computerized navigational system, to
determine the distance travelled by a bus and traffic violations,
he added.

MOSCOW, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The 42nd infantry division of the
Russian armed forces will be permanently deployed in the Republic
of Chechnya by May 1, a senior military official said here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Colonel General Vladislav Putilin, chief of the Mobilization
Department of the Russian General Staff, told reporters that the
division, formed by 30 percent of contract servicemen and 70
percent of conscripts, will be established and deployed in
Chechnya by May 1.
</P>
<P>
All the enlists of the division will receive a six-month
training in military training centers, he added.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Russian Central Election Commission
(CEC) tentatively scheduled the election of a state Duma (lower
house of the parliament) deputy in Chechnya for August 20. As a
single-mandate electoral district of the Russian Federation, the
republic held no parliamentary election last December due to
Russia's anti-terrorist war there.
</P>
<P>
CEC Chairman Alexander Veshnyakov said the elections of a State
Duma deputy were skipped in Chechnya on December 19, 1999 "because
of the lack of organizational and legal possibilities to hold them
during that period."

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 11 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
said Tuesday that he will discuss economic cooperation and reunion
of separated families with Kim Jung-il, leader of the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), at the forthcoming summit.
</P>
<P>
At a cabinet meeting, Kim Dae-jung said he will uphold the
spirit of the South-North Joint Communique signed on July 4, 1972,
and the 1991 South-North Basic Agreement at the inter-Korean
summit, which will be held in Pyongyang on June 12-14 this year
under an agreement reached by the two sides in China early this
month.
</P>
<P>
"Among others, I will make efforts to materialize the four
proposals that I made in Berlin," Kim said.
</P>
<P>
In Berlin on March 8 during his European trip, Kim proposed
that Seoul and Pyongyang reconcile to end the Cold War on the
Korean peninsula, conduct economic cooperation and inter-
government dialogue, allow reunions of separated families and
exchange special envoys to carry out the South-North Basic
Agreement.
</P>
<P>
South Korea will offer both humanitarian and economic aid to
the DPRK to help reconstruct the DPRK's infrastructure, Kim said.

"The economic cooperation will take the form of investment and
loans," he said.

sector to join forces to solve inter-Korean issues.
</P>
<P>
He instructed his ministers to take all necessary measures to
prepare for the summit, which will be the first-ever since the
peninsula was divided in 1945.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kim called on the South Korean political circle to
support the inter-Korean summit on a nonpartisan basis.
</P>
<P>
"The most proud thing in agreeing to the summit meeting is that
we discussed and reached an agreement on the national issues by
ourselves," added the president.

<P>
HARBIN, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts have confirmed
that a rare kind of grouse living in frigid zones is extinct in
China.
</P>
<P>
The extinct spruce grouse, belonging to the species of
ptarmigan, only inhabits coniferous forests in frigid zones.
</P>
<P>
During a five-year investigation, researchers searched all the

extinct in China," said Yu.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that the bird mainly live in southeastern part of
Siberia in Russia and northeastern part of China.
</P>
<P>
Yu attributes the extinction of the bird to fewer coniferous
forests.
</P>
<P>
Jia Jingbo, professor from Northeast China Forestry University,
said that wildlife remains a critical issue despite efforts from
the Chinese government to protect wildlife.

BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of China's
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, said today
that China sincerely wants to normalize its relationship with
Panama, and hopes that China's Panama friends will do their part
to make this happen as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks in his meeting this afternoon with Marco
Ameglio, visiting chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the
Legislative Assembly of Panama.
</P>
<P>
Consisting of chairmen of several committees under the
Legislative Assembly, the delegation is the largest of its kind to
come to China, and its presence here demonstrates that a good
relationship exists between both countries and both parliaments,
Li said.
</P>
<P>
Panama is an important country in Latin America with vital
strategic importance and its canal is of unique significance, Li
said, adding that China has long supported Panama's fight to
retrieve the ownership of the canal, and is delighted over its
smooth return to Panama last year.
</P>
<P>
China believes that the Panama people can run the canal well
and thus made contribution to the prosperity of world's sea
shipping industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
Though far apart, China and Panama have struggled for national
independence and fought for sovereign and territorial integrity.
Both are currently faced with the task of rebuilding their
countries and developing their economies, Li said.

<P>
Li noted in particular that the increasing exchange between
both parliaments has contributed significantly to the development
of their relationship.
</P>
<P>
Li welcomed the statement by Panama's government, after
President Moscoso resumed his post, that it won't support Taiwan's

Committee of the Panama Legislative Assembly last year
congratulating China on its 50th founding anniversary, "to which
we express our appreciation and gratitude."
</P>
<P>
Ameglio said that this visit is meant to push bilateral
relations forward.
</P>
<P>
It is a commonly recognized policy in Panama that Panama, with
a population of three million, and China, with 1.2 billion people,
should develop their relations, he said.

<HEADLINE> China Names 33 Ecological Demonstration Counties, Prefectures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-three countries and
prefectures across China were named today as ecological
demonstration areas by the State Environmental Protection
Administration of China (SEPA).
</P>
<P>
The areas, including Yanqing County in northern Beijing, are
the first in China to have met the economic, social, and
environmental requirements of China's sustainable development
strategy.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Guangyao, deputy director of the SEPA, said the 33 areas
were carefully chosen from 154 pilot areas, and will serve as good
examples of coordinated social, economic, and environmental
development.
</P>
<P>
Construction of ecological demonstration areas will remain an
important part of improving regional ecological conditions and an
effective way toward sustained economic and social development at
regional levels, he said.
</P>
<P>
The environmental requirements contain 19 specific development
targets, including the forest coverage rate, the consumption rate
of environment-friendly energy, and reduction in consumption of
farm chemicals and chemical fertilizers, as well as the quality of
air and water and the use of recycled solid waste.
</P>
<P>
China planned in 1995 to set up 50 ecological demonstration
counties and prefectures by the end of 2000 as part of its efforts
to curb the deterioration of the environment.
</P>
<P>
Many more of China's 2,000 counties and prefectures are
expected to meet these standards in the years ahead.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily: Fallacy of Taiwan Independence (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- China's leading newspaper, the
People's Daily, will carry a by-lined article tomorrow to refute
statements made by Taiwan's Annette Lu, advocating independence
for the island.
</P>
<P>
The article says that during the regional elections in Taiwan,
pro-independence figures promised to "ignore the issue of
reunification or independence" and to "improve cross-straits
relations" in order to win support of the Taiwan public by means
of deception.
</P>
<P>
"Even before she took office, the die-hard pro-independence
element Annette Lu showed her true colors and in public preached
her notorious remarks on the independence of Taiwan," the article
says.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with a Hong Kong media organization, Lu,
a member of the Taiwan-based Democratic Progressive Party, said
that historically, the mainland and Taiwan have been "remote
relatives," while geographically they are "close neighbors."
</P>
<P>
She said "let's not quarrel about the issue over reunification
or independence," and that she "will do everything possible to
establish the relations of remote relatives and close neighbors
between Taiwan and China."

Commenting on her remarks, the article exclaims, "How ludicrous
Lu's logic is!"
</P>
<P>
"She is showing a friendly face while harboring evil intentions
to alienate the relations of the people across the Taiwan straits,
" it points out.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan has been an integral part of China throughout history,
the Taiwan people are inseparable family members of the Chinese
nation, and people across the straits are in the same family --
not remote relatives or neighbors," the article says.
</P>
<P>
Lu's behavior has been "too crude and unprofessional,"
provoking a dispute across the straits, but still she says
innocently that she "didn't offend China," the article points out.
</P>
<P>
It goes on to expose another illogical stance taken by Lu, who
claimed that Taiwan is "a scapegoat of the historical duel between
the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party," and since the
Kuomintang is no longer in power, Taiwan is thus able to have a "
special relationship" with China, which is "one China and one
Taiwan."

The article counter-attacks her position, saying that Lu
overlooked one important factor: The change of regional leaders of
Taiwan does not alter the fact that the island is part of Chinese
territory.
</P>
<P>
"The hostile situation stemming from an unfinished civil war
will not come to an end just because the Kuomintang ruling party
in Taiwan has stepped down," the article says.
</P>
<P>
The change of leadership in Taiwan simply represents the defeat
of the Kuomintang rule, and doesn't mean that the pro-independence
elements have been victorious, it says, noting that it is just a
result of Lee Teng-hui's "slick politics."
</P>
<P>
Lu's lunatic remarks give off a dangerous signal when the
development trend of the cross-straits relations is at a
crossroads, the article warns.
</P>
<P>
It says that the Chinese people will never give full play to
the independence elements, and the new leaders in Taiwan must have
a clear and correct idea of the situations they are about to face.
</P>
<P>
"We will be closely watching the course they follow," the
article says.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Members Strongly Refute Lu's Statements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Members of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) in Hong Kong Tuesday strongly refuted Annette
Lu's statements advocating "independence of Taiwan".
</P>
<P>
Participants to a forum on the Taiwan issue said Lu's
statements deny the fact that Taiwan is an inseparable part of the
Chinese territory and that the people of Taiwan are an inseparable
part of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
Tsui Sze-man, member of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC
National Committee and director of the Hong Kong Mirror newspaper,
said that in a recent interview with a Hong Kong cable TV station,
Lu openly advocated "Taiwan independence", which challenged the
one-China principle and stirred animosity between the people on
both sides of the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Some CPPCC National Committee members said that the extremists
who do not want to see the cross-straits relationship head toward
peaceful reunification have intentionally fabricated various
stories to separate China, and Annette Lu is the most notorious.
</P>
<P>
Chuang Shih-Ping, member of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC
National Committee and honorary chairman of the Hong Kong South
Pacific Commercial Bank, noted that Lu wrongly advocated "Taiwan
independence" and even tried to rationalize Japan's occupation of
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chuang said the Chinese history and geography clearly show that
Taiwan is a part of China, and that this can never be changed. The
temporary separation of Taiwan from the motherland will inevitably
come to an end, Chuang said.
</P>
<P>
All the participants warned that anyone attempting to carry out
a "Taiwan independence" policy is doomed to fail. Annette Lu
challenged the 1.25 billion Chinese people who stand behind the
one-China principle, and she intends to push Taiwan into the abyss
of war, they said.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Minister Calls for Adherence to Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Interior Minister Abdolvahed
Mousavi Lari on Tuesday called on political factions in the country
to observe the constitution while expressing their views and
engaging in political activities.
</P>
<P>
Only those who have accepted the constitution have the right to
be politically active, to express their views and to participate in
various activities to decide the fate of the nation, Lari was
quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Admitting each group has its own remedy to cure problems facing
the society, the minister urged political parties in the country to
be tolerant to different views and positions and adhere to the
constitution, which is the common accord of the people.
</P>
<P>
Tolerance of views will contribute toward progress of society
whereas intolerance will lead to tension and undermine national
security, he said.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the recent "illegal acts" by certain groups, which
included the assassination attempt against Saeed Hajjarian, deputy
chairman of Tehran municipal council.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian, a vanguard in the country's reformist campaign, was
severely wounded by a shot in the face last month. So far 10
suspects related to the case have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
Lari, whose ministry supports the reformist trend in the
country, made the statement amid tension of political struggles in
the country following sensitive parliamentary elections in
February.
</P>
<P>
Reformers supporting Iranian President Mohammed Khatami won an
overwhelming victory in the elections, dealing a severe blow to the
powerful conservatives.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Lari also expressed his concern about the
annulment of certain election results by the Council of Guardians
that supervises the elections. The council's act has stirred up a
series of protests in the country.

CAIRO, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
KHARTOUM -- Sudan's oil output rose 33 percent to hit 200,000
barrels per day (bpd) in the last six months and its total oil
exports were lifted by 20 percent during the period.
</P>
<P>
The local daily al-Ra'i quoted major Nile Firm officials as
saying that many foreign companies have offered to explore crude
oil in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
A refinery at capacity of 450,000 bpd will set into work in
Khartoum as of April 15.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states spent about 35
billion U.S. dollars, or over one third of their total
expenditures, on arms and military equipment purchases in l998,
according to the latest statistics.
</P>
<P>
The Arabic daily al-Alam al-Youm quoted the Unified Arab
Economic Report as saying that from 1992 to 1998, the six GCC
members spent more than 160 billion dollars, about one fourth of
their 650-billion-dollar spending, on military purposes.
</P>
<P>
DUBAI -- Iran on Monday reiterated that it will not give up its
oil quota though it did not participate in the recent agreement on
output increase by members of the Organization of Petrol Exporting
Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
Al-Alam al-Youm quoted Iran's envoy to the OPEC Governor
Council, Hussein Kasimbur Ardabili, as saying that Iran will not
increase its supplies in the market.
</P>
<P>
Last month, nine OPEC states decided to raise daily output by 1.
45 million barrels to quench the surging price. Iran, which pressed
for a minimum increase, did not take part in the decision.
</P>
<P>
Under the recent deal, Iran should move up its daily output to
3.623 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt exported 50 million dollars worth of cast-iron
pipes and valves to the United Arab Emirates' water and sewerage
projects.
</P>
<P>
Nasir Casting Company Chairman Usama Abd el-Wahab said his firm
received another 40-million-dollar offer to export similar amounts
of made-in-Egypt pipes to be used in several other UAE areas.
</P>
<P>
Egypt exported 15 million dollars worth of pipes to Syria, he
said, adding that the company will bid into a 19-million-dollar
international tender to export such type of pipes to Oman.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia also offered to import the Egyptian-made pipes, he
said, pointing that the offer is under examination at present.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Peres Urges Peace Talks With Syria Under U.N. Resolutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli-Syrian peace talks
should be conducted in line with with the relevant United Nations
resolutions, and only in this way can the two sides settle the
issue of the Golan Heights, said a senior Israeli official Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Regional Cooperation Minister Shimon Peres made the remarks to
Israel Radio, just before Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and U.
S. President Bill Clinton are scheduled to hold their summit
meeting at the White House in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Resolutions 242 and 338 call on, among other things,
the negotiating parties in the Middle East to settle their
territorial disputes under the principle of "land for peace."
</P>
<P>
Peres expressed his welcome to the Washington summit between
Barak and Clinton, but said it will be difficult for the two
leaders to decide on the resumption of the Israeli-Syrian talks as
the Syrian side has not changed its positions.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian peace talks were stalled in January after the
two sides held two rounds of talks in the United States since its
resumption last December, as Israel refused to return to Syria the
entire Golan Heights which Israel occupied during the 1967 Middle
East War.
</P>
<P>
To rescue the peace talks will be one of the topics that Barak
and Clinton will discuss during their summit.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian peace talks are to resolve four main issues,
namely the border, security arrangement, water and normalization of
ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During the last two rounds of talks, the Israeli side wanted to
discuss and settle the security arrangement and normalization of
ties first, while the Syrians put the border issue on the top of
the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Syria also said that Israel must withdraw from the Golan Heights
to the June 4, 1967 lines, otherwise, there will be no need for the
two sides to continue the talks.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Angola Plays Down Dispute with Portugal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Bian Zhuodan
</P>
<P>
LUANDA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Angolan officials are making
effort to play down the dispute with its former colonial power
Portugal over the entry visas, with an Angolan official describing
it as "storm in a tea cup".
</P>
<P>
After Portugal's strong reaction to the Angolan rejection of
the entry of 27 Portuguese citizens to the southwest African
country, the Angolan Interior Ministry made a clarification on the
incidents which took place respectively last Friday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to a communique issued by the Interior Ministry,
those Portuguese citizens, who arrived in Angola by the flights of
Air Portugal, were impeded from entering Angola mainly due to the
lack of working permits for those Portuguese who wanted to enter
Angola with tourist visas and then work in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an Angolan diplomat said in an international meeting
of the Portuguese-speaking countries that the relations between
Angola and Portugal are "excellent".
</P>
<P>
Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres said on Monday that
he would respond firmly to any unjustified alteration of the
Angolan policy on the Portuguese visitors, local informed sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Guterres promised to "act with total firmness" if Luanda's
attitude is found "not to correspond to the good state of
relations between Angola and Portugal".
</P>
<P>
Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama, acting on instructions
from Guterres, said on Monday that he had asked Portuguese
embassy in Luanda " to insist on clarification" of the incidents,
which he described as " unprecedented" and "disagreeable".
</P>
<P>
Angolan officials stressed the legality of the airport
procedures, while emphasizing that the government may take steps
to avoid repeated situations.
</P>
<P>
 Local analysts noted that the incidents came after the recent
 bilateral tensions triggered by the former Portuguese President
Mario Soares, who publicly denounced "corruption" and
"dictatorial" practices in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Some Angolan officials accused Soares, now a socialist member
of the European Parliament, of benefiting from illegal diamond
trade by the Angolan rebels led by Jonas Savimbi.

<HEADLINE> Husband of Cult Victim Denounces "Falun Gong" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"My wife, Zhang Yuqing, died from the practice of 'Falun Gong',
" Lu told the 56th session of the United Nations Commission on
Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
"As far as I know, more than 1,000 people in China have died
from committing suicide or refusing medical treatment due to
'Falun Gong'. There are even more people who have become
distraught due to their infatuation with the evil cult," Lu added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier the United States called for international support for
a motion condemning China's human rights record at the session,
with China's stance on "Falun Gong" as an excuse. The Chinese
delegation to the session strongly rejected U.S.' motion, saying
the evil cult had spread fallacies and endangered the life and
health of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
"What I cannot understand is why representatives from certain
NGOs made incitement with distorted stories and shameless slander
in the name of protecting human rights", Lu Xingchong said.
</P>
<P>
"What I cannot understand even more is that the government of
the United States not only shelters Li Hongzhi, head of the evil
cult 'Falun Gong', but even uses such an evil cult as an excuse to
attack my country. This has caused indignation among the 1.2
billion Chinese people including me," he added.
</P>
<P>
In October 1995, Lu recalled, his wife, for the sake of
regaining her health, began to practice "Falun Gong" upon others'
advice. At the beginning, she still went to see her doctor
regularly because she had a cervical problem. Later, those who
taught her "Falun Gong" warned her not to see the doctor once she
began practicing.
</P>
<P>
"They told her that Master Li Hongzhi would help her regain her
health," Lu said. "If she felt pain sometimes, they explained,
that meant she was 'expelling karma' and 'paying debts', which was
an inevitable process. If she consulted doctors or took medicines,
her karma would not be expelled and she would not reach a higher
level and ascend to the heavenly kingdom."
</P>
<P>
Following their advice, his wife had often locked herself in
her room, refusing to let her children and husband in after
September 1997, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
"She became indifferent to daily life and cold to people. She
was deprived of kinship, love and friendship," Lu said. "She
blindly believed in the doomsday theory by Li Hongzhi and was
convinced that the planet would be totally destroyed at eight
o'clock on Mid-Autumn Day of September 1998."
</P>
<P>
Lu said that he had tried many times to persuade his wife to
stop the practice but she was so infatuated that she refused to
take any medicine or receive any treatment in spite of terrible
pain. Finally she was physically and mentally exhausted.
</P>
<P>
"On January 23, 1998, my wife committed suicide by cutting her
throat in the bath room while I was out," Lu said. "Now my
children are deprived of their dear mother and I am deprived of my
beloved wife. My family is torn to pieces. The past days of joy
and happiness are gone forever."

<HEADLINE> British Historian Loses Holocaust Libel Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- British historian David Irving,
who denies that Hitler masterminded mass slaughters and calls the
Auschwitz death camp a Disneyland built after war, Tuesday lost
his High Court libel action against a U.S. professor and her
publishers.
</P>
<P>
Irving, 62, had sued Penguin Books, a subsidiary of media giant
Pearson Plc, and professor Deborah Lipstadt of Emory University in
Atlanta, Georgia, over a book written in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The book said Irving was a partisan of Adolf Hitler, a
holocaust denier and a falsifier of history.
</P>
<P>
Irving said the book destroyed his livelihood and generated
waves of hatred against him.
</P>
<P>
The court judged that what the book says are substantially true
and Irving did have for his own ideological reasons persistently
and deliberately misrepresented and manipulated historical
evidence.
</P>
<P>
Irving has been banned from going to Germany after a 1992
conviction for denying the Holocaust and has also been refused
entry to Canada, Italy, Austria and Australia.
</P>
<P>
He said he will not appeal against the verdict.

<HEADLINE> Scholar Stresses Ecological Protection in West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A leading Chinese scholar has
urged greater attention to ecological protection while developing
the vast western region, which is suffering from a deteriorating
environment.
</P>
<P>
The forest area of most of western China is sparse, with the
coverage rate for the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region only 0.79
percent, and 0.35 percent for Qinghai Province, 1.54 percent for
Ningxia, 4.33 percent for Gansu and 5.84 percent for the Tibet
Autonomous Region, said Jiang Zehui, president of the Chinese
Academy of Forestry.
</P>
<P>
Declining vegetation, soil erosion, and ever-worsening
desertification have seriously hindered economic construction and
social development in the western region, Jiang said in an article
in the Science Times.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State
Council are very concerned about the ecological environment of the
west, and have given priority to the region's ecological
protection and improvement.
</P>
<P>
To halt the sharp decline of forests areas in the region, the
State Forestry Administration plans to launch two strategic
afforestation projects in the west, one to protect natural forests
at the upper reaches of the Yangtze and Yellow rivers, the two
longest rivers in China, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Logging is forbidden in these areas, and some farmland
gradually will be reconverted to forest and grassland.
</P>
<P>
The other project, focusing on the desert areas in northwest,
north and northeast China, aims to control the expansion of
desertification and rehabilitate the ecological system there.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zehui emphasized that awareness of this situation among
residents in the west should also be strengthened to improve their
knowledge of ecological protection.

<HEADLINE> Scientist Calls for Nature Reserve for Rare Yangtze River Fish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese scientist recently
called for the creation of a nature reserve along the Chishui
River, a tributary on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, for
rare and endangered fish.
</P>
<P>
During an academic meeting on sustainable development in
western China, Cao Wenxuan, a member of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences (CAS), said the Chishui River is a perfect habitat for
the rare fish of the Yangtze River, and it is not suitable to
build a hydraulic power plant on the river.
</P>
<P>
In order to protect the 103 varieties of rare fish living in
the Yangtze River, the Wuhan Institute of Hydrobiology under the
CAS launched a research project to choose the best place to build
this reserve.
</P>
<P>
The nature reserve will become a home where the fish can
propagate after the completion of the Three Gorges Dam project,
said Cao.
</P>
<P>
A group of zoologists investigated more than 40 tributaries on
the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and based on the
investigation they concluded that the Chishui River is the ideal
spot for the nature reserve.
</P>
<P>
There are no water projects and no serious pollution along the
Chishui River, which is 436.5 kilometers long and has a basin area
of 21,010 square kilometers, Cao said.
</P>
<P>
However, local governments are planning to build hydraulic
power plants on the river. Cao urged prudent thought before
construction.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Presses for Building Modern Corporate System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji today urged
leaders of state-owned enterprises to fully recognize the new
situation in deepening reform and expanding opening-up, improve
their own quality, and be active in learning and utilizing
advanced methods and successful experiences in managing modern
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The premier, who is also a member of the Standing Committee of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee Political
Bureau, called on state-owned firms to follow the CPC Central
Committee's demands on building the modern corporate system.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remarks here today at a panel discussion with
participants in a training course for leaders of key state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He said that the rise and decline of enterprises depends on the
quality of their managers, and state-owned enterprises will
survive, develop, and expand in fierce market competition by
fostering excellent entrepreneurs who are qualified ideologically
and politically, good at management, canny and able, and bold and
pioneer-minded.
</P>
<P>
Substantial and effective measures must be taken to improve the
overall quality of managers of state-owned enterprises, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Zhu urged these enterprise leaders to learn about finance,
science and technology, law, the international market, and the
management of transnational companies. Supervision of state-owned
firms should be strengthened and lawbreakers punished, he pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
He also urged state-owned companies to widely use modern
management technology, methods and means, to learn advanced
management experiences from home and abroad, and introduce foreign
experts so as to enhance managerial capabilities and lift
competitiveness to a higher level.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier on Management of State-Owned Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo said here
today that strengthening and improving management is a major part
of creating a modern corporate system and also a way for state-
owned companies to reduce losses and increase profits.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier made the remarks at a national work conference
on the reform and management of enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Wu urged recognition of the new situation of
reform and development of state-owned enterprises, renovation of
the managerial system in line with the requirements for building a
modern corporate system, strengthening internal management, and
stepping up ideological work in these companies in order to deal
correctly with the relationship between reform, development, and
stability.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, state-owned and state-controlled firms generated 96.7
billion yuan in profits, a record high in years. In the first two
months of this year these companies made 15.57 billion yuan in
profits, 8.7 times of figure for the same period last year,
according to the vice-premier.
</P>
<P>
However, Wu said, some of these enterprises have experienced
greater difficulties and their workers are suffering from lowered
living standards. Meanwhile, some debt-ridden state-owned firms
did not withdraw from the market in a timely fashion due to the
lack of a perfected social security system, and difficulties in
finding new employment for those who had been laid-off, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wu attributed last year's good results of the state companies
to their own efforts and favorable government policies. This year,
there is little room for the government to help increase profits
for these firms by the use of favorable policies.
</P>
<P>
It will be a difficult job for the state sector to reach the
goal set by the three-year government program to see the entire
sector out of difficulty, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He criticized some state company leaders for failing to change
their old concepts and delaying management reforms. Good policies
cannot produce good results, if management fails, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Mixed Reaction in Turkey to Greek Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- As the Pan-Hellenic Socialist
Movement (PASOK) led by Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis
retained power by a narrow majority in last weekend's general
election, Turkey reacted mixedly as to the prospect of bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Uncertainties are ostensible in Turkey over whether Simitis' new
government will give green light to bilateral military dialog or
attempt to gain time by relying on the European Union policies
concerning the resolution to Aegean and Cyprus disputes.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece have been long in disputes over Aegean Sea
territories and Cyprus issue. Cyprus has been divided since Turkey
invaded and occupied the northern third of the island country in
1974 in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries broke the ice last year when
they rushed to aid their earthquaking neighbor and the
rapprochement trended was reinforced by ensuing high-level exchange
of visits.
</P>
<P>
The uncertainties stemmed from last year's EU Helsinki summit,
which accepted Turkey as a candidate for a full membership but
requested Ankara to settle its disputes with the EU member Greece
before 2004.
</P>
<P>
An unofficial deadline as it is, it means the ball was thrown in
Turkey's court over the Aegean Sea and Cyprus issues, which thus
invited the prediction that Athens would play the EU card against
Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The two countries embrace different perceptions of the 2004
deadline set by the EU. Ankara got a letter of assurance from
Finland, which was then holding the EU rotating presidency, that
solving bilateral disputes was not a precondition for Turkey's EU
membership.
</P>
<P>
But for Greece, the year 2004 might be viewed as the deadline
for Turkey to resolve its disputes with Athens which claimed that
it is now Ankara's responsibility.
</P>
<P>
During his election campaign, Simitis implied that he will seek
a solution on disputes with Turkey through the EU, which fuelled
Turkey's worry that Athens may pursue a policy of shrinking its
efforts in the coming years toward the dispute solution.
</P>
<P>
Turkish diplomatic sources were cautious about politicians'
campaign platforms while waiting for the policies of Greek new
government.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Turkish military and diplomats alike are uncertain
whether Aegean disputes are going to be solved through bilateral
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said that it will become clear in the coming days
or months how far Simitis is willing to further political dialog
with Turkey as nine agreements, signed during exchanges of visits
by the two countries' foreign ministries, will be discussed in the
new Greek cabinet and parliament.
</P>
<P>
Professor Hasan Koni, from Ankara University's Political Science
Department, believed that victory of the now-defeated opposition
New Democracy Party would have had a much better impact on the
resolution of military problems between Turkey and Greece.
</P>
<P>
"In essence, the Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement is more a
nationalist than a leftist party. Whereas New Democracy Party is a
liberal-right party with strong backing from businessmen, it would
be more prepared for solving military issues and highlighting the
commercial aspect of relations," Koni argued.
</P>
<P>
He said that Simitis might seek support from the EU on disputes
with Turkey, rather than establish bilateral military dialog.
</P>
<P>
But some other Turkish experts, however, expressed optimistic
about the prospect of relations with Greece, believing Simitis will
go ahead with his detente policies toward Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Professor Hasan Unal, from Bilkent University in Ankara, said
that there was no reason to expect that Simitis' new cabinet would
change its stance toward Turkey, since rapprochement has been
beneficial for it.

<HEADLINE> India Test Fires New Medium Range Naval Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The missile, named "Dhanush" which means bow in Hindi, was
fired from naval ship INS Subhadra anchored some 20 km from the
coast of the eastern state of Orissa at 1:35 p.m. Tuesday and had
a perfect lift-off, the PTI quoted defense sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 8.56-meter sleek missile, the first of its kind, has been
exclusively developed for the navy and considered as the naval
version of Prithvi, another type of missile India developed
indigenously, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The outcome of the test firing would be fully known after
analyzing the data collected from different tracking and telemetry
centers, they said.
</P>
<P>
According to the PTI, scientists from India's Defense Research
and Development Organization closely monitored the test firing.
</P>
<P>
India has already equipped its army with the 150 km range
Prithvi I surface-to-surface missile, while the 250 km Prithvi II,
being developed for the air force, is also near completion, the
PTI said.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Inch Up on Singapore Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Share prices closed marginally
firmer on Singapore Stock Market Tuesday, posting a broad
downtrend in the morning under pressure of the overnight sharp
fall on the Nasdaq in the United States and staging a late
recovery to shrug off earlier trading losses.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index inched up 4.45 points to end
at 2,131.38 points, moving in the shape of a saddle and bouncing
back from the intraday low of 2,098.16 points in thin trading.
</P>
<P>
The total volume dropped to 165.14 million shares worth 393.37
million Singapore dollars (228.65 million U.S. dollars). There
were 197 losers against 100 gainers with 232 counters unchanged.
</P>
<P>
LafeTech remained at the top of the actives chart with 12.95
million counters changing hands. It was followed by SingTel which
had 9.04 million shares done. JurTech came the third registering a
turnover of 8.77 million units.
</P>
<P>
Gr Eastern and SIA led gainers of the day gaining 50 cents each
to close at 23.50 and 15.50 Singapore dollars, respectively.
Datacrft picked up 35 cents to finish at 8.20 U.S. dollars. SIA
200 ended 30 cents higher at 15.50 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Creative 50 was the biggest loser of the day plunging by 380
cents to close at 47.50 Singapore dollars. DBS sank 70 cents to
finish at 22.00 Singapore dollars. PacCent slid by 50 cents to end
at 14.90 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dealers noted that the market opened broadly lower weighed down
by the sharp overnight plunge on the U.S. Nasdaq but hike in the
afternoon offset earlier losses and rebounded.
</P>
<P>
They said that sentiment for tech stocks was shaky for most of
the day after the Nasdaq's almost-six-percent slump overnight as
investors were continually haunted by doubts over the Nasdaq's
performance and concern over possible U.S. interest hike.
</P>
<P>
However, they noted that SIA bucked the overall downtrend
encouraged by New Zealand government's approval for it to buy up
to 8.3 percent of the share capital of the New Zealand Airline.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Urged to Prepare Framework for Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 11 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN Chamber of Commerce
and Industry President Tajudin Ramli has urged ASEAN to prepare a
new framework on how it could meaningfully take part in the
process of globalization.
</P>
<P>
The sector that urgently requires the framework or guidelines
is the services sector which covers financial services,
telecommunications, multimedia and air services, he said at a
press conference after the second ASEAN Business Summit 2000 was
officially opened here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said a new framework is needed because the ASEAN business
community is not convinced that the existing framework on
globalization can protect their interest.
</P>
<P>
The preparation of the framework is part of capacity building
to meet with the challenges of globalization, Tajudin Ramli said,
adding the other ways to build on ASEAN's capacity to face the
challenges include the physical infrastructure and human resources.
</P>
<P>
The two-day business summit was officiated by Deputy Prime
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi representing Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad who is in Havana to attend the G-77 summit.

<HEADLINE> Former Nigerian Opposition Leader Calls for Sovereign National Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's former opposition leader
Anthony Enahoro Monday said Nigeria was not yet a democratic
country, and called upon a Sovereign National Conference to
address pertinent questions about the country.
</P>
<P>
Enahoro, who arrived in Lagos from a four-year exile in the
United States was welcomed like a hero at the airport of the West
African country' s largest city, according to This Day, a leading
Nigerian newspaper on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We deceive ourselves if we think that we've got to where we
are going," he said, adding that Nigerians need to determine
their relationships with one another, the paper quoted him as
saying during his visit to the residence of Lagos State Governor
Bola Tinubu.
</P>
<P>
He told in Yoruba language to thousands of his supporters, who
are mostly Yorubas, criticizing the current "zoning policy" of
the ruling People's Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
Enahoro was one of the founding fathers of new Nigeria, who
fought tirelessly to press Britain to accept Nigeria's
independence in October, 1960.
</P>
<P>
His chequered political history included a stint as
commissioner (minister) for information, culture, youth, sports,
co-operatives and labor during the period from 1967 to 1974.
</P>
<P>
Enahoro, along with other eminent Nigerians, formed the
Nigeria's National Democratic Coalition to protest the military
annulment of the 1993 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Enahoro was briefly detained in 1994 by the regime of late
military leader Sani Abacha, before he fled the country in 1996.
</P>
<P>
It is not immediately clear if the former opposition leader,
who is now vigorously agitating for a nationalism platform, still
has energy for Nigeria's rigorous politics.

<HEADLINE> First Bulgarian Cargo Ship Sail Through Danube </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A Bulgarian cargo ship with two
barges sailed through the Novi Sad reach on the Danube Monday,
bringing hopes of the re-opening of the river which was blocked
during NATO's air strikes against Yugoslavia last year.
</P>
<P>
Three bridges on the river in Yugoslavia were destroyed by NATO,
stranding until today six Bulgarian cargo ships and 25 barges in
the upper reaches of the river.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian Minister of Transport and Communications Antoni
Slavinski said Monday that the passage of the Bulgarian vessel,
Sredna Gora, was successful only after Yugoslavia took provisional
measures. The cleanup of the river, which is a key trade route
between Eastern and Western Europe, remains a political issue, the
Standard newspaper quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has insisted that any
cleanup operation must be accompanied by rebuilding of the
destroyed bridges while the West strongly opposes the suggestion.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting held in Budapest on Monday, the Danube Commission,
which oversees the river's traffic, put the cleanup cost at 24.1
million euros (24.4 million U.S. dollars), 85 percent of which
will be paid by the European Union and the rest shared by
countries along the river.

<HEADLINE> China NGO Representative Calls for Protection of Women's Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese Non-governmental
Organization (NGO) representative Tuesday called on the United
Nations Commission on Human Rights to do more to promote and
protect women's human rights.
</P>
<P>
"At present, there are too many cases of inadequate protection
and violations of women's human rights across the world," said
Song Wenyan, a representative of the All-China Women's Federation,
at the 56th session of the commission.
</P>
<P>
She told the meeting held specially on women's rights that many
women in China, as a result of practicing "Falun Gong", had killed
themselves or died due to their refusal to seek medical treatment
for their illness.
</P>
<P>
"As a representative from a women's NGO in China, I wish to
inform the House that the harm done by the evil cult has shocked
all Chinese people, including all Chinese women."
</P>
<P>
She hoped that more would be done to empower women, improve
their status and strive for the advancement of women at a time
when some Chinese women have been taken away by the evil cult "
Falun Gong" from participating economic activities, public affairs,
and decision making, which are all strongly advocated and promoted
by the United Nations and the international community including
NGOs.
</P>
<P>
Song also pointed out that a representative from the Freedom
House lied to the meeting on April 7 about the number of "Falun
Gong" practitioners.
</P>
<P>
"She said that according to official statistics, there are 70
million to 100 million "Falun Gong" practitioners in China," Song
said. "I wish to know who is the 'official' she referred to, which
country this 'official' belongs to."
</P>
<P>
"According to my knowledge, the number she gave was a sheer
fabrication by the cult's founder Li Hongzhi, with an intention to
exaggerate the power he had," Song said.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, there are no more than two million 'Falun Gong'
practitioners all over China. What the representative from Freedom
House said here last Friday was all fabricated," Song said.

<HEADLINE> French Crocodile "Bites" Hong Kong Crocodile in Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- La Chemise Lacoste, the France-
based producer of men's shirts, brought a Hong Kong-based garment
company to court here today for violation of a registered trade
mark: a crocodile.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Supreme People's Court held a public hearing of the
case with more than 100 Chinese and foreign spectators.
</P>
<P>
La Chemise Lacoste charged that crocodile design has been
registered as a trade mark in 129 countries around the world since
it was created in 1933.
</P>
<P>
But the French crocodile discovered a twin crocodile in 1995.
Without permission from La Chemise Lacoste, Hong Kong-based
Crocodile Garments Limited and its agent in Beijing also used the
crocodile trade mark on similar products.
</P>
<P>
The French crocodile therefore appealed to stop this violation,
and claimed compensation of 3.5 million yuan (about 421,600 U.S.
dollars). It also required an open apology from the Hong Kong
crocodile.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong crocodile proclaimed that as a well-known company
in Asia, it has used the design of the crocodile for decades. In
China's mainland alone, the Hong Kong crocodile has more than 260
outlets, they claimed.
</P>
<P>
Since the French crocodile and the Hong Kong crocodile appeal
to different groups of customers, the public is not confused by
the crocodile trade mark, said the Hong Kong company.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong crocodile emphasized that its clothing
accessories are only available in special outlets, and this
prevents customer confusion.
</P>
<P>
It has been noticed that in the eyes of ordinary customers, the
biggest difference is that the French crocodile faces right, and
the Hong Kong crocodile faces left. The label also differs, since
La Chemise Lacoste uses "Lacoste" while the Crocodile Garment Ltd.
uses "Crocodile."
</P>
<P>
After a show of evidence and debate, the judge announced that
the verdict would be announced later.

<HEADLINE> China Boosts Offshore Oil and Gas Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- China expects an annual average
increase of 20 percent in offshore oil and gas production from
2000 to 2005, as it launches a massive development of its new oil
and gas fields.
</P>
<P>
The country expects to enhance its offshore oil and gas outputs
equivalent to 40 million tons by 2005, according to Wei Liucheng,
president of the China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC).
</P>
<P>
China has discovered a group of large-sized oil and gas bearing
structures in the Bohai Sea, South China Sea and East China Sea
which are all rich in oil and gas reserves, said the official.
</P>
<P>
The Penglai 19-3 structure in the bay areas of Bohai Sea is
particularly large with proven crude reserves hitting 300 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
The oilfield is expected to be developed in the latter half of
this year and be put into operation by 2004 with an annual
production capacity of 15 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The Xihu Depression in the basin of the East China Sea is
particularly rich in gas resources with proven and probable gas
reserves topping 150 billion cubic meters. Experts expect the
total gas resources in the Xihu Depression to hit one to two
trillion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
In addition to gas, the Xihu Depression is also rich in oil
resources with total resources reaching 1.2 billion tons.
</P>
<P>
Wei noted that CNOOC has set 2000 as its "Gas Development Year",
and is giving priority to developing offshore gas in the East
China Sea. So far, drilling operation has started in the Shaoxing
6-1 structure in the Xihu Depression.
</P>
<P>
Large-sized offshore oil and gas projects which have been
launched or to be launched include the second-phase project of
Suizhong 36-1, Qinhuangdao 32-6, Wenchang 13-1/2, Panyu 5-1,
Caofeidian 11-1, Bozhong 29-4 and Bozhong 25-1 in the Bohai Sea

BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- China Huarong Asset Management
Corporation (AMC) today officially opened regional offices in
Zhengzhou, Chengdu, and Changchun, marking the launching of
business nationwide by the country's largest AMC.
</P>
<P>
Founded in October last year, the Huarong AMC is a wholly state-

</P>
<P>
He said the corporation has already made significant progress
in the purchasing of non-performing assets and the debt-to-equity
swapping. When the 30 offices are in full operation, the
corporation will handle non-performing loans and collateral, and
provide comprehensive management consultation services for
acquisitions and mergers, asset and debt reorganization, and the
listings on stock markets.

He said that to date the corporation has signed debt-to-equity
swap agreements with more than 40 state-owned enterprises
involving a total value of over 30 billion yuan.

efforts of the Japan Association for the Promotion of
International Trade for its role in bilateral relations between

<HEADLINE> China Provides Humanitarian Aid to DPRK Nationals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua)-- China has provided humanitarian
aid to nationals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (
DPRK) who illegally crossed the border into Chinese territory in
recent years, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi.
</P>
<P>
Sun made the remark at a regular press conference here today,
in response to a question about this situation.
</P>
<P>
He said the since the DPRK met with some temporary economic
difficulties, a small number of DPRK citizens illegally crossed
the border into China because of economic hardships in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
China, as a close neighbor of the DPRK, has provided
humanitarian support to those DPRK nationals in line with the
traditional friendship between the two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
But according to international law and their purpose for
crossing the border into China, Sun said, they are not refugees.

<HEADLINE> China Independently Develops Satellite Perigee Solid Kick Motor: FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Sun Yuxi today reaffirmed that China has developed the
satellite perigee kick motor, known as EPKM, entirely relying on
its own efforts.
</P>
<P>
At a regular press conference in response to a relevant
question, he said that China has noticed media reports saying that
Lockheed Martin of the United States was involved in the
development of the motor.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that a spokesman of China Great Wall Industry
Corporation had made the issue clear the other day.
</P>
<P>
The so-called allegation that China had probably acquired
technical assistance from Lockheed Martin in the development of
the EPKM is groundless, said Sun.
</P>
<P>
"We have also noticed that Lockheed Martin has denied these
charges", Sun noted.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Asia Satellite Telecommunications Co. Ltd. is
not the holding company of the China International Trust and
Investment Corp. (CITIC), and CITIC, as a shareholder of the Asia
Satellite Telecommunications Co. Ltd., has not been engaged
directly in the business activities of the satellite
Telecommunications company.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that the normal exchanges between China and the U.S.
in economic, trade, scientific and technological fields conform to
the common interests of the people of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
What the U.S. government should do is to safeguard the normal
exchanges between the two countries in the economic, trade, and
scientific and technological fields, instead of setting up
obstacles to intervene the normal development of bilateral
exchanges, he said.
</P>
<P>
Any attempt to stick to a Cold War mentality and destroy Sino-U.
S. relations is doomed to failure, Sun said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The People's Liberation Army (PLA)
is speeding up the training of its middle-ranking armament command
officers, in a move to improve their policy-making, coordination
and research capacities.
</P>
<P>
An official with the General Armament Department of the PLA
said the move is taken to meet the requirement of the PLA's
purchase, management and maintenance of armaments.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that the PLA launch large-scale training

<HEADLINE> Xinhua Commentary Criticizes Formalism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- China's official news agency
Xinhua released a special commentary today exposing the harm of
formalism and calling for resolute efforts to get rid of the
bureaucratic style.
</P>
<P>
For a long time, some localities have favored formalism, that
is, cooking official accounts and exaggerating their working
performances, and this has had a very bad influence on society,
the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
Despite the various forms it may take, formalism actually stems
from a deviation from Party policies, and from the individualism
that exists among some leading officials.
</P>
<P>
These officials often hope that through boasting and
exaggerating their performances they will impress their superiors
and thereby gain promotions to higher positions.
</P>
<P>
"Formalism has gravely undermined the relationship between the
Party and the people, and between the government and the masses,
sullying the image of the Party and the government," the
commentary notes.
</P>
<P>
To combat formalism, it is first of all imperative to
straighten out the line of thinking of officials, according to the
commentary.
</P>
<P>
Seeking truth from facts has been the line of thinking of the
Party, and it is by sticking to this line that the Party has
overcome many difficulties in leading the nation forward.
Formalism is just the opposite.
</P>
<P>
In the process, leading officials should take a lead, and
democracy should be given full play, the commentary stresses.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Book Labels on Display </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Ancient book labels, including
two in German books published in 1575, are now being displayed at
the National Library of China in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Originating in Germany in the 15th Century, book labels are
considered a kind of miniature art. They are put inside book
covers using block-print technique to print the owners' names,
titles, or maxims.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is the first in China showing classic Western
book labels in rare editions of books in Western languages
collected by the library.
</P>
<P>
The two German labels were the earliest collections by Chinese,
only 10 years later than the world's earliest, collected by
Britain.
</P>
<P>
Two labels in Chinese on Western books published in 1735 and
1902 are also part of the exhibit.
</P>
<P>
Book labels spread to China in the early 20th Century, and the
first were used in two albums published in 1909.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition also shows that the National Library of China
was the first library in the country to use these labels. In the
1930s, the library started releasing two kinds: block-prints in
Western books the library bought, and those in Chinese characters.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition started this past weekend and will run until
early June.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Export Growth Likely to Slow Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's exports this year
are expected to enjoy continued growth but at a slower pace,
International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This was due to the economic slow down of the country's biggest
market, the United States, which maintained a share of 21.9
percent of Malaysia's exports with 70.4 billion ringgit (18.526
billion U.S. dollars) in 1999, the minister said at her ministry's
annual trade and industry dialogue with Electrical and electronic
(E&AMP;E) associations and wood-based industry associations here.
</P>
<P>
"The growth in exports was mainly due to strong demand from
industrialized countries and economic recovery in the Asian region,
" she was quoted by Bernama News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the first two months of 2000, exports reached 52.5 billion
ringgit (13.815 billion dollars) with E&AMP;E products remaining the
largest export earner with 29.8 billion ringgit (7.842 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Rafidah said that to develop and enhance export capabilities of
local companies, the government has launched two programs, namely,
industrial linkage program and global supplier program aimed at
fostering linkages and integration between SMI and large
corporations both locally and overseas as their suppliers.
</P>
<P>
She said in developing and strengthening the export markets,
the government has planned some 203 trade promotion programs in
the established and less established markets throughout this year.
</P>
<P>
The government is also assisting local companies to identify
and explore new markets through the Malaysian External Trade
Development Corporation (Matrade) which provides various market
information and online communications facilities through its
homepage, she said.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged companies to create their own websites to
promote their products and link up with Matrade in export
promotion and establish business networks.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka police has seized 1.72
kg of smuggled heroin following the arrest of a woman at the
Colombo International Airport, Police said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan woman is said to be a nurse by profession who is
domiciled in Pakistan. The heroin was detected under several under-
wears worn by the woman, Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) officials
said.
</P>
<P>
She had arrived in Sri Lanka Monday by SU 543 flight from
Pakistan.She had travelled to Sri Lanka almost every two months.
</P>
<P>
The PNB seized 38.4 kilograms of smuggled heroin in March this
year at the airport, the largest ever haul in the country recent
years.
</P>
<P>
Interpol has identified Sri Lanka as a major transit point in
international drug smuggling due to its strategic location between
two main drug producing areas -- the Golden Triangle of Myanmar,
Thailand and Laos and the Golden Crescent comprising Pakistan,
Afghanistan and Iran.
</P>
<P>
Most of the drugs that enter Sri Lanka were smuggled out
through commercial flights or container cargo from the port,
police said.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's law enforcement officers caught 68.5 kilograms of
heroin in 1999, a 40 percent rise over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
However, detection of drugs had risen sharply in 2000. In the
first three months the PNB had recovered 55 kg of heroin.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Police Give Reward on Clue for Arrest of Cult Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan police have announced a
reward of 12 million shillings (8,000 U.S. dollars) to those who
will provide information for the arrest of the six main leaders of
the cult Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of
God, the Monitor newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Police Spokesman Asuman Mugenyi as saying
that they had put up a reward of two million shillings (1,333 U.S.
dollars) to anybody who gives a clue leading to the arrest of
each of the six cult leaders including Joseph Kibwetere, founder
of the cult organization.
</P>
<P>
Over 530 cult members and their children were burnt to death in
a nailed shut church building in Kanungu in southwestern Uganda on
March 17. About 500 bodies of cult members have since been
exhumed in mass graves around the area.
</P>
<P>
Mugenyi said the police needed body bags, protective wear,
disinfectants and land for reburying the exhumed bodies of those
murdered by the cult leaders.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the Kanungu incident, Ugandan police required the
International Criminal Police Organization to help arrest the cult
leaders who are said to be still on the run.

<P>
NANSHA, Guangdong Province, April 11 (Xinhua) -- China's top
golfer Zhang Lianwei rolled to win the Ericsson China PGA
Challenge with a 5-under-par 129 at the Nansha Golf Club on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Coming into the second day with 4-under 68, Zhang maintained
his form to extend a 2-stroke lead to four more to win his first
competition this year.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Wengen took the second place with 1-under while Qi Zengfa,
from the city of Shenzhen with Zhang, was at third with four
further back at 137.
</P>
<P>
But Zhang needed some luck to hold his lead at the hole 14.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Jun, winner of the 1997 World China Tour in Beijing,
closed up the gap to one stroke trailing to Zhang at hole 10, but
hit a double bogey at 14 to fall back again.
</P>
<P>
"I really felt great pressure at 10 when I hit a bad putt,"
said Zhang, who won the second place in the 1998 Bangkok Asian
Games. "But Cheng also made mistake at 14 to give me a breath."
</P>
<P>
Cheng, who is in the same Shenzhen Golf Club as Zhang, said, "I
didn't think much then, but just wanted to save my par. But maybe
I should be more careful to have a par or even a bogey."
</P>
<P>
Lin Shaoru won the women's game with 1-under-par 133 when she
struck a 2-under 70 on Tuesday.
</P>

Yang Hongmei was second with four more strokes, followed by

<HEADLINE> China's 1999 Imports from Africa up: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- China took measures to encourage
imports from Africa in 1999 to offset its trade surplus, said a
senior Chinese trade official here today.
</P>
<P>
While addressing the opening ceremony of a seminar for Chinese
and African economic officials, He Xiaowei, Chinese Assistant
Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, said that
China's imports from Africa in 1999 reached 2.37 billion U.S.
dollars, up 60.9 percent from that in 1998 thanks to efforts made
by the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 trade between China and Africa totaled 8.48 billion U.
S. dollars, 17.2 percent more than in 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
China invested a total of 130 million U.S. dollars in Africa
last year, and set up 64 enterprises in the continent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese enterprises have also gained access to the African
construction market with their good quality and low prices,
according to He.

<HEADLINE> China Demands Thorough Investigation of U.S. Bombing of Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Government strongly
demands that the U.S. Government conduct a comprehensive and
thorough investigation into its bombing of the Chinese Embassy in
Yugoslavia last May, bring the perpetrators to justice, give the
Chinese Government and people a satisfactory explanation, and
remove the negative impact of the issue on Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi made the remarks at
a regular press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
"Only in this way could Sino-U.S. relations maintain a healthy
and sustained development," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. bombing of the Chinese Embassy in the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia caused a heavy casualty and severe damages to the
embassy premises, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
In committing this act, the U.S. side seriously violated the
relevant international conventions and basic norms governing
international relations, infringed gravely on China's sovereignty,
greatly hurt the dignity of the Chinese people and severely
damaged Sino-U.S. relations, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
Sun, who had been to Yugoslavia after the bombing, said that
the Federal Directory of Supply and Procurement is not a secret
agency and its building is half a kilometer away from the Chinese
Embassy. "The two buildings look totally different, so it was
impossible for the U.S. side to mix up these two buildings," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia has
unmistakable symbols and it is also clearly marked on the U.S.
maps. The U.S. claim that it did not know its exact location is
not justified, he said.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Bezeq company's monopoly on Israel's telephone and
Internet infrastructure will be broken in a few months, as soon as
the government and the Knesset (parliament) approve an amendment in
the Bezeq Law to allow cable-TV companies to compete in these
markets.
</P>
<P>
Communications Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer will bring his
proposal for the amendment to the government by Independence Day in
May.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Residents of the Israeli-occupied "security zone" in south
Lebanon have in recent weeks formed "civil guard" units to carry
out for operation prior to Israeli troops pullout this July.
</P>
<P>
These units are designed to act alongside the pro-Israeli South
Lebanon Army (SLA) and might replace the SLA after the Israeli
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
At first, according to Israeli security officials, civil guard
members will be armed with firearms owned privately by local
residents. However, the militia could in the future be furnished by
SLA weapons.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak will tell United States
President Bill Clinton at their White House summit Tuesday that he
is intending to make progress in talks with the Palestinians but "
you need two to tango."
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations said Barak
will present a framework agreement plan and Israel's own redlines
to Clinton during the meeting, agreeing to a Palestinian
independent state on 60 percent of the West Bank and Gaza Strip
land.
</P>
<P>
Israel is trying to reach a framework agreement with
Palestinians in the coming months. The target date for concluding
the document was currently set for May 13 after its original date
of February 13 passed.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Barak came away after his talks with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo Monday as pessimistic
about success on the Syrian peace track as he had felt before the
meeting, a source aboard Barak's plane to Washington said Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
The official confirmed recent reports that Syrian had hardened
its stance and said the meeting Tuesday in Washington with Clinton
would therefore focus primarily on the Palestinian peace track.
</P>
<P>
Regarding Syria's demand to have access to Lake Kinneret (Sea of
Galilee) as part of any peace deal, the official reiterated the
government's position, saying that Israel has one fresh-water lake
and it is a top national priority to maintain full authority over
that lake.

<HEADLINE> Iran Must Join WTO: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 11 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian official on Tuesday
underlined the urgency of Iran's entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO), calling it an "inevitable necessity."
</P>
<P>
Sooner or later Iran should join the WTO, and any delay in
joining the world organization will create problems for the
country's production units, said Hussein Naji, deputy industries
minister for non-ferrous industries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a gathering of industrialists in Gachsaran, capital
of the western Kohkiluyeh-Boyer Ahmad Province, the official also
called for greater banking facilities for industrial units, the
Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to the liberalization of the country's industry
sector as one of the main features of the third five-year plan
(2000-2005).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the governor-general of the province, Karim
Shurangiz, stressed the importance of the acquisition of expertise
and modern technical know-how in the industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
He said directors and industrialists equipped with the latest
academic and technical knowledge are prerequisites to the progress
of an industry, IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, several Iranian officials urged the government
to consider the WTO membership, but many experts noted that Iran's
industries will face a serious challenge if the country joins the
world trade body.

<HEADLINE> Parties to CITES Urged to Develop Laws on Wildlife Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The International Criminal Police
 Organization (Interpol) has warned that the legal framework and
enforcement structures in fighting wildlife crime in some
countries are non-existent.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, not all parties to the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) have introduced
their own national laws to penalize the illegal trade in
endangered species of wild fauna and flora," secretary-general of
the Interpol Raymond Kendall said in his article published by the
latest issue of the United Nations Environment Program's magazine
Our Planet.
</P>
<P>
In the article titled Interpol Alert, Kendall said that it was
urgent that all parties should develop proper enforcement
structures and appropriate laws that internationally harmonized.
</P>
<P>
It is a relatively new crime area for law enforcement agencies
worldwide, Kendall said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the numbers of some endangered species have
recently diminished significantly and illegal hunting is one
factor behind this dramatic decline in numbers.
</P>
<P>
"Interpol is actively engaged in the fight against wildlife
crime," Kendall added.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting of the Interpol working group on wildlife
crime was held in the Netherlands in 1994 and objectives of
cooperation among different countries were worked out, he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on member countries of CITES to take effective law
enforcement measures against the crime in order to safeguard the
environment and protect the planet.

<P>
LAGOS, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Nigerian newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Post Express:

country on Monday after four years of self-exile in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Daily Times:
</P>

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Study Finds Enormous Demand for IT Workers in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. employers can fill less
than half of the information technology jobs available next year,
indicating that the country is ill-equipped to staff the source of
its economic growth, according to an industry group study released
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Information Technology Association of America (ITAA)
determined in its study that IT work force in the United States
numbers over 10 million and needs 1.6 million more workers in 2000.
Hiring managers foresee a shortfall of almost 850,000
appropriately skilled workers.
</P>
<P>
"The nation's economic future is tied to the availability of
appropriately skilled workers," ITAA President Harris Miller said.
</P>
<P>
Technical support representatives, database developers, and Web
administrators and programmers are the top three most in-demand IT
careers, the study shows.
</P>
<P>
Employers will seek to fill over 600,000 jobs for tech support
personnel alone over the next 12 months. Workers with Web-related
skills are the target of 13 percent of all IT hiring, according to
the study.
</P>
<P>
The study also finds that although traditional training
providers such as colleges and private schools are considered
effective, employers expressed a strong preference for creating
their own formal, on-the-job training programs.
</P>
<P>
Training after the employee is hired is rated by the managers
as significantly more effective than pre-hire methods of training.
Four-year colleges and private technical institutes were rated
highest among pre-hire skill acquisition methods when comparing
all positions.
</P>
<P>
Study results are based on a random sample of 700 IT managers,
both inside and outside the IT industry. ITAA consists of 400
direct and 26,000 affiliate corporate members throughout the U.S.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Pro-Nazi Writer Gets One-Year Jail Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A Swiss writer has been given a
one-year jail term by a Lausanne court for denying the Holocaust
and Nazi war crimes, Radio International reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Gaston-Armand Amaudruz, nearly 80 years old, was found guilty
of racial discrimination following a three-day trial held last
week in Lausanne correctional court.
</P>
<P>
The charges were based on an article in Amaudruz's magazine, Le
Courrier du Continent, and 24 revisionist books.
</P>
<P>
In the magazine article, he denied for lack of proof the
existence of Nazi gas chambers where Jews were systematically
executed.
</P>
<P>
"For my part, I maintain my position: I don't believe in the
gas chambers. Let the exterminationists provide the proof and I
will believe it. But as I've been waiting for this proof for
decades, I don't believe I will see it soon."
</P>
<P>
The revisionist writer also insisted it was "impossible" for
six million Jews to have been murdered by the Nazis during World
War II.
</P>
<P>
Amaudruz was charged under Switzerland's 1995 anti-racism law,
which makes it a criminal offense to "deny, grossly minimize or
seek to justify genocide or other crimes against humanity."
</P>
<P>
It is thought that Amaudruz first came into contact with Nazis
engaged in the German legation in Berne during World War Two when
Switzerland was neutral.

gained a 89 percent increase in operating profit for the club's
parent company.
</P>
<P>
Parent company Leeds Sporting Plc posted an operating profit
before clearing player debts of 6.4 million pounds (10 million U.S.
dollars) in the six months to the end of December, up from 3.4

</P>
<P>
Television revenue jumped 49 percent to 7.0 million pounds
while ticket sales rose 49 percent to 6.1 million and merchanding

sponsorship agreements and the prospect of perhaps participating
in (next season's) Champions League, we have strong grounds to be
optimistic about the future," Leeds Sporting said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Leeds are third in the premier league and are also in the UEFA
Cup semi-final, which has been overshadowed by two of their fans
being stabbed to death in Istanbul before the first leg against
Galatasaray last week.

<HEADLINE> No Casualties In Wholesale Market Fire in Kunming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- No casualties have been reported
following Monday's large fire which destroyed a wholesale market
in Kunming, capital of southwest China's Yunnan Province, Xinhua
has learned.
</P>
<P>
The fire broke out at the Nanyao Cosmopolitan Wholesale Market
at 5:00 p.m. Beijing time Monday, and was extinguished by 00:30 a.
m. this morning.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zigang, deputy chief of the Yunnan Provincial Fire
Department, said the fire destroyed more than 400 business stands
and over 250 adjacent residential houses, involving an area of 10,
000 square meters. It was the most serious fire in the city in
recent years, Wang added.
</P>
<P>
A total of 500 firefighters participated in controlling the
blaze, and by early Tuesday morning ten people had been rescued
from the building. No bodies were found, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Sources at a local hospital said three people were injured in
the fire, and two firefighters suffering from noxious fumes were
said to be in stable condition.
</P>
<P>
The cause of fire and total economic losses are still under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
The Nanyao market had more than 1,500 business stands covering
an area of over 50,000 square meters.
</P>
<P>
The local fire department said that the fire-control equipment
at the market has not gone through the required examinations.

<HEADLINE> Shelterbelt in N.E. China Helps Fight Desertification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A forest shelterbelt network
which has been established in northeast China's Jilin province has
helped decrease land threatened by desertification from 7.3
million hectares in the 1970s to 2.53 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
The province launched four major shelterbelts projects at the
beginning of the 1990s. In the past eight years, the province
planted 120,000 hectare of trees, increasing the province's forest
coverage from 10.3 percent to 12.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Desertification is believed to be one of the major
environmental problems around the globe, threatening the lives of
some 900 million people.
</P>
<P>
In China, about 15.9 percent of the total land area is hit by
desertification, and desertification is growing by 2,000 sq. km a
year.

<HEADLINE> Pre-registered Domain Names Cause Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Domain names are being stolen by
others, although the practice is not illegally.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 percent of the top 100 listed firms in China don't
have domain names in Pinyin, or Romanization of their Chinese
names on the Net. Neither do 75 percent of the most popular 20
brands, according to 3721.com, a website offering domain name
registration service.
</P>
<P>
Such practices occurred in the United States and other
countries as well, whereby big companies have to pay large ransom
to buy back their "names".
</P>
<P>
A couple of years ago, registration of domain names of famous
Chinese firms in English was found rampant overseas, either by
institutions or individuals.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese firms realized the importance of their domain
names, but only registered them under the China domain, ending
with ".cn".
</P>
<P>
Domain names previously registered by others have found to be
rampant in the past six months, especially from February to March
this year. Some of the applicants are Chinese, said Hu Haidi, vice
president of 3721.com.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Internet users are most familiar with the Pinyin of
those big companies, and may be misled to other websites under the
name of the companies.
</P>
<P>
Hu has called for enterprises to protect themselves by applying
for domain names as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> China's Major Air-conditioner Maker Slashes Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Chunlan Group, a major air-
conditioner manufacturer in China, has slashed its prices
drastically, with reduction in some models exceeding 1,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
However, six other major air-conditioner manufacturers
including Gree, Haier, and Changhong announced that they would not
involve themselves in the price war, "China Business Daily"
reported.
</P>
<P>
Chunlan, whose annual air-conditioner output tops two million,
said it did not wish to wage price wars against other
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
China's air-conditioner industry has been growing steadily over
the past years. However, the fast-growing industry has outstripped
demand, glutting the market with oversupply.
</P>
<P>
Some ten million air-conditioners were sold last year in China,
one million surplus goods were left in warehouses.
</P>
<P>
The profit margin of air-conditioners is estimated by some
analysts at ten percent.
</P>
<P>
The availability of air-conditioners in China stands at 20
percent in urban areas, much lower than the 90 percent coverage of
color TV sets. Sales of air-conditioners accounted for only half
of color TV sets last year.

<HEADLINE> Teenager Smoking on Rise in China: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Almost one in every six smokers
in China is a teenager and if the present situation remains
unchanged, three million Chinese could die from smoking annually
by the year 2050, according to the "People's Daily".
</P>
<P>
There are some 50 million young smokers in China, the world's
biggest tobacco producer and consumer. There are some 320 million
smokers in China, or one fourth of smokers worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The average age of taking up smoking is three years younger
compared with 1984. About 38 percent of people over 15 are smokers.
</P>
<P>
Medical studies show that smoking is closely linked with 25
kinds of life-threatening illnesses, such as lung cancer, cardio
and cerebral vascular and heart diseases.
</P>
<P>
Lung cancer has been rising by 4.5 percent annually in China in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
Specialists with the Chinese Academy of Medical Science and the
Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine said that if drastic
changes are not made to curb smoking among teenagers, ten million
people worldwide might be killed every year in the future, three
million of whom are in China.

BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- In 1999, nearly 9,000 varieties
of products from 7,485 enterprises were examined by State Bureau
of Quality and Technical Supervision (SBQTS). Some 21.4 percent of
products were not up to standard.

SBQTS has reexamined 1,238 varieties of unqualified products
from 1,123 enterprises, with 97.8 percent of the products up to

</P>
<P>
SBQTS has trained leaders from unqualified enterprises. Some
local quality and technical supervision departments suggested that
local governments should withdraw licenses from nine enterprises
that failed to meet standard product requirements.
</P>
<P>
Although Chinese-made products have improved in recent years,
serious quality problems have been found in small enterprises with
some products reportedly harming people's health.
</P>
<P>
Local quality and technical supervision departments are urged
to strengthen inspection of shoddy products in the future.

<HEADLINE> China Striving to Keep Birth Rate Low (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- China intends to make every
effort to maintain the low birth rate achieved after 30 years of
family planning policy, according to an article in the 7th issue
of China Comment which is published here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The birth rate and natural growth rate of China's population
have been cut by half and by about two-thirds, respectively, since
1970, but the country is still under pressure from a large growing
population," the periodical, formerly called Fortnightly Review, a
leading bi-weekly periodical on current affairs, quoted Zhang
Weiqing, head of the State Family Planning Commission, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said the average fertility rate among women has been
kept under two since for a decade, which means the Chinese
population is no longer booming, but if there are any mistakes in
population policy, or negative effects brought about by the
international community, the birth rate in China might return to a
high level.
</P>
<P>
According to a decision on population and family planning
issued by China's Central authorities last month, the country
plans to keep its population under 1.4 billion by the end of 2010,
with an average birth rate of 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The quality of the Chinese population will also be greatly
improved during this period, and a comprehensive system of family
planning laws, regulations, and strict management will then be in
place, the decision said.
</P>
<P>
"It is actually a very arduous task," said Zhang, "because
problems such as the increasing transient population and under-
employed people, as well as early marriages and child-bearing
remain obstacles to efficient family planning."

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Host Computer Design Contest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The universities in Beijing plan
to hold a computer design competition in the Chinese capital in
the near future, it was announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Senior students at Qinghua University, Beijing Polytechnic
University, Beijing Science and Technology University, and other
universities and colleges are expected to participate.
</P>
<P>
The contest is designed to help make computers fit the
personalized needs of Chinese computer users, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
Since the birth of personal computers, the IBM machine style
has dominated the market. Now, with the advance of technologies,
it is becoming increasingly possible to achieve breakthroughs in
the design of computer sets themselves.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming contest will provide a good opportunity for the
university students to give full play to their imagination and
talents, the organizers said.

<P>
In some remote areas of western China, local residents still
desire more children than state policy requires, and this has
added heavy burdens to their impoverished lives.
</P>
<P>
By the mid-21st Century, the number of women of child-bearing
age in China will reach 300 million, which is almost on a par with
the figure for the 1990s. The Chinese population will increase by
10 million a year over the next few years, and the number of
people of working age as well as the number of elderly people will
reach their peaks.
</P>
<P>
Zhang pointed out that in the next decade it will be vital for
the country to maintain a low birth rate.
</P>
<P>
However, China is practicing a more flexible family planning
policy in rural areas and in areas where ethnic minorities live in
large numbers, he said.
</P>
<P>
In Yunnan, Qinghai, and three other provinces and autonomous
regions, rural couples are allowed to have two children. In Henan,
Anhui, and 17 other provinces and autonomous regions, rural
couples who have only a daughter are allowed to have a second
child. But in Beijing, Jiangsu Province, and other developed areas,
rural residents have to follow the one-child policy just as urban
residents.
</P>
<P>
In almost all provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities,
a couple is allowed to have two children if they are both only
children.
</P>
<P>
Some areas even provide pension insurance for rural parents in
one-child and two-daughter families. For example, Guangdong
Province provides such insurance for 67 percent of the one-child
and two-daughter families.
</P>
<P>
Zhang concluded that the Chinese population will stop growing
in the middle of the 21st Century. But China will still face the
great challenge of feeding and providing jobs for a population of
1.6 billion.

<HEADLINE> Thailand, U.S., Singapore to Hold Joint Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The armed forces of Thailand,
Singapore and the United States will conduct the 19th Exercise
Cobra Gold in Thailand from May 9 to 23, representatives of the
three countries announced here Tuesday at a joint press conference.
</P>
<P>
Cobra Gold 2000 is a regularly scheduled joint exercise and is
the latest in the continuing series of U.S.-Thai military
exercises designed to ensure regional peace and strengthen the
ability of the Royal Thai armed forces to defend Thailand or
regional contingencies, an army spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
This year, for the first time, at the invitation of Thai armed
forces 29 Singaporean soldiers will participate in the exercise,
which is one of the largest exercises involving U.S. forces in the
Pacific Command this year.
</P>
<P>
"We think it is a good opportunity for us to learn from Thai
and U.S. armed forces," Colonel Jerry Soh, defense attache of the
Singaporean embassy to Thailand told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The 29 Singaporean military staff will be assigned to different
parts of the exercise, allowing them to have a comprehensive
understanding of the exercise, Soh said.
</P>
<P>
But he refused to say whether the Singaporean forces will be
more involved in this exercise in the future.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia and the Philippines were invited to be observers of
the exercise.
</P>
<P>
The exercise will focus on peace enforcement operations,
including planning and execution of a noncombatant evacuation
operation.
</P>
<P>
This type of military operations is increasingly called for in
today's world and are more likely than a major theater war, said a
press release of the U.S. embassy here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Lance Booth, chief of Joint U.S. Military Advisory
Group Thailand (JUSMAGTHAI), told Xinhua that the goal of the
exercise is to help Thailand to be prepared in case of crisis. He
attributed the good performance of Thai armed forces in
peacekeeping mission last year in East Timor to the exercise.
</P>
<P>
He denied that the U.S. wants to involve all ASEAN countries in
exercise.
</P>
<P>
As in all previous Cobra Gold exercises, this year's exercise
will include joint-combined land and air operations, combined
naval operations, amphibious operations and special operations.
</P>
<P>
A total of 13,196 U.S. forces will participate, including
elements of U.S. army, Pacific; U.S. Marine Corps Forces, Pacific;
as well as Special Operations Command Pacific , Air Combat Command,
Air Mobility Command, and reserve elements from the army, navy,
air force and marine corps.
</P>
<P>
Participating Thai forces will amount to 7,100, from army, navy,
marine corps and air force.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 112 aircraft and 13 naval vessels will be deployed.
Among the aircraft to be used are C-130 cargo plane, F-18 fighting
jet, AV-8 marine airplane, EA-6 anti-missile airplane and various
kinds of helicopters, Major Dave Teel, JUSMAGTHAI air operations
officer told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
U.S. aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk will also be deployed in the
exercise, he said.

<P>
NAIROBI, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Chief of General Staff
Daudi Tonje has said that the country's defence force will be
reduced to a small well- equipped and well-trained troop.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation newspaper on Tuesday quoted Tonje as saying
such a force can effectively defend the country from any external
aggression.
</P>
<P>
Tonje told reporters at the weekend during the annual march and
shoot exercise in Oldonyo Marushi area of Kajiado District in
southern Kenya that "there is no need for us to have a large armed
force which is not well- equipped and not well-trained."
</P>
<P>
"The dimension of attack from the enemy has now changed. We
need a small well-equipped and well-trained personnel for swift
action and movement," Tonje said.
</P>
<P>
However, the general did not disclose Kenya's defence strength
or the number to be reduced.
</P>
<P>
So far, Kenya's defence is divided in three arms, namely the

<P>
NAIROBI, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is to spend
401 million shillings (around 5.5 million U.S. dollars) to upgrade
its Longonot International satellite earth station, about 50
kilometers northwest of the capital Nairobi, the East African
Standard newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The upgrading project is seen as critical for Telkom Kenya, the
state- owned telecommunications corporation, in its efforts to
boost traffic capacity in liberalizing telecommunications sector
and also a major step to improve the country's infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Vertex RSI, an American company, and its local partner are
currently installing a new digital transmission to replace the
old analog technology at the station.
</P>
<P>
The project will also provide training opportunities to
Telkom's technical staff through follow-on operations and
maintenance support, said John Geiling, vice-president of Vertex
RSI.
</P>
<P>
Upon the completion of the project by the end of this year,
there will be a significant increase of access to international

<HEADLINE> American Swimming Team Head Criticizes Bodysuits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The head of the United States
swimming team on Tuesday criticized the use of full-length
bodysuits, saying they would be an unfair advantage to those top
swimmers who had access to them.
</P>
<P>
In an interview on Australian radio, Dennis Pursley said his
biggest concern was that only a select few would have access to
the custom-made suits, giving them a distinct advantage.
</P>
<P>
"I do not know that all the swimmers that are Olympic hopefuls
will have those opportunities," Pursley noted.
</P>
<P>
Pursley added that he believed the neck-to-ankle suits breached
the spirit of the rules of swimming even though the sport's world
governing body FINA has cleared them.
</P>
<P>
He said: "FINA has a rule that says you cannot wear any suits
or equipment that are performance enhancing."
</P>
<P>
The Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) has already asked the
Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) to determine whether the
suits meet the regulations set down by FINA.

urban waste a day.
</P>
<P>
The Sanfeng Science and Technology Industrial Company has three
urban waste disposal system with a combined handling capacity of
700 tons of waste per day.
</P>
<P>
The 400-ton production line can produce 100,000 tons to 200,000
tons of compound fertilizers annually, generating 2.4 million yuan
in profit per year, said Wang Yingbin, general manager of the
Company.
</P>
<P>
He said "Rubbish in cities is absolutely not waste. It is the
only resource that can maintain sustainable growth on Earth."
</P>
<P>
Wang started the Company in cooperation with the local
government and the Ministry of Science and Technology with a total
investment of 6.2 million yuan in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the common practice of burying waste, the new
waste disposal system not only saves land, but also helps prevent
environment pollution, saving the local government 400,000 yuan
each year, according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
Random disposal of garbage takes up large areas of land and
seriously pollutes air, rivers, lakes and ground water.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government allocated 2.18 billion yuan (265 million
U.S. dollars ) last year to waste disposal techniques.
</P>
<P>
The per capita garbage production in some 666 cities is 440
kilograms each year, with the annual volume growing by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Garbage dumps on 500 million square meters of land surround
than 200 Chinese cities, according to an earlier report by "
Science Times".
</P>
<P>
However, the environment and air quality in Guanghan has
greatly improved due to the new waste disposal systems.

<HEADLINE> China's Papermaking Industry Needs More Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- China's papermaking industry
needs 490 billion yuan (60 billion U.S. dollars) more in
investment to sustain its supply in the face of growing demand,
today's "Economic Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
By 2015, China's total consumption of paper and cardboard will
have amounted to 80 million tons, according to the China
Papermaking Association.
</P>
<P>
The demand requires an increase of production capacity which
calls for an extra 490 billion yuan investment, or an annual 32
billion yuan (3.9 billion U.S. dollars) investment.
</P>
<P>
The papermaking association estimates the increased production
capacity of paper and cardboard in 2015 will be 43 million tons,
while pulp will be 4.3 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Experts call for new ways of money-raising on the part of paper

<TEXT>
<P>
China classifies cases of corruption within the category of
state-owned enterprises as criminal cases, whereas corruption
cases within the category of private enterprises are classified as
civil cases, leading to more lenient penalties for the latter.
</P>
<P>
Sun Fuling, vice-chairman of the Ninth National Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Committee,
acknowledged that regardless of who owns assets, who uses them and
who benefits from them, they actually remain in China and benefit
the country.
</P>
<P>
Lack of regulations and laws concerning market operation have
been a major cause of corruption within the government departments.
</P>
<P>
China has a new constitution that gives equal emphasis to state-
owned, collectively-owned enterprises and private enterprises. And
what is crucial at present is to further strengthen the people's
legal consciousness, acquaint themselves with the related laws and
regulations, and enable them to know still more clearly their
rights and obligations concerning the laws, Sun said.

<HEADLINE> Private Enterprises Call for Legal Protection (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- China's old legal system should
be re-examined and amended to make way for a more just legal
system and to guarantee the future development of private
enterprises, according to "China Economic News".
</P>
<P>
A report to the 15th National Congress of Communist Party of
China (CPC) convened in 1997 and the new constitution passed at
the Second Session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC)
reiterates that private enterprises are an important, integral
part of China's economy. However, there are numerous legal
problems which have yet to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
After China enters the World Trade Organization (WTO),
investors from overseas will be allowed to enter many Chinese
economic sectors such as telecommunications, railways, banking and
finance, but domestic private enterprises will be not be granted
the same privilege.
</P>
<P>
This will discourage public investment, and hinder China's
positive financial policy, economists said, adding that the narrow
investment scope is a major reason for the country's current low
domestic investment level.
</P>
<P>
Illegal levies on private enterprises are existent far and wide
in China, but many are not aware of their legal rights.

Conference (CPPCC), today told visiting Singaporean Prime Minister
Goh Chok Tong that China is willing to learn from Singapore in

produced remarkable achievements over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, we also face a number of difficulties that must be
resolved such as oversupply of low-level production caused by an
irrational economic structure, reemployment and social security
issues brought about by establishment of modern enterprise system
among state-owned enterprises and laying off workers to increase
efficiency, and rampant corruption," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have been aware that all these problems appear in the

these problems through our own efforts. However, we consider that
it is very important to learn from and draw on the successful
experience of foreign countries," he said.
</P>

by all means and channels," Li said.

<HEADLINE> China to Better Protect Black Finless Dolphins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Experts from the Chinese Academy
of Sciences (CAS) said that the black finless dolphin is becoming
an endangered species in the Yangtze River and it should be better
protected, along with the white-finned dolphin.
</P>
<P>
The number of black finless dolphins, which have a habitat
similar to that of the white-finned dolphin, one of the world's
most endangered species, is less than 2,000, and compared with 2,
700 in 1993, their number is shrinking by more than 100 a year.
</P>
<P>
The biggest threats to the black finless dolphin is fishing,
shipping, water control projects, environmental pollution, and
other human activities on the Yangtze River, according to today's
Popular Science and Technology News.
</P>
<P>
These increase the danger of the species' existence because
they like to swim near the river banks, an expert from the
Institute of Hydrobiology under the CAS said.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese scholars in this field have united to suggest to
the government that the state protection level for the animal be
raised from second to first.
</P>
<P>
They also suggest that more effective measures and research
work be carried out to improve the living environment for the
animal and help it to thrive.

<HEADLINE> Sino-French Scientists Apply Remote Sensing Tech to Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and French scientists are
applying remote sensing technology to increase agricultural output
and promote environment-friendly agriculture.
</P>
<P>
A bilateral symposium was held recently in Beijing to promote
the cooperation, which started in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Tong Qingxi, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
said during the symposium that remote sensing technology may
monitor the outbreaks of crop diseases and insect rampage.
</P>
<P>
The information of remote sensing is significant to the policy-
makers of the country, the dealers on futures markets, and the
farmers, noted Tong.
</P>
<P>
The remote sensing result will also direct farmers on watering
and fertilizing to economize resources and decrease environmental
pollution.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Indonesia's Economy Improves As  Export Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- After the protracted economic and
financial crisis, value of Indonesia's export and import increased
significantly over the past months, showing a good progress of the
on-going economic recovery process.
</P>
<P>
Based on data issued by the Central Bureau of Statistic (BPS),
total export value during January 2000 reached 4.382 billion U.S.
dollars and increased again in February to 4.608 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, import also increased to 4.20 billion
dollars or 17.37 percent higher than the same period last year
when the figure was 3.58 billion dollars, the data showed.
</P>
<P>
Didik J. Rachbini, an economist of the Indonesian University,
said in an interview with Xinhua on Tuesday that the increase of
the total export value is a sign showing the country's economic
situation is improving.
</P>
<P>
"But actually, there are four components which should be used
to asses the economic situation comprehensively, namely,
consumption of the middle class society, export growth, investment
and budget," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the middle of last year, consumption of the middle class
society in Indonesia started improving, while export and import
also tended to increase, Rachbini said.
</P>
<P>
"But Indonesia has a problem in wooing investors due to lack of
security guarantee. And now, we have a lot of foreign debt that
has to be paid. These are problems for the country. And if such
problems can't be tackled well, (it) will hamper the recovery
process. But if settled well, the economic recovery process will
be faster," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chief of Export Department at the BPS Dantes
Simbolon, in a separate interview with Xinhua, predicted that the
country's export value in March will be higher than the January
and February figures.
</P>
<P>
Simbolon said that the total export value in January and
February 2000 were 44.70 percent higher than the January-February
1999 figure when the country's total export value was 3.017,8
billion and 3.195 billion dollars, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Central Bureau of Statistic Sugito Suwito
earlier also said that the increase of the export value was a sign
that the country's economy has been recovering.
</P>
<P>
Sugito explained that the increase of the total export value
for January-February this year was contributed by the increasing
of oil and gas export which reached 2.24 billion dollars or 82.90
percent higher than the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
And the total export value of non-oil and gas reached 6.75
billion dollars or 35.34 percent higher than the same period last
year when the figure was 4.99 billion dollars, Suwito added.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia May Buy Russian Helicopters: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia may buy the Russian-
made MI-17 multi-role helicopters to replace the aging Nuri
helicopters, Defense Minister Najib Tun Razak said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) may consider buying a
fleet of 10 MIs initially, Najib told reporters after opening the
7th Defence Services Asia Exhibition and Conference here.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not specify which version or the costs involved,
saying "we've not yet gone into actual contract. Still negotiating.
"
</P>
<P>
The minister said there are still few matters to be ironed out
such as the technical specifications.
</P>
<P>
The MI-17 is manufactured by Kazan Helicopters, one of the
primary manufacturers of medium-sized helicopters in the world.
</P>
<P>
Currently two MI-17s are in service with the Fire and Rescue
Service in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The RMAF has acquired 16 Russian-made MiG-29 fighter jets and
two MiG-29UB combat trainers under a 1994 contract.

KAMPALA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan State Minister for

<HEADLINE> Zambia Plans to Set up Export Processing Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government is
considering the establishment of Export Processing Zones (EPZ) in
strategic locations of the country to promote investment in the
manufacturing industry.
</P>
<P>
According to Tuesday's Times of Zambia newspaper, the
government was seriously looking at this issue, saying that it is
expected to set up zones in the agro processing industry which
was the key sector to the economic and sustainable development of
this country.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the ministries of finance and commerce were
still doing some consultations on this matter to review the
consensus and their progressive program.
</P>
<P>
The pre-study was undertaken by the Ministry of Commerce in
1998 and it was discovered that the free zones in the context of
Zambia being landlocked could not be operated in the same manner
with countries that had direct access to the sea ports.
</P>
<P>
The study proposed a modification of traditional processing
zone format to suit the Zambian situation.
</P>
<P>
Zambia was still learning from the experience of Egypt and
Kenya on how they have established the processing zones, the paper
said.

<HEADLINE> HK's Tung Expects Disneyland to Boost Local Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 10 (Xinhua)-- Visiting Chief Executive of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), Tung Chee Hwa,
Monday expressed confidence that the proposed Hong Kong Disneyland
will strengthen the local economy and bring the region's tourism
to world-class standard.
</P>
<P>
An agreement on building the amusement park was reached last
year after nine-month negotiations between the HKSAR government
and Walt Disney Corporation. Tung visited the Disneyland and
Disney University in Southern California Monday morning before his
meeting with Walt Disney executives in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the press in the company's headquarters, Tung said
Disney's innovative technology would help upgrade Hong Kong's
entertainment industry. The project will also benefit other
sectors and communities in Hong Kong by offering development and
employment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing his visit to Canada and the United States, Tung said
his meetings with U.S. and Canadian leaders as well as officials
in commercial, industrial and political arenas have been very
useful.
</P>
<P>
"I clearly have the feeling that both the United States and
Canada recognize the fact that 'one country, two systems' has been
successful in Hong Kong. Both countries want to have even closer
economical and trade relations with Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
During his meetings with U.S. President Bill Clinton and
members of Congress, Tung said he stressed the importance of
granting China permanent normal trade relations status.
</P>
<P>
"This is not just good for Hong Kong's economy which is in the
process of recovery, not only good for China, but also very good
for the United States," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to environmental protection, Tung said he visited
the environmental protection department in Toronto, Canada, and
will visit similar agencies in Los Angeles and Southern California
"to learn how they are going with environmental protection,
particularly in the area of air quality which is the issue Hong
Kong is most concerned with."
</P>
<P>
Answering a question about Taiwan, Tung said: "As a Chinese
and the chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region, I strongly wish our country would realize reunification as
early as possible on the basis of 'one China', and 'one country,
two systems'."
</P>
<P>
When Taiwan embraces the "one country, two systems" system,
Tung said, the mechanism will not necessarily be exactly the same
as Hong Kong's, because Taiwan and Hong Kong have different
backgrounds.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economy Predicted to Remain Robust in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The dynamics of the U.S.
economy and housing market are changing but still favorable,
according to a report released Monday.
</P>
<P>
Higher interest rates, volatility in the stock market and
rising oil prices are starting to erode consumer confidence and
will dampen economic growth, said the report from the National
Association of Realtors (NAR), America's largest trade association.
</P>
<P>
"However, housing demand continues to be strong and mortgage
financing remains fairly affordable, so this year will still be in
the top three as far as markets go."
</P>
<P>
According to the NAR, part of the current housing market's
strength results from equity gains in both home ownership and the
stock market. With increasing volatility in the stock market, more
people would diversify their portfolios by investing in real
property.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Allen Iverson's 33 points led
the Philadelphia 76ers to a 96-80 win over Miami on Monday night,
ending the Heat's seven-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
Eric Snow scored 12 points and 10 assists for Philadephia,
which stayed in fourth place in the Eastern Conference standings,
one game ahead of Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
Miami led early, but Iverson led his team back with 18 first-
half points. His layup with 9:08 left in the half made it 29-26
for Philadelphia, which never trailed again.
</P>
<P>
Tim Hardaway of Miami played just three minutes in the fourth
quarter and scored only four points. Jamal Mashburn led the Heat
with 16 points and eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
In Toronto, Raptors outclassed Cleveland 112-103. Vince Carter'
s first career triple-double helped Toronto inch closer to its
first playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
Carter went 13-of-19 from the field and scored 31 points, had
11 rebounds and added a career-high 10 assists. Tracy McGrady
collected 27 points. Shawn Kemp had 22 points for Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Charlotte Hornets defeated Wizards 107-105.
Elden Campbell's 5 meter turnaround jumper as time expired capped
a wild finish for Charlotte, which has won nine of its last 11
games.
</P>
<P>
Eddie Jones scored 26 points and David Wesley had 21 for the
Hornets. Mitch Richmond had 21 points and reserve Richard Hamilton
19 for the Wizards, who had won 8 of 11.
</P>
<P>
The game was tied at 103 when Anthony Mason hit a 3 meter with
2.8 seconds left for a 105-103 lead. Richmond was fouled on the
ensuing inbounds play and hit both free throws, tying the game at
105 and setting up Campbell's game-winner.
</P>
<P>
In Boston, Celtics beat Hawks 99-94. Antoine Walker scored 26
of his 34 points in the second half, including a 3-pointer with 25
seconds left to cap a game-ending 11-0 Boston rally.
</P>
<P>
The win snapped Boston's 10 game-losing skid, its longest since
1997. Kenny Anderson was the only other Boston player in double
figures, with 24 points.
</P>
<P>
In New York, Knicks edged Pacers 83-81. Patrick Ewing made a
turnaround jumper with two seconds left, and apparently redirected
Larry Johnson's earlier 3-pointer into the basket, to lead New
York.
</P>
<P>
Ewing scored nine of the Knicks' final 12 points and appeared
to have a hand in the other three.
</P>
<P>
Reggie Miller tied the game at 81-81 on two foul shots with 15.
7 seconds left. The Knicks then got the ball to Ewing (20 points)
in the low post, and he sank a trademark fadeaway shot.
</P>
<P>

33 points, and Sam Cassell added 18 points and eight assists as
Milwaukee moved one game behind Orlando for the Eastern Conference

</P>
<P>
In Minneapolis, Timberwolves routed Detroit Pistons 102-100.
Kevin Garnett of Minnesota shot in a 10-foot jumper at the horn.
Garnett scored 25 points, and Terrell Brandon added 16.
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, LA Lakers eliminated Seattle 106-103. Kobe
Bryant scored five of his 33 points in overtime as Los Angeles won
without Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
O'Neal, the NBA's leading scorer and second-leading rebounder,
sat out his second game because of a sprained left ankle.
</P>
<P>
In Salt Lake City, Portland Trail Blazers overwhelmed Utah Jazz
90-86. Greg Anthony's 3-pointer with 21.8 seconds remaining gave
Portland a 3-1 win of the season series between the teams.

<HEADLINE> China Puts Leaning Building Back to Right Position </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chinese architecture
experts have announced that they have successfully put a leaning
building back to the right position in downtown Harbin, capital
city of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
They said that the work was done in 1998, "close observations
in the past one and a half years showed that the building was in a
stable condition after being erected".
</P>
<P>
The Qilu Mansion, 28-floor and 96 meters in height, was found
leaning with its gradient nearly three times higher than permitted.
A group of experts from the Heilongjiang Provincial Academy of
City Planning and Design and the Beijing Jiaotong University were
asked to erect the leaning building.
</P>
<P>
The experts dug several upright wells on the opposite side of
the building's leaning direction, and then used high-pressure
water to wash out unwanted ground-soils to force the building into
the right position.

<HEADLINE> Sugar Output Falls in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cane crushing season completed toward end-March when the
country's sugar mills switched off their boilers.
</P>
<P>
A latest report of the PSMA said with an average recovery rate
of 8.32 percent sucrose from the sugarcane, sugar factories have
produced 2.412 million tons of sugar. This year the cane quantity
crushed dropped by one million tons to 29 million tons against the
figures recorded last year.
</P>
<P>
At the start of the season in October-November 1999, the
government had predicted that the production figures would reach
the 3.5 million tons mark.
</P>
<P>
Domestic requirement of the commodity is calculated at about
three million tons. Thus there is a gap of about 0.6 million tons
in the production and consumption figures.
</P>
<P>
To fill the gap, importers have already started booking of
cargoes in the international market.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Stresses Unity Among NAM Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has stressed the need for
unity among member countries of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM),
saying that at the start of the new century, developing countries
are faced with an international environment where the strong still
persist in their design to impose their values on others.
</P>
<P>
In his policy statement delivered at the plenary session of the
13th Ministerial Conference of the NAM held in Cartagena, Colombia
last Saturday, Myanmar Foreign Minister U Win Aung charged that
the noble institutions of the United Nations System are being used
by the strong to further their national interest and to exert
undue pressure on developing countries, official newspaper The New
Light of Myanmar reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is distressed by a trend of increasing tendency to use
or rather misuse the issues of democracy, human rights and
environment by strong and powerful countries to put undue pressure
on developing countries in the interest furthering their hidden
political or economic agenda.
</P>
<P>
The developing countries find themselves in situation where
negatives are accentuated and the positives completely ignored by
international media, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Myanmar has been the target of political pressure
by some western countries and is accused of practicing forced
labor.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the regret that the International Labor
Organization (ILO) persists in carrying out concerted action to
take drastic measures against Myanmar at the forthcoming
International Labor Conference.
</P>
<P>
He hopes the NAM member countries will regard this ILO attempt
as a coercive action taken against a fellow developing country for
reason which he said entirely unrelated to the promotion of rights
of labor.
</P>
<P>
On Yugoslavia issue, he said Myanmar hopes to see the creation
of conditions which would enable Yugoslavia to rejoin soonest the
NAM of which that country has been a founding member.
</P>
<P>
The minister emphasized the need for peace and security for
economic development of all nations, saying that Myanmar, in line
with its independent and active foreign policy and upholding the
principles of peaceful coexistence, maintains friendly ties with
all nations in the world.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the new century, the developing countries are
faced with the impossible task of managing their domestic
economies in an increasingly integrated global economy.
</P>
<P>
In wake of the East Asian crisis, which is a crisis of
globalization, he stressed the need for the reform of the
international financial system.
</P>
<P>
In the new century, unity among NAM member countries is more
urgent than ever, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is a founding member of the NAM. The country once
suspended its participation in the movement in 1979 but resumed
its activities beginning with the 10th NAM Summit in Indonesia in
September 1992.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Business Summit Opens in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 11 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN Business Summit 2000
with the theme "Asia 2000: Moving Forward" opened here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The two-day summit will discuss on how ASEAN in the new
millennium can sustain recovery and enhance integration, how the
changes in world geo-political power are affecting ASEAN, what are
foreign investors' perspectives of ASEAN, how to enhance growth in
East Asia through closer collaboration, how ASEAN can meet the
challenges ahead,and on strategies and collective initiatives that
can be taken to regain ASEAN's economic competitiveness in the
wake of the new economy of globalization.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi
officiated the summit on behalf of his Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad who went to Havana to attend the G-77 summit.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah read out Mahathir's speech at the opening in which
Mahathir outlined three key issues -- globalization,
liberalization and mega-mergers -- ASEAN should focus upon to
achieve its goals of establishing ASEAN of a concert and a
community of Southeast Asian nations, outward looking, living in
peace, stability and prosperity, bonded together in partnership in
dynamic development and in a community of caring societies by the
year 2020.
</P>
<P>
On globalization, Mahathir said "The globalization can be good
if we have a say in its interpretation. It will be good if we can
have some control over the movements across our borders."
</P>
<P>
He said "We should say: no globalization without benefit, no
globalization without self determination, and no globalization
without corporate responsibility or conscience."
</P>
<P>
On the issue of liberalization, he said domestic liberalization
and cross-border liberalization, and national market
liberalization and international market liberalization should be
distinguished.
</P>
<P>
"Even as we say a qualified 'yes' to international
liberalization,we should say: no international liberalization
without benefit, no international liberalization without self-
determination, no international liberalization without regulation,
no international liberalization without representation, and no
international liberalization without corporate responsibility and
conscience."
</P>
<P>
On the global mega-mergers, Mahathir said "These global mega-
mergers may be great for others. But the question has to be asked:
is it good for us?"
</P>
<P>
The summit is jointly organized by the National Chamber of
Commerce and Industry of Malaysia (NCCIM) and the Asian Strategy
Leadership Institute under the auspices of the ASEAN Chamber of
Commerce and Industry.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Crack Down on Errant Job Agencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka will take action
against errant employment agencies who send job seekers to foreign
countries on student visas, the Bureau of Foreign Employment said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the bureau said those errant employment
agencies had sent more than 300 Sri Lankans to Cyprus during the
past few months on student visas promising them employment there.
</P>
<P>
However, those job seekers now face punitive action and
deportation in Cyprus, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
According to the existing migrant laws in Cyprus, foreigners
with student visas are not allowed to seek employment.
</P>
<P>
At present nearly 7,700 Sri Lankan workers are legally employed
in Cyprus, out of whom 5,200 are employed as housemaids.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan job seekers are allowed to be employed legally in
Cyprus only if they have a valid employment certificate from the
Bureau of Foreign Employment, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Mindanao Mayors Call for Extension of Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Mayors in the southern Philippines
have asked President Joseph Estrada to extend for one more year
the peace negotiations between the government and the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF), Philippine News Agency said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The request came after an earlier deadline set by the president
for the negotiating parties to wrap up their talks by June this
year.
</P>
<P>
The League of Municipal Mayors in Maguindanao province,
Mindanao said the extension, once heard, will enable the
government to convert acknowledged MILF camps into economic zones.
</P>
<P>
Taking cue from the conversion of Datu Paglas town, once a
known lair of Moro rebels, into an income-generating zone by the
coming in of Canadian-supported projects, South Upi mayor Michael
Sinsuat, the province's mayor's league president, said the
municipality is now the recipient of some 48 million U.S. dollars
worth of investments.
</P>
<P>
"There are hundreds of MILF rebels in Dat Paglas but they do
not carry their firearms because they work together in a big
banana plantation there," Sinsuat was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sinsuat stressed that the conversion of MILF claimed
territories into economic zones would be a better approach in
resolving conflict in the area.
</P>
<P>
"Surely, if we can just provide jobs to these rebels and give
them support like farming ventures, they will do away with their
guns and cooperate with the government," Sinsuat said.
</P>
<P>
He also assured the 100-percent support of the local chief
executives in the economic conversion of the MILF territories if
the extension appeal is okayed by President Estrada.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Troops Recover Lost Supply Route </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ministry said in a statement that ground troops backed by
air cover, artillery and the navy were able to wrest the three
kilometer stretch of highway between Muhamalai and Pallai on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The dawn-to-dusk operation met with heavy resistance from
rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) who were
using machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades, mortars and
artillery, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It said 11 government troops personnel were killed and 190
wounded,most with minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
Rebel casualties are not known but estimated to be very high.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels, fighting for a separate homeland for minority
Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983, had gained
control of a part of the supply route in a surprise attack
recently designed to cut off the strategic Elephant Pass military
base from the Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The capturing of Elephant Pass, a vital road bridge linking the
mainland and the Jaffna peninsula, is LTTE's first step of their
efforts to retake the former stronghold of Jaffna which they lost
to government troops in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Infamous Military Agency Dissolved in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ceremony for the Bakorstanas closure was held in the
Indonesian Military (TNI) headquarters in East Jakarta Monday. It
was a followup of the presidential decree issued on March 10, 2000.
President Abdurrahman Wahid ordered the dissolution of the agency
in response to public criticism.
</P>
<P>
Following the official dissolution of the agency, the majority
of the archives compiled by the agency will be destroyed soon.
</P>
<P>
"The larger part of Bakorstanas' database is related to persons
and groups. This (information) will be annihilated because it is
no longer needed," Lt. Gen. Djamari Chaniago, general affairs
chief for the TNI,was quoted by the Jakarta Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Bakorstanas was established by former president Soeharto in
September 1988 to replace the Operational Command for the
Restoration of Security and Order. The agency was founded to deal
with any perceived problems to the country's stability.
</P>
<P>
The agency screened prospective state officials and also was
reportedly used by Soeharto's New Order administration to silence
government critics and take action against anyone believed to have
links with the banned Indonesian Communist Party.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Animal Welfare
Society has assured month-long feeding and "medical mission" on
farm animals affected by the last eruptions of Mt. Mayon,
Philippine News Agency(PNA) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The week-long eruptions of Mayon volcano later in February had
affected not only humans inhabiting the slopes of the volcano but
also farm animals abounding the area, the PNA said.
</P>
<P>
At least 49 heads of cattle upslope of the village Matanag in
Legazpi city were confirmed to have died from the ultra hot
volcanic materials spawned by the volcano and more have died due
to illness acquired from inhaling ash-laden air.
</P>
<P>
Local agriculture officials earlier reported an over 400 heads
of cows, carabaos and goats suffering from various illnesses and
which had 'lost their appetite' due to massive inhalation of ashes.
</P>
<P>
These aside from those who were seen by farmers as hopeless to
recover and had already been sold at a cheap price. Society
veterinarians who arrived there last week, however,appealed to
farmers to defer plans of selling their sick animals,swearing they
will exhaust all efforts in reviving them.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Chamber of Commerce Launches Ads Campaign for China PNTR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States Chamber of
Commerce will kick off a pro-trade ad campaign on Tuesday to
prepare for the final showdown on Capitol Hill over normal trade
status with China later this month.
</P>
<P>
The Chamber, in a series of media commercials, will also charge
union leaders of misleading their members and the public about the
importance of free trade.
</P>
<P>
"Our ads point out the truth about trade with China. Free trade
will bring greater opportunity for American workers and farmers.
It will also bring greater opportunity to the Chinese people,"
said Thomas Donohue, Chamber President and CEO.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Union leaders who have planned a Washington rally
against free trade for Wednesday on April 12, Donohue said, "Don't
want to see this happen," since they are pursuing their own
political agenda.
</P>
<P>
Congress is scheduled to vote on whether to extend Permanent
Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) to China in the week of May 22, in
order to benefit from a negotiated trade deal with the country
last November. The Chamber has called the trade deal "critical" to
American interests and urged members of Congress to grant PNTR
when it comes up for a vote.
</P>
<P>
"Let's be clear," Donohue said. "Voting against this measure
will not keep China out of the World Trade Organization -- it will
deny American companies, workers and farmers the benefits of the
recently negotiated U.S.- China trade deal that lowers barriers to
American goods and services."
</P>
<P>
The Chamber's print commercials are scheduled to run in Roll
Call and The Washington Post. Radio ads are also scheduled for
WTOP-AM/FM and the local broadcast of Imus in the Morning.
</P>
<P>
The media effort is part of a larger Chamber initiative to
ensure passage of PNTR for China, which involves 13 field
representatives in congressional districts around the country, and
15 Washington-based lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is the world's largest business
federation representing more than three million businesses and
organizations of every size, sector and region.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Shuttlers Told to be Wary of Japanese in Uber Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian women's shuttlers
shouldn't take their Japanese rivals lightly when they meet in the
opening match of the Uber Cup pink group in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia,
next month according to the Jakarta Post Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Runner-up Indonesia is in the same group with Japan, Denmark
and Malaysia while defending champion China is in the purple group
with South Korea, Sweden and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The Badminton Association of Indonesia (PBSI) official in
charge of athlete development Mangombar Ferdinand Siregar said
that the national team's shuttlers must win against the Japanese
in the tie on May 11 because they would face a tougher challenge
against Denmark.
</P>
<P>
"In the just concluded Japan Open, I noted the threat from two
Japanese shuttlers, Yasuko Mizui and Kanako Yonekura, and their
young doubles pairing," he said.
</P>
<P>
Young Indonesian shuttler Yuli Marfuah suffered a humiliating 1-
11,0-11 thrashing by Mizui in the first round of the Japan Open
lastweek.
</P>
<P>
"If we aim to reach the semifinals, we must beat Japan and
Malaysia We will be stretched to overcome Denmark as it has
Camilla Martin and Mette Sorensen in the singles and Rikke Olsen
and Helene Kirkegaard in the doubles," Siregar said.
</P>
<P>
With Indonesia's top singles Cindana Hartono ruled out of the
tie by injury, PBSI is relying on Lidya Djaelawidjaja and Ellen
Angelina.
</P>
<P>
"I think Lidya has learned a lot from her experience in New
Delhi. She's more prepared to become the first singles," he said.
</P>
<P>
Siregar said he discussed Cindana's condition with PBSI doctor
Michael Triangto.
</P>
<P>
"Cindana was able to run but I want to see her performance on
thecourt. We'll see how she performs in the simulation late this
month," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the likelihood of retaining the Thomas Cup, Siregar
said Indonesia had a better chance in the event as it would
meetSweden in the opening match also on May 11. Indonesia is in
the yellow group with Sweden, England and China.
</P>
<P>
Runner-up Denmark is in blue group with host Malaysia, South
Korea and India.

BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A new official website will
provide trade for idle state-owned equipment and facilities at an
estimated value of "a couple of hundred billion" yuan, according
to "China Business Times".
</P>

Planning Commission. It includes 67 kinds of equipment, detailed
information on its database and offers sales, lease, auctions and

</P>
<P>
According to a survey conducted by the association, idle state
assets account for eight percent of total state assets in China
due to construction of redundant projects and recent economic
restructuring.
</P>

The poor management and maintenance of equipment has incurred
huge waste. Total trade volume of equipment in 1999 stood at a

<HEADLINE> G-77 Worried About Development Aid Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Group of 77 expressed concern
Monday for what it described as the continual descent of official
assistance from rich countries to developing nations.
</P>
<P>
"We're exhorting developed countries to fulfill their
commitment to direct 0.7 of their gross domestic product (GDP) for
official development assistance," G-77 said in a draft joint
declaration.
</P>
<P>
In 1970, the United Nations General Assembly established the
goal for wealthy countries to earmark 0.7 percent of their GDP for
assistance to developing countries. Currently, only four --
Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden -- have reached or
surpassed that mark. A majority of industrialized in the north
have failed to comply with their pledged development assistance.
</P>
<P>
The north-south dialogue is on top of the agenda of the South
Summit of G-77, slated for April 10-14, the largest gathering of
heads of state or government since the 1964 founding of the
organization.
</P>
<P>
Official Development Assistance from the north to the south in
1992 reached 61 billion U.S. dollars. By 1997, the total had
fallen to 47.6 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
With the exception of the United States, all members of OCED,
which unites the world's wealthiest nations, have reaffirmed their
pledge to bring development assistance for the south up to 0.7
percent of their respective GDPs.
</P>
<P>
G-77 also showed concern for Africa, saying the debt's growth,
reduction of official development assistance, and the fall of its
products' prices have worsened economic and social conditions in
the continent, according to the draft document.
</P>
<P>
The Group of 77, with Nigeria holding its Chairmanship for the
year 2000, was established on June 15, 1964, by 77 developing
countries in Geneva. Although the membership of G-77 has increased
to 133 countries, the original name was retained because of its
historic significance.

<HEADLINE> Venture-Backed Companies Account for Majority of U.S. IPOs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Venture-backed companies
continued to account for the bulk of U.S. initial public offerings
(IPOs) in the first quarter of 2000, an information service firm
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Of the 139 offerings of the past quarter, 75 received venture
funding prior to the offering -- accounting for 53.8 percent of
the total, compared to 26 companies that went public a year ago,
said Venture Economics, the U.S. forecast information provider for
private equity professionals worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Even with the recent market turmoil, the firm said, the U.S.
market's appetite for new venture-backed issues continues strong
even as it shows some signs of slowing. Venture-backed companies
account for a full 65 percent, or 181, of the 277 companies
currently registered.
</P>
<P>
These impressive numbers follow on the hot performance of
venture-backed IPOs in 1999, when venture-backed IPOs returned 92.
6 percent for the year, according to Venture Economics.
</P>
<P>
In the benchmark year of 1996, the 280 venture-backed IPOs
accounted for just 32 percent of the initial public offering
market.
</P>
<P>
There are signs that the market is less sanguine about the
issues coming to market, the firm pointed out. While the average
offer size and the total post offer value of IPOs increased in the
first quarter, the average post offer value -- the market value of
the company at the offer price -- decreased from the 1999 fourth
quarter highs.
</P>
<P>
The average size for venture-backed IPOs in the first quarter
leaped to 102 million U.S. dollars, far outpacing the 67-million-
dollar average in the first quarter of 1999. The average post
offer value, however, decreased from 577 million dollars in the
last quarter of 1999 to 523 million dollars in the first quarter
of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead the rest of the year, which experienced a turmoil
in the first few days in April, Venture Economics predicted that "
this year will be a watershed year to validate the information
technology investments made in the last three years."
</P>
<P>
Currently, the firm said, the IPO market continues to fuel the
expectations of both public and private investors. "The private
and public markets have become inextricably intertwined in recent
years," the firm said. "The public markets provide the liquidity
and lubrication that have reaped substantial rewards for the
venture capital company, their investors and their investee
companies. With record amounts of capital coming into the venture
industry and the growing skepticism in the press about the ability
of dot.com companies to sustain their business models, it is
encouraging to see that the public markets continue to be
receptive to new issues this year."

<HEADLINE> Shandong to Enlarge Swan Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Swan Lake in Rongcheng City,
the world's largest habitat for swans in east China's Shandong
Province, is to be enlarged from 6,600 to more than 10,000
hectares with a total investment of 25 million yuan (3.01 million
US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The lake, which is an ideal habitat for swans in winter,
attracts thousands of swans from Siberia every year to spend
winter.
</P>
<P>
In addition to its picturesque coastal scenery, the lake has
also become a famous tourism attraction to large numbers of
overseas and domestic tourists.
</P>
<P>
Rongcheng, at the eastern end of the Shandong Peninsula, has
made great effort to improve the environment over the past decade.
It has also carried out a series of protection projects on the
lake, habitat of swan and other rare birds.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1990s, more and more swans have flocked to the
lake in winter, said a local waterfowl expert, but the increasing
number of the swans also brought some problems. The lake cannot
provide sufficient food and cruising space for swans.
</P>
<P>
The enlargement project will solve these problems and offer the
swans a more comfortable living environment.

<HEADLINE> Spring Wheat Harmed by Adverse Weather in Northeast China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The planting of spring wheat is
slow due to bad climate, which will most likely lead a poor
harvest this year, according to the agricultural department of
Liaoning province, northeast China.
</P>
<P>
Snow, followed by cold weather, appeared in most areas of the
province in the past few weeks. As a result, spring wheat planting
fields are about 55,900 hectares, nearly 6,666 hectares less than
last year.
</P>
<P>
Investigation carried out by the department said that situation
is worse because of heavy snow and sharp temperature drop in the
areas such as Shenyang, capital of the province, and Anshan, a
major base of Chinese steel industry, in the northern and central
part of the province.
</P>
<P>
However, despite adverse weather conditions, farmers can grow
other crops and the total annual output of grain in Liaoning will
not be much affected, according to the department.

<HEADLINE> China to Cut Fees, Fines For Rural Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Agriculture,
trying to relieve financial burdens on township enterprises,
pledged Monday to eliminate unreasonable charges that hold back
the rural economy.
</P>
<P>
The State Development Planning Commission and the Ministry of
Finance will list unwarranted fees charged to township firms, and
the Ministry of Agriculture will ensure that these items are
canceled this year, today's China Daily quoted Lu Yongjun, vice
director of the ministry's Township Management Bureau, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Fines, arbitrary quotas and other charges to companies that
operate in China's rural areas have cut their profits by an
average 20 percent, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
China's 20 million township-run firms employed 125 million
workers, mostly rural residents, and generated a combined added-
value of 2,500 billion yuan(301 billion U.S. dollars) in 1999.
</P>
<P>
More money would have been earned and spent had the businesses
been spared multiple illegal charges, which Lu's bureau estimates
exceeded 110 billion yuan in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Lu said local governments hamper business with arbitrary or
redundant charges including insurance premiums, hospital
construction fees and forced quotas.
</P>
<P>
"We should realize that township industry has become a major
contributor to the country's economic growth."
</P>
<P>
One-third of farmers' annual income and China's gross domestic
product(GDP) come from township enterprises, which may employ
people who live on farms, he noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations called for
global efforts Monday to deal with the increase in global crime.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Deputy Secretary General Louise Frechette told the 10th U.
N. Conference on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of
Offenders that it was more important than ever to unite
governments, professional crime fighters, and other key players in
law enforcement to combat criminal opportunities created by
globalization.
</P>
<P>
"If criminals are going global, those authorities fighting them
must also launch a global effort and create effective networks for
technical, legal and judicial cooperation, or they will always be
one step behind," she said.
</P>
<P>
While globalization has had many positive effects, Frechette
said, some people have "jumped on the bandwagon of globalization
to create transnational criminal networks, and so boost profits
from a wide range of illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
"To them, opening borders means it is easier to traffic in
women and children for forced labor and prostitution, to smuggle
drugs and arms, and to escape prosecution," she said.

Some 2,000 government officials and experts are attending the
meeting, which will end here next Monday.

To fuel the park's take-off, the financial institutions pledge
to provide further assistance.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing outlet of China's Construction Bank has listed the
park as one of its main investment fields, said Zhou Zaiqun, the
outlet director.
</P>
<P>
The bank outlet will grant the enterprises and research
institutions related to the parks at least 10 billion yuan (1.2
billion U.S. dollars) in loans this year, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the loans will be put into the park's construction and
commercialization of its high-tech fruits."
</P>
<P>
The outlet has signed cooperative agreements worth five billion
yuan (602 million dollars) with five universities and seven high-
tech enterprises in the park.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are 68 universities and 213 research
institutions and 6,700 hi-tech firms within the park. Zhou said
the bank will further simplify examination procedures when
extending loans to the park.
</P>
<P>
The China Development Bank will also provide more loans for the
park's construction and high-tech commercialization projects.
</P>
<P>
The park, founded last June with the approval of the State
Council, will focus its development on information technology,
bioengineering and new medicine sectors within the next 10 years.

<HEADLINE> Rising Prices Drive Domestic Tourists Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey in "China Youth
Daily" by the National Tourism Administration showed that a large
number of tourists preferred trips abroad to traveling at home.
</P>
<P>
The Administration attributed the change to price hikes in
several domestic tourist resorts during the lunar new year
holidays, which made domestic travel even more expensive than
trips abroad.
</P>
<P>
Trips to Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam became
attractive to Chinese tourists thanks to the comparatively low
charges.
</P>
<P>
Many tourist cities including Guilin, in the south Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region, and Sanya, in Hainan province increased
accommodation prices as well as admission fees to resort areas
during the Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
Analysts pointed out that the average consumption level of
Chinese citizens is quite low although more and more people are
making short-term trips during long holidays.

<HEADLINE> UEFA to Rule on Leeds' Fan Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- European soccer governing body
UEFA will decide on Wednesday whether Turkish fans should be
banned from second leg of the UEFA Cup semi-final match in Leeds
on April 20.
</P>
<P>
UEFA confirmed it had received a request from Leeds and the
Football Association to bar the Turkish side's supporters.
</P>
<P>
The call came after two Leeds fans, Chris Loftus and Kevin
Speight were stabbed to death during riots on the eve of the first
leg in Istanbul, which Galatasaray won 2-0.
</P>
<P>
Leeds has been asked by UEFA whether it could guarantee
security if Turkish fans were admitted to the ground.
</P>
<P>
UEFA has also asked Galatasaray to withhold its 1,700 ticket
allocation until a decision is made.
</P>
<P>
Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale said he believed UEFA will
support the club's request due to reprisal fears.
</P>
<P>
Turgay Vardar, spokesman for Galatasaray, said the club
canceled a plan on Monday to send a letter to UEFA requesting
details on security measures at Leeds.
</P>
<P>
Vardar said the club would wait for Leeds' response before
deciding whether to seek a neutral venue or ask that Leeds fans
also be banned.
</P>
<P>
UEFA officials were meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, on Monday
to decide what arrangements should be made for the flashpoint
match.
</P>
<P>
After the deaths of the two supporters, Leeds United officials
and fans were incensed that a minute's silence was not observed
before the game and that Galatasaray fans made slitting motions
towards the English fans.
</P>
<P>
Ten Turkish youths detained in the stabbing deaths of the two
Leeds men were released on Monday, while eight others were still
being held.
</P>
<P>
One man has reportedly confessed to one of the killings.

<HEADLINE> Wembley Stadium Redevelopment Faces Major Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The redevelopment of English
flagship stadium Wembley could be delayed for up to a year in a
row over the cost of building the new stadium.
</P>
<P>
Brent Council is due to announce the result of the planning
application for the new national football stadium on 25 April.
</P>
<P>
But a 30 million pounds short fall in the budget may mean that
necessary improvements to the rail and road links to the stadium
cannot be carried out.
</P>
<P>
If this is the case, the application is likely to be turned
down,causing a major delay in the redevelopment of the site that
is to be the jewel in the crown of England's 2006 World Cup bid.
</P>
<P>
The consortium behind the new Wembley is likely to appeal to
the Department of Environment if planning permission is rejected,
which could lead to a delay of anything up to 12 months.
</P>
<P>
Wembley spokesman Chris Palmer said: "Our chief executive Bob
Stubbs met with the director of environmental services at the
council last week and was told that members of the council had
told him to stick to the 30 million pounds.
</P>
<P>
"If they continue with that it means they will reject our
application, and we will have to go to appeal. That would lead to
a 12-month delay and put the completion date back to 2004, but
there is no question of the 2006 World Cup bid being compromised,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
September's World Cup qualifying tie between England and
Germany was to be the old stadium's last match, although that
situation may now change.
</P>
<P>
Construction work has already been put back twice and a plan to
include athletics was ditched last year following a row over the
addition of a running track.

<HEADLINE> Clerides Urges Discussing Core Issues on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
on Tuesday called on the two sides on the divided island to discuss
core issues concerning the reunification of the tiny country.
</P>
<P>
Clerides, leader of the Greek Cypriots who predominantly reside
in the south, made the appeal upon his arrival at the airport in
the southern coast city of Larnaca from visits to the U.S. and
Britain.
</P>
<P>
He said that he and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash have
already put forward their positions on the Cyprus issue and given
their clarifications during the first two rounds of U.N.-sponsored
proximity talks in New York and Geneva.
</P>
<P>
They will hold another round of talks in New York on May 23.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in the U.S., Clerides met with U.S. Presidential
Emissary for Cyprus Alfred Moses, State Department Coordinator
Thomas Weston and U.N. Secretary-General's special envoy for Cyprus
Alvaro de Soto.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said the foreign envoys for Cyprus "all agreed that the
talks beginning on May 23 must be upgraded and the core issues
discussed."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has identified constitution, territory, property and
distribution of powers as the four core issues that need to be
tackled during the talks.
</P>
<P>
Clerides recalled, however, that Denktash repeated during the
two rounds of talks that he refused to negotiate with the Greek
Cypriot side unless his breakaway state in northern Cyprus is
recognized.
</P>
<P>
He said the foreign officials have "underlined to both Denktash
and Ankara that they will neither recognize his regime nor
acknowledge it."
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots unilaterally announced the formation of a "
Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" in November 15, 1983. But it
was recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Clerides noted that if the third round of talks do not bear
fruit "we will reassess the situation."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island in the wake of a failed pro-Athens
coup in Nicosia.

<HEADLINE> International Help to Remove Mines in Arab World Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Arab and international landmine
experts on Tuesday called for more international help to remove
land mines in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made at a three-day regional workshop on mines
hosted by the Arab League here. The experts asked the world
community, the countries planting the mines in particular, to
provide financial and technical support to clear the mines.
</P>
<P>
They said in a final statement that the support was essential "
to heal the problems of the disabled caused by mines and the loss
of human and animal lives and agriculture."
</P>
<P>
Two-fifths of the world's land mines were scattered on Arab
soil, left over from the World War II and the Arab-Israeli
conflicts. Egypt alone has 19.7 million mines laid by Britain,
Germany and Italy in the Western Desert during the world war.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has called on the three countries to provide fund, maps of
mine fields and equipment for mine clearance. It sees their current
aid as meager.
</P>
<P>
A United Nations team visited Egypt in February to assess the
land mine problem, but has yet to release its findings.

CAIRO -- Egypt's parliament has approved amendments to laws
regulating legislative elections which will take place later this
year with the aim of securing a trouble-free vote, the country's
Middle East News Agency reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The amendments, approved Monday night by the People's Assembly,
will provide for police to be posted outside each polling station
to prevent intimidation of voters and forestall the kind of
violence that shook previous elections in 1995 when around 60
people died. (Egypt-Law Amendment-Elections)

CAIRO -- The Arab League has proposed that the Arab countries
convene a summit in March every year, a senior league official said
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mustafa al-Fiqqi, Arab League assistant secretary general for
Arab affairs told reporters that the proposal to make a regular
March summit the pan-Arab forum's highest authority would be
discussed on May 24 by the foreign ministers of Egypt, Oman, Syria,
Tunisia and Yemen.
</P>
<P>
The five countries form a committee to deal with the issue
concerning the convocation of Arab summits on a regular basis. The
League's 1945 charter does not stipulate the holding of Arab
summits and states that the council of foreign ministers is its
highest body. (Arab League-Summit-Proposal)

<HEADLINE> Russia to Adopt Aggressive Foreign Policy: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Russia's foreign policy under the
leadership of the newly elected President Vladimir Putin will be
more realistic and "aggressive in the good sense of the word,"
said Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The new foreign policy is expected to be active, constructive,
aimed at solving the global problems facing the international
communities," he told Itar-Tass aboard a plane en route home from
Luxembourg, where he attended a meeting of the Russian-European
Union Cooperation Council.
</P>
<P>
"This policy will be aggressive in the sense of the word. It
will be aggressive where the protection of Russia's interests is
concerned," said Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
However, "it will not be aggressive against anyone, it will be
aggressive for the sake of Russia's interests, to protect the
interests of both Russians and the Russian state, " he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Proceeding from the statements that have been made on top
level,the West understands that Russia's foreign policy will not
be cut off from the country's real life," noted Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the West is interested not only in Russia's
foreign policy but also in its domestic developments and the role
Russia will be playing in international affairs," he added.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that Russia does not refuse integration with
international economic and financial institutions but will be
boosting it.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published by the Russian newspaper Izvestia in
its Tuesday issue, the minister also summed up the new concept of
Russia's foreign policy, confirming that it will be marked by "
predictability,consistency and pragmatism."
</P>
<P>
"Our foreign policy priorities are now closer linked with long-
term objectives of the country's development and are commensurate
with the state's real potentials and resources," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
Russia will ensure its reliable security by every means to "
shape favorable external conditions for its development, to
influence world processes toward forming a stable, fair and
democratic world structures," and ensure a worthy place for itself
in the world, he said.

Annan's statement, released at the U.N. headquarters in New
York Tuesday, said it was now the duty of all belligerent military
forces to comply with the decision taken and that they ensure the
security and full freedom of movement of U.N. personnel.
</P>
<P>
The plan was drawn on April 8 with the assistance of U.N.
Mission in DRC (MONUC) which, together with the Joint Military
Commission established by the Lusaka Agreement, will monitor and
verify the disengagement of forces.
</P>
<P>
Annan said MONUC urgently needs specialized military units to
prepare for the deployment of the 5,500 strong monitoring force.
</P>
<P>
The DRC had since August 1998 been confronted by a rebellion
backed by foreign forces and the government of Kabila also
received military support from several African countries. The
relevant parties signed the Lusaka cease-fire agreement in July
1999.

<HEADLINE> FMs Underscore G-77 Summit's Importance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministers of Libya and
Sri Lanka underscored on Tuesday here the importance of the South
Summit of the Group of 77 (G-77).
</P>
<P>
Libyan Foreign Minister Abdel Rhaman Shalgam said the present
meeting of G-77  represents an opportunity for developing nations
to face globalization challenges.
</P>
<P>
He said the meeting has among its main issues the writing of an
Action Plan which will be approved during the State heads'
sessions and released once its evaluation is finished on April 14.
</P>
<P>
Regarding South-South cooperation one of the main separate
paragraphs to be analyzed here, Libya supported a project based on
its exchange experience with African, Asian and Latin American
countries, besides asking a revaluation of a more just
international financial system.
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, after this Summit, it will be necessary to talk
about a brand new G-77, with a most important role to play in
world economy.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, his Sri Lankan counterpart Laksham B.
Kiriella told the press here, that the Summit is a vital need of
the G-77, above all, for its efforts to re-group this organization
's developing members.
</P>
<P>

saying that globalization imposed by the developed world tends to
make this world's section even richer, while poverty increases
among the dispossessed.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's Foreign Minister said that new concentration
mechanisms should be created in order to allow poor nations to
have access the advances in science, technology and knowledge in
general.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Hails Maryland State for Leadership on Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Tuesday criticized Congress for failing to pass a bill on gun-
control.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the United States Congress is paying attention to
this event today, because every child in America deserves the same
protection you have given Maryland children, and only Congress can
do that," Clinton said when he witnessed the signing of a new
Maryland State law hailed by gun control advocates as a model for
other states.
</P>
<P>
Maryland Governor Parris Glendening signed the Responsible Gun
Safety Act of 2000 in Annapolis, capital of the state. On April 3,
the Maryland State legislature passed Glendening's gun safety law
which requires new safety requirements for guns sold in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
"Starting today, Maryland will lead America in ending the
tragedy of handgun violence," Glendening said.
</P>
<P>
The law, regarded as the most far-reaching state gun-safety law
in the United States and a spur to other states considering their
own gun measures, embodies some key elements of Clinton's own gun
proposals.
</P>
<P>
It requires external trigger locks on guns sold in Maryland
beginning on October 1 and requires built-in locking systems after
December 31, 2002.
</P>
<P>
The law also prohibits violent juvenile offenders from owning a
handgun until the age of 30 and requires manufacturers to provide
ballistic
fingerprints of shell casings on new weapons.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the stalled gun bill in Congress, Clinton said
every single day Congress waits, "we lose 12 children, nearly 90
people overall, to gun violence."
</P>
<P>
"Congress should follow Maryland's lead," Clinton added.

<P>
HAVANA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Cuba said Tuesday that developing
countries have proposed a total of 120 projects for cooperation to
improve social services and agriculture among the South nations.
</P>

These projects are designed to improve agriculture, education,

However, currently at issue is how to put money into these

member states thus agreed to conduct study on how to seek
resources and funds available to finance the projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
After they carry out the study, they will know what to do next,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The press conference was held on the sideline of the South

<P>
Cuba is a country which has a long tradition to aid other
developing countries. In Latin America and the Caribbean, 2,685
Cubans are working on developing programs, in addition to 1,389 in
Africa, 249 in Europe and 36 in Asia, providing assistance in
areas ranging from medicine, education, and construction to sports,
hydroelectricity, agriculture and research.
</P>
<P>
From 1965 to 1998, 37,000 scholarship students from 120
countries graduated from Cuban universities, 13,786 with advanced
degrees. Another 7,090 African workers improved their labor
qualifications through training programs on the island.
</P>
<P>
Cuba's most recent assistance program, which has greatest
resonance for Latin America, is in health arena.

<HEADLINE> Colombian President Visits U.S. for Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bill Clinton proposed the emergency aid package for
Colombia earlier this year to help Colombians build security, halt
the production of illegal drugs and the proposal easily sailed
through the House last month but faces a delay in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
Pastrana said that his country will eradicate half of crops of
cocaine or poppy in his country in five years.
</P>
<P>
"I think that if we really want to avoid the growing of these
type of crops or cocaine or poppy in Colombia, we need the money
because we need to invest, not only in the eradication program,
but also investing in the alternative development programs,"
Pastrana said.
</P>
<P>
"That's why you would think that not only would the resources
for promoting alternative development but also the resources to
support the police and the army in the fight against drugs will be
very important for us," he added.
</P>
<P>
Albright renewed the administration's call for rapid action by
the Senate to approve the plan.
</P>
<P>
"Four-fifths of the cocaine entering our country either comes
from Colombia or is transported through it. Most of Colombia's
heroin production also ends up here. Throughout the Americas,
drug-related activities fuel crime and corruption, aggravates
social problems and retard economic progress," she added.
</P>
<P>
Albright also praised the plan by Pastrana. "Only Colombians
can devise a solution for Colombia's ills, and President Pastrana
has put forward a bold plan for doing just that."
</P>
<P>
"It's urgent that we support him not with the promise of help,
but with its reality; not eventually, but now," she said.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana earlier on Tuesday also met White House drug control
chief Barry McCaffrey Pastrana. He will also meet with Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott,R-Miss., on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Pastrana at the White House, McCaffrey urged
Congress to move quickly to pass the emergency assistance proposal.
</P>
<P>
"This is an emergency threat not only to regional security in
Colombia, but also to the United States. This problem kills 52,000
Americans a year. We do think we can turn this around, but we are
calling on Congress to support this plan," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Senate indefinitely postpone votes scheduled by the Senate
Appropriations Committee on a spending package that includes Plan
Colombia.

<P>
Ahern told the Irish parliament that contacts between the two
governments would continue over the next few days in an effort to
overcome obstacles and resurrect home-rule institutions in the
British province, the Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the formula to achieve those aims had not yet
been found.
</P>
<P>
The peace process stalled after Britain restored direct rule to
the province two months ago because it said Irish Republican Army
(IRA) guerrillas had failed to disarm.
</P>
<P>
Mitchel McLaughlin, chairman of the IRA's Sinn Fein political
ally, was pessimistic about the chances of progress by Easter.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. FAA Orders Checks of Bolts on Boeing 737 Tail Mechanism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) has ordered inspections of bolts on some
Boeing 737 aircraft after loose nuts were found on tail assemblies.
</P>
<P>
The directive, which was issued Monday, said improperly
tightened nuts were found on the elevators of the horizontal
stabilizers on 10 of the aircraft that went into service in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The FAA said a nut coming off could lead to loss of control
during takeoff and landing. The inspections must be completed by
May 25.
</P>
<P>
The nuts "had been finger-tightened but had not been properly
torqued" to meet specifications, the FAA said.
</P>
<P>
Since last September, quality control problems, including other
loose nuts and bolts and substandard fasteners, have resulted in
an FAA audit of Boeing and closer scrutiny of suppliers.
</P>
<P>
The latest FAA order covers 737-600s, -700s and -800s.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Commerce Secretary Calls For Granting PNTR to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Commerce Secretary
William Daley again called on Congress Tuesday to grant the
permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) status to China.
</P>
<P>
In a testimony to the Senate Commerce, Science, and
Transportation Committee, Daley said the vote on PNTR "is one of
the most important economic and political issues that I think the
nation will face in not only this year but over the next couple of
years".
</P>
<P>
Describing the U.S.-China trade agreement a "strong win for the
United States" , the secretary said it will present tremendous
opportunities for American businesses and American working men and
women over the next years.
</P>
<P>
Delay, who led Clinton administration's efforts to lobby for
PNTR in Congress, disclosed that this week President Clinton will
release much more detailed information on opportunities that the
agreement will provide for workers in all 50 states.
</P>
<P>
He said that permanent status is required to meet U.S.
obligations to treat all World Trade Organization (WTO) members,
and this vote will not be on whether China joins WTO. "This vote
will determine whether we enjoy the economic benefits created by
China's WTO membership."
</P>
<P>
The vote will not affect whether the Chinese will have access
to the U.S. market, rather it will give U.S. access to the Chinese
market, he said.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Dennis Hastert has announced that the House will
vote on PNTR with China in the week of May 22nd. Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott has also promised a vote in the Senate
immediately after the Memorial Day (May 29) recess.
</P>
<P>
John McCain, Chairman of the committee, said that an important
trade partner with aspirations of increasing influence throughout
the Asia Pacific region, China will remain at the forefront of U.S.
foreign policy discussions for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
"With China's entry into the WTO and implementation of the
terms of the November 1999 trade agreement, the United States
stands to benefit substantially, benefits that will be felt by
industry and American labor alike," he said.
</P>
<P>
McCain said that since the introduction of economic reforms in
1979, China's economy has emerged as one of the fastest growing in
the world.

<HEADLINE> 120 Million Web Users Worldwide Shop Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 120 million of the
estimated 300 million worldwide Internet users have made a
purchase or transaction online, according to a global study
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The study found that, contrary to popular belief, the vast
majority of the shoppers were satisfied with their online
experience and only a minority voiced concerns about fraud and
security issues. Conducted by San Francisco-based market research
firm Angus Reid Group, the study is based on a sample of more than
28,000 Internet users and consumers in 34 countries in December of
1999.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, barely half of shoppers outside the U.S.
and Canada use credit cards, compared with 75 percent in North
America. Cash on deliver and bank drafts are almost as popular as
instant credit card payments in Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Forty percent of all Internet users, about 120 million people
worldwide, have made at least one purchase, the study found. More
than half of all online transactions were made in the U.S. The
typical American online shopper made seven purchases over the past
three months for a total of 828 U.S. dollars, compared to the
global average of less than 500 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The most frequently mentioned use of the Internet in relation
to shopping was gathering information about products and services,
done by 52 percent of Internet users. Forty percent have taken the
plunge and purchased a product or service directly online.
</P>
<P>
The goods most frequently purchased online included books,
computer equipment and software or music, and clothing, according
to the study.

<HEADLINE> Annan Praises Cuba for Achievement in Social Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Tuesday voiced his high evaluation of the Cuban
achievements in education, health and social development, saying
that "Cuba has a lot to share with the other Third World countries.
"
</P>
<P>
Annan, who arrived here overnight to begin his first official
visit to the Caribbean island country as the U.N. chief, made the
statement when meeting teachers and students at the prestigious
Havana University. Annan, who has been in Cuba twice so far, began
his official visit on Tuesday morning, and received a red-carpet
welcome from Cuban President Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
"Cuba may be among the worst smaller nations in terms of the
population and size, but its geography and history have given it a
special place in the global consciousness," he said.
</P>
<P>
Describing Cuba as a country "under a wide range of embargo
for many years," Annan said the impressive Cuban achievements in
education, health and social achievements are one of the two
factors that took him here at the end of his Europe tour. A second
reason for his current visit is to listen to opinions from Third
World countries in preparation for the Millennium Assembly and
Millennium Summit, scheduled for September in the U.N.
Headquarters in New York.
</P>
<P>
Annan kicked off his visit to Cuba before his Wednesday
participation in the South Summit, the largest gathering of heads
of state and government since the founding of the Group of 77 in
1964.
</P>
<P>
The Summit, slated for April 10-14, attracts some 60 heads of
state or government and is also the first summit held by the 133-
nation group, currently chaired by Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Castro, Cuban Speaker Richardo Alarcon and President of the
Havana University Juan Vela are present at the meeting, during
which Annan fielded questions from journalists and students on the
campus.
</P>
<P>
It is Annan's first official visit to Cuba since he became the
U.N. Secretary-General in 1997. The last U.N. chief to visit the
country was Javier Perez de Cuellar in May 1985.
</P>
<P>
Annan left New York for Geneva on April 3 for Geneva, Rome and
Florence before his arrival in Havana. Annan is expected to return
to New York on April 14.

<HEADLINE> Annan Blames South Marginalization on Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
said Tuesday globalization is nothing new, it, as many year ago,
still has dark side although the globalization is quite different
with "profound momentum" and "far greater potential" on the global
scale.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to teachers and students at the famous Havana
University, Annan said, "Globalization is not new. Commerce and
Cultures have crisscrossed the face of our Planet for centuries."
</P>
<P>
"Coke Cola is often mentioned as a primary example of
globalization at work, but the humble potato from the Americas
conquer the global centuries ago," he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan made the remarks after his arrival here overnight before
he received a red-carpet welcome from Cuban leader Fidel Castro,
whose country is host to the current South Summit, the largest
gathering of heads of state and government since the founding of
the Group of 77 (G-77) in 1964.
</P>
<P>
Despite its advantage of increasing "wide choices and new
opportunities" for both individuals and nations worldwide due to
rapid spread of technology and more advanced modern skills,
globalization has its dark side which led to the marginalization
of poor countries in particular, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Only a relatively small number of countries are enjoying
these games. Many millions of people are excluded, left behind in
the corner," he said. "Developing countries in particular face a
range of obstacles to their participation into the global economy:
high tariffs for their goods, crushing debt burdens, and their
poverty on the development, conflict, corruption, disease,
including the AIDS epidemic which has quickly become a global
social crisis, are other formidable constrains."
</P>
<P>
Globalization is one of the four themes to be discussed at the
current South Summit, the first of its kind held by G-77,
currently chaired by Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Annan made the remarks as leaders from the South countries
gathered in Havana to seek the establishment of new and just
international economic order.
</P>
<P>
Annan kicked off his official visit to Cuba before his
Wednesday participation in the South Summit, which is expected to
adopt two final documents to voice the developing countries'
collective viewpoints on globalization, knowledge and technology,
South-South cooperation and North-South relations.
</P>
<P>
G-77 was set up on June 15, 1964 by 77 developing countries in
Geneva. Although the G-77 membership has increased to 133
countries, the original name was retained because of its historic
significance.
</P>
<P>
As the largest Third World condition in the United Nations and
the largest grouping in the South, G-77 is aimed at providing the
means for the developing world to articulate and promote its
collective economic interests and enhance its negotiating capacity
on all major international economic issues in the United Nations
system, and promote economic and technical cooperation among
developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Poverty Is Political Instability Factor: Nigerian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo said Tuesday at this Cuban capital that poverty is a
source of political distress and civil armed conflicts, during a
press conference at the South Summit.
</P>
<P>
Developed countries should cancel foreign debts of Third World
countries, which cannot be demanded to pay but risking the loss of
their democratic govern ability, said the president.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo, whose country heads the Presidency of the Group of 77
(G-77), which is celebrating its first great meeting at Havana,
reminded that wars taking place nowadays in Africa, have a
historical and structural origin.
</P>
<P>
These nations, he said, must not relinquish their claim before
United Nations, the Paris Club, the International Monetary Fund (
IMF), the World Bank (WB), to eliminate such compromises that
affect the economic and social development of peoples.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the Havana meeting, he said that the setting up of
some sort of follow up mechanism for the accords agreed upon is
being discussed here.

<HEADLINE> Capital Spending to Jump in U.S., Canada in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Capital and exploration
spending for oil and gas projects in the United States and Canada
will rise sharply this year, a U.S. trade magazine predicted
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Investment outside the U.S. and Canada will decrease, according
to Houston-based Oil &AMP; Gas Journal, which bases its spending
forecasts on an exclusive annual survey of oil and gas companies.
</P>
<P>
Companies this year plan to raise total U.S. spending to 42.6
billion U.S. dollars from 34.9 billion dollars in 1999, a year of
uncertainty about prices of crude oil and natural gas. The
expected 30 percent spending gain follows a 30 percent decrease
last year.
</P>
<P>
Of the U.S. total, spending for exploration and production will
increase to 26 billion dollars in 2000 from 20 billion dollars in
1999. Expected outlays within that category include 21.4 billion
dollars for drilling-exploration, and 4.1 billion dollars for
production. Spending for non-exploration-and-production activities
in the U.S. -- including refining, marketing, petrochemicals and
pipelines -- will increase to 16.6 billion dollars this year from
14.8 billion dollars in 1999, the journal said.
</P>
<P>
Total capital spending in Canada will increase to 17 billion U.
S. dollars from 14.9 billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Survey responses from 22 U.S. and Canadian-based companies
indicate spending on projects outside the two countries of 15.9
billion dollars, seven percent less than in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Putin To Visit Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 11 (Xinhua)-- Russian President Vladimir Putin
will make an official visit to the United Kingdom on coming Sunday,
a spokesman for Downing Street said.
</P>
<P>
Putin is expected to fly into London late on Sunday night for
talks with Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also confirmed that Britain was "still under
active discussion" with Russia on a possible meeting between Putin
and Queen Elizabeth II.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the visit, the spokesman for Blair said that it would
cement a "new strategic relationship" between the two countries
and added that Putin was expected to return to Moscow on Monday
evening,rather than go on to visit other Western capitals.
</P>
<P>
Putin and Blair first met for informal talks in Putin's home
town of St Petersburg shortly before he was elected president on
March 26.
</P>
<P>
Putin had previously said that he would not be travelling
abroad until he appoints a prime minister, a role he is currently
holding.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to appoint a prime minister after his May 7
inauguration.
</P>
<P>
Russia has faced condemnation from human rights groups in
Britain over its actions in the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Downing Street said that Blair would express his concern about
the situation in Chechnya and press for greater access for
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
"We will express, as we did in St Petersburg, our concerns,"
said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"But equally we believe the best way to express those concerns
is engagement rather than isolation," he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Supports Israeli Pullback on Southern Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak won the support for a planned Israeli troop pull out of
southern Lebanon from the Clinton administration when he held
talks with the U.S. Secretary of State on Tuesday, but he was also
pressed to move fast on the Israeli-Palestinian track in the
Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Albright praised Barak at a news conference for planning to
pull Israeli troops out of southern Lebanon in July under U.N.
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"It is strange that a country is criticized for withdrawing
from another country," Albright said.
</P>
<P>
Albright also pressed Barak to move as fast as possible with
the Palestinians toward a West Bank withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
"This is an issue that needs to be done as rapidly as possible,
" she said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian negotiations are now under way at the
Bolling Air Force Base near Washington, working on an overall
settlement as well as the Israeli further pullback on the West
Bank scheduled for June.
</P>
<P>
Hasan Abdel Rahman, the PLO's representative in Washington
disclosed there was still "no results" about the negotiations. "
Let's hope that will change," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rahman said the Palestinians wanted Clinton to make clear to
Barak when they meet this evening that the negotiations between
Israel and the Palestinians must be concluded successfully by
September 13, a deadline set by the United States, Israel and the
Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Technology Stocks Fall Sharply Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 11 (Xinhua) -- the technology stocks fell
sharply again Tuesday amid the downbeat earnings reports from two
tech companies, thus eliminating all the Nasdaq index's gains for
the year.
</P>
<P>
At the close of session, the technology heavy Nasdaq composite
fell 132.30 at 4,055.90. The index is now lower for the year and
is nearly 20 percent below its record closing high of 5,048.62
set March 10.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Dow Jones industrial
average rose 100.52 at 11,287.08 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index fell 3.87 at 1,500.59.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq index fell in the second consecutive session today
as Biogen, a leading biotechnology company, reported its first-
quarter earnings of 41 cents a share, below expectations of 43
cents. Biogen fell steeply and other biotech firms also tumbled.
</P>
<P>
The broader technology sector declined after Motorola reported
that its second-quarter and full-year 2000 earnings were expected
to fall short of analysts' expectations after a big earnings
increase in the first-quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Dow index rose because investors once again drew out the
technology sector and moved money into blue chip issues. It's a
rotation back to old reliable stocks from high-tech issues.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 1.49 at 661.20. But the American Stock
Exchange index fell 13.17 at 944.87 and the Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 8.53 at 510.13.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,530 up, 1,456 down and 481
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 967.15 million shares from 850.19
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Reno Urges Quick Orderly Return of Cuban Boy to Father </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno Tuesday called for an orderly and quick return of the six-
year-old Cuban boy, Elian Gonzalez, to his father after meeting
two mayors in Miami area.
</P>
<P>
"We all agreed that helping to bring the family together to
work out this orderly transition would be desirable, but I also
stressed that the transfer of Elian to the care of his father must
move forward without delay," Reno said.
</P>
<P>
Reno had a nearly-one-hour meeting with Miami-Dade County Mayor
Alex Penelas and Miami Mayor Joe Carollo.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, Reno issued a statement, stressing that
the meeting was "productive" and she "welcomed their suggestions
on how we can best achieve an orderly reunification of Elian with
his father."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Penelas said that the
family should sit down and figure out "what's in the best
interests of the child," adding that Miami community leaders would
accept whatever the family decides.
</P>
<P>
Penelas noted that the issue should be resolved by the family
and a meeting without outsiders should be arranged. "This is a
family decision. It is best made by them," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Carollo told reporters, Reno told them she
also would be willing to meet with Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's great-
uncle, who is taking care of the boy in Miami.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Tuesday, Reno also met with Gregory Craig, the U.S.
lawyer for the father, to discuss arrangements for the boy's
transfer.
</P>
<P>
The INS has ruled that the boy belongs to his father, but the
boy's relatives in Florida, backed by some anti-Cuba elements,
insisted the boy stay in the United States. Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, the boy's father, came to the U.S. last week to take
custody of the boy.
</P>
<P>
However, Elian, who was rescued on November 25 last year from a
shipwreck after his mother and 11 others died when the boat
capsized in the sea off Florida, was still with the relatives.

<HEADLINE> Annan Begins First Official Visit to Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Anna
Tuesday kicked off his first official visit to Cuba as the U.N.
chief and spoke highly of the Cuban achievements in social
development.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who arrived here overnight and received a red-carpet
welcome from Cuban leader Fidel Castro, said that notwithstanding
the U.S.-imposed embargo for many years, Cuban's achievements are
impressive given its size of gross domestic product per capita.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he also touched on the issue of globalization, one
of the major topics under discussion at the current South Summit,
saying the developing countries face many obstacles to their
participation in the global economy.
</P>
<P>
Annan is the first U.N. Secretary-General to visit Cuba in 15
years. The last U.N. chief to visit the Caribbean country was
Javier Perez de Cuellar in May 1985.
</P>
<P>
The South Summit is the largest gathering of heads of state
and government in the 36-year history of the Group of 77, which
was set up in Geneva by 77 developing countries. The 133-nation
body is the largest Third World coalition in the United Nations to
negotiate for the collective interests of the developing South.
