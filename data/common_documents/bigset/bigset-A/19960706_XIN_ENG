<HEADLINE> Mitterrand's Doctor Sentenced to 4 Months in Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Doctor Claude Gubler, personal doctor
of the late president Francois Mitterrand and author of the book
"The Great Secret," was given four months in jail in suspense
today for violating professional ethics of maintaining secrets.
</P>
<P>
The 17th Chamber of the Correctional Tribunal of Paris today
also announced a fine of 30,000 francs (6,000 U.S. dollars) on
Michel Gonod, Gubler's co-author, and a fine of 60,000 francs
(12,000 dollars) on Olivier Orban, their publisher.
</P>
<P>
"This is another time when the lie of the state has won. This
decision weakens the trade I am doing," said Orban after the
court, presided over by Judge Jean-Yves Monfort, made the
decisions.
</P>
<P>
Gubler himself did not attend today's court session, and the
attorneys defending the three accused have indicated that they
might make appeals.
</P>
<P>
The court said that Gubler was guilty of violating his code of
ethics for maintaining the secret of a confidant, revealing secret
information on the disease, symptoms, medical examinations and
their outcomes, reactions of Mitterrand and surgery interventions,
and having the consciousness of committing a fraudulent action.
</P>
<P>
But the court also said that Gubler wrote the book not out of
"detestable intentions such as making money" but out of a feeling
of confusion as a wounded man would have when he was abandoned in
the field by a friend after a "passionately lived relationship."
</P>
<P>
The court did not specify whether a sick statesman and a common
patient have the same right to maintain secret about their health
situation, and only each patient has the same right to maintain
their medical records secret.
</P>
<P>
Gubler was sued by Danielle Mitterrand, the widow of Francois
Mitterrand, after he published "The Great Secret" soon after the
death of Mitterrand in January this year.
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand had suffered from gland cancer for many years before
he died of the disease. His disease was never officially revealed
until his death.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Quake Causes Little Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- No casualties or relatively extensive
property damage was reported after an earthquake measuring 6.0 on
the Richter Scale hit the Tibet Autonomous Region Wednesday in
southwest China.
</P>
<P>
The quake shook Xaitongmoin County at 14:44 on July 3, with an
epicenter at 29.7 degrees north latitude, 87.8 degrees east
longitude. A 5.1 aftershock hit the county 100 km from Xigaze at
16:01 on the same day.
</P>
<P>
Cracks appeared on houses in Qingtu and Lungsang, near the
epicenter, and landslides covered some sections of the Chag La
District highway.
</P>
<P>
The local seismological bureau does not expect additional
aftershocks in Tibet, and it has advised visitors not to change
their travel plans.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said that quakes often occur in remote mountainous
areas and grasslands, where the death toll and property loss is
usually low.
</P>
<P>
 Frequent seismic activity has been reported in northern
Xaitongmoin County in recent years. The last quake in the area
occurred on May 10, and measured 5.1 on the Richter Scale.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Concerned at Turkish Kurds Camp Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) today voiced concern about the security of a
Turkish Kurd refugee camp in Northern Iraq, urging Turkish
authorities to put an end to recent jet low-level flyings over the
camp.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR spokesperson Ron Redmond stressed at a press briefing
that the Atroush camp was a civilian camp and not a guerrilla base
as was alleged and that his agency did not understand the purpose
of Turkish jets harassing it.
</P>
<P>
According to Redmond, four Turkish jets made several low passes
over the camp Tuesday morning, two of them flying about 150 meters
above head. They dropped during the flight six flares, with two of
them falling in nearby villages and four causing a grass fire at
the edge of the camp.
</P>
<P>
Despite a UNHCR call for Turkish authorities to exercise
restraint following the Tuesday incident, Turkish jets again
screamed over the camp Wednesday and Thursday, at height of less
than 100 meters.
</P>
<P>
The camp, which was set up two years ago, consists of about
3,000 tents, accommodating 14,000 refugees, 3,000 of them children
under five years.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR urged the Turkish authorities to put an end to these
incidents before any serious consequence occurs. Redmond said his
agency also worried about possible mass refugee movements out of
the camp and 14 families had already left.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR spokesperson stressed that the Atroush camp was not a
guerrilla base but ringed by military posts set up by local
authorities. It was five kilometers from the hills and it would be
difficult for people to move in and out of the camp in significant
numbers without being seen, he added.
</P>
<P>
Redmond said the UNHCR was willing to discuss with Turkish
authorities solutions to the current situation, including the
eventual voluntary repatriation of refugees.

HARARE, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African Development
Community (SADC) countries should find a way of working together
constructively to ensure and enhance trade in the region, a
visiting senior World Bank official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after his 40-minute talks with
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe in Harare, World Bank
Vice-president for Africa Callisto Madavo said southern Africa
could be the locomotive to pull the rest of Africa in terms of
trade and development.
</P>
<P>
"Africa faces great development challenges but in these
challenges lie opportunities which Zimbabwe and other southern
African countries could exploit in terms of trade if they can
work together," said the Zimbabwean-born Madavo, who is on a
six-day tour of the country.
</P>
<P>
Madavo said he had briefed Mugabe on his development
discussions with cabinet ministers and his visit to rural areas
as well as the World Bank's programmes of support to Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> US Unemployment Rate Down to Lowest Level in 6 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. unemployment rate fell
to 5.3 percent in June, the lowest level in six years, the U.S.
Labor Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that businesses added 239,000 workers to
their payrolls in June following an even bigger increase of
365,000 in May.
</P>
<P>
It reported that virtually all of the increase in employment
occurred in the country's service industries and construction jobs
rose by 23,000. But manufacturing was weaker with a loss of 7,000
jobs, partly because of the impact of strikes.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate of 5.3 percent in June was the lowest
since it was 5.2 percent in June 1990. The rate remained between
5.4 percent and 5.8 percent in the first five months of this year
with a 5.6 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) decided this week to keep the
short-term interest rates unchanged and to see more data of the
economic situation although the U.S. economy expanded strongly in
the past six months.
</P>
<P>
But many analysts said the latest unemployment report made a
rate hike at their next meeting on August 20 a virtual certainty.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration, which is battling widespread
economic anxiety despite what is now the third-longest peacetime
expansion in history, has argued that rising productivity is
providing room for workers to enjoy higher wages without risking
worsening inflation.
</P>
<P>
But analysts noted that average hourly earnings, which are
closely watched for signs of inflationary pressures, jumped nine
cents in June to 11.82 dollars an hour. It was the biggest
one-month increase in this inflation barometer on record.

<HEADLINE> Japan Welcomes Yeltsin Election Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Japanese government leaders today
hailed the victory of Russian President Boris Yeltsin in
Wednesday's presidential election runoff and hoped the Russian
reform drive will not halt after the race.
</P>
<P>
Japan also hopes that Moscow will make efforts to normalize
relations with Tokyo, Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama,
the top government spokesman, told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The two countries agreed to seek to normalize bilateral ties in
the October 1993 Tokyo Declaration by resolving a territorial
dispute and signing a peace treaty, Kajiyama said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto voiced the hope
that Yeltsin's victory will secure continuation of the country's
reform efforts.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto told reporters that Russia's finance and economy are
important to Japan while its defense and security will have a
bearing on the international community.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Foreign Ministry officials have said a victory for
Yeltsin will mean Japan does not have to change its stance over
its relations with Russia, especially over the long-simmering
territorial row.
</P>
<P>
The 1993 Tokyo Declaration calls for an early solution to the
dispute over four small islands off Japan's northernmost main
island of Hokkaido -- Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan and the Habomai
group of islets.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Press Lauds Mubarak's Role in Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Sudan's independent Akhbar el-Yom
newspaper today lauded Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's role in
bringing leaders of 21 Arab countries together in their first
summit in the past six years.
</P>
<P>
The Arabic language newspaper said that Mubarak is the sole
Arab leader who can assemble the Arab heads of state at such a
pan-Arab summit, which was held in Cairo last month in view of
Israel's hardline Likud Party leader Benjamin Netanyahu's election
as the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
In a lengthy story that covered a whole page, the newspaper
said that the Arab summit would not have been held, had Mubarak
not been there managing to do it.
</P>
<P>
The summit restored the Arab League's prestige, shored up its
mission and reversed the league's theory of "frankness before
reconciliation to reconciliation before frankness," the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to testify that President Mubarak has always spread
the noble demarche for clearing the Arab atmosphere, especially
after the right-wing Likud party assumed power in Israel," it
said.
</P>
<P>
Sudan's relations with Egypt were considerably improved at the
pan-Arab summit, held in Cairo on June 22-23. Mubarak was seen
warmly embracing his Sudanese counterpart Omar el-Bashir at the
Cairo international airport on June 22 before the summit convened.
</P>
<P>
In a related development Thursday, a high-level Egyptian
security delegation ended multilateral talks here with a number of
specialized bodies pertaining to the development of relations
between Egypt and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Egypt had accused Sudan of harboring three terrorists involved
in a thwarted plot to assassinate Mubarak in Addis Ababa in June
1995, and Sudan had categorically denied the charge.

<HEADLINE> World's Five Most Expensive Cities are in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Five of the world's 10 most
expensive cities are in Asia, an international survey on the cost
of living shows.
</P>
<P>
The five most expensive cities in the world are Tokyo, Osaka,
Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong, with Seoul and Singapore ranked
seventh and 10th, according to the survey of 139 cities around the
world by the Geneva-based company Corporate Resources Group (CRG).
</P>
<P>
The only European cities to rank among the top ten are Moscow
in sixth place, followed by the Swiss cities of Geneva and Zurich
taking eighth and ninth place. Europe's least expensive cities are
Vilnius in Lithuania, Limassol in Cyprus and Birmingham, England.
</P>
<P>
The report also included a separate ranking of hotel and
related travel costs. It shows that Hong Kong is the most
expensive city for business travellers, followed by Moscow, Tokyo,
Brussels and Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The dominance of Asian cities in the top ten is partly due to
the high cost of housing which is included for the first time in
the ranking's index, says the report.
</P>
<P>
Housing costs in Beijing are now the most expensive in the
world, followed by Tokyo and Hong Kong. The only non-Asian city to
rank among the top ten for housing is Moscow which has also seen
dramatic increases in prices for good accommodation.
</P>
<P>
The CRG cost of living index is intended for use by governments
and international firms to protect the purchasing power of
personnel sent abroad.
</P>
<P>
The study is based on a basket of over 200 products which
includes food consumed at home, alcohol, tobacco, domestic
supplies and services, home services, personal care, clothing and
footwear, utilities, transport, sport and leisure, home
entertainment, housing, schooling and travel.
</P>
<P>
In the western hemisphere, Sao Paulo in Brazil has become the
most expensive city, followed by Buenos Aires, Argentia, and Rio
de Janeiro, Brazil. The American and Canadian cities compare very
favorably to many European and Asian cities. Mexico City and
Monterrey in Mexico remain among the least expensive cities in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The most expensive cities in Africa are Libreville in Gabon and
Brazzaville in the Congo, taking 31st and 32nd place in the list.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Demands Another Six-Month Extention of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Burundian authority today
submitted to the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) its demand
for a six-month extention of the OAU Observers Mission in Burundi
(OMIB) and for its total strength to be raised from 60 to 118.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Burundian Foreign Minsiter
Venerand Bakevyumusaya admitted the situation at its border with
Rwanda, where Hutu refugees are fighting with the Tutsi-led
authorities, is "very precarious and even explosive".
</P>
<P>
The minister, who is in Yaounde to attend the ongoing OAU 64th
Council of Ministers Meeting, said the current fighting is
raising fears of an all-out civil war in Burundi, where aid
agencies put the death toll last year at about 30 a day.
</P>
<P>
OMIB's current mandate expires on July 15.
</P>
<P>
"That's why our government thinks another six-month extention
of the OMIB is critical to ensure peace and stability in the
country," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, before the opening of the OAU Council of Ministers
Meeting, the regional body is weighing the option of withdrawing
the military component of its mission in Burundi and only
maintain an OAU presence at the political level to monitor
developments and assist when the need arises.
</P>
<P>
OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim, in his report
submitted to the meeting, said the situation in Burundi, where
rebel Hutus have continued a rebel war with Tutsi-led
authorities, "will continue to degenerate year by year."
</P>
<P>
OMIB monitors the activities of the Tutsi-dominated army and
Hutu rebels in Burundi, where UN officials say they fear
bloodletting will break out at a similar scale to Rwanda's 1994
genocide.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bakevyumusaya told Xinhua that the Tutsi-led
government is also working on a power-sharing scheme with the
Hutu majority in a fresh bid for national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
"The government is for a political solution to the political
conflict," said the Tutsi foreign minister. "I'm a realist but
I'm fairly optimistic about the plan."
</P>
<P>
He said the forthcoming talks between the government and
various opposition groups in Tanzania's northern city of Arusha,
which will be presided over by former Tanzanian President
Nyerere, is "crucial" for the current negotiation process.
</P>
<P>
Bakevyumusaya said Burundian President Sylveste
Ntibantunganya, who will be in Yaounde to attend the OAU Summit
scheduled for July 8-10, will make an urgent call for the OAU and
international community to check the potential massive civil war
in his country.
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 people have been killed in Burundi since the
1993 assassination of its first freely-elected Hutu president.
Burundi borders on Rwanda, where up to one million Tutsis and
Hutu moderates were massacred by Hutus in the 1994 genocide.
</P>
<P>
The OAU Council of Ministers is expected to issue a resolution
on Burundi. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Education and scientific knowledge
are vital for the elimination of poverty, and people in the less
developed areas should place priority on learning new skills,
Vice-Premier Li Lanqing said during a tour of north China's Shanxi
Province.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier said that providing farmers with proper
education will help enhance their abilities, which in turn will
promote social development in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
He said that education, especially in poverty-stricken mountain
areas, should be developed from a realistic point of view, and
concentrate on basic agricultural technology.
</P>
<P>
He encouraged young people in government departments to work in
rural areas as teachers, schoolmasters or local township or
village officials.
</P>
<P>
These trained youths then can lead farmers in their efforts to
develop local rural economy, and also learn valuable lessons from
this practical experience.

<P>
During his trip to Shanxi, Li visited businesses, villages and
colleges and universities.

<P>
PARIS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Seven years after a DC-10 aircraft of
the French air company UTA exploded above Niger, a French judge
today flew to Libya to conclude a lingering investigation of the
bombing in which Libya was suspected to be involved.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the daily newspaper Le Monde today,
Judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere, an examining magistrate of Paris, left
for Tripoli with about 15 police officers on board a chartered
plane authorized by the government.

The UTA plane exploded on September 19, 1989 above Niger en
route from the Congolese capital of Brazzaville to Paris, killing

Preliminary investigations showed that the explosion was caused
by a bomb in a trunk placed on board. No one has claimed
responsibility.

Libya is now under strict international trade embargo for its
suspected role in the bombing of the UTA plane and the bombing of
a Pan-Am aircraft above Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Libya denies having played any role in the two bombings.

<HEADLINE> US Considering to Redeploy Troops Around Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S military is
considering plans to move most of the 1,500 American troops
deployed in Riyadh, capital of Saudi Arabia, to a remote
desert air base to reduce their vulnerability to terrorist
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports today quoted U.S. Defense Secretary William
Perry as saying, "It is an urban area, it is the hardest area to
try to gain protection."
</P>
<P>
Perry was telling reporters traveling with him in his tour
after holding two-day discussions with Saudi officials on
investigations into last week's explosion in Dhahran that killed
19 American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States had under the consideration before
the truck bombing -- "moving some of the forces out of Riyadh."
</P>
<P>
Last November, a bomb, left outside a Riyadh facility devoted
to training the Saudi National Guard, killed seven people,
including five Americans.
</P>
<P>
After the bombing, Saudi authorities asked U.S. officials
to consider reducing the American military presence in Riyadh and
moving more forces to a remote air base in al-Kharj, south of
Riyadh, which had been used by the U.S. air force during the Gulf
War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Perry is expected to face harsh questioning next week when he
is scheduled to testify before two senate panels investigating
allegations that the Defense Department was aware of the danger to
American troops in Saudi Arabia, but had failed to take adequate
precautions out of fear of offending the Saudi government.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator
Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, had said that he might
seek Perry's resignation over the issue.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR, IOM Seek 7.6 Million Dollars for CIS Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organization for
Migration (IOM) today urged 7.6 million U.S. dollars for a pilot
program for managing the huge human movement in the former Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
A press release jointly issued by the two agencies said that
the program focused on improving systems and structures concerning
management of displacement and migration in the Russian
Federation, Ukraine and Belarus.
</P>
<P>
Projects will help local authorities and non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) integrate vulnerable and often destitute
refugees, internally displaced, formerly deported people and
people forced to return to their ancestral homelands by conflicts
in other Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries.
</P>
<P>
Many of these people are at present living extremely
precariously in a social and legal vacuum with nowhere to go and
no one to turn to, said the press release.
</P>
<P>
"Since the late 1980s, at least 9 million have moved to, within
or between CIS countries as a result of conflicts, environmental
disasters or a range of fears and complications arising from the
sudden and unprecedented disintegration of a single state -- the
former Soviet Union -- into 15 separate ones," the press release
noted.
</P>
<P>
The money called will fund the improvement and establishment of
reception centers in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, upgrading of
medical facilities, the building of reliable information systems
and personnel training.
</P>
<P>
The appeal, covering a six-month period up to the end of this
year, is the first step by the two agencies to follow up on the
guiding principles and Program of Action endorsed by a conference
on CIS human movement held in Geneva at the end of May.

<HEADLINE> US-Japan Photo Film Talks Likely to Begin Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Negotiators from the United States
and Japan are most likely to begin bilateral talks over a photo
film trade dispute next Wednesday or Thursday, trade sources here
said today.
</P>
<P>
The talks, sought by the United States as the first step to set
in motion the dispute settlement procedure of the Geneva-based
World Trade Organization, would probably be held at expert level
between section chiefs of both governments, they said.
</P>
<P>
Washington filed a complaint with the WTO on June 13, accusing
the Japanese government of "unreasonable practices" that lock out
foreign products from the Japanese consumer photo film and paper
market.
</P>
<P>
At the core of the case is the U.S. firm Eastman Kodak's
assertion that its Japanese rival Fuji Co. has made deals with
distributors that exclude Kodak film from Japanese shelves. For a
year the two companies have been exchanging charges. Fuji
maintains that Kodak has pulled many of the same exclusionary
tricks in the United States.
</P>
<P>
If the bilateral talks under the auspices of the WTO cannot
find a solution in 60 days, an independent WTO panel will be set
up to judge over the case.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President's Six-nation Tour Fruitful, Says Qian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The three European countries, though different in social
systems, ideology and economic development, have all been
attentive and willing to further long-term, stable, friendly and
cooperative ties with China on the basis of mutual respect,
equality and mutual benefit, and non-interference in each other's
internal affairs, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
The three nations in central Asia are newly-independent, whose
close relations with the Chinese people date back more than
2,000 years, mainly through the reknowned "Silk Road," he said.
</P>
<P>
China established diplomatic relations with these countries soon
after their independence and achieved rapid development in friendly
cooperation in many fields, Qian explained.
</P>
<P>
Developing long-term and stable relations with central Asian
countries are an important part of China's good-neighborly and
friendly policies toward its neighboring countries, he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
During Jiang's tour, more than 30 important bilateral documents
were signed, 18 of which were with the three central Asian countries,
Qian said.
</P>
<P>
"These documents further defined the principles and objectives
of developing bilateral relations and open new prospects for
cooperation in many specific fields including economic and trade
relations, jurisdiction and transport," he added.
</P>
<P>
Qian said China and Kyrgyzstan, which have more than 1,000
kilometers of common borders, signed an agreement on border
demarcation, which is of great historic significance.
</P>
<P>
It is yet another important document following the
Sino-Russian and Sino-Kazak agreements on border demarcation and
the accord on strengthening military trust in border areas
between China, and Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrghystan and Tajikistan,
Qian pointed out.

about future relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said, "I am optimistic about the
prospects for the development of Sino-U.S. relations."
</P>
<P>
Qian, who is accompanying President Jiang Zemin on a state

recently.
</P>
<P>
"Not long ago, the two sides reached an agreement on the
protection of intellectual property rights and other
issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Anthony Lake, national security adviser to the U.S. president,
is going to visit China and I will meet with (Secretary of State
Warren) Christopher in Indonesia in July when we attend a meeting
of foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations," Qian noted.
</P>
<P>
"These high-ranking contacts will be conducive to the
improvement of mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
"U.S. leaders have recently delivered separate speeches to
indicate that they attach importance to Sino-U.S. relations. We
have a high regard for these speeches and I am optimistic about the
prospects for the development of the Sino-U.S. relations," said
Qian.
</P>
<P>
China and the United States share common views on many issues
and have common interests. Of course, they also have differences
over several other issues, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe, whatever controversies and differences that may
exist between the two countries, they can be solved in a proper
way so long as both sides stick to the principles of mutual
respect, equal consultation, seeking common ground while reserving
differences, and non-interference in each other's internal
affairs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin is on the last leg of his
six-nation tour which began on June 24.

<HEADLINE> NATO's Post-Cold War Role Must Change: Qian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The nature and role of NATO should
change now that the Cold War is over, in order to conform to
current world trends, Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister
Qian Qichen told journalists here today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led military alliance is a product of the Cold War,
Qian said when answering questions about China's position on
NATO's eastward expansion and the participation of central Asian
countries in NATO's Partnership for Peace program.

<P>
Qian said that the strategic structure of Europe has changed
greatly since the Cold War ended at the beginning of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Different countries hold different views on what kind of new
European security structure should be set up.
</P>
<P>
What action a country takes is its own affair. But for the
peace and stability of Europe and the world, a country should also
take into consideration the security interests and wishes of the
other countries and regions concerned, said Qian, who is
accompanying Chinese President Jiang Zemin on a state visit to
Kazakhstan.

ALMA ATA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Euro-Asian Continental Bridge
(EACB), a rail network linking eastern China with western Europe,
will play a major role in the economic development of Central
Asia, Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said today.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is expected to launch
`Turksat-1C' satellite from a base at French Guyana Monday.
</P>
<P>
The satellite, which has 16 channels, will cover a broader
area, embracing Turkey's links to the West and to Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
Turksat-1C will be replacing its predecessor "Turksat-1A",
which had gone off orbit after it was launched.
</P>
<P>
A ceremony for the launching of the satellite will be held at
the Turksat Base Control Center in Ankara's Golbasi district, and
the launch will be broadcast live on television across the country.
</P>
<P>
The satellite will be monitored from the center at Golbasi
and from the Middle East Technical University control center.
</P>
<P>
The new satellite, more efficient than the previous one,
requires less energy to operate, but covers a broader area. It
will enable telecommunications systems to be assessed more easily
by many people.
</P>
<P>
In addition to improving TV channel reception from Europe
and Asia, the satellite can be used for fax, data and
telex services in banks, airports and hotels, and for radio
transmission, education and diplomatic networks as well as for
national defense purposes.

ALMA ATA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- China today reaffirmed that its
moratorium on nuclear testing will begin in September this year
and said that earlier tests hadn't caused adverse effects on the
environment of central Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin made clear China's stand on nuclear

emphasized that China will suspend its nuclear testing as of
September as promised, Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian

<HEADLINE> 1.3 Million Killed by AIDS/HIV in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Joint United Nations Program on
HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) reported today that HIV/AIDS-associated
illnesses killed 1.3 million people, including 300,000 children
under the age of five, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Of the adults, 600,000 were males and 400,000 females.
</P>
<P>
The UNAIDS expected over 3.1 million new HIV infections to
occur over 1996, or more than 8,500 a day -- 7,500 adults and
1,000 children.
</P>
<P>
The latest data showed that there are now 21.8 million people
living with HIV/AIDS all over the world. About 12.2 million of
them are men, 8.8 million women and 830,000 children.
</P>
<P>
Of these people, women account for about 42 percent and their
share is growing, the UNAIDS said, adding that the majority of
newly infected adults are between 15 and 24 years old.
</P>
<P>
The majority of AIDS cases occur before the age of 35, and over
90 percent of all AIDS deaths occur in people under the age of 50.
</P>
<P>
By June 30, 1996, some 1.4 million cumulative cases of AIDS had
been officially reported, a 19 percent increase over a year
earlier. The UNAIDS put the actual number of cases at over 7.7
million since the epidemic started at the end of the 1970s, taking
into account under-recognition, under-reporting and reporting
delays.
</P>
<P>
Since the epidemic began, around 28 million people have been
infected with HIV, 25.5 million being adults and 2.4 million
children. Of them, an estimated 4.5 million adults and 1.3 million
children have died.
</P>
<P>
According to the UNAIDS, 75 to 85 percent of HIV infections in
adults have been due to unprotected sexual intercourse.
Heterosexual intercourse accounts for more than 70 percent of
total and homosexual (male-male) intercourse for a further 5 to 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
Of all adult HIV infections, transfusion of HIV-infected blood
or blood products accounts for 3 to 5 percent, the sharing of
HIV-infected injection equipment by drug useers for 5 to 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the UNAIDS, mother-to-child transmission accounts
for more than 90 percent of all infections in infants and
children.

UNITED NATIONS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council today reviewed economic sanctions against Iraq and decided
that the sanctions regime remain unchanged, according to diplomats
here.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the council meeting today, Chinese Ambassador Wang
Xuexian said that the Chinese delegation urged Iraq to cooperate
continuously with the United Nations and fully implement the
Security Council resolutions concerned.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Chinese delegation suggested that the
Security Council evaluate the efforts made by Iraqi authorities to
implement the Security Council resolutions and relax the sanctions
against Iraq following the implementation of the resolutions, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We noted with satisfaction that the United Nations and Iraq

disruptions and complete the preparations for the implementing
procedures so as to implement Resolution 986 as soon as possible,"

its obligations under Security Council resolutions, especially
blocking the U.N. Special Commission from inspecting certain
facilities in Baghdad.

"The sanctions regime cannot be changed today. It will not be
changed until Iraq is in overall compliance with all of its
obligations to the council," he said.

Maka said that the government has already put in place

possible adverse effect on them from the political strife
resulted from the adoption of a controversial constitution

The bill bars opposition leader Kenneth Kaunda from attending

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu today failed to create a ministry for a retired hardline
general because at least one cabinet member refused to give up
parts of his power.
</P>
<P>
Ariel Sharon, a war veteran who helped Netanyahu gain victory
in the general elections in May, was promised an offer of minister
in charge of the Infrastructure Ministry, which is yet to be
established.
</P>
<P>
But the refusal to relinquish power at today's cabinet session
forced Netanyahu to delay the issue, saying a deal had not been
completed. The prime minister is expected to leave for a visit to
the U.S. Monday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister David Levy had threatened to resign unless a
senior position for Sharon was created. It is not known
immediately where Levy would allow Netanyahu more time to resolve
the issue.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media reported that Netanyahu failed to convince Deputy
Housing Minister Meir Porush to hand over control to Sharon of two
departments under his ministry.
</P>
<P>
Porush refused Netanyahu's requests to give up the Public Works
Department, which handles road infrastructure and employs more
than 1,000 people, and the Rural Construction Administration that
supervises construction of kibbutzim and small
settlements.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Unemployment Rate Rises in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Canada's unemployment rate reached
10.0 percent in June, the highest level since October 1994,
Statistics Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
A drop in employment of 56,000, coupled with an estimated
36,000 people joining the labor force, pushed the unemployment
rate up 0.6 percentage points from May's 9.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Canada's unemployment rate had been relatively stable since
1994, ranging between 9.2 percent and 9.7 percent, the federal
fact-gathering agency said in today's report.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the job losses in June, employment growth had averaged
19,000 a month since July 1995.
</P>
<P>
The overall decline in employment in June fell
"disproportionately" on youths aged 15 to 24, it added. Youths
shouldered 38 percent of employment losses for the month despite
comprising only 15 percent of the total employed persons.
</P>
<P>
The youth unemployment rate increased 1.2 percentage points in
June and now stands at 16.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Quebec province accounted for 73 percent of the overall drop in
employment of the month, which offset gains made in late 1995 and
early 1996, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Canada's double-digit unemployment rate came at a time when
most analysts have been forecasting a stronger economic
performance in the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The overall increase in the jobless numbers makes it all likely
that the Bank of Canada will cut interest rates slightly to help
spark the economy, analysts here said.

<HEADLINE> OAU Arrears Problem Relieved: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African Unity
(OAU)'s serious arrears problem is being relieved with the
Council of Ministers meeting going on, a spokesman of the
regional body said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is getting better," said Ibrahim Dagash, press
officer of the OAU Secretariat, explaining that the number of OAU
member states under sanctions for serious arrears were reduced to
8 as of today from 13 before the opening of the ongoing 64th
Council of Ministers meeting.
</P>
<P>
They include Cape Verde, Equatorial Guinea, Central African
Republic, Guinea Bissau, Sao Tome and Principe, Gambia, Niger and
Seychelles.
</P>
<P>
Chad, the Comoros, Rwanda, Zaire and Djibouti have paid "a
good amount of contributions" of the OAU membership dues to
enable them to become "good members", he said.
</P>
<P>
Four countries whose economies have been virtually destroyed
by years of civil war, namely Liberia, Sierra Leone, Burundi and
Somali, are enjoying membership due exemptions.
</P>
<P>
Under OAU rules, member states placed under sanctions are not
allowed to speak or vote at OAU meetings until they pay up.
</P>
<P>
The OAU spokesman said this year's arrears of member dues
amounted to 11 million US Dollars out of the 1996 total
contributions of 27 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The OAU spokesman said the member states with heavy arrears
burdens have, during ongoing Council of Ministers meeting,
promised to step up the process of paying.
</P>
<P>
The 32nd OAU summit meeting is expected to be held here from
July 8 to 10, which observers say is the best time for African
countries to show their contributions to the continental body.
</P>
<P>
Some countries have had serious arrears problems for more than
10 years.
</P>
<P>
On question over whether the OAU would take more harsh
measures on the arrears issue, Dagash said: "We are weighing
options."
</P>
<P>
The arrears problem has limited the scope of functions of the
OAU which is eager to expand its roles over a number of regional
issues including peacekeeping and fostering of regional economic
integration.
</P>
<P>
The OAU is considering withdrawal or reduction of its
observers mission in Burundi partly because of the limited
operational fund.
</P>
<P>
In Liberia, the peacekeeping role is largely played by the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
And the first session of the Economic and Social Commission of
the African Economic Community (AEC), a key instrument in the
implementation process of the Abuja treaty which set up the AEC,
has been delayed time and again, mainly due to the lack of fund.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, OAU commended 13 member countries without any
arrears, namely: Algeria, Benin, Botswana, Eritrea, Ethiopia,
Ghana, Lesotho, Mauritius, Namibia, Senegal, Swaziland, South
Africa and Zimbabwe.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Libya Sanctions
Committee today demanded that Libya refrain from further violation
of the Security Council resolution 748, which bans flights between
Libya and other states.
</P>
<P>
The Chairman of the Security Council Committee established
pursuant to resolution 748, known as Libya Sanctions Committee,
said in a statement that the committee considered the fact that
Libyan-registered aircraft flew from Tripoli to Cairo on June 22
and back to Tripoli on June 23. It also noted a press report which
said that the Libyan leader intended to fly from Tripoli to
Algiers in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council imposed sanctions on Libya in March 1992
for failing to surrender two men wanted in the 1988 bombing of Pan
Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 270 people.
The Libyan authorities maintained that the two Libyan suspects were
not involved in the bombing incident.
</P>
<P>
"The committee decided that the flights on 22 and 23 June, in
disregard of Security Council resolution 748 (1992), were serious
violations of the resolution," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The committee demands that Libya refrain from any further
violation, such as referred to in the above mentioned press
accounts" the statement said.
</P>
<P>
If further violation occurs, the committee would consider
recommendations to the Security Council on ways to strengthen
sanctions against Libya, according to the statement.

LONDON, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Sales of new cars in Britain in June
increased for the third successive month, prompting hopes in the
industry of reaching the highest level for six years, according to
figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders
(SMMT).
</P>
<P>
Sales in June were 141,266, 4.7 percent up on the same month
last year. That pushed sales for the first six months of this year
to 1,000,618, five percent better than last year and the first
time more than one million new cars have been sold in the first
half of a year since 1990.
</P>
<P>
The figures are the best news the motor industry has seen since
the boom of the late 1980s when sales peaked at 2.3 million in
1989, prompting optimism among motor industry executives about
prospects for the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
Ernie Thompson, the chief executive of the SMMT, said: +After a
disappointing first quarter, we have now seen three months of
consistent market growth... (that) suggests that a two million
market can be achieved this year.+
</P>
<P>
Imported cars captured 62.2 percent of the market last month,
and 61.7 percent of sales in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Among companies to enjoy big increases in sales were BMW, Audi,
Daewoo, Fiat, Mercedes-Benz, Peugeot, Toyota and Volkswagen. But
both Vauxhall and Rover saw sales slip back.

<HEADLINE> Germany to Withdraw From Satellite Project with France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Germany will withdraw from a
Franco-German joint project to build a military espionage
satellite "Helios II", German defense minister Volker Ruehe said
in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
"I don't really have enough money for this program," said Ruehe
in an interview with the German daily Bild am Sonntag.
</P>
<P>
"We will delay, push aside or cancel a number of (military)
programs. For example, I consider it more important to buy the
NH90 transport helicopters than buy Tiger combat helicopters," he
was quoted today by Agence France Presse as saying.
</P>
<P>
At a Franco-German summit in Baden-Baden in December 1995, the
two countries decided to jointly launch in 10 years "Helios II",
an optic observation satellite to be built in France with 11
billion francs (2.1 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
At the Franco-German summit in Dijon in June 1996, the two
countries said that they would re-examine their common armament
programs in order to save money.
</P>
<P>
But President Jacques Chirac and Chancellor Helmut Kohl said
then that none of the 27 programs under way be cancelled,
especially the "Helios II".
Germany has been cutting its military budget for several years.

</P>
<P>
"We are determined and resolved to preserve this unity that we
have created," the prime minister said in his first public

<P>
"The bitterness of the past will not be repeated and nobody
will hear any more news on discord and disunity in this
government," he said in Kabul's presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, eight people were killed and 26 others injured in

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
announced today a new policy to revolutionize the inspection of
meat and poultry in the country.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the changes would be the most sweeping in the meat
and poultry industry since 1907 when a system of visual, touch and
smell inspection was put in place.
</P>
<P>
He said that as a result of an intense review, the U.S.
Agriculture Department will phase in a new meat and poultry safety
plan over the next several months.
</P>
<P>
The new inspection policy will contain these elements:
</P>
<P>
--Meat packing plants will be challenged to put new safeguards
in place at every stage of production "to make meat as safe as it
can be."
</P>
<P>
--Every slaughterhouse will be required to conduct scientific
tests to detect salmonella and the E. coli bacteria.
</P>
<P>
--Every meat facility will be required to meet high sanitation
standards.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton said that the policy change was resulted from
the fact that scores of people die and thousands become sick every
year through eating contaminated meat.
</P>
<P>
Clinton pointed to an outbreak of food poisoning in the Pacific
Northwest in 1993 when four children died because the meat they
ate was contaminated with the E. coli bacteria.

</P>
<P>
The device, made by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. of Japan,
is a supporting item for the 300,000-ton ethylene project of the
Jilin Chemical Industry Stock Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Styrene is a major synthetic material monomer that is widely
used in agriculture, medicine, as a coating material, and for
accessory ingredients.
</P>
<P>
The project involves an investment of 750 million yuan (about
90 million US dollars), and will be put into production in 1998,
</P>
<P>
By using the existing facilities of the Organic Synthesis
Factory that are operated by the Jilin Chemical Industry Stock
Co. Ltd., the project can adopt production technology provided
by ABB Lummus Global Inc. of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Jiao Haikun, general manager of the Jilin Chemical Industry
Stock Co. Ltd., said at today's contract signing ceremony that the
existing styrene device at the organic synthesis factory has been
in operation for 13 years, and needs to be replaced with an
advanced model.
</P>
<P>
The general manager said that China has long lagged behind in
styrene production and imports a large amount each year to meet
the domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, China will need 1.2 million tons of styrene;
the current national production capacity is only 280,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Should all the styrene production devices under construction be
put into use, production capacity could only reach 700,000 tons,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Bakassi Crisis Leads to Inactivity of Fishing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian fishermen, forced to
inactivity since February, are complaining about decline in
production even if with the return of calm from the dispute
between Nigeria and Coumeroun over Bakassi peninsual.
</P>
<P>
A recent investigation has revealed that some fishermen who
abandoned their settlements and fishing gadgets have not returned
and those who have can not engage in deep sea fishing as was the
case before the crisis.
</P>
<P>
As the Bakassi peninsual has been declared military zone and
not much fishing could be done, Nigerian fishermen appealed to
the federal government and the international community to
expediate action on the crisis so that their only source of
livelihood would be restored.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian and Cameroun have clashed incessantly since 1994 over
the land dispute of the peninsula. It has been announced that
leaders of the two countries will meet and discuss the issue
during the Organization of African Unity summit scheduled for
July 8 to 10 in Yaounde, capital of Cameroun.

<HEADLINE> Premier Li Peng on Inspect Tour of Heilongjiang Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Heilongjiang Province should place
agriculture high on its agenda and continue to contribute to the
national economy, Premier Li Peng said during an inspection tour
of the region.
</P>
<P>
The northernmost province is one of the country's major grain
producing bases, with a yearly output of more than five million
tons.
</P>
<P>
Li visited farms, seed-processing centers, and water irrigation
projects here, and inspected the management of agricultural
machinery and the development of uncultivated land.
</P>
<P>
The premier said the province's vast land space shows great
potential for agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
"If efforts are made to transform low-yielding farmland, raise
per-unit output, and reclaim uncultivated land, then the goal to
increase grain output by 7.5 million tons will be achieved by the
end of this century," Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said it is advantageous to set up family-owned farms within
large state-run farms, providing the state farms do not relinquish
their state-ownership.
</P>
<P>
Intensive farming and the mechanization of farm work should be
encouraged, Li said, adding that efforts also should be made to
diversify economy that will help to readjust the economic
structure.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Heilongjiang, the premier visited large
state-owned enterprises and talked to factory managers, and
listened to their ideas and suggestions for reform of state
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
It is understandable that some-owned enterprises have many
problems when they change to a different management system, Li
said.
</P>
<P>
The cause of these difficulties is complex, he added, and all
social sectors should work jointly to solve these problem.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises should be aware of their competitors and
developments in the market, and maintain easy access to
information, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
He asked factory managers and local officials to study Jiang
Zemin's speech on reform and development of the state-owned
enterprises and to follow its suggestions.
</P>
<P>
While in Heilongjiang, Premier Li Peng also inspected forestry
farms and the Harbin Polytechnical University, and visited workers
in all sectors.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian prime minister
Mahathir Mohamad today urged the Malaysian contingent to have
discipline, dedication and don't give up in the coming Olympic
Games in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Malaysian team at the Pan Pacific Hotel here
today, Mahathir said without the three criteria of "discipline,
dedication and never give up", the Malaysian team's mission to
achieve glory and excellence for themselves and the country would
be a failure.
</P>
<P>
"If we have disipline and dedication and don't give up easily,
we can achieve what we have set out to do. I would like to remind
the team to uphold discipline at all times," Mahathir told the
team.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian contingent, comprising 36 athletes and 28
officials, will take part in eight events in the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"You are there because you want to win and uphold Malaysia's
good name and not to enjoy or see how Atlanta is," the prime
minister said, adding the team should show responsibility and
commitment all the time in the event.

Mahathir also presented the national flag to the team, which

<P>
HARARE, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's opposition United
Parties attributes the country's huge national debt of 60 billion
Zimbabwe Dollars ( 6 billion U.S. Dollars) to the inability of
the ZANU PF government to come up with a forecasted economic
policy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a one-day inter-provincial executive meeting in
Harare on Saturday, United Parties (UP) information and publicity
secretary Isaac Manyemba said the delegates observed that the
economic situation in the country was worsening because the
government officials were corrupt.
</P>
<P>
"It is our view that this is due to the lack of forecasted
economic policy and the measureless corruption that characterises
every government department," Manyemba said.
</P>
<P>
He accused the government of being responsible for the fact
that most services are getting poorer while zimbabweans are the
fourth most highly taxed citizens in the world.
</P>
<P>
"It's either we have a situation where the interests of the
elderly, street children and destitute are taken care of by the state
or remove the high taxation because the government has done nothing
to show for it," Manyemba said.

today with Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat, who
arrived in the Red Sea port city earlier today on a brief visit to

Arafat's visit came ahead of a planned visit to Jordan by

to continue coordination between the two leaders, especially on
the peace process in the Middle East, bilateral relations and Arab
issues.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- European regional conference of
Council of Hellenes Abroad (CHA) opened here today with a call for
unity and coordination amongst Hellenes living abroad in order to
achieve a solution to the Cyprus problem and promote Greek
national issues.
</P>
<P>
In his opening address to the conference, read by Cyprus
Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides, Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides said that overseas Greeks have proved to be one of the
most fervent supporters of Cyprus' struggle for freedom and
justice.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that the presence here of about 77
delegates, representing over 1,000 Greek organizations from
Eastern and Western Europe, proves that the Cyprus problem is "of
primary concern to all Greeks."
</P>
<P>
Briefing the delegates on the Cyprus issue, President Clerides
said that the fact that the Cyprus problem remains unsolved for
nearly 23 years was due to "Turkish intransigence" and the lack of
will on the part of the U.N. Security Council and influential
countries to exercise pressure on Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey sent troops to
invade and take control of the northern third of the island
following a short-lived coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with
Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus president reiterated the government's position for
an overall approach to the Cyprus problem, saying that common
ground between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides must be found
before direct negotiations begin.
</P>
<P>
Clerides welcomed initiatives launched by different countries
in a bid to assist efforts for a solution to the Cyprus problem,
but stressed the need for coordination.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Athens, president of the CHA, stressed at the conference
the need for unity to promote the culture and principles of the
Greek nation and called on overseas Greeks to serve Cyprus and
Greece through "maximum participation and influence in their
respective countries."
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference will set up different committees to
deal with ethnic concerns, education and culture, youth, women's
issues, sport, social issues and Black Sea immigration.
</P>
<P>
Established in December 1995, the CHA is a world body that
unites Hellenes around the globe and acts as an advisory body to
the Greek government.

<P>
YAOUNDE, July 6 (Xinhua) -- African countries will take a
common stance in the forthcoming world food summit to protect
themselves from being further exploited by the unfair
international trade system.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed in the resolution adopted here today by the
ongoing 64th Council of Ministers meeting of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) which is "deeply concerned" over the poor
food security in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"We will make our common voice heard at the summit to defend
our interests and objectives," said the oau resolution.
</P>
<P>
"Africa has the most strategic interest in the deliberations
of the summit and its outcome," said the resolution, believing
the summit provides Africa with a chance to, to a certain degree,
reverse the disadvantaged position.
</P>
<P>
In a world where 800 million people do not have adequate
access to food including 200 million children below the age of
five, Africa is the continent with the most serious problems.
</P>
<P>
"It is the only continent where agricultural production per
capita has been declining over the past 20 years," said the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
Africa is faced this year with an additional 1.2 billion U.S.
Dollar bill for cereal imports, with its cereal stocks having gone
down to four percent below the security threshold, leading to price
increases of 40 to 50 percent, according to a report released by
the world food program.

<HEADLINE> Death of First Professional Female Model in Lebanese Art </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Maryem Khiru, the first
professional female model in Lebanon's art history, has died
with her stories of courage and spirit of sacrifice for the
art.
</P>
<P>
Maryem died two months ago without attracting public
attention, when the country was immersed in sorrow for some 200
victims killed in a 16-day-long Israeli blitz in south Lebanon
in April, a Beirut well-known artist said.
</P>
<P>
"With silence, Maryem left, like that silence with which she
nudely sat in corners of successive studios to expose body
colors to generations of artists for more than half a century,"
Feisal Saltan wrote in a feature story published in today's
supplement of the Lebanese most-circulated An-Nahar daily.
</P>
<P>
The model's stories started with a painting, "the nude
Bedouin girl," produced by Kaisar Jemayel in 1939, and which was
shown to the public for the first time in the second salon of the
Parliamentary Building in central Beirut in the same year.
</P>
<P>
"This painting was only an attempt to retaliate a humiliation
in the cultural life in Beirut, which at a time was described as
anarchic, shameless and impudent," Saltan recalled.
</P>
<P>
"I was hesitant very much before I nudely sat in face of
Kaisar Jemayel, and I was shy at the beginning," Maryem said
several decades later, speaking of her first adventure. "And my
confidence increased when Mrs. Haik, Kaisar's girl friend,
appeared."
</P>
<P>
"My body had not grown completely yet, and I was only 16-year
-old," she added. "After some years Kaisar encouraged me to be a
model for painters and art students in the Lebanese academy, and I
did in 1945."
</P>
<P>
Kaisar died in 1958. "He had often drawn me and told me, Oh
Maryem, you are more and more beautiful and colorful, and you will
enter the history," Maryem said vividly. She became the first
professional model in the Lebanese University's Art Collage after
its establishment in 1965 and worked there until late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The idea of finding for himself a female model came to
Kaisar's mind when he was told on October 18, 1928 the murder of
his teacher Khalil Salib, a professional artist, and his wife
Kari.
</P>
<P>
Police found a painting of nude Kari in Salib's house during
investigations, arousing debates on morality in the tiny republic
under France's mandate at the time.
</P>
<P>
Kaisar had to wait for more than 10 years before carrying out
revenge for the humiliation of his teacher's death and the stern
opinion on the beauty of human body in his orient community.
</P>
<P>
"Kaisar was amazed at my Bedouin face," Maryem said. "And he
hid me under the table or the bed once the door of his studio was
knocked, in fear of any one seeing me."
</P>
<P>
"He gave me one Lebanese pound on every weekend, and I went to
him every day, sitting silently before him from 8 o'clock in the
morning until the evening," she added.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon endorsed its first official regulation on painting in
1966, recognizing the legitimacy of Maryem's job as a model in
the Art Collage of the Lebanese University, the only state-run
university in Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian President Accepts Government's Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
today accepted the resignation of Prime Minister Pavel Lazarenko
and his government but asked it to stay on as a caretaker
government until a new one is formed.
</P>
<P>
The resignation was widely expected following the approval last
week of the republic's first constitution since gaining
independence after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's new constitution, adopted on June 28 after weeks of
fierce debate, demands that a new government be formed within
three months.
</P>
<P>
Under the new constitution the prime minister is appointed by
the president but must be approved by a majority in parliament.
</P>
<P>
President Kuchma issued a decree yesterday appointing Lazarenko
as acting prime minister to head the caretaker cabinet before
parliament decides on a new head of government.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma has made it clear that he wants Lazarenko, a close
political ally, to remain as prime minister and has been holding
meetings with political parties to win their support.
</P>
<P>
Lazarenko, a former farm boss, was appointed prime minister by
the president on May 28 to replace Evegeny Marchuk who was sacked
for failing to ensure a stable and efficient cabinet and carrying
out economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's new constitution replaces a Soviet-era basic law in
force since 1978. It defines the roles of the Ukrainian executive
and legislature, which have frequently been in dispute in a bid to
gain the upper hand.
</P>
<P>
It also keeps the single-chamber parliament and introduces a
new yellow and blue flag and a new national emblem. It sets down
the right to own private property and entrenches Ukrainian as the
only official language in the country of 52 million people.

<HEADLINE> China to Have More Ibises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, July 6 (Xinhua) -- A new way to rescue the rare ibis
from extinction has been found, thanks to artificial incubation
techniques introduced by scientists in north China's Shaanxi
Province.
</P>
<P>
Scientists in Yangxian County have made a breakthrough in their
experiments to artificially hatch ibis eggs and raise the young
birds.
</P>
<P>
The scientists, who work at a rescue center for the rare wild
ibises, remove ibis eggs from their nests, then supervise the
natural hatching process of the eggs and the development of the
nestlings.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, ten young birds have been artificially
hatched from eggs laid by three mother ibises. Scientists noted
that the new ibis moms, who previously produced eggs only once a
year, increased their egg production when they realized that eggs
had been removed from their nests.
</P>
<P>
The ibis was once common in China, Japan, the Korean Peninsula,
and eastern Siberia. However, its number has declined over recent
years, and now only about 100 live in the forests at the foot of
the Qinling Mountains in the Province.
</P>
<P>
The birds are under the top protection of the country.

<HEADLINE> Quadrilateral Transit Trade Deal Signed in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan, China, Kazakhstan and
Kirgyzstan signed a protocol here today on a set of rules and
regulations on transit trade among them.
</P>
<P>
Under the quadrilateral agreement, customs officials will
follow a common set of documents at the entry and exit border
posts of the four countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement basically deals with a standard procedure
relating to the scrutiny of documents at the port of entry,
examination of goods, assessment of goods, loading of cargo and
movement in transit.
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremony, Chairman of Pakistan's National
Highway Authority Shahid Aziz Siddiqui hailed the agreement as
historic, which will help to boost the economy of the four
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said the agreement will encourage businessmen from China,
Kazakhstan and Kirgyzstan to use the deepwater ports in Pakistan
via the northern parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Delegates of the other three countries said they expected the
agreement to go a long way to help strengthen the economic
relations between the four countries on the basis of mutual
benefits.
</P>
<P>
The four countries signed an agreement on transit trade among
them in March last year and the first caravan of vehicles with
transit goods is scheduled to move across the borders by October
this year.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Expects Greater Economic Growth in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is expected to witness a
greater economic growth this year than last year's 2.2 percent, a
World Bank report said here today.
</P>
<P>
If all policies and measures drawn to accelerate economic
development of the country are seen through, the report said, the
consolidation of fiscal stance would be more expansionary this
year than last year.
</P>
<P>
The country's manufacturing, construction and services sectors
would feel "a relative stimulus of the fiscal policy", the report
noted, but warning that economic activity would be hurt "if
movement through the ports does not recover soon".
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's ports are under government reform measures which
observers said would ginger up international trade.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank report saw no increase in petroleum production
of the country this year, a situation it attributed to the lower
allocation for cash calls in the 1996 budget, which is about 400
million U.S. Dollars less than last year.
</P>
<P>
The report identified "banking distress as another serious
concern for 1996". The number of distressed banks has increased
to 60, with "almost 50 percent of total deposit of the system now
held within distressed banks".

<HEADLINE> Israeli Researchers Develop Method On Rheumatoid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 6 (Xinhua) -- A potential method for treating
rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease and other chronic
inflammatory disorders has been developed in an animal study,
according to an announcement of Weizmann Institute of Science.
</P>
<P>
This approach -- described in the current issue of Cytokine
-- may also be used to control excessive weight loss such as
that occurring in cancer, AIDS and tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
The method consists of a new delivery system that provides
the organism with a steady supply of a natural therapeutic
substance. It was developed by Prof. David Wallach of the
weizmann Institute together with Prof. Joseph Kost of Ben-Gurion
University.
</P>
<P>
People with rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune disorders
characterized by chronic inflammation produce increased amounts of
tumor necrosis factor, or TNF. While TNF normally kills diseased
cells and controls inflammation, it can sometimes get out of
hand, causing a variety of illnesses. High levels of TNF are
also responsible for recessive disease-related weight loss.
</P>
<P>
Previous studies have shown that injecting soluble INF
receptors -- free-floating molecules that bind with TNF --
helps relieve the symptoms in human patients because the
receptors absorb TNF. But the benefits are short-lived, as these
receptors are quickly cleared from the body. Attempts to keep
them in the blood longer by modifying them prior to injection
may fail because the organism is likely to perceive the
modified molecules as foreign and develop antibodies against them.
</P>
<P>
In their research on mice suffering from rheumatoid arthritis
and/or excessive weight loss, Wallach and colleagues managed to
maintain a steady level of natural TNF receptors in the blood,
thereby imitating the process that normally occurs in the body
when it tries to ward off the knockout punches of TNF.
</P>
<P>
Mice remained free of symptoms for several weeks after
receiving injections of polymer-coated TNF receptors, while those
that did not receive the injections developed joint swelling,
impaired leg movement or lethal weight loss.
</P>
<P>
In addition to being effective, this method is also
economical because the costly TNF receptors are released gradually
in very small amounts.

<HEADLINE> Study Identifies Hong Kong's Competitiveness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 6 (Xinhua) -- A research study has concluded
that Hong Kong has powerful competitive advantages and a strong
base for its continued economic success.
</P>
<P>
The results of the eight-month long study were presented here
today by the project leader, Professor Michael Enright of the
Harvard Business School, who has carried out studies of
competitiveness in 14 different economies around the world over
the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Professor Enright said that the Hong Kong story is a story of
adaptation, resilience, and real market capitalism. In addition,
Hong Kong is well situated in the heart of the world's most
dynamic economic region.
</P>
<P>
He concluded: "If Hong Kong maintains and exploits its unique
attributes, its economic future ought to be as successful as its
past. I have confidence in Hong Kong's future and its ability to
influence the outcome of many of the uncertainties which it now
faces."
</P>
<P>
The study involved hundreds of interviews and an analysis of
key sectors in the Hong Kong economy. It focused on themes such as
human resources, technology development, cost comparisons,
internal competition and Hong Kong as a location for overseas
firms. The study findings will be compiled into a book to be

<HEADLINE> Italian Tourists Flock To Zanzibar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar is becoming a
popular tourist attraction for Italians with the number of
visitors from this European country shooting up at an
unprecedented pace.
</P>
<P>
The number of Italian tourists visiting the Isles last year
was 8,922 compared with 4,345 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The figure is slightly behind that of Britons who numbered
10,391 last year in terms of trip to Zanzibar, according to
statistics released here today by the Zanzibar Commission for
Tourism (ZCT).
</P>
<P>
Most of the Italians flew directly from Milan on regular
charter flights and came to Zanzibar on package tours. They
stayed in hotels owned by Italian entrepreneurs who had put up
resorts in several parts of Zanzibar, especially on the east
coast and in the north of the Isles.
</P>
<P>
The ZCT said that Zanzibar received a total of 64,145 tourists
last year, against a little more than 40,000 received in the
previous year. The number is expected to shoot up to 70,000
this year.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the isles attracted other foreign tourists from
Germany (4,942), Australia and New Zealand (3,493), Scandinavian
countries (4,804) and Japan (876). There were also tourists from
the Far East, the Gulf states and some African countries, mainly
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The growth of tourism contributes more than 20 percent of the
Zanzibar gross domestic product (GDP). The ratio was less than
five percent in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar plans to attract an annual 120,000 tourists by the
year 2000. More than 60 percent of investments in Zanzibar are
being made in tourism and other sectors related to the industry.

<P>
MADRID, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Cuba's world record holder Javier
Sotomayor ignored a nagging knee injury to win the men's high jump
with a 2.30-meter leap at an international athletics meeting in
Salamanca, Spain on Friday.
</P>
<P>
It was a timely return to winning form for the Cuban who has
been out of sorts lately, losing in the Cuban Cup and in
Lausanne, Switzerland, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
American world record holder Leroy Burrell, who failed to
qualify for the Olympics, won the 100 meters in a slow time of
10.10.
</P>
<P>
Olympic champion Allen Johnson of the United States knocked
over four hurdles in the 110 meters hurdles and finished just
behind German Florian Schwarthoff, who won in 13.23 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Jamaica's James Beckford registered the year's best outdoor
mark with a leap of 8.46 meters in the long jump, helped by a
timely gust of wind.

<HEADLINE> Model of Japanese Space Plane Tested in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- A model of a proposed Japanese
space plane was tested with a perfect landing at the Woomera air
base in northern South Australia state today.
</P>
<P>
Australian Space Office spokesman Graham Stanton said the model
was launched mid-morning today, and data will be recovered to plan
the next test, which will occur in three to four days if weather
permits, according to a press release available here.
</P>
<P>
The test series on the model, which is one-third the size of
Japan's planned reusable HOPE space shuttle, had been originally
due to start last Friday, but was delayed by technical and weather
problems.
</P>
<P>
Today's test, the first of up to 20, involved the model of the
proposed shuttle vehicle being lifted by a helicopter about 1.5
kilometers above the ground, about 2.5 km from the Woomera
airfield.
</P>
<P>
From there it was launched and tracked. Later, satellite and
microwave systems guided it back to the runway where it was landed
by computer.
</P>
<P>
If the tests prove successful, the HOPE shuttle will be used to
ferry cargo between Earth and the world's first permanent space
station, due to be assembled early next century.
</P>
<P>
The Woomera airfield was chosen from among 100 possible sites
around the world for a combination of its remoteness, former role
in space research and usually reliable weather.

<HEADLINE> Iran Welcomes Yeltsin's Re-election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Iran today welcomed the re-election
of Russia's President Boris Yeltsin and expressed the hope that
Moscow would be serious in pursuing an independent foreign policy
free from U.S. pressure.
</P>
<P>
All today's local newspapers carried a message of
congratulation by Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani to
his Russian counterpart.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said: "Your re-election is the confirmation of your
policies by the people who have made a great contribution to the
achievements and experiences of human society."
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that Iran-Russian relations expand
further during the new term of Yeltsin's presidency on the basis
of international law and good neighborliness.
</P>
<P>
Today's English-language daily Tehran Times published an
editorial, calling for bolstered regional cooperation, as well as
maintaining regional peace and security.
</P>
<P>
The editorial further reiterated that Moscow can create a
strong bloc with third world countries in order to safeguard the
interests of member states vis-a-vis unilateral decisions taken by
the U.S. in the international arena.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, Russia should have learned lessons
from its relations with the U.S., it said, adding that the result
of the runoff showed that almost half of Russia's population is
dissatisfied with the Western impact on Russia.
</P>
<P>
It concluded that continuing the reforms will appease those
who voted for him, while putting a distance from the West,
especially the U.S., will expand his popular base at home and
boost Russia's relations with third world countries.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Opposition Demands Repeal of Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Opposition parties are
still trying to repeal the constituion amendment adopted in late
May to bar former president Kennith Kaunda from contesting
presidency.
</P>
<P>
The Times of Zambia newspaper today quoted a joint statement
by heads of opposition parties as saying that the constitution
amendment should be repealed and then be adopted by a constituent
assembly through a national referendum.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement was a result of a meeting held by leaders
of 11 opposition parties in Lusaka on Wednesday. It has been
filed as an appeal with a certificate of urgency in the supreme
court.
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders also insisted that this year's elections
should take place under the 1991 constitution.
</P>
<P>
They also rejected the registration of voters exercise as
carried out by Nikuv, an Israeli company entrusted by the
government, and demanded a re-registration be effected
immediately.
</P>
<P>
The inter-party liaison meeting called for the creation of an
independent electoral commission whose composition should be
acceptable to all political parties.
</P>
<P>
The controversial constitution amendment stipulates that only
indigenous Zambians are qualified to run for the presidency. It
actually deprives Kaunda of right to stand for the general
elections scheduled for later this year as the leader of
the opposition United Independence Party.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda's parents were immigrants from neighboring Malawi
before the independence of the country.

<HEADLINE> Aidid's Militlamen Advance Into Medina, Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 6 (Xinhua) -- At least 17 people were killed
and more than 69 others wounded yesterday when the major two
Somali factions were battling over control of the southwestern
Medina district in the capital city Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Forces loyal to South Mogadishu warlord Mohamed Farah Aidid
have advanced into the district, gaining two square kilometers
from the northern and southern ends of Medina.
</P>
<P>
The district is the largest in Mogadishu with a population of
approximately 200,000, mainly in support of north Mogadishu
strongman Ali Mahdi Mohamed.
</P>
<P>
Both faction leaders have self claimed presidency of the
horn of Africa country.
</P>
<P>
Heavy and small machine guns, 106 mm recoilless rifles, 102 mm
mortars and anti-aircraft missiles were put to use in the
fighting, which still continues.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses, General Aidid has been holding a
siege on Medina in an effort to persuade its inhabitants to
surrender their weapons, an attempt which has never been realized
during the six-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Ali Mahdi Mohamed in Medina are having
difficulty in getting essential drugs for the wounded since
there's no single official hospital in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
More than 170 people are believed to have died and over 400
others wounded in factional fighting since last April. Mogadishu
now seems to be gradually falling into more serious rounds of
warfare.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Liberian Foreign Minister on Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Liberian Foreign Minister H. E.
Sirleaf told Xinhua today that he was "cautiously optimistic"
over the peace prospect of his country, where ceasefire has been
holding following the recent factional fighting.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Thursday, a fresh ceasefire agreement was signed
between General Roosevelt Johnson's Krahan fighters and their
rivals, the "government troops" loyal to two other faction
leaders, Charles Taylor and Alhaji Kromah.
</P>
<P>
"I would say I am cautiously optimistic over the peace
process," said Sirleaf in an interview with xinhua in the
Cameroonian capital of Yaounde, where he is attending the ongoing
64th Council of Ministers meeting of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports from Monrovia say calm has returned to the
capital city of Liberia which was ravaged by the latest round of
street fighting between the "government troops" and their rival
Krahan fighters.
</P>
<P>
Liberia's faction leaders last August signed a general peace
accord in the Nigerian capital of Abuja, a development widely
believed to be a major step forward to bringing last peace to the
west African country torn apart by over six years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
However, the peace prospect shattered when a new round of
fighting and rooting occurred all over again in Monrovia starting
from April 6.
</P>
<P>
Sirleaf said the fresh ceasefire agreement does not contradict
to the Abuja peace accord. "instead, it's part of the
implementation of the Abuja accord," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister also confirmed reports that Johnson has been in
Accra since the latest ministrial meeting of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) held in Accra hosted by
Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings who is also the current ECOWAS
chairman.
</P>
<P>
On the question over whether the general was under "house
detention" by the Ghanaian government, Sirleaf said: "He will be
re-installed," referring to Johnson's dismissal from his post of
agricultural minister by the Council of State, the interim
cabinet in which Taylor and Kromah are vice-chairmen.
</P>
<P>
Sirleaf disclosed that five out of the six members of the
Council of State are now in Monrovia to discuss the situation.
Some of them had left the capital since the fighting broke out.
</P>
<P>
The minister said much would depend on the ECOWAS summit
meeting scheduled for later this month.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS has been maintaining its 10,000-strong peacekeeping
forces in Liberia, known as the ECOMOG, which Sirleaf said are
now "in full control of of the city".
</P>
<P>
On the question over what the Liberian delegation expect from
the OAU summit meeting, he said: "We are seeking moral support
here."
</P>
<P>
The minister disclosed that Wilton Sankawolo, Chairman of
Liberia's Council of State, will arrive in Yaounde at the weekend
to attend the OAU summit scheduled for July 8-10.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Build More Concentrated Industrial Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam will build more concentrated
industrial zones in the coming five years, said Do Quoc Sam, the
country's Minister of Planning and Investment.
</P>
<P>
Eleven industrial zones will be developed in the north with a
total area of 1,690 hectares, the minister was quoted as saying by
the "Vietnam news."
</P>
<P>
Four others are planned for the central region, and seventeen
for the south with a combined area of about 2,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of Export Processing Zones (EPZ) and
industrial zones aims to concentrate industrial production in
areas that are consistent with the development of a master plan,
said Sam.
</P>
<P>
He added that this will reduce the cost of infrastructure
construction, better cope with managing environmental problems,
and create favorable conditions for management work.
</P>
<P>
So far, 17 EPZs and industrial zones in eight cities and
provinces were either granted investment licenses or approved.
</P>
<P>
Seven of the zones received domestic investment for
infrastructure development and another nine were being funded by
joint ventures with foreign partners. Only one was wholly foreign
invested.
</P>
<P>
Sam said that Vietnam will soon examine production, trade and
management in the industrial zones and especially the EPZs, which
emerged in the country in recent years and caused problems in
management control.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese FM Fears More Convulsion in Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz expressed here today his fear of additional "convulsion"
in the Middle East region in light of current deadlock in
the Arab-Israeli peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The peace process is witnessing a kind of cessation and
no one knows how long the peace process will be protracted,"
the foreign minister was quoted by the Beirut most influential
Sawt Al-Watan (Voice of the Nation) Radio as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The way has been lost," he said, "and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is attempting to alter what was
agreed upon in Madrid."
</P>
<P>
Refusing Netanyahu's recent proposal for the resumption of
peace talks without preconditions, the Lebanese government upholds
that the Middle East peace process should be based on the
U.N. Security Council Resolutions 242, 338 and 425, which embody
the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz pointed to an array of recent events, including a
military agreement between Israel and Turkey, convulsive
situations in south Lebanon and security incidents in some Arab
countries, fearing that "the region will witness more
convulsion."
</P>
<P>
He ruled out a quick formation of the multinational
committee to monitor a cease-fire in south Lebanon, which
is provided for by the cease-fire understanding between
Lebanon and the Jewish state on April 26.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the U.S., France, Israel, Syria and
Lebanon suspended their negotiations on the setup of the
cease-fire monitoring committee in Washington on the eve of
the May 29 Israeli general elections in which Netanyahu, leader
of the hardline Likud Party, defeated the Labor Prime
Minister Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon as
suggested by an Israeli newspaper Friday, Boueiz expressed
doubt about the possibility.
</P>
<P>
Israel's only English-language Daily The Jerusalem Post said
that the new Israeli government should consider pullout from
Lebanon after security arrangements are made with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz noted what was suggested was a "treacherous and
provocative partial withdrawal" and Lebanon "will never fall in
this trap."

<P>
ALMA ATA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
visit to Kazakhstan is of historical significance, which will lead
the two countries into the 21st century with a new type of
bilateral relations, Kazakhstan's top diplomat said here today.
</P>
<P>
Kazakh Foreign Minister Kasymzhomart Kemelevich Tokayev made
the remarks at the airport after Jiang ended his visit to
Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan is satisfied with the documents signed
during Jiang's fruitful visit, especially the joint declaration
signed by the two presidents, Tokayev said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the visit, the first ever by a Chinese top leader
to Kazakhstan in history, has yielded tremendous positive results.
</P>
<P>
He said that leaders of the two countries have brought the
bilateral relations to a new stage, which means that Sino-Kazakh
ties will be turned into a constructive and cooperative
partnership at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
Tokayev is pleased with China's understanding of and support
for Kazakhstan's foreign policy and the policy of safeguarding its
sovereignty and territorial integrity.

highly of Jiang's speech at the Kazakh Parliament, saying it has
received positive reactions in the country.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Decides Not to Accept Excess OECD Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 6 (Xinhua) -- South Korea has decided to reject any
unreasonable demand by the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD) for further opening its capital market, the
Finance and Economic Ministry said here today.
</P>
<P>
The OECD, the club of rich countries, is expected to submit to
Seoul a written questionnaire on South Korea's policy on capital
market and conditions for international investment.
</P>
<P>
The questionnaire will be in connection with South Korea's bid
to join the organization of advanced economies.
</P>
<P>
"If the letter asks us to open the capital market over an
unreasonable short period of time, we will emphasize the principle
of phased liberalization of the capital market since hasty
liberalization would lead to market instability and destabilize
the country's macro economy," a ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
The Seoul government, the official said, will make efforts with
the OECD for its entry into the organization by striking home the
South Korean position that Seoul will liberalize the capital
market as soon as the macro economic conditions allow.
</P>
<P>
So far, the OECD has asked South Korea to liberalize the bond
market, allow cash loans and permit friendly mergers.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus,Britain Try to Solve Row over Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus and Britain are seeking a
peaceful settlement of problems that arise from the presence of
two British military bases on the island since 1960, said Cyprus
Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides.
</P>
<P>
The minister was replying to press reports that the Cyprus
government was considering allocating Britain new areas for
British military exercises in Cyprus, according to the local
press today.
</P>
<P>
Michaelides said: "we are in regular contact with British High
Commissioner David Madden and the authorities of the bases for
various issues that arise with a view to deal with them through
dialogue."
</P>
<P>
One of these issues, he added, relates to the military
exercises British troops conduct in the Akamas Peninsula at the
western end of the island.
</P>
<P>
"As far as this issue and other issues are concerned, we are
on good terms and we hope we will be able to find satisfactory
solutions to all of them," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The Akamas Peninsula is one of the "retained sites" Britain
kept for its military purposes when Cyprus gained independence in
1960 after a four-year liberation struggle against the British
colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
British army exercises in this area have often been criticized
by environmentalist groups who say the natural environment was
badly affected by the military manoeuvres.
</P>
<P>
The two British bases of Akrotiri, on the south, and Dhekelia,
on the southeast, cover about three percent of the land area of
the island. British forces in Cyprus comprise about 4,200
servicemen.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Plans to Move Troops to More Easily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 6 (Xinhua)-- The United States is planning to
move its troops from Saudi capital Riyad to a more easily
guarded camp in the kingdom in precaution against terrorist
attacks, according to local press reports here today.
</P>
<P>
A recent truck bomb explosion at the air-base of Dhahran,
eastern Saudi Arabia, killed 19 U.S.servicemen and wounded nearly
400 others of various nationalities.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry, who paid a two-day visit
to Saudi Arabia last week, reportedly said that the United
State was considering plans to move troops out of Riyad to a
desert air base south of the city.
</P>
<P>
The isolated site was believed to be more easily protected
against possible attacks.
</P>
<P>
Perry said that other contingency plans were also under
consideration for the possible movement of American troops in
Saudi Arabia following the truck blast.
</P>
<P>
"We are not planning a reduction of forces. We are not going
to cut and run from Saudi Arabia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last November a bombing in Riyad targeted at the Americans
killed seven persons, including five American nationals.
</P>
<P>
Some 1500 Americans are based in Riyad and about 3500 others
elsewhere in the Kingdom. The Americans are serving at a number
of bases across the country.
</P>
<P>
So far no timetable has been made known for the projected troops
movement.
</P>
<P>
The presence of the U.S. troops in the Gulf region has been
sharply criticized by Islamic fundamentalists who view the
United States as pro-Israeli foe.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Interior Minister
Sheikh Ali Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah has stressed that Saudi
Arabia's security concerns Kuwait and all other gulf countries.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Ali told the local Arabic language daily Al-Watan
(Motherland) in an exclusive interview published here today that
Kuwait strongly refuses any infringement on Saudi Arabia's
security under any condition.
</P>
<P>
"The security of Saudi Arabia is part of the security of Kuwait
and the Gulf as a whole," he said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after the recent truck blast at an American
housing complex in Saudi eastern city of Khobar which killed 19
U.S. servicemen and injured nearly 400 others.
</P>
<P>
He condemned the terrorist acts, affirming Kuwait's rejection
of any foreign interference in the internal affairs of gulf states.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has expressed readiness to cooperate with all countries
to put an end to international terrorism, which he described as
"dangerous and must be confronted with force and firmness," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Security cooperation among the states of the region exists, he
said, stressing that those countries had taken the necessary
measures to fortify their internal fronts so as to "prevent
enemies of the region from penetrating our countries to carry out
whatever they have in mind, namely subversive acts, to undermine
security in the area and spread discords."
</P>
<P>
He indicated without giving names that there were some
countries which were trying to undermine the Gulf security.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's economic
powerhouse, is strengthening cooperation with neighboring
provinces and even with those economically backward ones in the
central and western parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
To promote trans-regional economic cooperation, Shanghai has
provided large amounts of capital, technology and information to
other provinces and regions. The move has not only improved
Shanghai's economic structure, but also boosted the economic
growth of other provinces and regions.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's economic cooperation with others has expanded
from industrial production to other fields such as real estate,
commerce, finance, transportation and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year, the city reached agreements
with other provinces and regions on 18 cooperative projects in
commerce and trade, bringing the total trans-regional projects in
the sector to 236, which are expected to score an annual sales
volume of over three billion yuan this year.
</P>
<P>
The city's automobile industry has designated 66 automobile parts
manufacturers in 13 provinces, with a combined annual output value
of 3.6 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai-Bell Telephone Equipment Manufacturing Company, a
local giant in making telecommunications equipment, has had 28
components producers outside Shanghai, who supply nearly 30
percent of the components used by company.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is providing financial, information and technological
services for other provinces and regions. Last year, businesses
outside Shanghai accounted for more than 70 percent of the city's
stock and foreign exchange transactions, and the city
provided more than 6,000 items of technology, valued at 900
million yuan, for other provinces and regions.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has set up commercial businesses in all parts of the
country except the two provinces of Taiwan and Qinghai and the

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's tin, crude palm oil
(CPO) and rubber markets ended the week mixed with tin price
higher while CPO and rubber prices lower.
</P>
<P>
Tin price on Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) ended higher the
week following strong buying interest. The metal surged 17 sen to
end the week at 15.66 Malaysian ringgit (about 6.26 US dollars)
per kg compared with 15.49 ringgit (about 6.19 dollars) per kg
last week.
</P>
<P>
Total turnover for the week rose to 800 tons from 561 tons
recorded in the previous week.
</P>
<P>
The KLTM's price differential to that of the London Metal
Exchange ended the week at a premium of 35 US dollars per ton.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian rubber market closed the week lower on the
absence of fresh leads and poor market sentiment.
</P>
<P>
August RSS One fell 15 sen to end the week at 339 sen (about
1.35 dollars) per kg while SMR 20 eased one sen to 300 sen (about
1.2 dollars) per kg.
</P>
<P>
During the week, there were some inquiries from China but this
did not help lift the market sentiment. Dealers here attributed
the poor sentiment to a reserve of buyers and their wait-and-see
attitude as most European buyers were still away on long summer
holidays.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian crude palm oil physical market ended the week
easier on liquidation activities due to the absence of fresh
leads.
</P>
<P>
Dealers here said the market sentiment was dampened by news
that Indonesia would reduce its CPO export duty to 14.5 US dollars
per ton in July from 34.72 dollars per ton in June.
</P>
<P>
July South ended the week at 1,070 Ringgit (about 428 dollars)
per ton, 40 ringgit (about 16 dollars) lower from the price
recorded last week.

<HEADLINE> Alleged Share Price Manipulators Acquitted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of Thailand has
upheld the acquittals by two lower courts of investor Song
Watcharasriroj and 11 others on charges of manipulating Bangkok
Bank of Commerce (BBC) share prices nearly four years ago.
</P>
<P>
The historic ruling on Friday closed the book on the first
share manipulation case ever brought by the Thai Securities and
Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
Song, also known as Sia Song, and his co-defendants were
alleged to have colluded to buy BBC shares in October 1992,
causing the price to skyrocket. The Stock Exchange of Thailand
(SET) said 7,000 other investors were misled and joined the buying
spree.
</P>
<P>
Before they were charged in November 1992, Song and the other
defendants held about 45 percent of all BBC shares. But during the
past four years, they sold most of the shares and now hold less
than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Song said he, his relatives and friends had bought BBC shares
with the intention of taking over the bank because he foresaw its
growth potential.
</P>
<P>
About one year after Song's takeover attempts were aborted, the
former BBC executives began to make questionable loans.
</P>
<P>
The BBC now has a total of about 78 billion baht (3.12 billion
US dollars) in bad and doubtful debts.
</P>
<P>
Song and others also face three other charges on share
manipulation filed by SET.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the acquittal, SET President Singh Tangtatswas
said Sia Song has a lot in common with O. J. Simpson. In both
cases the general view was that the evidence for a conviction was
solid, but the court failed to be won over, Singh said.

<P>
HARARE, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Transport and Energy
Minister Simon Moyo has said that the country's horticultural
industry proves the fastest growing of the agricultural sector in
the last 10 years, with an annual growth rate of 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
He told a meeting of the Horticultural Promotion Council in
Harare on Friday that an open-door policy had been adopted in a
bid to solve problems facing farmers who earned one billion
Zimbabwe Dollars (100 million U.S. Dollars) during the 1995/96
season from the European market.
</P>
<P>
He encouraged farmers to report and discuss operational
problems with the cargo carrier Affretair and other departments
of their concern.
</P>
<P>
As the sole shareholder of Affretair, the government is trying
to secure the acquisition of a DC-10 aircraft in time for this
year's peak export season.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: OAU Summit To Focus on Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 6 (Xinhua) -- African leaders gather in Yaounde,
Cameroon, Monday to discuss the issues facing the continent, and
observers here consider that they would focus on Africa's
economic development besides stability.
</P>
<P>
1995 saw the economic growth rate of African states for the
first time surpass its population increase. And this year the
picture is brighter, with fine weather and good prices for primary
commodities. Some predict a five percent growth could be achieved
this year.
</P>
<P>
"Africa has recorded its highest growth in nearly a decade,"
and almost two thirds of the 48 countries in sub-Saharan Africa
grew by more than 3 percent in 1995 with three by 8 percent, and
eight by between 6 and 8 percent, according to a World Bank
report.
</P>
<P>
Regional cooperation has been on the upswing in the past few
years. With the creation of a regional telecommunication network
in 1995, the 16 States of the Economic Community of West Africa
(Ecowas) now enjoy direct telecom links without bypassing Europe
for connection.
</P>
<P>
The Trans-West Africa Highway Network has also been completed
linking by road all the capitals and major commercial centers of
the region.
</P>
<P>
In southern Africa, the 12-member Southern African Development
Community (SADC) has worked out a plan of action, consisting of
some 400 projects which needs 8.5 billion U.S. Dollars. Scores of
projects are being implemented to enhance regional cooperation in
the fields of agriculture, mining, transport and industry.
</P>
<P>
Two agreements signed recently have charted out strategies for
the conservation and utilization of water in the region and
closer coordination in the development of hydro-electric power
resources.
</P>
<P>
On March 14, the three presidents of Kenya, Uganda and
Tanzania signed a pact revitalizing the defunct EAC, opening up a
new chapter in east Africa cooperation.
</P>
<P>
It "will add an impetus to an establishment of a trading bloc
with 70 million people in the market place, which will attract
investment and stimulate industrialization process".
</P>
<P>
The three countries are discussing free trade, and free
movement of people and they reached agreement on the free
convertibility of the currencies of the three countries on July
1.
</P>
<P>
The three countries have expressed interest in incorporating
Rwanda, Burundi, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia into the East
African Cooperation (EAC).
</P>
<P>
It is certain that during the three-day summit, African
leaders would discuss how to expand regional cooperation to
promote economic development in the continent so as to reduce the
risk of being marginalized in face of global economic
liberalization.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: OAU Summit To Focus on Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The challenges are stern as
African leaders have to face the following hard facts:
</P>
<P>
1. From 1975 to 1994, per capita national domestic product of
48 sub-Saharan states had been down by 1 percent in average
annually while the east Asians saw an annual increase of 5.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
2. Debts up and assistance down
</P>
<P>
Debts of sub-Saharan countries in 1995 reached 223 billion US
Dollars, a five percent increase over 1994's, while official
development assistance was down from 16.7 billion U.S. Dollars in
1990 to 15 billion in 1994.
</P>
<P>
3. Africa's share of global manufacturing value added (MVA) --
the yardstick used to measure the manufacturing sector -- has
stagnated. The MVA of Africa was 0.7 percent in 1975 and it just
increased to 0.8 percent in 1994 while the MVA of other
developing countries had risen from 1.6 percent to 5.6 percent
over the same period.
</P>
<P>
4. Refugees in Africa topped 7 million, which is one third of
the refugees in the world, and the number of those displaced in
home countries are three times the figures who were forced to
flee their countries.
</P>
<P>
5. About 22 million people in Africa face the issue of having
food emergency as there are no signs of imminent improvement in
the food supply situation in the current year in sub-Saharan
Africa as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Aggravating the production deficit is a 50 percent rise in the
cost of imported cereals following a 9.5 million tons drop in
cereal output in sub-Saharan Africa compared to 1994, and
</P>
<P>
6. African economies stand to lose around 2.6 billion Dollars
annually with the increasing global liberalization of world
trade, according to U.N. Economic Commission for Africa head
Kinsley Amoako.
</P>
<P>
So the economic situation in Africa remains precarious and
worrying and contrasts sharply with the trends in Asia and Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the adverse impact of political instability,
ethnic conflicts and vagaries of weather, economic performance in
Africa continues to be characterized by low productivity,
inefficient management, failure to diversify from a narrow
production and export base and high vulnerability to the external
economic environment.
</P>
<P>
Most African states rely on a few primary commodities for much
of their exports, followed by beverages and tobacco.
</P>
<P>
Under this situation, African leaders have to put their heads
together and find ways to deal with the continent's economic
problems and socio-political stability so as to put Africans at a
par with the rest of the world.

<P>
BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has decided
to launch an international training center to promote economic
development along the New Euro-Asia Continental Bridge.
</P>
<P>
The training center, to be located in Rizhao City of the
coastal province of Shandong, will aim at promoting development of
human resources for countries and regions along the bridge,
according to a joint decision by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation, the State Science and Technology Commission
and the State Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
The New Euro-Asia Continental Bridge, starting from China in
the east and ending in the Netherlands in the west, links more
than 40 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
China has attached importance to international cooperation on
development of the economic belt along the bridge.
</P>
<P>
An international symposium on the issue was held in Beijing two
months ago, with consensus reached by international organizations
and countries concerned.
</P>
<P>
The training center in Rizhao will provide training service to
technical and management personnel, officials and business persons
from China and other countries who engage in economic development
along the bridge, economic and trade cooperation, and exchanges in
the fields of science, technology and culture. The center will
also work to publicize various kinds of knowledge about the
bridge.

<HEADLINE> India Strives to Increase Tea Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Tea exports from India are
targeted at 600 million US dollars by the year 2000, almost twice
the present level, the Indian Express reported today.
</P>
<P>
A detailed presentation on the efforts towards this end will be
made to Commerce Minister B.B. Ramaiah by the end of the month, a
Commerce Ministry release said.
</P>
<P>
According to the release, Indian tea exports had declined to
about 150 million kilograms in 1993-94 (April-March) from 215
million kilograms in 1991-92.
</P>
<P>
This happened largely due to the collapse of the former Soviet
Union market which used to account for about 48 percent of India's
tea exports.
</P>
<P>
The tea exports target for the current financial year is 180
million kilograms, the release said, adding that the prospect for
the target is good because of the higher tea production this year.

With the issue of new shares, the BBC's registered capital will
increase from the present 13 billion baht (520 million US dollars)
to 33 billion baht (1.32 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at helping the Central Bank rescue the BBC at
the lowest cost, according to BBC caretaker governor Rerngchai
Maraganond.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the BBC will issue convertible debentures to the
tune of 25 billion baht (1 billion dollars), with a coupon price
of 10,000 baht (400 US dollars) and a maturity period of five
years.
</P>

group to buy the debentures.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that as of May the BBC had bad and doubtful
debts to the tune of 78 billion baht (3.12 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Half of the sum was said to have been extended to politicians
on overvalued land as collateral, and the other half to BBC former
president Krirkkiat Jalichandra's own companies.
</P>
<P>

STOCKHOLM, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Frankie Fredericks of Namibia
beat American world record holder Michael Johnson on Friday to win
the men's 200 meters final at the Bislett Games in Oslo of Norway,
snapping the American's winning streak of 21 races.
</P>
<P>
Fredericks, missed the world 100-meter record by just 0.01
Wednesday in Lausanne, Switzerland, clocked a winning time of
19.82 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who set a world 200-meter record of 19.66 in the
U.S. Olympic Trials 12 days ago, was three hundredths of a second
behind on a chilly and rainy night at Bislett Stadium.
</P>
<P>
"I had nothing to lose," said Fredericks, who has broken three
African and Commonwealth records in 11 days. "I knew I could come
in here and get second and they would say: `well, we expected
that.'
</P>
<P>
"I had really no pressure. I knew that I'm going to run well if
I get a good start and that's what I did."
</P>
<P>
Johnson, meanwhile, had a terrible start.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody has their bad day," he said. "This was mine. I hate
to lose. When you give Frankie a lot of meters at the start you
have to lose."
</P>
<P>
Jeff Williams, another American, was third in 20.44 followed by
countrymen Alvis Whitted in 20.50 and Kevin Little in 20.57.

<HEADLINE> Swedish Researchers Identify Common Cancer Gene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Swedish researchers have
discovered a gene responsible for the most common form of cancer,
a skin cancer called basal cell carcinoma.
</P>
<P>
Professor Rune Toftgaard, of the Novum Center for Nutrition and
Toxicology at the Karolinska Hospital in Stockholm, said today
that the gene is crucial for basal cell carcinoma of the skin.
</P>
<P>
Basal cell cancer, a benign form of cancer caused by sun
exposure, affects 200 people per 100,000 in Sweden, but up to
1,000 per 100,000 in sun-exposed countries such as Australia.
</P>
<P>
The identified gene, in the category of so-called tumor
supressor gene, is able to prevent unchecked cell growth. If it
fails, tumor growth is not prevented and a tumor can develop.
</P>
<P>
Toftgaard said further research will focus on using medication
to substitute the suppressor gene's function, as a means to treat
the skin cancer.

The bomb explosion set off by a woman suicide bomber belonging
to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in the heart of
Jaffna city Thursday left 23 people dead and over 60 wounded.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the attack is a subtle attempt to retard the
governments' rehabilitation plan in the city.
</P>
<P>
But the government is never frightened and the attempt is
doomed to failure, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said a heavily bandaged Housing Minister N.S. De
Silva, who was injured in the explosion, said at the Colombo
National Hospital last night that he saw the brutal act of the
LTTE, but he hoped to go back soon to the north for the
rehabilitation plan on Jaffna Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting against the government for a
separate Tamil state in the north and east of the country since
1983. More than 50,000 people have been killed in the ethnic war.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Threatens Street Agitation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The opposition Bangladesh Nationalist
Party (BNP) has threatened street agitation "if repression on the
party activities continued."
</P>
<P>
Talking to newsmen after swearing-in as a member of parliament
Friday, BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia alleged that "our offices have
been ransacked and our party leaders and activists harassed. If
this situation continues, we'll be compelled to take to the
street."
</P>
<P>
The BNP, the ruling party in 1991-1996, was defeated by its
arch rival the Awami League (AL) in the June 12 parliamentary
elections. The AL won 146 of the 300 parliamentary seats while the
BNP bagged 116 seats.
But Khaleda ruled out any possibility for the BNP to join the AL
government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.
</P>
<P>
About the alleged rigging and irregularities in the election,
the BNP leader said that her party had already taken recourse to
legal steps seeking redress in the regard, and planned to form a
shadow cabinet in the parliament to make parliamentary democracy
more effective.
</P>
<P>
"We have struggled for democracy and restored parliamentary
democracy. So, whatever responsibilities we have been given, we
will perform those properly and sincerely," Khaleda added.

<HEADLINE> Visitors Greeted by Beagles at Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Olympic athletes and visitors are
greeted by sniffing beagles as they arrive at Atlanta's Hartsfield
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
Hartsfield, like other 17 American airports, uses beagles to
help detect contraband that visitors bring into the country.
</P>
<P>
Leader, a 3-year-old beagle, and its partner Peppa, an
eight-year-old, are members of the Beagle Brigade, a unit of the
U.S. Department of Agriculture's Plant Protection and Quarantine
inspection team. They sniff for fruit, plants and meat that could
bring disease-causing bacteria and insects into the country by way
of international passengers' luggage.
</P>
<P>
If a bag has contraband, Leader or Peppa, with a pawing motion
or a stop next to the suspicious bag, alerts canine officer Steve
Manwaring.
</P>
<P>
On an average day, Leader and Peppa sniff from 1,500 to 2,000
bags. They work for about five hours and have a 90 percent of
accuracy. Once detected to have contraband, the visitor can be
fined up to 250 dollars.
</P>
<P>
One of Leader's biggest discovery was 80 pounds of salami
sandwiches in the suitcases of a Russian dance troupe visiting
Atlanta six months ago.
</P>
<P>
"These dogs can search about 200 bags in five to 10 minutes,"
said Manwaring. "They are a real tool. It saves a lot of time from
inspectors searching individual bags."
</P>
<P>
Three more beagles are due to join Leader and Peppa this month,
in time for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Manwaring said the beagles are donated by animal shelters and
private owners and they are trained at centers in New York, San
Francisco and Miami for 12 weeks.
</P>
<P>
It costs 2,000 dollars to train a dog, the canine officer
added.

<HEADLINE> Italy Moves Closer to Single Currency With Lower Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Italy's month-on-month inflation has
eased to 3.9 percent in June -- below 4 percent for the first time
in 18 months, paving the way for the new Italian Prime Minister
Romano Prodi's push toward a single European currency.
</P>
<P>
Figures from Italy's national statistics bureau Istat showed
the fall from an inflation rate of 4.3 percent in May. And
economist said Prodi would be able to tame inflation to 3.5
percent this year and still lower to 2.5 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Prodi, a respected economist and former chairman of a giant
state holding company IRI, aimed to tame inflation to help bring
down interest rates and put Italy in a position to join a single
European currency in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Italy was widely expected to cut half a percentage
point of the discount rate -- a key bank lending rate which is now
9 percent -- if inflation falls to four percent.
</P>
<P>
But Italy's road to a single currency was far from smooth as
the European statistics bureau Eurostat said earlier this week
that Italy's year-on-year inflation rate -- though dropping from
5.4 percent to 4.4 percent -- was still not low enough to satisfy
the single currency requirements.
</P>
<P>
The currency standards require the inflationary targets for the
15 EU member states to be 1.5 percent above the average inflation
rate of the three countries with the lowest rate of price
increases.
</P>
<P>
From May 1995 to May 1996, the average rate of inflation for
the European Union as a whole had dropped from 3.1 percent to 2.7
percent, the Eurostat said.
</P>
<P>
Eleven EU countries presently satisfied the requirements but
Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece still lagged behind.

BANGKOK, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Mexico is interested in becoming
the first Latin American country to form a "sectoral dialogue
partnership" with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) in a bid to develop relations with the grouping.
</P>
<P>
Mexican Foreign Minister Jose Angel Gurria, who is on a
three-day visit to Thailand as part of his Southeast Asian trip,
told his Thai counterpart Amnuay Virawan Friday that Mexico is
seeking to be "a sectoral dialogue partner" with ASEAN as a first
step to closer ties between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Gurria said his country was keen on cooperating with ASEAN in
various sectors, such as energy, automobile parts, cement,
construction and machinery.
</P>
<P>
A sectoral dialogue partner cooperates with ASEAN in some
specific sectors such as trade, investment and tourism, while
being a full dialogue partner could cover political and economic
issues.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, Amnuay reaffirmed the establishment of
links between the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) and the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to promote trade and
investment between the two zones in the future.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Gurria Friday, Thai Commerce Minister
Chucheep Harnsawat asked Mexico to allow imports of Thai rice
without waiting for a guarantee from the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) that Thai rice does not contain fungi as
suggested by complaints from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Gurria had visited Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore before
coming to Thailand on Thursday. He is leaving Thailand for Japan
later today.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Continues Investigations Into Ramirez Drug Empire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian prosecution
continues investigations into the alleged drug trafficker Luis
Enrique Ramirez as investigators searched the properties of the
drug boss across the nation in a bid to break his financial
network and identify his front men.
</P>
<P>
Investigators made at least 30 searchs in the past two days in
several cities, where Ramirez, nicknamed "Mickey," has businesses
and properties that are apparently used as a facade for his
illegal drug business.
</P>
<P>
Among the pieces of real estate searched is the famous
restaurant "El Buque," north of Santafe de Bogota. The boss of
the restaurant, Jean Ibrain Feghali, was charged with being one of
the kingpins of the Coast drug cartel.
</P>
<P>
Police also found that Ramirez owned many expensive weapons of
different calibers, which experts say are hard to get in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Ramirez was captured two weeks ago in a luxurious apartment
north of the capital and remains in the La Modelo Jail in Santafe
de Bogota.
</P>
<P>
Investigators ordered the detention without bail for Ramirez,
indicted for drug trafficking and conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
Under Director General of National Police Luis Enrique
Montenegro Rincon said that Ramirez was operating a drug
trafficking route between Colombia and Mexico.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Instant Coffee Exports Up, But Income Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's instant coffee export
increased in the first half of the year, but export earnings
slipped, the Brazilian Instant Coffee Industry Association (ABCS)
said today.
</P>
<P>
Some 28,000 tons of instant coffee was exported during the
first half of the year, up 5.4 percent over the same period of
last year.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, export income totaled 207.3 million U.S. dollars,
28 percent less than expected.
</P>
<P>
ABCS blamed the drop on the high price of green coffee, the raw
material for producing instant coffee, in the domestic
market.

<HEADLINE> Panama to Reopen Talks on U.S. Bases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Panamanian Foreign Minister
Ricardo Alberto Arias said today that his country will resume the
talks with the United States on the extension of the U.S. military
bases beyond the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Arias told the press that the talks will reopen after the
Panamanian government concludes its consultations with the
political parties to reach a consensus on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The consultations, to be started today with the Arnulfista
opposition party, aim at finding a "national position" on the
matter, added Arias.
</P>
<P>
But Arias said that it will be difficult to adopt a national
position because of the different opinions Panamanians have on
this matter.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said he is exhorting all political and
social sectors to find a consensus on the "national position" of
Panama.
</P>
<P>
Arias declared that a popular consultation would be convoked
"only after Panama reaches an agreement with the United States in
the talks."
</P>
<P>
The United States has 10 military bases and 7,500 troops in
Panama. According to the Torrijos-Carter agreements signed in
1977 between the two countries, the U.S. military bases must
transfer to the Panamanian sovereignty by December 31, 1999, and
all U.S. servicemen will have to leave the Panamanian territory.
</P>
<P>
A few months ago, Panama and the United States began to discuss
the possibility of extending the U.S. military bases in the
Panamanian territory beyond 2000.
</P>
<P>
The talks were postponed when the United States warned that it
would not pay anything for staying in Panama.

<HEADLINE> Americans Concern About commercialism and Professionalism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Most of the Americans complain that
too much commercialism and professionalism in the Olympic Games,
according to a recent survey.
</P>
<P>
A large percentage -- 67 percent -- complains that there are
too many commercials on the broadcast although they won't be
frustrated to the point of changing the channel, shows the survey
of 1,002 Americans conducted by Marketing Research Services Inc.
</P>
<P>
Isaac Pitts, a counselor in New Jersy who was among those
surveyed, think the Games have been tainted by commercialism.
</P>
<P>
"It seems that all the athletes are getting paid to wear
somebody's logo," he said. "That takes away from what the Olympics
really represent. You want the athletes to represent your country,
not represent some company."
</P>
<P>
Dick Schultz, executive director of the U.S. Olympic Committee,
said that it wasn't easy for Olympic officials to strike a balance
between protecting the integrity of the Games and selling out to
corporate sponsors.
</P>
<P>
"To keep something like the Olympic Games on track, it's always
a little precarious. You walk a fine line and the ledge gets
pretty narrow and you can fall off quite easily," Schultz
said. "We've reached that fine line from a commercial standpoint.
You run the risk of overcommercializing to the point they become a
big commercial product and they lose their impact."
</P>
<P>
The public is nearly divided in the professionalism, with
slightly more Americans against participation by pro athletes, the
survey shows.
</P>
<P>
Fifty percent said professionals shouldn't be allowed to
compete, while 47 percent said they should.
</P>
<P>
Much of the public believe that the Olympics risks being
overshadowed by the all-star pros in basketball and tennis.
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather they be all amateurs," said Rick France, who was
also among the those surveyed. "I miss the days when people did it
just for the fun, for the love the of the game."

<HEADLINE> WTO Urged to Disjoin Human Rights with Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Medium-sized countries are urging
bigger members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) not to link
trade with the issues like human rights, labor rights, or
investment policy.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Viravan made this remark
carried on today's local newspapers on his return to Bangkok after
attending a meeting of representatives of 16 medium-sized
countries in Switzerland earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
These countries called for some bigger WTO members to stop
applying "unilateral" action, Amnuay said, indicating it will
destroy the world trade system.
</P>
<P>
The Thai deputy prime minister said that the countries also
have proposed discussions on the issue during the forthcoming
meeting of WTO ministers in Singapore this December.
</P>
<P>
The discussions must take the form of consultations and not
negotiations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Guidelines should be set at the Singapore meeting, but they
should have no legal binding, Amnuay noted.
</P>
<P>
Compromise is needed when discussions involving specific
standards already applied by some WTO members are linked with
trade, he added.
</P>
<P>
Expressing optimism that negotiations in some sectors like
telecommunications and maritime transportation would be concluded
soon, Amnuay said that US complaints are holding up the talks.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Military Says Metal Fatigue Causes Chopper Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese Maritime Self-Defense
Force (MSDF) said Friday that metal fatigue in parts around the
rotor was the cause of a helicopter accident last month during a
joint military training drill around Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
Six people were slightly injured when an SH-60J MSDF helicopter
caught fire at the Barbers Point base on the Hawaiian island of
Oahu on June 18.
</P>
<P>
The chopper was taking part in an international joint military
exercise dubbed RIMPAC in the Pacific. The RIMPAC, for rim of the
Pacific, were launched in 1971 and are held every two years in
waters off the Hawaiian Islands.
</P>
<P>
The MSDF said metal fatigue in the parts caused the rotor to
spin off, forcing the chopper to lose control and setting fire to
its fuel supply.
</P>
<P>
The MSDF has suspended operation of some 56 SH-60J helicopters
since the accident. But they will be put into operation again
after technicians examine the metal parts in question.
</P>
<P>
Also during the six-nation naval maneuvers, participated by
troops from Japan, the United States, Australia, Canada, South
Korea and Chile, a Japanese destroyer mistakenly shot down an
American A-6E Intruder attack bomber.
</P>
<P>
The two pilots in the plane were rescued and suffered only
minor injuries.

<HEADLINE> Japan Warned of Poor Anti-Dioxin Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Greenpeace warned Japan on Friday
that the country's anti-dioxin policy is far behind those of other
countries.
</P>
<P>
The international environmentalists group is campaigning in
Japan to warn local residents of the danger of the chemical
compound and to call on the Japanese government to order a stop to
the production and use of the products which can generate dioxin.
</P>
<P>
Dioxin was a key element in the gas of Agent Orange the United
States used during the Vietnam War. The defoliant has been known
to cause cancer and deformities.
</P>
<P>
Dioxin can be easily produced by merely burning plastic
products. Officials said the Japanese health and welfare ministry
was alarmed by reports that high levels of the toxic chemical have
been detected in the air and soil near garbage incinerators in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from a governmental anti-pollution committee
detected dioxin and other poisonous chemical products at sites of
industrial wastes at levels higher than allowed when they
conducted research last year.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the health and welfare ministry announced it would
review the existing guidelines for combating dioxin for the first
time in five years.

<HEADLINE> China to Use 3.5 Billion Dollars in Chemical Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- China expects to use 3.5 billion
US dollars of overseas funds in its chemical industry in the
next five years, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
The industry has to open itself to overseas investors as its
development needs both overseas funds and technology, said Vice
Minister of Chemical Industry He Guoqiang.
</P>
<P>
Overseas chemical producers can participate in the development
of China's chemical industry by applying their advantages in
capital and technology, and open a vast market for themselves, he
said.
</P>
<P>
During the past 17 years, China has used 6.5 billion
U.S. dollars of overseas funds in the chemical industry, with
5,500 joint ventures established.
</P>
<P>
A number of large projects have been completed to help increase
production of chemical fertilizers, rubber products, ethylene,
synthesized materials and fine chemical products.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China's foreign trade in chemical products amounted
to 29.7 billion U.S. dollars, with exports totaling 11.6 billion
U.S. dollars and imports totaling 18.1 billion U.S. dollars.

<P>
HEFEI, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have developed a
system which can monitor fire and burglary simultaneously in a
building with an area of several hundred square meters.
</P>
<P>
The system, which can automatically distinguish a burning
cigarette butt, and detect the slightest motion of an object in a
room with an area of several hundred sq m, was developed by
professors Fan Weicheng and Wang Qing'an and others at the Chinese
University of Science and Technology in Hefei, capital of east
China's Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
The system consists of a sub-system for the early probing and
pinpointing of the location of fires, an automatic fire
extinguishing system and a sub-system recording fires and
burglaries. It also has common monitoring functions.
</P>
<P>
Electronic information and integration technology is used as

<HEADLINE> Graf, Sanchez to Vie for Wimbledon Women's Singles Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WIMBLEDON, ENGLAND, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion
Steffi Graf of Germany and her Spanish arch-rival Arantxa Sanchez
have eventually overcome their last hurdle and entered their
Wimbledon final, re-play of the 1995 Wimbledon women's singles
final.
</P>
<P>
World number one Graf has met with fierce opposition from the
12th-seeded Dimiko Date, who started slowly in all her matches at
the Wimbledon tournament.
</P>
<P>
During the first two set played on Thursday, Date, lost her
first set 2-6, launched powerful comeback upon her arch-rival and
grabbed the second set by the same 6-2.
</P>
<P>
When the Japanese player seemed totally dominated the Wimbledon
Center Court and forced the defending champion on the defensive,
the matches were suspended due to the falling of dusk.
</P>
<P>
At the crucial third set played early this morning, Graf, fully
recovered from her disadvantageous situation on Thursday,
overpowered the diminutive Japanese player and won the third set
6-3.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the match, Graf paid tribute to her tough
opponent Date, "Dimiko could not have played better tennis. It was
difficult for me to do anything."
</P>
<P>
"But at 2-2 in the third set, I was serving better than
Thursday and that made me feel better. I was a little lucky at
certain times but I played the important points pretty well," Graf
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kimiko Date admitted she would have preferred to
have continued playing on Thursday evening after wresting the
initiative from Graf.
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to finish the game on Thursday. I could have kept the
momentum going. My eyesight is very good and the fading light
didn't bother me at all," Date said.
</P>
<P>
"I knew I had to play my best as she is top player in the
world. It would have been difficult to beat her. I think she is
favorite to win the Wimbledon title," she added.
</P>
<P>
Sanchez Vicario cruised comfortably into the final Thursday by
beating Meredith McGrath 6-2, 6-1 in 61 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Graf aims for her seventh title at Wimbledon when she takes
Sanchez-Vicario on Saturday's women's singles final clash. Victory
for the German ace would also mark her 20th Grand Slam titles and
her 100th tournament triumph.
</P>
<P>
Graf defeated the fourth seeded Spanish player to win the
French Open last month. Sanchez-Vicario is the last person to beat
Graf in in a Grand Slam final -- at the 1994 U.S. Open Final.
</P>
<P>
Sanchez-Vicario has had a relatively easy passage through to
Saturday's final showdown. The Spanish ace will meet a seed for
the first time when she faces defending champion Graf.
</P>
<P>
The 1995 runner-up has only dropped one set en route was in top
form when she out-served, out-returned and out-ran Meredith
McGrath in her semi-final.
</P>
<P>
She and Graf will be meeting for the 36th time, with Graf
leading 27 win to eighth.

<HEADLINE> Upward Trend of EU's Hard Coal Imports Maintained in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The upward trend of hard coal
imports into the European Union (EU) recorded in 1994 was
maintained in 1995, showing a rise of 5.4 million metric tons.
</P>
<P>
According to a Statistical Office of the Euorpean Communities
(EUROSTAT) report issued in Luxembourg today, the imports rose
from 131 million tons in 1994 to 136.4 million tons in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Among EU nations, the biggest import increase, 19 percent, or 3
million tons, was recorded in Italy, while the largest decrease,
17.6 percent, or 2.1 million tons, was reported by France.
</P>
<P>
In the coal producing countries, the import increase varied
between 0.8 million tons for Germany and 1 million tons for Spain.
</P>
<P>
The rise in imports is directly related to the increased demand
for hard coal from power stations.
</P>
<P>
The United States was the EU's major supplier of hard coal in
1995 with 38 million tons, leaving South Africa at the second
place with 30.2 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The two countries increased their exports in 1995 to the EU by
10 million tons and 2.7 million tons respectively in comparison
with 1994.

<HEADLINE> Enterprise Groups Play Important Role in Inner Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, July 6 (Xinhua) -- North China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region has set up 93 enterprise groups to boost local
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
An official with the regional government said the move was
aimed at vitalizing the state-owned enterprises and changing the
mode of economic growth in the region.
</P>
<P>
In the region's textile and light industrial sector, nine
enterprise groups have been set up by mergers, issuing shares and
other forms.
</P>
<P>
The Ordos Woolens Group, consisting of 33 enterprises, has
expanded its business to other fields such as manufacturing of
electronics and medicine, and commerce and trade. The group
turned in 200 million yuan to the State in profits and taxes in
1995, ranking sixth in the nation's top 100 textile enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the establishment of enterprise groups helped
to concentrate capital, upgrade the existing enterprises and raise
production efficiency.

<HEADLINE> Xihu Lake Becomes Cleaner, More Beautiful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, July 6 (Xinhua) -- China's famous tourism spot, Xihu
Lake (the West Lake), has become cleaner and more beautiful with
the removal of more than 30 nearby factories.
</P>
<P>
The factories were threats to the lake in this scenic city
since they produced noise and serious pollution.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, the Xihu district government has allocated 50
million yuan for the construction of an industrial zone in a spot
far from the lake, to accommodate the displaced factories.
</P>
<P>
The old factories, including a water pump plant, electrical
plant and a paint spraying plant, have been used as kindergartens,
schools and dining halls.
</P>
<P>
Afforestation in nearby areas has also been speeded up in
tandem with the removal of factories.
</P>
<P>
Xihu Lake is located in Hangzhou City, east China's Zhejiang
Province. The lake's water area is 5.2 square kilometers, with a
circumference of 15 kilometers.

<HEADLINE> Russia Urges Belarus to Remove All Nuclear Devices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Russia today expressed regret that
Belarus has failed to dismantle and ship all the nuclear
facilities deployed in Belarus back to Russia as scheduled, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Viktor Esin, chief of the Russian Strategic Rocket Forces,
urged Belarus to dismantle and remove the remaining 18
nuclear-armed rockets to Russia before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Russian and Belorussian defence ministers agreed last December
to dismantle and remove all the nuclear devices, 81 in all
deployed in Belarus, to Russia before May 1996.
</P>
<P>
Interfax quoted Esin as saying that Russia and Belarus are now
working on a new schedule for dismantling and shipping the
remaining nuclear devices back to Russia.
</P>
<P>
The rocket army general said he hoped that Belarus will become
nuclear-free later in the year.
</P>
<P>
Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine were the four former
Soviet republics which had nuclear weapons. Kazakhstan and
Ukraine have already disassembled and shipped all the nuclear
devices deployed in their territories and have become nuclear-free
states.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- An Olympic Games security officer
was shot in the chest by a stray bullet while standing guard near
the Olympic Village, authorities said Friday.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Georgia State Olympic Law Enforcement
Command said Thomas Bentley, 43, standing guard at the entrance to
the Olympic Village, received a minor gunshot wound Thursday
evening by a bullet from an AK-47-type weapon fired from as far as
one mile away.
</P>
<P>
Bentley, from the Georgia National Guard, was rushed to the
Georgia Baptist Medical Center where he was treated for the wound
and released.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, Bill Wells, said it was a random type incident.
"Someone shooting in the air is not uncommon on the Fourth of July
or New Year's Eve."
</P>
<P>
However, the incident, coupled with another early on Friday,
put Atlanta's Olympic security system on red alert at a time when
the Olympic athletes was coming.
</P>
<P>
Two guards narrowly escaped injury when two men driving a
stolen car crashed into a tent early on Friday at a checkpoint
near the equestrian venue, east cident sent the security to a red
alert though it was confirmed later to be a false alarm.
</P>
<P>
The organizers have put federal agents from the Federal Bureau
of Investigation (FBI) and other agencies, and thousands of
Georgia state and local police.
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the Games, security forces have conducted
crisis response exercises and security has been tightened in the
state.

<HEADLINE> Perry Outlines Security Steps Taken since Bombings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Parry released on Friday a letter to lawmakers in an attempt
beforehand to dodge aside their oncoming attacks at the Defense
Department's lack of security measures resulting in a truck
bombing killing 19 Americans in a Saudi air base.
</P>
<P>
Perry is scheduled to testify before two senate panels
investigating allegations that the Defense Department was aware of
the danger to American troops in Saudi Arabia but failed to take
adequate precautions to protect U.S. servicemen's lives.
</P>
<P>
The defense secretary outlined in the letter security steps
taken right after the Riyadh bombing, that killed seven people,
including five Americans.
</P>
<P>
The letter, addressed to Strom Thurmond, Republican of South
Carolina, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, goes on
to say that additional security measures have been taken since the
truck bombing last week, moving personnel away from exposed rooms
and installing blast-resistant material on military apartments.
</P>
<P>
Perry also says that the U.S. military is considering to move
troops away from Riyadh and other cities vulnerable to terrorist
attacks to some remote desert bases.
</P>
<P>
Republicans are seeking Perry's resignation over the Saudi
truck bombing and Perry is struggling to fight off their
accusations.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Visits Saudi Arabia Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 5 (Xinhua) - French president Jacques Chirac will
leave for Saudi Arabia on Saturday on a one-day visit of
"friendship and respect" with a political nature.
</P>
<P>
The visit, the first by the president to the Gulf region, is
made 11 days after a terrorist attack on a U.S. air base in
Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, which killed 19 American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The French presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colona said that
the visit is made with the background that the president has
called for a more aggressive and ambitious foreign policy in the
Arab world.
</P>
<P>
She said that Saudi Arabia is France's major partner not only
because of its geographical position, but also because of its
influence in the Muslim-Arab world and the role it plays on the
regional "chessboard".
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said the Arab policy France is adopting
consists of four principles - dialogues of partnership on an equal
stand, support to Arab people in their rights of
self-determination, support to the aspiration of the Arab people
for solidarity and unity, and support to policies of openness and
peace in Arab states.
</P>
<P>
Accompanying Chirac are Defense Minister Charles Millon,
Foreign Minister Herve de Charette, Interior Minister Jean-Louis
Debre, Industry Minister Franck Borotra, the president of the Arab
Institute in Paris Camille Cabana, and the chairman of
France-Saudi Arabia Friendship Group in the French National
Assembly Olivier Dassault.
</P>
<P>
As in all his trips abroad, Chirac does not invite enterprise
leaders to accompany him.
</P>
<P>
After visiting Saudi Arabia, Chirac will go to Qatar on Sunday
for an official visit.
</P>
<P>
France is a major arms supplier to both Saudi Arabia and Qatar.

<HEADLINE> French Woman to Work on Russian Space Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 5 (Xinhua) - Claudie Andre-Deshays, a 39-year-old
rheumatologist, will become the first French women to work in
space.
</P>
<P>
Andre-Deshays will join the mission Cassiopee planned for
August 14-30, which will bring her to the Russian space station
"Mir". In the station, she will set up her lab for experiments on
salamanders, the tailed newtlike amphibian of the order Urodela.
</P>
<P>
Anne-Marie Duprat, head of the Fertile Experiment of Study on
Reproduction in Microgravity for which Andre-Deshays works, said
that Deshays has learned all technologies in physiology for
salamanders.
</P>
<P>
The group's study is based on six female salamenders that have
been fertilized for three years. Deshays will bring them to the
Mir station, inject hormone in them to make them lay eggs and in
the meantime observe the growth of the salamanders' embryos in
micro-gravity in the 14 days she stays 350 kilometers above earth.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to discover if gravity affects or not the way
salamanders grow and how their nerve tube, nerve system and organs
grow, as well as if the little salamanders will come out of their
eggs when returned to earth," said Duprat.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the biological experiments, Deshays will also join
experiments on effects of micro-gravity on human body, including
those on how human being controls its movement in space and why it
is difficult for man to make gestures in space.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Dow Plunges at Strong Job Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 5 (Xinhua) -- New York stock prices dropped
sharply Friday after a surprisingly strong June jobs report
renewed investors' fears about inflation and sent interest rates
soaring.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average slumped 114.88 points to
5,588.14, posting its seventh-largest point drop ever and pushing
the closing Dow below 5,600 for the first time since May 13.
</P>
<P>
It was the biggest point drop since the 171-point plunge on
March 8, in reaction to the first in a series of government
reports of unexpectedly strong jobs data.
</P>
<P>
Despite of Friday's 2.01 percent decline in Wall Street's
best-known indicator, the Dow still is up more than 9 percent from
the start of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Stocks and bonds reacted Friday to an early morning Labor
Department report that the nation's unemployment rate fell to 5.3
percent in June, the lowest level in six years, and that
businesses added 239,000 workers to payrolls, a sharply higher
figure than had been expected.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate had been 5.6 percent in May. Many
analysts had expected it to remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Although the central bank left rates unchanged at a two-day
policy meeting that ended before Thursday, investors concluded
from the new data that central bankers could tighten before the
next meeting in August.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues swamped advancers by nearly 7 to 1 on the New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Broad market indexes plunged as well. The NYSE's composite
index fell 7.13 to 353.24, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index fell 14.96 to 657.44. The Nasdaq composite index fell 23.25
to 1,158.35, and the American Stock Exchange's market value index
fell 5.32 to 574.33.
</P>
<P>
But volume was very light. The market closed early at 1 p.m.,
181.45 million shares had changed hands on the New York Stock
Exchange, compared with 334.57 million in a full session on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year Treasury bond plunged nearly 3 points. That pushed
up its yield, which rises when prices fall, to 7.18 percent from
6.93 percent late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Among the hardest hit sectors were transportation stocks,
viewed by many market participants as a market leader. The Dow
Jones transportation index plunged 57.08 points, or 2.60 percent,
to 2,139.81.
</P>
<P>
Financial and technology stocks were also hit hard by the run-up
in rates. m

<HEADLINE> Cause of Record Number of Manatees' Deaths Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 5 (Xinhua) -- American scentists have found that
a toxin from red tide is the cause of a record number of deaths
among manatees in Florida state this year, New York Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Manatees have been listed as the species nearing extinction.
Scientists believe that only some 2,600 manatees remain in the
wild.
</P>
<P>
304 manatees have died in Florida since the beginning of this
year, exceeding by nearly 50 percent the previous record, of 206
in 1990, according to the Florida Department of Environmental
Protection.
</P>
<P>
Of the 304 manatees deaths, 158 can be attributed to the
red-tide toxin, scientists at the University of Miami have
concluded.
</P>
<P>
Red tide is a collection of algae blooms whose formation is not
entiely understood but it is linked to wind and weather patterns.
It carries with it toxin which can kill fish and other aquatic
life including manatees. It variously peaked and waned off South
Florlida's western coast since September 1994, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
The finding, announced on Tuesday, was described as a major
step toward saving the manatee from extinction. Since the cause of
the manatee deaths is a natural one, scientists are working on
possible solution to the problem. One idea being mentioned is the
opening of floodgates along rivers on the gulf Coast in Florida
state, allowing more fresh water into near-shore areas and
lowering the concentration of red tide.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Denies Having Mercenaries in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- South African ambassador to Angola
Roger Tremer denied here today that the four South Africans UNITA
freed at its headquarters in Bailundo Thursday were mercenaries.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in an interview with a local radio, noting
that they are actually civilians, and not as UNITA claimed
mercenaries employed by the Angolan government.
</P>
<P>
Tremer said he was shocked by the way the National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) set the four South
Africans free by exposing them to the press.
</P>
<P>
UNITA has long complained that mercenaries, mostly from South
Africa, have not left Angola, alleging that about 4,500
mercenaries still stay in the country.
</P>
<P>
The four South Africans were captured in Angola's diamond area
in Lunda-Norte province in October 1995, and were found carrying
weapons which they claimed for self-defense.
</P>
<P>
Three of them said they were diamond miners while the other
admitted that he was employed by the Angolan government to
safeguard the safety of the diamond area.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, UNITA presented the four South Africans to the
media and then set them free. On the occasion, UNITA said three
of the men were mercenaries employed by South African-based
Executive Outcomes Company which is made up of former members of
the South African defense force.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the company was contracted by the Angolan
government to train its soldiers in the armed forces.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Suggests Extension of UN Force in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali recommended that the mandate of the United
Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III), the largest
peace-keeping operation of U.N., be extended for three months
until October 11.
</P>
<P>
He noted in his latest report to the Security Council that the
continued evolvement of UNAVEM III, which consists of 7,282
military persons and police officers, remains essential for the
peace process in Angola, particularly at this stage of the
implementation of the Lusaka Protocol.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali noted that both the Angolan government and the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) have
made progress in implementation of the Lusaka Protocol.
</P>
<P>
The positive developments include the adoption of the framework
agreement on military matters, the promulgation of the Amnesty Law
on May 8, the beginning of incorporation UNITA military personnel
into the Angolan Armed Forces (FAA), the completion of the
quartering of the rapid reaction police and quartering 50,000
UNITA troops as promised by UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
However, the parties have not fulfilled the time-frame agreed
upon between President dos Santos and Savimbi during their meeting
at Libreville on March 1, the secretary-general noted.
</P>
<P>
Continuing delays in the quartering of the remaining UNITA
troops, the high number desertions from the quarterings areas and
the incomplete withdrawal of FAA from forward positions all
require urgent corrective action if the peace process is to retain
credibility he said.
</P>
<P>
"The picture is no more reassuring on the political front. The
parties have yet to take a number of steps towards the formation
of the Government of Unity and National Reconciliation," he added.
</P>
<P>
If the peace process is to succeed, the parties in Angola,
especially UNITA, must show great readiness to implement the
commitments they have entered into, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean Govt Narrows Gap With Rebels: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leonean Foreign Minister
Maigore Kallon said here today the breach between the government
and the rebels has been "narrowed" in ongoing peace talks while
ceasefire is holding in the country.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua during the break of the second day
of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) Council of Ministers
meeting here, Kallon said the two warring sides have managed to
agree on 26 out of 28 articles of a drafted peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he admitted that "there are two crucial areas that
we disagree" during the ongoing talks in Abidjan, capital of Cote
d'Ivoire, including the process of disarmament and the control of
the budget.
</P>
<P>
The Rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) insisted that
within the first two months of the signing of the peace accord,
all the foreign mercenaries who have been in Sierra Leone to
assist the government forces be withdrawn, while the disarmament
process be finished within three months.
</P>
<P>
This was rejected by the government, according to the minister
who described the proposal as "ridiculous".
</P>
<P>
He said his government counter-proposed that within three
months following the signing of the peace accord, the foreign
mercenaries withdraw simultaneously with the disarmament of the
RUF rebels.
</P>
<P>
On the budget issue, the RUF insisted on setting up a joint
committee with the government to "co-manage" the country's budget
and the foreign debt, which was also rejected by the government.
</P>
<P>
According to Kallon, the Freetown government insisted the
budget be controlled by parliament which includes the ruling
Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP) and six other opposition
parties.
</P>
<P>
"If the RUF is willing to talk, they can form their own party
and join parliament through voting," he noted.
</P>
<P>
On questions over the results of the ongoing peace talks in
Abidjan, the minister said he was "cautiously optimistic".
</P>
<P>
He admitted that while the negotiating process is going on,
acts of violation of the ceasefire agreement, signed in march
following the swearing-in ceremony of newly-elected President
Tejan Kabbah, have also been reported in the country's districts
of Tonkolili, Bo, Kenema and Pujehun.
</P>
<P>
"But generally speaking, ceasefire is holding," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> BA Pilots Plan All-out Strike Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 5 (Xinhua) -- British Airways (BA) pilots and
flight engineers are threatening an all-out indefinite strike from
0400 GMT on July 16 unless the firm settles a pay dispute,
according to a BBC TV report today.
</P>
<P>
The strike could ground the BA fleet at the height of the
summer season. BA has said it hoped to avoid a strike but hinted
that it would bring in outside pilots to ensure that its services
continued.
</P>
<P>
The announcement from the British Airline Pilots' Association
(BALPA), which represents around 80 percent of BA pilots, follows
a 90 percent ballot in favour of a strike by BA flight crew.
</P>
<P>
BALPA said it was giving BA time to come up with a new offer
before taking action.
</P>
<P>
According to British law, BALPA only has to give the company
seven days notice of strike action. But the association said it
was giving extra notice because it was still willing to resolve
the dispute through talks.
</P>
<P>
The strike is over the relatively low pay of some pilots at
London's Gatwick airport and over inadequate pension provision.
</P>
<P>
A BA spokesman said its directors had met to discuss the strike
threat and the company had worked out a contingency plan to cater
for those hit by the July 16 strike. BA was most concerned to
protect customer interests, but would welcome further discussions,
he added.
</P>
<P>
BALPA said that a strike could cost BA 40 million pounds (62
million US dollars) a day.
