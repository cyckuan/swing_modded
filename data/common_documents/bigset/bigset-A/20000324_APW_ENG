Study: World's Oceans Warming
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A significant, surprising new study shows a warming of the
world's oceans over the past 40 years, providing evidence that computer models
may be on target when they predict the Earth's warming. The broad study of
temperature data from the oceans, dating to the 1950s, shows average
temperatures have increased more than expected -- about half a degree Fahrenheit
closer to the surface, and one-tenth of a degree even at depths of up to 10,000
feet. The findings were reported by scientists at the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration.

CDC Report Examines America's Health
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The Centers for Disease Control released a survey on healthy
behavior Thursday, saying Mississippians battle the bulge with less success than
the rest of us -- 22 percent of them are obese -- while nearly 25 percent of
Texans have no health insurance. Wisconsin has the most drinkers, where
residents also confessed to the most binge drinking. The survey was broken down
by race and ethnic groups for each state and Puerto Rico. The numbers, culled
from 1997 telephone interviews with 134,000 people, highlight continuing
disparities between whites and other racial groups when it comes to such factors
as high blood pressure, obesity and lack of access to medical care.

U.S. Sales of Food to Cuba OK'd
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate Foreign Relations Committee agreed to allow
sales of food and medicine to Cuba Thursday after the chairman, Sen. Jesse
Helms, dropped his opposition to easing the 40-year-old embargo on the communist
government. The sales could not be federally subsidized, and Helms said that
will protect U.S. ''moral and national security interests.'' The Cuba provision
was included in a foreign assistance bill that also authorizes $600 million in
debt relief to developing countries and $300 million in aid for victims of the
African AIDS epidemic.

Audit: Rural AIDS Funds Lacking
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government provides more money for AIDS patients in
big cities than it does for those living outside urban areas, even as the number
of rural AIDS cases is rising, federal auditors found. The government spent
$3,081 on every AIDS patient in Atlanta, but only $2,303 each on those living
elsewhere in Georgia, the audit released today said. Atlanta had 6,119 AIDS
patients; the rest of the state had 2,657. Large cities like Atlanta, Chicago
and New York have the largest AIDS caseloads.

Taiwan President Leaves Party Post
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan president Lee Teng-hui resigned as leader of
the ruling Nationalist Party on Friday, becoming the biggest victim of the
opposition's stunning upset in Taiwan's presidential elections. Since the
party's humiliating defeat in Saturday's election, protesters have demonstrated
outside the Nationalists' headquarters, demanding that President Lee resign
immediately as party chairman. Lee, who has led Taiwan for 12 years, had offered
to step down in September. Then on Thursday, he told party leaders he would
resign Friday.

'Smart Scalpel' Would Find Cancers
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- A so-called ''smart scalpel'' -- a computerized
fiber-optic laser device -- is being developed to analyze cells and determine
instantly if they're cancerous, helping patients avoid additional biopsies.
Sandia National Laboratories with help from the University of New Mexico medical
school is working on the dime-sized device. It's not actually a scalpel -- it
would be used in conjunction with a surgeon's scalpel. The device contains a
microscopic spectrometer that analyzes protein density in a cell and a tiny
vacuum that sucks cells through microchip-connected sensors for analysis during
surgery.

Crew Abandons Sinking Greek Ship
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HAMILTON, Bermuda (AP) -- A Greek cargo ship with 31 crew members aboard sank
in the Atlantic Ocean more than 400 miles off of Bermuda Thursday, forcing the
sailors to take to lifeboats and wait on rough seas for rescuers still hours
away. The 776-foot Leader L sent out a distress call at 1:32 p.m. EST that it
was taking on water through a 45-foot gash in the right side of the hull, said
Allison von Hagn, a U.S. Coast Guard spokeswoman in Norfolk, Virginia. The crew

<HEADLINE> Pataki flies across state handing out good news  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- In a break from slogging through paperwork
back at the office, Gov. George Pataki flew across upstate New York
state on a five-stop foray that had all the trappings of a
re-election campaign trip.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the governor's current term doesn't expire until the
end of 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Pataki camp has been facing increased activity
on the Democratic side with state Comptroller H. Carl McCall and
federal Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo jockeying for position.
McCall has told supporters he plans to run for governor while Cuomo
has said he is considering it.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Republican Pataki looked like he had already made
the decision to run for a third term.
</P>
<P>
   In Rome, Pataki visited the old Griffiss Air Force base to
announce that the Morgan Corporation, the nation's largest truck
body builder, would be opening a manufacturing plant at the
Griffiss Business and Technology Park, meaning up to 400 new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In the Buffalo suburb of Depew, Pataki announced that the
world's largest commercial printer, Quebecor World, was investing
$15 million to expand it operations there and create 400 new jobs.
He also announced $2.5 million worth of ''community enhancement''
projects in the western New York area.
</P>
<P>
   At a stop in the Rochester area, Pataki announced the award of
$1.7 million for a recreation trail and $1.26 million for other
community enhancement projects in Livingston, Monroe and Wyoming
counties.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki ended his day's travels in the Syracuse area, handing out
$1.8 million in revitalization and recreation grants, including
$480,000 for a recreation trail along the west side of Onondaga
Lake.
</P>
<P>
   While they didn't get visits from the governor, other regions of
the state shared in the goodies.
</P>
<P>
   The Lake Champlain region got $2 million and Long Island
received $5.6 million for water quality projects. The New York City
area got $2.6 million for recreation and historic preservation
projects, including $500,000 to help build a 900-foot long fishing
pier at South Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki even enlisted Lt. Gov. Mary Donohue to pass out state
money. She visited Norwich to announce $1.2 million worth of grants
for community projects in the Southern Tier.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor is committed to keeping the economy moving
forward and these are projects and announcements that are geared
toward that goal,'' Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon said.
''Improving the quality of life and improving the economy go hand
in hand and that's what the governor's message is today.''

<HEADLINE> Religion in the News  </HEADLINE>
By ELLIOTT MINOR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYLVESTER, Ga. (AP) -- Elder Tony Marshall steps into the pulpit
Sunday morning at the Providence Primitive Baptist Church, an
austere structure nestled between a cemetery and moss-draped scrub
oaks.
</P>
<P>
   The interior is unadorned but radiant in its simplicity.
Varnished pine planks cover the walls and ceiling. The 25, mostly
elderly, worshippers sit on plain wooden pews. There are no
crosses, no pictures of Jesus or other religious symbols. Old-line
Primitives consider these to be graven images.
</P>
<P>
   Primitives trace their faith to John the Baptist. They take
their beliefs from the King James Version of the Old and New
Testaments. They define primitive as the ''original'' religion.
</P>
<P>
   With an estimated 50,000 members, they are a relatively small
group with deep ties to the South. By comparison, the nation's
largest Baptist group, the Southern Baptist Convention, has 15.8
million members.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall reminded his congregation in rural southwest Georgia of
the need to trust in God for deliverance.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be days when we don't consider God,'' Marshall
said. ''We try to go on our own strength. But all our strength
comes from God.''
</P>
<P>
   Primitive ministers, known as elders, might study their Bibles
before a sermon, but they believe the sermon itself comes directly
from God. Instead of attending seminaries, potential elders are
handpicked by church leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, a 40-year-old Valdosta electrician, has been a
Primitive all his life. His father, grandfather and uncle also are
elders.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel like it's the true church,'' Marshall said. ''I believe
what we believe is the true salvation.''
</P>
<P>
   Old-line Primitives don't have professional preachers. They want
their elders to be engaged totally in teaching the Bible, not
working for financial rewards. They also don't pass a collection
plate, but worshippers can leave a ''love offering'' for the
elders.
</P>
<P>
   To show their humility and love for one another, worshippers
pair off once or twice a year and wash each other's feet during
communion services. This ritual is based on the Last Supper, when
Jesus washed his disciples' feet.
</P>
<P>
   They use wine for communion, baptize by immersion and don't
tolerate adultery, bankruptcy or divorce, except in cases of
adultery by the offending spouse.
</P>
<P>
   Some faiths allow sinners to repent and regain their standing in
the church. Primitives kick sinners out.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Bible is all we've got to go by,'' said Zell Clinard, a
70-year-old lifelong Primitive from Albany. ''The Bible lists all
the rules and regulations. People make fun of us because we wash
feet, but they didn't read the Bible, or they would know that we're
doing something Jesus left for us to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Sunday service, three deacons standing near the
pulpit led 30 minutes of singing. Worshippers used a small hymnal
with no musical notations, only words. Old-liners don't believe the
Bible authorizes organs or other instruments in the church.
</P>
<P>
   Primitive churches are scattered all over the country, including
places like Cincinnati where Southern blacks migrated in the 1900s.
But they are most prominent in the backwoods of rural southern
Georgia and northern Florida, where Primitives were among the early
settlers. Before the Civil War, black slaves attended Primitive
churches with their white masters. Later, they established churches
for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most other Baptists, Primitives believe in a strict form
of predestination -- that God chose people from all races and creeds
for salvation even before the world was formed. They believe God's
elect will naturally want to live sin-free lives and accept Jesus,
although the elect can include people who have never heard of Jesus
or set foot in a church.
</P>
<P>
   The term Primitive Baptist stems from an ideological split in
the 1830s with a group that eventually became ''Missionary
Baptists.''
</P>
<P>
   Missionary Baptists, including the Southern Baptist Convention,
believe they have a duty to go out and save souls. Primitives
believe God needs no help rescuing lost souls. When they split,
Missionary Baptists called those remaining primitives.
</P>
<P>
   The Primitive Baptist faith is thriving, despite its
unwillingness to offer modern religious trappings, such as Sunday
School and music programs, said Bob Dickerson, a retired accountant
who publishes the ''Gospel Appeal,'' a Primitive Baptist
newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not changed to go along with modern times,'' said
Dickerson, elder at Cat Creek Primitive Baptist Church, north of
Valdosta. ''We are still following what we understand the
scriptures to mean, which is praying, preaching and singing.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleston Brooks, an elder at Prosperity Church, north of
Bainbridge, said some country churches may fold because of the
migration to the cities for jobs, but he's confident the religion
will survive.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe when Jesus comes again, his church will still be
here and it will be doing well,'' said Brooks, a Sylvester
pharmacist.
</P>
<P>
   While old-line Primitives have resisted change, another faction
known as the progressives pay their elders and provide Sunday
schools and youth camps. They also permit the use of musical
instruments.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're reaching out,'' said George Daunhauer, elder of the
progressive Statesboro Primitive Baptist Church. ''We realize that
this is what we're commanded to do by the word of God, all with the
realization that it's not our efforts that determine the population
of heaven.''

<HEADLINE> Third parties consider Senate-race coalition; Randall Terry eyesrace  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The head of the state Conservative Party has
opened talks with leaders of two other third parties in New York --
the Ross Perot-inspired Independence Party and the anti-abortion
Right to Life Party -- about fielding a fusion candidate for New
York's U.S. Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate seat is already being sought by Democrat Hillary
Rodham Clinton and Republican Rudolph Giuliani, the mayor of New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a real possibility that we could put a person on the
(Conservative Party) line that would have three lines,''
Conservative Party boss Michael Long said Thursday. ''That would
change the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Long met with leaders of the Independence Party -- which is the
New York arm of the Reform Party -- and the Right to Life Party
recently at a Brooklyn restaurant. The talk centered on fielding an
anti-abortion candidate who could appeal to all three parties.
</P>
<P>
   One source familiar with the restaurant summit, and speaking
only on condition of anonymity, said that among the potential
candidates discussed were former U.S. Rep. Joseph DioGuardi of
Westchester County, a Republican, and former Watertown Mayor Jeff
Graham, an Independence Party leader.
</P>
<P>
   Third parties are particularly important in New York this year
with polls showing Giuliani and Clinton in a close contest.
</P>
<P>
   No Republican candidate running for statewide office in New York
has won without the backing of the Conservative Party in 25 years.
Such backing can be crucial in a close race because unlike other
states, New York allows major party candidates to add third-party
votes to their totals when determining a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Long has insisted that for Giuliani to have Conservative Party
backing, he must support a ban on what critics call ''partial-birth
abortion.'' The New York City mayor has refused to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Independence Party leaders are inviting Clinton, Giuliani and
other potential Senate candidates to a forum in Buffalo on April 29
to discuss individually why they should be given the party's
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, anti-abortion activist and Operation Rescue founder
Randall Terry said Thursday that he may get into New York's Senate
race, even as a spoiler, because Giuliani ''is a threat to the
pro-life movement.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I would rather see a pro-abortion Democrat in office than a
pro-abortion Republican,'' said Terry, who lost a 1998 Republican
primary to run for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Both Giuliani and Clinton are abortion rights supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Terry said he will make a decision about running for the Senate
by the beginning of May. The anti-abortion activist said that
decision is complicated because he is devoting much of his time to
working against legislation in Vermont that could legalize domestic
partnerships for gays.
</P>
<P>
   ''Frankly, the Vermont fight is a more important one than this
Senate race because if we lose in Vermont we're going to have
homosexual marriage in the whole country,'' Terry said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If another strong pro-life Republican were to enter the race
against Giuliani, then I would not run,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   After losing his bid for the Republican congressional nomination
in 1998, Terry stayed in the race as the Right to Life Party's
candidate. Democratic incumbent Maurice Hinchey was re-elected in
the race.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, former state Attorney General Dennis Vacco, a
Giuliani supporter, said he has been urged by friends to consider
entering the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's tempting to the extent that I believe I still have
something to contribute ... I have a sense of having left with
unfinished business,'' said Vacco, who narrowly lost his bid for a
second term in 1998 to Democrat Eliot Spitzer.
</P>
<P>
   But Vacco, now a waste industry executive, said ''at this stage,
it's a little bit too late for a new entrant into this race ... As
the old saying goes, timing is everything in politics.''

<HEADLINE> National Guard units adjust terrorism response teams aftercriticism  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL GORMLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- An evolving threat requires an evolving
response team and that's what's happened to 10 elite teams around
the country that will soon be ready to react to terrorist attacks,
military officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The elite units of the National Guard in 10 states including New
York will be certified in April to respond in the wake of chemical,
biological and other ''weapons of mass destruction'' on
communities, Pentagon officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But even the number of units and their names have evolved since
the program was criticized in a federal audit last year as
unnecessary, unwieldily and a threat to civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   The latest of several hearings stemming from concern in Congress
is scheduled for today before the Senate Armed Services Committee
in Washington, said Ian Thomas, a Department of Defense staffer.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the concern followed a federal General Accounting Office
audit released in June. It found local, state and federal officials
still had different views on the role and use of the Pentagon's
Rapid Assessment and Initial Detection (RAID) program announced two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Auditors found that while states with the federally funded units
were ''very enthusiastic,'' states without the units were concerned
the teams couldn't respond fast enough across borders.
</P>
<P>
   New York's unit, for example, is assigned to the Air National
Guard base in Scotia, 15 miles west of Albany, and is supposed to
respond to terrorism strikes in New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico
and the Virgin Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the New York team that has trained for 18
months took on a mock incident. At the airbase in Scotia and in
front of television crews, the team entered a bus for a
make-believe exercise aimed at dealing with gas that supposedly
left riders ill.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in blue, baggy plastic ''space suits'' and gas masks,
the team carried ''high-tech sniffers.'' National Guard Lt. Col.
Paul Fanning said data was run through an on-site computer to
determine how far the gas might have spread given weather
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The unit provided advice to about 50 local firefighters and
emergency medical technicians who were on hand for the mock
terrorist-type incident.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency remains supportive of
the guard's involvement but opposed to regional teams, said agency
spokesman Marc Wolfson. He said the key to effective response is
for each governor to have the ability to order a response,
including its own National Guard troops.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional auditors said some local, state and federal
officials believe the units aren't needed at all, because of
agencies like the FEMA and state agencies like New York State
Emergency Management Office.
</P>
<P>
   Even the name has come under assault. The acronym -- RAID --
wasn't popular outside the Pentagon. Part of that is because of the
public's continued concern following the 1993 federal siege at
Waco, Texas, in which 80 people died, Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the name for the units was changed to the Weapons of
Mass Destruction Civil Support Teams.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO audit also questioned the response times of the teams.
While defense officials challenged the assessment, Congress
authorized another 17 units. The units are popular back home in
congressional districts and by 2001 will be operational in the
nation's largest population centers, including two teams in
California.
</P>
<P>
   ''Critics of this program have frequently complained about
duplication of efforts,'' said Charles Cragin, principal deputy
assistant secretary of defense for reserve affairs. ''But these
arguments miss the point by overlooking the unique state-based
nature'' of them.
</P>
<P>
   New York's deputy adjutant general, Brig. Gen. William Martin,
said ''the GAO report initially drew some conclusions that led to
some concerns, but I think there's been a lot of work done.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an emerging role for the nation to address ... when
the concept unfolded it brought some uncertainty and initial
confusion as to what the role of the military will be,'' Martin
added.
</P>
<P>
   ''If terrorists release bacteria, chemicals or viruses to harm
Americans, we must have the ability to identify the pathogens or
substances with speed and certainty,'' Cragin said. He said the
units will support local police, fire and emergency personnel with
expensive, high-tech equipment that could bust local budgets.
</P>
<P>
   The teams -- each of 22 full-time, federally trained members of
the Army and Air National Guard armed with special laboratory and
communications equipment -- will report to governors, unless
federalized by the president in a broader emergency.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon spent $60 million last year for units in New York,
Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, California, Massachusetts, Missouri,
Pennsylvania, Texas and the state of Washington. The current
federal budget includes $75 million more for the program. About $58
million of that will fund the additional units that weren't
envisioned two years ago, Cragin said.

<HEADLINE> Bausch &AMP; Lomb offers to buy Wesley Jessen for $600 million  </HEADLINE>
By BEN DOBBIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Bausch &AMP; Lomb Inc. wants to snap up
Illinois-based Wesley Jessen VisionCare Inc. for about $600 million
to gain ground in the color contact lens market. Wesley Jessen
seems to prefer taking its own expansionist route.
</P>
<P>
   Bausch &AMP; Lomb's $34-a-share bid could thwart Wesley Jessen's
acquisition of Ocular Sciences Inc., a rival contact lens maker in
San Francisco. Wesley Jessen of Des Plaines, Ill., said Monday it
had agreed to buy Ocular Sciences for about $18 a share, or $413
million.
</P>
<P>
   Bausch &AMP; Lomb revealed Thursday it was interested in buying
Wesley Jessen, but it doesn't want Ocular Sciences. Its proposed
merger would expand Bausch &AMP; Lomb's contact lens revenues of $475
million in 1999 by more than $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, Wesley Jessen said it remained committed to the
Ocular Sciences buyout but would respond to Bausch &AMP; Lomb's offer
''in an appropriate time frame.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations between Bausch &AMP; Lomb and Wesley Jessen had been
under way for several weeks, Bausch &AMP; Lomb chief executive William
Carpenter said. In a letter to Wesley Jessen CEO Kevin Ryan, he
expressed surprise and regret to hear of the Ocular Sciences deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would ideally hope -- and quite frankly expect -- that Wesley
Jessen would recognize the merit of (Bausch &AMP; Lomb's) deal and
ultimately allow us to sit down and very quickly bring it to
conclusion,'' Carpenter told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   He said Bausch &AMP; Lomb was prepared to make a hostile offer for
Wesley Jessen, taking ''this deal directly to the shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Wesley Jessen has built its success in the contact lens market
by focusing on higher-end products such as cosmetic tinted lenses,
while Bausch &AMP; Lomb has concentrated on premium disposable and
continuous-wear lenses, Carpenter said.
</P>
<P>
   Acquiring Wesley Jessen would ''further broaden Bausch &AMP; Lomb's
portfolio in vision care, which is the deepest in the industry,''
said Douglas Christopher, an analyst with Crowell Weedon &AMP; Co. in
Los Angeles. ''The acquisition makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Bausch &AMP; Lomb dropped 87{ cents to $55.50 on the New
York Stock Exchange Thursday. Shares of Ocular Sciences were priced
at $16.25 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, down $1 or nearly 6 percent.
Shares of Wesley-Jessen were at $33.43}, up $8.56\ or more than 34
percent, also on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Bausch had $1.76 billion in sales last year and Wesley Jessen
had $311.7 million in sales.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Groups call for state ballot changes following presidential ballotfiasco  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- After a destructive battle to keep Arizona
Sen. John McCain out of the New York's GOP presidential primary,
Republicans are planning to reform their process. Good government
groups say legislators should follow their lead and do the same for
the legislative primary ballot access rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''This isn't just about John McCain,'' Barbara Bartoletti,
legislative director of the League of Women Voters, told an Albany
news conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The group, along with Common Cause and the New York Public
Interest Research Group, want the same reforms to trickle down to
legislative races. ''This should be about citizens have the ability
to vote for the candidate of their choice,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki led an unsuccessful effort to use the state's
complex ballot access rules to keep everyone but Texas Gov. George
W. Bush off the New York primary ballot this year, leading to
widespread national criticism when McCain started winning in other
states.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge eventually opened up New York's ballot to
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki and other New York Republicans now say they will reform
the presidential primary rules.
</P>
<P>
   State lawmakers have tried to use the same laws to keep their
challengers off the ballot, the groups noted Thursday. In New York
City, specific challenges to knock candidates off the ballot
increased 24 percent between 1996 and 1998, they said. And out of
the 42 challenges filed in 1998, only two were against incumbents,
the groups found. After the 1996 presidential primary, the ballot
access laws were eased.
</P>
<P>
   Blair Horner, legislative director for NYPIRG, called the
state's complex ballot access laws its ''incumbency protection
plan.''
</P>
<P>
   With the entire Legislature up for election this year, doubts
have been raised about any meaningful changes taking effect until
next year or later.
</P>
<P>
   The groups said they want officials to eliminate requirements
that require petition gatherers to live in the election district,
that require petition signers to list the town or city in which
they live and that restrict people from signing more than one
primary petition.
</P>
<P>
   The residency requirements for petition gatherers were ruled
unconstitutional for the presidential primary by the federal judge
in the McCain challenge and a state judge would probably do the
same if someone challenged it in a local race, the groups said.
</P>
<P>
   And allowing people to sign only one candidate's petition is
tantamount to forcing them to vote before the primary even begins,
said Rachel Leon, executive director of the state's chapter of
Common Cause.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a difference between signing a petition and voting,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The groups have sent letters to Pataki, Assembly Speaker Sheldon
Silver and Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno asking the three men
to change the ballot access rules.
</P>
<P>
   Failing any movement by state leaders, Bartoletti said, ''We're
perfectly willing to go back to court.''

<HEADLINE> Wizards 100, Nuggets 86  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Juwan Howard had 22 points and 11 rebounds and
Mitch Richmond added 22 points as the Washington Wizards dealt the
Denver Nuggets their 10th loss in their last 11 games, 100-86 on
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Howard, who has averaged 15 points and five rebounds over the
past five games, hit 10 of 21 shots for Washington, which is 9-26
on the road but 3-2 in its last five road games.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve Aaron Williams had 15 points and Chris Whitney 14 points
for the Wizards, unbeaten in their last three trips to Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Van Exel and George McCloud led Denver with 18 points each.
The Nuggets failed to score at least 90 points in three consecutive
games for the first time this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Nuggets cut seven points off a 79-61 lead with a 9-2 run
with McCloud hitting a baseline jumper and a 3-pointer and Raef
LaFrentz hit a jump shot in the paint to get within 81-70.
Williams, a former Nugget, hit three straight jumpers and Troy
Murray hit a shot from the corner and a 3-pointer to put Washington
back ahead 92-74 with 3:50 left.
</P>
<P>
   Leading 56-42 at halftime, the Wizards went on a 11-0 run to
start the third quarter with Howard providing five points to build
a 67-42 lead. The Nuggets went over four minutes without scoring,
missing their first 10 shots of the half before reserve Chris
Herren hit a 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   With McDyess scoring five points over the next four minutes, the
Nuggets got within 73-56 with 3:01 left in the quarter. Richmond
and Murray hit two free throws each in the last two minutes as
Washington took a 17-point lead into the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Nuggets coach Dan Issel was ejected late in the first half when
referee Steve Javie called two technical fouls on him. It was
Issel's fifth ejection of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards led 25-21 after the first quarter and opened the
second quarter with a 9-2 run with Williams hitting a free throw
and 10-foot jumper in the lane to lead 34-23. Denver began going to
the offensive boards particularly Chris Gatling, who had five
points after offensive rebounds and when Ryan Bowen put back a miss
with 2:25 left, the Nuggets had cut the lead to 44-39.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's lead was 49-39 when Van Exel was fouled with 61
seconds left in the half, but before he shot Issel was called for
his first technical. He then went onto to the court to challenge
the call and was hit with another one.
Notes: The Wizards placed guard Rod Strickland on the injured list
and activated center Calvin Booth. ... Gerard King made his 16th
consecutive start at small forward. ... Denver is 11-15 against
Eastern Conference teams. ... Washington has 73 offensive rebounds
in its last five games.

<HEADLINE> Michigan St. 75, Syracuse 58  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY ATKINS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- A halftime tirade by Mateen Cleaves
got Michigan State turned around and kept the Spartans on track for
a second straight trip to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   The top-seeded Spartans, trailing by as many as 14, roared back
to beat Syracuse 75-58 on Thursday night in the Midwest Regional
semifinals, scoring 17 straight points over the last 5:54.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had to pick up the pick up the pieces at halftime when I got
to the locker room,'' Michigan State coach Tom Izzo said. ''Mateen
did most of the challenging. He did a heck of a job in talking to
them. He helps do my job when I'm not there.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves, who returned for his senior year with the express hope
of winning a national championship, felt the Spartans were rushing
their shots, not sticking with what they had done in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''At halftime, I didn't think we were playing hard,'' Cleaves
said. ''I don't mind guys missing shots. I don't mind if things
aren't going right. But if you're not playing hard, then I'm going
to get in your face.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans (29-7) will play the Iowa State (32-4) on Saturday
night for a trip to the Final Four in Indianapolis. The No.
2-seeded Cyclones beat UCLA 80-56 in the other Midwest semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse (26-6) looked ready to run the Spartans right out of
The Palace, to the dismay of a highly partisan Michigan State
crowd. But Cleaves backed up his halftime talk with some
championship style play early in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ''They came out in the second half and made some big 3s,'' said
Syracuse point guard Jason Hart, who had 11 points and 10 assists.
''We held them off as long as we could.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves, scoreless in the first half, had 10 points -- most of
them early in the second half -- to get the Spartans rolling. Morris
Peterson had 16 of his 21 points in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Then Charlie Bell -- who scored nine of his 12 points in the
second half -- put the Orangemen away.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Griffin led Syracuse with 14 points. Etan Thomas, the
shot-blocker the Spartans feared most, had seven points, six
rebounds -- and just two blocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans, who have won the Big Ten championship three
straight years, trailed by 10 at halftime and were behind 40-26
after just 1:04 gone in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   But the Spartans had been behind before. They needed a
second-half comeback to beat Utah on Saturday in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Could they do it again?
</P>
<P>
   Peterson hit three 3-pointers, Cleaves hit two 3s and A.J.
Granger hit one as the Spartans roared back. A floater in the lane
by Cleaves cut the Syracuse lead to 49-46 with 12:03 left.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the game was on.
</P>
<P>
   ''The momentum swung their way,'' Hart said. ''Morris Peterson
hit some tough 3-point shots. I'd bet if he took some of those
shots again, they wouldn't go in.
</P>
<P>
   ''But, big time players make big plays. He's a big time
player.''
</P>
<P>
   Two straight baskets by Griffin gave Syracuse a five-point lead,
but Granger's 3-pointer narrowed the gap to 54-53 with 8:58 left
and Granger's layup cut it to one again, 56-55, with 7:04
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, who needed acupuncture on his ailing left knee all week,
finally put the Spartans ahead, 58-56, for the first time since
early in the game with a 3-pointer from the top of the arc.
</P>
<P>
   A layup by Hart tied it at 58-all moments later, setting up a
final six minutes of joyous mayhem for the sellout crowd of 21,214
mostly green-and-white clad fans.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans, who shot 68 percent in the second half, took the
lead for good on Bell's banker with 5:18 left, starting a
game-ending 17-0 run. Bell also had a basket in the paint, followed
by Peterson's 3-pointer that gave the Spartans a 63-58 lead and let
the Orangemen know they were finished.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've watched college basketball for a long time,'' Syracuse
guard Tony Bland said. ''I think they're one of the best teams, not
just that I saw play this year, but saw play in a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they have the elements they need to win a national
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   The one thing the Spartans perhaps feared most -- a cold shooting
night -- helped them go without a field goal for almost the final
eight minutes of the first half until Granger's three-point play
with 1.2 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   That sent Syracuse off with a 34-24 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Orangemen's defense had a lot to do with Michigan State's
poor shooting, as well. With Thomas blocking up the middle, the
Spartans hit only three of their last 14 shots of the half, missing
seven straight during one stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Izzo, generally very animated along the sideline, spent the last
two minutes of the half on the bench, his chin in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   When the game ended, however, Izzo and Cleaves were lost in a
huge bear hug.

<HEADLINE> House OKs $1.82 Trillion Budget  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite unrest by some conservatives,
Republicans drove a $1.82 trillion budget for 2001 through the
House early Friday, mapping deeper tax cuts and lower domestic
spending than President Clinton wants.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next five years, the measure would set aside at least
$150 billion for tax cuts and the entire $1 trillion in projected
Social Security surpluses for debt reduction. It would also provide
up to $40 billion to create a prescription drug benefit for
Medicare recipients, though Republicans would narrow Clinton's plan
to exclude higher-income senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Final approval came on a mostly party-line 211-207 roll call
shortly after midnight, nearly 14 hours after debate began. And
despite ongoing dissension by Senate conservatives, it moved
Republicans a step closer to their goal of adjourning Congress by
early fall so GOP lawmakers can go home and defend their House and
Senate majorities in the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're for the reform agenda, you're going to support this
budget,'' said House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio,
echoing a campaign theme of apparent GOP presidential nominee
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In a replay of last year's budget fight, Democrats accused
Republicans of squandering surpluses from non-Social Security
programs on tax breaks for the wealthy, and doing little to
buttress Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Likening the Republican budget to a television game show, Rep.
Brad Sherman, D-Calif., asked, ''Who wants to risk Social Security
to give huge tax breaks to multi-multi-multi-millionaires?''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the GOP plan embraces spending cuts so severe
that Congress would never approve, and they challenged the GOP's
numbers, saying the Republican plan would eat into Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans denied that, with Kasich saying that to arrive at
that conclusion, Democrats had to ''cook numbers and make things
up.''
</P>
<P>
   The budget, which does not need the president's signature, sets
overall tax and spending targets for the fiscal year that begins
Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP plan would match or exceed Clinton's proposals for
defense, schools and veterans, and calls for tax cuts for many
married couples and for health care and other expenses. But such
details are advisory only, and lawmakers will shape specific
programs in later bills.
</P>
<P>
   Reiterating administration opposition to the GOP plan, White
House budget chief Jack Lew wrote congressional leaders that it is
''fundamentally flawed and fails to provide a balanced and workable
economic plan. In the past, this approach has delayed, rather than
expedited, action on'' subsequent budget legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Most Republicans supported the proposal. But eight conservatives
voted ''no'' on an early procedural vote because they said it
lacked controls to ensure that spending remained within budget.
</P>
<P>
   ''It means we'll spend $25 billion to $30 billion more than what
we say,'' said Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., a leader of the
discontented group. ''It's another wink and nod from Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   With the GOP's wafer-thin 11-seat House margin, their defections
could jeopardize the budget's final passage. Party leaders labored
throughout the day to quell the uprising, and succeeded after
promising efforts to prevent spending bills from growing as they
move through the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative disaffection was mirrored in the Senate. There,
Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., has yet to
even try pushing a similar plan through his panel because
conservatives want to hold spending down.
</P>
<P>
   At issue was the $596.5 billion the budget would set aside for
jet fighters, road building and every other federal function but
automatically paid benefits like Medicare and interest on the debt.
</P>
<P>
   Of that amount, $307 billion would be for defense, $1 billion
more than Clinton's request. Its $289 billion for domestic programs
is almost $30 billion below the president's plan.
</P>
<P>
   In early votes, the House overwhelmingly rejected five rival
budgets by black, progressive and conservative Democrats,
Democratic leaders and conservative Republicans.	   As they did when Kasich
pushed the plan through his committee
last week, Republicans blocked a Democratic effort to force a vote
on the $483 billion, five-year tax cut Bush has proposed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's proposal and the congressional tax cut are not directly
comparable because they cover different five-year periods.
Nonetheless, the Bush plan would eat into Social Security surpluses
as projected by Congress, and few Republicans would be comfortable
voting to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proposed $99 billion in tax cuts over the next five
years, nearly offset by $96 billion in higher cigarette and some
business taxes.
</P>
<P>
   House conservatives won a promise from GOP leaders to pursue at
least $4 billion more in debt reduction this year.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, they dropped budget language that would have
prohibited spending any of this year's projected $27 billion
surplus. In effect, that would have killed a separate $9 billion
measure financing anti-drug efforts in Colombia, U.S. troops in
Kosovo, and aid to victims of Hurricane Floyd and other domestic
disasters.

<HEADLINE> Iowa St. 80, UCLA 56  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COYNE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Iowa State used its quickness and
defense to ground UCLA's high-flying offense, then put the Bruins
away with steady shooting and strong inside play.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Fizer, Stevie Johnson and Michael Nurse had 16 points
each as the second-seeded Cyclones beat the sixth-seeded Bruins
80-56 on Thursday night in the Midwest Regional semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Jamaal Tinsley added 14 points to help the Cyclones (32-4)
extend their winning streak to 10 games and advance to the final
eight for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State will face top-seeded Michigan State on Saturday. The
Spartans beat Syracuse 75-58.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's acrobatic offense, which produced 14 alley-oop baskets in
a 35-point victory over Maryland in the second round, never got
started against the Cyclones.
</P>
<P>
   Every time the Bruins attempted an alley-oop, Fizer or Johnson
or someone else was there to intercept it or at least knock it
down. And every time the Cyclones missed a shot, they got at least
two defenders back, stopping the Bruins from getting many
fast-break points.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins (21-11) simply couldn't hit their shots. After
shooting 62.5 percent against Maryland, the Bruins were held to
33.9 percent Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jaron Rush, who had directed UCLA's eight-game winning streak
after returning from a 24-game-NCAA suspension, was held to a
season-low six points, going 0-of-5 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   The Cyclones lost in their previous two games in the final 16,
falling to North Carolina State in 1986 and losing in overtime to
UCLA in 1997. The Cyclones were 0-6 against the Bruins before
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it was all Cyclones. With Iowa State leading 18-16
midway through the first half, the Cyclones used a 9-2 run to take
control.
</P>
<P>
   Fizer and Tinsley each had nine rebounds and the smaller
Cyclones had a 43-34 rebounding edge. Tinsley added 11 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Moiso was the only Bruins player in double figures with
15 points and 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The loss ends the roller-coaster season for UCLA, which saw the
sixth-seeded Bruins go from an 8-2 start to being booed at home
while losing six of seven, to winning game after game to keep their
slim NCAA tournament bid hopes alive. It also knocks the final
Pac-10 team out of the tourney.

<HEADLINE> Gunmen Open Fire at Mexico Hotel  </HEADLINE>
By AMPARO TREJO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Gunmen opened fire at a former federal agent
reportedly accused of having drug ties and three others as they
entered a hotel in Mexico City on Thursday. The agent's bodyguard
was killed, and the agent and two others were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Cuauhtemoc Herrera Suastegui, a former official with the
organized crime unit of the Mexican attorney general's office, was
entering the Imperial Hotel with his bodyguard and two women when
four assailants, two outside and two inside, began to shoot,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The bodyguard, whom officials identified as Sergio Alberto
Chavez, died at the scene. Officials initially said that Herrera
had died.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Mariano Herran Salvatti, who leads the anti-drug
operations of the Mexican attorney general's office, told the
Televisa network in a live interview that Herrera was alive and in
stable condition at a city hospital. The two women also were
hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Six people were detained, including the hotel manager.
Authorities believed a seventh person fled the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Herrera, who resigned from the attorney general's office on Jan.
14, was under investigation for possible links to the powerful
Juarez drug cartel, the daily newspaper La Cronica reported Monday
and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Herran Salvatti was quoted by the newspaper on Thursday as
saying that Herrera had been asked to respond to the allegations
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Herrera was linked to the cartel by the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration, La Cronica reported.
</P>
<P>
   One of the women accompanying Herrera identified herself to
police as a court official from the northern state of Monterrey,
who had come to detain a former commander of the Mexican attorney
general's office. The other was an agent in the anti-drug unit of
the federal attorney general's office, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting comes on the sixth anniversary of the assassination
of Luis Donaldo Colosio, then-presidential candidate for Mexico's
governing party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party.

<HEADLINE> Wisconsin 61, LSU 48  </HEADLINE>
By PETE HERRERA, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Wisconsin is still winning ugly, with
the plodding but productive Badgers beating LSU 61-48 on Thursday
night to make it an all Big-Ten final in the West Regional.
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers (21-13) will meet Purdue (24-9) on Saturday for a
spot in the Final Four. The Boilermakers beat Gonzaga 75-66 in the
other semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with Michigan State's win over Syracuse in the Midwest,
the Big Ten has three teams in the final eight.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Bryant led Wisconsin with 16 points. Stromile Swift and
Jabari Smith each scored 12 for LSU (28-6).
</P>
<P>
   LSU, which used its speed and frontline duo of Swift and Smith
to beat Southeast Missouri State and Texas in the first two rounds,
hit a wall against a Wisconsin team that forced its deliberate,
halfcourt offense and man defense on the frustrated Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   The 48 points were the fewest scored by LSU this season. The
previous low was 57 in a loss to Florida in January.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin scored the final 11 points of the first half to take a
22-14 lead. LSU went scoreless over the final 5:03.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin took twice as many shots as LSU in the first half and
the Tigers had as many turnovers as points. LSU finished with 23
turnovers to Wisconsin's 9.
</P>
<P>
   It got uglier in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   An offensive rebound basket by Lamont Roland got LSU within
26-18, but the Badgers used a 10-0 run to take a 36-18 lead with
13:44 left. Bryant's 3-pointer got the run going and Duany Duany's
3-pointer ended it. Bryant also scored on a layup and Maurice
Linton added a jumper from just inside the arc.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin advanced despite missing 18 of its first 23 shots and
shooting 38 percent. But while the Badgers were having trouble
scoring in the game's first 15 minutes, LSU was having a difficult
time holding onto the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The turnovers also kept the ball away from Swift and Smith, the
Tigers' leading scorers. The pair got off just three shots between
them in the first half and Swift finished with just five shots.
</P>
<P>
   Swift's only attempt in the first half was a 3-pointer for the
game's opening basket at the 17:36 mark.
</P>
<P>
   A 3-pointer by Bryant got Wisconsin's late first-half run
rolling. Mark Vershaw added two free throws, Bryant scored on a
reverse layup, Mike Kelley scored off a steal and finished the half
with a bounce-pass assist to Julian Swartz for a layup with four
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin, which finished sixth in the Big Ten during the
regular season, got into the NCAA tournament with a late-season
run. The Badgers have won 10 of their last 13 games, with the three
losses all to Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin has won three tournament games for the first time
since winning the 1941 national title.
</P>
<P>
   The eighth-seeded Badgers beat Fresno State 66-56 in the first
round and upset top-seeded Arizona 66-59 in the second.

<HEADLINE> Justice Dept. Makes Elian Proposal  </HEADLINE>
By MILDRADE CHERFILS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The Justice Department has asked the Miami
relatives of Elian Gonzalez to agree to a speedy timetable for
their appeal of a federal court decision against them, warning the
agency would move to revoke the 6-year-old's temporary status and
return him to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Roger A. Bernstein, one of several lawyers representing Lazaro
Gonzalez, Elian's great-uncle, said late Thursday in Miami that the
legal team had no immediate comment. The proposal was conveyed in a
Justice Department letter asking for a response by noon Friday, The
Washington Post and The Miami Herald reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno had set no deadline for the boy's
return to his father except to say that she wants it to happen in
an ''orderly, fair and prompt'' manner.
</P>
<P>
   The letter said the Justice Department would ''immediately move
to revoke'' Elian's status in this country if his relatives did not
agree to the expedited timetable, the Post reported, citing
unidentified sources. An agreement could shorten the appeals
process from months to several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Miami's large Cuban-American community, some of them
with walkie-talkies, were keeping close watch on Elian's home and
threatening protests if the U.S. government makes any sudden move
to send the boy back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not calling the people out as long as we see that
Elian's case remains in the courts and the government is not moving
to suddenly take Elian back to Cuba,'' said Ramon Saul Sanchez,
head of the Democracy Movement, a Cuban exile organization. ''We
have used civil disobedience in the past, but only when it's been
absolutely necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez was among 17 exile organization leaders who met to
discuss protest strategy Wednesday, a day after a federal judge
affirmed the U.S. government's decision to send Elian back. The
ruling is being appealed. The leaders urged the Cuban-American
community to remain united and alert.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban-Americans make up more than 700,000 of Miami-Dade County's
2.1 million people. Many harbor deep hatred of Fidel Castro and
have shown their willingness to take to the streets in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez said preserving Elian's rights and maintaining peace in
the community is a delicate balance.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are things we can control and there are certain things
we can't control,'' he said. ''There are very, very deep emotions
involved here and people will react.''
</P>
<P>
   Dagoberto Aviles, 65, reacted to the court ruling by
establishing a watch outside the boy's home, using a walkie-talkie
to communicate with other volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fidel's arms are very long. To do something bad to this child
or family he has to go through us first -- the Cuban community and
the Cuban organizations,'' Aviles said. He did not specify what he
would do if government officials moved in to take the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez said members of his group also monitor the activity
outside the boy's home. ''We also keep in touch with some of the
authorities that help us discern between the rumors and some of the
steps that are being taken,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials have said they want to avoid
traumatizing the boy or provoking a confrontation with Miami's
Cuban exile community. Government lawyers and attorneys for the
Miami relatives met here Wednesday to negotiate a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush, on the
campaign trail in Orlando, said Thursday he thinks Elian's father
should come to the United States to claim his son.
</P>
<P>
   ''The best solution would be to let that boy's daddy come to
America so he can make the decision having taken a great deep
breath of freedom,'' Bush said. ''Let's make sure he's making up
his mind without a repressive government telling him what to think
and how to act.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic candidate, Vice President Al Gore, has said he,
too, wonders whether the boy's father has been allowed to speak his
true wishes when he repeatedly said in Cuba that he wanted to be
reunited on the island with his son.
</P>
<P>
   In January, hundreds of Cuban-Americans protesting against the
government's decision to send Elian back blocked Miami
intersections and cut off access to the Port of Miami, resulting in
dozens of arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is monitoring the
situation,'' Gov. Jeb Bush said. ''We have no expectation of
unrest.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives said the boy is aware of the latest
developments, though they have tried to shelter him from news
reports.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't tell him the details of the courts,'' said Elian's
cousin Georgina Cid Cruz. ''He kind of knows because he sees the
faces. We don't want him to be sad, feel uncomfortable.''

<HEADLINE> Campaign finance bills go to floor debates  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Two bills that would use taxpayer money
to pay for most state-wide political campaigns and put spending
caps on certain races are headed for debate in the General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic-backed House and Senate bills each were approved
by the Finance Committee Thursday on 27-19 party-line votes.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Gov. John G. Rowland has said he will consider
signing a campaign finance reform bill, but only if legislative
races are covered -- a provision missing from the House proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill would set up a voluntary, publicly funded
campaign finance system in 2006. Public money would be available
for candidates running for constitutional offices such as governor,
treasurer and secretary of the state.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would be paid for through a voluntary $5 check-off on
state income tax returns, diverting about $10 million from the
General Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a drop in the bucket for Democracy's sake,'' said Rep.
Demetrios Giannaros, D-Farmington.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans disagreed, and argued that taxpayers shouldn't be
lining candidates' war chests.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's welfare for politicians,'' said Rep. Kevin DelGobbo,
R-Naugatuck. ''Not only is it a diversion of public funds at the
outset ... there is a strong likelihood that we're going to be
coming back and seeking direct appropriations to fund the purposes
of this bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Senate bill, public financing would kick in for the
2002 gubernatorial election, and would start by 2006 for all
constitutional and legislative offices. Residents would be allowed
to donate $5 to the pool that would be used to fund those
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the Senate bill have said it will take 200 years to
raise enough money to publicly fund every campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Both bills would impose spending caps for candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill allows gubernatorial candidates to spend up to
$3.95 million for an election. Candidates running for
constitutional offices could spend as much as $523,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill lets gubernatorial candidates raise $5 million.
Candidates for other statewide offices could collect $750,000.
State senate races would be capped at $105,000 and candidates in
House races could raise $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say spending caps aren't worth considering because
they limit free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ''It costs money to get your message out to voters,'' said Rep.
John McKinney, R-Hartford.

<HEADLINE> Hartford response rate lousy, census says  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The state's capital city has an abysmal
early response rate on the 2000 census, and administrators are
promising a steady press of reminders to fill out the forms.
</P>
<P>
   Hartford's response rate was 5.2 percent, only about a third of
the rate of other large cities in the state.
</P>
<P>
   It's especially disappointing because Hartford's census office
has been open for 18 months, much earlier than offices in other
cities.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we heard the results, it was like doomsday,'' said
recruiter Lorrel Brinkley. ''All that work and just this. ... We
started to come up with new strategies early this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   The census, the national headcount conducted every 10 years,
affects everything from allocations of federal education money to
the number of representatives each state has in the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Census workers will be putting up more posters in both English
and Spanish reminding people to fill out the forms.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Rocks said, reminders will be sent home with school
children in the city. Rocks was meeting Thursday with Mayor Mike
Peters to develop other ways of increasing the response.
</P>
<P>
   Census workers -- called ''enumerators'' -- will be out next month
surveying homes where the forms were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline to return the census forms is April 1.
</P>
<P>
   The response rate was not available for all cities in the state,
but Rocks said Thursday that rates in Bridgeport, New London and
Waterbury-Danbury were around 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Middletown's rate was 20 percent, while the rate in Norwich was
around 16 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Minerva DeLeon, 36, of Hartford, a census clerk, theorized that
some people feel the information sought on the form is too personal
-- income levels, Social Security numbers and so on.
</P>
<P>
   ''They feel, why should the census need to know all this to
count people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's lack of knowledge,'' added Michelle Wallen, another
census clerk. ''People are negative. They don't trust what we tell
them.''

<HEADLINE> Jury told Michael Ross is sick or a faker  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) -- Michael Ross' life could be spared if a
jury believes the serial killer is a sexual sadist.
</P>
<P>
   The nine men and three women in Ross' second penalty hearing
will have to consider whether he suffers from a disorder called
sexual sadism during deliberations which were scheduled to begin
today.
</P>
<P>
   People with the disorder get sexual pleasure out of harming or
humiliating others.
</P>
<P>
   During closing arguments Thursday, Defense lawyer Karen Goodrow
argued the disorder would qualify as a mitigating factor in the
murders of four teen-age girls in eastern Connecticut in the early
1980s. The existence of such a factor would prevent a judge from
imposing a death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a real affliction,'' Goodrow said.
</P>
<P>
   In arguing for capital punishment, the prosecutor emphasized the
especially cruel ways Ross killed the girls. He tried to portray
the Ivy league-educated killer as a clever, intelligent faker who
cooked up a mental defect defense to save his life.
</P>
<P>
   Ross, 40, was convicted in 1987 of six capital felony counts and
was sentenced to die.
</P>
<P>
   The state Supreme Court threw out his death sentence in 1994
because information from a prosecution psychiatrist was withheld
from the defense.
</P>
<P>
   To find that Ross deserves the death penalty, the jury must
decide that the killings were especially cruel, heinous or depraved
and that no factor exists to spare his life.
</P>
<P>
   Goodrow said there was something wrong with Ross from the time
he was a child, arguing he was abused and put on Ritalin. She said
his disorder progressed to the point where he could not control his
actions.
</P>
<P>
   Ross molested neighborhood girls, had violent fantasies,
masturbated frequently and liked pornography. He liked his
girlfriend to pretend during sex that she was being raped, Goodrow
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You see the progression of his behavior. He is unraveling,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ross raped and killed Robyn Stavinsky, 19, in November 1983
after she refused his sexual advances as she was walking along
Route 32 in Norwich.
</P>
<P>
   He kidnapped and killed two 14-year-old friends, April Brunais
and Leslie Shelley, a year later on Easter Sunday as they were
walking home in Jewett City.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, Ross raped and killed Wendy Baribeault, 18,
of Jewett City, whose body was found in the woods under a pile of
stones.
</P>
<P>
   Ross confessed and helped police find some of the bodies, which
Goodrow said shows that he is remorseful -- another factor the jury
could find to spare Ross' life.
</P>
<P>
   In prison, Ross was treated with drugs to help him control
violent sexual fantasies. Numerous psychiatrists have diagnosed him
with sexual sadism.
</P>
<P>
   While in prison, Ross wrote and published numerous articles and
letters and appeared on television to talk about his crimes. That
has given value to his life for people who try to understand crime
and sexual disorders, Goodrow said, another factor that should
spare his life.
</P>
<P>
   But state's attorney Kevin Kane turned these arguments and
writings against Ross.
</P>
<P>
   Kane pointed out that Ross has changed his stories many times --
including a claim that he raped Shelley, although the evidence did
not show it.
</P>
<P>
   Ross' writings also have inflamed the pain of his victims'
families, some of whom listened to all or part of the four-week
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Kane argued that Ross' claims of sexual fantasies cannot be
corroborated, and that Ross has proven by changing his story that
he is not credible.
</P>
<P>
   Ross did not mention violent sexual fantasies to doctors who
examined him after an arrest for assaulting a woman in Ohio, Kane
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kane claimed that Ross, an Ivy League graduate with an IQ of
122, cooked up his defenses as he went along -- first blaming abuse
by his mother, then his parents' divorce, then the breakup with his
girlfriend, and finally sexual sadism.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you really look back at things Ross said and did, the real
progression you see is the progression he went through in who and
what he blamed for his conduct,'' Kane said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Ross is a sexual sadist, that does not excuse the fact
that he is a killer, Kane said. Ross got his sexual pleasure from
assaulting and raping the girls, but he killed them so that they
could not identify him and send him to prison.
</P>
<P>
   Ross admitted to that murder motive 17 times in his confession,
Kane said.
</P>
<P>
   Ross already is serving two life sentences for killing two young
women in Windham County. He has admitted to killing two women in
New York, but has not been prosecuted for those crimes.

<HEADLINE> Man gets 25 years in prison for manslaughter convicted in partydeath  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DANIELSON, Conn. (AP) -- A 20-year-old Plainfield man has been
sentenced to 25 years in prison for the fatal shooting of a
teen-ager outside a house party.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Thompson, who was convicted of manslaughter with a firearm
in the April 18, 1998 death of 17-year-old Rob McCaffery, was
sentenced Thursday in Danielson Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson maintained his innocence in a statement before the
sentence was handed down.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not an angel, but I'm not a bad person,'' Thompson told
Judge Samuel Sferrazza. ''I could not be guilty of such a horrible
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffery's family pleaded for the maximum sentence of 40 years,
claiming Thompson showed no remorse for killing his classmate.
</P>
<P>
   Following the sentencing, Thompson filed a motion for an appeal
and a new attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Arthur Meisler had defended Thompson since his arrest
on April 19, 1998. But Thompson's father, Scott Thompson, said the
family can no longer afford a private attorney and is seeking a
public defender to continue the case.
</P>
<P>
   A group of Thompson's supporters has offered a $10,000 reward
for information proving that someone else committed the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Thompson says a runaway investigation by state police made
his son a second victim of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting occurred after Thompson and his friends were tossed
out of a party. Jared Gilkenson and David Stebbins Jr. originally
told police they saw Thompson with a gun, but later recanted those
statements, saying they were pressured by police.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, Stebbins' sister, Brandy Stebbins testified
that she did not see a gun at the party and the .22-caliber rifle
allegedly used to shoot McCaffery was not in her car when she drove
Thompson, Gilkenson and two other teens to the party.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, police charged Gilkenson, David Stebbins and Brandy
Stebbins, with perjury and hindering prosecution.

<HEADLINE> US Airways Signals Shift in Stance  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a possible strike by flight attendants
looming, US Airways signaled a shift in its negotiating stance
Thursday night, saying it is offering union negotiators
''alternative'' approaches to reaching a settlement that is
competitive with the major airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said its tickets will be honored on other
airlines and Amtrak trains if there is a a shutdown this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our goal is to get an agreement by midnight Friday and we are
singularly focused on that, but in case we do not ... this is one
of the steps we are taking to accommodate our customers needs,'' US
Airways spokesman Rick Weintraub said.
</P>
<P>
   The Association of Flight Attendants is resisting the airline's
proposal to put them under a pay-and-benefits formula based on what
its biggest competitors offer, plus 1 percent. Other unions
representing US Airways workers have accepted the formula, but the
flight attendants say it would result in erosion of their pay and
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ''To be responsive to the Association of Flight Attendants
regarding U.S. Airway's method of calculating parity plus 1
percent, the company ... has offered alternative ways to achieve
its goal of a contract that is cost competitive with the major four
airlines,'' the company said in a statement. The company did not
provide details and union officials were not immediately available
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's sixth largest airline is facing a possible walkout
by flight attendants at 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday unless negotiators,
meeting with federal mediators in Washington, can resolve a
three-year contract dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The Association of Flight Attendants has said its strike tactics
could involve unpredictable work stoppages on high-traffic routes,
surprising passengers as well as management. US Airways officials
say the airline would shut down rather than subject customers to
that uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, flight attendants wearing neon green shirts
practiced walkout drills at Philadelphia International Airport and
Baltimore Washington International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Liz and Stephen Hammond, married and both longtime US Airways
attendants turned out for the Baltimore drill. The couple, who live
in Gainesville, Fla., said they will have no income if there is a
strike and shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a mortgage, we have bills to pay, but we all have to
stand up to management,'' Stephen Hammond said.
</P>
<P>
   Flight attendants also picketed Thursday at Washington's Reagan
National Airport, where many members of Congress catch flights home
for weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., a regular US Airways passenger,
said she sympathizes with the flight attendants, is keeping her
fingers crossed and has not made alternative arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I have to, I can drive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A last-minute agreement or an extension of bargaining could
avert any disruption of weekend travel. President Clinton also
could order a stop to a strike for 60 days and more talks, but the
White House so far has not announced plans to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways said it is making emergency ticket-swapping
arrangements for passengers booked on its weekend flights.
</P>
<P>
   In the event of a shutdown, passengers holding paper tickets for
flights on Saturday, Sunday or Monday could exchange them through
US Airways' other major airlines' or Amtrak ticket agents, or
through a travel agent.
</P>
<P>
   If a shutdown continued into Sunday, the exchange policy would
be extended a day to include Tuesday's flights, a pattern that
would repeat until US Airways resumed operations.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic ticket holders or passengers with frequent-flier
award tickets would need to contact US Airways to change their
reservations.
</P>
<P>
   The only flights that would not be affected by a strike or
shutdown would be regional commuter airlines that operate under a
service agreement with US Airways, using the name US Airways
Express.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways has not announced which of its competitors have
agreed to the swaps, although American, TWA and Southwest have said
they will honor US Airways tickets. The exchanges would be subject
to seating availability.
</P>
<P>
   A US Airways shutdown would hit hardest in the East, where the
airline controls a third of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak officials said Thursday they are preparing to add
passenger coaches to accommodate additional weekend traffic on
Northeastern train routes between Washington, New York and Boston,
and on routes connecting New York and Washington with Southern
cities including Atlanta, Charlotte, Miami, New Orleans, Raleigh,
N.C., and Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   About 10,000 US Airways flight attendants are working under a
contract that expired at the end of 1996 and gave them their last
pay raise, of 4 percent, at the beginning of that year.
</P>
<P>
   The starting salary for US Airways attendants is $17,145 a year,
while those at the top of the pay scale earn $36,918.

<HEADLINE> WHO: Drug-Resistant TB Spreading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Drug-resistant tuberculosis has reached alarming
levels in many parts of the world, and a TB treatment program is
not yet reaching everyone who needs it, the World Health
Organization reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a report timed for release on World TB Day, the WHO said the
appearance of drug-resistant TB has been reduced in areas where
patients are monitored to ensure that they take drugs correctly, in
a program called DOTS.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, TB patients are prescribed a regimen of four
antibiotics for two months, then two antibiotics for two more
months. Resistant strains are likely to emerge if patients don't
get all of the drugs or stop taking them.
</P>
<P>
   Countries with the worst TB problems have started using DOTS --
or directly observed treatment short course -- the WHO report said.
But it isn't reaching everywhere it is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''All, on paper, are adopting DOTS. The problem is that the
majority of these countries have not implemented it throughout the
country,'' Dr. Mario Raviglione, WHO coordinator for bacterial and
viral diseases, told a news conference in London.
</P>
<P>
   About a fifth of TB cases worldwide are now treated by the DOTS
method, Raviglione said, double the proportion a decade ago. Half
of China is now covered by the program, and India has expanded
coverage to 150 million of its 1 billion people, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although tuberculosis is a major health issue in developing
countries, drug-resistant strains of the disease are a global
problem.
</P>
<P>
   One of the worst problems is in Estonia, where drug-resistant TB
accounts for 18 percent of all cases, up from 14 percent in the WHO
report in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In parts of China, India, Mozambique and Russia, more than 3
percent of new TB cases involve drug-resistant strains.
</P>
<P>
   The antibiotics are 99 percent effective in curing nonresistant
TB, the WHO said, and cost $20 per patient in developing countries.
Treating patients with resistant strains is far more expensive, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   At a ministerial conference in Amsterdam, officials called for
fresh funding and resources and an increase in tuberculosis
detection rates to 70 percent by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Health Secretary Donna Shalala opened the conference by
pledging financial and technological assistance from her
government.
</P>
<P>
   ''This global epidemic is more than a health problem, it hinders
economic development and holds the poor in the grip of poverty and
disease,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   India's Health Secretary Shri Javid Chowdhury told The
Associated Press that with an annual 2 million new cases in India
alone, his government cannot keep pace with the costs -- estimated
at $55 million this year.

<HEADLINE> State Dept. Investigating Coelho  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore's campaign chairman,
Tony Coelho, is the subject of a criminal investigation by the
State Department for financial transactions he made in 1998 while
serving as head of the U.S. exhibition at the world's fair in
Portugal, his lawyer said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While commissioner general for the U.S. pavilion at Expo 98 in
Lisbon, Coelho took out a $300,000 personal loan used to build an
8-foot-by-60-foot Portuguese-American memorial wall sculpture, and
formed the Luso-American Wave Foundation to help repay the costs.
</P>
<P>
   The pavilion books carried the costs of the sculpture as a
liability, and a State Department inspector general's report said
taxpayers could be responsible for any unpaid bills. The report
also cited mismanagement of the pavilion by Coelho and his staff.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Brand, Coelho's attorney, said his client repaid much of
the loan ''so there was hardly any benefit to him.'' He said Coelho
had been cooperating fully with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The National Journal reported Thursday that the State Department
inspector general's continuing inquiry is criminal in nature. The
probe is being overseen by the Justice Department's Office of
Public Integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign spokesman Chris Lehane referred all inquiries
about the investigation to Brand.
</P>
<P>
   But he said Coelho, a former Democratic congressman from
California, was ''doing a great job day in and day out, and he's
going to continue to do a great job for the campaign,'' Lehane was
quoted as saying in Friday's editions of The Washington Post.

<HEADLINE> Avalanche 4, Coyotes 2  </HEADLINE>
By MEL REISNER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Joe Sakic scored three goals, including the 400th
of his career, to lead the Colorado Avalanche to a 4-2 victory over
the Phoenix Coyotes on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The win moved Colorado two points ahead of Edmonton for the
Northwest Division lead and sent the slumping Coyotes to their
fifth consecutive loss, and eighth in 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes, who were tied with Dallas for the NHL's best record
at the All-Star break, would fall to eighth in the Western
Conference if they lost at San Jose on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Forsberg also scored for Colorado, and Adam Deadmarsh had
two assists.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix rookie Trevor Letowski had his 17th goal, and Shane Doan
solved Colorado's Marc Denis with 3:32 remaining. But Denis stopped
the Coyotes' 24 other shots.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Essensa had 19 saves for Phoenix in the battle of backup
goalies.
</P>
<P>
   Sakic had two power-play goals early in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   The first extended his season-high scoring streak to 11 games.
It came 2:36 into the game and 37 seconds into a four-minute power
play after Doan was given a double minor for knocking Martin Skoula
to the ice with a high stick.
</P>
<P>
   Sakic's goal trickled between Essensa's legs after a give-and-go
from Deadmarsh.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-six seconds later, Sakic was back in the circle after a
dash up ice, and his shot on the fly again found the net through
the five-hole. It was the 30-year-old center's 25th of the season
and 400th since he entered the NHL in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Sakic got his ninth career hat trick -- and the second this month
-- with 9:48 left.
</P>
<P>
   He retrieved the puck at his blue line after Aaron Miller
knocked a pass from Keith Tkachuk off Jyrki Lumme's stick. Sakic
dashed toward the other end with Tkachuk in pursuit but unable to
catch up, and fired high into the net from the top of the circle.
</P>
<P>
   The third goal gave him a franchise-record 1,049 points, one
more than Peter Stastny, and 22 points during his season-high
11-game scoring streak.
</P>
<P>
   Letowski scored on a crease-crossing pass from Greg Adams 8:22
into the game, but Forsberg dampened the crowd's spirits again with
a double wraparound, circling the net twice before snapping a shot
past Essensa.
</P>
<P>
   That gave the Avs a 3-1 lead with 7:26 left in the first, and
that's where it stayed until Sakic scored again.

<HEADLINE> Michigan State Leads Big Ten Charge  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NICHOLSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michigan State is in familiar territory.
</P>
<P>
   Playing before a partisan crowd in Auburn Hills, Mich., the
Spartans beat Syracuse on Thursday to move within a victory of
their second straight trip to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   If they make it past Iowa State on Saturday in the Midwest
final, the Spartans will be on their way to Indianapolis for a Big
Ten semifinal showdown with either Purdue or Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Sparked by star guard Mateen Cleaves' halftime tirade,
top-seeded Michigan State overcame a 14-point deficit to beat
Syracuse 75-58 on Thursday night in the Midwest semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ''At halftime, I didn't think we were playing hard,'' Cleaves
said. ''I don't mind guys missing shots. I don't mind if things
aren't going right. But if you're not playing hard, then I'm going
to get in your face.''
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State, seeded second in the Midwest, beat UCLA 80-56 in the
second game in Auburn Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're a vast underdog coming up Saturday,'' Cyclones coach
Larry Eustachy said. ''We're playing the best team in the country.
We'll have our hands full. We know what we're up against. We're
going to have to play near perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Purdue and Wisconsin advanced to the West final with victories
in Albuquerque, N.M. Purdue beat Gonzaga 75-66, and Wisconsin
defeated LSU 61-48.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew all year it was a great conference,'' Wisconsin guard
Jon Bryant said. ''It's a gritty conference, a real tough
conference -- great defense and hustle.''
</P>
<P>
   The Big Ten also was the last conference to send three teams to
the final eight, with Michigan, Ohio State and Indiana making it in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State, which trailed by 10 points at halftime, broke a
58-58 tie by scoring 17 straight points over the last 5:54 to put
away Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had to pick up the pieces at halftime when I got to the
locker room,'' coach Tom Izzo said. ''Mateen did most of the
challenging. He did a heck of a job in talking to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Fourth-seeded Syracuse looked ready to run the Spartans (29-7)
right out of The Palace, taking a 14-point lead early in the second
half. But Cleaves, who returned for his senior season with the
express hope of winning a national title, wouldn't let it happen.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves, scoreless in the first half, had 10 points -- most of
them early in the second half -- to get the Spartans rolling. Morris
Peterson had 16 of his 21 points after halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans took the lead for good on Charlie Bell's banker
with 5:18 left, starting the game-ending run. Bell, who had
acupuncture this week on his left knee, scored nine of his 12
points in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Keady, Purdue's 64-year-old coach, is one victory from his
first trip to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't care if I fill my resume out,'' Keady said. ''I've had
a great career. I'd rather make a 20-foot putt against my
buddies.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, one more victory and the sixth-seeded Boilermakers (24-9)
will be headed to Indianapolis, and a shot at the national
championship just a short drive from the Purdue campus.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just amazing to know that we have one more game -- 40
minutes -- and we'll be going home to Indianapolis,'' Purdue's Brian
Cardinal said.
</P>
<P>
   The East and South semifinals are Friday. In the East in
Syracuse, N.Y., Duke faces Florida, and Seton Hall plays Oklahoma
State. In the South, Tulsa faces Miami, and North Carolina plays
Tennessee in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
MIDWEST
Michigan St. 75, Syracuse 58
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans, who also needed a second-half comeback to beat
Utah in the second round, shot 68 percent in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ''They came out in the second half and made some big 3s,'' said
Syracuse guard Jason Hart, who had 11 points and 10 assists. ''We
held them off as long as we could.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen Griffin led Syracuse (26-6) with 14 points.
</P>
<P>
Iowa St. 80, UCLA 56
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Fizer, Stevie Johnson and Michael Nurse had 16 points
each as the Cyclones beat the sixth-seeded Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Jamaal Tinsley added 14 points to help the Cyclones (32-4)
extend their winning streak to 10 games and advance to the final
eight for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Jaron Rush, who directed UCLA's eight-game winning streak after
returning from a 24-game-NCAA suspension, was held to a season-low
six points, going 0-of-5 from 3-point range. The Bruins (21-11)
shot 33.9 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
WEST
Purdue 75, Gonzaga 66
</P>
<P>
   Jaraan Cornell led Purdue with 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Calvary scored 20 points and Axel Dench had 14 for
10th-seeded Gonzaga (26-9). Richie Frahm also had 14, but nearly
all came late in the game. He was 1-for-5 from 3-point range. Matt
Santangelo, like Frahm in his final collegiate game, was 4-for-18
from the field, 1-for-7 on 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything was just a little bit short,'' Santangelo said.
''That's just the way it goes.''
</P>
<P>
Wisconsin 61, LSU 48
</P>
<P>
   Jon Bryant scored 16 points as eighth-seeded Wisconsin held LSU
to a season-low point total.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin (21-13), which upset top-seeded Arizona 66-59 in the
second round, has won 10 of its last 13 games, with the three
losses all to Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   Stromile Swift and Jabari Smith each scored 12 points for LSU
(28-6).

<HEADLINE> Taiwan President Leaves Party Post  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM FOREMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan's president resigned as leader of
the ruling Nationalist Party on Friday, a victim of the
opposition's stunning upset in Taiwan's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. envoy, meanwhile, wrapped up his two-day trip to the
island, praising President-elect Chen Shui-bian for his positive
statements about rival China since his Saturday election victory.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has been concerned that Chen might increase tensions
with Beijing because his party supports Taiwan independence --
something China has said would cause a war. The two sides split
amid civil war in 1949, and Beijing wants to reunify.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been impressed by President-elect Chen's prudent,
positive statements on cross-strait relations since the election,''
said former U.S. congressman Lee Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Nationalist party's humiliating defeat, protesters
have demonstrated outside the Nationalists' headquarters, demanding
that President Lee Teng-hui step down immediately as party
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were many reasons for the election setback, but as the
party chairman, I will shoulder the responsibility,'' Lee, who has
led Taiwan for 12 years, said in a statement, read by a spokesman
after a 30-minute emergency party meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Many expected the Nationalists, one of the world's richest
political parties, to keep their five-decade-long grip on Taiwan's
presidency. But their candidate, Vice President Lien Chan,
struggled to convince voters he could fight rampant corruption and
push through other reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, a former Taipei mayor, won the election, campaigning as a
corruption buster. It was a tremendous victory for Chen's small,
13-year-old Democratic Progressive Party, which was outlawed during
Taiwan's martial law era.
</P>
<P>
   Many disgruntled Nationalist voters suspected that Lee secretly
supported Chen at the end of the campaign, fearing that the Lien
could not defeat the president's hated rival: independent James
Soong, a former Nationalist leader. Soong finished second.
</P>
<P>
   Lien, who placed a distant third, was named the party's acting
chairman. Lee, who resigns as president on May 20, could have
served for about two more years as party leader.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today we will make a new start,'' a confident-looking Lien
said Friday. ''We will push forward reforms immediately. We hope to
bring in new blood, who will bring vitality and new thinking to the
party.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the media dubbed Lee ''Mr. Democracy'' because he
presided over Taiwan's historic democratic reforms, he ruled his
party like an authoritarian. His critics were often forced out or
driven to the margins of the party.
</P>
<P>
   Shelley Rigger, a political science professor at Davidson
College in Davidson, N.C., said that Lee's solid victory in
Taiwan's first direct election in 1996 seemed to have made him
overconfident.
</P>
<P>
   By silencing or forcing out many of his opponents during his
final term, Lee seemed to be only surrounded by supporters
reluctant to point out his mistakes, Rigger said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He lost his grip on reality,'' said Rigger, an expert on
Taiwanese politics.
</P>
<P>
   The irony of Lee's downfall is that the man who was instrumental
in helping him become the party's chairman was also the key player
in his demise.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the Nationalists allow the president to also be
the chairman of the party. But when Lee took over the presidency in
1988 after the death of President Chiang Ching-kuo, many party
leaders opposed allowing a native Taiwanese lead the Nationalists.
The party was controlled by mainlanders who moved to Taiwan when
the communists took over the mainland in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Soong, a mainlander and influential rising party star, helped
rally support for Lee. But the two became estranged. Soong refused
to support Lee's choice of presidential candidate and launched his
own campaign. The Nationalists eventually kicked him out of the
party.
</P>
<P>
   Soong split the Nationalist vote and helped secure the
opposition victory.
</P>
<P>
   News of the unraveling of the powerful Nationalist Party has
attracted as much attention as Chen's meeting with Hamilton, an
unofficial envoy for President Clinton.

Study: World's Oceans Warming
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a broad study of temperature data, dating to the 1950s,
scientists have discovered a significant, even surprising, warming of the
world's oceans. The study provides new evidence that computer models may be on
target when they predict the Earth's warming. Average ocean temperatures have
increased more than expected -- about half a degree Fahrenheit closer to the
surface, and one-tenth of a degree even at depths of up to 10,000 feet. The
findings were reported by scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.

White House E-mails Probe Begins

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department announced Thursday it has opened a
criminal investigation into how the White House failed to review thousands of
e-mails that may have been under subpoena. Lawyers divulged most of Vice
President Al Gore's messages are among the missing. The White House failure to
archive vice presidential e-mails before 1997 means that most of Gore's
electronic correspondence was never reviewed to determine whether some pieces
should be turned over to investigators looking at Democratic fund-raising

Audit: Rural AIDS Funds Lacking
</SUBHEAD>

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government provides more money for AIDS patients in
big cities than it does for those living outside urban areas, even as the number
of rural AIDS cases is rising, federal auditors found. The government spent
$3,081 on every AIDS patient in Atlanta, but only $2,303 each on those living
elsewhere in Georgia, the audit released today said. Atlanta had 6,119 AIDS
patients; the rest of the state had 2,657. Large cities like Atlanta, Chicago

U.S. Sales of Food to Cuba OK'd

government. The sales could not be federally subsidized, and Helms said that
will protect U.S. ''moral and national security interests.'' The Cuba provision
was included in a foreign assistance bill that also authorizes $600 million in
debt relief to developing countries and $300 million in aid for victims of the
African AIDS epidemic.

NASA Test Damages $75M Satellite

   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- A $75 million NASA spacecraft designed to study
solar flares was heavily damaged when engineers mistakenly shook it 10 times
harder than intended during a preflight test. The shaking cracked at least two
of four solar panels on the High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager, and tests
were planned to find internal damage. Launch, which had been scheduled for July,
will be pushed back at least to January. It's the latest embarrassment for the
space agency and Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which last year lost two

<HEADLINE> Mr. Potato Head Greets Visitors  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID RISING, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Meet Rhode Island's official travel
ambassador: Mr. Potato Head.
</P>
<P>
   The plastic spud with the interchangeable features is homegrown,
produced by Pawtucket-based toymaker Hasbro Inc. As part of a
campaign dubbed ''Rhode Island -- The Birthplace of Fun,'' 6-foot
statues of him will greet visitors around the state and ads will be
placed in national magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ''With Mr. Potato Head sprouting up in our communities, Rhode
Island will peel ahead of the crop when it comes to attracting
visitors from around the world,'' Gov. Lincoln Almond said during a
mock swearing-in ceremony Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But what about Idaho, where spuds come in 50-pound bags rather
than 160-pound statues?
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not trying to usurp their territory,'' said Becky Bovell
of the Rhode Island Economic Development Corp.'s tourism division.
''I think that they're safe in that their potatoes are to be
consumed and ours are to be enjoyed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mr. Potato Head statues were designed by local artists with
different themes. The first 20 will go up over several days,
followed by another 20 or more as corporate sponsors sign on.
</P>
<P>
   There's Salty Spud, dressed in orange raingear with a fishing
net in one hand. There's one covered in sand with seaweed hair,
starfish eyes and a mouth of shells. Another wears horn-rimmed
sunglasses and a bikini.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro sponsored one of the statues, donated many of the toys
for giveaways and waived licensing fees for use of the spud's
likeness. The state contributed $200,000 for advertising and other
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign comes at a time when Hasbro is working to make Mr.
Potato Head its corporate symbol. Mr. Potato Head, first made in
1952, was one of Hasbro's first toys and has seen a burst in
popularity from its role in the ''Toy Story'' movies.

<HEADLINE> 'Smart Scalpel' Would Find Cancers  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD BENKE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- A so-called ''smart scalpel'' is being
developed to analyze cells and determine instantly if they're
cancerous, helping patients avoid additional biopsies.
</P>
<P>
   Sandia National Laboratories and the University of New Mexico
medical school are working on the dime-sized, computerized
fiber-optic laser device.
</P>
<P>
   It's not actually a scalpel -- it would be used in conjunction
with a surgeon's scalpel. The device contains a microscopic
spectrometer that analyzes protein density in a cell and a tiny
vacuum that sucks cells through microchip-connected sensors for
analysis during surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Fiber-optics feed the information into a computer to provide
''instant feedback to the surgeon,'' Sandia physicist Paul Gourley
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like an instantaneous lab report on a biopsy,'' Gourley
said by phone from Minneapolis, where he was to present a paper
today before the American Physical Society.
</P>
<P>
   But it likely won't be put to practical use any time soon, said
Dr. LaMar McGinnis, an Atlanta-based senior medical consultant for
the American Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
   ''This sounds very exciting on the surface, but transferring
this from a laboratory situation to a clinical operating room
situation is a long reach,'' he said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''While this could limit the amount of tissue necessary to be
removed and preserve function, and probably increase the quality of
life, it may not improve the cure of cancer unless combined with''
other things, such as chemotherapy and radiation, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Gourley said the device hasn't been tested yet on living tissue,
but researchers have cultured the cells and flowed them through the
device.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Visits India Tech Sector  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT, AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   HYDERABAD, India (AP) -- President Clinton administered a polio
vaccine to a bright-eyed baby girl, visited tuberculosis patients
and told his Indian hosts ''the fight against infectious disease
should be an important part of our partnership with you.''
</P>
<P>
   At a hospital in this developing technology and business center,
Clinton recalled the contributions of Indian scientists and a long
history of cooperation with U.S. researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we can join forces on health, determined again to place
science in the service of humanity, we can defeat these diseases,''
Clinton said Friday at Mahavir Hospital. ''We can give our children
the healthy and hopeful lives they deserve in this new century.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton squeezed the polio vaccine into the mouth of an
8-month-old child named Sandya, who grimaced as her mother held her
before the president. He also spoke briefly with three tuberculosis
patients and watched as a 12-year-old girl, Chaitanya, took the
final pill in her treatment.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Clinton danced with women in a rural village and
lucked out on a safari when he saw a Bengal tiger up close.
</P>
<P>
   The president said that at the request of wildlife experts, he
would issue a plea for preservation of India's endangered tigers
against continued poaching. Twenty of the magnificent animals were
lost last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   After high-level meetings and sightseeing through the week, the
president concludes his Indian trip Friday by visiting a high-tech
center and the financial capital of this struggling country.
</P>
<P>
   The president leaves India with at least one regret: He followed
the advice of White House advisers who, fearing embarrassing
pictures, persuaded him not to ride on a painted elephant. ''I
desperately wanted to ride on an elephant's back,'' Clinton
lamented later. ''I've always wanted to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton avoided a run-in with frisky monkeys by surrendering the
lei he was wearing around his neck. ''Once I was deflowered they
didn't pay attention to me,'' the president said with a laugh. ''I
don't mind these monkeys liking me but I don't want to get 4,700
shots'' if they had bit him.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's final day in India was opening in Hyderabad, a hub of
India's emerging high-tech industry with offices of Microsoft,
Oracle, GE Capital and other American firms. The president was to
visit a local clinic where children are immunized, and then turn
his attention to technology. He ends the day in Bombay, India's
business center, his last stop before visiting Pakistan on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Clinton went to the rural village of Nayla and
heard stories of women battling for higher wages, education for
girls, better social conditions and against forced marriages. One
of their enterprises is a women-run milk cooperative that sells
directly to a dairy, cutting out the middlemen.
</P>
<P>
   ''Awake women of my land. It's time we empowered ourselves,''
they sang in Hindi.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was an edge to those women today,'' Clinton said
admiringly later. ''They had something. It was special. They knew
they'd done something that mattered.''
</P>
<P>
   In courtyard outside a community center, the president joined
the women in a traditional folk dance, trying to match them swaying
and waving their hands. They showered Clinton with yellow and red
flower petals that stuck in his hair and blanketed his shirt. ''It
took me three hours to get them out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's next stop was at a hilltop fortress -- Amber Fort --
which was built by a maharaja in the 16th century. The palace
gateways were built high enough to let elephants pass -- and there
were more than a dozen elephants, all painted in bright pastels,
waiting for the president.
</P>
<P>
   White House chief of staff John Podesta and press secretary Joe
Lockhart counseled Clinton not to take an elephant ride -- but they
did themselves when the media were distracted elsewhere by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   It was at the fort where Clinton ran into the monkeys, who
scamper around the grounds. ''I see these monkeys and they're all
looking at me,'' the president said. He said he realized they
wanted the flowers around his neck, so he obliged.
</P>
<P>
   The president paused to inspect rugs and goods being sold by
craftsmen. A sculptor showed a clay image of the president, topped
with a turban.
</P>
<P>
   From the fort, Clinton flew by helicopter to Ranthambhore
National Forest Reserve, home to deer, crocodiles and other
wildlife, but especially the endangered Bengal tiger. Clinton said
he was told there were 16 in the park.
</P>
<P>
   The president and his daughter Chelsea rode in an open bus that
crept along dusty roadways to a watering hole where they came
across a male tiger. He was sprawled in dry grass, about 20 feet
away, watching the visitors.

Pope To Visit Sea of Galilee
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   KORAZIM, Israel (AP) -- Pope John Paul II's pilgrimage to the Holy Land was
to take a pastoral turn Friday with his journey to the biblical Sea of Galilee,
where he was to celebrate a Mass meant as a joyous echo of Jesus' famous Sermon
on the Mount. The visit to the green hills of the Galilee -- the heartland of
Christ's life and teachings, where the Gospels tell of him performing miracles,
preaching to the multitudes and gathering his disciples to him -- stands in
sharp contrast to the tumult of the pope's past two days in Israel and the

Taiwan President Leaves Party Post

   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan's president resigned as leader of the ruling
Nationalist Party on Friday, a victim of the opposition's stunning upset in
Taiwan's presidential election. A U.S. envoy, meanwhile, wrapped up his two-day
trip to the island, praising President-elect Chen Shui-bian for his positive
statements about rival China since his Saturday election victory. Washington has
been concerned that Chen might increase tensions with Beijing because his party
supports Taiwan independence -- something China has said would cause a war. The
two sides split amid civil war in 1949, and Beijing wants to reunify.

Study: World's Oceans Warming

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a broad study of temperature data, dating to the 1950s,
scientists have discovered a significant, even surprising, warming of the
world's oceans. The study provides new evidence that computer models may be on
target when they predict the Earth's warming. Average ocean temperatures have
increased more than expected -- about half a degree Fahrenheit closer to the
surface, and one-tenth of a degree even at depths of up to 10,000 feet. The
findings were reported by scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.

President Al Gore's messages are among the missing. The White House failure to
archive vice presidential e-mails before 1997 means that most of Gore's

Audit: Rural AIDS Funds Lacking

$3,081 on every AIDS patient in Atlanta, but only $2,303 each on those living
elsewhere in Georgia, the audit released today said. Atlanta had 6,119 AIDS
patients; the rest of the state had 2,657. Large cities like Atlanta, Chicago

will protect U.S. ''moral and national security interests.'' The Cuba provision

<HEADLINE> Pope To Visit Sea of Galilee  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KORAZIM, Israel (AP) -- Pope John Paul II's pilgrimage to the
Holy Land was taking a pastoral turn today with his journey to the
biblical Sea of Galilee, where he was to celebrate a Mass meant as
a joyous echo of Jesus' famous Sermon on the Mount.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of pilgrims, many waving yellow and white
Vatican flags, strumming guitars and singing hymns, converged on
the Mass site, a sprawling open-air clearing carved into a hillside
overlooking the sparkling water.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel my heart is going to burst from happiness,'' said
Mexican pilgrim Rosie Morales, 34, who now lives in Santa Ana,
Calif. She had left her nearby guest house at 3 a.m. to arrive
early and claim a choice spot.
</P>
<P>
   The visit to the green hills of the Galilee -- the heartland of
Christ's life and teachings, where the Gospels tell of him
performing miracles, preaching to the multitudes and gathering his
disciples to him -- stands in sharp contrast to the tumult of the
pope's past two days in Israel and the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
   Since John Paul's arrival Tuesday evening from Jordan, where he
began his weeklong Holy Land pilgrimage, stop after stop on his
itinerary has cast a harsh spotlight on the Middle East's
present-day political convulsions and its peoples' deep historical
wounds.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, in the shadowed halls of Israel's Holocaust
memorial, Yad Vashem, the pope expressed sorrow at Jews' suffering
at the hands of Christians. A day earlier, he visited a gritty,
violence-plagued West Bank refugee camp and offered an unusually
candid papal acknowledgment of Palestinian independence
aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Galilee -- whose evocative landscape is in many places
little changed from biblical times -- the emphasis was shifting to
the intimate sense of spiritual connection the aging pontiff has
said he hopes to achieve by walking in Christ's footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   As throughout the papal visit, security in this northern region
was heavy, with traffic tightly restricted for miles anywhere near
the pope's route. Helicopters clattered overhead as long orderly
lines of pilgrims made their progress along roped-off roadsides
under the watchful eyes of Israeli police.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities had said Thursday night a forecast of hard rain and
high winds could cause delays or even a cancellation of the Mass,
but the skies dawned clear, with white mist rising off the blue
waters of the Galilee.
</P>
<P>
   The site of the Mass, the day's centerpiece event, is the same
rock-strewn hillside where tradition holds that Jesus preached the
Sermon on the Mount, described in one of the best-loved passages of
the New Testament.
</P>
<P>
   In bell-like cadences, the book of Matthew recounts Christ's
teachings on that day, beginning with the famous incantation:
''Blessed are the poor in spirit; for theirs is the kingdom of
heaven. Blessed are they that mourn; for they shall be
comforted...''
</P>
<P>
   Although attended by all ages, the Mass is aimed particularly at
youth, with whom the pope, who turns 80 in May, has sought to forge
a special bond in the course of his 22-year papacy.
</P>
<P>
   At a tent camp set up for pilgrims a few miles from the Mass
site, a babel of languages arose as Croatian, Indian, Italian and
Polish groups prepared to make their predawn journey.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am so excited,'' said Celine Fernandez, a 47-year-old
pilgrim of Portuguese ancestry from Bangalore, India. ''I feel the
need to be close to these places from the Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Mass, a relatively small entourage was to accompany
the pope on visits to two small churches and a shrine nestled along
the lake's rocky shores.
</P>
<P>
   One commemorates the biblical story of Christ feeding more than
5,000 people with only five fishes and two loaves of bread, the
others recall Jesus' admonition to the Apostle Peter to ''feed my
lambs'' -- to care for the Christian flock.
</P>
<P>
   Three Israeli teen-agers from a kibbutz near the Mass site,
selling papal souvenirs on commission, were the only ones who
appeared glum amid the festivities. ''Buttons? Calendars? Key
chains?'' they called out plaintively as pilgrims streamed past.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nice that everyone's so happy,'' said 15-year-old Tamar
Teretz. ''But no one's buying anything.''

<HEADLINE> Chicago Priest Named House Chaplain  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the first time, a Roman Catholic priest
now holds the title of House chaplain, ending a fractious selection
process that embroiled the Republican Party in allegations it was
biased against Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Dennis Hastert on Thursday named the Rev. Daniel
Coughlin, the vicar for priests in the Chicago archdiocese, as
chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert and Republicans have been under fire since late last
year when they announced the selection of the Rev. Charles Wright,
a Presbyterian minister, for the position.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats insisted that a Catholic priest, the Rev. Timothy
O'Brien, was the top choice of a bipartisan selection committee.
Hastert has maintained he was unaware of any ranking.
</P>
<P>
   For four months, the issue raged as some Democrats and Roman
Catholics fired charges of an anti-Catholic bias. GOP strategists
fretted about the impact of such allegations, particularly given
that Catholics make up more than 25 percent of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   In ending the controversy, Hastert accused Democrats of playing
an ''unseemly political game'' by claiming religious bias.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am a patient man,'' said the Illinois Republican, who took
office 15 months ago with a pledge to lower the level of acrimony
in the House. ''But even I did not easily take in stride carelessly
tossed accusations of bigotry.''
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin's appointment seemed to quiet the brouhaha for the time
being. He won bipartisan applause on the House floor, a sharp
contrast to the partisan struggle that prompted Wright to withdraw
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin, who flew to Washington on Thursday and was quickly
sworn in, called his appointment ''terribly unexpected.''
</P>
<P>
   He told reporters the United States stood for ''unity mixed with
diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   William Donohue, president of the 350,000-member Catholic League
for Religious and Civil Rights, said the group had been ''dismayed
by the way Republicans handled this matter'' but ''we have no
interest in fighting this fight any longer and we commend House
Speaker Dennis Hastert for bringing this chapter to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   Deal Hudson, editor and publisher of Crisis, a magazine of
politics, culture and the Catholic church, said Hastert clearly
sent a message to Catholics with the selection of Coughlin, who
hails from largest Catholic diocese in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The selection helps ''refute the notion that somehow Republicans
are country club Protestants who cannot include Catholics within
their ranks,'' Hudson said.
</P>
<P>
   The House has never had a Catholic chaplain; the Senate had one
in 1832 but he was on the job only a year.
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin's duties, in addition to opening each day's session
with prayer, will be to minister to House members and their
families.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, his nomination in limbo for months, met privately with
Hastert in the Capitol on Tuesday and offered to withdraw. In a
letter released by the speaker's office, he referred to the
political controversy. ''Let us be thankful that God is not an
independent, not a Democrat and not a Republican. He is for all of
us,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In a somber speech on the House floor where he retraced the
controversy and responded to critics, Hastert commented that those
charging bias ''don't know me or are maliciously seeking political
advantage by making these accusations.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I have never said and I never believed that there was a bias
involved in the making of this selection,'' House Democratic leader
Dick Gephardt said moments later.
</P>
<P>
   Wright's nomination emerged in October from a bipartisan
committee of lawmakers, but Hastert has the authority to name a
chaplain himself.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Earl Pomeroy, D-N.D., offered a resolution shortly after
Coughlin's nomination that would require that future chaplains be
voted on by the House.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we can do better than this going forward,'' Pomeroy
said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were battered for months by charges of anti-Catholic
bias. The problem worsened after Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the
Republican presidential nominee, visited Bob Jones University, a
South Carolina Christian school, during the South Carolina primary
race.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Jones III, the university's president, has described Roman
Catholicism and Mormonism as ''cults which call themselves
Christian,'' and Arizona Sen. John McCain used the appearance to
hammer Bush.

<HEADLINE> Rain Eases Needs of Okla. Farmers  </HEADLINE>
By AARON COOPER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Some rain has fallen across Oklahoma during
the past week, but it may not be enough to help some of the state's
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you've received the recent rainfall you're doing good,''
said Fred Wyatt, a rancher from Hollister in southwestern Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt hasn't seen a substantial rainfall since last fall. It's
only rained enough to stir up the dust, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some farmers are having to haul water in or dig out their ponds
to compensate for the lack of moisture, Wyatt said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But hopefully, Mother Nature will give us something pretty
quick,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt was able to install about 21 miles of water lines on his
land with the help of a government program.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm one of the fortunate ones. We worked all winter and that
has helped us a bunch,'' he said. ''If they (other farmers) didn't
dig out their pond or do anything, they're in terrible shape.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest report from the Oklahoma Water Resources
Board, east central, south east and south central Oklahoma are
still below normal rainfall levels for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Vance, board hydrologist, said the levels for those
regions are 72 percent, 73 percent and 74 percent of normal,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The rain that has been falling recently is helping those dry
areas out tremendously, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the state Agriculture Department are calling the
rainfall ''a million dollar rain pattern,'' said spokesman Jack
Carson. The rain will undoubtedly help crops that were in danger,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just a real Godsend for our farmers and ranchers,''
Carson said. ''These early rains are extremely important for
agricultural development. There's really not an aspect of
agriculture it didn't affect.''
</P>

<P>
   FARGO, N.D. (AP) -- North Dakota State University researchers are
crossing breeds of small haired sheep with more traditional ones to
produce a larger variety of sheep with hair.
</P>
<P>
   NDSU animal specialist Roger Haugen said the market for wool is
so bad that ranchers pay more to shear the sheep than they get for
wool at the market.
</P>
<P>
   Why not, he reasoned, develop a breed of sheep that produces
hair instead of wool, hair that does not need shearing?
</P>
<P>
   ''The entire sheep industry has changed,'' Haugen said.
''Fifteen years ago, a third of sheep producers' revenue came from
wool.''
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore. Haugen says the change was prompted by the
elimination of federal subsidies for wool. Producers now have
shifted their attention from wool to producing meat, and are
looking for ways to cut costs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   NDSU researchers have mated rams from haired breeds such as
Katahdin and Wiltshire Horn with ewes from traditional Hampshire
and Columbia varieties. The resulting lambs have hair rather than
wool.
</P>
<P>
   Haugen said earlier research suggests it takes three generations
of cross breeding to transfer the no-wool characteristic to
conventional sheep breeds. He said NDSU's program will test that
premise.
</P>
<P>
   Haugen is part of a team of researchers who hope to make haired
sheep available to producers through a combination of artificial
insemination and breeding enough animals to distribute.

<HEADLINE> Pope Holds Three-Faith Gathering  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE COPANS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- What Pope John Paul II had hoped for -- a
dialogue between Jews, Christians and Muslims -- the rabbi and the
sheik couldn't deliver. But the children did, and in harmony.
</P>
<P>
   At the only three-faith gathering during his Holy Land
pilgrimage, the pope held his head in his hands Thursday as he
listened to Israeli Chief Rabbi Meir Lau and then Palestinian Sheik
Taysir Tamimi turn a spiritual meeting into a political debate.
</P>
<P>
   It was the dozens of children from both sides of the disputed
city sitting in the audience and singing between the speeches that
saved the evening. The boy choirs of the three religions stood
together in the end to sing a round of their songs in English,
Hebrew and Arabic, ending in unison with a strong and proud
''Amen!''
</P>
<P>
   Both Lau and Tamimi referred to Jerusalem as the ''eternal
capital'' of their peoples in their speeches, prompting reaction --
some angry, some supportive -- from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   The city is at the heart of the Arab-Israeli conflict -- Israel
captured east Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war, annexing it to
west Jerusalem and proclaiming the city its capital -- while the
Palestinians hope to make the eastern sector of the city the
capital of a future state.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Jewish, Christian and Muslim children and young people
present here are a sign of hope and an incentive for us,'' the pope
said in a prepared speech, after listening to Lau and Tamimi.
</P>
<P>
   Tamimi, whose fiery address included accusations that Israel
continued to oppress the Palestinians, walked out of the gathering
soon after the pope spoke, while the children sang.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders and youths alike from all three religions expressed
displeasure after the meeting that the Jewish and Muslim
representatives sitting in ornate chairs beside John Paul couldn't
get along for the sake of the 79-year-old pontiff.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a problematic provocation by Tamimi but he reminded
us that reality is not as harmonious and wonderful as it appears in
this ceremony,'' said Oded Ezra, 18, an Israeli Jew from Jerusalem
who played drums in the orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ''We managed to get to know each other a bit,'' said Ezra, whose
orchestra met with the Jewish, Muslim and Christian choirs four
times to practice. ''Politics were on the side and there's no
reason why it couldn't stay there. We dealt with music.''
</P>
<P>
   Musicians from the city rarely meet, according to Michael Wolpe,
the Israeli conductor who brought the youths together.
</P>
<P>
   ''This couldn't have happened without this visit,'' Wolpe said,
standing amid a cluster of oboe and violin players warming up
before the ceremony. ''It's the first time a Muslim school opened
its doors for a Jewish musician. I had tried before but there were
always suspicions on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Other youths presented the three religious leaders with poems
and drawings they had created together. The pope smiled warmly when
a Christian girl from Jerusalem, Nadia Awad, bowed when she gave
him the poems.
</P>
<P>
   Even after watching the meeting fall apart, most of the
youngsters were still hopeful. Many had sat alongside members of
other religions in the city for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even if we were Jews, Muslims and Christians, we were all
together in the same room,'' said Palestinian Christian Nour
Mattour, 15, as she left the Notre Dame church complex straddling
the former border dividing the city. ''I felt that I was in good
company, a loving one.''

<HEADLINE> Back to School for Bush and Gore  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The presidential candidates headed back
to school today, one to deepen his understanding of education
policy and the other to show he's learned educational opportunity
is especially important to minorities and the disadvantaged.
</P>
<P>
   The putative Republican nominee, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, was
making a symbolic visit to Little Rock's Central High School, scene
of a 1957 showdown in which nine black students were temporarily
blocked from enrolling despite a desegregation policy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is casting his education plans -- including a threat to take
federal money away from failing schools and let parents spend it on
alternative programs -- as particularly beneficial to minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the expected Democratic nominee, Vice President Al
Gore, was spending the day at L'Anse Creuse Middle School North in
Macomb, Mich., where he planned to help teach an eighth-grade
history class, chat up teachers and have lunch in the cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to show him a normal school day,'' said principal
John Davia. The school twice has been designated as a Michigan Blue
Ribbon school for excellence.
</P>
<P>
   ''School Days'' is what the Gore camp has dubbed as the
Democrat's latest means of reaching out to voters in novel,
attention-getting ways.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president said this week that in order to improve
schools, ''We need to listen to the people where the rubber meets
the road -- the teachers and the principals and the parents and give
them the help by making it a national priority.''
</P>
<P>
   In a head-to-head campaign that is less than two weeks old, Bush
and Gore already are wrestling over the title of Education
Candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Using money from the projected budget surplus, Gore has proposed
spending $115 billion over 10 years to continue President Clinton's
program aimed at reducing class size by providing more money to
hire teachers. So far, about 30,000 have been hired, with a goal of
100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has proposed spending $5.5 billion over five years, but the
cornerstone of his plan is not spending but accountability through
locally designed and administered tests.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the plan to take federal money away from poorly
performing schools, the governor has proposed letting families put
$5,000 per year, per student into tax-free education savings
accounts for K-12 school expenses. Currently the limit is $500 per
year for college expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also plans a series of education announcements next week to
further flesh out his proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The education flurry came a day after the two candidates debated
Social Security policy in an attempt to curry favor with senior
citizens, who reliably vote in powerful numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president alleged that the only way Bush could pay for
his proposed five-year, $483 billion tax cut would be through
massive budget deficits or Social Security cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Any school child could ''go to the blackboard and demonstrate
how his numbers don't add up,'' Gore contended during a visit to
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Bush countered that Gore was naive to think he can save the
program for future retirees simply by throwing money at the Social
Security Trust Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ''People need to ask, 'Who's the reformer in the race, who's
going to bring people together and get something done and who's an
obstacle to reform,''' Bush told students at Colonial High School
in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Education wasn't the only item on today's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   In a matched set of in-your-face events, Bush was holding a
fund-raiser on Clinton's turf in Little Rock aimed at raising about
$250,000. Gore was flying from Michigan to Bush's home state of
Texas for a fund-raiser in Houston.

<HEADLINE> Fencing of Pantheon Angers Romans  </HEADLINE>
By FRANCES D'EMILIO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- The indignities suffered by the Pantheon, that
marvel of ancient Roman architecture and engineering, are legend.
</P>
<P>
   Goths and Byzantines pillaged the temple to the gods in the Dark
Ages. The Barberinis, a Roman family of popes, carted off what
bronze was left to gild Bernini's splendid canopy over the central
altar of St. Peter's Basilica.
</P>
<P>
   Now plans to fence off the Pantheon to protect it from today's
vandals have many debating what's worse -- the curse or the cure.
</P>
<P>
   Should art and architectural treasures be left to be enjoyed as
they are, despite the risks of vandals, thieves and pollution? Or
should they be fenced off, sealed behind bulletproof glass or
hauled off to museums with modern-day copies as stand-ins?
</P>
<P>
   These days, anyone trying to lounge on the broad, low wall
surrounding the Pantheon can't help but bump into the question.
</P>
<P>
   Steel stubs which are to be the base of a 6{-foot-high fence
were recently planted atop the brick wall.
</P>
<P>
   With Italy's cultural caretakers afforded scant funding to pay
for overnight guards, the fence is seen as the only way to keep
unauthorized after-hours visitors from wandering right up to the
sides and back of the soaring brick monument. The fence is expected
to be completed in May at a cost of $425,000.
</P>
<P>
   Since World War II, when dictator Benito Mussolini had a
19th-century iron fence around the Pantheon removed for scrap, the
monument has cohabited with Romans and tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Couples cuddle and kiss on its surrounding walls. Old people
perch there, too, grateful for a place to sit in a city short on
public benches.
</P>
<P>
   But some people are being a bit too intimate with the Pantheon,
whose first foundations date to 27 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Drunks and homeless people sleep or loiter near the monument at
night after the last tourist leaves and the doors to the interior
are locked.
</P>
<P>
   ''They use the Pantheon as if it were a toilet,'' said Francesco
Zurli, the government architect in charge of fencing off the
monument. ''Graffiti is also a problem. We can't afford to have it
washed off every day.''
</P>
<P>
   But fence foes say it would be a shame to restrict access to
Rome's best-preserved monument.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fencing is a moral slap in the face to the people who up
to now have respected'' the Pantheon, said Silvana Rizzo, one of
Rome's most prominent archaeologists.
</P>
<P>
   Citizen groups angered by the move have written to Italy's
president and premier in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Zurli dismisses the protests as ''excessive noise'' and notes
that for a decade, preservationists have been winning out -- piece
by piece -- over those who want monuments left alone.
</P>
<P>
   Ghiberti's sculpted bronze door panels on the Florence Baptistry
were removed to a nearby museum. The four gilded bronze horses that
once graced the facade of St. Mark's Basilica in Venice are now
inside the church. And a copy stands in for a beloved symbol of
Roman antiquity, the equestrian statue of Emperor Marcus Aurelius
on the Capitoline Hill in Rome.

<HEADLINE> Judge Decides Reform Party Control  </HEADLINE>
By KIA SHANT'E BREAUX, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LYNCHBURG, Va. (AP) -- A federal judge who compared a power
struggle within the Reform Party to a divorce said he'll decide
Monday who is in charge of the organization and gets custody of
millions of dollars in federal election funds.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we have here in this case are honorable people who are
divided in beliefs on which way the party should go,'' U.S.
District Judge Norman K. Moon said Thursday at the close of two
days of testimony in the dispute. ''The differences here are that
they can't even compromise without compromising their beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Gargan, who was voted out as party chairman at a raucous
meeting last month in Nashville, Tenn., contends he is the real
leader of the party founded by Texas billionaire Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
   Gargan told Moon the meeting was illegal because proper notice
wasn't given to party members, and some who voted weren't
credentialed as outlined in the party's constitution. Gargan also
testified that the vote should be nullified because he hadn't
called the meeting to order.
</P>
<P>
   ''This basically was a raw power takeover of the party to get
rid of me,'' said Gargan, who was removed by members aligned with
Perot. Gargan is an ally of Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, who
recently severed his ties with the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   Gargan and Pat Choate, who was voted in to replace Gargan, now
run parallel chairmanships, complete with dueling ''official''
party Web sites and rival nominating convention plans.
</P>
<P>
   Each side claims ownership of $2.5 million in federal funds,
most of which is being held by the court. The prevailing side also
is looking forward to the $12.6 million in federal subsidies that
the party's presidential nominee will receive, after its
convention, for the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan, a former Republican running for the Reform Party
nomination, said the party is better off with Choate in charge and
predicted unity by the time of the summer convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''The dust will settle, there will be peace in the valley,''
Buchanan said in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   While the feud has been bitter, Gargan and Choate managed a
parting handshake outside the courthouse Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In closing arguments, Dale Cooter, Choate's attorney, said the
Feb. 12 vote was valid and ''exceedingly fair.'' Cooter painted
Gargan as a tyrant who wanted to rule the party by himself, going
against the executive committee's wishes and overturning its
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Gargan got himself elected and did the functional
equivalent of martial law,'' Cooter said. ''Well, not in this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooter said members were notified of the meeting well in advance
and that those who voted were qualified to do so. He also said the
vice chairman had the power to call the meeting to order if the
chairman was unable or unwilling to.
</P>
<P>
   Cooter suggested Gargan refused to call the meeting to order
because he knew committee members had enough votes to oust him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Gargan's view of the Democratic process is that any
meeting he perceives to be unimportant is illegal,'' Cooter said.
''I believe he testified he made certain decisions because he felt
that was the right thing to do. That notion to me, quite frankly,
is bizarre.''
</P>
<P>
   Gargan's attorney, Tracey Lenox, argued that last month's
proceedings violated both Robert's Rules of Order and the party's
constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nashville didn't follow the spirit or letter of the law and it
wasn't fair, either,'' Lenox said.
</P>
<P>
   Lenox called three witnesses Thursday who testified that some of
the people who voted to oust Gargan were not registered voters of
the Reform Party or were not properly credentialed.
</P>
<P>
   Moon called the feud ''a tragedy'' and said he would not rule on
the basis of which side he felt was more fit to be in charge, but
instead he would do what he felt was fair to both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Moon likened the case to a divorce, saying: ''It shouldn't
happen, but it did.''
</P>
<P>
   He urged both sides to provide him with additional legal backing
for their stances on proper notification of meetings and on the
issue of who may or may not call a meeting to order.

<HEADLINE> Israel Expects Peace Progress  </HEADLINE>
By DAFNA LINZER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Israel expects major, rapid developments in
peace talks with Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinians and hopes to
complete deals with all three by the end of the year, according to
an Israeli Cabinet minister.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration Minister Yuli Tamir said Thursday that the outcome
of a meeting Sunday between President Clinton and Syrian President
Hafez Assad in Switzerland would determine the pace of peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
   Tamir said Israel's government, under Prime Minister Ehud Barak,
is prepared for further territorial concessions to its partners and
would stand by a government decision to end an 18-year military
presence in south Lebanon by July.
</P>
<P>
   On Syria, she said Israel was willing to withdraw from the Golan
Heights and see the strategic plateau demilitarized. She reiterated
Israel's desires for full diplomatic relations and said such a deal
would tackle water issues and likely include ''some sort of arms
package that would further strengthen Israel militarily,'' a
possible security blanket provided by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are ready to pay the price for peace but only if we get all
these things we are looking for,'' she said in an interview with
The Associated Press in New York. ''The Syrians know this and they
know we want a deal with Lebanon too.''
</P>
<P>
   A stumbling block to a settlement has been disagreement over how
much territory Israel will turn over to Syria in exchange for a
promise of peace.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli public opinion has not been overwhelmingly in favor of
returning the Golan, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967
Mideast War, but Tamir believes it would be easily swayed when an
agreement is secured. ''Once people see what's on the table,
they'll say yes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has promised to hold a referendum on any deal.
</P>
<P>
   Before coming to New York for meetings, Tamir spent two days in
Washington, where Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are trying to
work out the framework of a peace agreement to be completed by
September. Negotiations had been fraught with difficulties and
missed deadlines until a breakthrough in the region earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
   She said the Israeli government was prepared for the eventuality
of some kind of Palestinian statehood to be born of negotiations
and that right-wing government ministers who traditionally oppose
the idea were beginning to accept it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Barak recently made it clear in a Cabinet meeting that Israel
will not continue to rule over another people and there was wide
agreement on that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkish lawmakers in Barak's broad coalition government, who
also served in the previous administration of his right-wing
predecessor, opposed concessions then to the Palestinians. Their
views helped bring an early end to Benjamin Netanyahu's government
and paved the way for Barak's election.
</P>
<P>
   ''The important thing is that in this government there is wide
support for some kind of Palestinian state,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has yielded to pressure in the
past and postponed plans several times to declare statehood, but
seems determined to do so by the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> GOP Argued for Foreign Donations  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican Party lawyers argued that
contributions from foreign sources should be considered legal even
as GOP officials were criticizing Democrats for accepting those
contributions, records show.
</P>
<P>
   In a case that escaped much public attention, GOP lawyers
submitted briefs to the Federal Election Commission last year
claiming that the federal ban on foreign contributions applied
solely to donations to candidates, not the unregulated sums known
as soft money that are given to the political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ''Foreign national donations to party committee non-federal
accounts are legally permissible ...,'' the Republican National
Committee's lawyers wrote in a brief in a dispute over a loan from
a foreign businessman. ''It could not be more apparent that ...
Congress intended the proscriptions of the Federal Election
Campaign Act to apply only to 'hard money' contributions.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican officials said lawyers were simply trying to make the
best possible case from the available law and rulings, but did not
believe the loan should have been treated as a foreign donation as
regulators argued.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has always been the policy of the RNC not to accept foreign
national contributions,'' spokesman Mike Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   The quiet reversal left Democrats crying foul.
</P>
<P>
   ''What it looks like they're doing here is selective outrage at
best and utter hypocrisy at worst,'' Democratic National Committee
spokeswoman Jenny Backus said when told of the FEC filings.
</P>
<P>
   The legal filing may complicate the efforts of likely GOP
presidential nominee George W. Bush to make the Democratic
fund-raising scandal an issue in his battle with Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The DNC returned millions of dollars in suspect donations after
the 1996 elections amid allegations that the contributions came
from foreign sources, prompting a Justice Department investigation
that resulted in the convictions of several Democratic
fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Gore have been charged with no wrongdoing,
but the GOP has relentlessly tried to make the vice president's
involvement in the controversy -- including his visit to a Buddhist
temple where illegal donations were made -- an issue in the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''He must think we have amnesia,'' Bush said earlier this month
in lampooning Gore's calls for campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   But the same scandal prompted revelations that Republicans,
shortly before their historic 1994 election victory that gave them
control of Congress, arranged a $2.1 million loan from a Hong Kong
businessman. Former RNC chairman Haley Barbour has defended his
role in arranging the loan.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC's chief lawyer recommended a full-scale investigation
into whether Barbour knew the money came from foreign sources, but
the six-member commission deadlocked along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   Before the case was dropped, the RNC defended Barbour in a
series of legal filings. The GOP's main argument was that the loan
should not be considered a campaign contribution and therefore the
ban on foreign donations was irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   The party's lawyers also argued that if the loan was considered
to be a contribution, then the foreign ban did not apply. The
lawyers said the rule applied only to donations to candidates,
known as hard money, and not to the unregulated contributions to
political parties often referred to as soft money or non-federal
donations.
</P>
<P>
   That's the same argument Attorney General Janet Reno used in
refusing to appoint an independent counsel to investigate the 1996
fund-raising practices, a decision often criticized by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''All donations were deposited into DNC soft money accounts,
which means that they do not fall under the scope of the law, which
plainly prohibits only the solicitation of hard money,'' Reno wrote
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The DNC has gone to court to force the FEC to continue its
investigation of Barbour, and is reveling in the Republicans'
conflicting positions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's ironic for Nicholson and Bush to talk about integrity
when they appear to be speaking out of both sides of their
mouths,'' Backus said.

<HEADLINE> Dorismond shooting becomes hot-button issue in Senate race  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The police shooting of Patrick Dorismond has
taken center stage in New York's race for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The death alone likely would have stirred anger in the city's
minority communities. But Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's release of
Dorismond's sealed juvenile record and his repeated suggestions
that the victim was responsible for his own death have evoked howls
of protest and extended the life of a controversial episode in the
middle of what is expected to be a very close contest.
</P>
<P>
   ''He should be expressing sympathy about the loss of life, and I
think that's the point that the average voter is thinking, 'What's
going on here?''' Steven Cohen, director of the graduate program in
Public Policy and Administration at Columbia University, said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani however has maintained that because the news media is
incapable of covering police shooting cases fairly, it is his duty
to emphasize the point of view of the police.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani campaign manager Bruce Teitelbaum said Thursday that
criticism from U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel, City Comptroller Alan
Hevesi, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and other Democrats is
simply aimed at aiding Hillary Rodham Clinton, the mayor's
Democratic rival for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mrs. Clinton is clearly and shamelessly doing her best to
exploit this incident for partisan political purposes,'' said
Teitelbaum. ''She is joined at the hip with Al Sharpton while she
panders for votes.''
</P>
<P>
   But some Republicans are also wondering what political benefits
lay in Giuliani's refusal to express sympathy for the family or
meet with community members, as he has done during past police
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think she can beat him, but he can beat himself,''
said Rich Bond, former chairman of the Republican National
Committee, who once worked for Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   On March 16, an undercover police officer approached Dorismond,
26, as part of a drug sting and asked if the security guard would
sell him marijuana. A scuffle ensued, backup officers arrived and
one officer's gun went off, killing Dorismond.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth shooting of an unarmed black civilian by
undercover officers in the city in the past 13 months and came a
few weeks after an Albany jury acquitted four white undercover
officers who fired 41 times at Amadou Diallo, killing him
instantly.
</P>
<P>
   After initially cautioning people to withhold judgment about the
Dorismond case, the mayor suddenly launched a withering attack on
Dorismond's character -- including disclosing information about an
arrest when Dorismond was 13 years old that was supposed to be
sealed.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the tide of criticism against Giuliani continued.
Hevesi called the mayor's actions ''inhuman.'' Manhattan Borough
President C. Virginia Fields said the mayor's ''political rhetoric
only demeans and diminishes every New Yorker who is concerned about
a safe and just city.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Rev. Jesse Jackson questioned Giuliani's sanity.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's something that is not well about his response to
unarmed people being shot by police,'' said Jackson. ''This
consistent reaction for the police who shoot unarmed people before
even asking for information, without showing sympathy to the
victims ... that sounds like a disturbed person.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson added: ''There's an ugly consistency, and people are
beginning to see that Mr. Giuliani's reaction to these things is
not just meanness, it's mental.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has used the mayor's reaction to underline one of the
themes of her campaign: That the irritable Giuliani lacks the
temperance to be a U.S. Senator.
</P>
<P>
   ''His actions have aggravated tensions in the city and have
helped drive a wedge between police and the communities they
serve,'' Clinton said this week. ''The mayor's utter failure of
leadership hurts the communities he won't meet with, and the police
who defend the city. If Rudy Giuliani won't represent all New
Yorkers as mayor, how can we trust him to represent the whole state
in the Senate?''
</P>
<P>
   Political observers caution that the issue may encourage large
numbers of African-Americans to go to the polls in November to vote
against Giuliani and that even suburban white voters may be turned
off by the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ''On one hand, you want to look like you've tamed New York
City,'' said Lee Miringoff, director of polling for the Marist
Institute of Public Opinion. ''On the other hand, you don't want it
to look like it has come at too great a cost.''

<HEADLINE> Indian-American Community Develops  </HEADLINE>
By ROBIN McDOWELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Sidewalks are crowded with women clad in vivid
saris. Markets sell spices and basmati rice in bulk. Hindu music
blares from video stores featuring the latest hits from India's
thriving film industry.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Heights, a bustling neighborhood in the New York City
borough of Queens, captures much of the feel of distant Bombay. And
it is not alone: Distinctively Indian communities have planted
roots elsewhere in the United States, from Edison, N.J., to
Berkeley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really exciting,'' says Sreenath Sreenivasan, an
Indian-born professor at Columbia University's journalism school.
''From fashion to media to business, the buzz about South Asia is
at an all-time high right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other Indian-Americans, Sreenivasan hopes the spotlight on
President Clinton's visit to India will also shine on a vibrant
immigrant community that has achieved enormous success in very
little time.
</P>
<P>
   After the Immigration Act of 1965 lifted turn-of-the-century
immigrant quotas meant to protect jobs for Americans, the number of
Indians living in the United States soared from just 5,000 in the
early 1960s to more than 1.2 million in 1997, according to U.S.
Population Reference Bureau figures.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the early immigrants were scientists and engineers,
lured to the United States to fill Cold War demands. Most of them
were also frustrated by social and economic conditions in India
that made it difficult to succeed at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''India had a third-rate economy with too much state
intervention. There were too many hassles,'' says Kanwal Rekhi, 54,
founder of the computer networking company Excelan Inc. and former
chief technology officer at software maker Novell Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Rekhi was one of tens of thousands of Indian-Americans who
settled in California's Silicon Valley. As an executive,
entrepreneur and private investor he's made more than $330 million.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as new arrivals from the Third World, no matter what
their training, skills or experience, Indian-Americans had to prove
themselves ''every step of the way, had to be twice as good to get
ahead,'' Rekhi says.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only way to get to the top was not through promotion but
through entrepreneurship. And many of us risked all we had.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of 1998, Indian-led companies accounted for 24
percent of the high-tech firms in the Silicon Valley, said AnnaLee
Saxenian, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley.
Those companies produced $3.6 million in sales and employed more
than 16,600 people.
</P>
<P>
   Indian-Americans founded such Internet-related powerhouses as
HotMail, Exodus Communications, Junglee and Vision software.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks in part to their achievements in technology, and their
high representation in medicine and academia, Indian-Americans are
the wealthiest immigrant community per capita.
</P>
<P>
   Even using decade-old numbers from the U.S. Census Bureau, their
median family income was $48,320, compared to $33,105 among all
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Naresh Chandra, India's ambassador to the United States, says
the main reason the community has flourished is simple: education.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20,000 Indian immigrants who settled in the United
States since the 1960s are graduates of the Indian Institutes of
Technology -- six elite public universities that are more selective
than Harvard. Admission is solely by national entrance exam, and
only 3 percent of applicants are accepted. Harvard accepts about 10
percent of its applicants.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do not misunderstand. The Indian community also has a lot of
people with very modest means,'' says Frank Wisner, a former U.S.
ambassador to New Delhi. ''If you hail a cab in New York, often you
see that your driver is an Indian Sikh with a turban on his head.''

<HEADLINE> Queen Continues Tour of Australia  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- As Australia tones down a debate about
whether it should ditch the British monarch as head of state, Queen
Elizabeth II today visited the town where a bloody rebellion gave
birth to the country's republican movement 150 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   On the fifth day of her 13th visit to Australia, the queen
toured the former gold mining town of Ballarat, where a group of
rebels swore allegiance to a new Australian flag and fought British
soldiers during a short-lived uprising in 1854.
</P>
<P>
   The battle at the Eureka Stockade still stands as a symbol for
Australia's republicans, who have promised out of courtesy not to
interrupt the queen's visit or use it to further their demand that
the country cut ties with the British monarchy.
</P>
<P>
   The queen's first visit to Australia in eight years is the first
since Australians voted in a referendum in November to retain her
as their head of state.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show most Australians would rather have a homegrown head
of state, but they can't agree on how to pick one.
</P>
<P>
   Also today, the queen and her husband, Prince Philip, visited
Sovereign Hill, a theme park that reconstructs the 1850s gold rush
era in Ballarat, Victoria state, 500 miles southwest of Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   The royal couple passed near, but did not stop, at Eureka Hill,
where the rebels built a stockade to make their last stand.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1854, a group of mostly Irish gold miners, outraged at
an unfair tax system imposed by the British colonial government,
banded together under a new flag, wrote a declaration of
independence and swore an oath ''to fight for our rights and
liberties.''
</P>
<P>
   British troops and police attacked the miners' stockade on Dec.
3. At least 22 rebels and five British officers were killed. More
than a dozen miners were charged with treason.
</P>
<P>
   The battle triggered an intense debate on whether the state of
Victoria should become a republic. In a reflection of how strong
public opinion was, the 13 men charged with treason were acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Eureka stockade is in essence the birth of the republic in
Australia,'' said Anne Beggs Sunter, a lecturer in history at the
University of Ballarat.
</P>
<P>
   Australia was founded in 1788 as a British penal colony. It
became independent in 1901 but retained the queen as head of state.
</P>
<P>
   The queen has been warmly welcomed everywhere she has been so
far on a busy schedule of public appearances and functions, even by
staunch republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I admire the job that she's done, she's an outstanding
woman,'' businesswoman Janet Holmes a Court said after meeting the
queen on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''My views on Australia being a republic are nothing to do with
the queen or Great Britain,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister John Howard, a monarchist, said today that
Australians on both sides of the republican debate had great
affection for the queen.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have always thought that the republican debate really had
nothing to do with people's attitude toward Queen Elizabeth as a
person and that's been borne out by the very warm welcome she's
received,'' Howard said in a radio interview.

<HEADLINE> White House E-mails Probe Begins  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Top White House officials were notified in
1998 of computer problems but didn't tell Congress or the Justice
Department of the glitches that prevented thousands of e-mails from
being searched in response to subpoenas, according to documents and
congressional testimony.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony Thursday to the House Government Reform Committee,
a White House aide acknowledged that he asked that employees keep
quiet about the difficulties, but said he never threatened anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did say ... that this was a matter that I believed that
needed to be kept in bounds with those people who needed the
information to perform repairs to the system,'' Mark Lindsay
testified. Lindsay said he didn't want people ''talking around at
the water cooler.''
</P>
<P>
   Details of the massive problem are only now emerging, while a
Justice Department court filing revealed that prosecutors have
launched a criminal investigation to learn what happened. Many of
the e-mails apparently hidden from congressional and Justice
Department investigators were Vice President Al Gore's messages on
campaign fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Ruff, who was the White House counsel in 1998, and John
Podesta, deputy chief of staff at the time, were told about the
breakdowns in internal memos that year.
</P>
<P>
   ''This memorandum is to advise you of an anomaly in the system
in the Mail2 server, which primarily supports the day-to-day e-mail
traffic of the White House Office ... .'' Podesta was informed by
another presidential aide on June 19, 1998. Podesta is now the
president's chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   In prepared remarks, Beth Nolan, the current White House
counsel, told the House committee that after Ruff and Podesta were
told of the problem, they thought it had not affected law
enforcement and committee's subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thus, as Mr. Ruff understood the technical problem at the
time, he did not think that the error had an effect on previous
searches or that it might affect future searches of e-mail
records,'' Nolan said. ''As a result, Mr. Ruff had no reason to
believe there was any need to notify investigative bodies of this
error.''
</P>
<P>
   Another internal White House memo on Sept. 4, 1998, showed that
computer officials were aware of problems ''regarding OVP (Office
of the Vice President) e-mail and records management.'' The memo
laid out the problem in technical terms, but there was no
indication it was discussed with Gore's staff.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan told the committee, however, ''It appears that much, if
not all'' of Gore's e-mails were not captured by the White House
archive system. But she said officials were reviewing backup tapes
from the vice presidential e-mail system to see if any of them can
be reconstructed.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman James Kennedy said some of the Gore
e-mails may have been found and provided to investigators after
searches of files of officials who sent or received the vice
presidential messages.
</P>
<P>
   The archive failure was ''the sole result of human mistakes and
entirely unintentional,'' Nolan said, explaining that Gore's office
simply used a different e-mail system that until 1997 could not be
archived by the normal White House system.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal investigation will be conducted by the campaign
fund-raising task force which had subpoenaed the e-mails as part of
its overall investigation into fund-raising abuses in the 1996
election.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy spilled into the presidential campaign.
Republican George W. Bush said Thursday, ''This is a White House
that needs to let the sunshine in when it comes to campaign funding
allegations. I look forward to seeing where those e-mails are, and
what was in those e-mails.''
</P>
<P>
   Some private sector contract employees, who were hired by the
White House to work on the e-mail system, contended they were
threatened by White House officials with termination -- and even
prison -- if they told anyone about the breakdown. Those allegations
will be reviewed in the criminal probe, the Justice Department
said.
</P>
<P>
   The department revealed the investigation in papers filed in a
civil lawsuit brought by individuals who contend the White House
improperly obtained and misused their FBI background files. The
plaintiffs sought e-mails related to those files.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department asked a federal judge for more time to
answer that demand, contending any response now could jeopardize
the criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The delay was called a ''ploy'' by Larry Klayman of Judicial
Watch, the conservative legal organization that filed the $90
million class action suit.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not the first time the Clinton-Gore Justice Department
used its campaign finance task force as an excuse to try to take
evidence away from the court,'' Klayman said, adding he would
oppose the delay and seek court sanctions if the deadline is not
met.

<HEADLINE> Purdue Students Riot After NCAA Win  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) -- Police fired tear gas into a crowd
of Purdue students who set bonfires and damaged cars when a
celebration of the school's NCAA tournament win over Gonzaga turned
unruly early Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Three students were arrested during the melee, which began two
blocks south of Purdue's Ross-Ade Stadium at about midnight.
</P>
<P>
   One student suffered minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue beat Gonzaga 75-66 Thursday night to earn a matchup with
Big Ten rival Wisconsin in Saturday's West Regional final.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, a crowd of about 2,500 students walked across
the Purdue campus, causing minor property damage, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers in riot gear fired at least five rounds of tear
gas into the gathering, which quickly dispersed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The crowd was obviously getting unruly. The police acted with
restraint but went (in) at the right time,'' said Joseph Bennett,
Purdue's vice president of university relations.
</P>
<P>
   ''What you are looking for is whether the situation is getting
worse or better, and in this case, it was getting worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The fracas was smaller than one that erupted after Purdue won
the 1999 NCAA women's championship.

Study: World's Oceans Warming
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The oceans have warmed significantly over the past four
decades, providing new evidence that the Earth may be undergoing long-term
climate change, a study by government scientists says. The broad study of
temperature data from the oceans shows average temperatures have increased from
one-tenth to one-half degree, depending on depth since the 1950s, an amount
described as surprising. The findings, reported Thursday by scientists at the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, also may support the findings
of computer climate models that suggest more severe temperature increases than
are shown by actual historic surface temperature readings.

Pope To Visit Sea of Galilee

   KORAZIM, Israel (AP) -- Pope John Paul II's pilgrimage to the Holy Land was
to take a pastoral turn Friday with his journey to the biblical Sea of Galilee,
where he was to celebrate a Mass meant as a joyous echo of Jesus' famous Sermon
on the Mount. The visit to the green hills of the Galilee -- the heartland of
Christ's life and teachings, where the Gospels tell of him performing miracles,
preaching to the multitudes and gathering his disciples to him -- stands in
sharp contrast to the tumult of the pope's past two days in Israel and the
Palestinian territories.

center, Clinton recalled the contributions of Indian scientists and a long

Taiwan's presidential election. A U.S. envoy, meanwhile, wrapped up his two-day
trip to the island, praising President-elect Chen Shui-bian for his positive
statements about rival China since his Saturday election victory. Washington has
been concerned that Chen might increase tensions with Beijing because his party
supports Taiwan independence -- something China has said would cause a war. The
two sides split amid civil war in 1949, and Beijing wants to reunify.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a broad study of temperature data, dating to the 1950s,
scientists have discovered a significant, even surprising, warming of the
world's oceans. The study provides new evidence that computer models may be on
target when they predict the Earth's warming. Average ocean temperatures have
increased more than expected -- about half a degree Fahrenheit closer to the
surface, and one-tenth of a degree even at depths of up to 10,000 feet. The

President Al Gore's messages are among the missing. The White House failure to

<HEADLINE> Killing of gay man will keep other gay youths in closet, activistssay  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In the wake of the murder and dismemberment of a
gay man allegedly at the hands of his stepfather, gay youths will
keep their sexual orientations to themselves for fear their family
members will harm them, activists said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are definitely not going to come out to their parents
because they'll be thinking, 'They are going to try to kill me,'''
Charmaine Francis of Project Reach, an organization that offers
community support to kids, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The dismembered man was positively identified, through dental
X-rays, as Steen Keith Fenrich, 19, said Ellen Borakove,
spokeswoman for the medical examiner's office. The cause of death
had not yet been determined, she added.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a passerby found a human skull, foot bones and other
bone fragments in a plastic container in Alley Pond Park in Queens.
Steen Fenrich's Social Security number was scrawled on the side of
the skull in black marker, along with a racial epithet and a
derogatory term for homosexuals, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The young man's stepfather fatally shot himself Wednesday after
an eight-hour police standoff. John Fenrich Jr., 36, had spent that
time on the roof of his Dix Hills, Long Island home armed with a
handgun and a high-powered rifle.
</P>
<P>
   Fenrich had allegedly incriminated himself after NYPD
investigators told him Tuesday night they believed they had found
his son. On Wednesday, Fenrich called a local cable news station
and said his stepson's dismembered body had been found in a Queens
park; but investigators had not told him the body had been
dismembered.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Police Chief Patrick Timlin, head of the Queens detective
borough, denied a report that John Fenrich had admitted to
investigators that he killed his stepson because he was gay. Timlin
did say there was ''friction'' between Fenrich and his stepson, but
did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, gay activists and lawmakers demanded that the NYPD
and Suffolk County police conduct a thorough investigation to
determine who killed Steen Fenrich.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Tom Duane and City Councilwoman Christine Quinn said
the investigation should be handled by the NYPD's Bias Unit, but so
far, the 111th Detective Squad -- which covers the area where the
remains were found -- will be handling the case, Timlin said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's being investigated as a homicide -- every angle is being
investigated,'' he said. ''That part of his life (being gay) is
being looked into.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Haymes, executive director of the New York City Gay and
Lesbian Anti-Violence Project, said this case demonstrates that
bias against gays does not always come from strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The worst-kept secret in the community is that often much of
the violence gay people, especially gay youth, experience is at
home,'' Haymes said.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 percent of kids living on city streets identified
themselves as lesbians, gay or transgender, while only 10 percent
of the U.S. population identifies themselves as such, Haymes said.
</P>
<P>
   ''So that indicates a disproportionate number of youth who have
chosen to risk their lives on the street because the precipitator
that made them leave their homes was violence from the people who
are there to protect them -- their parents, their guardians, their
siblings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Vazquez-Pacheco, with The Audre Lorde Project, a center
for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people of color, said
the public cannot forget that racism is part of this case. Steen
Fenrich's mother, Wanda, is black. John Fenrich is white.
</P>
<P>
   Vazquez-Pacheco urged police to put in significant resources to
solve the crimes, but doubted that would happen in a case that
involved minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're considered expendable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin McGruder, executive director of Gay Men of African
Descent, said Fenrich's death points out a need for the community
to provide support not only to gay youths, but to their families.
</P>
<P>
   ''This murder should not have happened in the year 2000,''
McGruder said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, NYPD investigators searched the park where
Fenrich's remains were found for more clues, and the scuba unit
searched a nearby lake, Timlin said. The park is near where the
family once lived.
</P>
<P>
   Police used cadaver dogs to search Fenrich's Dix Hills home, but
no evidence was turned up, Timlin said. Fenrich's mother has been
questioned by police, he added.

percent say they don't use a seat belt when they drive.
</P>
<P>
   The findings come from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, which on Thursday released a survey of health behavior
broken down by race and ethnic groups for each state and Puerto
Rico.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers, compiled from 1997 telephone interviews with
134,000 people, highlight continuing disparities between whites and
other racial groups when it comes to factors such as high blood
pressure, obesity and lack of access to medical care.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which contains data on 20 health topics, is the
first time the CDC has put together such a wide range of
information for each state on a comparative basis, said the
report's author, Julie Bolen of the CDC's National Center for
Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first time we've put it all under one cover to
compare states,'' she said. ''It's a good chance for people across
the country to see how they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The report is intended to help state health departments compare
prevention activities and see which are successful. The Clinton
administration wants to eliminate racial and ethnic health
disparities by 2010 in six areas: cancer, cardiovascular disease,
diabetes, HIV and AIDS, immunization and infant mortality.
</P>
<P>
   Bolen said the report should help advance that goal, especially
as non-whites are projected to make up nearly half the U.S.
population by 2050.
</P>
<P>
   The survey topics included Pap tests, seat belt use and
cigarette smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin's per capita drinking rate of 70.4 percent was ahead
of all the states; Puerto Ricans drank the least, 26.6 percent,
followed closely by Utah and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   When drinking was defined as having a drink in the past month,
Utah and Puerto Rico reported the smallest figures. In Maryland,
only 6.3 percent admitted to binge drinking, or having five or more
drinks on a single occasion. That was the lowest binge-drinking
rate in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Texas led the nation in the percentage of uninsured residents;
nearly half of the state's Hispanics -- 44.9 percent -- said they had
no health insurance. Only 6.1 percent of Hawaiians said they had no
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The report found bad news concerning colorectal cancer
screening.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than one-third of adults over 50 reported having completed
a home blood stool test, with 18 percent the median response. Maine
led the country in such screening, with 28.5 percent. Only 9.3
percent of Mississippi residents had performed such a test.
</P>
<P>
   Women in Georgia reported the highest rate of having a Pap test
within the preceding three years -- 92 percent -- while Puerto Ricans
were the lowest at 71.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Georgians copped to being the least physically active, with more
than 51 percent reporting no leisure-time physical activity in the
past month. Utah had the highest activity rate, with only 17.2
percent reporting no physical activity.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC said socioeconomic factors and education levels are
believed to be responsible for the differences between the groups.
People with more education generally have higher-paying jobs and
are then more likely to have health insurance and use the health
care system.
</P>
<P>
   The survey is limited by how honest survey participants were.
For example, obesity rates were calculated based on how tall and
heavy people described themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would guess that plenty of us minimize our weight. I doubt
anybody's going to tell you they weigh more than they do,'' Bolen
said, calling the obesity figures ''conservative estimates.''
</P>
<P>
   The obesity rate was lowest in Colorado at 11.9 percent.

<HEADLINE> Young Pilgrims Wait for Pope  </HEADLINE>
By DINA KRAFT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KORAZIM, Israel (AP) -- Banging on bongo drums, strumming guitars
and dancing in the mud, young pilgrims at the Sea of Galilee waited
in frenzied anticipation of a Mass by Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of young Catholics arrived today for a
spiritual high at the freshwater lake and sloping,
wildflower-speckled hills where Christianity began and Jesus
preached his Sermon on the Mount.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rains lifted overnight, leaving the pilgrims muddy but
strong in spirit. It looked like a scene from a religious rock
concert, starring the aged leader of a billion Catholic believers.
</P>
<P>
   ''He (the pope) will give us the same speech Jesus gave his
Apostles,'' said Maria Franca, 33, from Bari, Italy. ''We are the
sons and daughters of those people and now 2,000 years later he
gives us the same Gospel.''
</P>
<P>
   At daybreak, 18-year-old Elena Ridas of Los Angeles made her way
down the long path toward the Mass site.
</P>
<P>
   The ponytailed, braces-wearing high school student was looking
for inspiration in the pope's words -- words she hoped would steer
her away from a troubled past and the temptation of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is old, but he has been around for many years and is
wise,'' Ridas said. ''I hope that by coming here, my life will
change, that he will help me realize that life in the way I have
been living it does not follow God's path.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridas is part of a movement within the Catholic Church known as
the Neo-Catechumenal Way, formed in the late 1960s as an attempt to
rejuvenate the church, which had begun to lose appeal among the
younger generation as a stodgy institution removed from everyday
life.
</P>
<P>
   About half the young people at the Mass were estimated to be
from the movement, said Father John Howard Wadeson, a priest from
Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Wadeson, wearing a windbreaker over his cassock, said many young
people in attendance had come from broken homes, looking to the
church to give them spiritual guidance.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why go into drugs and sex if the word of God nourishes you?''
he asked.
</P>
<P>
   He looked up the hill toward a group of young Italians, Africans
and Japanese dancing feverishly in a circle and singing of the
return to the Galilee, and said it was proof that God had not
forgotten this generation.
</P>
<P>
   Piles of sleeping bags and backpacks were strewn across the
hillside. Some pilgrims huddled for warmth under blankets as they
sat on plastic sheeting, and others held white candles while
singing hymns.
</P>
<P>
   Many spoke of the pope's powerful personality, and the direct
effect he had on their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't go to church every Sunday -- I'm a lawyer, you know,''
said Arthur Olszewski, 27, from Warsaw, Poland, adding that he had
been moved deeply at a Mass by the pope in Poland last summer. ''I
walk here and listen. You feel something in the air.''

<HEADLINE> Minn. Warns on Financial Privacy  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeing a threat to seniors, Minnesota's
attorney general says he may sue banks that share customers'
financial data with telemarketers that use the information to
aggressively push products on the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hatch, who earlier sued a large bank over data sharing,
also told a public congressional meeting Thursday he might bring
cases against banks under federal racketeering laws for providing
telemarketers with elderly people's private data.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guarantee you there are going to be those lawsuits,'' Hatch
testified at the first public meeting of the bipartisan
Congressional Privacy Caucus, which was formed last month.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing with him was New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer,
who pursued Chase Manhattan Corp. for allegedly improper data
sharing affecting as many as 22 million consumers. In a settlement
reached in January, Chase agreed to stop providing outside
marketers with customers' credit lines and balance information. The
company denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said his lawsuits could be filed against telemarketers and
banks with which they have data-sharing arrangements, in cases
where the marketers ''hustle old folks and take their nest eggs.''
</P>
<P>
   He said marketing companies are using seniors' financial data
from banks to try selling them ''crummy products'' such as
expensive credit card insurance, travel programs that end up
costing consumers money and questionable stock investments.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch is a member of a task force of state attorneys general
that has been investigating whether some of the nation's biggest
banks violated federal law by providing their customers' personal
data to telemarketers selling a range of products.
</P>
<P>
   A federal financial services law enacted in November requires
banks and other financial companies to disclose their privacy
policies to customers. However, Hatch asserted, ''You cannot
disclose to a person with Alzheimer's. It doesn't matter what you
disclose.''
</P>
<P>
   The sweeping new law allows affiliated banks, securities firms
and insurance companies to share customers' personal data with each
other. It gives consumers the right, by written request, to stop
the companies from sharing their data with firms outside the
corporate group, such as telemarketers. However, there is an
exception to that right when, for example, the telemarketer or
other outside firm has an agreement with a bank in the group to
market the bank's own products.
</P>
<P>
   The law ''legitimizes a lot of bad activity,'' Hatch said. Last
year, he settled a lawsuit he filed against U.S. Bancorp, based in
St. Paul, Minn., over its allegedly illegal sharing of customer
data with a telemarketer. U.S. Bancorp, the nation's 13th-largest
bank holding company, admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement, in
which it agreed to pay states and charities $3 million. It also
agreed to stop sharing the information.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota, New York, California and Washington state are pushing
for their own financial privacy laws that would be stronger than
the new federal one.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer expressed skepticism that companies would be able to
police themselves to protect consumers' privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have not risen to that challenge and they have not put in
place the sort of protections we need,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The financial services industry maintains that data sharing
allows companies to offer an array of valuable products and
services to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Banks don't want to sell information that would hurt their
customers to telemarketers and other firms, Julia Johnson, a senior
vice president of Bank One Corp., said Thursday at a forum
sponsored by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-member Privacy Caucus is headed by Sen. Richard Shelby,
R-Ala.; Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev.; Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass.,
and Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas.

<HEADLINE> Bausch &AMP; Lomb Eyes Wesley Jessen  </HEADLINE>
By BEN DOBBIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Bausch &AMP; Lomb Inc. wants to snap up
Illinois-based Wesley Jessen VisionCare Inc. for about $600 million
to gain ground in the color contact lens market. Wesley Jessen
seems to prefer taking its own expansionist route.
</P>
<P>
   Bausch &AMP; Lomb's $34-a-share bid could thwart Wesley Jessen's
acquisition of Ocular Sciences Inc., a rival contact lens maker in
San Francisco. Wesley Jessen of Des Plaines, Ill., said Monday it
had agreed to buy Ocular Sciences for about $18 a share, or $413
million.
</P>
<P>
   Bausch &AMP; Lomb revealed Thursday it was interested in buying
Wesley Jessen, but it doesn't want Ocular Sciences. Its proposed
merger would expand Bausch &AMP; Lomb's contact lens revenues of $475
million in 1999 by more than $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, Wesley Jessen said it remained committed to the
Ocular Sciences buyout but would respond to Bausch &AMP; Lomb's offer
''in an appropriate time frame.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations between Bausch &AMP; Lomb and Wesley Jessen had been
under way for several weeks, Bausch &AMP; Lomb chief executive William
Carpenter said. In a letter to Wesley Jessen CEO Kevin Ryan, he
expressed surprise and regret to hear of the Ocular Sciences deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would ideally hope -- and quite frankly expect -- that Wesley
Jessen would recognize the merit of (Bausch &AMP; Lomb's) deal and
ultimately allow us to sit down and very quickly bring it to
conclusion,'' Carpenter told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   He said Bausch &AMP; Lomb was prepared to make a hostile offer for
Wesley Jessen, taking ''this deal directly to the shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Wesley Jessen has built its success in the contact lens market
by focusing on higher-end products such as cosmetic tinted lenses,
while Bausch &AMP; Lomb has concentrated on premium disposable and
continuous-wear lenses, Carpenter said.
</P>
<P>
   Acquiring Wesley Jessen would ''further broaden Bausch &AMP; Lomb's
portfolio in vision care, which is the deepest in the industry,''
said Douglas Christopher, an analyst with Crowell Weedon &AMP; Co. in
Los Angeles. ''The acquisition makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Bausch had $1.76 billion in sales last year and Wesley Jessen
had $311.7 million in sales.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Bausch &AMP; Lomb moved to consolidate its contact lens
manufacturing operations by phasing out older equipment and cutting
about 850 jobs, or 7 percent of its work force. The company, which
employs about 12,000 people, sold its sunglasses, animal research
and hearing-aid businesses in 1999 to refocus on eye care.

<HEADLINE> GM Faces DirectTV Dilemma  </HEADLINE>
By NOELLE KNOX, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Several seemingly unlikely suitors for General
Motors Corp. are eyeing the automaker these days, seeking to gain
control of the company's DirecTV satellite business.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest media and telecommunications companies covet
DirecTV, which provides wireless television service and high-speed
wireless Internet services. DirecTV is part of Hughes Electronics
Corp., a subsidiary of General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of both General Motors and Hughes shot up Thursday after
a report on CNBC that News Corp. and Liberty Media were considering
a takeover bid for General Motors in an effort to get control of
DirecTV.
</P>
<P>
   News Corp. quickly issued a statement saying the report was
''entirely false and without merit,'' but the unabated market
speculation highlights the fact that GM, which declined comment, is
sitting on a very valuable asset.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hughes fits nicely with many of the other media and
telecommunications companies, but I am of the opinion that GM would
like to keep control of Hughes and doesn't want to let it go,''
said Mike Kagan, portfolio manager of the Salomon Brothers Fund,
which owns 100,000 shares of Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   When GM bought Hughes in 1985, GM controlled about 41 percent of
the U.S. automotive market. GM executives acquired Hughes to help
offset the cyclical troughs of car sales.
</P>
<P>
   They couldn't have guessed that Hughes' satellite business would
someday be on the leading edge of Internet and television
technology. Today, GM's share of the car market has shrunk to 29
percent, and Hughes' market value (more than $60 billion) is
greater than General Motors', the world's largest automaker (about
$54 billion).
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Hughes sold its satellite manufacturing
business to Boeing in order to focus on its fast-growing DirecTV
wireless television service and new Internet ventures.
</P>
<P>
   While analysts would not rule out a bid for General Motors, any
unwanted bid would meet huge opposition. GM has tremendous clout in
Washington as well as on Wall Street, and the company has a strong
labor union.
</P>
<P>
   ''The logistics are quite difficult, and it certainly wouldn't
be done without a fight,'' said Nicholas Lobaccaro, an analyst with
Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Some precedent exists; in 1995, Kirk Kerkorian made a hostile
bid for Chrysler Corp. Kerkorian backed down after an ugly 10-month
battle, though he made Chrysler take action to boost its flagging
stock price.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors, for its part, has tried to unlock the value of
Hughes, which trades as a tracking stock. A tracking stock reflects
the value of a specific corporate line of business.
</P>
<P>
   The auto manufacturer, which holds a controlling stake in
Hughes, recently said it would buyback about $9 billion of GM
shares using Hughes' stock. This would give its shareholders more
of the benefit from Hughes' shares, which have risen 30 percent
this year compared with GM's 12 percent price appreciation.

<HEADLINE> Spring Training Roundup  </HEADLINE>
The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
   There will be no more rumors surrounding Jim Edmonds.
</P>
<P>
   On a busy day at spring training, the Anaheim Angels ended
months of speculation by sending their two-time Gold Glove
outfielder to the St. Louis Cardinals on Thursday for 18-game
winner Kent Bottenfield and second baseman Adam Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, Adrian Beltre signed an extension with Los
Angeles, Al Martin made a difficult return to the San Diego Padres
and Tim Raines retired from the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Starting pitching has been a major question for the Angels, who
lost ace Chuck Finley to the Cleveland Indians via free agency
during the offseason. Bottenfield gives them a proven starter.
</P>
<P>
   ''When it started to become apparent that we might be able to
fill two of our needs, it was such an attractive deal that it just
made a lot of sense to us,'' Angels GM Bill Stoneman said.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield went 18-7 with a 3.97 ERA last season, and made the
NL All-Star team. He entered last year having won just 18 big
league games.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds hit .250 with five homers and 23 RBIs in just 55 games
last season after being sidelined until August while recovering
from surgery on his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you get an opportunity to get a guy of Edmonds' stature,
you can't pass it up,'' Cardinals GM Walt Jocketty said.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre agreed to a $5.05 million, three-year contract with the
Dodgers, ending a three-month dispute and assuring he'll remain as
the team's third baseman.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was my first choice to be here, and I appreciate that I'm
going to stay here,'' Beltre said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement calls for the players association to dismiss the
grievance filed against baseball seeking free agency for Beltre.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Bud Selig ruled in December that the Dodgers signed
Beltre before his 16th birthday in 1994, and fraudulently altered
documents to make the signing appear legal under baseball rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel as if a major cloud has been lifted,'' Dodgers chairman
Bob Daly said.
</P>
<P>
   At Peoria, Ariz., Martin returned to the Padres for the first
time since being jailed Monday night and went 2-for-2 as San Diego
beat Arizona 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, charged with assault in a domestic violence case,
singled to right in the first inning and hit a ground-rule double
to right-center in the third, both off Armando Reynoso, before
leaving the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was good to come out and get back to doing something that
you do naturally,'' Martin said. ''Being around the guys, they were
absolutely great.''
</P>
<P>
   Raines, who stole 807 bases in his 21-year career before being
sidelines with lupus, announced his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess we all have an alarm for when it's time for your
career to end, and I felt like my alarm went off two weeks ago,''
Raines said.
</P>
<P>
   New York got some good news when Ramiro Mendoza threw five
shutout innings as the Yankees snapped a six-game losing streak
with a 2-0 win over the Boston Red Sox in Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza, bidding for the No. 5 spot in the Yankees' rotation,
gave up three hits, struck out three and hit a batter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish I get the opportunity to be the fifth starter,''
Mendoza said. ''If the teams decides to sent me back to the
bullpen, I'll do the best I can.''
</P>
<P>
   In other games:
</P>
<P>
Cardinals 16, Marlins 0
</P>
<P>
   At Jupiter, Fla., Mark McGwire homered in his third consecutive
game and Larry Sutton hit a grand slam for St. Louis. McGwire went
2-for-3, raising his spring average to .382 in 13 games. He has 16
RBIs and has four homers after a slow start.
</P>
<P>
Reds 9, Pirates 7
</P>
<P>
   At Sarasota, Fla., Ken Griffey Jr. hit his sixth spring homer,
hitting a two-run homer in the first off Pete Schourek, who got hit
hard in an important outing for the left-hander.
</P>
<P>
Expos 7, Orioles 1
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Vladimir Guerrero homered twice and
drove in five runs. Rondell White also homered for the Expos, who
have won eight of nine.
</P>
<P>
Dodgers 1, Braves 0, 6{ innings
</P>
<P>
   At Vero Beach, Fla., Kevin Brown pitched six scoreless innings
and Eric Karros hit an RBI double for Los Angeles in the
rain-shortened game. Kevin Millwood pitched five scoreless innings
for Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Indians 7, Devil Rays 5
</P>
<P>
   At St. Petersburg, Fla., Cleveland scored four times in its
final at-bat to overcome a two-run deficit and homers by Greg
Vaughn and Jose Canseco.
</P>
<P>
Twins 4, Rangers 2
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Myers, Fla., Sean Bergman allowed two hits in five
scoreless innings, and Butch Huskey hit a two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
Astros 4, Mets 1
</P>
<P>
   At Port St. Lucie, Fla., Houston scored three runs off Al Leiter
after a dropped third strike as the Mets lost their final game
before heading to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Royals 10, Tigers 4
</P>
<P>
   At Haines City, Fla., reliever Jerry Spradlin retired all 10
batters he faced in Kansas City's win.
</P>
<P>
Rockies 6, Angels (ss) 3
</P>
<P>
   At Tucson, Ariz., utilityman Terry Shumpert homered and drove in
two runs for Colorado. After starting in left field Wednesday,
Shumpert played third base, shortstop and second base against
Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
Brewers 9, Athletics (ss) 5
</P>
<P>
   At Phoenix, Sean Berry homered twice to match his total from
last season, and Jeromy Burnitz drove in five runs.
</P>
<P>
Mariners 7, Cubs 4
</P>
<P>
   At Mesa, Ariz., Mike Cameron went 2-for-3 with two stolen bases,
and Carlos Hernandez and John Olerud had two RBIs apiece.
</P>
<P>
White Sox 9, Giants 7
</P>
<P>
   At Tucson, Ariz., Magglio Ordonez set a team record with his
eighth spring training homer. Ordonez went 3-for-4 and drove in
three runs.
</P>
<P>
Athletics (ss) 9, Angels (ss) 4
</P>
<P>
   At Tempe, Ariz., Tom Candiotti allowed seven earned runs and
gave up three homers in four-plus innings, putting his spot in
Anaheim's rotation in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
Blue Jays 4, Phillies 1
</P>
<P>
   At Clearwater, Fla., Randy Wolf, whose readiness to start the
season in the big leagues was questioned less than a week ago,
allowed one hit in five scoreless innings, but Philadelphia lost
because of Wayne Gomes' throwing error in the eighth inning.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Before the players on the Chicago Cubs and
New York Mets made it to the majors, they were minor leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't have chartered flights back then. They traveled in
buses, driving for hours on end to games in small towns. Sometimes
the air conditioning worked, sometimes it didn't. Ditto for the
bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   So while a 13- or 17-hour flight to Japan might be a little
tedious, it could be a lot worse.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hey, at least the plane will have air conditioning and a
bathroom,'' said Mike Hampton, the Mets' opening-day starter.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs and Mets left today for next Wednesday's season opener
in Japan, a first for major league baseball. The Mets flew from
their spring training site in Port Lucie, Fla., to Chicago, where
they boarded a commercial flight to Tokyo. The Cubs flew from
Arizona to San Francisco and then on to Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   By the time they arrive in Japan, it will be Saturday night, and
the teams will have flown a total of about 13,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the flight, you look out and see the sun, then you might
sleep and wake up and look out and see the sun. Then you eat and
look out and see the sun,'' said Mets manager Bobby Valentine,
who's flown to Japan and back 10 times.
</P>
<P>
   ''It just follows you all the way across. It's weird.''
</P>
<P>
   Both teams have been preparing for the flight since they got to
spring training. Players have been guzzling extra water to make
sure they stay hydrated on the long flights. The Mets set a few
clocks in their clubhouse to Tokyo time so players would have a
better idea of the time difference.
</P>
<P>
   Leon Lee, the Cubs' Pacific Rim coordinator, has been playing
part-travel agent, part-Dear Abby since training camp began. Lee
played in Japan for 10 years and has spent the last 12 years
scouting or working there, so he knows the country almost as well
as a native.
</P>
<P>
   He's been asked everything from what credit cards are used in
Japan to where is the best place to buy pearls. And he's sure the
players will have even more questions once they arrive.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tokyo really is so Westernized, it's not like it was years
ago. But I enjoy it,'' Lee said. ''Any kind of food you want to
eat. It's very metropolitan, international, and you meet people
from all over the world. A very progressive city, it's very
interesting.
</P>
<P>
   ''For a lot of these guys, it will be a once-in-a-lifetime
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   And not necessarily just for the players. Many are taking their
families with them. Hampton is bringing his wife, mother, sister
and brother along.
</P>
<P>
   ''My dad's not too keen on that flying stuff,'' Hampton said.
''He said if he could drive there, he'd go.''
</P>
<P>
   Interesting as it might be, though, this is still a business
trip. The teams will have news conferences when they arrive
Saturday night, and short workouts Sunday. They will play
exhibition games against the Seibu Lions and Tokyo Giants on Monday
and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on Wednesday, the season begins. The Cubs and Mets will
play at 7 p.m. Tokyo time -- 5 a.m. in New York and 4 a.m. in
Chicago. They'll play another game Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, March 31, they'll get back on the plane, go home and
get ready for the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''The biggest adjustment is when you get back,'' said Cubs first
baseman Mark Grace, who played on an All-Star tour in Japan in
1992. ''That'll be where we have to find out what we're about.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets open a six-game homestand April 3 against San Diego,
have off the next day, and then play two more against the Padres
before the Los Angeles Dodgers come to town. The Mets then leave on
a six-game road trip.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs will have the weekend off when they get back and then
travel to St. Louis for a game April 3. They'll have off Tuesday,
and then play two more against the Cardinals before traveling to
Cincinnati for a three-game series against the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Then it's back to Wrigley Field for the home opener on April 9.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line? Winning,'' Grace said. ''We're not going over
there just to see the sights. I'm not going there to meet their
hierarchy. I'm going there to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Grace said he would be very upset ''if we come back on a 17-hour
flight with an 0-2 record.''

<HEADLINE> Oklahoma Sees UConn in Human Terms  </HEADLINE>
By CHUCK SCHOFFNER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   With two first-team All-Americans and flashy offense,
Connecticut can be downright scary. The Huskies are deep and
talented, they run and press with abandon, and most of their games
are blowouts.
</P>
<P>
   At times, they can seem larger than life -- but not to Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma plays top-seeded Connecticut on Saturday in the NCAA
women's Mideast Regional at Richmond, Va., their second meeting of
the season. UConn beat OU 84-68 in Norman, Okla., on Dec. 29, a
game that left the Sooners beaten, but not in awe.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing the Huskies up close, some of the mystique has worn
off.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes they turn it over, just like we do,'' Oklahoma coach
Sherri Coale said. ''Sometimes they blow layups. Sometimes they
foul, just like we do. They're very good basketball players and
they're an exceptional team, but they're human.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth-seeded Sooners (25-7) shared the Big 12 championship
with Iowa State and Texas Tech, both also still alive in NCAA play,
then lost to Texas in their first game at the conference
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Big 12 player of the year Phylesha Whaley, Oklahoma
regrouped quickly, beating Brigham Young in the first round of the
NCAA tournament, then knocking off fourth-seeded Purdue on the
Boilermakers' floor to advance to the round of 16.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are a wiser team than the one that went to Kansas City and
lost to Texas,'' Coale said. ''I don't think we would have beaten
Purdue had we not endured what happened to us in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's why you play games, to find out what you're not very
good at. Then you go home and fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma is one of just three underdogs to survive the first two
rounds. Fifth-seeded North Carolina and 11th-seeded
Alabama-Birmingham are still playing in the West Regional.
Otherwise, it's a field of favorites, with all of the Nos. 1 and 2
seeds still playing.
</P>
<P>
   A long day of regional play starts Saturday morning, with
second-seeded Duke (28-5) meeting third-seeded LSU (24-6) in the
other game at Richmond. In the Mideast Regional at Memphis,
top-seeded Tennessee (29-3) plays fourth-seeded Virginia (25-8) and
second-seeded Notre Dame (27-4) faces third-seeded Texas Tech
(27-4).
</P>
<P>
   The Midwest Regional is in Kansas City, where top-seeded
Louisiana Tech (30-2) will try extend coach Leon Barmore's career
again in a game with fourth-seeded Old Dominion (29-4). Barmore
will retire after Tech's final game. Second-seeded Penn State
(28-4) plays third-seeded Iowa State (27-5) in the other Midwest
semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   In the West at Portland, Ore, it's top-seeded Georgia (31-3)
against North Carolina (20-12) and Alabama-Birmingham (21-12)
against second-seeded Rutgers (24-7). The regional finals are
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut (32-1) won its first two NCAA games by 71 and 38
points and enter this round much more confident than a year ago.
Frustrated by injuries and sporadic point guard play, the
top-seeded Huskies beat Xavier by just two points in the second
round last year, then lost to Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Sue Bird has been outstanding at the point and
knows just when and where to get the ball to All-Americans Shea
Ralph and Svetlana Abrosimova.
</P>
<P>
   ''This team is really focused right now,'' coach Geno Auriemma
said. ''I can't say I've had anything to complain about.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Tech has no complaints about its matchup with Notre Dame
because the Lady Raiders have a score to settle with the Irish.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Texas Tech was the No. 1 seed in the Midwest when
they lost to ninth-seeded Notre Dame at home in the second round.
That prevented Tech from advancing to the regional semifinals, also
on its own floor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any time anyone beats us, we've always got revenge on our
mind,'' Tech's Keitha Dickerson said.
</P>
<P>
   Duke has reached the regional semifinals for the third straight
season after losing three starters from the team that was beaten by
Purdue in the national championship game last year. The Blue Devils
were further depleted when one of the two returnees, Peppi Browne,
was sidelined by a season-ending knee injury in late January.
</P>
<P>
   But veteran Georgia Schweitzer has kept Duke on a steady course,
and players such as Rochelle Parent, Lauren Rice and freshman
Sheana Mosch are making valuable contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ''This shows what happens when everyone pulls together and is
willing to do their part,'' Duke coach Gail Goestenkors said.
''This is the perfect example of what can be done when no one cares
who gets the points or recognition.''

<HEADLINE> Webb Leads Nabisco by One Shot  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. (AP) -- Beth Daniel knows what's it like to
be as confident and successful as Karrie Webb. In 1990, Daniel won
seven tournaments to dominate the LPGA Tour the way Webb is now.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought I could win every tournament that I entered that
year,'' Daniel said. ''When I got on the leader board, I actually
felt like people sometimes got intimidated a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Daniel's seven victories was her only title in a major,
the LPGA Championship. A decade later, on the verge of being
inducted into the tour's Hall of Fame, she's has a chance for her
second major.
</P>
<P>
   But Webb stands in the way.
</P>
<P>
   Webb used five birdies to shoot a 5-under 67 and take a 1-shot
lead over defending champion Dottie Pepper in Thursday's opening
round of the Nabisco Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm in some sort of zone,'' said Webb, who has three LPGA
victories and another non-tour win this season. ''I have a lot of
belief in my game right now. It was just good to see some good iron
shots and some putts go in.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepper birdied three of the final four holes for a 68 and was
one of four players within three shots of Webb. Pepper shot a
tournament-record 19-under 269 to win by six strokes last year.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel, who will enter the Hall of Fame next month, and Barb
Whitehead, whose only tour victory was five years ago, each shot
70.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel considers Webb's success even more amazing because she
doesn't believe the Australian is playing that well.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's driving the ball really well, but I don't think she's
hitting her irons as well as she's capable of hitting them,''
Daniel said. ''On an off day, her confidence can carry her through
because she feels like she should be at the top right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb's bid to become the first golfer in 22 years to win four
consecutive LPGA tournaments ended with a second-place finish last
week at Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't expect to play well all the time,'' she said. ''I know
there's going to be bad days and I just have to try and make them
as good as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Hetherington, a two-time winner in the last 14 months, is
third with a 69. She and Webb were frequent competitors as juniors
in their native Queensland, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've known her for so long that I don't feel intimidated by
her game or the way she plays,'' Hetherington said. ''If anything,
it helps you because you've got to improve your game and raise it
to another level to be competitive out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepper agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as you see a good number up there, you know the golf
course can give something up,'' she said of Webb's leading score.
''Certainly it helps not to dig yourself a hole, but she's human,
too, and she's not finished tournaments so strongly and other
people have.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb hit 16 greens on the 6,520-yard, par-72 Dinah Shore course
at Mission Hills Country Club under sunny, warm and relatively calm
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   She went home Wednesday unhappy with the way she played in the
two-day pro-am, and showed up early Thursday to practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''The confidence is a big thing for me right now. On the first
tee, everything that happened the past two days pretty much
vanished,'' she said. ''I hit a good swing on my first drive, hit
the middle of the fairway and never looked back from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb's trickiest moment came on the par-4, 385-yard 12th.
</P>
<P>
   Her second shot hit a tree branch on the left side of the
fairway, then bounced across and hit the base of a tree before
coming to rest back in the fairway. Unruffled, she landed her third
shot 12 feet from the pin and salvaged a par.
</P>
<P>
   ''Someone who's not working with a lot of confidence might not
get it up and down there,'' she said. ''I didn't put myself into
danger of making too many mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Davies led five players at 71. Amateur Beth Bauer, a
sophomore at Duke, was one of five players at par-72.
</P>
<P>
   Swede Annika Sorenstam stumbled to a 4-over 76 that included a
double-bogey on the par-3, 164-yard fifth, where she hit her tee
shot into the water. She played the front nine 4-over, but came
back at even-par.
</P>
<P>
   Aree and Naree Song Wongluekiet, the 13-year-old twin sisters
from Thailand who are the second-youngest ever to play in an LPGA
tournament, shot better than Juli Inkster and Nancy Lopez. Naree
had a 74 and Aree shot 75. Each sister played the back nine in even
par.
</P>
<P>
   Several big names struggled in the favorable conditions. Se Ri
Pak had a 73; Meg Mallon finished with a 75; Inkster, a two-time
Nabisco winner, had a 76; and Lopez, who won in 1981, struggled to
a 78.
</P>
<P>
Divots: Sorenstam played Tuesday's pro-am with singer Celine Dion,
an avid golfer with an 18-handicap. ... Daniel is planning a big
party in Charleston, S.C., as part of her Hall of Fame induction
April 1. At least eight Hall of Fame members will be there to enjoy
a menu that includes a local favorite, she-crab soup.

<HEADLINE> Congressional Republicans attack first lady's travel costs  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Republicans railed against
Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign travel expenses, releasing
documents showing she has paid back only about one-fifth of the
costs of her trips to New York on government jets.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats chalked up a Capitol Hill hearing on the first
lady's travel as a ploy to embarrass her.
</P>
<P>
   The 26 trips Clinton took between June 9 and Dec. 14, 1999, cost
$182,471. She has reimbursed taxpayers $32,878, according to the
documents. House Republicans compiled the information using White
House documents.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton flies on government aircraft on the advice of Secret
Service and reimburses the government the same way presidential
candidates do: at the rate of a first-class commercial ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The practice, though legal, has been criticized by her
Republican rival for the Senate, New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, who says Mrs. Clinton should reimburse all the money.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's amazing that Mrs. Clinton has only reimbursed the
taxpayers a little over $30,000. Something is clearly wrong,''
Giuliani campaign spokeswoman Kim Serafin said.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said policies regarding the
first lady's travel on military planes date to the 1980s. He handed
out memos signed by former Republican chiefs of staff James Baker
and John Sununu endorsing the policy.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing by the House subcommittee that oversees the White
House budget, Republicans said the laws governing White House
travel were never intended to cover a political campaign by a first
lady.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in new waters and charting new territory here today,''
said Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., and the subcommittee chairman. ''It
is unprecedented for a first lady to use government aircraft for
her own political purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats assailed the hearing as an extension of the Giuliani
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a political hearing, make no mistake about it,'' said
Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md. ''We're here to score political points.''
</P>
<P>
   As evidence, they pointed out the hearing was announced
Wednesday by the Republican National Committee, which had claimed
the first lady's taxpayer-funded travel expenses topped $900,000.
</P>
<P>
   RNC staffers stood by the higher figure Thursday. They said the
subcommittee had not been given all the pertinent data by the White
House. During the hearing, RNC officials distributed their own
tally, which included trips taken on Air Force One with the
president.
</P>
<P>
   While the White House supplied information on the travel dates
and who was on the flight, it did not provide costs. Republicans
estimated those based on the $3,705 per hour the Air Force says it
costs to fly a C-20. Republicans said that aircraft is less
expensive to fly than the C-9, which the first lady is believed to
use on occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Peterson, R-Pa., urged the White House to release the
first lady's travel costs and reimbursements on a monthly basis.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lyle, White House director of office administration,
said that would be ''burdensome'' and was unnecessary because Mrs.
Clinton has followed all laws and regulations involving travel.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's campaign spokesman, Howard Wolfson, claimed the
hearing was an attempt by Republicans to deflect attention from
Giuliani's response to last week's fatal shooting of an unarmed
black man by New York police.
</P>
<P>
   ''The real issue in this campaign is Rudy Giuliani's
irresponsible rush to judgment'' in the case, Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who has stood by the officers, ordered the release of
the dead man's police record, showing a sealed juvenile charge that
later was dropped and two guilty pleas to disorderly conduct in the
mid-1990s.

<HEADLINE> For a jury, judge converts porn star into a dancer, model andactress  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A judge has cleaned up the act of an X-rated
movie star for the upcoming insider trading trial of a top Wall
Street executive.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood ruled Thursday that Kathryn
Gannon will be acknowledged only as a dancer, model and actress
whose stage name was ''Marylin Star'' rather than as a sex queen in
porn films.
</P>
<P>
   Wood rejected attempts by prosecutors to expose more about
Gannon, a fugitive in a case whose primary defendant is James
McDermott Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Wood made various rulings during a pre-trial hearing Thursday
about what evidence can be shown to the jury at a trial scheduled
to start April 10 in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Her rulings appeared to weaken the government's case against
McDermott, the former chief executive officer at Keefe, Bruyette &AMP;
Woods, and a co-defendant, Anthony P. Pomponio.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had said it was crucial to their case to tell jurors
about Gannon's profession.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney James J. Benjamin Jr. also said it was
''absolutely essential'' to tell how the insider trading caused the
cancellation of an initial public offering by McDermott's company.
</P>
<P>
   Wood said she thought evidence about the public offering would
be confusing for the jury and time consuming but left the door open
to change her mind.
</P>
<P>
   She was unyielding to prosecutors, though, on the issue of what
could be said about Gannon's career, making it unlikely that the
jury will ever learn that Pomponio said in a statement that he
believed Gannon was a prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for McDermott had successfully argued to the judge that
Gannon's career was largely irrelevant to whether she conspired
with McDermott and Pomponio to cheat in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had wanted at least to refer to Gannon as an
''exotic'' dancer and as an ''adult'' film actress. But Wood ruled
that neither of the words would be used in front of the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say McDermott told Gannon about obscure regional
banks that were involved in mergers and acquisitions prior to
public announcements, allowing the trio to gain $170,000 in illegal
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said in court papers and a letter to the judge that
Gannon's profession was crucial to their case because her job
''raises the strong inference that McDermott paid her for sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said they plan to tell the jury that Gannon's
intimate sexual relationship with McDermott was the principal
motive for his crime.
</P>
<P>
   Wood blocked them from their plans to use her status as an adult
film actress to imply that McDermott needed to impress her by
providing inside stock tips.
</P>
<P>
   Wood said the nature of Gannon's profession was irrelevant
because it was possible for prosecutors to show there was a sexual
affair between Gannon and McDermott without revealing her
occupation.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, who herself trained briefly as a Playboy Club bunny
in the 1960s, had said at an earlier hearing that she worried that
some jurors might hear Gannon's profession and think the defendants
were ''sleazy.''
</P>
<P>
   McDermott, 48, of Briarcliff Manor is charged along with
Pomponio, 45, of North Caldwell, N.J., and Gannon, 30, of Miami,
Fla., with conspiracy and securities fraud.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott and Pomponio, who have both pleaded innocent, remain
free on bail. Prosecutors are seeking Gannon's extradition from
Canada.

<HEADLINE> Army Replaced Patriot Missiles  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army says it cannot predict how long it
will take to find the cause of a Patriot missile glitch that
prompted it to hurriedly replace hundreds of them in the Mideast
and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriot, which gained fame in 1991 in its combat debut
against Iraqi Scud missiles fired on Saudi Arabia and Israel, is a
key to the defense of U.S. and allied forces in the Gulf and on the
Korean Peninsula. Patriots in the Gulf and in South Korea are kept
on high alert because of short warning times.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Paul Kern, a senior Army acquisitions officer, said
Thursday that the decision to quietly replace the missiles with
newer ones was made about 10 days ago and the swap-out was
completed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think we have a pretty good handle on the components that
are failing, but we have not confirmed the cause of that yet,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   None of the seven foreign countries that operate U.S.-made
Patriot missile batteries was told about the problem until this
week, Kern said. ''I don't think any of them are angry about the
situation,'' he said. ''They are concerned, probably, the same as
we are, that we find solutions to the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why Israel, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the Netherlands,
Germany, Japan and Taiwan were not told about the possible
vulnerability of their Patriot missiles, Kern replied: ''We did
what we thought was a very fair assessment of keeping the security
of our forces and or allies in check, and we think we did it the
right way.''
</P>
<P>
   The technical problem, as described by Kern, appears related to
the way in which the Patriots are used.
</P>
<P>
   Testing has shown that those kept constantly on high alert --
with electrical current keeping them in ''hot status'' ready to
fire -- have developed problems with a component known as the radio
frequency downlink, described by Kern as a ''black box'' that sends
signals back and forth from a ground station to guide the missile
in flight.
</P>
<P>
   Kern said the manufacturer, Raytheon Co., had given warrantees
that the missile to work properly while in ''hot status'' for a
maximum of six months. The Army has kept some Patriots in that
status for years, he said, while swapping 50 to 70 of them a year
for testing and running diagnostic tests on them in the field.
</P>
<P>
   The missiles that developed problems range in age from three to
10 years, Kern said. The components suspected of failing cost as
much as $100,000 per missile, but the replacement effort will cost
more than that. Kern said he could not estimate the total cost.
</P>

   The problem and the swap-out of missiles was first reported

<HEADLINE> Education Head Wants National Tests  </HEADLINE>
By ARLENE LEVINSON, AP National Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Education Secretary Richard Riley says he
thinks daily about the killing last April at Columbine High School
and his department offers guidelines on preventing school violence
and detecting troubled children.
</P>
<P>
   But Riley said schools can't combat student violence without
tighter gun controls.
</P>
<P>
   ''The issue of gun control is a really important part of the
violence,'' the former South Carolina governor said in an interview
Thursday with The Associated Press . ''It's really a shame we have
not focused more on that end of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley, who spoke with AP reporters and editors in a wide-ranging
discussion, also applauded Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the
presumptive GOP presidential nominee, for advocating improved
school standards, better schools and cutting federal aid to failing
schools. But Riley noted these ideas came from Bush's Democratic
predecessors in Austin. And Texas made good use of them with
federal education funds.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bush has stayed with it and it's paid off with sustained
progress in education. The standards movement in Texas -- they've
taken all the federal dollars and used them to good purpose,''
Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush also advocates giving poor students in failing schools
federal vouchers to enroll in private school, which Riley staunchly
opposes. ''It would be a mistake, and very divisive,'' Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Vice President Al Gore's positions on education, Riley
said he expected Gore to promote the current Clinton education
priorities in his own presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   These include Riley's eagerness to see national school tests in
reading and arithmetic to ensure that schools teach the essentials
while still leaving control of education to the states and local
school districts.
</P>
<P>
   ''This one-size-fits-all is not the American way of doing
things,'' Riley said. ''Americans don't like that. They don't
function well like that. They like competitive systems.''
</P>
<P>
   After eight years on the job, Riley said he's learned the
country is too varied in its educational needs for federal control.
His Education Department weathered efforts to dismantle it when
Rep. Newt Gingrich was House speaker. Now the last thing the
Clinton administration wants is to interfere with states' progress
in setting standards.
</P>
<P>
   But some tests, even if voluntary would be useful, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Reading is such a basic skill,'' Riley said. ''If a kid can't
read by the fourth grade, somebody ought to be doing something
serious.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed tests -- which also could be made available to
homeschoolers on the Internet -- would measure how well
fourth-graders read, whether eighth-graders can solve math problems
and whether 12th-graders are ready to graduate, Riley said. States
and schools could use the results to improve their own standards,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-led Congress has opposed Clinton's efforts to
create national testing, allocating federal money to hire teachers,
repair old school buildings and connect classrooms to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives on Capitol Hill argue the Clinton programs
encroach on states' rights and responsibilities to educate
students.
</P>
<P>
   On other education matters, Riley, who sent his four children to
public schools, said public officials should not be required or
pressured to send their children to public schools; and all
families should have access to free preschool; colleges and
universities should align admissions standards with high school
graduation requirements.

<HEADLINE> Senate Committee OKs Seizure Bill  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Senate panel has endorsed legislation aimed
at ending some of the abuses of the federal power to seize the
cars, boats, houses and other property linked to crime.
</P>
<P>
   The voice vote Thursday by the Senate Judiciary Committee to
approve the asset forfeiture bill came after Attorney General Janet
Reno and sponsors from both the House and Senate on Wednesday
worked out the final obstacles to a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The House, led by Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., passed its version of the bill last June by 375-48. But
Senate action has been delayed by concerns that the House bill may
have weakened an important law enforcement tool in the effort to
better protect property owners.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had huge differences at the beginning,'' said Sen. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y. ''We dealt with the excesses without defanging law
enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   As one of many examples of excesses, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.,
recalled a 1989 case in his state where federal marshals seized the
family home and 49 surrounding acres of a man who, without his
wife's knowledge, had pleaded guilty to growing six marijuana
plants. He said that after people in the state protested the man
got his property back.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law the burden of proof rests with the property
owner, who must show that his property was not linked to criminal
activity and not subject to forfeiture.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation shifts that burden to the government. Under the
compromise, the government must make its case ''by a preponderance
of the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The House version required the government to come up with
''clear and convincing evidence,'' but the administration and some
senators argued that that set too high a standard for prosecutors
trying to make a case.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also enables a judge to release property to the owner
if continued government possession poses a substantial hardship,
extends the time a property owner has to challenge a seizure in
court and ends the requirement that a person seeking to recover
property post a bond with the court.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde has argued that current asset forfeiture procedures, which
are largely based on 19th-century admiralty law, are a throwback to
the old Soviet Union where the government could grab property
merely by making charges and without ever convicting a person of a
crime.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is supported by a broad range of groups, including the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American Civil Liberties Union, the
National Rifle Association, and the American Bar Association.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said the bill
should reach the Senate floor in the near future for what is
expected to be quick passage.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill number is H.R. 1658.

<HEADLINE> Man Gets $50,000 for Finding Oscars  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY BREZNICAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Willie Fulgear is oh-so-familiar with the
Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   The salvage man didn't get to keep any of the 52 stolen Academy
Awards he rescued from the trash heap, but he's getting plenty of
experience with acceptance speeches.
</P>
<P>
   He's accepted an invitation to Sunday's Oscars ceremony. He's
also accepted a $50,000 reward from the shipping company that lost
the statuettes.
</P>
<P>
   ''If anybody says honesty don't pay, send them to me,'' Fulgear
said Thursday during the reward presentation. ''I'm a poor man and
I stumbled across, I guess, gold. And I gave it back.''
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, Fulgear, 61, made a living selling discarded machine
parts. Now he hopes his ''golden'' find will get him a book
contract or a movie about his life.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has really turned things around for me,'' he said earlier
at his one-room apartment about a block from the parking lot where
he found the missing Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   Fulgear said he'd like to use the money to make a down payment
on a home for his 22-year-old son, Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Roadway Express, the Akron, Ohio, company hired to deliver the
Oscars, decided to present Fulgear with the money after the Los
Angeles Police Department concluded he had nothing to do with the
theft.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do want to thank him and reward him for his honesty and
important role he played in ensuring that the show goes on,''
Roadway Vice President T.J. O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   A Roadway truck driver has been charged with stealing 55 Oscar
statuettes from a warehouse March 8. Three of the figures are
missing.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
decided Thursday to invite Fulgear to the awards show,
traditionally the most sought-after ticket in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Fulgear, a security guard in the city's fashion district,
was overcome with emotion after learning his father would get the
reward.
</P>
<P>
   ''My Dad has always been a silent hero, the one that nobody ever
talks about. I think the good guy finally wins one here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Fulgear said he hopes the publicity will also help him
find Allen's mother, whom he hasn't seen since they split in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd like my son to know his mother,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> House OKs $1.82 Trillion Budget  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House passage of a Republican-written $1.82
trillion budget for next year draws sharp election-year
distinctions between GOP lawmakers and their Democratic rivals over
tax cuts and spending priorities.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans also used the plan to blur partisan differences
over other issues such as education. And conservative discontent
over the measure's spending levels, which has slowed a similar
package in the Senate, signals that GOP leaders may have a tough
time moving spending bills quickly through Congress later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved the blueprint shortly after midnight this
morning on a mostly party-line, 211-207 vote, nearly 14 hours after
debate began. For much of the time, Democrats replayed arguments of
recent budget battles, accusing the GOP of using budget surpluses
for tax cuts instead of bolstering Social Security and Medicare and
inviting vetoes by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''In their haste to embrace massive, fiscally irresponsible tax
cuts, Republicans are abandoning Social Security, Medicare and
fiscal responsibility,'' House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt,
D-Mo., said.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans said their measure set aside up to $40 billion
over five years to create prescription drug coverage for Medicare
recipients, though they favor a narrower plan than Clinton that
omits higher-income seniors. And they noted that their plan -- like
Clinton's -- would use all $1 trillion in projected Social Security
benefits from 2001 through 2005 to reduce the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if that was a speech lying on the bottom of a
desk drawer from six years ago,'' House Budget Committee Chairman
John Kasich, R-Ohio, said of Gephardt's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ''If you're for the reform agenda, you're going to
support this budget,'' echoing a campaign theme of apparent GOP
presidential nominee George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The budget, which does not need the president's signature, sets
overall tax and spending targets for the fiscal year that begins
Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP plan would match or exceed Clinton's proposals for
veterans health-care, biomedical research and many education
programs, giving the party cover from Democratic attacks.
</P>
<P>
   It also calls for tax cuts for many married couples and for
health care and other expenses. But such tax and spending details
are advisory only, and lawmakers will shape specific programs in
later bills.
</P>
<P>
   The sharpest partisan differences include taxes, which
Republicans would cut by at least $150 billion through 2005 and as
much as about $240 billion. Clinton proposed $99 billion in
reductions, mostly offset by $96 billion in tax hikes on tobacco
and some businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In another clear difference, Clinton would spend $318 billion
next year for domestic programs, excluding automatically paid
benefits like Social Security, and let the total grow along with
inflation through 2005. Republicans would limit next year's total
to $289 billion, and provide more than $100 billion less over the
five-year period.
</P>
<P>
   White House budget chief Jack Lew repeated administration
opposition to the GOP plan. In a letter to congressional leaders,
he said the budget ''makes room for a fiscally irresponsible tax
cut by shortchanging important priorities for the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Republicans supported the proposal. But a small group of
conservatives -- enough to sink the package with the GOP's
razor-thin 11-seat House margin -- complained that Congress would
end up spending beyond the budget's limits.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's another wink and nod from Washington,'' said Rep. Tom
Coburn, R-Okla., a leader of the disgruntled group.
</P>
<P>
   But after long hours of bargaining, leaders promised efforts to
prevent spending bills from growing as they move through the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In that chamber, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici,
R-N.M., has yet to even try pushing a similar plan through his
panel because conservatives want to hold down spending.
</P>
<P>
   As they did when Kasich pushed the plan through his committee
last week, Republicans blocked a Democratic effort to force a vote
on the $483 billion, five-year tax cut Bush has proposed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's proposal and the congressional tax cut are not directly
comparable because they cover different five-year periods.
Nonetheless, the Bush plan would eat into Social Security surpluses
as projected by Congress, and few Republicans would be comfortable
voting to do that.

<HEADLINE> State Dept. Investigating Coelho  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A spokesman for Vice President Al Gore says
campaign chairman Tony Coelho is doing a ''great job'' and will
remain with the Democratic presidential hopeful despite a criminal
investigation into some of his financial deals.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho's lawyer, Stanley Brand, said Thursday that Coelho, a
former congressman from California, is the subject of a State
Department investigation for financial transactions he made in 1998
while serving as head of the U.S. exhibition at the world's fair in
Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   While commissioner general for the U.S. pavilion at Expo 98 in
Lisbon, Coelho took out a $300,000 personal loan used to build an
8-foot-by-60-foot Portuguese-American memorial wall sculpture, and
formed the Luso-American Wave Foundation to help repay the costs.
</P>
<P>
   The pavilion books carried the costs of the sculpture as a
liability, and a State Department inspector general's report said
taxpayers could be responsible for any unpaid bills. The report
also cited mismanagement of the pavilion by Coelho and his staff.
</P>
<P>
   Brand said Coelho repaid much of the loan ''so there was hardly
any benefit to him.'' He said his client has been cooperating with
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The National Journal reported Thursday that the State Department
inspector general's continuing inquiry is criminal in nature. The
probe is being overseen by the Justice Department's Office of
Public Integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign spokesman Chris Lehane referred all inquiries
about the investigation to Brand.
</P>
<P>
   But Lehane was quoted in today's Washington Post, saying
Coelho's ''doing a great job day in and day out, and he's going to
continue to do a great job for the campaign.''

<HEADLINE> Report: INS Agent May Not Be Spy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Federal investigators have conceded that a senior
immigration official charged with espionage may not be a Cuban spy
after all, The Miami Herald reported today.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have filed no evidence in court showing Mariano
Faget ever passed secrets to the Cuban government, the newspaper
said, citing an unidentified senior law enforcement official
familiar with the case.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Gregorie, senior litigation counsel at the U.S.
Attorney's Office in Miami, declined comment to the Herald.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials said Faget still violated the Espionage Act by
revealing classified information to a friend and lying about his
contacts with Cuban officials over a 14-month period.
</P>
<P>
   Faget, 54, a Cuban-born supervisor in the Miami office of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, has pleaded innocent.
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokesman Terry Nelson said a news release announcing
Faget's arrest may have created the misleading impression that he
is charged with spying for Fidel Castro's government. The news
release was entitled: ''Operation False Blue Cuban Spy Case.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The title does not reflect the facts of the case at this
time,'' Nelson said. ''The title does reflect the violation of the
Espionage Act, and to a lay person, espionage and spying are
synonymous.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a federal indictment, Faget was regularly consulted
about immigration cases involving FBI informants and
counterintelligence sources.
</P>
<P>
   He had secret clearance at the INS for 12 years but never
informed the agency about becoming executive vice president of
America-Cuba Inc., a company formed with New York businessman and
Cuban citizen Pedro Font to recruit trade with Cuba if the United
States lifts its trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
   Faget should have submitted an outside employment form
reflecting his ties to America-Cuba and Font, its president, the
indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   Faget was introduced to Cuban government officials by Font, met
with them at least three times and talked to them by phone without
reporting his contacts to the FBI or INS, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   He was caught in an FBI sting Feb. 11 when he was shown secret
documents, was told ''very sensitive'' information that a Cuban
official was about to defect and then called Font 12 minutes later,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   In a second call, Faget promised to keep Font informed while he
was traveling in China, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   The false-statement counts charge Faget lied about contacts with
Cuban government officials and lied on a 1998 INS form saying he
had no foreign business connections.
</P>
<P>
   Trial for Faget is scheduled for April 24.

<HEADLINE> Textiles Co. Accepts Sara Lee Bid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Courtaulds Textiles PLC, a British clothing
company that supplies lingerie to Victoria's Secret, accepted
Friday an increased $238 million takeover offer from Sara Lee Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Courtaulds had rejected as inadequate a bid last month from the
Chicago-based food and clothing group of $164 million.
</P>
<P>
   John Eccles, Courtaulds chairman, said the new price gave ''fair
value'' to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Courtaulds was founded in 1849 as Samuel Courtauld and became
one of Britain's most profitable manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   But the textiles division, split off from a large chemicals and
industrial business in the 1980s, has struggled to fend off the
threat of cheaper foreign imports.
</P>
<P>
   In line with the demands of store chains it supplied, it has
been moving its manufacturing overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Last month it announced plans to cut 500 jobs and close two
British factories.
</P>
<P>
   A profit warning in November left it vulnerable to takeover bids
although earnings figures announced last month came in above
analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The Courtaulds operation will be kept as a separate, standalone
division of Sara Lee, a spokesman for the American company said.
</P>
<P>
   The new owners will press ahead with Courtaulds' plans to sell
off a clutch of businesses including Lyle &AMP; Scott, maker of golfing
sweaters and woollens.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices are mixed today in early trading.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 46 points. Advancers and
decliners are evenly split on the New York Stock Exchange. The
Nasdaq is ahead 45 points and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Stock Index
is up a fraction. The S&AMP;P 500 index finished yesterday with its
third straight record high, and the Dow rose to its highest level
in seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But all the gains yesterday may have left the market with the
need for some rest. Markets have been higher overseas, but an
absence of news is robbing the market of much more upside
potential.
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices are lower after a report on durable goods orders
showed a big drop in demand for February.

<HEADLINE> BMW Denies GM Talks for Land Rover  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- German automaker BMW on Friday denied
that it was entertaining a better buyout offer from General Motors
Corp. for the company's Land Rover division -- a unit offered to
Ford Motor Co. just last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are in exclusive negotiations with Ford,'' BMW spokesman
Juerg Dinner said.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes in response to a report Friday in the
Financial Times that said U.S.-based GM was considering whether to
outbid rival Ford, which has an agreement to acquire the maker of
off-road vehicles for $2.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   GM Europe spokesman Tony LaRocca, speaking from his office in
Zurich, Switzerland, called the report ''speculation'' and refused
to comment on it.
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Hendry, the chairman of GM's Adam Opel unit in
Europe, told the British newspaper that ''Land Rover is a great
brand, and until the (Ford) transaction is a legal deal it is
possible that GM could intervene.''
</P>
<P>
   BMW's Dinner said there were no talks with GM and noted that BMW
was already working with Ford on the details of a takeover after
signing a letter of agreement last week.
</P>
<P>
   BMW announced the sale of Land Rover last week, a day after it
said it was selling its loss-making Rover passenger car division to
the British investment group Alchemy Partners Ltd.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Sells Stake in Carmaker  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- The Indonesian Bank Restructuring
Agency sold its entire stake in automaker PT Astra International to
a Singapore consortium for $506 million, the agency's chairman said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The winning consortium is led by auto distributor Cycle &AMP;
Carriage Ltd., IBRA Chairman Cacuk Sudarijanto said.
</P>
<P>
   Its bid was selected over a competing bid from a group led by
Newbridge Capital Ltd. of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''The winner was selected only based on price,'' Cacuk told a
news conference, adding that the two final bidders had proposed
acceptable terms and conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Astra builds components for Toyota, and assembles Toyota and BMW
cars as well as Honda motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
   The long-awaited sale is an important victory for Abdurrahman
Wahid's new government, which is trying to attract foreign
investment in Indonesia to help boost the country's troubled
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The agency will pass on the sale proceeds to the Indonesian
government to help close a budget gap.
</P>
<P>
   IBRA controls over $100 billion in assets from state banks and
banks taken over by the government as part of an effort to clean up
Indonesia's banking sector.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Exchanges Talking Merger  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE CARPENTER, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Board
Options Exchange are considering merging, officials close to the
two exchanges said today.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Tribune reported that a merger may be an option for
the two exchanges to resolve a dispute that has stalled the Board
of Trade's proposal to reorganize into two separate corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Trade has threatened legal action in that dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, members of both exchanges told the Chicago Sun-Times
that a merger could help both compete with companies that are
trying to create electronic markets for financial products.
</P>
<P>
   Letters traded by the chairmen of the two exchanges this week
indicate the CBOE has hired an investment banker to look into
merger possibilities with Board of Trade bankers.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the exchanges speaking on condition of
anonymity confirmed the existence of the letters today. But one
said any possible merger remains far in the future because of all
the hurdles that would need to be cleared.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a unique opportunity to accomplish something
significant,'' CBOE Chairman William Brodsky wrote to David
Brennan, his counterpart at the Board of Trade. Brodsky said he
hoped the Board of Trade would put any legal action on hold.
</P>
<P>
   In his reply, Brennan agreed to postpone legal action for two
weeks, ''expecting our investment banking teams will be able to
work out a plan for our consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   A merger would mean job losses within the industry. But Lee
Stern, a longtime Board of Trade member, said merger talks ''will
be a benefit to everybody involved.''

<HEADLINE> Heartburn Drug Removed From Market  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER, AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Shares of Johnson &AMP; Johnson tumbled nearly 9
percent today as investors reacted warily to the health care
conglomerate's decision late Thursday to stop marketing the
heartburn drug Propulsid.
</P>
<P>
   Propulsid has been linked to 80 deaths since 1993 and a variety
of serious cardiac problems in hundreds of patients.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of J&AMP;J were down $6.93} to 73.06\ at midmorning trading
on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The company will no longer distribute the drug to pharmacies
after July and will only make it available to a limited number of
patients who fail other therapies. The ''limited-access'' program
will begin May 1.
</P>
<P>
   Propulsid had $950 million in sales last year, but J&AMP;J estimates
with the new restrictions it will generate just $250 million in
sales this year. The drug has already had $150 million in sales in
the first quarter of 2000, J&AMP;J said.
</P>
<P>
   Patients who are now taking Propulsid are advised to speak with
their doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Propulsid, one of J&AMP;J's top-selling drugs, was approved by the
FDA in 1993. But there has been a series of increasingly strong
actions to warn against serious side effects from the drug.
</P>
<P>
   As of Dec. 31, 80 deaths and 341 heart rhythm abnormalities have
been associated with Propulsid, FDA officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Propulsid remains safe and effective for the vast majority of
patients when used according to the approved prescribing
information,'' J&AMP;J said. The drug is made by J&AMP;J's Janssen
Pharmaceutica subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the FDA announced that there had been some deaths among
patients taking the drug and issued a warning that Propulsid was
linked to cardiac problems in some patients. The drug's label was
revised then to reflect this concern.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the FDA issued an even more severe warning. Patients
were urged to be tested to make sure the drug had not affected
their hearts. New labels also warned that Propulsid should not be
used by patients with disorders of the heart, kidney or lung, or by
patients who were taking some medications to treat heart problems,
allergies, depression or AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   J&AMP;J said that despite the warnings, ''some inappropriate use has
continued'' in the United States. The best solution, the company
said, was limiting access to the drug ''while ensuring that
appropriate patients who have exhausted other treatment options can
still benefit from it.''
</P>
<P>
   The FDA had ordered an advisory board meeting in April to
discuss the problems with Propulsid. That meeting has now been
canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Florence Houn of the FDA said that Propulsid had a unique
action that was important to some patients. She said the pill
triggered motility, a wave like action in the gut, that moved
gastric acid away from the esophagus, thus preventing nighttime
heartburn for some patients.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time this week that safety concerns prompted
the FDA and a drug maker to act on a medication.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a diabetes drug that has been linked to at least 61
deaths was withdrawn from the market after a review of safety data
showed it was more toxic to the liver than comparable drugs. The
FDA said that it requested that Rezulin, a drug for treatment of
Type 2, or adult-onset, diabetes, no longer be sold. The agency
said that Warner-Lambert, the drug manufacturer, agreed to the
action.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology shares rallied for a fourth day
Friday, lifting the Nasdaq composite index back above 5,000, while
blue-chip stocks sagged following Thursday's 253-point gain by the
Dow Jones industrial average.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow was off
57.40 at 11,062.46, but still held a gain of more than 450 points
for the week.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mostly positive. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index was up 3.44 at 1,530.79, padding Thursday's record
close. The Nasdaq composite was up 66.23 at 5,006.84, about 40
points shy of the March 10 closing record of 5,0048.62.
</P>
<P>
   Before the open, the government reported that orders to U.S.
factories for big-ticket equipment and machinery fell 2.3 percent
in February, the largest decline in 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger-than-expected drop, which followed a 2.2 percent
decline in January, could help ease some concerns that the Federal
Reserve will keep fighting inflationary pressures by slowing the
economy with higher interest rates. The central bank raised its
short-term lending rates again on Tuesday, the fifth increase since
last summer, and many analysts expect the Fed will boost rates
again.
</P>
<P>
   In other trading today, advancing issues outnumbered decliners
by a small margin on the New York Stock Exchange, but Nasdaq
gainers led by a nearly 2-to-1 ratio. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies was up 5.44 at 579.23.
</P>
<P>
   Early standouts included Internet equipment maker Cisco Systems,
which jumped to another record high, rising 2 11/16 to 80{ as the
most active Nasdaq issue.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson, one of the 30 Dow stocks, slid 7 1/16 to 72
15/16 after Thursday's announcement that the company will stop
marketing Propulsid, a popular heartburn drug that has been
associated with 80 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume came to 147.65 million shares, up slightly from
Thursday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.29 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 1.96 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 2.15 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up
0.74 percent.

   Factory Orders Fall 2.3 Percent
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Orders to U.S. factories for big-ticket
manufactured goods fell 2.3 percent in February, the largest
decline in 10 months as demand fell sharply for transportation
equipment including airplanes and industrial machinery. The
Commerce Department reported today that orders for durable goods --
items expected to last at least three years -- fell to a seasonally
adjusted $208.4 billion last month. That followed a 2.2 percent
decline in January, larger than the government previously
estimated.

   EU Pursuing High-Tech Economy
</P>
<P>
   LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- European Union leaders issued an
ambitious blueprint today to make the European economy ''the most
competitive and dynamic'' by harnessing the power of the
information revolution. Ending a two-day summit, the 15 leaders
said making their economies more Internet-driven will put them on
the fast track to more electronic trade, jobs and an annual
economic growth rate of 3 percent in the years ahead. That would be
up from an EU average of 2 percent this year. They set no target
for unemployment, which now averages 10 percent -- more than double
the U.S. rate.

   Heartburn Drug Removed From Market
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Shares of Johnson &AMP; Johnson tumbled nearly 9
percent today as investors reacted warily to the health care
conglomerate's decision late yesterday to stop marketing the
heartburn drug Propulsid. Propulsid has been linked to 80 deaths
since 1993 and a variety of serious cardiac problems in hundreds of
patients. Shares of J&AMP;J were down 7[ at 72~ in midmorning trading
on the New York Stock Exchange. The company will no longer
distribute the drug to pharmacies after July and will only make it
available to a limited number of patients who fail other therapies.
The ''limited-access'' program will begin May 1.

merger may be an option for the two exchanges to resolve a dispute
that has stalled the Board of Trade's proposal to reorganize into
two separate corporations. The Board of Trade has threatened legal
action in that dispute. Meanwhile, members of both exchanges told
the Chicago Sun-Times that a merger could help both compete with
companies that are trying to create electronic markets for

   Gov't Retreats From Microsoft Split

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department appears to be
retreating from demands in secret negotiations to break up the
Microsoft, a concession that would dramatically improve chances for
settling the landmark antitrust case. Microsoft has indicated it
will not accept any settlement that divides the company, and U.S.
Assistant Attorney General Joel I. Klein believes such a punishment
may not be necessary to adequately restrain what the trial judge
characterized as Microsoft's monopoly power over the technology
industry, said two people close to the case.

to California. BP Amoco spokesman Tom Koch emphasized that the
decision to end exports after the current export contract expires

<HEADLINE> German Rail Workers Threaten Strike  </HEADLINE>
By HANS GREIMEL, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Railway workers threatened to shut
down trains starting this weekend if management won't temper their
streamlining plans that unions say could cost up to 70,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bahn AG and the main German railway union, GdED, met
Friday afternoon in Cologne to iron out their differences. If no
agreement could be reached, the union said it would target a major
German city for a three-hour work stoppage on Saturday and possibly
an entire region on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Taking no action would be a very dangerous course,'' GdED
chairman Norbert Hansen said before negotiations began.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bahn -- which posted losses last year for the first time
of about $85 million -- is tapping an atmosphere of economic reform
in Germany with proposals to downsize and make operations more
efficient. But the move also comes as the country struggles to tame
its stubborn 11 percent unemployment rate that has more than 4
million Germans out of work.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bahn would not say Friday how many jobs could be lost,
but said the plan calls for cutting personnel costs by $1.8 billion
over the next four years. Chairman Hartmut Mehdorn has said that
could entail a 5 percent annual reduction in the company's 252,000
jobs, or roughly 12,500 jobs a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we don't save money and keep making losses, we will see
ourselves in a very, very bad business situation in four years,''
said company spokesman Uwe Herz. The railroad, a government-owned
company, plans to go public perhaps as soon as 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders say the railroad is underestimating the number of
jobs affected and say additional positions will be lost through
early retirement and a hiring freeze. Herz confirmed that Deutsche
Bahn was looking at other ways of reducing the workforce besides a
straight layoff.
</P>
<P>
   If the unions strike, Deutsche Bahn's Mehdorn has threatened to
back out of an agreement on work guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   Union boss Hansen has said the agreement -- currently being
negotiated -- specifies there will be no layoffs through 2002.

<HEADLINE> Pressure Mounts Before OPEC Meeting  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE STANLEY, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- OPEC oil ministers are widely expected to reach an
agreement next week that would boost petroleum supplies to thirsty
importers.
</P>
<P>
   But the crucial, unanswered question remains whether OPEC
countries will pump crude in sufficient quantities to ease oil
prices down from the highest levels since the 1991 Persian Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has been
under intense pressure from the United States to relax year-old
production quotas that have caused prices for crude and refined
products such as gasoline to skyrocket.
</P>
<P>
   American motorists now pay an average of $1.54 per gallon for
unleaded gasoline, an increase of 57.3 cents since last March,
according to a recent survey conducted for the AAA auto club.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts are warning of possible shortages and
$2-a-gallon gasduring the peak driving season this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Oil ministers for the 11 OPEC countries are to meet Monday in
Vienna, Austria, for their semiannual review of global oil markets.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia, OPEC's No. 1 exporter, has expressed interest in
stabilizing prices at a level that won't cause extreme economic
pain for the countries that buy its oil.
</P>
<P>
   If high oil prices start bringing down economies, producers
fear, demand for oil will plunge, and OPEC revenue from crude oil
sales could quickly shrink.
</P>
<P>
   Other members of the cartel have echoed the call for price
stability. Even Iran, long a hawkish supporter of high prices, now
appears to back some form of a production increase.
</P>
<P>
   But OPEC has not shown willingness to boost production by the 2
million-2.5 million barrels per day that the United States and
other industrial powers are hoping for.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, analysts predict that OPEC will raise its daily output
by little more than 1 million barrels. Many say this won't be
enough to simultaneously replenish depleted oil inventories, meet
seasonal needs for gasoline and push down prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's unlikely that OPEC will simply agree to what the
West is asking for,'' warns Charlie Sharp of the London brokerage
T. Hoare Canaccord.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC produces more than 26 million barrels of crude each day, or
about 35 percent of the world's supply.
</P>
<P>
   Non-OPEC producers that have cut output in tandem with the
cartel, including Mexico and Norway, favor an increase in
production but are waiting to see what OPEC does.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, OPEC is a victim of it own success in reviving
prices from the doldrums of late 1998, when crude sagged to less
than $11 per barrel.
</P>
<P>
   After prices failed to respond to two rounds of production cuts
earlier that year, OPEC finally got results in March 1999 when it
trimmed output by an additional 2.1 million barrels per day,
reducing the global supply by 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Crude prices more than tripled as a result, peaking in the
United States on March 8 at $34.37 per barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for home heating oil and gasoline have soared, creating
what Peter Gignoux, head of the petroleum desk for Salomon Smith
Barney, calls ''an oil-shock quarter'' for the first three months
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has been meeting with
officials of oil-producing nations to stress America's displeasure
with costlier crude.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said Wednesday that if OPEC doesn't act to bring down
prices, the United States would reserve the option of dipping into
its own strategic petroleum stockpile.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC Secretary-General Rilwanu Lukman said Wednesday that it is
unfair to assume that the Vienna meeting will result in increased
output.
</P>
<P>
   However, other OPEC sources and industry analysts believe that a
decision to boost production is likely.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there is a consensus over major issues,'' says Raad
Alkadiri of the Petroleum Finance Co., a consulting firm based in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   One complication is that OPEC members already are cheating on
their own quotas, overproducing by at least 1 million barrels per
day. OPEC's compliance rate with its cuts of last March has slipped
from a high of 91 percent in July to 74 percent in February,
according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Any increase in production must somehow account for these
''unofficial'' barrels, which have benefitted consumers by helping
to moderate the spike in prices.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp of T. Hoare Canaccord suggests that OPEC might decide to
let its compliance rate slip to perhaps 60 percent, in addition to
increasing its official production.
</P>
<P>
   ''That effectively would create a softish landing in the oil
price,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipation that OPEC will open its taps further has caused
prices to slip over the past several days.
</P>
<P>
   West Texas Intermediate crude, the benchmark U.S. oil, has
tumbled almost 20 percent since peaking two weeks ago. But it was
up 57 cents at $27.88 a barrel this morning on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Airline Ends Deal With Muslim Group  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID KOENIG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- American Airlines has stopped selling
frequent-flier miles to a Muslim organization that provides aid to
Palestinians and has been accused of aiding an extremist group in
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development raised $6
million last year, including about $500,000 from donors who
received frequent-flier miles, officials of the tax-exempt
organization said.
</P>
<P>
   It rewarded donors of $100 or more with frequent-flier miles
from the airline.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli government has accused the foundation of supporting
the Hamas terror organization.
</P>
<P>
   Shukri Abu Baker, president of the Richardson-based foundation,
denied that it aids terrorists, saying it provides only
humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Israeli-occupied territories
and to refugees in Lebanon and Jordan. He accused the airline of
buckling under pressure from Israel and its U.S. supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's bothering the Israelis is that we are helping the
refugees. We're keeping the issue of the refugees alive,'' Baker
said.
</P>
<P>
   The airline said Thursday it decided to stop selling the
frequent-flier miles to the group late last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not here to pass judgment about the allegation. We
simply made a decision because we didn't want to insert ourselves
in the controversy,'' American spokesman Chris Chiames said.
''We're not buckling under anyone's pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote to American chief
executive Donald Carty, asking the airline to end its ties to Holy
Land, which he said ''is well-known to be a financial front for
Hamas.'' The militant Islamic group opposes peace with Israel and
has claimed responsibility for dozens of deadly attacks on
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity
said Thursday the agency is cooperating in an FBI-led investigation
of Holy Land to see if it has violated a federal law against
raising money for suspected terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI spokeswoman would neither confirm nor deny the existence
of an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   No criminal charges have been brought against the foundation.

<HEADLINE> Poll Has 'Beauty' Winning Oscar  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ''American Beauty'' seems on track to take
the best picture Oscar handily and Denzel Washington's performance
in ''The Hurricane'' seems likely to narrowly win the best actor
award, a controversial Wall Street Journal poll of Oscar voters
says.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper polled 356 of 5,607 voting members of the Academy
of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Many of the voters polled
asked to remain anonymous, but several openly discussed their
picks, the newspaper said in a story published today.
</P>
<P>
   The academy sent its members a letter asking them not to
cooperate with the newspaper survey. Academy president Robert Rehme
had called the poll ''a threat to the Academy Awards process.''
</P>
<P>
   Best supporting actor nominee Michael Caine (''The Cider House
Rules'')earned the vote of comedian Buddy Hackett, who told the
newspaper that he wasn't voting for young Haley Joel Osment of the
ghost thriller ''The Sixth Sense.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In another five years, he'll have pimples, and no one will
want to talk about him,'' Hackett joked.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Stevens, entertainment editor of the Weekend Journal, told
The Associated Press today that the paper was not trying to thwart
the Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   ''We make no claims to scientific accuracy,'' Stevens said from
New York. ''I guess we'll know if we're right on Sunday. This was
journalism, a series of interviews and an evaluation of what they
told us. We did not steal the Oscars or the nominations.''
</P>
<P>
   Telephone messages left with the academy before office hours
this morning were not returned immediately.
</P>
<P>
   It was another headache for Oscar officials, who this year have
seen their ballots lost, their statues stolen and a Web site that
claimed to have a short list of nominees the day before the names
were announced last month. The Web site's claim was false.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal's main goal was to learn more about the
voting process and explain it for readers, Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We found some real fascinating insights into how they think,''
she said. ''For example, the number of people who told us they were
voting for 'Cider House Rules.' It was really a vote against
'American Beauty.'''
</P>
<P>
   That point was made in the story by Norman Alden, 75, a retired
film and television actor who's done everything from guest shots in
''The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin'' to a small part in ''Ed Wood.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't care about bad marriages and fooling around and all
these crazy things,'' said Alden, referring to the dysfunctional
family of ''American Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Other awards as predicted by the Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
   -- Best actress: Hilary Swank, ''Boys Don't Cry.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Best director: Sam Mendes, ''American Beauty.''
</P>
<P>

Rules.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Says He'll Stick With Coelho  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore said today his campaign
chairman Tony Coelho is doing a ''terrific job'' and he suggested
Coelho would remain with his presidential campaign despite a
criminal investigation into past financial dealings.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tony Coelho is doing a terrific job day after day. He will
continue to do a terrific job,'' Gore said at a campaign stop in
Macomb, Mich., at a school.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was concerned about the possibility of criminal
wrongdoing, Gore refused to elaborate on his statement, saying,
''He's doing a great job and he will keep on doing so.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican rival George W. Bush, asked today about Gore's
problems regarding Coelho and an investigation of White House
e-mail, said:
</P>
<P>
   ''I think America is just wondering about these investigations.
And we need to let the sun shine in and put all the facts on the
table so everybody knows what the truth is. But the best way to
make sure we get rid of all these investigations is to change
administrations.''
</P>
<P>
   Coelho's lawyer, Stanley Brand, said Thursday that Coelho, a
former congressman from California, is the subject of a State
Department investigation for financial transactions he made in 1998
while serving as head of the U.S. exhibition at the world's fair in
Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   While commissioner general for the U.S. pavilion at Expo 98 in
Lisbon, Coelho took out a $300,000 personal loan used to build an
8-foot-by-60-foot Portuguese-American memorial wall sculpture, and
formed the Luso-American Wave Foundation to help repay the costs.
</P>
<P>
   The pavilion books carried the costs of the sculpture as a
liability, and a State Department inspector general's report said
taxpayers could be responsible for any unpaid bills. The report
also cited mismanagement of the pavilion by Coelho and his staff.
</P>
<P>
   Brand said Coelho repaid much of the loan ''so there was hardly
any benefit to him.'' He said his client has been cooperating with
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The National Journal reported Thursday that the State Department
inspector general's continuing inquiry is criminal in nature. The
investigation is being overseen by the Justice Department's Office
of Public Integrity.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Leading stock indexes rose toward new highs
today as technology stocks rallied for a fourth straight session,
lifting the Nasdaq composite index back above 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   At midday on Wall Street, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up
18.02 at 1,545.37, padding Thursday's record close. The Nasdaq
composite was up 105.81 at 5,046.42, flirting with the March 10
closing mark of 5,048.62.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 49.95 at 11,169.81 after
swinging from an early slide to a 115-point gain. The Dow, which
rose 253 points on Friday, has gained nearly 600 points this week,
but still sits more than 500 points below the closing record of
11,722.98 set Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Before the open, the givernment reported that orders to U.S.
factories for big-ticket equipment and machinery fell 2.3 percent
in February, the largest decline in 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger-than-expected drop, which followed a 2.2 percent
decline in January, could help ease some concerns that the Federal
Reserve will keep fighting inflationary pressures by slowing the

<HEADLINE> J&AMP;J Shares Fall on Propulsid News  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER, AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Shares of Johnson &AMP; Johnson tumbled nearly 10
percent today as investors reacted warily to the health care
conglomerate's decision late Thursday to stop marketing the
heartburn drug Propulsid.
</P>
<P>
   Propulsid has been linked to 80 deaths since 1993 and a variety
of serious cardiac problems in hundreds of patients.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of J&AMP;J were down $7.68} to $72.31\ by early afternoon on
the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The company will no longer distribute the drug to pharmacies
after July and will only make it available to a limited number of
patients who fail other therapies. The ''limited-access'' program
will begin May 1.
</P>
<P>
   Propulsid had $950 million in sales last year, but J&AMP;J estimates
with the new restrictions it will generate just $250 million in
sales this year. The drug has already had $150 million in sales in
the first quarter of 2000, J&AMP;J said.
</P>
<P>
   Patients who are now taking Propulsid are advised to speak with
their doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Propulsid, one of J&AMP;J's top-selling drugs, was approved by the
FDA in 1993. But there has been a series of increasingly strong
actions to warn against serious side effects from the drug.
</P>
<P>
   As of Dec. 31, 80 deaths and 341 heart rhythm abnormalities have
been associated with Propulsid, FDA officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Propulsid remains safe and effective for the vast majority of
patients when used according to the approved prescribing
information,'' J&AMP;J said. The drug is made by J&AMP;J's Janssen
Pharmaceutica subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the FDA announced that there had been some deaths among
patients taking the drug and issued a warning that Propulsid was
linked to cardiac problems in some patients. The drug's label was
revised then to reflect this concern.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the FDA issued an even more severe warning. Patients
were urged to be tested to make sure the drug had not affected
their hearts. New labels also warned that Propulsid should not be
used by patients with disorders of the heart, kidney or lung, or by
patients who were taking some medications to treat heart problems,
allergies, depression or AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   J&AMP;J said that despite the warnings, ''some inappropriate use has
continued'' in the United States. The best solution, the company
said, was limiting access to the drug ''while ensuring that
appropriate patients who have exhausted other treatment options can
still benefit from it.''
</P>
<P>
   The FDA had ordered an advisory board meeting in April to
discuss the problems with Propulsid. That meeting has now been
canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Florence Houn of the FDA said that Propulsid had a unique
action that was important to some patients. She said the pill
triggered motility, a wave like action in the gut, that moved
gastric acid away from the esophagus, thus preventing nighttime
heartburn for some patients.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time this week that safety concerns prompted
the FDA and a drug maker to act on a medication.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a diabetes drug that has been linked to at least 61
deaths was withdrawn from the market after a review of safety data
showed it was more toxic to the liver than comparable drugs. The
FDA said that it requested that Rezulin, a drug for treatment of
Type 2, or adult-onset, diabetes, no longer be sold. The agency
said that Warner-Lambert, the drug manufacturer, agreed to the
action.

<HEADLINE> Boy Charged for Having Gun in Class  </HEADLINE>
By THOMAS J. SHEERAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LISBON, Ohio (AP) -- To Dan Kemats, it seemed like time had stood
still.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old English and social studies teacher at McKinley
Elementary School had been ordered to get down on the floor by a
12-year-old student wielding a gun. Twelve of the boy's sixth-grade
classmates were also in the room Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seemed like forever we were sitting on the ground. It was
probably a few minutes,'' Kemats said.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Robb, another teacher summoned by a student who heard the
exchange in the hallway, persuaded the boy to give up the gun and
no one was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was charged this morning with inducing panic, aggravated
menacing, carrying a concealed weapon and illegally carrying a
firearm in a school zone, Columbiana County Prosecutor Robert
Herron said.
</P>
<P>
   He will be held at a juvenile detention center until Monday,
when he will be arraigned, Herron said. If convicted, the boy could
be held in custody until he is 21.
</P>
<P>
   The boy had been on crossing duty with another sixth-grader,
Katie Hartman, Thursday when he told her: ''Goodbye, Katie. I won't
be back,'' The Vindicator of Youngstown reported today.
</P>
<P>
   She said she asked what he meant, but he didn't answer.
</P>
<P>
   The boy said before that ''his biological mother was in jail and
he wanted to visit her, be with her,'' said Anthony Krukowski,
superintendent of Lisbon schools.
</P>
<P>
   Police Sgt. Fred Carlisle confirmed the boy wanted to reunite
with his mother. ''Yes, that's what he told a teacher and one of
the police officers,'' he said. Authorities didn't release
information on the mother's situation but the Akron Beacon Journal
said she was in prison on a drug-related charge.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's father told police the weapon -- a loaded, 9 mm
semiautomatic -- had been stored on a dresser top with a fully
engaged trigger lock. Police Chief John Higgins said the boy
apparently found the key and removed the lock.
</P>
<P>
   No classes were scheduled for today but the school will be open
for students who want to come in for counseling. Lisbon is about 25
miles south of Youngstown, near the Ohio-West Virginia-Pennsylvania
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Robb told NBC's ''Today'' show this morning that she realized
the gun was real when the boy ''took the clip out and then he put
it back in.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The only time I really felt a little bit of fear was when he
was walking toward me with the gun and I realized at that point he
could just raise it and shoot me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hugged him and I held onto him and I said, 'Give me the
gun,' and he handed it to me.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Dismisses Snake Case  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL PEARSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLYLE, Ill. (AP) -- A judge Friday threw out the case against a
couple whose pet python killed their 3-year-old son, ruling that
prosecutors had not presented enough evidence to even justify
sending the matter to the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton County Judge Harold Pennock III issued a directed
verdict -- innocent of child endangerment -- just before attorneys
were scheduled to begin closing arguments in the week-long trial of
Melissa and Robert Altom. The couple, who could have faced 10 years
in prison, hugged upon hearing the judge's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Altom died Aug. 29 after the family's 7{-foot African rock
python got out of its cage as the family slept. The boy was crushed
to death.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling cannot be appealed. Defense lawyer Alan Cohen said
the couple can now begin to grieve.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're happy with the verdict,'' Robert Altom said as he was
leaving the courthouse. ''We don't feel we even should have been
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton County State's Attorney Henry Bergmann criticized
Pennock for barring testimony on police reports that the couple had
a previous python that had escaped from another cage. That
information would have established that the couple had a history of
failing to protect their son from danger, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a snake expert for the defense, David Barker,
testified that python attacks on people are rare.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I couldn't have foreseen this event, then I don't see how
anyone could have anticipated this event,'' said Barker, a snake
breeder who has extensively studied and written about African rock
pythons.
</P>
<P>
   Snake experts who testified for the prosecution said there was
about a 2-inch gap in the aquarium's homemade wood lid that might
have allowed the snake to escape.
</P>
<P>
   During her testimony, Ms. Altom broke down in tears and wailed
as she looked at pictures of her son in his first Halloween costume
and sitting on Santa Claus' lap.

<HEADLINE> ThyssenKrupp Seeks Mannesmann Pact  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) -- German steelmaker ThyssenKrupp AG is
looking for ways to cooperate with the engineering and automotive
subsidiary of Mannesmann AG, the conglomerate that agreed last
month to be acquired by British telecommunications giant Vodafone
AirTouch PLC.
</P>
<P>
   ThyssenKrupp said Friday it would like to reach a wide-ranging
pact that includes all activities of Mannesman's Atecs unit.
Mannesmann had planned to spin off Atecs as a separate company
sometime this summer, possibly in June.
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Times reported Friday that ThyssenKrupp had
offered up to $8.73 billion to buy the Atecs operations from
Vodafone.
</P>
<P>
   Neither company would comment on the report, although Vodafone
said it had been approached by ThyssenKrupp.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone said it wasn't yet able to respond to ThyssenKrupp's
approach since it has yet to take operating control of Mannesmann.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann issued a statement Friday opposing a possible merger
of ThyssenKrupp and Atecs, saying Vodafone is obliged to go ahead
with Atecs' public offering.
</P>
<P>
   ''The business activities of Atecs Mannesmann and ThyssenKrupp
don't fit together,'' Mannesmann said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Vodafone would probably be able to get more for
the division through selling it to a single buyer than by selling
stock in it in a public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone agreed to buy Mannesmann in a deal that would be the
biggest corporate merger ever mainly for Mannesmann's fast growing
telecommunications division. Sealed after months of rancor,
Vodafone is paying $180 billion in stock for the whole company,
including the engineering and automotive branch.

<HEADLINE> 'Millionaire' Gets Its Third Winner  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Naming the very first computer bug earned
high-tech worker Joe Trela a million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Trela, a 25-year-old customer service representative for a
computer company, on Thursday became the third contestant to win
the top prize on ABC's hit game show ''Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cal Tech graduate was asked what insect shorted out an early
computer and inspired the term, ''computer bug.''
</P>
<P>
   Trela's choices? A moth, roach, fly or Japanese beetle. He
correctly identified the moth as the culprit.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was lucky, which I guess was good enough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Trela certainly wasn't pressured into rushing his way through
the game. He took nearly 15 minutes -- although it was edited down
for broadcast -- to identify Yogi Berra as the baseball player who
appeared in the most World Series games.
</P>
<P>
   ''The producers were getting kind of cranky with me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he had won $32,000, Trela had used all three of his
lifelines. That meant he had to answer the big-money questions
without help from a friend or the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Trela, from Gilroy, Calif., is the youngest person to win the
game. The show now airs in 52 countries, and there's been only one
top prize winner outside of the United States. A contestant in
South Africa won earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Trela, who is a bachelor, hopes to landscape his mother's
backyard with the money, and maybe visit a friend in England. He
won't say whether he plans to quit his job, but figures the money
will give him the freedom to finish a science fiction screenplay
he's been writing.
</P>
<P>
   Since he promised on the broadcast to pay his brother's tuition
at Notre Dame, Trela figures he better follow through.
</P>
<P>
   And Alex Trebek will love this: Trela is a ''Jeopardy'' reject.
He said he tried out for ''Jeopardy'' several times but was never
invited on the show.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jeopardy'' host Trebek recently mocked ''Millionaire'' for its
easy questions, but reportedly declined an invitation to appear in
a celebrity version of the game.

<HEADLINE> Retired Actor Convicted of Murder  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A 71-year-old retired actor who twice ran
over a man after a traffic dispute was convicted of second-degree
murder.
</P>
<P>
   The Superior Court jury, which considered charges ranging from
first-degree murder to vehicular manslaughter, convicted Robert
Weldon Cleaves on Thursday after five days of deliberations. He
faces up 16 years to life in prison when he is sentenced April 12.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves, who appeared on ''Dragnet'' and other television shows,
followed Arnold William Guerriero in his car in September 1998
after they exchanged insults during a traffic confrontation in
Santa Monica.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy District Attorney Ralph Shapiro said that after
Guerriero, 38, got out of his car, Cleaves ran over him, dragging
him about 350 feet, then backed up and ran over Guerriero again.
Guerriero died later at a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves surrendered to police soon after the attack. He
testified that he accidentally struck Guerriero after the man
pointed a gun at him. No gun was ever found.

<HEADLINE> Saturn Cuts Hours at Tenn. Plant  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRING HILL, Tenn. (AP) -- Saturn Corp. will cut production hours
by one-third at its plant here because of lagging demand for its
compact cars and station wagons.
</P>
<P>
   The move disclosed Friday comes a day after Saturn said it was
cutting production at the Wilmington, Del., plant that builds the
midsize L-series sedans and wagons.
</P>
<P>
   Both plants shut down for a week early this month to reduce
inventories; Saturn had a 61-day inventory of S-series at the end
of February, the industry norm for supply.
</P>
<P>
   The new schedule at the Spring Hill plant, phased in beginning
April 3, calls for more than 5,000 assembly-line workers who were
formerly split into three crews for 120 hours of production to work
two fixed shifts for 80 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Employees not building cars will be readying the plant to build
a sport utility vehicle beginning next year, spokesman Bill Betts
said.
</P>
<P>
   Betts would not quantify how much production would be affected,
but said the assembly line speed won't be increased.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can probably say it will reduce production from where it was
when we had three crews,'' Betts said. ''The net effect is obvious.
You do the math.''
</P>
<P>
   Employee hours will not be cut, and no layoffs are planned. But
Betts said there may be some reduction in force by attrition
through retirements or when workers move to other General Motors'
plants.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do expect as opportunities become available for Saturn team
members to move to other locations; some will take advantage of
that. But if they remain they will not be laid off,'' Betts said.
</P>
<P>
   The plant has about 6,500 workers represented by the United
Autoworkers.
</P>
<P>
   Saturn sales have fallen in the past several months as demand
for small cars overall and Saturn's aging product line has
declined. Sales are up this year, due to the addition of the
L-series; S-series sales are down.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, total sales of Spring Hill's S-series coupe, sedan and
station wagon fell by more than 10 percent from the previous year,
to about 208,000 units.
</P>
<P>
   Betts said SUV production will require a significant number of
people when it gets under way next year, and that there are no
plans to offer early retirement bonuses or other incentives to
reduce the work force.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Oscar-Watching Is Rigorous  </HEADLINE>
By MATT WOLF, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- More coffee, please. It's time again for that
annual all-night marathon that addicts find so darkly irresistible,
especially in countries where most people just go to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't easy being an Oscar-obsessive overseas.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, you can read the next day about how each year's
British nominees fared (this year there are four up for acting
awards). But try watching the reel competition in real time and
you'll find yourself forced into a degree of preparatory legwork
that merits a movie all its own.
</P>
<P>
   To start with, there's the time difference: eight hours between
Los Angeles and London, except for years (like this one) when the
British clocks go ahead a week earlier than American ones,
resulting in a ceremony start of 2:30 a.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
   And that's if you can find it.
</P>
<P>
   In the best of years, the Oscars are televised live over the
British Broadcasting Corp. so that anybody with a TV and a
willingness to forgo sleep can tune in. (Don't even suggest
videotaping the awards to be watched at a more sensible hour: No
Oscar fanatic ever comes late to the news of the winners.)
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, however, the ceremony has been relegated to
a cable channel (this year, Sky Premier), as an enticement to
subscribers. It's not unusual to find yourself phoning around to
even the vaguest of acquaintances who might have subscribed to that
year's particular service. (I'd never heard of UK Gold before or
since the year it showed the awards.)
</P>
<P>
   Try, too, explaining to those not steeped in Oscar lore why the
event matters -- why, for instance, there's a unique delirium to be
gleaned from Rob Lowe cavorting about the stage with Snow White or
from acceptance speeches so daft that they constitute their own
aberrant genius.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, the British don't really care about awards and tend
to look sympathetically (and more than a shade patronizingly) at
those who behave as if such things matter.
</P>
<P>
   For proof, just consider Britain's Oscar equivalent, the annual
BAFTAs, a tedious proceeding held several weeks after the Oscars
that are of no entertainment value and even less box-office
influence.
</P>
<P>
   That might explain why the guest list for a local Oscar
gathering each year never reaches far into the double digits, and
why expatriate Americans inevitably make up most of those on hand.
English friends annually announce their interest in coming, only to
bow out when the prospect of staying up all night gets closer.
</P>
<P>
   And who can blame them? Unless you've got Oscar in the blood,
why would you cross a deserted capital at 1 a.m. to join a group of
demented insomniacs?
</P>
<P>
   As for placing bets on categories you've never heard of
(''what's 'best sound effects editing?''' I am annually asked),
rare is the Briton prepared to wager hard-earned cash on the truism
that any Oscar pertaining to sound tends to go to the year's
noisiest film.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of loud, make sure you're in a house -- not an apartment
-- when your favorite nominee wins. Otherwise, you'll have to endure
a year of sharp glances from neighbors who don't understand Oscar
season's abiding truth: When it comes to the Academy Awards,
decorum off-screen as well as on is devoutly not to be wished.

<HEADLINE> Clancy's Ex-Wife Gets Orioles Stake  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Author Tom Clancy has given his ex-wife half of
his interest in the Baltimore Orioles as part of their divorce
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy, who penned such military thrillers as ''The Hunt for Red
October'' and ''Patriot Games,'' and ex-wife Wanda each now own
about 12 percent of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy was part of an investment group that paid $173 million
for the Orioles in 1993. He and his ex-wife are the second-biggest
shareholders in the team, behind lawyer Peter Angelos.
</P>
<P>
   Wanda Clancy's attorney, Sheila K. Sachs, said her client was
always the baseball fan in the Clancy household.
</P>
<P>
   ''She really is a fan. She's a Marylander,'' Sachs said.

<HEADLINE> Hewitt Needs Boost for Hepburn Movie  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Jennifer Love Hewitt needed a boost to fill the
shoes of the late Audrey Hepburn, whom she portrays in an upcoming
TV movie.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm only 5 feet 2, so I was on apple boxes in a lot of the
scenes with my leading men,'' Hewitt says in Sunday's Parade
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old actress plays the 5-foot-8 Hepburn from age 18
to 32 in ''The Audrey Hepburn Story,'' which airs Monday on ABC.
Unlike Hepburn, who had to be dubbed in ''My Fair Lady,'' Hewitt
does her own singing in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt, who stars in ''Time of Your Life'' -- a ''Party of Five''
spin-off -- says she landed the Hepburn role while talking with the
show's producer, Kimberly Rubin, about something else.
</P>
<P>
   ''I mentioned that my role model was Audrey Hepburn,'' Hewitt
said. ''She said she'd been dreaming for five years of doing a
movie about her. And I said I'd been dreaming for 11 years of
playing her!''

<HEADLINE> No longer the automotive wunderkind, DeLorean ousted from estate  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEDMINSTER, N.J. (AP) -- In the 1960s, John Z. DeLorean was the
bad boy of Detroit, a flamboyant young executive seemingly destined
to lead General Motors, then the world's biggest industrial
company.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he has been evicted from his 434-acre estate in the rolling
hills of New Jersey's moneyed hunt country, his home for nearly 20
years. It was sold at a court-ordered bankruptcy auction to provide
some compensation for his creditors.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, only a longtime friend and two Great Pyrenees dogs
were at the three-story brick Georgian mansion at the end of a
mile-long mostly gravel driveway.
</P>
<P>
   The man, who asked that his name not be used, said DeLorean
asked him to guard against scavengers. The dogs had grown up on the
property and would probably remain, perhaps cared for by tenants,
the man said.
</P>
<P>
   The day before, movers loaded furnishings into vans so the goods
could be warehoused before being liquidated for the creditors, as
the 75-year-old DeLorean watched.
</P>
<P>
   He told reporters he hoped his adult children would prevail in
their appeal to prove they had a lifetime claim to the property and
declined to say where he would be living.
</P>
<P>
   Messages left this week for the court-appointed bankruptcy
trustee, who is to be notified of DeLorean's address, were not
returned.
</P>
<P>
   DeLorean quit GM in 1973 as vice president in charge of its
North American car and truck operations to launch his own car
company in Northern Ireland several years later.
</P>
<P>
   DeLorean produced nearly 9,000 of his self-named sports cars in
three years, notable for their gull-wing doors and unpainted
stainless-steel skin.
</P>
<P>
   The company collapsed after he was arrested in 1982, accused in
a sting of conspiring to sell $24 million of cocaine to salvage his
venture.
</P>
<P>
   He used an entrapment defense to win acquittal, but wrestled
with 40 other legal cases in the ensuing years and his debts grew.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear his appeal of a
jury award of $4.7 million in legal fees -- $8 million with interest
-- owed to lawyer Mayer Morganroth in Southfield, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   DeLorean claimed he was overbilled and had no money. He owed his
largest creditor, Merrill Lynch Credit Corp., $11 million on loans.
</P>
<P>
   He declared bankruptcy in September 1999, asserting that the
Chapter 11 reorganization would not only pay each creditor 100
percent by developing his land into golf courses and an equestrian
center -- but give him money to build a ''radical new car.''
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in January 2000 approved the sale of the estate
to a golf course developer, National Fairways Inc., of Fairfield,
Conn., for $15.25 million, about half his total debt. The money is
earmarked for his creditors.
</P>
<P>
   National Fairways, which was not among the creditors, plans to
build a private golf club and possibly some homes, a vice
president, Harry Rosenblum, said this week.
</P>
<P>
   DeLorean's distant neighbors in Bedminster included publisher
and ex-presidential candidate Steve Forbes, while Gov. Christie
Whitman resides in nearby Tewksbury.
</P>
<P>
   Also nearby is John J. Trombadore, the lawyer who represented
DeLorean in his widely reported 1985 divorce from model Cristina
Ferrare, his third wife.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's nothing short of a tragedy that he finds himself
in the position he finds himself in today,'' Trombadore said
recently. ''But for circumstances out of his control, he could have
been one of the most successful industrialists this country has
ever seen.''

   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Novelist Anne Rice is paying for a
groundskeeper, a cook and 10 other people from her Catholic parish
to fly to Rome for the beatification of a priest buried in their
church.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II will declare Father Francis Xavier Seelos

<P>
   Seelos, who died of yellow fever, will be the fifth person who
served mainly in the United States to be declared blessed or a
saint.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fr. Seelos is especially dear to me because my ancestors
include both Irish and Germans who lived in St. Alphonsus Parish,
people who no doubt had to cope with the scourge of yellow fever,
and some who may even have known Fr. Seelos personally,'' Rice
wrote in a statement Thursday.

   SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) -- Brad Pitt's mom is miffed by an
impersonator who is giving her golden boy a bad reputation in his

   Sporting a black cowboy hat, a goatee and even his own entourage

young women.

   ''It is very irritating to me,'' Jane Pitt said Wednesday.
''When he goes out, it's usually with family. Brad doesn't get home
enough that he spends time holding court in downtown Springfield.''

   The real Brad, she insists, was on the West Coast last week
rehearsing his new movie, ''The Mexican,'' with co-star Julia

<HEADLINE> Technology Stocks Rally  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks rallied for a fourth straight
session today but the broader market was mixed as blue chips fell
back from a big early advance.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite was up
87.75 at 5,028.36, flirting with the March 10 closing mark of
5,048.62. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 10.33 at 1,537.68,
padding Thursday's record close.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 23.89 at 11,095.97,
retreating from a 115-point gain this morning. The Dow, which rose
253 points Thursday, has gained more than 500 points this week, but
still sits more than 500 points below the closing record of
11,722.98 set Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Before trading began, the government reported orders to U.S.
factories for big-ticket equipment and machinery fell 2.3 percent
in February, the largest decline in 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger-than-expected drop, which followed a 2.2 percent
decline in January, could help ease some concerns that the Federal
Reserve will keep fighting inflationary pressures by slowing the
economy with higher interest rates. The central bank raised its
short-term lending rates again on Tuesday, the fifth increase since
last summer, and many analysts expect the Fed will boost rates
again.
</P>
<P>
   Standouts today included Internet equipment maker Cisco Systems,
which jumped to another record high, rising 1 3/16 to 79 as the
most active Nasdaq issue.
</P>
<P>
   Online brokerages were sharply higher amid expectations of
strong profits. ETrade rose 4 to 31~ and Wit Capital rose 3~ to 20
7/16.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson slid 8{ to 71{ -- or the equivalent of more
than 40 Dow points -- after Thursday's announcement that the company
will stop marketing Propulsid, a popular heartburn drug that has
been associated with 80 deaths. The Dow's biggest gainers were 3M,
up 4 15/16 at 91 15/16, and IBM, up 4 11/16 at 119 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   In other trading today, advancing issues outnumbered decliners
by a 10-to-9 margin on the New York Stock Exchange, while Nasdaq
decliners led by a 10-to-9 ratio. The Russell 2000 index of smaller
companies was up 5.62 at 579.41.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume came to 728.85 million shares, up from Thursday's
afternoon tally of 710.97 million.

<HEADLINE> $10M Fine Against Railroad Rescinds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Admitting that he erred in a
wrongful-death lawsuit, a judge has rescinded a $10 million fine
against Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge Bob McGrath had declared a mistrial after
two weeks of testimony and fined the Fort Worth-based railroad last
week, accusing it of misrepresenting a railroad distance signal
shown to jurors.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, McGrath said his sanctions were premature because
they were announced without a hearing. He also removed himself from
the civil case.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are pleased with the order and the setting aside of
sanctions,'' railroad spokesman Richard Russack said.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of Randy Mann, a 43-year-old Burlington Northern
engineer, had sued over his death in 1993 collision in Enid, Okla.
They claimed the crew members lost their bearings in heavy fog and
collided with a second train because the signal was not working.
</P>
<P>
   The signal no longer exists. The judge had said that the signal
prepared by the railroad was not typical of the original.

<HEADLINE> National Archives Fire 'Intentional'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A fire that destroyed thousands of pages of
records at a National Archives storage center just outside
Washington was intentionally set, investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   ''The investigation has revealed that the fire was of suspicious
origin,'' Mike Campbell, a spokesman for the Baltimore division of
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said Friday. ''There
are several people they are looking at closely.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire occurred Feb. 29 at the Washington National Records
Center in Suitland, Md., which stores more than 3.7 million cubic
feet of records. Archives officials initially believed that as many
as 700,000 pages were damaged or destroyed. But Susan Cooper, a
spokeswoman for the archives, said it now appears that fewer than
40,000 pages were actually destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the records kept in the area where sprinklers went
off were inactive files of deceased war veterans from the
Department of Veterans Affairs. The other records were from the
Bureau of Indian Affairs; the Labor Department's hour and wage
division; the U.S. Patent and Trademark office; and District of
Columbia government offices.
</P>
<P>
   Conservation work is under way. Wet documents are being stored
in about five refrigerated trucks to prevent mold and mildew. Then
they are put into drying chambers kept at more than 90 degrees,
Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're basically back in business,'' Cooper said. ''One major
problem remains: We need to have the walls, floors and boxes
professionally cleaned so that all the soot and smoke residue are
removed.''

<HEADLINE> Again, church mourns a college student killed by fire  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUNELLEN, N.J. (AP) -- It was the same church and the same scene:
Hundreds of college students, shaking with sobs, filed into the
sanctuary on a sunny day to mourn a college student killed by fire.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, the mourners at St. John the Evangelist Roman
Catholic Church were saying goodbye to Aaron Karol, one of three
Seton Hall University students who died in a fire at their freshman
dormitory. On Friday, they came to grieve for Cliff Vail, one of
three Bloomsburg University students killed last weekend in a
fraternity house fire near the campus in northeastern Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have lost two of your beloved sons in circumstances
terribly, tragically similar,'' Bloomsburg University president
Jessica Kozloff told the congregation at St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   Vail, 21, died Sunday in a fire at the Tau Kappa Epsilon
fraternity house, hours after a big party let out.
</P>
<P>
   Also killed were Marcus LaBuda, 21, of Hazleton, Pa; and
Kristoffer Polhemus, 21, of Hampton. Funeral services for Polhemus
were scheduled for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   More than 500 people crowded into St. John's to say goodbye to
Vail, standing against the walls on both sides of the church, in
the balcony and in the foyer.
</P>
<P>
   Many were Vail's TKE fraternity brothers and other friends from
college. Pennsylvania license plates made up half of the motorcade
leaving the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want you to know Cliff had a family at Bloomsburg
University, too,'' Kozloff told Vail's parents, Cliff and Diane,
sister Alyssa and brother Drew.
</P>
<P>
   ''Your son's life was short, but look at this church,'' the Rev.
Richard Lyons told Vail's parents, Clifford and Diane. Lyons said
that Vail, a three-sport athlete in high school despite his size --
5-foot-7 and 140 pounds -- touched many lives.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons called Vail's death a senseless tragedy, but urged
mourners to have faith and hope.
</P>
<P>
   ''We gather this day in sadness, in anger, grief, shock,'' Lyons
said. ''If we remain rooted in those emotions then tragedy wins. We
can not let it win.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashley Wagner, a sister of one of Vail's former high school
girlfriends, stood and read a poem, asking ''Why was it him God had
to pick?'' She kissed her hand and placed it on Vail's coffin
before returning to her seat.
</P>
<P>
   As at Karol's funeral two months before, young mourners sobbed
openly, hugging each other and praying.
</P>
<P>
   Karol, of Green Brook, died along with Frank Caltabilota Jr.,
18, of West Long Branch, and Justin Giunta, 18, of Vineland, in the
Jan. 19 dorm fire at Seton Hall. Sixty-two people were injured,
four critically. One student remained hospitalized in critical
condition Friday with severe burns.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of that fire remains under investigation.

<HEADLINE> Factory Orders Drop 2.3 Percent  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Slackening demand for airplanes and industrial
machinery helped send orders for big-ticket goods plunging in
February, prompting economists to wonder whether the economy
finally is beginning to slow.
</P>
<P>
   It was biggest drop in 10 months for durable goods, the second
month in a row that orders fell to U.S. factories for items
expected to last at least three years, the Commerce Department said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Orders slipped by a bigger-than-expected 2.3 percent to a
seasonally adjusted $208.4 billion, following a 2.2 percent drop in
January.
</P>
<P>
   ''The two consecutive declines raise the question: 'Has the
slowdown finally begun?' It may have, but if so, it is not yet a
major one,'' said Joel Naroff of Naroff Economics.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve bumped up interest rates Tuesday for the
fifth time since June 30, a tactic to slow the speeding economy and
keep inflation from becoming a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Given the outlook for continuing strong economic growth, many
analysts expect the Fed will boost rates again May 16. At this
point, economists said they did not believe Friday's
weaker-than-expected durable-goods report by itself would alter
that view.
</P>
<P>
   February's performance marked the biggest drop in durable-goods
order since a 2.4 percent decline in April.
</P>
<P>
   ''Growth is slowing as sure as spring is arriving,'' said
National Association of Manufacturers economist Gordon Richards.
Richards believed the report ''confirms the emergence of a
slowdown'' in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Weaker demand for airplanes and other transportation equipment
led the decline in overall durable-goods orders.
</P>
<P>
   Orders for transportation equipment fell 8.7 percent, the
steepest drop since April. That followed a 7.2 percent decline in
such orders in January.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding the volatile transportation category, overall
durable-goods orders fell by 0.2 percent in February, a second
consecutive monthly decline.
</P>
<P>
   Also contributing to the decline in overall durable-goods orders
was industrial machinery, including computers and machine tools,
which fell by 4.6 percent in February after a 10 percent rise the
month before.
</P>
<P>
   Orders for primary metals, the category that includes steel,
fell by 2.4 percent last month after posting a 4.6 percent gain in
January.
</P>
<P>
   And shipments of big-ticket goods, a good sign of current
demand, fell 1.8 percent in February. That followed a 1.5 percent
rise the month before.
</P>
<P>
   There were bright spots in the report.
</P>
<P>
   Orders rose for electronics and electrical equipment, including
semiconductors, circuit boards and home appliances, by a strong 6.4
percent in February after a 10.1 percent drop in January.
</P>
<P>
   Even with February's 2.3 percent drop in demand for big-ticket
items, overall durable-goods orders are running 6.6 percent higher
in the first two months of this year than in the corresponding
period last year.
</P>
<P>
   In a report this month, the National Association of Purchasing
Management said the industrial economy grew briskly in February,
suggesting that the manufacturing sector and the economy continue
to possess momentum.
</P>
<P>
   The purchasing managers' report and the durable-goods report,
which is often volatile from month to month because it includes big
purchases such as airplanes, appear to offer conflicting signals as
to where the economy is heading.
</P>
<P>
   Given that, some economists said they would need to see
additional economic data showing a softening in a number of
sectors, including manufacturing, before they are willing to
conclude that an economic slowdown has in fact begun.
</P>
<P>
   ''The report raises a cautionary flag, but I think it would be a
little bit premature to start playing taps for manufacturing,''
said Paul Kasriel, chief economist for the Northern Trust Co.

   US Air Union Reports Some Progress
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As time runs out for a last attempt at
mediation, some progress has been made in US Airways negotiations
with disgruntled flight attendants who are threatening a walkout,
union officials said today. But at a news conference at the Ronald
Reagan National Airport, Pat Friend, president of the Association
of Flight Attendants, flanked by US Airways flight attendants, said
the union is still preparing for the possibility of a strike
starting at midnight tonight. US Airways officials said they are
focused on reaching an agreement, but repeated vows to shut down
the airline rather than try to weather a strike.

   EU Leaders Pursue High-Tech Economy
</P>
<P>
   LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- Leaders of the European Union issued an
ambitious call today for the old continent to join the new economic
tide: information technologies, labor flexibility, privatization
and entrepreneurs. Leaders of the 15 EU nations pledged measures to
increase e-commerce, deregulate the telecommunications, energy,
postal and transport sectors, and reform labor laws, but set no
deadline for the changes. The EU's belated commitment to unlock the
Internet's potential stems from concern that the United States has
opened a strong lead in profiting from information and
communications technology.

   Congress Mulls Break on Gas Taxes

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Struggling to find a political answer to
rising oil prices, Senate Republican leaders are pushing for a
temporary rollback of federal gasoline taxes as their House
counterparts draft longer-term tax breaks intended to boost
domestic production. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
introduced a pair of gas-tax bills this week. One would roll back
until January the 4.3-cents-a-gallon increase imposed in 1993. The
other would enact a temporary ''tax holiday'' and suspend the
18.4-cents-per-gallon federal gas tax if pump prices top $2 a
gallon this year.

   DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) -- German steelmaker ThyssenKrupp AG is
looking for ways to cooperate with the engineering and automotive
subsidiary of Mannesmann AG, the conglomerate that agreed last
month to be acquired by British telecommunications giant Vodafone
AirTouch PLC. ThyssenKrupp said today it would like to reach a
wide-ranging pact that includes all activities of Mannesman's Atecs
unit. Mannesmann had planned to spin off Atecs as a separate

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Shares of Johnson &AMP; Johnson tumbled nearly 10

conglomerate's decision late yesterday to stop marketing the
heartburn drug Propulsid. Propulsid has been linked to 80 deaths
since 1993 and a variety of serious cardiac problems in hundreds of
patients. Shares of J&AMP;J were down 8 11/16 to 71 5/16 on the New

<HEADLINE> Shipping Thefts Kept Secret  </HEADLINE>
By CHAD ROEDEMEIER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The disappearance of 55 Oscar statuettes from a
shipping company last week show that almost any package is
vulnerable to being stolen.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's probably a hundred different ways to steal stuff,''
said Mason Kauffman, a former FedEx employee who now owns an
on-line shipping service, Accuship.com.
</P>
<P>
   While billions of packages make it to their destinations without
incident, shipping companies do lose millions of dollars in
packages to employee theft. But few companies are willing to reveal
how widespread the problem is.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Black, spokesman for Atlanta-based UPS, said only a small
percentage of that company's employees steal merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ''We run a very large network with literally 340,000 employees,
so we are a reflection of society,'' Black said. ''It's going to
happen occasionally, but we have systems and procedures in place to
prevent it.''
</P>
<P>
   FedEx spokeswoman Carla Boyd responded to a reporter's query by
saying, ''numbers like that we don't release.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kauffman said FedEx knows exactly how many packages
disappear every year. During his 17 years at FedEx, the company
based in Memphis, Tenn., kept precise statistics on its ''loss
ratio,'' but never revealed the number to anyone outside the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Only the U.S. Postal Service had no problem releasing its theft
numbers -- partly because officials are proud of its prevention and
enforcement efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Postal inspector Robert Bethel said about 500 employees were
arrested for mail theft in fiscal year 1999 -- that's less than a
tenth of 1 percent of its 800,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's such a taboo to fool with the mail,'' Bethel said. ''Many
of our tips come from postal employees because they take this
commitment so seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Roadway Express driver Lawrence Edward Ledent of Los
Angeles was charged with stealing the Oscars, which were later
recovered from a trash bin. He has pleaded innocent to a single
count of grand theft.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials charge that Ledent stole the shipment the same
day it arrived in a warehouse in Bell, Calif. Prosecutors declined
to charge a second Roadway employee pending further investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Police haven't given out any details of how the Oscars were
taken.
</P>
<P>
   Kauffman said employees sometimes simply take the goods out of a
package and ship an empty box, Kauffman said. Shipping dock
workers, many of whom are not highly paid, can put a new address
label on a package and mail it to their own address or a friend's.
The box disappears from the company's system, and there are few
ways of tracking it, Kauffman said.
</P>
<P>
   Four United Parcel Service employees were arrested in 1997 for
running a similar scheme in San Francisco. Police said they stole
guns, computers, cameras and stereo equipment by pasting fake
address labels on the shipments.
</P>
<P>
   Shippers were reluctant to discuss what kind of measures they
take to try to prevent theft, saying they want to be sure their
security systems remain effective.
</P>
<P>
   Kauffman said the best way to stop internal theft is to use
computer tracking systems. By scanning a barcode at each step on
the way, he said, shipping companies can know where a package was
last seen if it goes missing.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Turn Lower on Profit Taking  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned mostly lower today as investors
took some profits from Wall Street's big runup this week. The Dow
Jones industrials fell as Johnson &AMP; Johnson tumbled after pulling a
popular drug from the market.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the
Nasdaq composite was up 1.80 at 4,942.41, having given up an early
gain of as much as 138 points. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
down 2.44 at 1,524.91, dipping from Thursday's record close.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow was down 35.99 at 11,083.87, retreating from a 115-point
gain this morning. The Dow, which rose 253 points Thursday, has
gained more than 500 points this week, but still sits more than 500
points below the closing record of 11,722.98 set Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson slid 9[ to 70~ -- or the equivalent of more
than 40 Dow points -- after Thursday's announcement that the company
will stop marketing Propulsid, a popular heartburn drug that has
been associated with 80 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's biggest gainers were 3M, up 4} at 91}, and IBM, up 5\
at 120{.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, Internet equipment maker Cisco Systems, pushed to
another record high, rising 13/16 to 78| as the most active Nasdaq
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Online brokerages were sharply higher amid expectations of
strong profits. ETrade rose 3 11/16 to 31 9/16 and Wit Capital rose
3~ to 20 7/16. Wit, whose business lines include investment banking
and extended-hours trading, said that in mid-April, it expects to
report its first profitable quarter since going public in June.
</P>
<P>
   A robust outlook for corporate profits should help most stocks
advance in the coming weeks, said Alan Ackerman, senior vice
president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''The magnet for money right now is improving corporate
earnings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Before trading began, the government reported orders to U.S.
factories for big-ticket equipment and machinery fell 2.3 percent
in February, the largest decline in 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger-than-expected drop, which followed a 2.2 percent
decline in January, could help ease some concerns that the Federal
Reserve will keep fighting inflationary pressures by slowing the
economy with higher interest rates. The central bank raised its
short-term lending rates again on Tuesday, the fifth increase since
last summer, and many analysts expect the Fed will boost rates
again.
</P>
<P>
   In other trading today, advancing issues outnumbered decliners
by a 10-to-9 margin on the New York Stock Exchange, while Nasdaq
decliners led by a 10-to-9 ratio. The Russell 2000 index of smaller
companies was up 0.42 at 574.21.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume came to 851.09 million shares, down from Thursday's
afternoon tally of 851.73 million.

<HEADLINE> Pope Delivers Own Sermon on Mount  </HEADLINE>
By VICTOR L. SIMPSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KORAZIM, Israel (AP) -- Pope John Paul II delivered his own
Sermon on the Mount on Friday, preaching Christ's message against
evil and hate before multitudes of muddy young believers -- many of
them pilgrims from faraway lands who had gathered on this hill near
where the Bible says Jesus walked on water.
</P>
<P>
   Some 100,000 people -- the largest crowd of the pontiff's Holy
Land pilgrimage -- stood shoulder-to-shoulder on the Mount of
Beatitudes for the papal Mass. Overlooking the Sea of Galilee, the
79-year-old pontiff warned the faithful against temptations.
</P>
<P>
   ''To be good Christians may seem beyond your strength in today's
world. But Jesus does not stand by and leave you alone in the face
of challenge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was here at the Sea of Galilee that the Gospels tell of
Christ performing miracles, preaching to the multitudes and
gathering his disciples to him. Near the pope's altar for Friday's
Mass is the spot where, Matthew's Gospel recounts, Christ recited
the Beatitudes: ''Blessed are the poor in spirit; for theirs is the
kingdom of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn; for they shall be
comforted...''
</P>
<P>
   The pope, in ivory-and-gold robes, directed his remarks to
thousands of young people, most from faraway lands -- Africa, Latin
America, the Far East.
</P>
<P>
   After heavy rains overnight, the soggy grounds left the pilgrims
muddy but heady in anticipation of this modern sermon. Piles of
sleeping bags and backpacks were strewn across the hillside. Some
pilgrims huddled for warmth under blankets as they sat on plastic
sheeting, and others held white candles and sang hymns.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the most important message that could be,'' said
Stefania Esposito, 28, of Salerno, Italy, who like many in the
crowd had traveled to the Holy Land as part of a Christian youth
group. ''We all need to be forgiven by God and each other.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I see the pope not as an idol, but as a person who helps
others understand the meaning of life,'' said Josh Lizama, 17, a
high school student from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The multitude fell quiet when the pope began to speak, warning
against ''those who prosper at any cost, who are unscrupulous,
pitiless, devious, who make war not peace, who persecute those who
stand in their way.''
</P>
<P>
   On each side of the pope were bulletproof glass shields, part of
the precautions taken by Israel in the largest security operation
in the country's history. Only once before on a papal trip, in
Detroit in 1987, had bulletproof glass been placed on the altar.
</P>
<P>
   The frail pontiff was holding up remarkably well on the fifth
day of his weeklong pilgrimage. He spoke in a strong voice,
appeared in top spirits and even negotiated 30 steps with the help
of his cane to pray at a chapel after a lakeside meeting with
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course he is feeling well,'' said papal spokesman Joaquin
Navarro-Valls. ''This trip is very important to him.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also a day free of controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Since arriving in Israel from Jordan on Tuesday, both the Jewish
state and the Palestinians have hurled their competing claims over
Jerusalem before the pope. It even extended to an interreligious
meeting meant to promote harmony among Jews, Christians and Muslims
that ended after a Jewish rabbi and a Muslim cleric angered each
other and the cleric left abruptly.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the pope was upset by the scene at the meeting
Thursday evening, his spokesman said: ''It was a photograph of the
situation, the reality that exists.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, politics did creep into the Mass. One group of
Palestinians living in Lebanon held up banners demanding they be
allowed to return to their village in Israel, from which they were
expelled following the 1948 Mideast war. Another sign urged Israel
not to pull out of south Lebanon, as the government plans to do by
July.
</P>
<P>
   The number of those attending from Christian communities in
Israel, Lebanon, the Palestinian territories and elsewhere in the
region was small -- Christians are a diminishing minority in the
Middle East. One of the pope's aims in this pilgrimage was to
reassure and reinforce Christians who feel squeezed by the violence
that has wracked the region.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, John Paul went to the limestone church built
on the site where, tradition says, Jesus multiplied two fishes and
five loaves of bread to feed 5,000 people. He next visited a church
built upon a rock where Christ is said to have chosen the apostle
Peter to lead his church. John Paul prayed before a stone
outcropping inside the church, then leaned over and kissed it.
</P>
<P>
   As twilight set in, he braved a light drizzle to gaze out over
the Galilee, the town of Tiberias visible in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   The pope also stopped at a ruin that Byzantine-era Christians,
observing a local tradition, said had been Peter's house just
centuries earlier. There the pontiff sat on a white throne. After
praying, he was joined by 10 prelates in his entourage and they
sang together a hymn in Latin: ''You are Peter.''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul is the successor to Peter, considered the first pope.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Squatters Not Evicted  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Police in Zimbabwe said Friday they
cannot evict ex-guerrillas and other squatters illegally camped on
white-owned farms without risking bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement to the High Court in Harare, Deputy Police
Commissioner Godwin Matanga said land occupations were
''politically charged'' and ''ready to explode if not handled with
great care and political astuteness.''
</P>
<P>
   Matanga asked the court to revise its March 17 ruling, which
ordered police to evict the squatters by March 21 or arrest them if
they refused to leave the farms. Police did neither.
</P>
<P>
   ''Police are not prepared to undertake an intervention which in
their view might risk some of the members of the (farmers) being
killed,'' Matanga said in documents submitted to the High Court.
''As long as demonstrations remain peaceful, police should keep
their distance.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, the police have done just that, despite an eviction
order granted by Judge Paddington Garwe in response to a complaint
by the Commercial Farmers' Union, which represents about 4,000
white farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Since Feb. 19, veterans of the bush war that led to independence
in 1980 and other squatters armed with spears, axes, clubs and guns
have staked out claims on 731 white-owned farms, and set up camps
on more than 400 of them.
</P>
<P>
   Matanga argued that police should remain on hand -- but not
intervene -- until a solution can found to the squatters' protests
about inequalities in land ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Some 4,000 white farmers own about a third of the country's
productive land. About 1.5 million black families live on the rest.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers' group has called on the police to respect the
judge's order, and is reportedly preparing a request for a
contempt-of-court order against President Robert Mugabe, top police
officials and a leader of the squatters movement.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers say the situation has already become violent.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer Schalk Nel was charged with attempted murder after
retaliating against squatters in scuffles near the northwestern
farming center of Karoi on Thursday, said lawyer Alex Masterson.
</P>
<P>
   Nel and his workers had fought off advancing squatters. No
firearms were used.
</P>
<P>
   The fight was one of several clashes in recent days where farm
workers turned against squatters in an effort to protect their
jobs, union leaders said. No serious injuries have been reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''Things have become very tense,'' said Terry Smit, another
Karoi farmer. The squatters ''are rabid, they are screaming racial
abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe's popularity has slumped sharply as Zimbabwe suffers from
its worst economic crisis since the country, formerly known as
Rhodesia, gained independence from Britain in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers say the ruling party is allowing squatters to remain on
farms to garner support ahead of anticipated parliamentary
elections.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Futures Sink, Soybeans Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A changing weather outlook in the central United
States sent wheat prices diving while other grains and soybeans
climbed Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat futures sank to a three-month low on forecasts for further
rain in the winter wheat belt, already socked by substantial
precipitation. The selloff came after wheat had marched higher in
lockstep with corn and soybeans early in the session.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans, meanwhile, soared after forecasters scaled back their
projections of weekend rains in key growing regions of the Midwest,
and also called for dry weather for much of next week. The storm
system that has pelted the southern and central Plains states is
weakening as it moves east.
</P>
<P>
   Corn rose moderately higher for similar reasons, as the revised
forecasts renewed concerns about drought impact in the corn belt.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for May delivery fell 3{ cents to $2.52} a bushel; May
corn rose 1} cent to $2.32 a bushel; May oats rose } cent to $1.20{
a bushel; May soybeans rose 8} cents to $5.30} a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Beef and pork futures finished mostly higher on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   April live cattle were unchanged at 73.02 cents a pound; May
feeder cattle rose .10 cent to 84.37 cents a pound; June lean hogs
rose .57 cent to 67.57 cents a pound; May pork bellies rose .05
cent to 88.85 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Radar Woes Slow Maryland Airport  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINTHICUM, Md. (AP) -- A computer malfunction delayed flights at
Baltimore-Washington International Airport and left air traffic
controllers relying on computer printouts and handwritten notes
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The computer system that usually provides the names, altitudes
and speeds of aircraft malfunctioned from about 8 a.m. to 11:30
a.m., the Federal Aviation Administration said.
</P>
<P>
   Controllers were still able to track planes on their radar
screens, but details about the aircraft were incomplete, said
Arlene Salac, an FAA spokeswoman. The controllers compensated by
using flight data strips about each aircraft and marking any
changes, such as altitude or speed, by hand, Salac said.
</P>
<P>
   To give the controllers more time for tracking, the normal
three-mile separation between planes was stretched to 15 to 20
miles, the FAA said.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-three departing flights and some incoming flights were
delayed an average of 25 minutes, Salac said.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA is investigating the cause.

<HEADLINE> U.S.: Iraq Helps Iran Opposition  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Iraq has spent tens of millions of dollars
building a military base for an Iranian opposition group linked by
U.S. officials to terror activities around the world, the State
Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman James P. Rubin said the Iraqi activity demonstrates
that President Saddam Hussein, whose country remains under
international sanctions, is choosing not to use scarce resources to
benefit Iraqis but rather to sponsor terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The group in question is the MEK, the Mujahedeen Khalq
Organization of Iran, or the People's Holy Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   The MEK said in a statement from its office in Paris that
Rubin's allegation is an ''absolute lie. The people's Mujahedeen of
Iran has not even received one dollar from any government,
including Iraq.'' The group said it will file a lawsuit to contest
the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said the MEK is thought to have in Iraq approximately a
division's worth of heavy equipment -- tanks, armored personnel
carriers and artillery -- to conduct raids, bombings and mortar
attacks in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin showed reporters a newly declassified aerial photo of the
four-square-mile base. He said it is expected to accommodate
between 3,000 to 5,000 MEK fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ''When it becomes operational, in our judgment, it will be used
to coordinate MEK terrorist activities and to plan attacks against
targets in Iran and elsewhere,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   He denied his comments were related to recent U.S. overtures to
Iran, including an easing of trade sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, he said, Iraq's activities against Iran are
occurring even as Iranian officials are facilitating illicit Iraqi
oil shipments through the Persian Gulf. These shipments are
estimated to net Saddam revenues in the hundreds if million of
dollars. Iran and Iraq fought a brutal war between 1980 and 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin noted that the MEK has been designated a foreign terrorist
organization, and, as such, donations to the group are illegal by
people in the United States. Group members also are generally
denied U.S. visas.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman disclosed the Iraqi activities as U.S. officials
at the United Nations were releasing $100 million worth of goods
Baghdad can buy through the U.N. humanitarian program.
</P>
<P>
   The administration also was introducing a resolution doubling
the amount of oil industry spare parts Iraq can purchase, but made
clear it would still check each contract to make sure it isn't used
for military purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has been barred from selling oil on the open market since
sweeping sanctions were imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
The U.N. oil-for-food program was launched in 1996 to help Iraqis
suffering under the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   While more than $6 billion worth of goods have arrived in Iraq
since the program began, the United States has held up more than $1
billion in contracts for equipment to rebuild Iraq's aging
electricity, oil and water industries.
</P>
<P>
   Washington says it wants to make sure the equipment isn't used
to help Saddam rebuild his weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Family Proposes Arbitrator  </HEADLINE>
By MILDRADE CHERFILS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's Florida relatives proposed today
the appointment of an independent arbitrator to determine whether
sending the boy back to Cuba or allowing him to stay here was in
his best interest. Federal officials rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal came after the government demanded that the family
take swift steps to return the 6-year-old boy to his father in
Cuba. The ultimatum came in the wake of a federal judge's ruling
this week affirming the U.S. government's decision to send Elian
back.
</P>
<P>
   In their offer, attorneys for the Florida relatives said the
arbitration process could begin April 3 and be completed within two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter to the Immigration and Naturalization Service's
Civil Litigation Division, the attorneys offered to abide by such
an arbitrator's decision and ''forgo any avenues of appeal
whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys said they would work with the INS in selecting the
arbitrator, suggesting former Sen. Bob Dole or Sen. George Mitchell
for the position.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the INS would agree at last to provide a day in court to
this small child, the result would be not only a fair determination
of what's right for Elian, but a much faster resolution than is
possible through further court battles,'' the attorneys wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, INS Comissioner Doris Meissner rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not an option that we are prepared to entertain,'' she
said. ''In determining that Elian's father can speak for him in
immigration matters, I made a decision that was lawful and within
my administrative discretion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department issued its ultimatum Thursday, asking for
a response by noon Friday. The agency wanted the relatives to agree
to a speedy timetable for their appeal of Tuesday's federal court
decision against them or the agency would ''immediately move to
revoke'' Elian's status in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, however, has not set a deadline for
the boy's return except to say that she wants it to happen in an
''orderly, fair and prompt'' manner.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was found clinging to an inner tube off Florida on Nov.
25. His mother and 10 other people drowned when their boat capsized
during an attempt to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The case quickly became a tug-of-war between the Cuban
government and U.S. family members who oppose the Cuban
government's Communist ideology and want to raise the boy.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Make Proposal to Assad  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will try to clarify Syria's
''needs and requirements'' for peace with Israel when he meets
Sunday with President Hafez Assad, a senior U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no precooked aspect to this,'' State Department
spokesman James P. Rubin said Friday about the meeting Clinton and
Assad have scheduled in Geneva, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   After Israeli-Syrian talks in Shepherdstown, W.Va., broke down
in mid-January the Clinton administration turned to secret
diplomacy. Clinton's meeting with Assad was set up in the hopes
negotiations could be resumed and then produce a treaty under which
Israel withdrew on the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that a face-to-face meeting is the next logical
step in this process,'' Rubin said. ''We have worked with both
sides to try to clarify the needs and the requirements in order to
get the two sides' objectives met.''
</P>
<P>
   What Clinton will say and how Assad will respond are not being
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, the president will have something to say to
President Assad, and we'll have to see what he has to say back,''
Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting is the third major exchange and the first in six
years between Clinton and the Syrian leader. U.S. overtures to
Syria have not be sidetracked by the State Department's finding
that Syria supports terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   A treaty with Israel is bound to include Israeli abandonment of
the Golan Heights security area and U.S. technology intended as a
substitute to protect villages in northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Syria is likely to seek American assistance, as well. But
nations branded as sponsors of terrorism are barred by law from
virtually all aid.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's Mideast adviser Dennis Ross will join the President in
Geneva. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will be there, as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have meetings like this if we don't have something to
say,'' Rubin told reporters here. ''Obviously, the President will
have something to say to President Assad, and we'll have to see
what he has to say back.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Washington, meanwhile, Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators decided to extend their inconclusive talks into next
week, still ''brainstorming'' over the future of Jerusalem,
Palestinian aspirations for a state and other knotty issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's too early to know if this will lead to anything,'' Hassan
Abdel Rahman, the chief PLO representative in Washington, said of
the negotiations being held at screened-off Bolling Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli official, meanwhile, said the ''chemistry'' was good
at the talks southeast Washington.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday's meetings the Israelis and Palestinians scheduled
a break for the Jewish Sabbath, beginning at sundown, and plan to
resume Saturday night. Rahman said they would meet next week, as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak arrived in
Washington for a weeklong visit, which includes a White House
meeting next Tuesday with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak, playing a go-between role in Arab-Israeli negotiations,
has spoken optimistically of Israel and Syria as being close to an
agreement.

<HEADLINE> Change in TV Seasons Angers NBC  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Autumn begins two weeks late this year, at least
on television, and that's made for some hard feelings among the big
broadcast networks.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen Media Research, the company that measures TV viewership,
has agreed to start the new television season this fall later than
normal because of NBC's coverage of the Summer Olympics in
September.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, which gladdened CBS, ABC and Fox and angered NBC,
means most new fall episodes of television series won't begin until
at least Oct. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Along with making viewers wait longer for the end of rerun
season, it means that Olympic telecasts won't be included in the
season ratings averages. Bragging rights, and potentially millions
of dollars in advertising revenue, are at stake in the networks'
annual ratings competition.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the networks roll out their new shows in the
second or third week of September, and have little trouble agreeing
on a starting date. This time they couldn't agree.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did what we had to do,'' Jack Loftus, Nielsen spokesman,
said Friday. ''Basically, it came down to getting everyone together
in a room several times to try to get them to agree. Finally, we
went with what the majority wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision means networks and their advertisers will have a
truer picture of who is watching, not one distorted by the expected
high viewership of the Olympics, said David Poltrack, chief
researcher at CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Yet his counterpart at NBC, Alan Wurtzel, said the TV ratings
are equally distorted when ABC runs multiple editions of ''Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire'' during a ratings ''sweeps'' month.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only reason this was done was to move the Olympics out of
the season,'' Wurtzel said. ''It would be like us saying, 'We don't
have the Super Bowl this year, so we're not going to count that
week.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Poltrack said big ratings events like the Super Bowl and the
Academy Awards are broadcast every year. It's rare when the
Olympics are held after the summer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers may have a hard time figuring when the season actually
starts this fall, because the first few weeks are likely to be
disrupted by the World Series and presidential debates.
</P>
<P>
   ABC is poised to win this season's mythical ratings
championship, almost solely due to the success of ''Who Wants to Be
a Millionaire.''

<HEADLINE> Republicans say 1998 song makes former colleague 'unelectable'  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A group of moderate House Republicans says
former colleague Mike Pappas of New Jersey is ''unelectable'' and
is circulating a videotape of him doing something he regrets --
singing ''Twinkle, twinkle Kenneth Starr'' on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   The whimsical tribute to the independent counsel became fodder
for Democrat Rush Holt, D-Pennington, who ousted Pappas in the
biggest House upset of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Now the song is being used by supporters of former Rep. Dick
Zimmer, who is battling Pappas for the Republican nomination to
challenge Holt.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a political action committee affiliated with Rep.
Fred Upton, R-Mich., circulated videotapes with footage of Pappas'
song and the television ads Holt built around the song. Copies were
delivered to members of the House leadership as well as numerous
other Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying the tape was a letter in support of Zimmer signed
by Upton and three fellow moderate Republicans -- Nancy Johnson of
Connecticut, Jim Greenwood of Pennsylvania and Michael Castle of
Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   ''His primary opponent, Mike Pappas, is unelectable,'' they
wrote. ''Pappas' singing of 'Twinkle, twinkle Kenneth Starr' on the
House floor was exploited by Democrat Rush Holt in a powerful TV ad
in the '98 race. This ad will be used again if Pappas is the
nominee.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are enclosing a tape of his singing on the House floor and
the ad used against him so you can see for yourself why Pappas
can't win.''
</P>
<P>
   Pappas is a conservative Republican; Upton's TRUST PAC supports
moderates. But Mike Waldron, a spokesman for Upton, said the
videotape was circulated not for ideological reasons, but to make
sure the party nominates a candidate who can beat Holt.
</P>
<P>
   The Pappas campaign criticized the videotape as dirty politics
and accused Zimmer of being behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the type of negative politics that really should not
be part of the Republican Party,'' said Jack Grimes, Pappas'
campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   Waldron and Zimmer campaign manager John Golub both denied that
Zimmer was involved in making the videotape.
</P>
<P>
   But Golub said, ''I think the video and the letter raise some
valid points.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer regularly says he is more ''electable'' than Pappas.
</P>
<P>
   The primary race between Pappas and Zimmer has split Republican
leaders, many of whom are friends with one or both of their former
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer supporters include House Speaker Dennis Hastert and Rep.
Tom Davis, chairman of the House GOP campaign committee. Pappas has
won endorsements from House Majority Leader Dick Armey and Majority
Whip Tom DeLay.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer served in the House from 1991 to 1997. After Zimmer
vacated the seat to run unsuccessfully for Senate, Pappas won the
seat in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   On July 21, 1998, with legal and political battles raging
between the White House and Starr, Pappas walked to the well of the
House and delivered his thoughts in song.
</P>
<P>
   ''Twinkle, twinkle Kenneth Starr, now we see how brave you
are,'' he began. The song went on to praise the independent
prosecutor as courageous and fair.
</P>
<P>
   Holt, his Democratic opponent, used footage of the song in
television and radio ads. The ads ended with the phrase, ''Mike
Pappas. Out of Tune. Out of Touch.''
</P>
<P>
   After Holt's victory, Pappas said the song was a mistake, and he
apologized.
</P>
<P>
   In February, after kicking off his campaign to regain the seat,
Pappas told supporters he meant no disrespect for the institution
of the president or Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''I bring it up because people do think about it,'' Pappas
explained last month. It's important just to tell people that I'm
aware that people think about it, recognize the effect it had at
least for many people, and to address it and move on.''

<HEADLINE> Bermuda Cargo Ship Search Continues  </HEADLINE>
By RAYMOND HAINEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMILTON, Bermuda (AP) -- Helicopters rescued 13 sailors found
clinging to life rafts or bobbing in the open water Friday and six
bodies were recovered in a dramatic search operation after a cargo
ship sank in the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian aircraft and navy ships continued to look for more
survivors from the 31-member crew of the Greek-owned Leader L,
which sank Thursday 400 miles northeast of Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   Radio transmissions from the Leader L continued until just
seconds before it went under Thursday night, suggesting some crew
may never have escaped the vessel, said Lt. Cmdr. Glenn
Chamberlain, spokesman for the Canadian Forces and Coast Guard
Rescue Coordination Center.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've ruled out the possibility of finding more lifeboats, but
we continue to hope that somebody is hanging on out there,''
Chamberlain said, speaking at the center in Halifax, Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   He said Canadian and U.S. helicopters were searching the area
''for anyone they may have missed.'' The water temperature in the
area was about 68 degrees, warm enough to allow someone to survive
until late Friday afternoon, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian Sea King helicopters fished out the 13 survivors and
ferried them to the navy destroyer Iroquois. All 13 were reported
in good condition, Chamberlain said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the survivors, at least six people were found in two
lifeboats that had been dropped by Canadian and U.S. C-130 aircraft
well before the helicopters could arrive.
</P>
<P>
   The Leader L sank hours after it placed a distress call saying
that a 45-foot steel hull plate had come loose and the hold was
flooding.
</P>
<P>
   A Canadian C-130 aircraft crew watched as the bow of the
foundering 776-foot ship dipped into the water and the vessel slid
into the sea at a 45-degree angle -- all within 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue operation began in darkness with gusty winds and
15-foot seas. Rescuers were lowered from the hovering choppers into
the ocean, placed survivors on lifts and hoisted them up.
</P>
<P>
   Owned by Leoninus Shipping of Greece, the Panama-registered
Leader L was carrying salt from Spain to New York. At least some of
its crew were Filipino and Greek, Chamberlain said.

<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- A retired Eastman Kodak Co. engineer
pleaded guilty Friday to stealing $25,900 from the photography
company to buy a dozen cameras that he sold at a discount to a
camera dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Mikloucich, 59, who retired in November after 30 years

<HEADLINE> US Air Union Reports Some Progress  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Under threat of a strike, negotiators for US
Airways and its flight attendants union worked against a midnight
deadline Friday to settle a long-standing labor dispute at the
nation's sixth largest airline.
</P>
<P>
   ''We remain hopeful,'' said Association of Flight Attendants'
president Pat Friend.
</P>
<P>
   Some minor contract issues were settled in talks overseen by the
National Mediation Board in Washington this week, but pay and
pensions remained big sticking points, Friend said at a news
conference at Reagan National Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Unless negotiators can resolve a three-year contract dispute,
the airline faced a possible 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday walkout by
flight attendants authorized by federal mediators.
</P>
<P>
   About 10,000 US Airways flight attendants are working under a
contract that expired at the end of 1996. It gave them their last
pay raise, 4 percent, at the beginning of that year.
</P>
<P>
   Off-duty US Airways attendants picketing Friday at Reagan
National said they were ready to walk off the job if they don't get
pay and retirement benefits they want.
</P>
<P>
   Michele Viar, 33, a US Airways attendant for a decade, expressed
frustration at going without a raise while company executives take
home millions. ''They make enough to give us a raise. Definitely,''
said Viar, a mother of three who lives in Fairfax, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The starting salary for US Airways attendants is $17,145 a year.
Those at the top of the pay scale earn $36,918.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways officials, who have promised to shut down operations
rather than try to weather a strike, said they were offering the
flight attendants a chance Friday to discuss alternative ways to
design a new pay and benefits formula similar to what unions for
other US Airways workers have agreed to. The company has been
trying to bring labor costs in line with its biggest competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not want to shut down this airline. We understand the
hardship that this would cause our company and our customers,''
said US Airways spokesman David Castelveter.
</P>
<P>
   AFL-CIO president John Sweeney released a statement Friday
saying the labor federation is prepared if necessary to help flight
attendants, who have only a limited strike-pay fund.
</P>
<P>
   ''The AFL-CIO and its affiliates will do whatever it takes to
assure that ... flight attendants prevail in their struggle for
simple justice,'' Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
   A last-minute agreement or extension of bargaining could avert a
disruption of US Airways flights. President Clinton also can order
a halt to transportation strikes for 60 days, and more talks, but
the White House so far has announced no plans to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, US Airways was completing shutdown preparations. An
internal memo to employees said that in the event of a flight
attendants' strike, the airline's other 35,000 workers should
report to work if scheduled Saturday and expect to be ''busy with
activities related to the shutdown,'' including helping passengers
rebook flights. It said that those who refuse to cross picket lines
would forfeit pay.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways let passengers know early this week that if it halts
operations, other major airlines and Amtrak have agreed to honor
its tickets as long as seats are available.
</P>
<P>
   A US Airways shutdown would hit hardest in the East, where the
airline controls a third of the market. Amtrak has said it has
extra passenger coaches standing by for major routes linking
Boston, New York, Washington and points to the southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Many nervous travel agents stopped booking US Airways flights,
but some hopeful weekend travelers were taking their chances.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Wetherall, 27, visiting the United States from South
Africa with a friend, was in the US Airways line at Washington's
airport on Friday to pick up tickets for a Saturday flight to
Orlando, Fla., despite the labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope they're going to be paying for our accommodations here
if they don't sort it out,'' Wetherall only half-joked.
</P>
<P>
   The only US Airways flights that would not be affected are
regional commuter airlines that operate under a service agreement
with the airline, using the name US Airways Express. They would
continue to fly.
</P>
<P>
   In trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, US Airways
fell 4.5 percent, or by $1.06\, to $22.37{ a share.

<HEADLINE> Treasury Reassures on Fannie Mae  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Treasury Department's suggestion that its
ties be cut to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac roiled the bond market
this week, but a top official said Friday that the comment doesn't
represent a change in the Clinton administration's policy.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds issued by these two government-sponsored mortgage lenders
came under pressure Wednesday and Thursday after Gary Gensler, the
Treasury's Department under secretary for domestic finance, told a
House panel Wednesday that Congress should eliminate a never-used
$2.25 billion line of credit at Treasury that Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac may tap in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Gensler, seeking to allay fears on Wall Street, said
that his testimony Wednesday was ''consistent with long-standing
administration principles in this area'' and with remarks by
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''It does not represent a change in the government's
relationship with the GSEs,'' Gensler said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the government doesn't guarantee Fannie Mae's and
Freddie Mac's debt, investors view the line of credit as providing
these so-called ''government-sponsored enterprises'' with implicit
backing of the U.S. government. The possibility of having this and
other ties severed spooked some investors this week and they moved
money out of agency bonds and into the safety of Treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.4 trillion in debt held by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and
the Federal Home Loan Bank System is now roughly the size of the
entire municipal bond market, Gensler said in testimony before the
House Banking Committee's capital markets subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's chairman, Rep. Richard Baker, R-La., is author of a
bill that would overhaul how the agencies are regulated.
</P>
<P>
   Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are stockholder owned but were
created by Congress to buy home loans from lenders to supply ready
cash to the mortgage market.
</P>
<P>
   ''As I emphasized in my testimony, given the importance of these
institutions to the housing market and the government's
long-standing relationship with them, it is appropriate for
Congress to review the relevant issues from time to time,'' Gensler
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fannie Mae welcomed Gensler's comments Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are pleased with and welcome Treasury's affirmation that
there has been no change into its policies regarding Fannie Mae or
in the relationship between the U.S. government and Fannie Mae,''
said executive vice president and chief financial officer Timothy
Howard. ''This should be reassuring to market participants...''
</P>
<P>
   Gensler also suggested in his testimony that Congress consider
repealing provisions that let banks hold an unlimited amount of
debt from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear whether any of Gensler's recommendations will go
anywhere given that lawmakers in Congress are at odds over whether
and what legislative changes are needed.

<HEADLINE> CompUSA Chief Executive Steps Down  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- CompUSA Inc. chief executive James F. Halpin
stepped down Friday, nearly five months after saying he should be
fired if a company restructuring didn't improve financial results.
</P>
<P>
   Halpin, 48, was replaced by Harold F. Compton, 52, who had been
chief operating officer, said the company, the nation's largest
computer store chain.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas-based CompUSA, which operates 218 U.S. stores, also said
it was realigning several senior management positions to focus on
service to customers and vendors.
</P>
<P>
   The shakeup came just weeks after Mexican retail holding company
Grupo Sanborns SA completed its roughly $800 million tender-offer
purchase of the company. Sanborns plans to keep a 51 percent
controlling interest and sell a 49 percent stake to Telefonos de
Mexico SA, Microsoft Corp. and SBC Communications Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the company closed its online retailer,
cozone.com, which it launched in October. The company had reported
disappointing sales at the site and decided to shift its functions
to compusa.com, which it believes will benefit from the more
familiar name, spokeswoman Suzanne Shelton said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Halpin joined CompUSA in 1993 during a period of rapid growth
and changes. The former president of HomeBase, Halpin made staff
cuts and centralized buying to improve the company's results and
oversaw the 1998 purchase of the Computer City chain from Tandy
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The chain has struggled in the past two years -- its shares
slumped from $30 to under $6 in 18 months -- as the company was hit
by competition from direct sellers of personal computers and by
falling PC prices. Last year the company closed several stores,
invested heavily in the now-failed Internet business and shifted
its focus from PCs to other kinds of electronics gadgets that it
hopes will generate higher margins.
</P>
<P>
   At a shareholders' meeting In early November, Halpin was
barraged with questions from anxious investors. As a major
stockholder himself, Halpin vowed to improve the company's
performance.
</P>
<P>
   The company lost $53 million in the fiscal year that ended in
June 1999 and had narrowed its losses to $2 million on sales of
$1.38 billion in the last three months of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Gore Worker Accused of Intimidation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A police officer has accused an Al Gore
campaign worker charged with drunken driving of invoking her
political connections to intimidate him.
</P>
<P>
   Anupama Rangappa, 25, a scheduler at the Gore presidential
campaign headquarters, has an April 6 court date. The arrest
warrant says she was driving 85 mph in a 40 mph zone on March 11.
Police spokesman Don Aaron said she was not given a speeding ticket
because of ''officer discretion.''
</P>
<P>
   In an arrest report, police officer Joseph Simonik said he
thought Rangappa was trying to intimidate him, according to Aaron.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am on the Gore 2000 campaign, and I'm going to call the
United States district attorney right now,'' Rangappa was quoted as
saying, according to the arrest report.
</P>
<P>
   She failed a field sobriety test and refused to take a
blood-alcohol test, the officer said.
</P>
<P>
   Rangappa is still on the staff, said Kathleen Begala,
communications director for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The woman's attorney, Tommy Overton, said Rangappa was traveling
and she had not discussed the police allegations with her.

<HEADLINE> Oops, wrong house: Judge's vacation home razed in City Hall snafu  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- A Pennsylvania judge is suing the
city for mistakenly demolishing a house she bought to use as a
vacation retreat.
</P>
<P>
   City Hall says it was an honest mistake. Fine, says Philadelphia
Municipal Court Judge Thomasine Tynes. Now replace it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not a hard person to get along with. They need to 'fess up
and build me a new house, or find one of equal value,'' she said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The saga began in 1998, when Tynes, 56, bought the decrepit
two-story at 110 North Congress Avenue for $20,800. She
acknowledges it was no oceanfront mansion, but it had potential.
She spent more than $4,000 on a new roof and planned other repairs
to the three-bedroom, 2{-bathroom structure.
</P>
<P>
   Last Aug. 23, she got a call from a friend who lives down the
street. The woman was hysterical, telling Tynes demolition crews
were knocking the house down. Tynes didn't believe her, so the
woman held up her cordless telephone receiver so she could hear it
for herself.
</P>
<P>
   That night, she trekked to the shore to see for herself. Sure
enough, the house had been reduced to rubble.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was terrible. I was so upset,'' Tynes said. She didn't feel
any better when she called city demolition officials. ''Someone
said they did me a favor (in razing the house). What arrogance,''
Tynes said.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said the house was infested with vermin, had a
collapsed porch roof, rusted metal joints and was a prime candidate
for demolition. The city notified the previous owner that a hearing
had been scheduled at which the demolition order could be
challenged, according to City Solicitor Mary Siracusa.
</P>
<P>
   But the previous owner apparently didn't tell Tynes and the
demolition notice lagged behind when she bought the property
several weeks later, Siracusa said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You send out the (demolition) notice and you publish the
notice, which we did. During that period of time, that's when it
was transferred. We sent all the notices to the correct owner. But
by the time someone closes and the time the deeds get recorded,
there can be a several-month delay,'' Siracusa said.
</P>
<P>
   So the city's demolition order was carried out, on Aug. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Tynes' lawyer, Thomas John Forkin, said he negotiated with city
officials for months in hopes of reaching a settlement to replace
the house. Unable to settle, he filed suit Wednesday seeking
$101,000 for the home and $100,000 in punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Siracusa says the city isn't at fault. In any event, Siracusa
says, the city should not be held liable for punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unfortunate. It's not our intent to recklessly demolish
people's homes. If we can come to an amicable resolution, we
certainly will. But there's no basis for punitive damages. Nothing
was intentional,'' Siracusa said.
</P>
<P>
   Tynes, a 10-year veteran of the bench who has heard her share of
excuses, says she's not out to be vindictive.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not a materialistic kind of person. But it bothers me that
nobody checked their records. If I put the wrong person in jail,
I'd lose my job. Just pay me for my house.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the house at 110 North Congress was just cursed. When news
of the mistaken demolition got out, Tynes received a call from the
U.S. Coast Guard station here.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out it had been the home of William Garton, 22, a Coast
Guardsman who died in a 1932 storm that claimed the lives of four
other Guardsmen. Of the five, his was the only body recovered.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, Garton's name appears on a bronze memorial at the
Coast Guard station, says station Lt. Rich Condit, the station
commander.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just an odd coincidence,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> NASA Decides Observatory Fate  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER, AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An ailing space observatory, already past its
expected lifetime, will be crashed deliberately into a remote area
of the Pacific Ocean to avoid a risk that the 17-ton spacecraft
might smash into a populated area, NASA said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A series of rocket firings starting in May will lower the orbit
of the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory, and a final rocket thrust
will send the craft into its fiery plunge on June 3. The crash is
expected to scatter debris along a corridor of ocean 2,547 miles
long and 16 miles wide.
</P>
<P>
   The impact lane starts about 2,500 miles southeast of Hawaii,
crosses the equator in a northwest to southeast angle and ends
about 680 miles south of the Galapagos Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Compton's return to Earth will occur in darkness and is not
expected to be observed, although military radar may follow the
craft for part of its long fall. The Compton will be the largest
spacecraft every brought down in a deliberate, controlled crash.
</P>
<P>
   The $670 million Compton was launched April 5, 1991, with an
expected mission life of five years. It carries four instruments
that can detect natural gamma rays, a powerful form of invisible
light that bathes the universe. In nine years of operation, the
craft detected more than 400 gamma ray sources and more than 2,500
gamma ray bursts, a powerful type of celestial explosion that still
puzzles scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists still use the spacecraft, but Ed Weiler, NASA's chief
scientist, decided it was too risky to keep the heavyweight craft
in orbit.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a difficult decision, but the safest option is to
bring it down in June,'' said Ed Weiler, NASA's chief scientist.
</P>
<P>
   If NASA did nothing and let the craft eventually fall from
natural forces, he said, there was one chance in 1,000 for a human
fatality on Earth. The Compton's 317-mile orbit carries it craft
over some of the most populated areas of the world, including
Mexico City, Bangkok and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   A controlled crash, with remaining onboard guidance and control
equipment working, would lower the risk of a fatality to about one
in 29 million. Even with the loss of the primary control system, he
said, a controlled crash using a back-up system would keep the risk
at about one in 4.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Weiler, who made the end-of-mission decision, said some
potential astronomy research will be lost due to the controlled
crash, but he felt safety was more important.
</P>
<P>
   ''How much science is worth the risk of even one human life?''
he asked at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Weiler said NASA engineers began planning a controlled crash for
Compton in February 1999, when one of the craft's three gyroscopes
began ailing. When the gyro failed altogether last year, engineers
starting making specific end-of-mission plans.
</P>
<P>
   The spacecraft uses gyroscopes to control its position in space.
It is capable of operating with just the two gyros, but one more
failure and the craft would be more difficult to control.
</P>
<P>
   By planning the spacecraft suicide while the gyros are still
working, engineers can more precisely target the impact zone.
</P>
<P>
   Weiler said other options were considered, including sending
astronauts to the spacecraft to attempt repairs. But none was
considered worth the risk, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If NASA did nothing, the Compton could remain in orbit for about
11 more years. As it ages, however, the chances increase that
equipment will fail and engineers would lose the ability to control
its re-entry. This happened with the Skylab, a 78-ton abandoned
U.S. space station that crashed in 1979. Debris fell harmlessly
into the Indian Ocean and across a remote section of western
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers expect the Compton to break up as it smashes into the
upper atmosphere from space. The heat of friction will vaporize
many parts, turning most into pea-size grains. But Weiler said some
metal chunks of up to a ton in weight could hit the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Among such parts are six 1,800-pound aluminum I-beams that make
up the spacecraft's spine.
</P>
<P>
   The end-of-mission plan calls for all science studies to stop on
May 26. Rocket firings on May 31 and June 1 will lower the orbit
from 317 miles to 156 miles. On June 3, a third rocket thrust will
drop the craft to a 93-mile orbit, and a final rocket firing 90
minutes later will send Compton into a long, fiery fall toward the
Pacific Ocean.

<HEADLINE> Fed Makes New 'Payday Loans' Rule  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve on Friday published a rule
making it clear that businesses offering so-called ''payday loans''
must disclose to customers in writing the annual interest rate on
the loans.
</P>
<P>
   Payday loans, the short-term, high-interest cash advances
against borrowers' paychecks --often provided by storefront lenders
-- can carry triple-digit interest rates on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve's rule clarifies that payday loans are
subject to the terms of the Truth in Lending Act. That means
lenders must disclose in writing, before the transaction is
completed, the finance charge for the loan and its annual
percentage rate.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank's staff attorneys previously considered payday
loans to fall under the Truth in Lending Act, but the new rule
makes that interpretation official. The rule took effect on Friday
but compliance with it is voluntary until Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Payday loans recently have come under criticism by consumer
groups and some lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a senior Democratic lawmaker proposed
legislation aimed at restraining the business. Rep. John LaFalce of
New York, senior Democrat on the House Banking Committee, cited a
recent survey by consumer groups showing that borrowers are paying
interest of 400 percent or more on an annual basis for payday
loans.
</P>
<P>
   His bill would prohibit all federally insured banks from making
payday loans either directly or through an affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the industry maintain that some payday loan companies
skirt the law in the 19 states that ban the loans by teaming up
with out-of-state nationally chartered banks.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the payday loan industry have acknowledged that
there are problems, including cases of excessive use of
''rollovers,'' in which consumers are unable to repay the loans and
they are extended for two more weeks or so. However, they say, no
new federal regulation is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our product fills a tremendous market need and is
enthusiastically embraced by millions of working Americans,'' Billy
Webster, president of the company Advance America and head of the
Community Financial Services Association, said recently.
</P>
<P>
   The industry earned an estimated $1.4 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Payday loans work this way: You need money today, but payday is
a week or two away. You write a check dated for your payday and
give it to the lender. You get your money, minus the interest fee.
In two weeks, the lender cashes your check or charges you more
interest to extend, or ''roll over,'' the loan for another two
weeks, possibly at a higher interest rate.
</P>
<P>
   The typical fee for a $100 cash advance is $15. Industry
officials say that is reasonable compared with the fees banks
charge for bouncing a check, which average $22.
</P>
<P>
   The 19 states and two U.S. jurisdictions that ban payday loans
are Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Connecticut, Georgia, Maine,
Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New
York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Vermont,
Virginia, West Virginia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

<HEADLINE> Pope High Doesn't End For Pilgrims  </HEADLINE>
By DINA KRAFT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KORAZIM, Israel (AP) -- It was a high that didn't end even after
Pope John Paul II was gone: Tens of thousands of young pilgrims who
had heard the pope's call to faith carried his message singing,
dancing and laughing into the windswept Galilee night.
</P>
<P>
   On the Mount of the Beatitudes, where Jesus delivered his most
beloved sermon, John Paul made his plea to 100,000 muddy, raptly
attentive pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
   The pope had called especially on the young to come and then
carry his message into the next generation. And they flocked in
from all over the globe: Africa, Europe, the Far East, the
Americas. Flags of the world dotted the green hill that tumbles to
the Sea of Galilee.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a great moment,'' said Claudine Wagner, a 38-year-old
doctor from Metz, France. ''I have something in common with all
Christians around the world -- this is the power of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The cheer withstood heavy rains overnight and ankle-deep mud.
Armed with guitars, some of the visitors sang relentlessly.
Concentric circles of joyous faithful expanded with each song.
</P>
<P>
   ''Come join us, dance!'' teen-age girls beckoned to passers-by.
''John Paul II, we love you!'' they chanted.
</P>
<P>
   There was silence, though, as John Paul told the audience that
Jesus can transform their weaknesses into the strength to be good
Christians in today's world.
</P>
<P>
   Some got the message loud and clear. Elena Ridas, 18, a
ponytailed high-school student from Los Angeles, said she hoped the
sermon would keep her clear of her troubled past and the temptation
of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is old, but he has been around for many years and is
wise,'' Ridas said. ''I hope that by coming here, my life will
change, that he will help me realize that life in the way I have
been living it does not follow God's path.''
</P>
<P>
   Israelis watched, bemused, as the throng continued -- singing,
dancing, some with crosses painted on their faces -- after the pope
helicoptered off into the night.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was wonderful!'' said Susan Rohana, a Christian Arab
Israeli who longs for religious peace in this tough neighborhood
and hopes the pope's pilgrimage was its harbinger. ''It's important
to us,'' she said, ''because we really want to live together.''

<HEADLINE> 'Twinkle Twinkle' Haunts House GOP  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A group of moderate House Republicans say
former colleague Mike Pappas is ''unelectable'' and are circulating
a videotape of him doing something he regrets -- singing ''Twinkle,
twinkle Kenneth Starr'' on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   The whimsical tribute to the independent counsel became fodder
for Rep. Rush Holt, D-N.J., who ousted Pappas in the biggest House
upset of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Now the song is being used by supporters of former Rep. Dick
Zimmer, who is battling Pappas for the Republican nomination to
challenge Holt.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a political action committee affiliated with Rep.
Fred Upton, R-Mich., circulated videotapes with footage of Pappas'
song and the television ads Holt built around the song. Copies were
delivered to GOP leaders in the House and numerous other
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying the tape was a letter supporting Zimmer signed by
Upton and three fellow moderate Republicans -- Nancy Johnson of
Connecticut, Jim Greenwood of Pennsylvania and Michael Castle of
Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   ''... Mike Pappas is unelectable,'' they wrote. ''Pappas'
singing of 'Twinkle, twinkle Kenneth Starr' on the House floor was
exploited by Democrat Rush Holt in a powerful TV ad in the '98
race. This ad will be used again if Pappas is the nominee. We are
enclosing a tape of his singing on the House floor and the ad used
against him so you can see for yourself why Pappas can't win.''
</P>
<P>
   Pappas is a conservative Republican; Upton's TRUST PAC supports
moderates. But Mike Waldron, a spokesman for Upton, said the
videotape was circulated not for ideological reasons, but to make
sure the party nominates a candidate who can beat Holt.
</P>
<P>
   The Pappas campaign criticized the videotape as dirty politics
and accused Zimmer of being behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the type of negative politics that really should not
be part of the Republican Party,'' said Jack Grimes, Pappas'
campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   Waldron and Zimmer campaign manager John Golub both denied that
Zimmer was involved in making the videotape.

<HEADLINE> Bush Says Education Is Main Thrust  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- George W. Bush embraced traditional
Democratic images in President Clinton's back yard Friday, seeking
minority support with a speech at the Arkansas site of one of the
major school integration battles of the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presidential contender said the ''great challenge
of our own'' is to ensure educational excellence for all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was challenged by the Central High School principal and
others about his views of a limited federal role. But even with
that reception, the visit provided new words and pictures to
compete with the image of Bush's appearance at South Carolina's Bob
Jones University that has dominated coverage of his racial views
for months.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor and putative Republican presidential nominee
said that four decades after a racial standoff at the school was
resolved by Army intervention, ''access is universal, but
excellence is not. All can enter our schools but unfortunately not
all are learning.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a tremendous gap of achievement between rich and
poor, between white and minority, and whatever the cause, the
effect is discrimination,'' Bush told a panel gathered in the
school's library.
</P>
<P>
   The school is the closest to the Arkansas Capitol and governor's
mansion, where Clinton lived before becoming president. Clinton
returned to the campus in September 1997 to mark the 40th
anniversary of the desegregation crisis -- and to warn that some of
the nation's schools were resegregating.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was accompanied Friday by Arkansas' current governor,
Republican Mike Huckabee.
</P>
<P>
   Bush argues that lagging schools are particularly harmful to
minorities and the poor, and he proposes improving education by
instituting accountability through nationally mandated but locally
administered tests.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he has proposed taking federal Title I money away
from schools that perform poorly for three or more years, so
parents can get vouchers to use at other schools.
</P>
<P>
   Philosophically, Bush says that states, not the federal
government, should be responsible for both ''bricks and mortar''
and teacher salaries. He argues the federal government can provide
support by passing money and authority back to the states.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of his 10-person panel questioned that approach.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Rousseau, principal of Pulaski Middle School, said: ''We
have to, nationwide, make our teacher salaries competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph Howard, Central High's principal, argued the federal
government needs to provide infrastructure support. ''We've taken a
pounding. Now we need a lift up. We need your help,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Derrick Williams, president of Central High's student
council, had a lively exchange with Bush over the use of vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Public schools start behind when they enter this race,''
Williams said, arguing they can't compete with private schools when
it comes to technology and teacher salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said: ''I don't know whether or not the voucher system is
the panacea that people say it is, but I'm willing to give it a
shot in my state of Texas to determine whether or not it makes
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore also headed back to school Friday,
visiting L'Anse Creuse Middle School North in Macomb, Mich. Gore,
Bush's Democratic presidential opponent, taught a class, talked
with teachers, students and bus drivers and also lined up for
cafeteria pizza.
</P>
<P>
   ''I learned in my work setting up the reinventing government
program that the most important insights and lessons by far come
from the people who are actually doing the hands-on work,'' the
vice president said.
</P>
<P>
   The school that Bush visited, Central High, was the scene of a
confrontation in September 1957, when Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus
ordered the National Guard to prevent nine black students from
entering the building under a desegregation plan.
</P>
<P>
   President Eisenhower responded by federalizing the Guard and
sending in an Army detachment to clear a path.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has improved his standing among blacks and minorities in
Texas during his two terms, but among black voters nationally he
has trailed Gore by lopsided margins in recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   He provoked questions about his racial sensitivity during the
primary season when he spoke at Bob Jones University, a South
Carolina school that banned interracial dating. Several weeks
later, the university lifted its ban.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Bush denied he was seeking an antidote to Bob Jones.
Still, the occasion provided fodder for criticism from the Gore
camp.
</P>
<P>
   ''George W. Bush is using the symbolism of Central High as a
political fig leaf to hide the fact that he doesn't have an
education agenda, to cover up the fact that minorities have fared
poorly in Texas schools under his leadership and to obscure the
fact that George W. Bush embraced Bob Jones University earlier this
year,'' said Gore spokesman Chris Lehane.
</P>
<P>
   Besides visiting Central High, Bush came to Clinton's home turf
to raise money. He held a fund-raiser at a Little Rock hotel that
was expected to gross about $350,000, on top of an estimated
$750,000 he raised Thursday night in West Palm Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had his own in-your-face fund-raiser on Friday, traveling
to Houston in Bush's home state.

   Microsoft Offers Antitrust Proposal
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. faxed a detailed proposal to
government lawyers today to settle its landmark antitrust case
after the trial judge warned he will deliver his verdict Tuesday
absent progress in secret settlement talks in Chicago, people close
to the case said. It was unclear what was contained within the
proposal, described as technically complicated, that government
lawyers were carefully reviewing. Other sources close to the
antitrust case have indicated government lawyers are backing away
from proposals to break up Microsoft in order to restrain what the
judge has characterized as the company's abuse of its monopoly
power over the technology industry.

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Under threat of a strike, negotiators for US
Airways and its flight attendants union worked against a midnight
deadline today to settle a long-standing labor dispute at the
nation's sixth largest airline. Some minor contract issues were
settled in talks overseen by the National Mediation Board in
Washington this week, but pay and pensions remained big sticking
points, Association of Flight Attendants' president Pat Friend said
at a news conference. Unless negotiators can resolve a three-year
contract dispute, the airline faced a possible 12:01 a.m. EST
Saturday walkout by flight attendants authorized by federal
mediators. US Airways officials have promised to shut down
operations rather than try to weather a strike.

   Richardson Expects OPEC Oil Boost

   LONDON (AP) -- OPEC members are likely to agree to raise crude
oil production at next week's meeting, U.S. Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson said today. Richardson's comments followed a round of
talks with members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries, including Algeria, Nigeria, Indonesia and the United
Arab Emirates. OPEC members meet Monday at Vienna, Austria.
Richardson said that seven of the 11 members of the cartel
recognize a need for an oil increase. He did not name the holdouts,
but Libya, Iran and Algeria have expressed opposition to increasing
oil output. Iraq, too, has objected to Western demands for
production rises.

   Stocks End Narrowly Mixed
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks ended a dramatic week in mundane fashion
today, closing narrowly mixed. Johnson &AMP; Johnson pulled the Dow
Jones industrials lower after removing a popular drug from the
market. The Dow fell 7.14 to 11,112.72, having retreated from a
115-point gain this morning. The Nasdaq composite index rose 22.72
to 4,963.33. On the NYSE, declining issues led advancers
1,510-1,445.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Financial figures as of Friday's close:
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Shares of Johnson &AMP; Johnson tumbled nearly 10
percent today as investors reacted warily to the health care
conglomerate's decision late yesterday to stop marketing the
heartburn drug Propulsid. Propulsid has been linked to 80 deaths
since 1993 and a variety of serious cardiac problems in hundreds of
patients. Johnson &AMP; Johnson shares were down 8} at 71\ on the New
York Stock Exchange. The company will no longer distribute the drug
to pharmacies after July and will only make it available to a
limited number of patients who fail other therapies. The
''limited-access'' program will begin May 1.

person familiar with the situation said a final agreement is not
imminent. While neither company has publicly confirmed
negotiations, the source, who requested anonymity, said
DaimlerChrysler is bargaining for a 33 percent stake in Mitsubishi.
A German newspaper reported in its Saturday editions that a deal

month to be acquired by British telecommunications giant Vodafone
AirTouch PLC. ThyssenKrupp said today it would like to reach a
wide-ranging pact that includes all activities of Mannesman's Atecs
unit. Mannesmann had planned to spin off Atecs as a separate
company sometime this summer, possibly in June. The Financial Times

finally is beginning to slow. It was biggest drop in 10 months for
durable goods, the second month in a row that orders fell to U.S.
factories for items expected to last at least three years, the

<HEADLINE> Judge Nixes Publix Class Action Suit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A federal judge has refused class action
status in a sex discrimination case brought against Publix Super
Markets Inc. on behalf of thousands of female workers.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 women who sued Publix in 1997 did not prove they had
sufficient ''commonality,'' or similar circumstances, and so must
proceed with cases individually, U.S. District Judge Henry Adams
ruled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The women were trying to represent all female employees who work
or formerly worked at three Publix manufacturing plants and eight
warehouses and distribution centers in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs claimed the Lakeland-based chain discriminated in
hiring and promotion practices since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're delighted,'' said Jennifer Bush, spokeswoman for Publix.
''Publix remains committed to fair employment and advancement of
all our associates.''
</P>
<P>
   The company, the nation's 10th largest grocer, operates more
than 620 stores in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the women said they plan to amend the case, naming
new plaintiffs to satisfy criteria set out by the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Stokes, a Minneapolis lawyer representing the women, said
the workers will file individual discrimination cases since Adams
denied them the chance to be heard as a group.

gain in early trading. The Dow, which rose 253 points Thursday,
ended the week with a gain of 517.49, or 4.9 percent. The blue-chip

</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson fell 7{ to 72{ -- or the equivalent of more

Wit, whose business lines include investment banking and
extended-hours trading, said it expects to report its first
profitable quarter since going public in June.
</P>
<P>
   A robust outlook for corporate profits should help most stocks
advance in the coming weeks, said Alan Ackerman, senior vice
president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''The magnet for money right now is improving corporate
earnings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the week, the prospect of strong earnings for a wide
variety of companies helped energize the stock market, said Thomas
McManus, equity portfolio strategist at Banc of America Securities
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''Positive earnings news from General Electric, Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter and Goldman Sachs helped investors sustain their recent
trend of recognizing value among sectors other than technology,''
he said.

<P>
   Before trading began, the government reported orders to U.S.
factories for big-ticket equipment and machinery fell 2.3 percent
in February, the largest decline in 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger-than-expected drop, which followed a 2.2 percent
decline in January, could help ease some concerns that the Federal
Reserve will keep fighting inflationary pressures by slowing the
economy with higher interest rates. The central bank raised its
short-term lending rates again on Tuesday, the fifth increase since
last summer, and many analysts expect the Fed will boost rates
again.
</P>

   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on
both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq.

   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.3 percent.
Germany's Xetra DAX index rose 3.0 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100

<HEADLINE> Feds Investigate Cadillac Air Bags  </HEADLINE>
By NEDRA PICKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal safety agency is investigating some
Cadillac DeVilles after 32 people reported being hurt when
side-impact air bags deployed without a collision.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reported
Friday that 253 complaints have been lodged about failures in the
air bags' sensor systems that made the bags inadvertently open.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints have involved model years 1997 through 1999. About
303,347 of the cars are on the road. When air bags deploy
unexpectedly and without cause, the agency said, people in the car
can be injured, and drivers can lose control.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation was opened Sept. 27 and upgraded Feb. 15.
Terry Rhadigan, spokesman for General Motors Corp., said the
automaker is cooperating with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The NHTSA also is investigating power bench seats in some
conversion vans after receiving reports that two children died and
one was injured by being trapped under the seats.
</P>
<P>
   According to the investigation report, switches in the vans can
recline the bench seat into a bed for sleeping even when the car
isn't running. That means that the seat in a parked car can be
reclined by child when no adult is present.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation, opened Feb. 23, involves 1996 model
conversion vans made by Starcraft Automotive Group Inc. of Goshen,
Ind., the 1992 Cobra minivan from Centurion Vehicles of White
Pigeon, Mich., and 1998 models from Jayco Inc. of Middlebury, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at none of the three conversion van companies would
comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   NHTSA opens any safety investigation with a preliminary inquiry
in which the government and manufacturer exchange paperwork
including any complaints. That is the status of the conversion vans
cases.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation then could be upgraded to an engineering
analysis, during which engineers study parts to see if they are
defective. That is the status of the DeVille case. An investigation
eventually can lead to a recall, but many are dropped.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Lurch Higher  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Crude oil prices scooted higher Friday on a last
burst of
speculation that OPEC won't decide to open its spigots wide enough
to satisfy rising world demand when it meets on Monday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Other energy products also rose.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, wheat and palladium futures sank.
</P>
<P>
   Crude shot higher even as some officials of the Organization of
the Petroleum Exporting Countries were gathering in Vienna,
Austria, for a much-awaited decision on production quotas.
</P>
<P>
   The current output-slashing agreement, which expires March 31,
has succeeded in driving down world supplies and caused prices to
triple before falling sharply in the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   West Texas Intermediate crude for May delivery rose 71 cents to
$28.02 a barrel. That leaves the spot contract down 18 percent from
its March 8 peak of $34.37 but still up 9 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from Washington, key producers Saudi Arabia and
Venezuela have privately pledged a significant production increase.
But they are still trying to persuade OPEC holdouts such as Iran,
which wants to limit the hike to 500,000 barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   The last-minute resistance makes investors edgy.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say an additional 2 million barrels to 2.5 million
barrels daily are needed to replenish depleted inventories and
satisfy growing demand. Some of that amount is likely to be allowed
to seep onto the market unofficially, but a half-million-barrel
increase like the one backed by Iran would without question drain
stockpiles further.
</P>
<P>
   ''That would in effect be giving us extra production with an
eyedropper,'' said Tim Evans, senior energy analyst for Pegasus
Econometrics in New York. ''We need much more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   A general rally in petroleum products also was fueled by news of
refinery troubles, most notably a major fire at Shell's Godorf
facility near Cologne, Germany. The 170,000-barrel-a-day refinery
is expected to remain at 50 percent production for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Refineries in Port Arthur, Texas, and near Houston suffered less
serious disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   April heating oil rose 3.66 cents to 74.87 cents a gallon, April
unleaded gasoline rose 2.98 cents to 94.89 cents a gallon and April
natural gas fell 1.1 cent to $2.836 per 1,000 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
   In London, May Brent crude from the North Sea rose 43 cents to
$25.91 on the International Petroleum Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat futures sank to a three-month low on the Chicago Board of
Trade on forecasts for further rain in the winter wheat belt,
already socked by substantial precipitation.
</P>
<P>
   The same storm system now is forecast to dump less rain than
previously thought on the eastern Midwest this weekend, however,
resulting in a rally in soybeans and corn Friday.
</P>
<P>
   May wheat fell 3{ cents to $2.52} a bushel while May soybeans
rose 8} cents to $5.30} a bushel and May corn rose 1} cent to $2.32
a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Palladium fell to a five-week low on the New York Merc as
expectations rose that Russia, the No. 1 world supplier, is about
to dump significant amounts of the metal onto the market after a
long absence. Palladium is in heavy demand by the automotive
industry for use in catalytic converters.
</P>
<P>
   June palladium settled down $24 at $618 an ounce after dipping
to $615.10.

<HEADLINE> United Air Pilots Talks Stalled  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE CARPENTER, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Contract negotiations between United Airlines and
its pilots union are deadlocked and appear likely to head into
mediation shortly after the current pact expires April 12, a union
spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Herb Hunter, spokesman for the United Airlines unit of the
Air Line Pilots Association, said the pilots ''haven't seen
anything thus far to indicate that (a settlement) will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sides appear on track to take the standoff to the
National Mediation Board next month, he said.
</P>
<P>
   United spokeswoman Wendy Parson said only that negotiations are
ongoing, citing the carrier's policy to not discuss such talks.
</P>
<P>
   Talks involving the world's biggest airline, based in Elk Grove
Village, Ill., and its pilots are taking place at a time when
friction is high between carriers and their employees. US Airways
was in tense negotiations Friday to try to avert a threatened
walkout by flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
   But many had anticipated smoother negotiations at United after
the adoption of a 1994 employee stock ownership plan that has
provided labor stability while giving United workers majority
ownership of the carrier's parent, UAL Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of us had hoped that we'd be farther along,'' said
Hunter, a United pilot for 21 years. ''We'd hoped that the ESOP
mentality would have changed more than it has.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock ownership plan starts expiring next month and the
negotiations will determine whether it is renewed.
</P>
<P>
   United also faces the expiration of a contract with its
machinists July 12.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the airline said it expected that negotiated
raises with the pilots and mechanics would carve into 2000 profits.
</P>
<P>
   United pay rates have slipped below those of competitors since
1994, when employees agreed to steep pay cuts in exchange for
stock, and many union members are determined to close the gap.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Slips  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar slipped against European currencies
Friday, losing ground against the euro, Swiss franc as well as the
British pound.
</P>
<P>
   In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at 97.53 cents, up
from 97.19 cents late Thursday, and the British pound rose to
$1.5926 from $1.5863. The dollar fell to 1.6277 Swiss francs from
1.6465.
</P>
<P>
   An interest rate increase in Switzerland was a main factor
behind the rally in European currencies. The Swiss National Bank
raised its main interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage
point, more than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation that England may also raise interest rates soon to
cool off its economy also helped lift the pound.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar also edged lower against the Japanese yen, trading at
107.05 yen in late trading, down from 107.32 yen. The dollar was
also quoted at 1.4636 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4697.
</P>
<P>
   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate.
Based on Friday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 2.0053 German
marks, down from 2.0121; 6.7254 French francs, down from 6.7496;
and 1,985.21 Italian lire, down from 1,991.95.

<HEADLINE> 13 Dead After SAfrica Disco Stampede  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) -- A dance hall crowded with
celebrating students erupted into chaos Friday when someone threw a
tear gas canister into the room, killing 13 youths and injuring 44.
</P>
<P>
   Some 600 students were at an afternoon party at the Throb
Nightclub in suburban Durbin when tear gas suddenly filled the
room, causing students to rush out in panic, said fire department
spokesman Jay Kanniappen.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have not released details on how the 13 died.
KwaZulu-Natal police spokesman Bala Naidoo said a brick wall
collapsed during the chaos. Police suspect that one of the children
was responsible for releasing the tear gas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Govender, 19, is a regular at the club and was there
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''About three to four songs had been played when suddenly people
started screaming, pushing and running towards the doorway. I
didn't know what was happening, but found that I couldn't
breathe,'' he said. ''I was forced to join the scramble to get out
of the club as fast as I could.''
</P>
<P>
   He fell and was trampled upon, but managed to get up and escaped
uninjured. His clothes were torn, and he lost a shoe.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson Marimuthu, 18, said he fears a friend died in the
chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had just reached the safety of the exit and as I turned to
look back, I saw this wall hurtling downwards on the people
below,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The injured suffered mainly abrasions, respiratory problems and
head injuries. Several were seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   RK Khan hospital superintendent Dr. Prakash Subban the injured
ranged in age from 12 to 18.
</P>
<P>
   The club had two exits, but the young people had access to only
one, said Narend Singh, provincial minister for agriculture and
environmental affairs.
</P>
<P>
   However, the club's owner, Rajan Naidoo, said the club had four
exits, and that all were open.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the children panicked and headed for the main entrance
where they initially came in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Naidoo said he offered to help pay for the funerals of the
victims. The youngest person to die was 11, and Singh called for an
investigation into why children as young as that were at the club.
</P>
<P>
   Naidoo said it was matinee disco, and that the general policy
was to serve alcohol only to those 18 and older.
</P>
<P>
   Community volunteers set up an emergency center with trauma
counselors to help parents. By Friday evening, 300 people had lined
up at a police station to find out whether their children were
among the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the club, a man with a megaphone urged a crowd of about
100 angry people to burn down the club and the owner's car. Police
were at the scene, and the South African National Defense Force had
been called in for assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The club is located in Chatsworth, a Durban suburb with a
largely Indian population of 600,000. Durban, South Africa's
third-largest city, lies on the Indian Ocean coast, 348 miles
southeast of Johannesburg.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique To Claim Flood Baby  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- Mozambique's government will take care
of Rositha Pedro, the baby who drew world sympathy when she was
born in a tree where her mother took refuge from the country's
devastating floods, a newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   President Joachim Chissano announced that the state would take
the responsibility to ensure that Rositha was educated and
supported, the country's main newspaper Noticias reported.
</P>
<P>
   Chissano said the baby and her mother, Sophia, had become the
symbol of suffering of all women and children in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
   Sophia gave birth to her daughter on March 1 in a tree above
swirling floodwaters just an hour before a helicopter rescued her
and took her to safety. She had been in the tree four days without
food during the flooding, which covered large swaths of the
southern African nation and drove thousands from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, she has been living with her husband, the baby and
their two other children in a squalid house shared with dozens of
others. The house is in a tent camp housing some 5,000 flood
victims in Chibuto, 125 miles northeast of the capital, Maputo.
</P>
<P>
   Her rescue, captured on television, sparked international
attention. A businessman phoned a local radio station offering to
pay for Rositha's upkeep, and several other offers of support
followed. But weeks later, none of the promises has materialized.

<HEADLINE> N.J. Man Admits To CD Scam  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A man admitted Friday that he used more than
2,400 aliases to buy thousands of music CDs from mail-order
companies at introductory rates.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Joseph Parvin got $425,000 worth of music -- 26,554
CDs -- for about $125,000, said Special Agent Tony Esposito of the
Postal Inspection Service.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutor Scott Christie said Parvin is the most
prolific music-by-mail cheat in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   By using different names, Parvin was able to buy the CDs at
introductory rates, typically nine free with the purchase of one.
Parvin said he sold the CDs at flea markets.
</P>
<P>
   Parvin, 60, of Lawrenceville, faces up to 5 years in prison and
a fine of $250,000 at sentencing for mail fraud on June 13.
</P>
<P>
   After he had spent $107,000 at one mail-order house, BMG Music
Service, the company alerted postal authorities, Esposito said.

<HEADLINE> Troubled Head Start program to shut down two centers  </HEADLINE>
ngwicfls
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDHAM, Conn. (AP) -- The town school system is the first choice
to take over management of an area Head Start program after an
investigation by state and federal officials led to the shutdown
last week of two facilities in Willimantic.
</P>
<P>
   But state and federal officials say negotiations between the
Access Agency, which owns the building, and the state agency that
provided bonding for renovations are delaying the deal.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal officials charged the Windham School Readiness
Council and the town's human services department with finding new
management and placing children after the Access Agency's
facilities were closed for the remainder of the school year.
</P>
<P>
   The council has found alternate day care placement for 22 of the
46 preschoolers and four of the 26 infants and toddlers displaced
by the site closings.
</P>
<P>
   The council voted Thursday in favor of a proposal that would
name the Windham school system as the new management organization
for the Valley Street facility.
</P>
<P>
   Council Chairman Susan Collins said the proposal recommends the
school system take over the facility, contingent upon the
availability of funding.
</P>
<P>
   The Access Agency surrendered its licenses after a yearlong
investigation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
and state health and social services officials.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the federal health department, said site
inspections raised concerns about the training of the staff,
conditions of the centers and the communication with parents.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Children and Families is also
investigating allegations of abuse at the facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Access shut down two of six day-care
classrooms at a Head Start facility in Vernon and placed at least
three staff members on paid administrative leave.
</P>
<P>
   The DCF and state Department of Public Health are investigating
two incidents involving the disciplining of one child and the lack
of attention given to another, said Mary Oliver, Vernon's liaison
to the Access agency.
</P>
<P>
   A estimated 36 children between ages 3 and 5 were displaced by
the classroom closings, Oliver said.
</P>
<P>
   Access also operates day-care centers in Stafford, Thompson,
Putnam, Sterling, Brooklyn, and one more in Windham.

<HEADLINE> Grand jury indicts man accused of videotaping girls in locker room  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUEENSBURY, N.Y. (AP) -- A Vermont man accused of sneaking into
an elementary school locker room wearing a woman's wig to videotape
young girls was indicted by federal and county grand juries.
</P>
<P>
   One of three counts in the federal indictment against George E.
Hall, 61, alleges that the Starkboro resident videotaped nude
girls, who were minors, in the Queensbury Elementary School locker
room.
</P>
<P>
   Police accused Hall of sneaking into the locker room on March
12. But the indictment handed up Thursday by a Warren County grand
jury charges him with illegally going into the locker room also on
two other occasions. He also faces charges he promoted a sexual
performance by a child and possessed a sexual performance by a
child for videotaping at least one child who was partially nude in
Queensbury and nude girls on a beach in the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   Hall faces seven felonies and seven misdemeanors that are
punishable by up to 31 years in state prison. In addition to the
sexual performance counts, he faces charges of burglary,
eavesdropping, possession of an eavesdropping device, criminal
impersonation and endangering the welfare of a child.
</P>
<P>
   The federal indictment also includes charges that Hall brought a
videotape containing child pornography to Warren County. If
convicted under the federal indictment, Hall faces a maximum
penalty of 15 years in prison and a fine of $250,000. The date for
his arraignment in federal court has not been set.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, who was being held in Warren County Jail without bail, is
to be arraigned in county court Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hall's lawyer, Gregory V. Canale, was in court Friday and could
not be reached for comment.

<HEADLINE> Forum Addresses Currency Trading  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An international forum studying how to prevent
future financial crises like the one that engulfed Asia in 1997 and
1998 will propose adopting a code of good practices to govern
currency trading, a source familiar with the group's report said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Financial Stablity Forum, which is meeting this
weekend in Singapore, will recommend against trying to directly
regulate hedge funds, according to the source, who briefed
reporters on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Hedge funds are highly leveraged investment devices such as
Long-Term Capital Management, whose near collapse in 1998 sent
shockwaves through global financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   The stability forum is composed of finance officials from the
world's seven richest industrial countries as well as major
developing nations and multinational finance organizations,
including the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The group will hold discussions Saturday and Sunday in Singapore
and will release the findings of three task forces created last
year to study ways to improve the global financial architecture.
The U.S. delegation will be led by Timothy Geithner, under
secretary of the Treasury for international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The forum's chairman is Andrew Crockett, general manager of the
Bank for International Settlements in Switzerland, which serves as
an international coordinating group for the world's central banks.
</P>
<P>
   A major recommendation will be for development of a code of good
practices to govern currency trading, the source familiar with the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   It is expected that development of the code could follow the
process used the Foreign Exchange Committee, a group of currency
market participants who provide advice to the Federal Reserve in
New York, which conducts currency operations for the U.S.
government.
</P>
<P>
   The forum will also reach a conclusion that hedge funds and
other large financial institutions, including banks, have the
capability of destabilizing financial markets in developing
countries and for that reason, a code of good practices should be
developed, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   The forum will also recommend that offshore banking centers
provide greater disclosure of their activities, something the
Clinton administration has been pushing for as part of its effort
to halt illegal money laundering activities, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations on hedge funds are similar to proposals put
forward by the President's Working Group on Financial Markets last
April. That panel recommended stronger disclosure requirements for
hedge funds but no new regulatory structure.
</P>
<P>
   The 3,000 or so hedge funds operating in the United States are
largely unregulated although there are a number of federal agencies
that oversee banks and securities firms who loan money to the
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Hedge funds are highly leveraged investment devices often used
to speculate on relative differences in interest rates among
different types of securities. The securities are often purchased
with less than 5 percent of actual investor capital with banks
putting up the balance.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve helped arrange a $3.6 billion bailout of
Long-Term Capital by a group of major banks and brokerage firms in
the fall of 1998. At the time, there were concerns that a collapse
of Long-Term Capital, coming after Russia defaulted on $40 billion
in bonds, could destabilize the entire global financial system.

<HEADLINE> 5 Mozambicans Die Scrambling For Aid  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE COHEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- Desperate flood victims rushed at aid
trucks in a Mozambique camp, resulting in chaos that left five
people dead and 10 injured, officials said Friday, blaming a badly
organized relief mission.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether the victims of Thursday's incident were
trampled to death or run over by one of the aid trucks bringing
supplies to Chaqualane camp, said Foreign Minister Leonardo Simao.
</P>
<P>
   ''A crowd came in because everybody wanted to get some (aid). It
seemed some of the distributors panicked, and maybe a driver wanted
to run away with his truck or something like that,'' said Simao,
who oversees relief efforts in this flood-stricken southeast
African country.
</P>
<P>
   UNICEF spokesman Ian Macleod said he had received two
unconfirmed reports that people had rushed en masse toward the
trucks as the aid was unloaded.
</P>
<P>
   The government has ordered an inquiry into the incident.
</P>
<P>
   The charity distributing the aid, the Brazil-based Universal
Church of the Reign of God, had not gone through the World Food
Program or the government, Simao said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This should not happen. The desire to help should not create
more problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Church officials could not be contacted for comment.
</P>
<P>
   About 50,000 people are housed at the sprawling Chaqualane camp,
the biggest of more than 120 centers for the estimated 450,000
people displaced by floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
   Aid distribution remains a major problem, with many areas still
only accessible by air, and reported cases of malaria, cholera and
other diseases are reaching new highs.
</P>
<P>
   However, repeated floods that have ravaged Mozambique since
early February might finally be about to end, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems the conditions are going to improve. We are getting
to the end of the rainy season,'' Simao said.
</P>
<P>
   Silvano Langa, head of the country's disaster management agency,
said water levels in the flooded Limpopo River, swelled by rains in
neighboring South Africa and Zimbabwe, were expected to peak on
Friday at the town of Chokwe, about 125 miles northeast of the
capital Maputo. The water rose throughout the day, but it was
unclear whether it peaked.
</P>
<P>
   The town was hit by a wall of water late last month, forcing
people to seek refuge in trees and on rooftops and await rescue by
helicopter. This time, people had heeded warnings to evacuate to
higher ground, Langa said.
</P>
<P>
   Water department officials reported subsiding water levels in
other rivers around the country, where there had been fears of more
flooding. Forecasters predicted several days of clear weather.

<HEADLINE> Fed Publishes 'Pay Day' Loan Rule  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve published a rule Friday to
make clear that businesses offering so-called ''payday loans'' must
disclose to customers in writing the loans' annual interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The short-term, high-interest cash advances against borrowers'
paychecks, often provided by storefront lenders, can carry
triple-digit interest rates on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
   With its new rule, the Federal Reserve clarifies that payday
loans are subject to terms of the Truth in Lending Act. That means
the lender must disclose in writing, before a transaction is
completed, the loan's finance charge and its annual percentage
rate.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank's staff attorneys previously considered payday
loans to fall under the Truth in Lending Act, but the new rule
makes that interpretation official. The rule took effect Friday,
but compliance is voluntary until Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Payday loans recently have come under criticism by consumer
groups and members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Democratic lawmaker proposed legislation this month
aimed at restraining the business. Rep. John LaFalce of New York,
senior Democrat on the House Banking Committee, cited a survey by
consumer groups that showed a borrower can pay interest of 400
percent or more on an annual basis for payday loans.
</P>
<P>
   LaFalce's bill would prohibit federally insured banks from
making payday loans either directly or through affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the industry maintain that some payday loan companies
skirt the law in the 19 states that ban them by teaming with
nationally chartered out-of-state banks.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the payday loan industry acknowledge problems,
including cases of excessive use of ''rollovers'' in which
consumers, unable to repay the loans, have them extended for two
weeks or so. But they insist new federal regulation is not needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our product fills a tremendous market need and is
enthusiastically embraced by millions of working Americans,'' Billy
Webster, president of the company Advance America and head of the
Community Financial Services Association, said recently.
</P>
<P>
   The industry earned an estimated $1.4 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Payday loans work this way: You need money today, but payday is
a week or two away. You write a check dated for your payday and
give it to the lender. You get your money, minus the interest fee.
In two weeks, the lender cashes your check or charges you more
interest to extend, or ''roll over,'' the loan for another two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The typical fee for a $100 cash advance is $15. Industry
officials say that is reasonable compared with the fees banks
charge for bouncing a check, which average $22.
</P>
<P>
   The 19 states and two U.S. jurisdictions that ban payday loans
are Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Connecticut, Georgia, Maine,
Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New
York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Vermont,
Virginia, West Virginia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

<HEADLINE> Lab That Damaged Satellite Defended  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW FORDAHL, AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- An equipment malfunction or software
glitch probably caused the mishap that cracked a satellite's solar
panels during preflight testing, the mission's project manager said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The 850-pound spacecraft was undergoing a test Tuesday to ensure
it could withstand launch when a vibration table at NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory applied 10 times more force than was
intended.
</P>
<P>
   ''The building shook, as opposed to something that was just
shaking the spacecraft,'' said Peter Harvey, project manager of the
$75 million High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager mission.
''Everybody knew something was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest instance of bad luck for NASA and JPL, which
last year failed in two high-profile missions to Mars.
Investigators have criticized the agency and lab for poor training,
lax management and other flaws.
</P>
<P>
   But Harvey, who is based at the University of California,
Berkeley, said the lab should not be blamed for the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not something that was human error -- it looks like the
machine or software or something,'' he said. ''I think JPL is
getting hammered here, and it's not fair. They're the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the sun-watching spacecraft's solar panels must be
replaced; the cost of repairs has not been determined. The launch,
originally scheduled for July, has been pushed back to at least
January.
</P>
<P>
   NASA was expected to quickly appoint a board to determine the
cause of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite was designed to study the physics of solar flares
during its three-year mission.

<HEADLINE> NATO Sets Up Kosovo Neutral Zone  </HEADLINE>
By MISHA SAVIC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Ignoring local Serb
opposition, NATO peacekeepers Friday tacked up signs to mark a
neutral zone on the northern, Serb-controlled side of the main
bridge in the heart of this ethnically divided city.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO-declared ''confidence zone'' now reaches from the
southern, ethnic Albanian side of the main bridge across the Ibar
River, to the opposite, Serb-controlled, bank.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs in northern Kosovska Mitrovica -- the largest all-Serb area
in Kosovo -- oppose the formation of the zone, meant to allow free
passage and communication between areas held by rival Serbs and
ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs destroyed several signs that prohibit gatherings,
demonstrations, firearms and two-way radios along the river, only a
few hours after they were posted.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Ivanovic, a local Serb leader in this ethnically split
city, expressed doubts NATO would actually enforce the zone.
Ivanovic told The Associated Press the security zone was
''unnecessary'' in the Serb sector, since ''all trouble comes from
the Albanian half of town.''
</P>
<P>
   Serb ''bridge guardians'' equipped with two-way radios monitor
the two spans over the Ibar River to prevent massive passage by
ethnic Albanians. Their unofficial headquarters -- the Dolce Vita
cafe positioned next to the main bridge -- would be included in
NATO's confidence zone.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeepers ''will make a terrible mistake if they tried to
enforce the zone,'' said a ''bridge guardian'' who identified
himself only as Djole. ''We know they're doing all this for
Albanians to take everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, peacekeepers set up the confidence zone on the
southern, ethnic Albanian-controlled side of the bridge. The zone
was to be expanded north on Thursday, but it was delayed.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, NATO's military commander for Europe, Gen. Wesley
Clark, and Secretary-General Lord Robertson postponed a trip to the
volatile industrial northern city.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with them cited logistical problems, but speculation
was that the move was meant to reduce potential trouble on the
first anniversary of the start of the NATO bombing campaign that
led to a pullout of Serb forces from Kosovo and the entry of NATO
and U.N. contingents.
</P>
<P>
   They visited the provincial capital, Pristina, instead.
Robertson acknowledged that much more needed to be done to secure
peace in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ''The conflict may be over,'' he said. ''But the peace is still
to be won.''

<HEADLINE> Richardson Expects OPEC Oil Boost  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- OPEC members are likely to agree to raise crude
oil production at next week's meeting, U.S. Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's essential at the meeting they take action to correct the
instability of oil prices,'' he told a news conference in London.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's comments followed a round of talks with members of
the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, including
Algeria, Nigeria, Indonesia and the United Arab Emirates. OPEC
members meet Monday at Vienna, Austria.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears OPEC has agreed to increase production,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said that seven of the 11 members of the cartel
recognize a need for an oil increase.
</P>
<P>
   He did not name the holdouts, but Libya, Iran and Algeria have
expressed opposition to increasing oil output. Iraq, too, has
objected to Western demands for production rises.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said he believes a ''sizable'' increase is needed,
but wouldn't elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market should dictate numbers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC oil ministers are widely expected to reach an agreement at
their meeting to boost world petroleum supplies. But it remains
unclear if the increase will be sufficient to quickly reduce oil
prices from the highest levels since the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Cutbacks by oil producers in 1998 and 1999 to try to bolster
prices that had fallen to 12-year lows have sent crude prices
soaring. They hit a nine-year high of $34.37 a barrel on March 8 in
intraday trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Prices have eased in recent days in anticipation of an OPEC
agreement to increase output. But oil rose Friday amid questions on
how far OPEC would go. The main blend of U.S. crude rose 71 cents
Friday to $28.02 a barrel in contracts for May delivery on Nymex.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expect OPEC to raise output by a million barrels a day
or more. But experts say that at least 2 million barrels to 2.5
million barrels daily are needed to replenish depleted inventories
and satisfy growing demand.
</P>
<P>
   It may be in OPEC's interest to help provide some price relief.
If high oil prices start damaging the economies of importing
countries, demand for oil will plunge and OPEC revenue could
decline.
</P>
<P>
   Also, non-OPEC producers that have cut production in tandem with
the cartel, including Mexico and Norway, have said they will review
their policies after OPEC ministers act.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson spoke here after meeting with the United Arab
Emirates' oil minister, Obaid bin Saif Al-Nasseri. He described the
session as ''very productive.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said that while many OPEC officials 40 days ago were
talking about continuing production cuts, ''today, the consensus
seems to be for a production increase.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ''Our diplomatic efforts have made a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the United States would like to see OPEC increase
production to close the gap between world demand for crude of 75
million barrels and the current supply of about 73 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC countries produce about 35 percent of the world's crude.

<HEADLINE> Committee Recommends New Antibiotic  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A government advisory committee recommended
approval of an important new type of antibiotic Friday for battling
drug-resistant bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   The Anti-Infective Drugs Advisory Committee recommended approval
of Zyvox for treatment of pneumonia, skin infections and
vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, a germ infamous for
causing deadly infections in the abdomen, urinary tract,
post-surgical wounds and even heart valves.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA is not bound by advisory committee recommendations, but
usually follows them.
</P>
<P>
   Zyvox has been widely hailed for its effectiveness against germs
that have grown resistant to other medicines, including vancomycin,
now the drug of last resort for lingering infections.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturer, Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, said Zyvox can be
delivered via injection, tablets or liquid
</P>
<P>
   The advisory committee voted 10-0 to recommend approval of the
drug for treating community-acquired pneumonia and uncomplicated
skin infections and 9-1 in favor of its use in vancomycin-resistant
enterococcus, hospital-acquired phenomena and complex skin
infections.
</P>
<P>
   But some committee members indicated that they hadn't seen
sufficient data to approve the drug for certain other proposed
uses.
</P>
<P>
   They split 5-5 over its use in staphylococcus infections
resistant to the antibiotic methivcillin and 7-3 against
recommending it for penicillin-resistant staph infections
associated with community-acquired pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   However, the vote was in favor of the drug's use when those same
infections were associated with hospital-acquired disease, where
drug-resistant germs are more common.
</P>
<P>
   Zyvox, made by Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, works only against
gram-positive bacteria, so-called because of the way they turn
purple when stained. More than half of all serious infections
treated in hospitals worldwide are gram positive. These include
staph, strep and enterococci bacteria that cause pneumonia and
infections of the skin, bloodstream and urinary tract, among other
things.
</P>
<P>
   Often these infections are caught while patients are in the
hospital for other things. They tend to be resistant to many of the
standard antibiotics in use since the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The primary side effects found in clinical trials of Zyvox were
nausea and headache, which the company said occurred in about five
percent of patients.
</P>
<P>
   Zyvox is likely to be reserved for particularly ill patients,
especially those with bugs resistant to older drugs. It will join
another new antibiotic, Aventis' Synercid, which was approved by
the FDA last fall.

<HEADLINE> Chi Trade Board, Options May Merge  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE CARPENTER, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Board
Options Exchange are discussing a possible merger as the exchanges
strive to retain their dominant positions in the face of increasing
electronic competition.
</P>
<P>
   Letters traded by the chairmen of the two exchanges this week
indicate that the CBOE has hired an investment banker to look into
merger possibilities with Board of Trade bankers.
</P>
<P>
   The exchanges declined comment on the talks Friday, but reliable
sources confirmed the existence of the letters as reported by the
Chicago Sun-Times and Chicago Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   Any possible merger still remains far in the future because of
all the hurdles that would need to be cleared, said one source
close to the situation, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional markets with trading floors have been scrambling to
reorganize to better stave off the threat from low-cost competitors
providing electronic markets for financial products.
</P>
<P>
   The 152-year-old Chicago Board of Trade, which trades futures
and options on agricultural and financial products, lost its title
as the world's No. 1 futures market last year to the all-electronic
Eurex, which is based in Frankfurt, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Its plan to reorganize into two for-profit corporations, one
focused exclusively on electronic trading of futures contracts, has
provoked a dispute over trading rights with CBOE -- the world's
leading options exchange, which the Board of Trade formed in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   The options exchange, which trades options on stock indexes and
individual stocks, says the restructuring would violate a 1992 deal
linking trading rights at the two exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   A merger would be one way to resolve that dispute, over which
the Board of Trade has threatened legal action. Members of both
exchanges told the Sun-Times that a merger could help both.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a unique opportunity to accomplish something
significant,'' CBOE Chairman William Brodsky wrote to David
Brennan, his counterpart at the Board of Trade.
</P>
<P>
   In his reply, Brennan agreed to postpone legal action for two
weeks, ''expecting our investment banking teams will be able to
work out a plan for our consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   A merger would mean job losses within the industry. But Lee
Stern, a longtime Board of Trade member, said merger talks ''will
be a benefit to everybody involved.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Military To Quit Mozambique  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most of the U.S. troops, aircraft and
equipment sent to Mozambique early this month to provide
humanitarian flood relief will begin returning to their home bases
in Europe next week, the Pentagon announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said the pullout decision follows the Mozambique
government's determination that civilian agencies are now capable
of handling the remaining relief requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Since March 6, the U.S. military has delivered more than 1{
million pounds of cargo, including more than 1 million pounds of
humanitarian relief supplies, and flown more than 1,100 aid
workers, assessment team members, U.S. military and other
passengers in support of international relief operations in the
southern African nation.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 450,000 people have been displaced by floodwaters
that have ravaged Mozambique since February.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors plan to rely on statements by co-defendant for some keyevidence  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- An X-rated movie star was hoping big winnings in
the stock market would free her from the sex trade, according to
evidence gathered for the insider trading trial of a former top
Wall Street executive.
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn Gannon, marketed as Marylin Star, is a fugitive in a
criminal case brought against James McDermott Jr., the former chief
executive officer at Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan,
federal prosecutors have included some of more than 100 pages of
testimony before the Securities and Exchange Commission by a third
defendant, Anthony P. Pomponio.
</P>
<P>
   The statements show that Pomponio believed Gannon was
essentially a prostitute who catered to ''a clientele of lawyers,
stockbrokers and such, high level people.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said they had wanted to tell a jury about Gannon's
profession to show why McDermott might have wanted to impress her
and why Pomponio might have believed others gave her reliable stock
tips in return for sex.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood, though, decided Thursday that
Gannon can be referred to only as a model, a dancer and an actress,
a ruling that will force some of Pomponio's testimony to be kept
from the jury.
</P>
<P>
   She also ordered an editing of some of the statements made by
Pomponio during interviews with SEC staff attorneys last April and
October.
</P>
<P>
   Portions of a government transcript of the interviews were filed
along with arguments by prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   According to the transcript, Pomponio told the lawyers that he
assumed Gannon was a prostitute because it is a ''known fact that
most porn stars are prostitutes.''
</P>
<P>
   ''She indicated she knew high level people,'' he said. ''I guess
it was bragging, puffing, whatever you'd like to call it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pomponio said Gannon told him she traded stocks and hoped it
would get her out of the sex business.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like to go into a business in stocks or something to
that order,'' he said she told him.
</P>
<P>
   ''All she ever said to me was she did well,'' Pomponio recalled
of her conversations about her investments. ''She was doing well
where she could be out of this business which I didn't know if I
even believed or not, to tell you the honest truth.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the transcript, Pomponio told the lawyers he met
Gannon at the Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City when she was there
for a trade show, signing autographs.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also said in the court filing that they planned to
paraphrase for the jury oral statements Pomponio made to the
lawyers on the telephone after their formal interview.
</P>
<P>
   During those conversations, prosecutors allege, Pomponio said
Gannon told him she had received a stock tip from a ''big shot''
Wall Street type who was in love with her and who may have been one
of her ''clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Denis J. McInerney, a lawyer for McDermott, has argued in court
papers that detailed, contemporaneous handwritten notes by the SEC
lawyers of their interviews with Pomponio conflicts with what
prosecutors plan to tell the jury Pomponio said.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott, Pomponio and Gannon are each charged with conspiracy
and securities fraud. Prosecutors allege the trio made more than
$170,000 in illegal profits.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott, 48, of Briarcliff Manor, and Pomponio, 45, of North
Caldwell, N.J., remain free on bail. Gannon, 30, formerly of Miami,
Fla., is believed to be living in Canada, where prosecutors are
seeking her extradition.

<HEADLINE> Tension Around FDA Drug Approval  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The government's system for approving drugs is
coming under renewed scrutiny after a number of widely used
medicines have been linked to deaths or serious illness.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the Food and Drug Administration moves too quickly
and puts the drug industry's interests ahead of patient safety. As
evidence they point to seven drugs that have been pulled from the
market or severely restricted in the past three years. This week
alone the diabetes drug Rezulin and the heartburn drug Propulsid
were added to the list.
</P>
<P>
   ''The FDA is acting in a reckless way to make sure they are not
alienating the industry,'' said Sidney Wolfe, director of the
Public Citizen Health Research Group and frequent critic of the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   FDA officials insist their system works, but they stress all the
side effects of drugs cannot be known until after a drug is
approved, and is taken by tens of thousands of patients. Typically,
drugs are only tested on about 3,000 people before getting
approved.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no truth to the idea that we are any easier on drug
approvals,'' said Dr. Robert Temple, FDA's associate director for
medial policy.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA acknowledges there has been a spate of recalls, but says
that when viewed over the course of several years, the percentage
of drugs pulled from the market has remained stable.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the drug industry agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1980, there have been 528 medicines approved and only 12
or 2 percent have been recalled because of safety reasons, said the
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufactures of America. ''The fact
that only 2 percent have been withdrawn shows two things: The
benefits of marketed drugs outweighs the risks, and the safety
system in place is working,'' said spokesman Jeff Trewhitt.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA accelerated its drug review process during the 1990s
after Congress complained it was taking too long to approve
life-saving medicines.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s it usually took almost three years for the agency
to approve a drug. Today, the average approval time is one year.
For drugs the FDA deems breakthrough medicines, it knocks the
review time down to six months.
</P>
<P>
   The acceleration process was shepherded by then FDA commissioner
David Kessler, who now wonders about how far it's gone.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to be mindful that the pendulum has not swung too
far,'' Kessler said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   As drug recalls have made headlines in recent years, Congress
has begun to pay closer attention to whether the FDA is doing its
job properly.
</P>
<P>
   In January, a study the General Accounting Office, Congress'
investigative arm, concluded the FDA lacks the ability to properly
track problems with drugs after they hit the market. The office
recommended that pharmacists work more closely with doctors in
prescribing and monitoring drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem might be related to the drug industry's
increased use of consumer advertising, which is spurring more sales
of newer drugs. Rapid introduction of new drugs means that doctors
have less experience with them before they are taken by millions of
people.
</P>
<P>
   ''We tend to want to see the upside of pharmaceuticals and tend
to forget they all have risks, something we see with the drugs that
have been withdrawn,'' Kessler said.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe said the FDA has been too reluctant to take drugs off the
market once it discovers problems. He said the agency is too
reliant on adding warning labels to the drugs -- a system that can
fail if doctors fail to read them.
</P>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert's Rezulin was approved in 1997 after just six
months of government review because regulators deemed it a crucial
new therapy. But within a year the drug was linked to serious liver
problems and deaths. The FDA placed several restrictions on the
drug last year, and on Tuesday the agency decided to ban it
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   One key factor in the FDA's decision to ban the drug now was the
fact that two alternatives were approved last year, Avandia and
Actos.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA also tried to use warning labels to when it discovered
problems with Johnson &AMP; Johnson's Propulsid. It changed the
labeling five times since the drug was approved in 1993 as it
learned about new situations when the drug could cause illness or
death. On Thursday, with prodding from the FDA, the company said it
would stop marketing the drug which had $950 million in sales in
1999 and it would stop distributing it to drug stores in July.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, J&AMP;J will make the pill available for a limited basis to
certain patients who cannot take alternative medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of J&AMP;J on Friday fell $8.75, or 11 percent to $71.25 on
the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Jewish Groups Angered Over Film  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A Jewish organization is angry about what it
calls deceptive advertising about a television film, ''The Rabbi,''
that reportedly ends with the lead character converting to
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   The film is scheduled to be broadcast on the 43 Pax-TV
affiliates across the country at midnight on Saturday. It was
advertised this week in several Jewish publications, including The
Jewish Press and The Jewish Week.
</P>
<P>
   A TV Guide ad about ''The Rabbi'' describes it as ''the
unforgettable story of an Israeli rabbi and his struggles in modern
society. The drama of this family relationship will move and
inspire you.''
</P>
<P>
   The film was produced by a San Diego-based Christian
organization, Morris Cerullo World Evangelism, according to the
Jewish Community Relations Council of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nothing other than a proselytizing tool attempting to
deceive Jews to abandon their own religion,'' said Michael Miller,
the council's executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   He said the film ends with the lead character converting to
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone calls to the Cerullo organization were not returned on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Udell, a spokeswoman for Pax-TV, said ''The Rabbi'' was
airing as a paid program, like an infomercial.
</P>
<P>
   ''It does not reflect any of the views or opinions of Pax TV,''
Udell said.
</P>
<P>
   The film was broadcast Wednesday in Syracuse, where the Syracuse
Jewish Federation called it ''an outrage to the entire Jewish
community.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Cerullo has a long history of engaging in attempts to convert
members of our community,'' Miller said. ''With this latest
manifestation of his missionary tactics, he has stooped to a new
low. If Rev. Cerullo believes his message is so powerful, why does
he resort to deceit.''
</P>
<P>
   The TV Guide ad for ''The Rabbi'' contains a coupon that people
can use to receive a free ''priestly blessing plaque.'' The coupon
is to be sent to a San Diego post office box.

<HEADLINE> SEC Makes New Accounting Standards  </HEADLINE>
By NOELLE KNOX, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Securities and Exchange Commission is
cracking down on the ''game of nods and winks'' some companies play
to make their revenues and profits match rosy projections.
</P>
<P>
   As hundreds of companies scramble to comply with the new SEC
accounting guidelines designed to give investors a more accurate
picture of how a company is performing, investors are bracing for
some bad surprises.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the SEC gave most companies until June 30 to comply,
a three-month extension from the original March 31 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The stricter standards are being imposed at a time when public
companies are under extreme pressure to report steadily rising
profits in order to justify the stock market's current lofty
valuations. For Internet startups that don't have any profits, the
ability to show strong increases in revenues is key.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of several smaller technology companies were beaten down
this week amid fears the accounting changes will produce
worse-than-expected financial reports. The guidelines will also
affect blue-chip companies like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and UAL Corp.,
the parent of United Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   An early casualty was MicroStrategy Inc., which saw its shares
plummet 62 percent Monday after the computer software company said
it had to restate its financial results for the past two years
because of the new guidelines. (The company later revised its
explanation and said it was complying with a 1997 accounting rule
that addressed a related problem.)
</P>
<P>
   The revisions were needed because MicroStrategy said it had
counted too large a portion of revenue from multiyear contracts in
the first year rather than spreading those revenues over the length
of the deals. The change erased all of MicroStrategy's profits for
1999, producing a loss on its books. The company said its long-term
prospects remained good, regardless of when it counts revenue from
its contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden shock of MicroStrategy's stock market selloff caught
several high-technology companies in the downdraft. Shares of Covad
Communications Group Inc., Infospace.com Inc. and Ventro Corp. all
fell this week.
</P>
<P>
   While Covad and Infospace took steps to reassure skittish
shareholders that the companies' books meet the new guidelines, the
average investor has little way of knowing if a company is fudging
the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really difficult from publicly available disclosures to
determine who will be the next one,'' said Janet Pegg, an
accounting analyst with Bear Stearns &AMP; Co., who published a report
on the topic. ''There's a lot of concern and there's no obvious way
to get any comfort.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Securities and Exchange Commission issued the
guidelines in December, at least 63 companies have changed their
accounting practices and at least 66 more companies have warned
investors they are still evaluating the potential impact.
</P>
<P>
   In that second group is Ventro Corp., an Internet company that
sells technology research equipment and materials to businesses.
Ventro, formerly Chemdex, recently told investors in a public
filing, ''If we are required to change our accounting policies, we
may in the future report substantially lower revenues, and we may
be required to restate the results from earlier periods. This could
cause the market price of our common stock to fall significantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventro's stock fell 31 percent this week, closing Friday down
$5.43} at $108.62{ on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
   Executives for Ventro, who are preparing to sell more stock,
declined further comment citing the SEC mandated ''quiet period''
in advance of a stock sale.
</P>
<P>
   The new guidelines are designed to stop businesses from
massaging their financial records.
</P>
<P>
   Too many companies are operating in ''a gray area where the
accounting is being perverted; where managers are cutting corners;
and, where earnings reports reflect the desires of management
rather than the underlying financial performance of the company,''
said Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, in a 1998 speech. ''Too many corporate managers,
auditors and analysts are participants in a game of nods and
winks.''
</P>
<P>
   So last December the SEC issued a Staff Accounting Bulletin 101,
which effectively put companies on notice that regulators are
taking a hard line on when companies may count revenues and costs
for projects under way or products under contract.
</P>
<P>
   A retailer, for example, can't take credit in its books for the
sale of a bedroom set or a blouse on layaway until payments are
received. Many big names like Wal-Mart and The Limited Inc. have
said they will take charges in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   As will several airlines, which have to change the way they
calculate revenue from their frequent flyer programs.
</P>
<P>
   Still other companies, like defense contractor Raytheon Co.,
will have to restate financial results for the past three years,
effectively wiping out $40 million in profit.
</P>
<P>
   While in many cases the changes seem academic and they don't
effect a company's cash flow, the tighter accounting standards may
cause quite a few companies to miss Wall Street's estimates for
quarterly profits.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are going to be some surprises,'' said Bear Stearns'
Pegg.

<HEADLINE> N.Korea Campaigns Against Atrocities  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- North Korea brought its campaign to expose
what it says were U.S. atrocities during the Korean War to the
United Nations on Friday, demanding an international tribunal to
investigate and prosecute American GIs.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare press conference, North Korean Ambassador Li Hyong
Chol accused U.S. troops of carrying out massacres, indiscriminate
bombings, germ warfare and torture that resulted in the deaths of 1
million North Koreans.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most savage methods in history were employed by the U.S.
troops massacring innocent Korean people during their temporary
occupation of areas of the north,'' Li said.
</P>
<P>
   For years, North Korea has claimed the U.S. forces committed
massacres during the 1950-53 Korean War. But the reclusive
communist government has stepped up its anti-U.S. statements in
recent months ahead of the 50th anniversary in June of the outbreak
of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Historians say North Korean troops committed atrocities as well.
U.S. officials have dismissed most of the North Korean claims as
propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ellen Glynn, the spokeswoman at the U.S. mission, said the
United States had heard the North Korean allegations before ''and
they were without basis in fact and they are groundless now as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Li said recent reports of U.S. killings of civilians in South
Korea during the war were just part of the picture and that the
Foreign Ministry had decided to take its own accusations to the
press to demand a thorough investigation of U.S. actions,
compensation for its people, and an official apology from the U.S.
government.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations ''should take measures to establish a
tribunal to investigate the criminal acts of the U.S. troops and to
punish those responsible in accordance with international law,'' Li
said.
</P>
<P>
   Chances for such a tribunal are remote, however.
</P>
<P>
   With the United States the most powerful U.N. member, holding
veto power in the Security Council, there is little chance the
United Nations would create a tribunal even if it wanted to.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said the United Nations would not
comment since it had not seen a request from Pyongyang, which was
first made in a statement from the Foreign Ministry carried
Wednesday by the official news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Washington led the U.N. forces that fought with South Korea
against North Korean invaders, who were backed by China and the
former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the call for a tribunal, spokeswoman Glynn
referred to an ongoing investigation by the U.S. government into
allegations U.S. soldiers killed Korean civilians at No Gun Ri in
central South Korea in the early days of the war.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 29, The Associated Press reported that U.S. Army
veterans, corroborating the accounts of Korean villagers, said
their unit killed a large number of civilian refugees at No Gun Ri
in July 1950. The villagers say about 400 people were killed,
including 100 in a preceding attack by U.S. warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   In a second report Oct. 13, citing veterans, Korean witnesses
and U.S. military documents, the AP said hundreds of other South
Korean refugees were killed by U.S. forces in other incidents in
the Korean War's first weeks, many when two bridges were blown up
as civilians streamed across.
</P>
<P>
   The governments of the United States and South Korea previously
dismissed the claims, but opened investigations after the AP report
was published.

<HEADLINE> Man Pleads Guilty in Frankel Probe  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- A man pleaded guilty Friday to helping
indicted financier Martin Frankel launder money by handling large
transfers of cash from a Swiss bank account.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Miller, 60, of Peekskill, N.Y., admitted he received
$10,000 a week transferred from a bank in Switzerland and then
withdrew the majority of the funds in cash to deliver to Frankel in
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Stephen Robinson said that from August 1998 to
April 1999, Miller received more than $330,000.
</P>
<P>
   Transactions in excess of $10,000 trigger currency reporting
requirements for banks. By withdrawing amounts just under the
limit, Miller and Frankel conspired to evade reporting the
transactions, Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel, a former money manager from Greenwich, is accused of
bilking more than $200 million from insurance companies in five
states. He is awaiting extradition from Germany, where he was
arrested in September after a four-month international manhunt.
</P>
<P>
   Miller faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine when
he is sentenced June 22.

<HEADLINE> Possible Nazi Paintings Probed  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN FINUCANE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- The Museum of Fine Arts is joining other major
museums in publishing lists of paintings in their collections that
may have been plundered by the Nazis during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The museum said Friday its list would include about 12 to 15
paintings. It said it still has questions about the paintings'
histories and hopes the public can help.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think it's the right thing to do,'' museum director Malcolm
Rogers said. ''The truth is, we've taken our research so far. Now
is the time to bring these paintings into the public domain. The
answers may not lie within museum walls.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum identified the paintings by reviewing the times and
places when the works changed hands or whether they passed through
the hands of people implicated in Holocaust-era looting.
</P>
<P>
   Similar announcements have been made in recent weeks by the Art
Institute of Chicago, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York
and the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles. The Smithsonian
Institution, which runs the National Gallery of Art, said this
month it would publish a list by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The World Jewish Congress, which has worked for the return of
Holocaust victims' assets from banks, insurers and art museums, had
pushed museums to release information on the histories of pieces in
their collection.
</P>
<P>
   ''We welcome the spirit of openness and cooperation,'' said Elan
Steinberg, the group's executive director. ''We're trying to
achieve justice, or more precisely only a measure of justice,
because it's 50 years too late.''
</P>
<P>
   The group estimates about 200 of the nation's 750 art museums
might hold art plundered from victims of the Nazis.

<P>
   NORTH STONINGTON, Conn. (AP) -- The federal Bureau of Indian
Affairs issued a preliminary ruling Friday that would give the
Eastern Pequot and Paucatuck Eastern Pequot tribes federal
recognition, possibly clearing the way for more casinos in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   The tribes, which share a 224-acre reservation, meet the
criteria for federal recognition, including maintaining a
continuous historical government-to-government relationship with
the state since colonial times, the BIA said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
   The Eastern Pequots have had a reservation in the state for more
than 300 years and had members listed on the federal census since
1900, the BIA said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Paucatuck Eastern Pequots ''wept tears of joy''
at the news, said their chief, James Cunha.
</P>
<P>
   ''It means yes, we are an Indian tribe,'' Cunha said. ''We're
very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunha said the immediate plan of the 45-member tribe is to work
on a final comment on their application, which must be filed with
the Bureau of Indian Affairs within the next 180 days.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau can modify or reverse its ruling; recognizing a
combined entity, both petitioners, or either tribe separately. But
Cunha said he was confident the preliminary ruling would be upheld.
</P>
<P>
   He could not say whether the tribe planned to open a casino, but
he acknowledged a casino is ''one of the options we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Developer Donald Trump last year signed a deal which would allow
him to build a casino for the Paucatucks.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut currently has two federally recognized tribes, the
Mashantucket Pequots and the Mohegans. Both tribes operate highly
successful casinos in southeastern Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we plan to do at this point is still a ways away. We're
taking this one step at a time,'' Cunha said.
</P>
<P>
   The Eastern Pequots could not be reached for comment. Messages
were left at their offices.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said the state was notified
of the decision at 5:30 p.m. but has not received a copy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will review the decision and will consult with the
governor's office as well as our congressional delegation and the
affected towns,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The applications of the Paucatuck and Eastern Pequots have been
marked by infighting and a dispute over whether the groups
constitute two tribes, or different factions of the same tribe, the
Pequot Indians, who were given the reservation by 17th Century
colonial leaders after war nearly wiped them out.
</P>
<P>
   The towns of North Stonington, Ledyard and Preston have opposed
the tribes' effort to gain federal recognition. The three towns
have collectively spent about $120,000 fighting the process.
</P>
<P>
   North Stonington First Selectman Nick Mullane had not seen the
full decision Friday night, but said the two-page press release
from the BIA was confusing.
</P>
<P>
   ''The information is not consistent with what we've found,''
said Mullane.
</P>
<P>
   He and other opponents have criticized the BIA's handling of the
application, saying the towns were cut out of the process.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of their actions are just about criminal about how they
treated the towns and the state,'' said Mullane.
</P>
<P>
   The tribes had been rejected for federal recognition before.
</P>
<P>
   Genealogists said they thought the tribes were splinter groups
from already-recognized tribes in Connecticut or Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Their new applications contained more details and research they
hoped would support their claims.
</P>
<P>
   Other tribes in the state currently seeking federal recognition
are the Schaghticokes in Kent and the Golden Hill Paugussetts in
Colchester and Trumbull.

<HEADLINE> Whitman wants constitutional guarantee to expand Megan's Law  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Fearful that courts will continue to reject
attempts to make information about convicted sex offenders widely
public, the Whitman administration is preparing an amendment to the
state's Constitution to allow much broader community notifications.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the governor said the proposed amendment could
be made public as early as Monday, the same day the Assembly is
scheduled to consider a bill that would post information about sex
offenders on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''We led the nation with Megan's Law,'' said Whitman spokesman
Pete McDonough. But now New Jersey lags behind other states that
can legally list sex offender registries on the World Wide Web, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are real concerns about this running afoul of the
Constitution. We have been working on a constitutional amendment,''
McDonough told the Associated Press on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment would allow authorities to make ''evenhanded and
ultimately constitutional'' notifications that would be wider in
scope than what courts have allowed so far, McDonough said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We certainly don't want what is appropriate to be tied up in
court,'' McDonough said.
</P>
<P>
   The state's Megan's Law categorizes convicted sex offenders into
three levels, based on the perceived danger they present. For those
labeled most dangerous, the law allows prosecutors to provide an
offender's name, address and photo to residents living in a
carefully defined area.
</P>
<P>
   A federal court judge ruled late last year that the state's
rules routinely allowed private information about sex offenders to
become public during community notifications. The judge ordered the
state to revise its regulations or he would shut down the system.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday Attorney General John J. Farmer, Jr. released new
guidelines requiring people who receive notices to sign papers
promising to keep the information secret.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Joel Weingarten, R-Essex, has proposed a bill that
would put information about sex offenders on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   At least 15 other states are allowed to do so because their
versions of Megan's Law pose no constitutional conflicts in their
states, Weingarten said.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature needs to push such proposals and not worry about
the courts, Weingarten said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we need to move away from an active judiciary and a
judiciary that attempts to engage in the legislative process,'' the
lawmaker said.
</P>
<P>
   An amendment would do just that, Weingarten said, and any
measure ''that ensures the safety of our children is the most
appropriate method.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonough said the governor's staff has met ''for some time''
with leaders in the Legislature on the proposed amendment. He
declined Friday to make a copy public.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would not be surprised if all the i's are dotted and the t's
are crossed, we could have the amendment ready by Monday,''
McDonough said.
</P>
<P>
   Any amendment would need approval from both the Assembly and
Senate. Then it must win voter approval in a statewide referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Megan's Law is named for Megan Kanka, a 7-year-old Hamilton
Township girl who was raped and murdered in July 1994 by a
convicted sex offender who lived across the street from her Mercer
County home.

<HEADLINE> Adirondacks sees more applications for communication towers  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL GORMLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Plans for communications towers among the
towering pines of the Adirondacks are being made this year at a
rate that is sending warning signals to environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals for five more communication towers and upgrading of
others in the state-protected forest have surfaced since the
beginning of the year and that's a serious concern, according to
the Adirondack Council, an environmental advocacy group. One in the
early stages of planning would place the first tower on the summit
of a scenic mountain where no road reaches -- yet.
</P>
<P>
   ''In many instances these are transmitting to the trees,'' said
Adirondack Council spokesman John Sheehan. ''There are no people
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   More of the 100-to-200-foot towers in the mountain park are
aimed at blanketing coverage for cell phones and other
communications, rather than the 75 percent minimum set by federal
law, Sheehan said. The number of requests for towers is only likely
to increase, he said, with the growing demand for high-definition
television and other technology.
</P>
<P>
   But worse of all, Sheehan fears the Adirondack Park Agency that
regulates development in the park doesn't have a clear idea of how
many towers are already added to the landscape. That's because he
said the environmental group has been unable to obtain a map of
these towers from the state agency for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Such a map exists, although it is two years old, said John
Banta, director of planning for the Adirondack Park Agency. Banta
said the agency keeps track of towers and tries to make sure any
new communications equipment is added to an existing tower or
erected to a tower near other towers. He said he isn't sure how
many new proposals have been submitted recently, but said cellular
technology has created an increase in applications in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Personnel who handle the issue for the agency weren't available
Friday, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he doesn't know of any tower proposals that have been
rejected. The agency, however, tries to limit the effect of these
towers on the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest recent proposal -- for three towers -- isn't for
cellular phone companies, but to provide emergency communications
to a county's hinterlands.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are not a lot of people there, but if you're one of them
the tower is important,'' said David Wickerham, administrator for
Saratoga County, which plans to erect three towers in its northern
towns.
</P>
<P>
   The rugged terrain, high treeline and valleys of the Adirondacks
require the new towers, he said, in order for residents to get
quick and reliable ambulance, police and fire services.
</P>
<P>
   One of the recent proposals would add a cellular telephone tower
in the Northampton area, one would add another phone tower near
Lake George, and the three would be in northern Saratoga County,
Sheehan said.
</P>
<P>
   One of those Saratoga County towers would be on top of Mount
Anthony, a mountain 60 miles north of Albany with a sheer cliff
side and no roads to the summit. That would change if the tower is
built.
</P>
<P>
   To ease the effect on the scenery of the tourist area,
environmentalists have pushed for so-called pine-tree towers. These
are towers that are camouflaged to blend in with the scenery, often
in the guise of a pine tree.
</P>
<P>
   But that is expensive. Saratoga County officials said the
designer towers could cost twice as much as the $1.1 million
budgeted for the towers and have an environmental drawback. That's
because cellular phone equipment can't simply be added at a later
date to a tower that is camouflaged and that could force another
tower to built.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an extreme drawback, we think,'' said Robert Stokes, a
town supervisor on the county committee running the tower project.
</P>
<P>
   Before any tower is built or expanded, however, several
environmental reviews will be conducted, said Jennifer Post,
spokeswoman for the state Department of Environmental Conservation.
The agency has a say in any development in the state park through
the state Adirondack Park Agency, she said.

<HEADLINE> Michael Ross jury stuck on legal question  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) -- The jury in the Michael Ross death
penalty case Friday got stuck on a complex question of law -- a
question for which the judge did not have an answer.
</P>
<P>
   The problem centers around the state Supreme Court's prior death
penalty decisions, and how to interpret them to Ross' case.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers on both sides, sometimes appearing exasperated by the
legal gymnastics of the problem, were asked to come back to court
Monday with researched proposals on how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   State's Attorney Kevin Kane asked Superior Court Judge Thomas
Miano for the broadest interpretation. Defense lawyers argued for
an interpretation that errs on the side of Ross, whose life is
hanging in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there's any error, let's err on the side of life for the
defendant,'' attorney Barry Butler argued.
</P>
<P>
   The jury began deliberating Friday on whether Ross should get
life in prison or the death penalty for kidnapping and killing four
teen-age girls in eastern Connecticut in the 1980s. Three of the
girls also were raped.
</P>
<P>
   But most prior Supreme Court rulings in death penalty cases deal
with one killing, most recently the case of Sedrick Cobb, whose
conviction was upheld in the killing of a Watertown woman he
kidnapped, raped and threw off a bridge to her death in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   To get the death penalty, a jury must find that the killing was
especially cruel, heinous or depraved and that there are no
mitigating factors that could spare the killer's life.
</P>
<P>
   Mitigating factors include the killer's background and history,
as well as the facts and circumstances of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors asked Miano to clarify how to consider mitigating factors
-- whether they could apply to just some and not all of the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''The question, I think, is somewhat problematic,'' Miano said,
adding that there is no Connecticut precedent for handling multiple
murders in death penalty cases.
</P>
<P>
   Kane argued the mitigating factors should be applied
independently.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Ross claims he suffered from a mental disorder
called sexual sadism, causing violent sexual fantasies, when he
raped and killed the girls. But in the case of Leslie Shelley, who
was not raped, the killing was done because she witnessed the
killing of her friend, April Brunais, and could identify Ross if he
let her go, Kane said.
</P>
<P>
   Butler and defense attorney Karen Goodrow said if the jury finds
one mitigating factor, whether it has to do with the crimes or
Ross' history, the factor must apply to all the cases.
</P>
<P>
   Ross, 40, already is serving two life sentences for killing two
women in Windham County. He claims to have killed two other women
in New York, but he has not been prosecuted.

<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- A 10-year-old girl who was dragged after her
clothing got caught in a school bus door died Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit girl, whose name was not released, had been in
critical condition since the accident Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The girl was getting off the bus at Thomas Houghton Elementary
School when the vehicle started moving, dragging her about 10 feet
before the driver noticed.
</P>
<P>
   The bus is owned by Robinson Bus Co., which operates 82 routes
in the Detroit Public School district. General manager Henry
Foutner said the driver was placed on leave, but police said the
driver probably won't be charged.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is an accident, certainly not intentional,'' said Dale
Goby, interim director of student transportation for Detroit Public
Schools. ''But any time you have a serious injury like this it's

<HEADLINE> Mayor of Brazilian City Ousted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- A judge ruled Friday that the mayor of
South America's largest city must step down immediately to face
charges of misconduct and illegal enrichment, court officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Olavo Pereira da Silva accepted a petition by public
prosecutors claiming that Mayor Celso Pitta had illegally received
loans totaling about $465,000 from Sao Paulo businessman Jorge
Yunes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The loans were in fact gifts,'' prosecutor Saad Mazlone
claimed in a televised interview.
</P>
<P>
   The petition also said Pitta should be fined up to $1.4 million
and be barred from holding public office for up to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Pitta can appeal the ruling but must leave office while he does.
Vice Mayor Regis de Oliveira was expected to take over as mayor of
Sao Paulo.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a Sao Paulo state court ruled Pitta should step down
on another charge of illegal use of public funds, but he was
allowed to remain in office pending an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Pitta, considered one of Brazil's most unpopular mayors, is also
battling a battery of accusations made by his ex-wife and son, who
have accused him of running a massive corruption ring, tampering
with investigations and bribing legislators.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Students March For Computers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Carrying signs and chanting, three
dozen children, parents and staff from a rural elementary school
marched a half-mile to the state Capitol on Friday to ask for
computers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need computers. We need them now,'' they chanted on the
Capitol steps.
</P>
<P>
   Ammer Johnson, a teacher at the Lockeford School, about 40 miles
southeast of Sacramento, said the kindergarten-through-sixth-grade
school has 400 students but only 18 computers, all but five of them
obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why should all the other schools have computers and we
don't?'' asked sixth-grader Eliot Hayes, 11. ''The future is
basically going to be using computers.''
</P>
<P>
   The school's assemblyman, Republican Anthony Pescetti, told the
group he will try to include $50,000 for the school in the state
budget.
</P>
<P>
   California may be riding an economic boom led by the computer
industries of the Silicon Valley, but the state ranked last in
students per computer in 1999, at 8.1, compared with a national
average of 5.7, according to Education Week magazine.

<HEADLINE> Man Falls Five Stories, Walks Away  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALNUT CREEK, Calif. (AP) -- Chris Hoyle heard the scream and
looked up from her desk to see a man falling past her window -- head
first.
</P>
<P>
   ''His head was down, his feet were up, and he came whizzing by
screaming,'' she told the Contra Costa Times.
</P>
<P>
   She ran outside and shouted to a man near the five-story
building, ''Is everyone all right? I just saw a man fall off the
roof.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Yeah, that would be me,'' Ken Larsen, 34, told her. His arm
was scratched and his shoulder bruised, but nothing was broken. In
fact, he said, he landed on his feet.
</P>
<P>
   Larsen had been laying telecommunications cable on the roof,
walking backwards and pulling it. His co-worker holding the spool
yelled, ''Hold it a minute,'' but Larsen was already stepping back
-- and off the edge.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway to the ground, Larsen realized he might survive. The
cable he still clutched was slowing his fall.
</P>
<P>
   On the roof, Rick Williver, 46, had thrown his weight against
the spinning spool. When the cable stopped unwinding, he peered
over the edge.
</P>
<P>
   Five stories below, Larsen was walking around.
</P>
<P>
   After unwinding 65 feet of cable and crashing through tree
branches, he had landed on his feet. ''It was like landing after a
parachute jump,'' Larsen said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers, governor unify on regulating 'extreme wrestling'  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Gov. Christie Whitman and legislative
leaders from both sides of the aisle Friday promised a crackdown on
so-called ''extreme wrestling'' entertainment events, which they
denounced as dangerous and too gruesome for children.
</P>
<P>
   Now the legal grappling begins.
</P>
<P>
   It was Whitman herself who enacted a change in law in 1997 to
deregulate so-called ''pro wrestling'' so that sponsors like the
World Wrestling Federation would be willing to stage TV events at
New Jersey facilities without regulation and taxes from the State
Athletic Control Board.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the governor at the bill signing ceremony was WWF star
''The Undertaker.''
</P>
<P>
   An unwanted byproduct, according to a recent report in The
Star-Ledger of Newark, has been the emergence of extreme wrestling,
where the flash and theatrics of WWF events are replaced by grim
displays of mayhem and real bloodshed with weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are afraid one of these events will end with a call
for a real undertaker.
</P>
<P>
   ''Extreme wrestling is a grotesque and depraved activity,'' said
Assemblyman Joseph Doria, D-Hudson, who as mayor of Bayonne found
himself helpless to stop such events in his city.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman, Doria and Senate President Donald DiFrancesco said they
wanted to require regulation and taxation of these events, to give
towns like Bayonne the option to reject permits, and to bar
children from attending.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sitting them in a room where the main goal is to draw blood
while fans yell encouragement is not the entertainment nor the
example that our children should be seeing,'' Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   A draft of the legislation that will parse the difference
between ''extreme'' and ''pro'' wrestling was not available Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The legislative challenge here is to protect legitimate
professional wrestling while giving the state and municipalities
the legal means to control the violent sport of extreme
wrestling,'' Doria said.
</P>
<P>
   Doria is leader of the Democratic minority in the Assembly, and
he and DiFrancesco have forged an important bipartisan bridge in
the Legislature on the issue. But the differences between the two
entertainment events could become a delicate matter.
</P>
<P>
   If you slam a metal chair against somebody's face, you face 10
years in prison for aggravated assault -- unless you do it in front
of a paying crowd. If you pretend to hit your foe and he spews fake
blood, it's ''pro'' and it's legal. If you actually hit your foe
and the red spray from his face is real blood, it's ''extreme'' and
it would be illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Hering, WWF vice president for legal affairs, said he
thinks state policy can be designed to treat ''pro'' and
''extreme'' wrestling differently. ''They are absolutely
distinctive.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Sarnelli, a researcher for the Assembly Democrats, said
while ''pro'' wrestling may highlight fake violence with occasional
accidents, ''extreme'' wrestling features deliberate injury.
</P>
<P>
   ''Legally we can make a distinction between the two because one
of them is a health and safety violation and one of them is not,''
Sarnelli said. ''The legislation that we are working on is going to
be a work in progress. We haven't got the final language down
pat.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Our primary focus is that there are parents bringing
5-year-old children to these matches,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Smoker's Lawyer Wants $115M  </HEADLINE>
By BOB EGELKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Jurors on Friday began deliberating whether
to award punitive damages against the nation's two largest tobacco
companies to a dying ex-smoker.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for Leslie Whiteley and her husband asked jurors for
$115 million in punitive damages, saying the cigarette makers
remain unrepentant for the harm they cause.
</P>
<P>
   ''All they care about is money,'' attorney Madelyn Chaber told a
Superior Court jury that has already awarded $1.7 million to the
couple. The jury deliberated Friday and planned to continue Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Philip Morris Cos. and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
Holdings Inc. said they have already gotten the message, noting the
$206 billion settlement reached in 1998 by cigarette makers and 46
states suing over health costs.
</P>
<P>
   David K. Hardy, a lawyer for Philip Morris, suggested punitive
damages of two to three times the amount awarded so far, or $3.4
million to $5.1 million. Reynolds lawyer Jeffrey Furr did not
propose an amount.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the jury awards a substantial amount, Chaber countered,
''they'll be breaking out the bottles of scotch in the boardroom,
toasting the fact that they got away with it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Deliberations began after 3{ days of testimony and arguments
about the companies' conduct and finances, factors they must
consider in deciding on punitive damages. Votes of nine of the 12
jurors are needed for a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict in Whiteley's favor Monday was the first for a
smoker who started smoking after 1969, when surgeon general's
warnings first appeared on cigarette packages.
</P>
<P>
   Of the five other jury verdicts in the nation in favor of
individual smokers, two in Florida and one in New Jersey were
overturned on appeal; an $80 million verdict in Portland, Ore., was
reduced to $31 million by the trial judge; and a $51 million
verdict against Philip Morris in San Francisco a year ago was cut
in half by Superior Court Judge John Munter, who is also presiding
over Whiteley's case.

<HEADLINE> Two Dead in Shooting in Illinois  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EFFINGHAM, Ill. (AP) -- A former sheriff's deputy walked into a
state Transportation Department office early Friday, shot his wife
to death at her desk and then shot himself, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   James M. Calvert, 41, who was ordered to undergo counseling for
anger and depression after a 1992 conviction for harassing a
witness, left no evidence he intended to harm anyone but himself
and his estranged wife, Karen Calvert, 37.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no indication this is anything other than a domestic
dispute,'' Effingham Police Chief John Lange said. ''No one else
was in danger.''
</P>
<P>
   Only seven other workers were in the office at 7:21 a.m. when
Calvert fired the fatal shots, Lange said. Employees heard the
gunfire, came running and found the Calverts' bodies on the floor
near a 9 mm handgun, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The couple separated last April, and Lange said investigators
learned they had fought often since then. James Calvert had custody
of their two children, ages 16 and 18. They are now with
grandparents.

<HEADLINE> BIA recommends two tribes for federal recognition  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH STONINGTON, Conn. (AP) -- The federal Bureau of Indian
Affairs issued a preliminary ruling Friday that would give the
Eastern Pequot and Paucatuck Eastern Pequot tribes federal
recognition, possibly clearing the way for more casinos in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   The tribes, which share a 224-acre reservation, meet the
criteria for federal recognition, including maintaining a
continuous historical government-to-government relationship with
the state since colonial times, the BIA said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
   The Eastern Pequots have had a reservation in the state for more
than 300 years and had members listed on the federal census since
1900, the BIA said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Paucatuck Eastern Pequots ''wept tears of joy''
at the news, said their chief, James Cunha.
</P>
<P>
   ''It means yes, we are an Indian tribe,'' Cunha said. ''We're
very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eastern Pequots had a similar reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is truly a historic day for my tribe,'' said Mary
Sebastian, tribal chairwoman. ''After 20 years of waiting, we are
pleased that the BIA finally agrees that our tribe has maintained
its social, cultural and political identity as a sovereign
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunha said the immediate plan of his 45-member tribe is to work
on a final comment on their application, which must be filed with
the Bureau of Indian Affairs within the next 180 days.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau can modify or reverse its ruling; recognizing a
combined entity, both petitioners, or either tribe separately. But
Cunha and Sebastian said they were confident the preliminary ruling
would be upheld.
</P>
<P>
   Cunha could not say whether the tribe planned to open a casino,
but he acknowledged a casino is ''one of the options we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Developer Donald Trump last year signed a deal which would allow
him to build a casino for the Paucatucks. Calls to the Trump
organization were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut currently has two federally recognized tribes, the
Mashantucket Pequots and the Mohegans. Both tribes operate highly
successful casinos in southeastern Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we plan to do at this point is still a ways away. We're
taking this one step at a time,'' Cunha said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mashantucket Pequots, who have supported the idea of
recognizing the Eastern and Paucatuck Eastern Pequots as a single
entity, would not speculate on what the ruling will mean to the
future of gaming in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still believe they are one and the same tribe. But if they
choose to go separate ways and the federal government agrees with
them, then God bless them,'' said Mashantucket Pequot councilman
Michael Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said the state was notified
of the decision at 5:30 p.m. but has not received a copy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will review the decision and will consult with the
governor's office as well as our congressional delegation and the
affected towns,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The applications of the Paucatuck and Eastern Pequots have been
marked by infighting and a dispute over whether the groups
constitute two tribes, or different factions of the same tribe, the
Pequot Indians, who were given the reservation by 17th Century
colonial leaders after war nearly wiped them out.
</P>
<P>
   The towns of North Stonington, Ledyard and Preston have opposed
the tribes' effort to gain federal recognition. The three towns
have collectively spent about $120,000 fighting the process.
</P>
<P>
   North Stonington First Selectman Nick Mullane had not seen the
full decision Friday night, but said the two-page press release
from the BIA was confusing.
</P>
<P>
   ''The information is not consistent with what we've found,''
said Mullane.
</P>
<P>
   He and other opponents have criticized the BIA's handling of the
application, saying the towns were cut out of the process.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of their actions are just about criminal about how they
treated the towns and the state,'' said Mullane.
</P>
<P>
   The tribes had been rejected for federal recognition before.
</P>
<P>
   Genealogists said they thought the tribes were splinter groups
from already-recognized tribes in Connecticut or Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Their new applications contained more details and research they
hoped would support their claims.
</P>
<P>
   Other tribes in the state currently seeking federal recognition
are the Schaghticokes in Kent and the Golden Hill Paugussetts in
Colchester and Trumbull.

<HEADLINE> Russians Ban Travel in Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SLEPTSOVSKAYA, Russia (AP) -- Russia banned nonmilitary travel
around Chechnya on Friday, fearing rebel assaults ahead of Sunday's
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military, which claims that Chechen rebels often
pose as civilians to move around the republic and regroup,
apparently wants to prevent gatherings on election day. Security
has also been tightened at Chechnya's 336 polling stations, the
military command told the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether the travel ban, in effect through Monday,
would restrict civilians from going to polling stations.
</P>
<P>
   According to the military command, rebels plan to attack the
Russian-held towns of Gudermes, east of the capital Grozny, and
Argun to the south in an effort to derail the voting. In the past,
Russia has warned of rebel attacks that did not materialize.
</P>
<P>
   The main rebel forces are concentrated in Chechnya's southern
mountains, where there are about 2,000 fighters, said Col. Gen.
Valery Manilov, the first deputy chief of the Russian General
Staff, quoted by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Manilov said yet another 1,000 rebels have descended from the
mountains and spread over Russian-controlled territories to prepare
new attacks. Also, about 400 militants remained in the capital
Grozny, which Russian forces captured last month, he said,
according to ITAR-Tass.
</P>
<P>
   Despite routine detentions of fighting-age Chechen men by
Russian troops, federal forces appear unable to prevent rebel
surprise raids on Russian positions.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight Friday, rebels in an armored personnel carrier opened
fire on a Russian checkpoint near Chervlyonnaya-Uzlovaya, deep in
the federally controlled northern plains, the military command
said. The rebels later fled, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday and overnight Friday, rebels shelled Russian police
checkpoints near the towns of Achkhoi-Martan and Kurchaloi in the
southern foothills, and fired grenade launchers at two Russian
checkpoints in Grozny, the report said. No federal casualties have
been reported.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no major outbreaks of violence have been reported in
Chechnya during the past days. Officials in Moscow said they are
worried that a lull marked preparations for a new assault by
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Yastrzhembsky, the presidential spokesman on Chechnya,
said Thursday that the rebels could be waiting until the snow melts
in the mountains. Rebels then could move more easily and vegetation
would give them additional cover, posing new difficulties for
Russian forces.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, Russia claimed to have seized a man believed to be
the rebels' chief financier. Alexander Zdanovich, a spokesman for
the Federal Security Service, said the man, indentified only as
Beriyev, had made trips abroad to seek financing for the rebels,
according to ITAR-Tass.
</P>
<P>
   Russian ground troops entered Chechnya in late September, after
rebels invaded the neighboring Russian region of Dagestan last
summer. The military swept across the plains in the north quickly,
but have been stalled for several weeks at the foothills of the
mountains that cut across Chechnya's southern third.
</P>
<P>
   Manilov said Friday that 1,991 Russian servicemen and 13,000
rebels had been killed since the operation against the militants
began in Dagestan. The figures could not be independently confirmed
and both sides are believed to exaggerate the others' losses and
minimize their own.

<HEADLINE> SWAT Hoax Staged To Plant Bug  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- It looked like something out of the
movies: A heavily armed SWAT team moved in last July to try to talk
sense into a burglar holed up in a car as a television crew
followed the action.
</P>
<P>
   And just like the movies, none of it was real.
</P>
<P>
   The Albuquerque Police Department revealed in a recent court
hearing that the burglar was actually a police officer. The
operation was staged to allow police to plant a court-approved
eavesdropping device inside the home of a 12-year-old murder
suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Jade Gonzales was accused of killing her father in June. Her
attorney has said the shooting was accidental.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had planned this operation, and they had even practiced
it,'' Detective Steve Hall said at a hearing earlier this month
involving Jade.
</P>
<P>
   Charges against her were dismissed after a judge ruled police
deprived Jade of her rights in questioning her. Police Chief Gerald
Galvin has said there was no misconduct that warranted dismissing
charges, and the dismissal is being appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Hall testified that police used the ruse because there was no
pattern to when people were home at the Gonzales house. A
lieutenant decided the department would have an officer pose as a
burglar running from police in the area, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   ''And we had SWAT move in to try to apprehend the subject, and
we tried to pull everybody else out for officer safety and citizen
safety reasons,'' he said. ''And when they were removed from the
residence, that's when the device was placed in, under ruse.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't clear how many people were evacuated, but it involved
more than the Gonzales home.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Ed Chavez Jr. said Thursday he believes police
could have installed the device by simply telling his clients they
had a search warrant for the home.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a real problem with perpetrating a fraud on the
community,'' he said. ''It instills fear in people that isn't
really necessary.''

<HEADLINE> Bill Cosby's Sitcom Canceled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ''Cosby'' will take its final bow this season
on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Cosby's sitcom, which has slipped in the ratings in its
fourth season, won't return in the fall, the network announced
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going out with the graduating class of 2000,'' Cosby said.
''I wish we could have done better for CBS.''
</P>
<P>
   No decision has been made on the future of ''Kids Say the
Darndest Things,'' the children's interview show Cosby hosts for
CBS, the network said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cosby,'' which won its Monday time slot for three consecutive
years, fared poorly after being moved to Wednesday and then Friday
night. Viewership for ''Cosby'' fell from an average 16 million
viewers per episode in its first year to about 9 million this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Series co-star Madeline Kahn, who played neighbor Pauline, died
of ovarian cancer last December.
</P>
<P>
   The final episode will air Friday, April 28. Cosby will continue
working with CBS through a development deal and other projects, the
network said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cosby'' helped bring CBS out of a ratings slump when it
debuted in September 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone at CBS is proud that Bill chose to bring 'Cosby'
here, and we are thrilled that he will still be an important part
of the CBS family,'' said Leslie Moonves, president and chief
executive officer of CBS Television.
</P>
<P>
   Cosby has starred in several television series, including the
adventure drama ''I Spy'' from 1965-68, ''The Bill Cosby Show''
from 1969-71, and ''The Cosby Show'' from 1984-92.

<HEADLINE> German Rail Workers Call Off Strike  </HEADLINE>
By HANS GREIMEL, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Railway workers called off plans for a
weekend strike after reaching an agreement with management late
Friday to temper streamlining plans that unions say would cost up
to 70,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   After wrangling for more than 10 hours, Deutsche Bahn AG and the
main German railway union, GdED, resolved their main differences
shortly before midnight. Management will work on ways of cutting
costs without cutting jobs, and the union will hold off from
striking.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides, however, said that more negotiations would be needed
over the next three months to iron out the details.
</P>
<P>
   The union had threatened to target a major German city for a
three-hour work stoppage on Saturday and possibly an entire region
on Monday, if no agreement were reached Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bahn -- which posted losses last year for the first
time, to the tune of $85 million -- had put forward a plan to cut
personnel costs by $1.8 billion over the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Hartmut Mehdorn fueled concern by saying that could
entail a 5 percent annual reduction in the company's 252,000 jobs,
or roughly 12,500 jobs a year.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement reached Friday, management would not
implement any layoffs until 2002 and would seek other ways to cut
costs.
</P>
<P>
   GdED Chairman Norbert Hansen said the breakthrough takes the
threat of layoffs off the table but added that the railroad could
still reduce costs by slashing salaries, reducing work hours or
cutting bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we don't save money and keep making losses, we will see
ourselves in a very, very bad business situation in four years,''
said company spokesman Uwe Herz. The railroad, a government-owned
company, plans to go public perhaps as soon as 2003 and wants to
primp for future investors.
</P>
<P>
   The company's move to streamline its operations came at a time
when the country is struggling to tame its stubborn 11 percent
unemployment rate that has more than 4 million Germans out of work.
</P>
<P>
   During negotiations, Hansen had called for Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder to help resolve the dispute, but the government declined
to get involved. Fighting unemployment was cornerstone of
Schroeder's election bid.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sugar Refiners Tour Cuba  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Officials of top American sugar companies toured a
major Cuban operation on Friday, in a brief visit aimed at making
contacts for a possible post-embargo future.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was very cordial and went beautifully, but it is all for
the future,'' said Wayne Smith, senior fellow at the Center for
International Policy in Washington, which organized the trip. The
16-member delegation has also met with Cuba's ministers of foreign
trade and sugar during the five-day visit, which wraps up Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The group visited the Camilo Cienfuegos Sugar Central outside
Havana.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the conclusions drawn by members of the delegation was
that the interests of the American sugar refiners and the Cuban
sugar producers coincide,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course now, the embargo does not permit that kind of
relationship,'' said Smith. ''But this would be a natural
relationship if and when the embargo ends.''
</P>
<P>
   The American trade sanctions against the communist nation have
been in place since 1962, when they were imposed to punish and
force a change in Fidel Castro's government.
</P>
<P>
   Those sanctions have long been backed by many conservative U.S.
lawmakers and Cuban-Americans who say that renewed U.S. trade with
Cuba would help Castro's government. However, there has been
growing opposition to the embargo among some U.S. business
interests, particularly in the agricultural sector, looking for new
markets.

<HEADLINE> Gore Gets 650K in Campaign Funds  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- In a fund-raising musical chairs, of sorts, Vice
President Al Gore collected $650,000 for Democrats on Friday on
George W. Bush's home turf. The GOP Texas governor mined campaign
cash in Bill Clinton native Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not in the business of giving advice to Mr. Gore, but if I
were I would tell him to look elsewhere for votes because Texas is
Bush country,'' Texas Republican Party spokesman Robert Black said
as Gore headlined two evening Houston fund raisers for the
Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Gore sounded like he was well aware that he was trespassing on
''Bush country,'' as he addressed some five dozen patrons in the
home of trial lawyer Denman Heard and his wife, Laura.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by fresh orchids and the Heards' antique Chinese
porcelain and silks, Gore did not call his Republican presidential
rival by name, referring only to ''the other side'' and
''Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore thanked contributors for being ''willing, right here in
this state, to take the stand you're taking.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, Bush was in Arkansas, pulling in about $350,000
at a campaign fund-raiser in a Little Rock hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Arkansas people either loved Bill Clinton or they hated
him,'' said Chris Carnahan, executive director of the Arkansas
Republican State Committee. ''I think Gov. Bush is probably going
to carry Arkansas in the general election, especially lined up
against Vice President Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, DNC chairman Edward Rendell addressed long-standing
Republican gripes that trial lawyers made rich by what many in the
GOP consider frivolous lawsuits contribute huge sums to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   As Black put it, ''the trial-lawyer establishment in Texas is
very powerful and, at this point, has complete control of the state
Democratic Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before Gore, Rendell asked his patrons, many of them
trial lawyers, to think of the 100 most important consumer safety
advances in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eighty to 90 percent of those safety advances came from
litigation so I think we are proud as a party to have the support
of the trial lawyers. It is nothing we apologize for,'' Rendell
said.
</P>
<P>
   As the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Gore brought
his party $1.7 million during this two-day swing through
Cincinnati, Detroit and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Gore lashed out at Republicans in a written
statement from the White House timed to coincide with the 11th
anniversary of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said it was remarkable that ''Republicans in Congress have
responded to the recent rise in oil prices by again proposing to
drill in the Arctic refuge.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They would irrevocably destroy one of the last truly wild
places in America to enrich their friends in the oil industry and
secure less than half a year's supply of oil. President Clinton has
used his veto before to protect the Arctic from drilling and, if
necessary, is prepared to do so again,'' Gore said.

<HEADLINE> Trombonist Al Grey Dies at 74  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE RUSHLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Al Grey, a prolific jazz trombonist whose unique
plunger-mute style was recorded on nearly 100 albums, died Friday.
He was 74 and had suffered from several ailments, including
diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   While musicians don't like to compare themselves to one another,
bass player Milt Hinton, who gained fame as part of the Cab
Calloway Band, said Grey was certainly among the best of his
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Grey played with a litany of jazz's elite during his career,
including Benny Carter, Frank Sinatra, Lionel Hampton, Dizzy
Gillespie, Count Basie and Ella Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   His sound was marked by his use of the plunger mute, a technique
on which he wrote a book.
</P>
<P>
   Grey joined Count Basie in 1957 and played with him on three
separate occasions, the last from 1971 to 1977.
</P>
<P>
   In all, he recorded nearly 30 albums of his own and appeared on
another 70 records. Among them was the Grammy-nominated movie
soundtrack for ''The Color Purple.''
</P>
<P>
   Grey was born on June 6, 1925, in Aldie, Va. He learned to play
trombone from his father, who taught a neighborhood youth band in
Pottstown, Penn., said his son Albert Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the jazz trombonist followed in his father's footsteps,
teaching children in his Philadelphia neighborhood between gigs.
</P>
<P>
   ''With him, he just enjoyed playing,'' Albert Jr. said. ''He
wasn't always about getting paid. He would just come in. If he knew
some other players in a club, he would just pull out his horn and
play.''

<HEADLINE> Serbs Mark NATO Attack Anniversary  </HEADLINE>
By DUSAN STOJANOVIC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Several thousand Serbs, many waving
posters of President Slobodan Milosevic, rallied across Yugoslavia
on Friday to mark the first anniversary of the start of the NATO
air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout, however, was far lower than the 100,000 expected by
authorities, and for many Milosevic's claims of victory rang hollow
in a country where conditions have only declined since the severe
damage from the airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   ''What are you celebrating?'' a driver caught in a traffic jam
shouted at the runners participating in a race held for the
occasion. ''You better run from this miserable country, rather than
for Milosevic!''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition parties and many Belgrade residents said the
celebrations, which included the marathon race past the ruins of
buildings targeted in the bombing, were inappropriate -- even
bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   ''The defeats can be celebrated only by those who have not had
enough of the death and misfortune of this poor nation,'' said the
leading opposition Serbian Renewal party.
</P>
<P>
   About 5,000 people, mostly government supporters, attended a
state-sponsored rally in Belgrade to mark March 24, 1999 -- the date
NATO began 78 days of airstrikes aimed at ending Milosevic's
crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Similar rallies were held
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   Some 2,000 Serbs in neighboring Macedonia's capital Skopje also
rallied against NATO and burned pictures of U.S. flags and
Swastikas. Also in Greece, where resentment against NATO was high
during the air campaign, 2,000 people marched to the U.S. consulate
in the northern city of Thessaloniki, chanting ''NATO terrorists.''
The march ended peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   Some demonstrators at a Belgrade rally and rock 'n' roll concert
carried pictures of Milosevic, while others held banners reading:
''Slobo, You Are Chosen By God To Defend the Serbs.'' Pictures of
Gen. Ratko Mladic, the former Bosnian Serb military commander and a
U.N. court war crimes suspect, were also defiantly displayed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the mood among participants was subdued and lacked the
energy of similar protests held at the same place daily during the
NATO bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Top government officials laid flowers and wreaths on the ruins,
including the former Chinese Embassy hit by a bomb in what NATO
said was an accident.
</P>
<P>
   In the northern city of Novi Sad, some 2,000 Serbs lit candles
in memory of those killed in the strikes and set them by the ruins
of a Danube bridge destroyed by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally held by the state-run trade union in Belgrade, union
president Tomislav Banovic told NATO to ''go home, and peacefully
leave our land.''
</P>
<P>
   Zoran Djindjic, another opposition leader, said that instead of
protesting low salaries in Yugoslavia -- which amount to no more
than $50 and ''which workers in the West can earn in an hour'' --
the state trade union is ''celebrating 'the victory' against
NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The regime has proclaimed the start of the bombing as its
brightest moment, while ordinary people consider it a nightmare,''
Djindjic said. ''That says enough about the nature of this
regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite public disaffection, Milosevic's grip on power remains
unshaken a year after the bombing campaign destroyed all of the
country's oil refineries and crippled key bridges, factories and
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's divided opposition has failed to mount a serious
challenge to his rule or to respond to a growing crackdown on
dissent and economic downfall.
</P>
<P>
   Only some 100 yards from the state rally on Belgrade's Republic
Square, an anti-Milosevic student group -- Otpor, or Resistance,
distributed leaflets calling people to ''resist the regime.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a system, this is a disease,'' said one of the
leaflets. ''Bite the system, long live the resistance.'' Police
briefly detained 17 student activists at rallies throughout Serbia,
and one was severely beaten, Otpor said.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO bombing campaign forced Milosevic to withdraw his
forces and hand Kosovo, Serbia's southern province, over to NATO
peacekeepers and U.N. administrators.

<HEADLINE> Government Rejects Elian Arbitrator  </HEADLINE>
By MILDRADE CHERFILS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Federal officials on Friday rejected a proposal
from the Florida relatives of Elian Gonzalez that an arbitrator
decide whether staying in the United States or going back to Cuba
would be in the boy's best interest.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal came after the government issued an ultimatum on
Thursday to the relatives: agree to a speedy timetable for their
appeal of a federal court decision against them or the agency would
''immediately move to revoke'' Elian's status in this country.
</P>
<P>
   In response, attorneys for the Florida relatives said an
arbitration process could begin April 3 and be completed within two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But Doris Meissner, commissioner of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not an option that we are prepared to entertain,'' she
said. ''Our goal here is to reunite Elian with his father and to do
that as quickly, as promptly and as orderly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The ultimatum came in the wake of a federal judge's decision
this week affirming the U.S. government's decision to send the
6-year-old back to his father in Cuba. Meissner would not speculate
on the next step.
</P>
<P>
   In the proposal to the INS, attorney Kendall Coffey said the
boy's relatives had offered to abide by an arbitrator's decision.
Coffey suggested former Sen. Bob Dole or Sen. George Mitchell for
the position.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the INS would agree at last to provide a day in court to
this small child, the result would be not only a fair determination
of what's right for Elian, but a much faster resolution than is
possible through further court battles,'' Coffey wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating the denial by INS officials, Coffey said the
family's appeal of the federal court ruling would be filed by April
3.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, journalists and other observers criticized the
arbitration offer, saying it was another attempt to draw out the
boy's U.S. stay. During a live roundtable program broadcast by
Cuban state television, panel members also said they were
disappointed the boy's time in the United States could now be
extended for at least three more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was found clinging to an inner tube off Florida on Nov.
25. His mother and 10 other people drowned when their boat capsized
during an attempt to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The case quickly became a tug-of-war between the Cuban
government and U.S. family members who oppose the Cuban
government's Communist ideology and want to raise the boy.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Official Shot at Hotel  </HEADLINE>
By KEN GUGGENHEIM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- After the wounding of a former federal agent
linked to drug traffickers, investigators tried to determine Friday
if he was shot because of testimony he was due to give -- or whether
he was the target at all.
</P>
<P>
   Cuauhtemoc Herrera Suastegui, former coordinator of the federal
attorney general's organized crime unit, was wounded in an ambush
Thursday at a Mexico City hotel. His bodyguard was killed.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting came the day before Herrera was to appear before
the attorney general's office to testify in an investigation of the
Juarez drug organization.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's top drug prosecutor, Mariano Herran Salvatti, said at a
news conference Friday afternoon that the attorney general's office
was investigating whether Herrera ''was giving some kind of
institutional protection'' to the Juarez group.
</P>
<P>
   Herran said it's possible that Herrera's attorney, Silvia
Raquenel Villanueva, was the target of the attack. Raquenel, who
also was wounded in the attack, has defended several drug
traffickers and her office was bombed in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Herrera, Raquenel, bodyguard Sergio Alberto Chavez and another
woman were entering the hotel Thursday afternoon when at least four
gunmen began shooting, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez died at the scene. Herrera was in stable but delicate
condition Friday. The conditions of Raquenel and the other woman,
identified as an agent in the attorney general's anti-drug unit,
were not made public.
</P>
<P>
   Five people have been arrested; police are looking for a sixth.
Two of the five detained suspects tested positive for firing a gun,
authorities said at Friday's news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Herrera worked at the attorney general's office in the border
city of Tijuana, where many officials are on the payroll of drug
groups, before taking charge of the organized crime office at
Mexico City headquarters. Under him, that office captured two of
Mexico's most wanted suspects, kidnappers Daniel Arizmendi and
Andres Caletri.
</P>
<P>
   He was forced to step down in 1998 after reports surfaced that
he had failed a lie detector test. He was assigned to the attorney
general's office in Spain, then returned last year and worked for
agency's police force before resigning in January.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony to U.S. Congress on Feb. 29, a top Drug Enforcement
Administration official cited Herrera as an example of the Mexican
attorney general's office failure to adequately deal with
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   William E. Ledwith told a House subcommittee that Herrera
continued to work for the attorney general's office after failing
the lie detector test and after allegations that he had provided
assistance to the Juarez organization.
</P>
<P>
   A Mexican official told The Associated Press on condition of
anonymity Friday that Herrera had prepared a defense arguing that
his links with the Juarez organization were part of his job in
investigating the group, and that he had passed a second lie
detector test.
</P>
<P>
   Herrera fell under suspicion, the official said, when raids on
drug gang properties turned up documents with Herrera's name on
them.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting Thursday was the latest in a series of attacks in
recent weeks that appear to be related to drug violence.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who have been killed were the police chiefs of the
border cities of Tijuana and Reynosa, a prominent attorney in
Tijuana and the lawyer of an accused drug trafficker.

<HEADLINE> Newspapers Not Hot About Examiner  </HEADLINE>
By BOB EGELKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Hearst Corp. spent seven months getting
unenthusiastic responses from potential buyers of the San Francisco
Examiner before it decided to pay a small local publisher to take
the paper off its hands, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Definitely not interested ... good luck,'' The New York Times
Co. replied in August, according to federal court papers Hearst
filed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Couldn't make numbers work,'' said the McClatchy Co.,
publisher of the Sacramento, Fresno and Modesto Bee newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Can't see how to make $ there,'' was the reply quoted from the
Times Mirror Co., which later sold the Los Angeles Times to the
publisher of the Chicago Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Jones &AMP; Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, said it
wasn't interested in acquiring metropolitan newspapers,
''particularly failing metro newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   The filing, which described contacts with 81 potential buyers,
was intended to show that the Examiner's pending sale, and Hearst's
simultaneous $660 million acquisition of the San Francisco
Chronicle, will promote competition in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst asked U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker to dismiss an
antitrust suit by Clint Reilly, a political consultant, recent
mayoral candidate and unsuccessful bidder for the Examiner, who
says Hearst is engineering a monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly says Hearst's purchase of the Chronicle would reduce
competition in news and advertising. His lawyer, Joseph M. Alioto,
said Reilly plans to ask Walker for a restraining order blocking
the Chronicle and Examiner sales, which are expected to close on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Hearst announced it is selling the Examiner, its
120-year-old newspaper, to Ted Fang, publisher of the Independent,
a San Francisco newspaper distributed for free three times a week.
Fang says he will switch the afternoon Examiner to morning
publication in August and compete with the Hearst-owned Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   In the court papers Thursday, Hearst detailed its plans to
subsidize Fang by paying all costs in the first four months, $16
million in the next eight months and up to $25 million a year in
the following two years.
</P>
<P>
   Only two prospective buyers, Fang and Leucadia National Corp., a
New York-based firm that ''specializes in purchasing properties at
attractive prices,'' showed enough interest to continue
discussions, Hearst said. Rather than offering to pay for the
Examiner, both requested ''support payments'' of $25 million to $35
million a year, said Hearst lawyer Gary Halling.
</P>
<P>
   Knight Ridder Co., which publishes the San Jose Mercury News and
Contra Costa Times, also expressed interest, but only if the sale
included the Examiner's 50-percent share of the profits, guaranteed
by the 1965 joint operating agreement with the Chronicle, Halling
said.
</P>
<P>
   The JOA, which was to expire in 2005, was not part of the offer.
</P>
<P>
   An investment banker hired by Hearst to market the Examiner last
July contacted publishers, cable companies, Internet companies and
investment groups and aroused little interest, the court filing
said.
</P>
<P>
   The bids, including Reilly's, were reported after Hearst
expanded its offer in January to include delivery trucks and
printing presses. Fang's purchase does not include the Examiner's
presses, however.

<HEADLINE> Police Plan To Arm Sikhs in Kashmir  </HEADLINE>
By LAURINDA KEYS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SRINAGAR, India (AP) -- The government said Friday it will arm
Sikh villages in Kashmir, blaming this week's massacre of 35 Sikhs
on local Muslims militants and infiltrators from Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The killings on Monday were the first time Sikhs had been
targeted in the 10-year campaign by Muslim militants to separate
the Himalayan region of Kashmir from India.
</P>
<P>
   Home Secretary Kamal Pandey said his ministry, which is
responsible for internal security, suggested to the 130 villages in
Kashmir where Sikhs live to form defense committees, which would be
armed and trained by the government.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are in a near-war situation'' with separatist militants,
Inspector General of Kashmir Police Ashok Bhan told The Associated
Press. He said police were increasing operations in the area around
the village of Chati Singhpura in an attempt to capture the
killers.
</P>
<P>
   The attackers entered the village Monday, a day after President
Clinton arrived in India for a visit. The gunmen lined up men and
gunned them down, leaving their bodies strewn outside the village's
Sikh temple.
</P>
<P>
   Pandey said the attack was conducted by 17 gunmen -- most of them
infiltrators from Pakistan, along with five Kashmiri militants --
who entered the village from two sides.
</P>
<P>
   Pandey said Indian intelligence had earlier intercepted an
exchange between the militants and their controllers ordering them
to kill Sikhs, who were referred to in the transmissions as ''the
bearded ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Kashmiri militant groups based in Pakistan -- Lashkar e-Toibe
and Hizbul Mujahedeen -- conducted the attack, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The two main Pakistan-based militant groups and Pakistan's
government have denied involvement in the killings, and have
instead accused India's security forces of committing the murders
to defame the separatist movement during Clinton's visit.
</P>
<P>
   As the victims were being prepared for cremation Tuesday,
witnesses had told The Associated Press that the number of dead was
40. On Friday, police corrected that 35 were killed and two
wounded.

<HEADLINE> Cleric Urges Sainthood for Bishop  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- A Catholic official on Friday marked the
20th anniversary of slaying of a Salvadoran archbishop with a call
for his canonization.
</P>
<P>
   Sainthood for Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero would be ''a
significant gesture not only for El Salvador, but for all of Latin
America and for the entire Church,'' Monsignor Vincenzo Paglia told
Vatican Radio. Paglia is overseeing the cause for Romero's
canonization.
</P>
<P>
   Romero was an outspoken critic of human-rights abuses under what
was then El Salvador's far-right regime. He was shot and killed by
a sniper on March 24, 1980, as he raised the chalice over his head
to celebrate Mass in a San Salvador chapel.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N.-sponsored investigation blamed the killing on El
Salvador's far-right. The execution made Romero a symbol of a
12-year civil war that cost 75,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands have written letters urging his
canonization, Paglia said.
</P>
<P>
   Romero has been a difficult figure for the Vatican, in part
because some see him as coming close to the kind of extreme
political activism held in disfavor under John Paul II.

<HEADLINE> Blues 5, Lightning 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Al MacInnis scored his 300th and 301st career
goals Friday night, leading the St. Louis Blues to their fifth
straight victory, 5-1 over the Tampa Bay Lightning.
</P>
<P>
   MacInnis, who also had an assist, put the Blues up 2-0 at 7:54
of the first-period with a slap shot from the right point during a
power-play.
</P>
<P>
   He scored his second goal on a slap shot from the right circle
late in the second. The defenseman recorded his 1,100th career
point on a goal against Carolina on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis goalie Roman Turek, who picked up his 40th win, lost
his shutout bid with 4.7 seconds left on Wayne Primeau's goal.
Turek has 23 victories and four ties in his past 31 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues, with an NHL-best 105 points, lead Detroit by six
points in the Central Division. St. Louis established a
franchise-record with its 48th win and the Blues are two points
from the tying the team mark.
</P>
<P>
   The Lightning, who have won only twice in 13 games (2-10-1),
have one goal in the past eight periods.
</P>
<P>
   Lubos Bartecko scored on the Blues' initial shot of the game.
Stephane Richer scored a power-play goal late in the opening period
in his first game against the Lightning since being traded earlier
this season.

<HEADLINE> Thousands of French Teachers Protest  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Tens of thousands of teachers marched through Paris
on Friday in a protest demanding the resignation of the education
minister and more funds for schools -- the second such protest in a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Police said 55,000 teachers turned out for the protest in the
capital; organizers put the crowd at 100,000. Southern cities such
as Marseille, Toulon and Toulouse also held smaller demonstrations,
though most strikers headed to Paris.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, teachers beat on drums, blew whistles and shouted
slogans demanding the resignation of Education Minister Claude
Allegre as they marched across the Seine River to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Allegre is the chief target of demonstrators, who are opposed to
his education reform plans.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers, as well as parents, also want funds to hire more
teachers and say that an extra $148 million for education that
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin promised last week is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   A March 16 teachers' protest drew hundreds of thousands of
teachers, parents and students into the streets of French towns,
with some 25,000 marching in Paris.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Latrell Sprewell scored 30 points, including 15
in the third quarter, to lead the New York Knicks to a 95-83
victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Houston added 27 points for the Knicks, who remained a
game behind first-place Miami in the Atlantic Division after the
Heat beat Milwaukee 99-87 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Jason Terry had 17 points to lead Atlanta, which has lost
seven straight on the road, and 13 of 16 overall.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell shot 12-of-23 from the field as New York outscored
Atlanta 26-17 in the third quarter to pull away. New York, which
had lost its previous two meetings with Atlanta this season,
increased a three-point halftime lead to as much as 15 in the
third.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Henderson's jumper pulled Atlanta to 55-53 with 9:50 left
in the third, but New York went on a 16-5 run. After Terry scored
on consecutive Hawks possessions to make it 73-62 with 2:24 left in
the third, Sprewell made a driving layup off a pass from Houston
and a 3-pointer to sandwich a layup by Roshown McLeod. Terry's
layup closed the third period with the Knicks in front 78-66.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks got within eight, 88-80 with 3:47 left in the fourth,
but the Knicks went on a 7-2 run to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks outscored the Hawks 12-6 in the final 4{ minutes of
the first half to take a 52-49 lead into the break. Houston scored
14 first-half points on 6-of-10 shooting, while Jackson had 10 of
his points in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta took a 45-40 lead with 3:59 to go in the second on an
8-footer by LaPhonso Ellis. After a pair of free throws at 3:40 by
Kurt Thomas got the Knicks within three, Houston hit a 13-footer at
2:42 to make it 45-44. Dion Glover gave Atlanta a three-point lead
at 2:28 on a driving layup before Sprewell, Camby and Houston
scored on consecutive possessions to put the Knicks ahead 50-47.
Jackson's 15-footer was match by Houston's jumper before
intermission.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Knicks will go on a five-game West Coast road trip,
beginning Sunday at Portland. New York will play 10 of its last 15
games on the road. ... The Knicks are 31-17 since Patrick Ewing
returned to the lineup. ... New York has won 19 of its last 23 at
home, and eight of its last 10. New York is 6-2 when Sprewell
scores 30 or more points. ... New York is 36-4 when they lead or
are tied going into the fourth quarter. ... Atlanta is 1-4 since
waiving Isaiah Rider on March 17. ... The Hawks are 7-27 on the
road. ... Atlanta's Chris Crawford turned his left ankle midway
through the fourth quarter, and did not return.

<HEADLINE> Devils 8, Islanders 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) -- Patrik Elias and Petr Sykora each had a
career-high four points to help Larry Robinson win his New Jersey
coaching debut as the Devils routed the New York Islanders 8-2
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Elias and Sykora each had two goals and two assists as the
Devils extended their Eastern Conference and Atlantic Division
leads over Philadelphia to four points. The Flyers have a game in
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson replaced Robbie Ftorek, who was fired on Thursday.
Robinson was an assistant coach for the Devils before four years as
the head coach of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Randy McKay, Bobby Holik, Alexander Mogilny and Colin White also
scored for the Devils, who won for just the sixth time in 18 games
(6-10-2).
</P>
<P>
   Martin Brodeur only had to make 19 saves for his league-leading
40th win and, after the game, he flipped the game puck to Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Connolly and Evgeny Korolev scored for the Islanders, which
got 30 saves from Kevin Weekes. The Islanders have lost three
straight home games, and have allowed 20 goals in that stretch -- 16
in the last two games.
</P>
<P>
   Elias and Sykora staked the Devils to a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Sykora started at 8:23 on a slap shot from the top of the left
circle that beat Weekes to the near side. Elias tallied at 11:19
off a give-and-go with Sykora, tipping the puck in.
</P>
<P>
   McKay made it 3-0 on a low-slot tip-in on a power play at 16:15.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Valiquette came in for Weekes at that point, and played 74
seconds without facing a shot before Weekes re-entered.
</P>
<P>
   Holik boosted the Devils' lead to 4-0 with a power-play goal off
a rebound at 5:26 of the second. It was the 39th power-play goal
the Islanders have given up in the middle period this season. The
Islanders have only scored 39 power-play goals.
</P>
<P>
   Elias scored one second after a power play on a tip-in at 8:17.
</P>
<P>
   New York made it 5-1 at 11:17 when Claude Lapointe won a right
circle draw and pushed the puck left to Connolly, who sent a quick
wrist shot between Brodeur's pads.
</P>
<P>
   Sykora scored a short-handed goal at 4:57 of the third. Mogilny
scored his first goal for the Devils, after being acquired last
week, on a snap shot at 11:09. Korolev answered with his first NHL
goal at 12:28. White added a goal at 13:40.

<HEADLINE> Penguins 5, Thrashers 3  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Five players scored for Pittsburgh and Jaromir
Jagr assisted on the clinching goal with 2:35 remaining as the
Penguins solidified their hold on the playoffs with a 5-3 victory
over the Atlanta Thrashers on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh has won three in a row since Jagr returned from leg
problems. The NHL's leading scorer has two goals and five assists
in those games, sealing the victory over Atlanta by setting up
Josef Beranek's 12th goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Skating along the right boards, Jagr threaded a pass through
three players to Beranek on the opposite wing. He fired the puck
past helpless Atlanta goalie Damian Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
   Jagr had a chance to score himself but missed a backhander at an
open net in the final minute.
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins moved three points ahead of Buffalo, which holds
the last playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. Montreal is four
points behind Pittsburgh, which improved to 28-24-5 when Jagr
plays. The Penguins are 4-10-3 without their captain.
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers had two goals waved off and put up one of their
best efforts of the season, firing 38 shots at Jean-Sebastien
Aubin. Still, Atlanta dropped to 3-28-3 in its last 34 games.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes, who stopped a career-high 48 shots in a 1-1 tie with
Montreal on Wednesday, gave up a soft, short-handed goal to Martin
Straka to open the scoring just 1:29 into the game. But the Atlanta
goalie made several acrobatic stops among his 30 saves, including a
baseball-like slide across the crease to turn away a point-blank
shot by Jagr.
</P>
<P>
   After Straka's 18th goal, Robert Lang put the Penguins up 2-0 at
7:44 of the first with his 21st. He was allowed to skate out from
behind the net uncontested and fire the puck past Rhodes through a
screen.
</P>
<P>
   From that point, the teams traded goals with Atlanta in a futile
game of catchup.
</P>
<P>
   Still in the first, Dean Sylvester brought the Thrashers to 2-1
with his 15th goal at 8:24, only to have the Penguins restore their
two-goal margin on Pat Falloon's ninth at 5:57 of the second.
Yannick Tremblay scored the first of two power-play goals by the
Thrashers at 8:09, cutting the deficit to 3-2, but Alexei Kovalev
gave the Penguins some breathing room with his 22nd at 11:16.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, Atlanta's Steve Guolla scored his 10th on a power
play at 7:08 to make it a one-goal game once again.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 18,727, a record at Philips Arena, gave Penguins
owner Mario Lemieux a standing ovation when he was shown on the
video board during the second period.

<HEADLINE> Timberwolves 116, Nets 115, OT  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Kevin Garnett scored 38 points and
Malik Sealy put in a rebound with 38.8 seconds left in overtime to
lead the Minnesota Timberwolves to a 116-115 victory over the New
Jersey Nets on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The win was Minnesota's fifth straight and 14th in 17 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets complained about two officiating decisions in the
closing seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett made 1 of 2 free throws to tie the game at 108 with 2.2
seconds left in regulation after Scott Burrell was called for a
holding foul under the basket on a play in which Minnesota
inbounded the ball near midcourt.
</P>
<P>
   The other call -- or non-call -- came with 32.1 seconds left in
overtime, when Keith Van Horn beat Garnett on a drive to the
basket. Garnett turned his back and Van Horn ran into him and
somehow had his shot blocked.
</P>
<P>
   On the ensuing inbounds play, Terrell Brandon stole a Kendall
Gill pass and the Timberwolves ran out the clock after Wally
Szczerbiak got an offensive rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Nets coach Don Casey went to midcourt to yell at officials Don
Vaden, Bill Spooner and Derek Richardson after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett hit 15 of 24 shots in falling two points shy of his
career high, which he had Wednesday against Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Sealy and Joe Smith added 17 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Kittles and Stephon Marbury each had 27 points for New
Jersey, while Van Horn added 17.
</P>
<P>
   There were six lead changes in the final minute of regulation,
including two in the final 7.7 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota took a 107-106 lead when Sealy converted two free
throws. Marbury was whistled for his sixth foul, though replays
showed Van Horn hit Sealy across the arms.
</P>
<P>
   Lucious Harris, who replaced Marbury, put New Jersey back in
front 108-107, tipping in a missed floater by Kittles with 2.2
seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the foul call on the inbounds pass, sending Garnett to
the line. He missed the first badly but converted the second to
force overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota, which led almost from the start, appeared to be in
control with 5:33 to play when Sealy capped an 8-2 spurt with three
free throws to give the Timberwolves a 95-87 lead.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey came right back and scored the next 10 points with
Marbury hitting two free throws with 3:01 to play for a 97-95 lead.
Notes: Nets starting center Jim McIlvaine left the game with 5:14
left in the first quarter and did not return. ... The Timberwolves
were credited with an assist on each of their 15 baskets in the
first quarter. Brandon collected eight of those assists. ... The
win was the 20th on the road for Minnesota, a frachise record. ...
The Timberwolves are 19-9 in games decided by six points or less.
They were 7-7 in such contests last season. ... The loss was only
the Nets' sixth in their last 25 home games.

Source: Microsoft Tries To Settle
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Microsoft Corp. faxed a detailed proposal to
government lawyers today to settle its landmark antitrust case after the trial
judge warned he will deliver his verdict Tuesday absent progress in secret
settlement talks in Chicago, people close to the case said. The government has
alleged that Microsoft illegally bundled its own Internet browser software with
Windows to compete with popular rival software from the former Netscape
Communications Corp. Lawyers for Microsoft, the Justice Department and the 19
states in the case declined to speak publicly about the settlement offer.

Study: U.S. Military Homophobia Common
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Pentagon inspector general's survey released today says
anti-gay speech and harassment is common in the U.S. military. Eighty-five
percent of those surveyed said they believed that anti-gay comments are
tolerated on their base or aboard their ship, and 37 percent said they had
personally witnessed or been the target of harassment. Defense Secretary William
Cohen, responding to the inspector general's survey results, announced he was
creating a committee of military and civilian officials to draft a plan for
measures to improve the Clinton administration's so-called ''don't ask, don't
tell'' policy on gays.

Clinton Urging Peace in South Asia
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BOMBAY, India (AP) -- Concerned about terrorism, security is tight as
President Clinton visits Pakistan on Saturday to urge a retreat from nuclear
weapons and a lowering of dangerous tensions with India. The president will
spend just five hours in Pakistan -- after spending five days in India -- a sign
of U.S. unhappiness about Gen. Pervez Musharraf's October coup and his refusal
to set a timetable for national elections and a return to democracy. For its
part, India rejected Clinton's plea to sign a nuclear test ban. The same outcome
is likely in Pakistan, at least in the immediate future, White House officials
believe.

demanding an international tribunal to investigate and prosecute American
soldiers. In a rare press conference, North Korean Ambassador Li Hyong Chol
accused U.S. troops of carrying out massacres, indiscriminate bombings, germ
warfare and torture that resulted in the deaths of 1 million North Koreans. U.S.
officials have dismissed most of the North Korean claims as propaganda.

Former Iran Hostage Awarded $341M

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Terry Anderson was awarded $341 million from Iran today by
a federal judge who said his treatment during his nearly seven years of
captivity in Beirut was ''savage and cruel by any civilized standards.''
Anderson, the former chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press,
was the longest-held U.S. hostage. Anderson's case was the latest to come to
trial under a 1996 law that allows Americans who are victims of terrorism in
foreign countries to sue in U.S. courts if the State Department lists those
nations as sponsors of terrorism. U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
wrote ''the likelihood that any award will ever be paid is minimal.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Under threat of a strike, negotiators for US Airways and

contract issues were settled in talks overseen by the National Mediation Board
in Washington this week, but pay and pensions remained big sticking points,
Association of Flight Attendants' president Pat Friend said. Unless negotiators
can resolve a three-year contract dispute, the airline faced a possible 12:01

<HEADLINE> Fujimori Opposition Gains in Poll  </HEADLINE>
By RICK VECCHIO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- A challenger to President Alberto Fujimori in
April elections is gaining support, moving into second place behind
the Peruvian leader, according to a poll released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Economist Alejandro Toledo has the backing of 27 percent of
respondents, according to the survey by the private firm Apoyo.
Toledo had just 10 percent support in polling a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori led all contenders with 37 percent support, according
to the survey, which had a margin of error of 2.5 percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   If the poll results are reflected in the April 9 balloting,
Fujimori would not win an outright majority and be forced into a
runoff between the other top vote-getter.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point the most probable scenario is that Peru will
have a second round vote between Fujimori and Toledo,'' said
Apoyo's director, Alfredo Torres, adding that the poll indicates a
runoff result of Toledo with 44 percent and Fujimori with 43
percent, a statistical dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   The other two candidates are Lima Mayor Alberto Andrade and
former social security director Luis Castaneda.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's unprecedented third-term re-election bid has been
tainted by allegations of election fraud and accusations that his
government has waged a campaign of intimidation and dirty tricks to
discredit his opponents. Fujimori's government has denied the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   A joint mission of the U.S.-based National Democratic Institute
and Carter Center on Friday said that ''conditions for a fair
election campaign have not been established.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Irreparable damage to the integrity of the election process
has already been done, but improvements still can be made because
candidates and parties are competing, citizens are participating in
the process and the electoral outcomes are not assured,'' the
delegation's report said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate response Friday from Fujimori or his
government to the NDI-Carter Center findings.
</P>
<P>
   Apoyo surveyed 1,812 Peruvians across the Andean nation of 25
million people.
</P>
<P>
   With little more than two weeks before the vote, Toledo's suurge
evokes memories of Fujimori's rise a decade ago, when the
then-university rector surged from 3 percent a month before the
election and staged an upset victory.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo, who finished fourth in Fujimori's 1995 landslide
re-election victory, has emphasized his humble beginnings as a
farmer's son who shined shoes to help make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to hold three graduate degrees, including a doctorate
in economics from Stanford University, and was an adviser to the
World Bank.

<HEADLINE> Carter To Play on U.S. Olympic Team  </HEADLINE>
By HAL BOCK, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   All USA Basketball had to do was ask.
</P>
<P>
   Vince Carter decided on Friday to accept an invitation to
replace injured Tom Gugliotta on U.S. Olympic team for the Sydney
Games.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's going,'' Dave Haggith, a spokesman for the NBA Toronto
Raptors, said. ''It's just a matter of dotting the i's and crossing
the t's. It doesn't become official until two days from now.''
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call Thursday, the selection committee decided
unanimously to offer the spot to Carter after Gugliotta was forced
to withdraw because of reconstructive knee surgery. Carter received
the invitation Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Miller, spokesman for USA Basketball, said a contract and
other forms were being forwarded to the player selected by the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''This takes more than a day. We anticipate an announcement
early next week,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Carter was angered in January when USA Basketball passed him
over in favor of Ray Allen of the Milwaukee Bucks.
</P>
<P>
   After the snub, Carter went on a tear. He was the leading
vote-getter for the All-Star game and won the slam dunk
competition. Then he scored 51 points in Toronto's first appearance
on network television, nearly had a triple double in a game in New
York and won two games in a week with 3-point buzzer-beaters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Vince really earned it. They said he wasn't good enough,''
Toronto coach Butch Carter said. ''When I talked to him about what
it's going to feel like when he walks into the Olympic stadium
during opening ceremonies, it brought a huge smile to his face.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the January snub, the opportunity to represent his
country was too much to pass up. Carter had planned on finishing up
his degree this summer at the University of North Carolina, but
he'll likely have to put those plans on hold.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's had to do a lot of rescheduling, so its something that's
important to him,'' Haggith said. ''He's just trying to shuffle
some things around, summer school and things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter said talk of him making the Olympics has distracted him
lately.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's tough to stay focused when people are putting emphasis on
the wrong things,'' said Carter, who scored just 18 points on
4-for-16 shooting in a loss to Charlotte on Friday. ''I can't think
about it now. I'll worry about it when the season is over. I have
enough problems with trying to win games and reach 40 wins. Sooner
or later this will be over and I'll just worry about the Raptors.''
</P>
<P>
   The paperwork will be handled by his mother. She is taking care
of Carter's business affairs after he split with agent William
''Tank'' Black. The agent is being sued by the Securities and
Exchange Commission for violating securities laws.
</P>
<P>
   Other members of the USA Basketball team are Allen, Alonzo
Mourning, Grant Hill, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Gary Payton, Tim
Hardaway, Steve Smith, Allan Houston, Vin Baker and Jason Kidd.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd broke his ankle this week but is expected to recover in
time for the start of the Olympic practices.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Olympic Committee must submit its final roster for
Sydney by Aug. 25.

<HEADLINE> New Dealine Set for Elian Relatives  </HEADLINE>
By MILDRADE CHERFILS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The federal government issued a new ultimatum to
Elian Gonzalez's Florida relatives Friday, telling them they have
until noon Monday to agree to a speedy appeals process -- or the boy
will be returned to Cuba, the family spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Gutierrez said family members will meet with their
lawyer over the weekend to discuss the case. Beoynd that, Gutierrez
said: ''We will not comment right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The had issued an ultimatum on Thursday to the relatives: agree
to a speedy timetable for their appeal of a federal court decision
against them or the agency would ''immediately move to revoke''
Elian's status in this country.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a federal official close to the case confirmed
that the new conditions from the Justice Department give the
family's lawyers until April 3 to file an expedited appeal. The
previous deadline had been March 31.
</P>
<P>
   However, if the boy's relatives do not agree to the new
deadline, the federal government will begin the process of
returning Elian to his father in Cuba on March 30, according to the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials dealing with the case and Elian's family and
their attorneys were to meet on Tuesday -- only if the family
rejects the April 3 deadline -- to discuss ''the return of Elian to
his father,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno confirmed a new dealine and repeated
that ''our goal is to reunite Elian with his father in a fair,
prompt and orderly manner. ...
</P>
<P>
   ''As of this moment , (the boy's Miami relatives) have not
agreed to comply with these terms.,'' Reno said in a statement
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will continue to try to reach an agreement with Elian's
Miami relatives ...'' she concluded, offering no details of the
Monday deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, lawyers for the boy's Miami relatives had
proposed the appointment of an independent arbitrator to determine
if sending Elian back to Cuba or allowing him to stay here would be
better for the child. Attorneys for the Florida relatives said an
arbitration process could begin April 3 and be completed within two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But Doris Meissner, commissioner of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not an option that we are prepared to entertain,'' she
said. ''Our goal here is to reunite Elian with his father and to do
that as quickly, as promptly and as orderly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The ultimatums came in the wake of a federal judge's decision
this week affirming the U.S. government's decision to send the
6-year-old back to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   In the proposal to the INS, attorney Kendall Coffey said the
boy's relatives had offered to abide by an arbitrator's decision.
Coffey suggested former Sen. Bob Dole or Sen. George Mitchell for
the position.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the INS would agree at last to provide a day in court to
this small child, the result would be not only a fair determination
of what's right for Elian, but a much faster resolution than is
possible through further court battles,'' Coffey wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating the denial by INS officials, Coffey said the
family's appeal of the federal court ruling would be filed by April
3.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, journalists and other observers criticized the
arbitration offer, saying it was another attempt to draw out the
boy's U.S. stay. During a live roundtable program broadcast by
Cuban state television, panel members also said they were
disappointed the boy's time in the United States could now be
extended for at least three more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was found clinging to an inner tube off Florida on Nov.
25. His mother and 10 other people drowned when their boat capsized
during an attempt to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The case quickly became a tug-of-war between the Cuban
government and U.S. family members who oppose the Cuban
government's Communist ideology and want to raise the boy.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Matt Geiger's layup with 40 seconds left in
the second overtime lifted the Philadelphia 76ers to a 117-115
victory over the Boston Celtics Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Sixers' fifth straight win, their longest streak of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Iverson and Eric Snow each 21 points for Philadelphia,
Toni Kukoc added 20 points and 13 rebounds, and Tyrone Hill had 19
points and 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Pierce, who exchanged heated words with fans behind the
Boston bench in the fourth period, scored 31 points before fouling
out. Antoine Walker added 24 points and 14 rebounds, and Vitaly
Potapenko had a career-high 18 rebounds for the Celtics, who have
lost three in a row.
</P>
<P>
   After Geiger grabbed an offensive rebound and scored to snap a
115-115 score, Dana Barros, Walker and Potapenko all missed for the
Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   A three-point play by Iverson put Philadelphia up 114-113 with
2:41 left in the second overtime. The Celtics failed to score on
their next possession, despite getting three offensive rebounds.
Kevin Ollie's free throw made it 115-113 with 1:15 remaining before
Adrian Griffin's layup tied the score.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce hit a 19-foot jumper with 1.7 seconds left in the first
overtime to put Boston in front 107-105, but Aaron McKie's
18-footer at the buzzer sent the game into the second extra
session.
</P>
<P>
   Theo Ratliff's layup with 18 seconds remaining in regulation
tied the game at 97. Pierce missed a jumper with 0.9 seconds left
and the game went to overtime.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Philadelphia signed head coach Larry Brown to a new
multiyear contract prior to the game. Last season, Brown, who is
now in his third season with Philadelphia, led the Sixers to their
first playoff berth since 1990-91. ...The 76ers placed starting
forward George Lynch on the injured list with a sprained right
medial collateral ligament and signed Antonio Lang to a 10-day
contract to fill the roster spot. Kukoc took Lynch's spot in the
starting lineup, making his first start as a Sixer. Lynch had been
the only player on the team to start every game this season. ...The
Celtics did not attempt a free throw in the first half.

<HEADLINE> Wal-Mart Hit With $50M Judgment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEXARKANA, Ark. (AP) -- A jury ordered Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to
pay $50 million to a company that claimed the giant retailer stole
trade secrets when the two negotiated on development of a credit
system.
</P>
<P>
   ''They did wrong. I negotiated with these people for a long
time,'' said Joe O'Banion, chief executive of Texas-based P.O.
Market Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The company was working with the retailing giant to develop a
credit system for Sam's Club. Sam's Direct was later put into place
but as a collaboration between Wal-Mart and General Electric
Capital Corp., using what O'Banion called the ''O'Banion Concept.''
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart plans to appeal Thursday's verdict, said the company's
lawyer, Peter Cumbe. Wal-Mart argued during the nine-day trial that
information it may have used was not confidential and was not a
trade secret.
</P>
<P>
   The jury awarded P.O. Market $31.7 million plus seven years
interest, for a total of about $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just wanted it to be heard,'' O'Banion said of his case
after the verdict.

<HEADLINE> Bulls 70, Nuggets 68  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Hersey Hawkins got all six of his points in the
final two minutes, including two free throws with eight seconds
left Friday night, as the Chicago Bulls beat the Denver Nuggets
70-68 to end an eight-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Van Exel missed a 3-pointer to win just before the buzzer
and the 33-year-old Hawkins hit the floor to cover the ball as
Chicago won for just the second time in 18 games.
</P>
<P>
   Denver had its second-lowest scoring game of the season -- 67 is
its low -- and has lost 13 of 15.
</P>
<P>
   Elton Brand led the Bulls with 26 points and 15 rebounds and
Chicago won despite shooting just 30 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Keon Clark paced the Nuggets, who shot 33 percent, with 18
points and 10 rebounds. Raef LaFrentz had 15 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins' floater through the lane gave the Bulls a 68-66 lead
with 1:24 left. Fred Hoiberg then stole a pass with 1:10 left. But
after Brand missed, Clark followed his own miss with 28 seconds
left for a 68-68 tie.
</P>
<P>
   After a timeout, the Bulls tried to set up a final shot, but
Hawkins slipped down in the lane and a foul was called. He made
both free throws to give the Bulls a two-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   Brand had 20 first-half points, including the Bulls' first 13 in
the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The game was tied after the first quarter, at the half and after
three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Fred Hoiberg returned after missing three games with a
concussion, the result of a collision last Friday against Golden
State. Hoiberg took another blow when he drove through the lane for
a dunk and was hit in the nose by Chris Gatling's arm. ... The
Bulls, averaging almost 19 turnovers a game, had 12. The Nuggets
committed 24.. ... The Nuggets have lost nine straight on the road
and are 10-90 away from home the last three seasons.

<HEADLINE> Plane Lands Safely on N.Y. Thruway  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANAJOHARIE, N.Y. (AP) -- A single-engine plane carrying three
passengers made a safe emergency landing on the state Thruway
during rush hour Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The four-seat Cessna 172 Skyhawk touched down shortly after 5
p.m. in the westbound passing lane, state Thruway police
Investigator Jerri Stover said.
</P>
<P>
   ''To see this with no injuries is pretty remarkable,'' he told
the Utica Observer-Dispatch.
</P>
<P>
   Several cars were in the other lanes as the plane descended. No
damage was done to the plane or to any vehicles. The plane did not
even hit the guardrail.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was forced to land because it lost oil pressure to the
engine after taking off from the Cortland County Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, Jason Ingram, 24, of Penn Yan, turned the engine off
to avoid a fire and looked for a place to land, Stover said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane remained in the lane until it was towed away at about
8:30 p.m.

<HEADLINE> Ohio Man Shoots Wife, Injures Inlaw  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKLIN, Ohio (AP) -- A man fatally shot his wife and wounded
her brother Friday inside a factory where the three worked, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael D. Pardon, who had been arguing with his wife in the
parking lot of Digitron Co., followed her into the machine shop
when she went in to report for work, said police Capt. Gerry
Massey.
</P>
<P>
   Pardon, 26, opened fire with a semi-automatic handgun, wounding
his wife and her brother, Massey said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He traveled to another part of the building, still firing,''
said Massey. ''He was subdued by other employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Pardon's wife, Shirley Pardon, 39, was shot in the face and died
Friday, police said. Her brother, James D. Allen, 38, was in fair
condition with a gunshot wound to the leg, a hospital spokeswoman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pardon was arrested on charges of aggravated murder, attempted
murder and aggravated assault, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting occurred about 5:30 p.m. at the machine shop that
supplies parts to the auto industry. A recording at the company
Friday night said the offices were closed.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin is about 25 miles south of Dayton.

<HEADLINE> Judge To Limit Reno Waco Deposition  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE MITTELSTADT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge on Friday granted the Justice
Department's request to limit the duration of questioning that
Attorney General Janet Reno will face next week from lawyers for
Branch Davidians who are suing the government over the 1993 Waco
siege.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief order, U.S. District Judge Walter Smith of Waco said
the Justice Department's request, filed a day earlier, ''has merit
and should be granted.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge, who is presiding over the Davidians' wrongful-death
civil suit, accepted the government's bid to limit Reno's
deposition Tuesday in Washington to two hours.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking the time limit, the Justice Department noted the
''heavy demands'' of Reno's job and said two hours would provide
''ample opportunity'' for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs' lead counsel, Michael Caddell, agreed to the
time limitation. But a second Davidian lawyer, Jim Brannon,
rejected the request, describing it as ''wholly unreasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You just don't tell a lawyer that he cannot cross-examine a
witness,'' Brannon said Thursday. ''Not if you're seeking
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached Friday, after the plaintiffs' deposition of former FBI
Director William Sessions in San Antonio, Brannon expressed little
surprise at Smith's order.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing I have to say is that I disagree with that
ruling and I don't believe that people should be limited in such an
important case on such important matters,'' he said. ''But I will,
of course, abide by the judge's order.''
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs, whose case goes to trial in mid-May, want to
question Reno about her approval of the FBI's tear-gassing plan and
final assault. The Davidians' retreat erupted in flames several
hours into the tear-gas operation, during which tanks tore into the
compound.
</P>
<P>
   Davidian leader David Koresh and some 80 followers died during
that April 19, 1993 inferno, some from the fire, others from
gunshot wounds. The government has long insisted the Davidians died
by their own hand.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs contend that the FBI's on-scene commanders
deviated from the Reno-approved final assault plan -- escalating the
tear-gassing and building destruction in ways not okayed by her.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers also want to question her about any firefighting
planning that occurred prior to the 19th.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier depositions, the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team leader
Richard Rogers and on-scene commander Jeffrey Jamar, have offered
differing assessments as to whether a firefighting plan existed,
Brannon said.
</P>
<P>
   Jamar told Congress in 1995 that he held firetrucks back from
the blaze that ended the 51-day standoff for fear firefighters
might be shot.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, both sides filed a joint motion asking Smith to
give them access to the actual recordings from last Sunday's
court-ordered field test at Fort Hood because the digitally
computerized copies of the test data they were given are too poor
for valid scientific analysis, The Dallas Morning News reported for
Saturday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides complained about the quality of the tape they were
given within 24 hours of the completion of the simulation, which
was designed to determine whether federal agents fired at Branch
Davidians during the final moments of the April 1993 standoff.

<HEADLINE> Stars 5, Blackhawks 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Mike Modano scored the tie-breaking goal with
11:43 to play as the Dallas Stars extended their unbeaten streak to
six games with a 5-1 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks on Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Modano snapped the 1-1 deadlock with his 35th goal while the
Stars were on a power play, snapping Brenden Morrow's goal-mouth
pass past Blackhawks goalie Jocelyn Thibault.
</P>
<P>
   Modano has 19 goals and 22 assists in his last 28 games.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Nieuwendyk tapped a loose puck into an open net for his 13th
goal with 11:16 left to extend Dallas' lead to 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Langenbrunner and Mike Keane scored empty-net short-handed
goals in the final 1:10 for the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Keane added a second-period goal and Ed Belfour made 17
saves for Dallas, 5-0-1 in its last six games.
</P>
<P>
   Michal Grosek scored a first-period goal for the Blackhawks, who
had their season-long six-game unbeaten streak (5-0-1) come to an
end.
</P>
<P>
   Grosek scored his 13th goal at 18:01 on a rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas tied it at 1 at 13:50 of the second when Keane knocked
the rebound of Roman Lyashenko's shot past goalie Jocelyn Thibault
for Keane's 10th goal.
</P>
<P>
   Stars left wing Scott Thornton began serving a three-game
suspension on Friday night. Thornton received a match penalty for
high-sticking late in a game against San Jose on March 19.
</P>
<P>
   Center Guy Carbonneau returned to the Dallas lineup after
missing seven games because of a fractured wrist.

<HEADLINE> Judge: Talk Show Jury Award Stands  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- A judge on Friday let stand a $25 million
jury verdict that found ''The Jenny Jones Show'' negligent in the
slaying of a guest killed after he revealed a gay crush on another
guest.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit Judge Gene Schnelz rejected an attempt by attorneys for
Warner Bros. and Telepictures, the show's distributors, to throw
out the verdict, reduce the award or grant a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   An Oakland County jury last May held the show and its corporate
owner, Warner Bros., liable in the shooting death of Scott Amedure,
who had revealed his attraction to Jonathan Schmitz during a 1995
taping of the program. Amedure was shot dead three days later.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether they like it or not, each side received a trial of its
own making and neither has any cause to complain,'' Schnelz ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys Ven Johnson and Geoffrey Fieger represented the
Amedure family in its wrongful death lawsuit against the show. The
Amedures sued the talk show in 1995, contending that Schmitz was
ambushed and tricked into believing his secret admirer was a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney James Feeney, who represented Warner Bros., said he was
disappointed but not surprised by the ruling, which will be
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I continue to remain very optimistic,'' Feeney said. ''The
court's decision doesn't change our view on the law in Michigan.
We're going to present all of those views to the Court of Appeals.
The case should never have been sent to a jury in the first
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Telepictures also said it would appeal the decision.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Topples Duke in East Regional  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NICHOLSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Florida knocked off the top seed of them all, leaving the
unpredictable NCAA tournament even more wide open.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Nelson scored 15 points and the Gators scored the final 13
points to beat Duke 87-78 on Friday night in the East Regional
semifinals in Syracuse, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Duke's loss left the tournament with only one remaining top
seed, Michigan State in the Midwest Regional. Arizona was knocked
out in the second round in the West, and Stanford was eliminated in
the second round in the South.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has been as gratifying of a year as I've ever had,'' Duke
coach Mike Krzyzewski said. ''The loss to Florida isn't going to
change that. If you expect me to feel bad, you're crazy. What a
journey my kids have given me this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke (29-5), ranked No. 1 in the final AP poll, had won 26
straight games in the East since 1986 and was 21-3 as the top seed.
The fifth-seeded Gators (27-7) will play the Seton Hall-Oklahoma
State winner for a spot in the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're really excited,'' said Nelson, who hit three 3-pointers
and had four assists and only one turnover. ''Duke was the No. 1
team in the country. To beat Duke is a great feeling. But we have
to focus because we want to reach the mountaintop. We have a few
more games to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the South Regional in Austin, Texas, seventh-seeded Tulsa
beat sixth-seeded Miami 80-71. North Carolina faced Tennessee in
the second game.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Michigan State will play Iowa State in the Midwest
final in Auburn Hills, Mich., and Purdue will face Wisconsin in an
all-Big Ten West final in Albuquerque, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Duke failed to advance to the Final Four for the fourth time in
the last five years after making six appearances and winning two
titles in a seven-year stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils were 3-for-19 from 3-point range after going
2-for-17 against Kansas in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Battier led Duke with 20 points, 15 in the second half.
Chris Carrawell finished with 16 and freshman point guard Jason
Williams added 13 on 6-of-20 shooting, 1-for-9 from beyond the arc.
</P>
<P>
   Duke, which went five minutes without a basket in the first
half, went cold again when the game was on the line, missing six 3s
and not getting a basket for the final 4:45.
</P>
<P>
   Duke seemed set to take control after Williams hit a 3-pointer
with 6:37 left for a 73-66 lead. But Nelson hit a 3 for Florida and
Teddy Dupay's three-point play tied it for the 12th time, 74-74,
with 4:45 left.
</P>
<P>
   Another 3 by Dupay and a basket by Brent Wright gave the Gators
the lead for good, 79-78 with 2:08 to go.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a huge win confidence-wise,'' said Udonis Haslem, who had
13 points for the Gators. ''But at the same time, we came here to
win two games, and we've only won one.''
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa (32-4) advanced to its first regional final.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon Kurtz scored all 17 of his points in the second half and
Eric Coley also had 17 points for Tulsa, which was playing in the
round of 16 for the third time since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Vernon Jennings and Mario Bland each scored 17 points for Miami
(23-11), which fell one victory short of a school record.

<HEADLINE> Tight Security in Pakistan Capital  </HEADLINE>
By KATHY GANNON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Soldiers stood guard on most street
corners, army helicopters buzzed low overhead and jeeps mounted
with machine guns patrolled tree-lined streets on the eve of
President Clinton's visit to Pakistan's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Along Clinton's route, soldiers combed the grass with dogs
sniffing for explosives. Troops roamed with hand-held mine
detectors. An estimated 5,000 soldiers and thousands of police were
deployed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is to hold two meetings with Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who
seized power in a bloodless military coup in October, as well as
participate in a working lunch before making a television address
to the Pakistani nation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton does not venture anywhere abroad without heavy
protection but security in his South Asian travels has been
extraordinary. A major reason for that is terrorism, a topic on the
day's agenda and an elevated concern throughout his travels on the
subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of his regular baby blue and white jet with ''United
States'' in large letters on its side, Clinton took an unmarked
plane from Bombay to Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton canceled a helicopter visit to a Bangladeshi village at
the start of his trip because of the possible dangers. According to
published reports, U.S. officials believe groups linked to accused
terrorist Osama bin Laden, or bin Laden himself, may have plotted
attacks on Clinton during the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan, meanwhile, is headquarters to militant Muslim groups
fighting in Indian-ruled Kashmir. In Afghanistan, next door to
Pakistan, bin Laden has been given refuge by the hardline Taliban
militia.
</P>
<P>
   In November, six rockets were fired in a two-minute volley at
several different locations in Islamabad in a synchronized attack
on the U.S. Embassy, an American cultural center and U.N. offices.
</P>
<P>
   The missiles missed the embassy and did no damage to the U.N.
facility, but a rocket went through a window at the American Center
and into a desk.
</P>
<P>
   No one has been caught.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence sources believe the attacks were linked to
U.N. sanctions against Afghanistan, imposed to press a demand to
hand over bin Laden for trial on terrorism charges either in the
United States or a third country. The Taliban have flatly refused.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would like Pakistan to shut down some of the militant
groups here. Pakistani officials have refused, but ordered the
groups to keep a low profile, banned rallies and outlawed the
public display of weapons during and after Clinton's visit.
