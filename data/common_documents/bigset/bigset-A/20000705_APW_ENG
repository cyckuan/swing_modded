<HEADLINE> N.Y teacher's starting, average salaries third-best in U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - New York's average teachers' salary is
third-best in the nation and more than 22 percent over the national
average, according to figures compiled by the American Federation
of Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   New York's average teacher salary of $49,686 a year trailed only
New Jersey ($51,692) and Connecticut ($50,277) during the 1998-99
school year, according to American Federation of Teachers
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The national teacher salary average for that school year was
$40,574, the AFT said.
</P>
<P>
   New York was also third in terms of average starting teacher
salary in 1998-99 at $30,808, trailing Alaska ($32,884) and
Connecticut ($31,391). The national average there was $26,639.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics were released Wednesday as part of the AFT's
annual convention in Philadelphia. New York's largest teachers'
union, New York State United Teachers, is affiliated with the AFT.
</P>
<P>
   New York State United Teachers has warned about an impending
shortage of teachers in New York, blaming teacher salaries in the
state in part, and detailed the dissatisfaction of many educators
with their paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   In a March survey, 62 percent of New York State United Teachers'
members polled disagreed with the statement, ''I feel that I am
paid fairly for the work I do as a teacher.'' Among New York City
teachers, 86 percent disagreed with the statement.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the AFT, New Yorker Sandra Feldman, said the
national figures in her union's survey indicate that what she
called low teacher salaries nationwide are threatening to thwart
the attainment of higher academic standards.
</P>
<P>
   The AFT said the average annual starting salary for teachers in
1999 badly trailed those for other new college graduates such as in
engineering ($44,362), computer sciences ($42,500) and
economics-finance ($38,234).
</P>
<P>
   ''New college graduates as well as seasoned teachers are being
lured to other professions with handsome salary offers while the
teaching profession often isn't even in the horse race,'' Feldman
said.
</P>
<P>
   That was one way of looking at the numbers. But a group
representing the teachers' employers in New York, the state School
Boards Association, interpreted the state's No. 3 finishes in both
average salary and starting salary as a sign ''New York is paying
competitive salaries in comparison with other states,'' school
boards spokesman David Ernst said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think teachers are rewarded amply in New York and we're
getting a good supply of teachers,'' Ernst said. ''We are getting a
lot of good people coming into the teaching ranks.''
</P>
<P>
   While there are ''spot'' shortages of teachers in some areas and
in some subjects like mathematics and science, Ernst said ''there
is no general shortage of teachers'' in New York.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the state Legislature has channeled unprecedented
sums of education aid to schools in recent years - a record $1.2
billion increase in the current fiscal year alone - helping to
account for New York's higher-than-average pay for teachers.
</P>
<P>
   For a generation, he said, school districts have tended to
increase the pay scales for middle- and high-salaried teachers
higher than for beginning teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both unions and school boards have to pay attention to that,''
Ernst said. ''There is a finite amount of money. You've got to
decide, where does the new money absolutely need to go? I think
there is a valid argument that can be made that starting salaries
need to be higher in certain areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the 100 largest cities nationally, Yonkers ($37,045) had
the highest starting teachers' salary in the United States for
school year 1998-99, according to the American Federation of
Teachers' data. Rochester ($31,500) was 15th, New York City
($30,265) was 23rd and Buffalo ($28,563) was 36th.

<HEADLINE> City seeking to maximize tourism clings to gangster's tale  </HEADLINE>
AP Photo
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Trying to snatch a tourism opportunity
before it's stolen by time, one community hopes to make a hit with
its once-famous gangster.
</P>
<P>
   Seven decades ago in the days of Prohibition and speakeasies,
Jack ''Legs'' Diamond was a ruthless and colorful gangster with a
national reputation. The flashy gangster enjoyed a notoriety
similar to that of organized crime boss John Gotti - New York
City's ''Dapper Don'' - today. But Diamond was Albany's own, said
Herb Holland, who will lead the offbeat tour July 19.
</P>
<P>
   And Albany wants to make sure he stays that way.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of the adults, particularly if they're middle-aged and
older, will know Legs Diamond,'' said Holland, a retired educator.
But, he adds, ''As time goes on, the number of people who know of
him will become fewer and fewer.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He did things that fascinated people,'' Holland told The Daily
Gazette of Schenectady. Diamond was ''a very cruel guy ... He
thought nothing of killing people who got in his way.'' His way was
to run alcohol illegally through the Catskills and much of New York
state.
</P>
<P>
   The tour comes at a time when tourism is hot for criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The just-released book ''Crime Scene USA'' is a guide to murder
and mayhem in every state. More than 150 crime scenes are listed
including the scenes of assassinations of President Kennedy, John
Lennon and Martin Luther King Jr., the homes of JonBenet Ramsey and
Nicole Brown Simpson, and the sites of Wild West hangouts and
holdups of outlaw Jesse James.
</P>
<P>
   Now Albany, the one-time home to historical figures including
presidents Martin Van Buren, Grover Cleveland, Theodore Roosevelt
and Franklin D. Roosevelt, is hoping Diamond is yet another draw
for history-minded tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here we had a nationally known crime figure who actually
operated in and around Albany to say nothing of being killed
here,'' Holland said.
</P>
<P>
   That death is a big part of the story - and the tour.
</P>
<P>
   Among the attractions is the site of the speakeasy where Diamond
celebrated his acquittal on kidnapping charges on the night of his
death by a gunman. Now it's a state office building. The hotel
ballroom where Diamond hung out is no longer around, either. The
once glamorous Kenmore Hotel is now used for office space. And the
two-story brick row building where Diamond spent his final hours is
still there, although it is now a private home, not a rooming
house.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 19, 1931, hundreds of people gathered outside the
rooming house after news spread that Diamond had been shot dead
there.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a national celebrity that got killed, that got
murdered,'' Holland said.
</P>
<P>
   Diamond's killer was never captured.

<HEADLINE> Towers going up at medium-security prisons around state  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Hastened in part by a 1997 melee, the state
is erecting observation towers at 27 medium-security state prisons
as a means of keeping a better eye on inmates and prison grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of the 31-foot-high towers are already in place and plans
call for 31 in all to be installed within the next year.
Twenty-seven of the towers will be built by the prison system's
inmate construction business called Corcraft and four have been
done by outside contractors.
</P>
<P>
   It will cost about $2.5 million to erect the towers, according
to state prison estimates.
</P>
<P>
   State Corrections Commissioner Glenn Goord said the towers will
make things safer for both inmates and prison staff.
</P>
<P>
   All maximum-security prisons in the state already have
surveillance towers, and Goord said an incident this year at Attica
showed their value.
</P>
<P>
   On April 17, a tower guard saw a group of about six Hispanic
inmates approach a similar number of black inmates who were lifting
weights. The guard saw one of the black inmates take out what
looked like a knife and the corrections officer radioed to the four
officers in the yard at the time, who moved in to disarm the inmate
and prevent what could have developed into a melee.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was the officer in the tower who saw an incident developing
before the officers in the yard did,'' prison system spokesman
James Flateau said.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials have been thinking for years of bolstering
security with the towers, since the early 1990s when it was
becoming clear that possible security flaws were developing at
medium-security prisons built primarily during the Cuomo
administration, Flateau said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those mediums, what we call the 'cookie-cutters,' they were
originally designed for 500 inmates,'' Flateau said. ''Then it
became 750. Then we double-bunked them. Then we added annexes. They
have ended up housing a considerably larger number than they were
originally designed for.''
</P>
<P>
   The July 18, 1997, disturbance at an outside yard at the
sprawling Mohawk prison near Utica reinforced the need for the
towers, Flateau said. Ten guards were injured during an incident
which began as a fight among inmates and escalated to a disturbance
involving 300 prisoners in an outside yard.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 corrections officers were called in to help quell
the disturbance.
</P>
<P>
   The melee prompted a review of security procedures at all
medium-security state prisons, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mohawk simply reaffirmed that we needed them (the towers) and
we should have them in place as soon as possible,'' Flateau said.
</P>
<P>
   Guards in all surveillance towers in state prisons are armed,
Flateau said.
</P>
<P>
   Towers are already in place at the following medium-security
state prisons: Marcy, Orleans, Livingston, Cape Vincent, Riverview,
Gouverneur, Watertown, Gowanda and Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next year, they will either be completed or constructed
at Mohawk, Oneida, Cayuga, Altona, Mount McGregor, Washington,
Ulster, Mid-Orange, Otisville, Taconic, Woodbourne, Groveland,
Mid-State, Ogdensburg, Fishkill, Adirondack, Lakeview and Albion.
</P>
<P>
   Two towers are in place or planned at four of the facilities:
Mohawk, Oneida, Collins and Gowanda, according to prison officials.

<HEADLINE> The great anagram searchers: Scrabble addicts test skills in Albany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLONIE, N.Y. (AP) - Jan Dixon can't drive without forming words
from the license plate letters on cars ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Introductions to new people are excuses to turn names into
anagrams, rearranging letters to form words and sentences.
</P>
<P>
   So when Dixon discovered Scrabble tournaments in 1977, the
Wilmington, Del., resident had found her niche. ''This is what I've
been waiting for all my life,'' she said. ''These people are nuts,
just like me. You have to realize this game is a sickness.''
</P>
<P>
   Dixon, and 70-some other people with a fondness for shuffling
wooden tiles on game boards spent their Fourth of July competing in
the Fifth Annual Nor'Easter Scrabble Tournament held at a Marriott
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that could be heard over the low clink of the
plastic-coated pieces on Monday as the game began was a constant
stream of ''Shhhhsh.''
</P>
<P>
   Sets of two hovered over game boards, exchanging words only to
take turns, calculate scores, and sometimes bluff the opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Stefan Fatsis became so enthralled by the game two years ago
that he began studying word lists in every and any spare moment -
on the subway, in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   He even took a year's leave from his job as a sports business
reporter to write a book about the vocabulary game invented in
1948.
</P>
<P>
   With the prize purses that most Scrabble tournaments offer, it
would be hard to play the game to the exclusion of all else,
however.
</P>
<P>
   The national tournament in Providence has a purse of $25,000 for
the winner of the expert category. In the contest staged just
outside Albany, the top prize was just $400.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Pfeiffer, a fire safety consultant from New York City who
coordinated the tournament, said most do not play for the money.
</P>
<P>
   ''People play because they are addicted,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Lazio honors vets, marches in three parades to mark July Fourth  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TICONDEROGA, N.Y. (AP) - Republican Senate candidate Rick Lazio
was marching in three Fourth of July parades in northern New York
on Tuesday while trumpeting his accomplishments for veterans in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to pointing at his own record, Lazio's campaign
pressed its criticism of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Rodham
Clinton, who was with President Clinton in New York City observing
OpSail.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's out taking an aircraft carrier for a vanity cruise and
we're out here on Main Street,'' said Lazio political strategist
Mike Murphy. ''I think it really tells the story of the difference
in the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   At a breakfast for Korean War veterans in Saratoga Springs
earlier Tuesday, Lazio himself questioned the first lady's
commitment to veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it goes back to, you know, 'What have you done for New
York?''' Lazio said. ''When New York needed Mrs. Clinton to fight
for veterans health benefits, where was she?''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio also publicized his support for a number of
veterans-related initiatives in Congress and also claimed he has
fought Clinton administration efforts to divert funding for
veterans benefits from New York to ''southern states like Arkansas
and Tennessee.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I went to the floor of the House and succeeded in obtaining a
commitment that New Yorkers would get their fair share, plus a
modest increase in funding,'' Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rick Lazio's rhetoric doesn't match his record,'' Clinton
campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said in a statement. ''While
Hillary Clinton worked to make treating Gulf War illness a
government priority, Rick Lazio was voting (in 1995) to cut $1
billion from the Administration's veterans budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the Saratoga Springs Italian American War Veteran's
Post, Lazio also said he is sponsoring legislation that would have
the U.S. government acknowledge that Italian-Americans were victims
of discrimination and were even interned at times during World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio called it ''a black mark on American history, and on our
freedom, our rights. There was no due process, there was no trial.
People were detained for long periods of time, many times it was
months on end.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his legislation does not call for a government apology.
''It would simply call for a recognition that this act happened,
and an educational process using our agencies to make sure our
Americans understand what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The Long Island congressman, who is on the second leg of a
five-day bus tour across the state, was warmly received in Fourth
of July parades in the Adirondack towns of Argyle and Ticonderoga.
</P>
<P>
   Les Bristol, an 88-year-old veteran of the World War II Battle
of the Bulge, stood on the curb outside his house and Lazio - as he
did many times at the marches - went over and shook his hand.
</P>
<P>
   When asked later if he planned to vote for the congressman,
Bristol, who was a little hard of hearing, said ''Of course I am.
He's a good man.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Ticonderoga parade, people stood three and four deep
along the sidewalks and cheered heartily as Lazio and his wife,
Pat, marched past, accompanied by Rep. John Sweeney, R-Saratoga
County.
</P>
<P>
   At least one supporter from the opposition managed to enter the
line of march briefly carrying a sign for Clinton. Louis Morett
said he's a lifelong Democrat who ''believes in competition.''
Lazio, he said, is ''a good man. There's a lot of things about
Hillary Clinton I don't like - like late-term abortion - but you
have to have competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Tuesday, Lazio ended his day with a parade in Lake Placid.
His ''Mainstream Express'' tour moves on to Plattsburgh, Burke,
Malone, Massena, Watertown and Syracuse on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> 'Wise Professor' Ogilvy: writer of geometry, master of sailing, dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MAMARONECK, N.Y. (AP) - C. Stanley Ogilvy, a mathematics
professor at Hamilton College who wrote as expertly about geometry
as sailing, died June 21 at home. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Ogilvy taught for 20 years at the small, prestigious Hamilton
College in Clinton, N.Y., and wrote books and articles on
mathematics. But at a time when major newspapers routinely had
yachting correspondents, dozens of articles were written about
Ogilvy's expertise in sailing. Known to the nautical community as
the wise professor, he raced the class of boat known as the Star, a
23-foot-long, two-man boat, for more than 30 years, placing third
in the hotly competitive world championship of 1949. Among his
numerous victories were the North American championship and the
Austrian national championship.
</P>
<P>
   He then progressed to a larger class of boats, the Etchells,
which use a three-member crew, and had more success, particularly
at competitions of the Larchmont Yacht Club, where he was a member
for 62 years and the official historian. He saw the club change
from the preserve of Vanderbilts and Morgans to a place where an
ambitious and skilled sailor could make a name for himself on a
modest boat.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Stanley Ogilvy said he was ''a water rat from the
start,'' growing up on the shores of the sound in the Sutton Manor
area of New Rochelle. He began ''messing around with boats'' at a
time other boys were taking their first swings with baseball bats
and began his racing career at age 18 as the crew member on a Star
boat.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, when he joined the Larchmont club, he owned
his own Star. He developed a lifelong obsession with recording each
detail of every race.
</P>
<P>
   Ogilvy once even ventured to suggest that winning is not
everything, a novel thought to many sailboat racers: ''As soon as
the importance of winning the race takes command, the sun is
blotted out, the black clouds descend, and before you know it you
are wearing an angry scowl and can see no farther than the bow of
the boat, if that far,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Owen Torrey, a sailor who competed against Ogilvy for many
years, told of the special spirit then in the salt air of
Larchmont. ''We thought we were the best sailors in the world,''
said Torrey, a maritime lawyer who went on to become a noted sail
designer.
</P>
<P>
   Ogilvy attended the Berkshire School, Williams College,
Cambridge University and Columbia University, eventually earning
his doctorate in mathematics from Syracuse University. In World War
II, he commanded a Navy air sea rescue vehicle in the South
Pacific. He taught at Trinity College before joining Hamilton's
faculty in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   His books on mathematics included ''Through the Mathescope''
(1956), ''Tomorrow's Math'' (1962) and ''Excursions in Geometry''
(1969). Several were translated into other languages, including
Swedish, Flemish, French, German and Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   But teaching was at least as important to him as publications.
Eugene M. Tobin, the president of Hamilton College, quoted John
Anderson, a mathematics professor who died just a week before
Ogilvy, as saying he learned from Ogilvy ''that one's compassion
for students and one's passion for subject are mutually
dependent.''
</P>
<P>
   Ogilvy's books on sailing included three on one-design racing,
the term for classes of boats, like Stars, in which all boats meet
identical specifications. These were ''Successful Yacht Racing,''
''Thoughts on Small Boat Racing'' and ''Win More Sailboat Races.''
</P>
<P>
   John Rousmaniere, a yachting historian, said the books,
published from 1952 to 1977, were characterized by ''their
affection for the sport, graceful expression, rigorous analysis,
and extreme generosity with ideas for racing success that many
other sailors would have regarded as proprietary.''
</P>
<P>
   Ogilvy also wrote ''The Larchmont Yacht Club: A History,
1880-1990'' (1993), which told how the club was carved from
farmland and reached a position of prominence in the racing world.
He did not neglect such intriguing details as the weekly poker game
that began in 1896 even as he chronicled the club's glorious Race
Weeks, which in the 1940's and 1950's featured Arthur Godfrey as
master of ceremonies and performing seals in the swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   Ogilvy never married. He is survived by a brother, Stephen, of
Westport, Conn.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Postpones PRI Party Meeting  </HEADLINE>
By TRACI CARL
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Reeling from its first presidential election
loss in 71 years, the ruling party on Tuesday rejected a
resignation offer from its top official and entire national
executive committee.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Dulce Sauri, head of the Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI, said the board of directors decided to form a
special commission that will ''reflect deeply'' on what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   ''The PRI is still on its feet,'' Sauri said. ''It is alive, it
is in action and will continue to be active on the national
political scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Rafael Oceguera, a member of the executive committee,
told reporters that Sauri decided to resign because ''it was the
most natural thing to do after failing to achieve the objective of
winning the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said President Ernesto Zedillo had recommended naming
former Hidalgo state Gov. Jesus Murillo Karam as the new party
president.
</P>
<P>
   The party leaders' ultimate rejection of this recommendation was
a sign of the dramatic changes that have occurred since the
opposition victory in Sunday's election: In the past, a president's
word was virtually law within the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many people are angry with Zedillo. There is a lot of
irritation and a lot of anger and some even blame him that we
lost,'' said Alfonso Ayenza, an adviser to the defeated
presidential campaign. ''There are people who do not accept it'' --
the president's involvement in choosing the new party leader.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president is only one vote as a party activist,'' said
Angel Rangel, a backer of Tabasco state Gov. Roberto Madrazo.
</P>
<P>
   Governors and politicians solemnly shuttled in and out of the
party's sprawling headquarters Tuesday, some speaking briefly with
hordes of reporters waiting outside, others brushing past without a
word.
</P>
<P>
   Photographs of the PRI's defeated presidential candidate,
Francisco Labastida, his arms raised skyward under the word
''Invincible,'' still decorated the hallways.
</P>
<P>
   Oceguera said he had fought to keep Sauri as president, but many
powerful figures were backing other candidates following the PRI's
greatest political disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Other party leaders have proposed Cesar Camacho, former governor
of Mexico state; Manuel Bartlett, a former governor and interior
secretary, and Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett and Madrazo lost to Labastida in the party's first open
primary in November, and had accused him of being Zedillo's
hand-picked candidate. The allegation seemed to help Labastida win
the support of the party's rank and file.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the party, which was also sent to the news media
Tuesday, Madrazo proposed the creation of a National Transition
Commission to handle party reform. ''What is at stake is the
survival of the party,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo said he was surprised by ''the haste'' with which the
national executive committee had convened ''at such a difficult
time,'' and said he was absent because ''I can't back a proceeding
that ... doesn't match the gravity of our circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo is the first president to break the party tradition of
naming the candidate who would succeed him -- a freedom that many
party activists did not appreciate, particularly after Labastida
fell to defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Several party officials have blamed Zedillo for contributing to
the defeat through political reforms and for accepting it too
quickly Sunday night. One party faction even suggested expelling
him from the PRI -- which in the past would have been a bit like a
priest suggesting expulsion of the pope.
</P>
<P>
   President Plutarco Elias Calles founded the PRI in 1929 to help
strengthen presidential control and to resolve the often-bloody
power struggles among the victors of the Mexican Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The party became synonymous with the government, almost the
nation itself, adopting the red, white and green colors of the
Mexican flag.
</P>
<P>
   It grew to include the country's leading labor, farm, business
and social action groups, with representatives in every village and
city neighborhood in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Political reforms over the past 15 years gradually eroded its
monopoly on power -- which collapsed spectacularly on Sunday when
Vicente Fox of the National Action Party won by 43 percent to 36
percent over Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   Defeat means the party loses control over most of the tens of
thousands of patronage jobs and the social welfare programs that
helped cement its control for generations.
</P>
<P>
   Oceguera said that in the next few days the party will have to
continue working ''without losing the serenity, without rushing
ourselves and without losing the touch and the sense of a
politically democratic direction.''

<HEADLINE> Michelangelo Drawing Goes for $12M  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A Michelangelo drawing that inspired his statue of
the risen Christ was sold to a German art dealer Tuesday for a
record price of more than $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   Katrin Bellinger, a dealer based in Munich, made the winning bid
of $12,378,500, Christie's auctioneers said.
</P>
<P>
   The price -- a record for a drawing by an old master -- was more
than double the pre-sale estimate, and easily exceeded the previous
record of $8,767,818 for Raphael's ''The Head and Hand of an
Apostle,'' sold in London in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The previous record price for a Michelangelo drawing was $7.48
million for ''Christ and the Woman of Samaria,'' which sold in New
York in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The drawing was sold by the estate of Sir Brinsley Ford, who
bought it in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is one of the most beautiful and famous drawings to appear
at auction since the Second World War and expresses the technical
brilliance and power of this master of the Renaissance,'' said Noel
Annesley, deputy chairman of Christie's.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is only a handful of drawings by Michelangelo left in
private hands and this is a superb example.''
</P>
<P>
   The principal drawing is a three-quarter length nude figure.
There are also studies of the legs and of the larger figure.
</P>
<P>
   The drawing was the inspiration for the marble statue of the
risen Christ, commissioned in 1514 for the Church of Santa Maria
sopra Minerva in Rome. It was the only statue Michelangelo
completed in the three decades after he painted the Sistine Chapel,
Christie's said.

<HEADLINE> Rangers 10, Athletics 7  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Rafael Palmeiro hit a tiebreaking,
two-run homer in the sixth inning to lift the Texas Rangers to a
10-7 victory over the Oakland Athletics on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The A's have lost six of seven overall and four in a row to the
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   With the score 7-all, Rusty Greer drew a walk from Scott Service
(1-1) and Palmeiro followed with his 22nd homer.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 383rd home run of Palmeiro's career, moving him ahead
of Jim Rice and Frank Howard into 38th place on the all-time list.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Martinez singled home a run in the Texas eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Doug Davis (2-1) pitched two scoreless innings for the
victory. John Wetteland pitched the ninth for his 21st save.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Grieve gave the A's a 2-0 lead in the first with his 16th
homer. He is a native of Arlington and the son of Rangers TV
analyst Tom Grieve -- both father and son have 65 career home runs
in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   After Ben Grieve's seventh lifetime homer at The Ballpark in
Arlington, Texas came back with a five-run third against Gil
Heredia. Oakland helped the Rangers by making two of its four
errors.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Sheldon led off the third with his first homer. Frank
Catalanotto reached on second baseman Randy Velarde's error and
took third on Rusty Greer's single.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro followed with an RBI single, and Greer scored when
right fielder Matt Stairs' throw went into the Oakland dugout for
another error. Ivan Rodriguez added a sacrifice fly and Mike Lamb
had an RBI single to make it 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, Stairs' 14th homer and Terrence Long's RBI double
cut Texas' lead to 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's run-scoring single in the fourth chased Heredia and
gave the Rangers a 6-4 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland chased Texas starter Esteban Loaiza in the fifth when
Grieve walked and went to third on Stairs' double. Miguel Tejada's
groundout off Francisco Cordero drove in Grieve to make it 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   Texas pushed its lead to 7-5 in the fifth on Gabe Kapler's
run-scoring double. Oakland tied it in the sixth on Velarde's RBI
single and Jason Giambi's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Palmeiro is two homers behind Dwight Evans on the career
homer list. ... Rangers LHP Darren Oliver will be sent to Triple-A
Oklahoma on Wednesday for a rehabilitation assignment. Oliver, on
the 15-day disabled list because of weakness in his left shoulder,
is scheduled to throw about 45 pitches in a game against Nashville.
Oliver will make another start for Oklahoma on Sunday, then will be
further evaluated. ... Sheldon's other big league homer came on May
28, 1997, while with the A's. ... Heredia was 7-1 in his eight
previous road starts. ... Texas has won 10 of its last 12 meetings
with Oakland.

<HEADLINE> Flights To Solomon Islands Canceled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONIARA, Solomon Islands (AP) -- The last international airline
still flying into the embattled Solomon Islands canceled its only
flight into the capital Wednesday as ethnic fighting again
escalated.
</P>
<P>
   Papua New Guinea carrier Air Nuigini said insurance companies
refused to provide cover for the flights into Honiara after rebels
from the island of Malaita fought running battles with rival
Isatabus from the main island of Guadalcanal.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have been engaged in a fierce battle in an area
around Alligator Creek, east of Honiara and close to the city's
international airport.
</P>
<P>
   At least two Isatabu fighters were killed on Monday when
Malaitans drove a bulldozer reinforced with armor plating and
mounted machine guns across a bridge that previously had separated
the two sides and began attacking.
</P>
<P>
   There were also reports of Malaitan fighters attacking civilians
and forcing them from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The renewed fighting -- which shattered a two-week truce -- stems
from a dispute between the Malaitans and the Isatabus, who have
expelled 20,000 migrants from Malaita who sought jobs and land on
Guadalcanal. Up to 60 people have been killed in 19 months of
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes for peace were raised last Friday when a new prime
minister, Manasseh Sogavare, was elected who pledged to convene
fresh peace talks. But since then, the Isatabu rebels have said
they do not recognize Sogavare's government, calling the election
rigged by Malaitans.
</P>
<P>
   In another blow to the peace process, the new opposition, led by
former Prime Minister Bartholomew Ulufa'alu, said it may launch a
legal challenge to the new government's legitimacy. Six of his
members in parliament claim they did not attend the vote at which
Sogavare was elected by a narrow majority because they were
threatened by Malaitan rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Ulufa'alu resigned after being seized at gunpoint by Malaitan
rebels.

<HEADLINE> Nevada Road Reopened in Protest  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA CHEREB
<TEXT>
<P>
   JARBIDGE, Nev. (AP) -- Protesters from around the West and as far
away as the East Coast spent Independence Day reopening a dirt road
in a national forest in defiance of the U.S. Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds joined a ''tug-of-war'' line tied to a boulder the
protesters dubbed the ''Liberty Rock.'' The boulder blocked access
to a stretch of road leading to campgrounds and a wilderness area
in a remote corner of northeastern Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Chanting ''Freedom, Freedom,'' the Shovel Brigade moved the
boulder inch-by-inch Tuesday. The crowd cheered as the rock was
removed and a pickup truck carrying 90-year-old Helen Wilson, the
oldest resident in Jarbidge, drove over the 900-foot section of
reopened road.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can see what people power does,'' said John Carpenter, a
state legislator from Elko. ''People power can move these rocks and
it can move the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration was the latest chapter in a dispute between
Washington officials and locals upset with federal land policy. The
brigade claims the county owns the narrow dirt road and the Forest
Service is the intruder.
</P>
<P>
   South Canyon Road was washed out in a flood in 1995. Federal
authorities have blocked efforts to reopen it, fearing road repairs
would jeopardize habitat of the threatened bull trout, which is
protected under the Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a federal judge denied an injunction sought by the
Justice Department to halt the rally, but warned members of the
brigade they could be prosecuted for any environmental damage.
</P>
<P>
   Though the road was not completely rebuilt and the turnout was
far less than the 5,000 some had predicted, organizers claimed
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their fight is my fight back there,'' said Scott Traudt, 34, a
commercial fisherman from Warwick, R.I. who said loggers, ranchers
and others like himself who make their living from the land are
frustrated by increased government regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had enough. We're all getting unified.''
</P>
<P>
   The only environmentalists at the gathering was a group called
''The Old Broads for Wilderness.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They're making a mess to make a point about the federal
government,'' said the group's executive director, Susan Tixier.
''I don't think the Forest Service is always right, but here they
did the right thing closing the road.''

Western Slope Fires Surge
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CRAIG, Colo. (AP) -- Two wildfires on Colorado's Western Slope surged forward
Tuesday in conditions so dry that brush burning at one location was likened to
kindling. A blaze in the Dinosaur National Monument in remote northwestern
Colorado was burning an estimated 9,000 acres, while a smaller fire about 35
miles southwest of Grand Junction had consumed about 2,500 acres. Winds were
reported at 20 mph at several points and temperatures ranged into the 90s. The
Dinosaur blaze, which began Monday, was burning mostly on federal land, said
Lynn Barclay, spokeswoman with the Craig Interagency Dispatch center. No
structures were immediately threatened.

Prosecutor Opens Echelon Probe

   PARIS (AP) -- A French prosecutor has opened a preliminary investigation into
a U.S.-led spy network that has left many Europeans suspicious that their
businesses are being monitored, judicial sources said Tuesday. Paris prosecutor
Jean-Pierre Dintilhac in May asked the DST, France's internal security service,
to carry out the preliminary inquiry, according to a report in Tuesday's Le
Figaro newspaper. The report was confirmed by judicial sources who spoke on
condition they not be named. The Echelon issue surfaced in February when a
European Parliament report discussed the existence and activities of the
network, whose members also include Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

soldiers who were sympathetic to rebel leader George Speight had confiscated
arms and ammunition Tuesday inside the base at Labasa, on the northern island of

afterward. Accompanied by his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, Elian visited the
homes of his paternal and maternal grandparents in Cardenas, about 90 miles east

will resume his studies in the fall, and played with several of his schoolmates

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Gang Clashes With Soldiers  </HEADLINE>
By SEAN YOONG
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAUK, Malaysia (AP) -- A gang that raided two military armories
fought off nearly 1,000 soldiers and police Wednesday and managed
to hold on to at least three hostages in the jungles of northern
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with machine guns, security forces created makeshift
bunkers inside the dense forests, where gunbattles have been going
on intermittently since the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the gang disguised themselves as senior military
officers on a surprise inspection and fooled sentries at two
military camps, gaining easy entry to the armories. They escaped
with more than 100 assault rifles, grenade launchers and thousands
of rounds of ammunition from the bases in Perak state.
</P>
<P>
   The raid has shaken Malaysia's security system and raised
concerns about the efficiency and alertness of its military. Some
opposition leaders have demanded the defense minister's
resignation, while letters to newspapers have called for a security
overhaul in the Southeast Asian nation.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh fighting erupted early Wednesday when the gunmen tried to
shoot their way out of an army commando cordon. There were two
gunbattles, each about 10 minutes long, said a military officer
speaking on condition of anonymity. There were no reports of
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   While police denied there were government casualties in the
encounters between the military and the armory raiders, Wednesday's
newspapers published pictures of soldiers being treated for bullet
wounds.
</P>
<P>
   The government has not said if it knows where the weapons were
headed. Independent military experts say the guns may have been
stolen by mercenaries for use by Muslim separatist rebels in the
southern Philippines or in Indonesia's Aceh province.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have remained secretive about the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Najib Tun Razak said Tuesday night that three
people were being held, two who were believed to be police
intelligence officers nabbed while on a reconnaissance mission
inside the forest Monday. The third was a farmer, he said.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Election Changes Relations  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the exception of Cuba, it was hard to
imagine a country in the Western Hemisphere more unfriendly to the
United States than Mexico not long ago.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1980s, Mexico was supporting the leftist adversaries
of the United States in Central America. For then-Secretary of
State George Shultz, the mere idea of a meeting with his Mexican
counterpart, Bernardo Sepulveda, caused him stress. At the State
Department, anti-Mexican jokes were commonplace and Mexico's
corruption problems were discussed openly.
</P>
<P>
   Those days are long gone, as a cooperative relationship that few
thought possible is now in place. Frictions over Central America
disappeared with the end of the Cold War. And then came Mexico's
decision to join the North American Free Trade Agreement, which has
boosted two-way trade to over $200 billion from $80 billion in six
years.
</P>
<P>
   George Grayson, a Mexico expert at the College of William and
Mary, says a revolution has occurred in the relationship. ''It's
really night and day,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And with the election of opposition candidate Vicente Fox in
Sunday's presidential election, President Clinton says the friendly
ties established under President Ernesto Zedillo could well be
enhanced.
</P>
<P>
   Fox says he is committed to the counternarcotics struggle and to
pursuing economic policies that will ensure that jobless Mexicans
won't have to move to the United States in search of a better life.
</P>
<P>
   In the run-up to the election, American officials were worried
that a narrow victory by the ruling PRI party could trigger charges
of fraud -- and a possible full-blown political crisis. That did not
occur, and all indications point toward a peaceful transfer of
power on Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   American officials become uneasy at the specter of unrest across
the border because that can only mean more unwanted illegal
migrants.
</P>
<P>
   But just as the United States has a stake in a prosperous,
stable Mexico, Mexico has a strong interest in an economically
vibrant northern neighbor. This explains why Mexico has pushed the
OPEC oil cartel to increase production. More oil on the market
means lower oil prices and greater assurance of continued U.S.
prosperity. This, in turn, means continued strong U.S. demand for
Mexican products.
</P>
<P>
   One issue that continues to infect the relationship is the
annual congressionally mandated U.S. evaluation of Mexico's
counterdrug performance. In theory, economic sanctions could be
imposed if Mexico's performance is deemed inadequate. But officials
acknowledge that the possibility of a ''decertification'' of Mexico
is unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics argue that, in the process, standards have been
lowered, and that Mexico is being judged nowadays more by effort
than by results.
</P>
<P>
   But, as officials point out, a decision to decertify Mexico
would touch off a nationalistic backlash that would nullify many of
the across-the-board gains in cross-border ties.
</P>
<P>
   Grayson says the ever-growing numbers of Mexican migrants who
vote in U.S. elections also has had a salutary effect on
Mexican-American ties because American politicians are less
inclined to engage in Mexico-bashing.
</P>
<P>
   He says the major political parties, taking their cues from
Latino leaders, increasingly are turning a blind eye toward illegal
immigration lest they pay a price on election day.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the more neighborly relationship, resentments among
Mexicans toward the United States persist in other areas.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, there was a hue and cry last fall when Mexican
authorities invited several dozen FBI agents to investigate a
possible mass grave 20 miles south of the Rio Grande. The
invitation was viewed by many in Mexico as kowtowing to Uncle Sam.
</P>
<P>
   Another sore point is the emergence of vigilante groups,
especially in southern Arizona, that prey on undocumented Mexican
aliens. Mexico also has complained loudly about the increase in
U.S. patrols at ''safe'' border crossings, forcing would-be
migrants to risk their lives in more dangerous areas. Hundreds have
died in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The overall trend, though, is positive, especially now that
Mexico seems unambiguously to be on the democratic path after long
years of quasi-authoritarian rule.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has always been a neighbor but not necessarily a friend.
It is now both, as Clinton noted on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Teachers Debate Bonus Systems  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- The nation's largest teachers' union is
considering accepting the increasingly popular view that teachers'
pay should be linked with how well they have been teaching, instead
of how long.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 10,000 delegates to the National Education Association
meeting here will decide on Wednesday what strategies local units
should take when school boards propose bonus-pay plans in
collective bargaining. This marks the first time the NEA has
formally considered the divisive bonus-pay issue at its annual
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Bonus-pay critics, who are expected to heat up the debate,
reject such plans as arbitrary and unfair to teachers who have
unusually difficult students. Backers, which include some state
union leaders, say rewarding good teachers would bring the
profession respect, top-notch candidates and higher salaries for
all.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what's going to happen, but it's going to be a
good debate and it's going to be a close debate,'' NEA President
Bob Chase said in an interview on the eve of the vote. ''The fact
is a lot of our local associations have been willing to look at
alternative pay schedules on top of existing plans.''
</P>
<P>
   A handful of states offer rewards that teachers can use for
computers or training, although not for their own pay. But recent
demands by business leaders and politicians for higher standards
often include calls for teacher cash incentives. Some form of
reward has even been proposed by the two leading presidential
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pay-for-performance'' plans usually give teachers higher
salaries or bonuses if they're judged to be good at what they do,
accept extra or difficult assignments, mentor others on how to
become more effective, or more controversially, have students who
score higher on tests.
</P>
<P>
   Many teachers say that's unfair if they have students suffering
from abuse, neglect or other ills that they can't affect or
control. But some, such as New York Mayor Rudolph Guiliani, still
propose bonuses based on test scores. Cincinnati last month became
the first public district to replace its pay-by-seniority scale
with pay based on performance.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to be ready to deal with that,'' Chase said of the
NEA.
</P>
<P>
   The key proposal before the delegates would allow the national
group to at least help local units do the research needed to decide
whether to accept a plan in a contract.
</P>
<P>
   In some views, the NEA, representing more than half of the
nation's 3.1 million teachers, is taking baby steps. Supporters of
stronger plans -- some of which tie student test scores to teacher
pay -- blame low teacher salaries on union contracts that base pay
on how many years a teacher has spent in the classroom or whether
he or she has a master's degree.
</P>
<P>
   ''Engineers and computer scientists who cannot do the job are
usually let go, while the successful ones earn high salaries,''
said Lissette Bishins, spokeswoman for the Center for Education
Reform. ''This is not the case for teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   John McDonald, a Dearborn, Mich., college professor and local
president of organized higher-education faculty there, says
contracts also must protect the employee. ''Tenure does not grant
job protection for the incompetent. We do want people to have a
fair shake.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, teachers have been wary of reward systems,
fearing that a principal may keep fattening the paycheck of a
favored teacher or dock teachers each time a child brings home a
''D.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Can you imagine paying a doctor by who she saved or who he
saved?'' said Randi Weingarten, president of the New York
Federation of Teachers. ''Who would an oncologist see?''
</P>
<P>
   She said raising base pay to attract better teachers is the
answer: ''We need to say to prospective hires, 'You can make a
living wage. This is not missionary work.'''
</P>
<P>
   A report released Tuesday by the 1 million-member American
Federation of Teachers said teachers still get paid less than other
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1998-99 school year, the average teacher made $40,574.
The union compared that with the average pay in 1999 for other
white-collar jobs: engineers earned $68,294 on average; computer
systems analysts, $66,782; lawyers, $69,104.

<HEADLINE> Argentines Seek Damages For Sinking  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL AMES
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Argentine relatives of sailors killed
in Britain's sinking of a warship in the Falklands Islands war
presented a complaint to the European Court of Human Rights for
damages from the British government.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives' lawyers contended the cruiser General Belgrano
was torpedoed beyond the 200-mile military ''exclusion zone''
imposed by Britain around the Falklands Islands during the 10-week
war in 1982. Of the General Belgrano's 1,093 crew members, 323
died.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers, Jorge Appiani and Jorge Antonio Olivera, also
contend the only aim ''was to frustrate peace negotiations'' for
the islands, called Las Malvinas by Argentines.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel is expected to take several months before
deciding whether the complaints are admissible at the European
court based in Strasbourg, France.
</P>
<P>
   A military government in Argentina ordered an invasion of the
islands in 1982 to back its claim that it inherited the Falklands
from the Spanish crown before they were occupied by Britain in
1833. The archipelago is populated by about 2,200 people of mostly
British ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   The war claimed at least 970 lives before British forces
regained control of the islands.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina never sought damages after the war and only restored
diplomatic relations in 1990. Argentina still maintains its claims
to the islands.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Star Eyes World Cup Triumph  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT MILLWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- Unlike his famous namesake, Abedi
Pele never played in a World Cup. Now, retired Ghanaian soccer star
hopes to play a role in a historic one.
</P>
<P>
   One of Africa's best known players, Pele is on the team bidding
to bring the 2006 World Cup to South Africa when the FIFA executive
committee votes on the venue Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa is up against two European powerhouses, Germany and
England, and another African candidate, Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   Pele, who played for several years in Europe for Olympique
Marseille, Torino and 1860 Munich, dreams of seeing the stars of
the world playing a World Cup in Africa for the first time. That's
why he and Cameroon soccer great Roger Milla have joined the South
African bidding team.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not just an emotional or sentimental thing to have the
World Cup in Africa. It's right in practical terms too,'' said the
Ghanaian, who was renamed Pele after the famous Brazilian star
because he was so talented as a child.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have nothing against Morocco or the Moroccan bid, but the
facilities in South Africa are wonderful. You only have to look at
the FIFA inspection committee's report to get confirmation of that.
</P>
<P>
   ''But look at what it means to Africa to have the big European
stars playing on African soil. For me, as an African, it would be a
dream come true,'' Pele said.
</P>
<P>
   ''And there's no reason why an African team wouldn't win the
2006 World Cup in Africa. Cameroon got to the quarterfinal and lost
narrowly to England. Nigeria got to the same stage in 1994 and was
unlucky to lose to Italy, and it also won the Olympic title in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''African soccer is getting stronger all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The four bids were being presented to the 24 FIFA executive
members on Wednesday, and South Africa looked a strong favorite.
</P>
<P>
   As well as impressing a FIFA inspection team with its
facilities, including nine stadiums already built, the South
Africans have attracted support because none of the 16 previous
World Cups have been in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The next one, being co-hosted by South Korea and Japan in 2002,
is in Asia for the first time. FIFA president Sepp Blatter, who is
campaigning for a rotation of the confederations, also is backing
an African World Cup in 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Europe has played host to nine World Cups, and that doesn't help
the bids of England and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil was going to be in the vote, too, but pulled out on
Monday, promising to pass on its vote to South Africa in return for
African votes for its proposed bid in 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Franz Beckenbauer, head of the German bid, described the deal as
''horse-trading'' and said the Germans considered pulling out as a
result.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tradeoff is so obvious that it begins to smell,'' the
former World Cup star said. ''When we heard that the decision had
apparently been made, we wondered whether we should come here at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Beckenbauer's mood was in contrast to that of Danny Jordaan, the
man leading the South African bid.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very pleased and encouraged by Brazil's decision,''
Jordaan said. ''It's the result of many months and years of
discussions, but we are even at this stage working very hard right
up the last minute, taking absolutely nothing for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ''The FIFA technical report stated that our bid is extremely
well qualified and the contest boils down to a decision between
giving Europe a 10th World Cup or to awarding Africa a first World
Cup.''

<HEADLINE> Jalabert Advances in Tour de France  </HEADLINE>
By IAN PHILLIPS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT-NAZAIRE, France (AP) -- Frenchman Laurent Jalabert savored
wearing the leader's yellow jersey for the first time in five
years, sounding a warning to defending champion Lance Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a good year for the French,'' Jalabert said after
his Once team won Tuesday's team time trial. ''Mary Pierce won the
French Open, France won Euro 2000. Why not think about a Frenchman
winning the tour?''
</P>
<P>
   Germany's Jan Ullrich, Italian Marco Pantani and Switzerland's
Alex Zulle are widely considered the most likely threats to
Armstrong's title.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, only Ullrich has managed to stay within sight of the
American, who was third in the overall standings. Jalabert, whose
career has been resurrected this year, currently stands 24 seconds
ahead of Armstrong after Tuesday's victory.
</P>
<P>
   It could have been more.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Jalabert earned a 44-second cushion over the
American. But race officials later deducted 20 seconds off each of
his Once team's riders after its manager, Manolo Saiz, was judged
to have given them an unfair advantage by purposefully driving
alongside them to protect them from an energy-sapping headwind.
</P>
<P>
   But Jalabert was happy just to be in front.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've worked hard for this moment and we will now try our
hardest to hold onto the jersey,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old Frenchman's team finished the 43-mile race from
Nantes to the Atlantic port of Saint-Nazaire in 1 hour, 25 minutes
and 36 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's U.S. Postal team was second. Ullrich's Deutsche
Telekom was third.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time since Laurent Desbiens in 1998 that a
Frenchman has won the yellow jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''This stage was very important to us,'' Jalabert said. ''We
were meticulous down to the last detail. If you start a stage like
this full of fear, it's difficult to get anywhere. If you're
confident, it makes all the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Many thought Jalabert's career was over.
</P>
<P>
   The Frenchman pulled out of the 1998 race at the height of a
doping scandal to protest how police were searching through the
cyclists' hotels for banned substances.
</P>
<P>
   He then clashed with French authorities after refusing to
undergo mandatory health checks. He was excluded from the national
team in 1999 and missed last year's Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
   He said Tuesday's victory marked a crossroads in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a new beginning,'' he said. ''I hope it lasts.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain's David Millar, on the Cofidis team, had held the yellow
jersey since Saturday's opening individual time trial. But after
Tuesday's stage, he slipped to 24th.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the day's biggest casualty was Switzerland's Zulle, who
started the day in sixth place, 22 seconds off the leader. By the
evening, he was way back in 56th, trailing by 4 minutes, 19
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The teams set out from the city of Nantes with a strong headwind
buffeting them all the way.
</P>
<P>
   Racing against the clock, teamwork and communication was key.
Riders shuttled back and forth every few hundred yards to take
turns against strong winds.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the race was flat except for a steady climb over a long
bridge heading toward the finish.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's race covers 125 miles from Vannes to Vitre in
Brittany.

<HEADLINE> Gore Challenges Pharmaceutical Group  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore is challenging a
pharmaceutical industry-backed group critical of his Medicare
prescription drug plan to make public its list of donors.
</P>
<P>
   ''The American people deserve to know who exactly is trying to
influence this critical issue,''' Gore said in a letter to leaders
of Citizens for Better Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Gore decried the ''unlimited secret amount of
money'' flowing to special interest groups seeking to sway the
debate on critical issues.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has clashed repeatedly with Citizens for Better Medicare,
which has attacked his plans to expand Medicare by adding a
prescription drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Congress recently approved and President Clinton signed a change
in campaign finance law designed to prevent some politically active
issue advocacy groups from keeping their lists of contributors
secret.
</P>
<P>
   The change would affect Citizens for Better Medicare, which has
run millions of dollars in television commercials attacking plans
to add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare. The Clinton
administration has proposed a Medicare drug plan, and Gore has made
a similar proposal an important part of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, accusing drug companies of ''price gouging,'' says the
industry is attacking his Medicare plan in order to protect rapidly
growing profits.
</P>
<P>
   The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America is a
backer of Citizens for Better Medicare. In its TV ads, the group
argues against imposing any Canadian-style government price
controls on prescription drugs in this country, saying research
funds would dry up as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans, who favor a prescription drug benefit
plan operated through private insurance companies, also argue that
the Democratic proposals would create a big-government drug
program. Republicans pushed their bill through the House this month
in the face of a White House veto threat, but the measure's
prospects are uncertain in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Gore said the recent congressional action on
secret donations did not require that past donor lists be made
public.
</P>
<P>
   ''The donors who have already funneled millions to front special
interest groups can remain safely hidden,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I call on your organization to reveal the sources of your
million-dollar campaign so Americans can understand the real voices
in this critical debate, not special interest cloaked in secrecy,''
Gore said. ''It is already clear that the real faces behind
Citizens for Better Medicare are not those of America's elderly.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore plans to make his demand public at a campaign stop in the
battleground state of Pennsylvania on Monday, but a copy of the
letter was obtained by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was speaking to the American Federation of Teachers on
Wednesday in Philadelphia, then heading to Chicago to address the
National Education Association. NEA delegates voted Tuesday to
endorse Gore for president, citing his support of higher pay for
teachers. Gore already had won the endorsement of the union's board
of directors. AFT also has endorsed Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Although his audience will be teachers -- and he's made education
a big issue -- Gore planned to continue his focus on health care,
and more specifically expanding the prescription drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Under Gore's plan, the government would pay half the annual
costs of a Medicare recipient's drugs up to $5,000. Aides said it
would extend coverage to 40 million people at a cost of $255
billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign argues that Citizens for Better Medicare has
spent up to $30 million on television spots attacking the
prescription drug benefit, and could spend as much as $65 million.
</P>
<P>
   Among its arguments, the group says expanding Medicare to
include prescription drugs is an expensive new program that
threatens the financial health of the Medicare system, an
allegation Gore rejects.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president argues that rival George W. Bush is a tool of
rich drug makers, while Gore claims he's seeking to aid struggling
working families.

<HEADLINE> British Approve Former Spy's Novel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The British government says it will not try to
stop the publication of former spy David Shayler's new novel.
</P>
<P>
   The former MI5 man's first book, which is about incompetent
bungling in the British intelligence services, passed smoothly by
the government censors, who did not change a word, the Home Office
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Shayler, 34, wrote ''The Organisation,'' a fiction story he
described as ''a gritty thriller about spies, sex and football,''
while living in forced exile in France.
</P>
<P>
   He was required to submit a manuscript to comply with a
government injunction in 1997 barring him from disclosing any
information he obtained while working for MI5, Britain's internal
security agency.
</P>
<P>
   Shayler worked for MI5 from 1994 until 1997, when he claimed
that the agency kept files on a number of politicians, including
the current home secretary, Jack Straw, and the Northern Ireland
secretary, Peter Mandelson.
</P>
<P>
   He has also said Britain was involved in a plot to assassinate
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. The British government has denied
involvement in such a plan.
</P>
<P>
   Shayler was arrested in France in 1998 on a British warrant on
charges of breaking the Official Secrets Act, but a French appeals
court rejected an extradition bid. Despite the risk of arrest if he
returns to Britain, Shayler says he is determined to come home this
year to clear his name.
</P>
<P>
   The government has also filed a separate civil suit accusing
Shayler of violating his contract and copyright laws by releasing
secret documents to British newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the British news agency, Press Association, from his
exile in Paris, Shayler said he was thrilled that his novel can go
forward.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've passed it without changing a word. I think they had no
other choice,'' Shayler said. ''The government has realized that
they can't go around behaving like bosses from the Soviet Union.''
</P>
<P>
   The novel has not been sold to a publisher yet.

<HEADLINE> Museum Caters To Handicapped  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Can't move close enough to read the label on a
painting? Having trouble making out the shape and color of those
disease germs on a slide? Action going too fast on the video
accompanying a display?
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of American History is preparing a show with new ways
to help people who don't see well, or who use wheelchairs or have
other disabilities get more enjoyment while visiting one of this
city's many exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Ott, curator of the show, stressed the importance of
technology for the handicapped, and the show, celebrating the 10th
anniversary of the Americans With Disabilities Act, will
demonstrate new methods of presenting data for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit includes a telecaptioner for TV, a note-taker for
the blind that uses the Braille alphabet, a CD for access to the
Internet and two kiosks with computer monitors.
</P>
<P>
   The kiosks come in two heights -- one for a person standing and
one for a someone in a wheelchair -- explained Steve Jacobs. who
heads a group at NCR Corp. devoted to using technology to help the
handicapped. His group worked with the Smithsonian Institution to
develop the kiosks.
</P>
<P>
   The same technology can be adapted to reach potential customers
who neither have a computer, know how to use one or even have the
courage to try, Jacobs said. Three buttons on the kiosk help
control what appears on the monitor or is read out on its
loudspeaker. But a touch on the screen can help too.
</P>
<P>
   It's called ''universally disposable interface technology.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There are 1.4 billion people in the world who've never had the
opportunity to learn to read,'' he said. ''There are 450 million
over 65 who don't have the abilities they had when they were 21.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit traces the history of the movement for the disabled
over the past 50 years. It includes such items as one of the
earliest lightweight wheelchairs, signs and T-shirts used by ADA
proponents at demonstrations urging passage of the law and the pen
President Bush used when he signed it on July 26, 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the museum said the exhibit would open July 6 and
remain on view for at least a year.

<HEADLINE> Hill: Leaning Toward Orlando  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Goodbye, Detroit, Hello, Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   That's the word from All-Star forward Grant Hill, who
acknowledged he's close to a deal with the Magic after six seasons
with the Pistons.
</P>
<P>
   After house-hunting in central Florida, Hill and his wife flew
back to Michigan on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   NBA rules prohibit free agents from signing contracts until Aug.
1.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm leaning'' toward signing with Orlando, Hill told Detroit
News columnist Bob Wojnowski on a flight from Orlando to Detroit on
Tuesday. ''Well, it's not 100 percent, but it's close.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know people will be upset, but I felt I did everything I
could do here,'' Hill said. ''I love Detroit. I enjoy the people.
This is just a golden opportunity, for basketball reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish the Pistons well, I really do.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Dumars, who became the Pistons' president for basketball
operations last month, had re-signing Hill as his first and biggest
job.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't comment until I talk with Grant,'' Dumars told the
Detroit Free Press.
</P>
<P>
   The Orlando Sentinel on Tuesday quoted two NBA sources as saying
Hill was preparing to sign with Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Magic general manager John Gabriel said he knew nothing of the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Hill has spent his entire NBA career with Detroit, and the
Pistons reached the playoffs in four of his six seasons, but have
never won a series. Last season, he averaged 25.8 points,
third-best in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic are offering Hill and San Antonio free agent Tim
Duncan six-year deals worth $67.5 million, the most allowed under
the collective bargaining agreement. They can get seven-year, $86.5
million contracts if the Magic agree to sign-and-trade proposals
with the Pistons and Duncan's team, the San Antonio Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have gotten conflicting reports while he was down there,''
Dumars told the News. ''First, I heard that Grant was committing
and Tim was not. Then, the next day, I heard that Grant was not
committing and Tim was. So I am not making any assumptions until we
talk.''
</P>
<P>
   During the past year, the Magic cleared an estimated $20 million
of salary cap space, enabling them to offer the maximum first-year
salary of $9 million to two star players.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic entertained both players throughout the weekend.
Duncan left Monday without commenting to the media.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic are hoping Hill can sway Duncan into signing with
Orlando, which could radically alter the balance of power in the
Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they both enjoyed themselves here,'' Gabriel said.
''They are two individuals who will make their decision on their
own. It's hard for us to speculate on what helps a person make a
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Detroit first-round draft pick Mateen Cleaves said last week
that he hoped to share the court with Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've already had people out looking for Grant,'' he said. ''I
really want him to stay. It would be an honor to play with him, and
he would be a great mentor to me. He could take me under his wing
just like Joe took him.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill's departure would give Detroit $8.27 million more next
season under the NBA salary cap. But with or without Hill, the
Pistons would be able to buy an elite player or two to keep them
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Dumars has already spoken to Indiana's Jalen Rose, a product of
Detroit Southwestern High School and the University of Michigan.
Rose was impressed with Dumars' plan, but early reports indicate
Rose is leaning toward re-signing with the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   Among other free agents Dumars hopes to bring in are Portland
power forward Brian Grant, Clippers power forward Maurice Taylor,
Indiana power forward Austin Croshere, Houston guard Cuttino
Mobley, Portland guard Greg Anthony and Utah guard Howard Eisley.

<HEADLINE> Landless Brazilians To Get Aid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- The government has set aside more than
$1 billion for land reforms, including resettlement for 260,000
families of landless farmers in an apparent effort to defuse
growing rural unrest.
</P>
<P>
   The government said the money will be used to build homes for
landless farmers by 2002 and for health, electrification, farm
credit and education programs.
</P>
<P>
   The reforms were announced after a meeting Monday by President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso and leaders of the Landless Rural Workers
Movement.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Movement leader Gilberto Portes said his organization
would not occupy any land for at least 20 days.
</P>
<P>
   The group has occupied land it considers underused or
unproductive as a way to pressure the government to speed up land
reform.
</P>
<P>
   The army has even deployed troops near the president's ranch in
east-central Brazil after about 400 Movement farmers said they
planned to march into the property.

Fires Roar in Colorado
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CRAIG, Colo. (AP) -- Two wildfires on Colorado's Western Slope surged forward
Tuesday in conditions so dry that brush burning at one location was likened to
kindling. A blaze in the Dinosaur National Monument in remote northwestern
Colorado was burning an estimated 9,000 acres, while a smaller fire about 35
miles southwest of Grand Junction had consumed about 2,500 acres. Winds were
reported at 20 mph at several points and temperatures ranged into the 90s. The
Dinosaur blaze, which began Monday, was burning mostly on federal land. No
structures were immediately threatened.

Protestants Menace North Ireland
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Masked youths set vehicles ablaze and
police traded gunshots with protesters in a Protestant area of Belfast Tuesday,
as anti-Catholic extremists menaced the streets of Northern Ireland for a second
straight night. Rage flared as the British territory braced for more violent
Protestant protest over British authorities' determination to restrict
traditional parades in Catholic areas. The paramilitary outlaws coordinating the
mayhem from behind the scenes have warned that rioting will intensify if the
Orange Order, a legal Protestant fraternal group, isn't allowed to conduct a
banned march through the main Catholic district of Portadown on Sunday.

Prosecutor Opens Echelon Probe
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- A French prosecutor has opened a preliminary investigation into
a U.S.-led spy network that has left many Europeans suspicious that their
businesses are being monitored, judicial sources said Tuesday. Paris prosecutor
Jean-Pierre Dintilhac in May asked the DST, France's internal security service,
to carry out the preliminary inquiry, according to a report in Tuesday's Le
Figaro newspaper. The Echelon issue surfaced in February when a European
Parliament report discussed the existence and activities of the network, whose
members also include Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

Fiji Military Defuses Troop Protest
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- The military quelled a protest by troops at a Fiji army
base Wednesday, but said local chiefs threatened disturbances in support of
rebels who have been holding 27 people hostage for seven weeks. Two or three
soldiers who were sympathetic to rebel leader George Speight had confiscated
arms and ammunition Tuesday inside the base at Labasa, on the northern island of
Vanua Levu. ''All of the arms are back in the armory and the soldiers have
resumed normal duty,'' Lt. Col. Filipo Tarakinikini told The Associated Press.

Elian Pays Visit to Hometown

   HAVANA (AP) -- Without the hordes of journalists who chronicled his movements
in the United States, Elian Gonzalez Tuesday made a quiet visit to his hometown
for the first time since returning to Cuba last week, the government said
afterward. Accompanied by his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, Elian visited the
homes of his paternal and maternal grandparents in Cardenas, about 90 miles east
of Havana, state television reported. Elian also stopped by his school, where he
will resume his studies in the fall, and played with several of his schoolmates
before he and his family returned to Havana later in the day.

Mexico's President-Elect Lays Out Plans

   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico's president-elect Tuesday laid out sweeping plans
for a new justice system, a more human rights-oriented foreign policy and a
multiparty Cabinet. Opposition leader Vicente Fox, who won Sunday's presidential
elections, also pledged to eliminate the posturing and tension in U.S.-Mexico
relations over the two countries' border, where immigration-related incidents
have sometimes broken into violence in recent months.

Study Backs Birth Control Pills
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A new report suggests that while women taking birth control
pills -- even the newer, low-dose forms -- are at higher risk of stroke, that
risk is outweighed by the contraceptive benefits of the pills. The low-dose
forms, taken by most of the more than 10 million U.S. women using oral
contraceptives, contain less estrogen than the pill introduced 40 years ago and
are thought to be safer. Still, women taking them were nearly twice as likely as
non-users to suffer a stroke. However, since strokes are so rare in women of
reproductive age, the risk translates to only one additional stroke yearly per
24,000 women for low-dose pill users.

   HOUSTON (AP) -- Randy Johnson predictably outpitched Jose Lima, with rookie
Jason Conti hitting a bases-loaded double in a seven-run third inning Tuesday
night to lead the Arizona Diamondbacks over the Houston Astros 10-4. Johnson
(13-2), who leads the NL in victories, allowed four hits in six innings. He
struck out eight. Lima (1-13) dropped his 13th straight decision and leads the
majors in losses. He left after Arizona's burst in the third inning, highlighted
by Conti's three-run double and Damian Miller's two-run homer.

<HEADLINE> Protestants Menace North Ireland  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Barricades, broken glass and
smoldering cars dotted half a dozen flashpoints in Belfast early
Wednesday, as anti-Catholic extremists vented their rage at British
authorities' determination to restrict traditional Protestant
parades from Catholic areas.
</P>
<P>
   Violence in the British province escalated during a third night
of unrest by hard-line Protestants. Police exchanged shots with
gunmen in a Protestant area of north Belfast on Tuesday night, and
masked youths hijacked vehicles and set them on fire in several
parts of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Near the volatile town of Portadown, 30 miles to the southwest,
police used water cannons -- rarely deployed in Northern Ireland --
to disperse several hundred people protesting the banning of a
Protestant march through a Catholic neighborhood this Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The paramilitary outlaws coordinating the mayhem have warned
that rioting will intensify unless the Orange Order, a legal
Protestant fraternal group, is allowed to march along the disputed
Garvaghy Road. Britain and the province's police commander, Chief
Constable Ronnie Flanagan, say that won't be allowed to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary, Peter Mandelson, condemned
the violence as ''thuggery, nothing more and nothing less.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Catholics despise Orange parades, which often feature
drum-thumping ''kick the pope'' bands and commemorate 300-year-old
Protestant victories over Catholics. More than 2,000 such parades
are staged each summer, only a few dozen of which go through
predominantly Catholic areas.
</P>
<P>
   Confrontations over Orangemen's thwarted efforts to parade down
the Garvaghy Road ignited widespread street violence in 1996, 1997
and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Relative peace reigned last year after Orange leaders opted not
to challenge a joint police-army blockade at their Portadown
march's midway point, an Anglican church near the Catholic area.
</P>
<P>
   But history appears set to repeat itself with tensions and
destruction mounting -- and some of the province's most feared
terrorists returning to the fore.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians from all sides on Tuesday criticized Johnny ''Mad
Dog'' Adair, a leading Belfast member of the outlawed Ulster
Defense Association who was paroled from prison this year under
terms of Northern Ireland's 1998 peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary said police returned gunfire
Tuesday night after they were fired on from an area near the lower
Shankhill Road -- where Adair is UDA commander.
</P>
<P>
   There were no reports of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Adair, infamous for boasting about his past slayings of Catholic
civilians, led more than 100 supporters late Monday to police lines
at the confrontation zone outside Portadown.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Adair and his entourage cheered at three masked men from
a Portadown-based terror group, the Loyalist Volunteer Force, as
they fired a volley of shots into the air from handguns. The lead
masked figure read out a defiant speech, signing off with the
Protestants' rallying cry: ''No surrender!''
</P>
<P>
   Both the UDA and LVF are supposed to be observing cease-fires.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's demonstration was the first time the two anti-Catholic
groups had demonstrated such a close alliance in public, a sign
that extremists are taking a more coordinated approach to this
year's violence.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, police set up a phone hot line to advise motorists
what areas to avoid. As darkness fell, Belfast's streets were
largely deserted.
</P>
<P>
   Protestants ran onto roadways to block cars in several places.
Those who didn't stop risked having their car pelted with missiles
and stolen.
</P>
<P>
   In predominantly east Belfast, two cars that had recently been
hijacked were already ablaze and sending plumes of black smoke into
the night sky.
</P>
<P>
   In Portadown, several hundred Protestants massed near the rows
of riot police and armored cars blocking the path toward Garvaghy
Road, fanning out into the cow pastures flanking the Drumcree
church to throw firecrackers and gasoline bombs at police lines.
</P>
<P>
   In response, police deployed two Belgian-designed armored cars
equipped with water cannons. One doused the lead ranks of rioters,
forcing them back up the hill toward the church.
</P>
<P>
   Police reported that protesters had blocked key roads in at
least six other towns in Northern Ireland.

<HEADLINE> Town Pitches To Replace Amish Horse  </HEADLINE>
By MEGAN K. STACK
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEEVILLE, Texas (AP) -- There were double takes on Washington
Street when the Borntrager family clopped by in their horse-drawn
buggy. There were bemused glances when they peddled sweet corn,
quilts and jellies on the courthouse square.
</P>
<P>
   The Amish family turned quite a few heads when they settled in
this south Texas town of 18,000, a community of ranchers between
San Antonio and Corpus Christi.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it was strange, just like everybody else,'' said
Danny Madrigal, a sheriff's inspector. ''It's unusual, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   But Beeville has offered Texas-sized comfort to the Borntragers
following a stunning and disturbing tragedy: The family's two
Haflinger carriage horses were attacked in May, riddled with
bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Four teen-aged boys told investigators they thought they were
shooting at wild hogs when they killed Leroy Borntrager's mare and
injured his stallion.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe guilt lingers long in a town that prides itself on
neighborly ways. Perhaps it's the suffering of the animals.
Whatever the reason, Beeville wants to make amends by replacing the
mare.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all just kind of looked at each other and said, 'We've got
to do something,''' Pat Finch said. ''It was just a senseless,
terrible act.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, Finch points out, the animals meant just about
everything to the Borntragers: Family pet, transportation,
financial asset. Beeville's former cowboys certainly know how the
importance of horses.
</P>
<P>
   As manager of a corner shop, Wicker Basket, Finch usually
oversees a quiet realm of candles, knickknacks and coffee klatches.
Now the phone is jangling and Finch is jotting figures. The shop
has become the epicenter of the cash drive.
</P>
<P>
   The bill for the horse, including shipping from Tennessee, will
run about $4,100. The town has raised more than half the money.
</P>
<P>
   Donations are mostly drummed up by word of mouth. Checks are
mailed or dropped by the shop. A little boy chipped in $20, a
month's allowance, Finch said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's shameful,'' gas station attendant Michelle Clark said
quietly, color rising in her cheeks. ''For those people to come
make a life in our town and then have that happen -- it's just
awful.''
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, the town trod lightly. Before raising a
penny, a liaison -- Finch shied away from saying who -- dropped by to
clear the fund-raising plan with the Borntragers.
</P>
<P>
   To see how gently the town is handling the reclusive family,
just try to find them: Most everybody knows where the Borntragers
make their home, but mum is the word. The media-shy family asked
the sheriff's department to remove trespassing reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are very, very private people,'' said Brenda Wooden,
seated beneath Wicker Basket's revolving fans on a sweltering
afternoon. ''And we respect that.''
</P>
<P>
   The shootings did not stem from anti-Amish sentiment, sheriff's
investigators concluded. The teen-agers, ages 15 to 17, were
charged with criminal mischief for opening fire on the animals.
</P>
<P>
   The teens told investigators they came across the horses while
bumping along back roads in a pickup truck during a midnight hog
hunting spree. Squinting into the darkness, they mistook the horses
for wild pigs, the teens said. The horses, tied up to stakes at the
edge of a corn field, were pelted with dozens of bullets from a
rifle and a shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   The stout brown mare, who was pregnant, was found dead on her
side May 30. The stallion was pacing wildly, its legs dotted with
bullet wounds. After days in a veterinary hospital, it is
recovering.
</P>
<P>
   The teens were put on probation until their 18th birthdays. They
faced two years in jail and a $10,000 fine, but Borntrager declined
to press criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're forgiving,'' Madrigal said. ''If anything, they're a
little worried about the boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting Beeville to forget could prove tougher.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those kids are going to carry that cross for a long time,''
Madrigal said. ''It's not that big a town -- things get around.''

<HEADLINE> China Dissident Sent To Labor Camp  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Chinese police have sentenced a member of an
outlawed would-be opposition party to three years in a labor camp,
apparently for demanding the release of a fellow dissident, a human
rights group reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Police in Shanghai arrested Li Guotao on June 13, four days
after he and 22 others wrote to the city's mayor appealing for the
release of Dai Xuezhong, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of
Human Rights and Democracy said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Li, a 42-year-old computer technician, was sentenced
to three years in a labor camp, the longest term possible under
Chinese law without a trial, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   Police found Li guilty of ''disturbing the social order'' for
appealing on behalf of someone accused of plotting to steal mobile
phones, the group said. Dai Xuezhong was convicted of assault, but
his brother Dai Xuewu was arrested in March on charges of stealing
mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
   Police have in recent years increasingly used common criminal
charges to persecute political dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   Li and Dai Xuezhong were members of the China Democracy Party,
set up by dissidents two years ago to challenge the ruling
Communist Party's political monopoly. Soon thereafter, authorities
cracked down, harassing and arresting party members. Its leaders
have been given jail terms of up to 13 years.

<HEADLINE> Largest teachers' union considers step toward bonus systems  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) - The nation's largest teachers' union is
considering accepting the increasingly popular view that teachers'
pay should be linked to how well they have been teaching, instead
of how long.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 10,000 delegates to the National Education Association
meeting here will decide on Wednesday what local units should do
when school boards propose bonus-pay plans in collective
bargaining. This marks the first time the NEA has formally
considered the divisive bonus-pay issue at its annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Bonus-pay critics, who are expected to heat up the debate,
reject such plans as arbitrary and unfair to teachers who have
unusually difficult students. Backers, which include some state
union leaders, say rewarding good teachers would bring the
profession respect, top-notch candidates and higher salaries for
all.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what's going to happen, but it's going to be a
good debate and it's going to be a close debate,'' NEA President
Bob Chase said in an interview on the eve of the vote. ''The fact
is a lot of our local associations have been willing to look at
alternative pay schedules on top of existing plans.''
</P>
<P>
   A handful of states offer rewards that teachers can use for
computers or training, although not for their own pay. But recent
demands by business leaders and politicians for higher standards
often include calls for teacher cash incentives. Some form of
reward has even been proposed by the two leading presidential
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pay-for-performance'' plans usually give teachers higher
salaries or bonuses if they're judged to be good at what they do,
accept extra or difficult assignments, mentor others on how to
become more effective, or more controversially, have students who
score higher on tests.
</P>
<P>
   Many teachers say that's unfair if they have students suffering
from abuse, neglect or other ills that they can't affect or
control. But some, such as New York Mayor Rudolph Guiliani, still
propose bonuses based on test scores. Cincinnati last month became
the first public district to replace its pay-by-seniority scale
with pay based on performance.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to be ready to deal with that,'' Chase said of the
NEA.
</P>
<P>
   The key proposal before the delegates would allow the national
group to at least help local units do the research needed to decide
whether to accept a plan in a contract.
</P>
<P>
   In some views, the NEA, representing more than half of the
nation's 3.1 million teachers, is taking baby steps. Supporters of
stronger plans - some of which tie student test scores to teacher
pay - blame low teacher salaries on union contracts that base pay
on how many years a teacher has spent in the classroom or whether
he or she has a master's degree.
</P>
<P>
   ''Engineers and computer scientists who cannot do the job are
usually let go, while the successful ones earn high salaries,''
said Lissette Bishins, spokeswoman for the Center for Education
Reform. ''This is not the case for teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   John McDonald, a Dearborn, Mich., college professor and local
president of organized higher-education faculty there, says
contracts also must protect the employee. ''Tenure does not grant
job protection for the incompetent. We do want people to have a
fair shake.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, teachers have been wary of reward systems,
fearing that a principal may keep fattening the paycheck of a
favored teacher or dock teachers each time a child brings home a
''D.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Can you imagine paying a doctor by who she saved or who he
saved?'' said Randi Weingarten, president of the New York
Federation of Teachers. ''Who would an oncologist see?''
</P>
<P>
   She said raising base pay to attract better teachers is the
answer: ''We need to say to prospective hires, 'You can make a
living wage. This is not missionary work.'''
</P>
<P>
   A report released Tuesday by the 1 million-member American
Federation of Teachers said teachers still get paid less than other
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1998-99 school year, the average teacher made $40,574.
The union compared that with the average pay in 1999 for other
white-collar jobs: engineers earned $68,294 on average; computer
systems analysts, $66,782; lawyers, $69,104.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Hospitals Brace For Strike  </HEADLINE>
By JESSIE SEYFER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Ten northern California hospitals are
bracing for a planned one-day strike by thousands of workers who
say they are so underpaid and overworked that patient care is being
jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
   The threatened walk-off comes at a tough time for area
hospitals: 1,730 nurses at two Stanford hospitals are in their
fourth week of a strike and five anesthesiologists at an Oakland
hospital resigned last week in a dispute over pay and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed Thursday strike by about 4,000 receptionists, food
service workers, nursing assistants and respiratory therapists has
forced some hospitals -- five Sutter Health hospitals, three
Catholic Healthcare West hospitals and two independent facilities --
to cut some services, particularly elective procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the nurses' strike affecting the other hospitals, the
fact that the union would target 10 more hospitals just confounds
me,'' said Bill Gleeson, a spokesman for Sacramento-based Sutter
Health. ''They're abandoning patients for a picnic and parade.
That's not just uncaring and reckless, it's tragic.''
</P>
<P>
   The hospital workers, represented by the Service Employees
International Union Local 250, claim the one-day strike is no more
reckless than the reduced patient care that has resulted from years
of mergers, staff cutbacks and profit-seeking by the hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ''Staffing has decreased dramatically over the years. Their
normal operation is to eliminate departments and lay off staff.
It's all about money to them,'' said Local 250 President Sal
Rosselli. ''That's the real danger to patient care.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutter Health and Catholic Healthcare West officials said the
unions are unfairly demanding lifetime job security, but the union
said its chief aim is to give its employees a voice in staffing
decisions.

<HEADLINE> N.H. Court Crisis Nears Key Day  </HEADLINE>
By GENE JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- After two months of interviews and
testimony, lawmakers were prepared to decide whether three New
Hampshire Supreme Court justices should be impeached over alleged
ethics violations.
</P>
<P>
   The way the vote will go ''depends on who you ask,'' Henry Mock,
chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said Tuesday. ''It's
like a roller coaster.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee must decide to recommend whether Chief Justice
David Brock and Justices Sherman Horton and John Broderick should
be impeached, reprimanded or cleared.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was expected Wednesday. The House is scheduled to vote
on the committee's recommendation later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Brock, the chief justice since 1986, is accused of intervening
with a lower court judge in a case involving a state senator
because the senator could help win pay raises for the bench -- a
charge Brock denies.
</P>
<P>
   The committee will also decide if Brock placed the court's
confidentiality above the need to report misconduct by other
justices.
</P>
<P>
   He is also implicated in former Justice Stephen Thayer's attempt
to influence his own divorce case and accused of failing to
promptly report other alleged incidents of misconduct by Thayer,
who resigned when the scandal broke in March.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's work began in April, after Attorney General
Philip McLaughlin said that while investigating Thayer he came
across ethics violations by the rest of the court.
</P>
<P>
   Most disturbing, McLaughlin said, was that Brock fostered an
atmosphere in which judges who had conflicts of interest in cases
were allowed to take part in discussions about them.
</P>
<P>
   In public testimony before the committee last month, Brock
apologized for his poor judgment, but said he meant no harm. He
said he knew immediately that Thayer acted inappropriately, and he
believed he was reacting to a sensitive situation in the best
possible way.
</P>
<P>
   The committee had to decide whether Brock's judgment rises to
the level of an impeachable offense, defined in the state
Constitution as corruption, bribery, malpractice or
maladministration of office.
</P>
<P>
   Horton and Broderick also have been sharply criticized by
lawmakers for their handling of Thayer's misconduct and their
failure to completely disqualify themselves from cases in which
they had conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Mock said the case has burdened lawmakers.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Hog Virus Resurfaces  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Health authorities put eight hog
farms in eastern Malaysia under quarantine after tests showed some
pigs could be infected with a virus that killed more than 100
people last year, news reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery in Sarawak state on Borneo island came during
routine blood tests on pigs, agricultural official David Teng Lung
Chi told The Sun daily.
</P>
<P>
   Such tests were ordered after last year's outbreak of Nipah
virus that destroyed pig farms across Malaysia, the region's
largest pork producer. Nearly 1 million pigs had to be killed to
contain the deadly new strain of viral encephalitis.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, authorities ordered the killing of 1,700 pigs in
northern Penang state to prevent a recurrence of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Any hog farm found with even one infected pig must destroy its
entire stock. Owners of the farms in Sarawak were barred Tuesday
from transporting pigs anywhere until investigations were
completed.

<HEADLINE> Russia Launches Military Satellite  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- A Proton-K booster launched a Russian Cosmos
military satellite into orbit early Wednesday from the Baikonur
cosmodrome in Kazakstan.
</P>
<P>
   The booster is the same one to be used to launch the
Russian-built Zvezda living module for the International Space
Station next week.
</P>
<P>
   Two failed Proton launches last year raised concerns about the
rocket's reliability. Space officials say they have fixed a problem
with the second-stage engines, and there have been several
successful Proton launches this year.
</P>
<P>
   The failures contributed to delays in launching Zvezda, which is
more than two years behind schedule.

<HEADLINE> Through the mist ... OpSail 2000 comes into focus  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Like pages of a history book sprung to life,
towering tall ships with crisp white sails and crews in formation
glided through New York Harbor as OpSail 2000 marked a very special
Fourth of July.
</P>
<P>
   Spectators came from across the city and around the world for a
rare look at the floating parade, which included two dozen warships
from 14 countries in only the sixth International Naval Review in
history.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, standing on the flight deck of the USS John
F. Kennedy, was among those impressed by the 11-mile line of
seafaring craft of all sizes and shapes. The ships sailed into
sight with the Statue of Liberty as a backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   At night, 150 tons of explosives fueled the nation's most
spectacular fireworks display. The rockets' red-white-and-blue
glare exploded in an extravaganza that lit up the sky all around
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Sail marked the first return of the tall ships to New
York since 1992's 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus'
journey. The 26 Class-A sailing ships, those measuring over 160
feet, came from 19 countries.
</P>
<P>
   They had miles of canvas, but inconsistent breezes and tight
maneuvering space forced them to use their engines. More than 100
smaller wind-powered vessels also were part of the parade of sail.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Nelson came to Battery Park from the Bronx with her
10-year-old son, Michael, who was buying an OpSail T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very excited,'' she said moments after a Stealth fighter
buzzed overhead as part of the festivities. ''This is the closest
I've ever been to a Stealth fighter. It's very interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Samuel Johnson, of Brooklyn, wielded his videocamera
over the heads of spectators standing 20-deep in Battery Park. They
watched as the extraordinary water show was led by the Coast Guard
barque Eagle - a craft seized from the Nazis after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's beautiful,'' Johnson enthusiastically said. ''It's a
wonderful scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Up at Riverbank State Park in Harlem, the crowd stretched across
ten blocks. The parade took nearly two hours to reach the park. But
spectators said it was worth the wait.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're beautiful ships,'' said Lawrence Gibson, 78, a retiree
from the Bronx. ''It's the first time I've seen anything like this.
... I'm used to seeing these ships just in books.''
</P>
<P>
   The tall ships, drawing the biggest oohs and aahs, led the
floating parade beneath the Verrazano Bridge, emerging as if beamed
in via time machine through a morning harbor haze.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton delivered a message of good will after the ships headed
north on the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our ancestors came here on immigrant ships and slave ships,''
Clinton reminded his audience, calling for acceptance of immigrants
and people of color. ''We must resolve never to close the golden
door behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   He also announced that America's next generation of destroyers
would be named for late Adm. Elmo Zumwalt Jr., architect of the
modern U.S. Navy. Clinton called Zumwalt, who died in January at
age 79, ''my mentor, my friend and a magnificent role model.''
</P>
<P>
   About halfway through the naval review, the gray clouds and haze
vanished, giving Clinton a better view of Ellis Island, the Statue
of Liberty and the New York skyline. More than 10,000 U.S. and
foreign sailors participated in the review, many standing at
attention on the decks of their ships and saluting Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Crew members on a Canadian frigate, The Ville de Quebec, not
only took off their hats and shouted ''hip hip hooray,'' but
blasted a rendition of the song ''New York, New York'' from their
loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
   The president was accompanied by first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton and daughter Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's perch aboard the Kennedy was fitting, since President
John F. Kennedy established Operation Sail in 1961 to promote
international relations and cultural affairs.
</P>
<P>
   OpSail in the past has organized events to mark the 1964 World's
Fair, the 1976 U.S. Bicentennial, and the centennial of the Statue
of Liberty in 1986. This year, OpSail coincided with an
International Naval Review, a gathering of warships first held in
1893.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's crowd, which stretched north from New York Harbor to
the George Washington Bridge, appeared far less than the four
million people expected along the route.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was billed as the largest peacetime gathering of
ships in U.S. history, the pre-parade estimate of 70,000 crafts
never turned up. The Coast Guard put the number of boats along the
route at about 30,000.

<HEADLINE> Medical Mistakes Data Said Flawed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A 1999 report that said medical mistakes kill as
many as 98,000 hospitalized Americans each year used flawed
methodology and is greatly exaggerated, researchers reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the Indiana University School of Medicine said
they suspect the death toll from errors is in fact very small and
called the parts of the November report from the Institute of
Medicine ''hot and shrill.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, the researchers said, never established that medical
errors caused the deaths and failed to eliminate other risks for
sick patients before drawing conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The available data do not support IOM's claim of large numbers
of deaths caused by adverse events, (preventable or otherwise),''
wrote Clement J. McDonald and two Indiana colleagues in the Journal
of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   In a rebuttal article, Dr. Lucian L. Leape, of the Harvard
School of Public Health, argued that the IOM report is accurate.
Leape co-authored the IOM report and conducted some of the research
upon which it is based.
</P>
<P>
   The groundbreaking report said medical errors kill anywhere from
44,000 to 98,000 hospitalized Americans each year and called for
major changes in the nation's health care system to protect
patients.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the problem isn't recklessness by doctors or
nurses as much as it is the result of flaws in the way hospitals,
clinics and pharmacies operate. After the report, President Clinton
said hospitals should agree to routine reporting of serious and
deadly mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's rebuttal, Leape said his report may have actually
underestimated the extent of the problem because many errors are
never recorded in the medical record. Also, the report did not
examine injuries outside the hospital. More than half of surgical
procedures take place outside of a hospital setting, Leape wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Leape defended the report's research methodology, saying
screening criteria eliminated patients who were extremely ill or
had complicated conditions. He said the patients were not as ill as
the Indiana researchers implied and likely would have lived if not
for the mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The IOM report has galvanized a national movement to improve
patient safety,'' Leape writes. ''It is about time.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their differences, the Indiana researchers said they
agreed with the report's call to understand the cause of medical
errors and for the development of mechanisms to reduce error rates.

<HEADLINE> Bond Star Is Now Sir Sean Connery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) -- The name is Sean. Sir Sean.
</P>
<P>
   Decked out in full Scottish regalia, Sean Connery was formally
knighted Wednesday by Queen Elizabeth II in a ceremony at the
Palace of Holyroodhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's one of the proudest days of my life,'' the star of seven
James Bond films told reporters, accompanied by his wife,
Micheline, and brother, Neil.
</P>
<P>
   Connery, 69, knelt while the queen touched his shoulders lightly
with a sword and then rose and bowed as she placed a small red sash
bearing his medal around his neck.
</P>
<P>
   During the brief conversation that ensued, Connery said, ''She
just asked how often I come up here.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Connery is a native of Scotland and bears a tattoo
proclaiming ''Scotland Forever,'' he does not reside here.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by a reporter Wednesday if he would be coming back to
Scotland, he broke into a grin and said, ''I haven't gone yet.''

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices are mixed in early trading, weighed
down by weakness in technology issues. The Dow Jones industrial
average is up two points in today's early going. Advancing issues
on the New York Stock Exchange hold a slim lead over decliners.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index is off more than 50 points and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Stock Index is down nearly two points.
</P>
<P>
   The stock futures headed lower about an hour before the opening
bell, when BMC Software announced an earnings shortfall. That,
along with a warning issued by Computer Associates and Centura
Banks is reminding investors that a slowing economy may put a
damper on earnings.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly lower Wednesday, with
technology stocks leading the decline after Computer Associates
became the latest company to warn that profits won't meet
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   In morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 23.07 at 10,537.60.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was down 11.94 at 1,457.38, and the Nasdaq composite
index was down 73.53 at 3,918.40.
</P>
<P>
   Computer Associates plummeted $21.938 to $29.188, a 43 percent
drop. Shortly after midnight Tuesday, the company surprised Wall
Street analysts by warning that its fiscal first-quarter results
would badly miss expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The warning raised fears that other technology companies will
also issue disappointing results when the earnings reporting season
goes into full gear later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, BMC Software said Wednesday morning that fiscal
first-quarter earnings will be 18 to 21 cents a share, compared
with analysts' consensus of 46 cents. Its shares fell $12.813 to
$22.688 on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   ''The damage is fairly well concentrated in the technology
stocks,'' said William Meehan, chief market analyst for Cantor
Fitzgerald. ''It's feeding on itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the largest technology companies fell prey to investors'
worries about earnings. IBM fell $5.50 to $104.375 and Intel fell
$4.063 to $132.813.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Oracle fell $5 to $75.188 after J.P. Morgan analyst
William Epifanio downgraded the stock to ''market performer'' from
''buy.'' Epifanio cited concerns over Oracle's plan for management
succession after president and chief operating officer Ray Lane
stepped down last week.
</P>
<P>
   Oil stocks were also lower in the first trading session since
Saudi Arabia signaled it may soon begin producing an additional
half-million barrels a day. The Saudis said in a statement Monday
they will provide higher production within a few days if crude
prices don't quickly head lower toward their preferred price of
about $25 a barrel.

   Exxon Mobil fell $2.547 to $77.

<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a slender margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 309.82 million
shares, compared with 213.35 million shares at the same time
Monday. The stock market was closed on Tuesday for the Independence

<HEADLINE> Text of Clinton Announcement  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Remarks by President Clinton at a White House press
conference
Wednesday, as transcribed by eMediaMillWorks Inc.:
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLINTON: Good morning. Early next week Prime Minister Barak and
Chairman Arafat will come to Camp David. A few days before that,
their negotiators will arrive to help pave the way for this summit.
The objective is to reach an agreement on the core issues that have
fueled a half-century of conflict between Israelis and
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   After a lengthy discussion with the two leaders and after
listening to Secretary Albright's report, I have concluded that
this is the best way, indeed, it is the only way, to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   To state the task is to suggest the magnitude of the challenge.
Behind the Israeli-Palestinian conflict lie the most profound
questions about beliefs, political identity, collective fate.
Etched in each side's mind are intense fears and emotions and a
deep-seated commitment to defend their people's interests. There
are no easy answers and certainly no painless ones, and, therefore,
there is clearly no guarantee of success.
</P>
<P>
   Why this summit and why now? While Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators have made real progress, crystallizing issues and
defining gaps, the truth is they can take the talks no further at
their level. Significant differences remain, and they involved the
most complex and most sensitive of questions.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators have reached an impasse. Movement now depends on
historic decisions that only the two leaders can make. I will be
there with them, and I intend to do all I can to help them in this
endeavor. But to delay this gathering, to remain stalled, is simply
no longer an option, for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as all
of us have seen, knows no status quo. It can move forward towards
real peace or it can slide back into turmoil. It will not stand
still.
</P>
<P>
   If the parties do not seize this moment, if they cannot make
progress now, there will be more hostility and more bitterness,
perhaps even more violence. And to what end? Eventually, after more
bloodshed and tears, they will have to come back to the negotiating
table, they will have to return to face the same history, the same
geography, the same demographic trends, the same passions and the
same hatreds, and, I am sure, the exact same choices that confront
them here and now.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, action does have its perils, but so too does
inaction.
</P>
<P>
   The decisions will not come easier with time. Fundamentally,
that is what I have concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders have to make the decisions that are still there to
be made, and the longer we wait the more difficult the decisions
are likely to become. The Israeli and the Palestinian people have
leaders now who are visionary enough, courageous enough, capable of
building a fair, just and lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
   Coming here and accepting this challenge, Prime Minister Barak
and Chairman Arafat have shown they are ready to take risk to
pursue peace. The rest of the world, and especially the rest of the
region, cannot afford to be bystanders. For all those who are truly
committed to the cause of peace and to the well-being of the
Israeli and Palestinian people, now is the time to lend their
support to the peacemakers.
</P>
<P>
   To the people of Israel and to the Palestinian people, I would
like to say this: Peace under circumstances like these is never
cost-free.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side can achieve 100 percent of its goals. For the
optimal solution of each party is by definition one the other party
cannot and will not accept. Negotiations, therefore, must create an
outcome that is realistic, balanced and fair, and that meets the
fundamental objectives of both sides, an outcome that strengthens
the two parties rather than weakens one of them, an outcome that
accommodates both sides' vital needs and dreams, an outcome that
reconciles their competing grievances. That is the only outcome
that will permit Israelis and Palestinians to offer their children
a future far different from the past, one with more opportunity and
less fear, more hope and less despair. And that, of course, is the
ultimate prize of peace.
</P>
<P>
   The objective is often overshadowed, I might say, as all of you
know, by the abject dreariness of the pursuit, one that you will no
doubt have occasion to comment on in the days ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The ups and down of the process, the daily hassles and disputes,
the open-ended nature of the negotiations--all these over time have
blurred the vision of what it is we are trying to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   For Prime Minister Barak and Chairman Arafat, the challenge next
week will be to start drawing the contours of the long-awaited
peace, a peace that can fulfill the Israeli people's quest for
security, for recognition, for genuine reconciliation with
Palestinians and genuine acceptance in the region, acceptance in
deeds as well as words; a peace that can fulfill the Palestinian
people's legitimate aspirations to determine their destiny on their
own land and to build a better future.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON: Almost seven years ago now we witnessed the historic
handshake between the late Prime Minister Rabin and Chairman
Arafat. It began a process that offered the Israeli and Palestinian
people the chance to achieve what I then described as the quiet
miracle of a normal life. That is still the vision that must
inspire the efforts and call forth the commitment, courage and
creativity of Prime Minister Barak and Chairman Arafat next week.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Mr. President, do you think that this is the last opportunity
for peace during your presidency? And how long will you give these
negotiations?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you talking days, weeks, what?
</P>
<P>
   C: Well, the answer to the first--actually, the short answer to
both questions is, I don't know. I'll tell you what I do know. I
know that Prime Minister Barak strongly believes that the nature of
this process is such that the final decisions cannot be made except
by meeting between the two leaders and that he cannot go further
than he has gone without that sort of meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Arafat understands that the nature of the process is
such that the final decisions will have to be made by the two
leaders, and so they're willing to give it their best shot and they
understand, too, that, as we have already seen, delay tends to make
these things worse, not better.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important judgments any political leader has to
make when dealing with a thorny problem is whether delay will make
it better or worse. And occasionally, you actually get problems
where the best thing to do right now is nothing; that delay will
actually cause them to become less severe. These are not such
problems. Delays only seems to me to make them more severe.
</P>
<P>
   C: So that's the answer to the first question.
</P>
<P>
   The second question is, we all know what the deal is, we know
what the issues are. We know at least within a range what the
options are. I think if we work hard, we can get it done in several
days. But I will give it what ever time is required as long as
we're still moving forward.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Mr. President, could you describe the extent of your
participation? Are you going to move up to Camp David lock, stock
and barrel for as long as it takes? And are you going to present a
U.S.--maybe a model plan that might bring these two sides together?
</P>
<P>
   C: Well, I think that the less I say right now about what I'm
going to do, the better. And I will spend as much time there as I
need to spend. You know, I may come back here from time to time,
depending on what else is happening, what else I need to do. We've
got a lot going on in Congress now, even though they will be gone a
lot, some of the time perhaps. But I think they will be here most
of the time we'll be here, and I may have to come back.
</P>
<P>
   So we'll just see. But I will be there a lot, and I'll work as
hard as I need to work.
</P>
<P>
   Q: ...the deadline in September--how important is that deadline?
</P>
<P>
   C: Well, it's a deadline they set for themselves. And I think
they all see it in terms that are--both sides see it in terms that
are different from the deadline they set for the framework
agreement. That is, they knew that there were--that there were
problems inherent in making the framework agreement that if they
could overcome, they could make the final agreement consistent with
the framework agreement.
</P>
<P>
   So that's one of the things, obviously, that has driven my
decision here. I think that neither of them really want to see us
go by September without a resolution of this. And I think they
understand the stakes here.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Mr. President, can you talk about the symbolism of the
location of Camp David, what impact at all it might have on the
parties to help them bridge this--close gaps between them?
</P>
<P>
   C: Well, it is a place where, obviously, a milestone in the
Middle East peace was reached, and I hope--in that sense, I think it
has to be a positive environment.
</P>
<P>
   But I think they also realize that from the very beginning these
were the hardest questions. They go to the core of both sides
identity and sense of themselves. Far more difficult to resolve,
with all respect, than any issues between Israel and the Egyptians
or the Jordanians or even the Syrians, although we're not there yet
with the Syrians. Everybody knows pretty much what the deal is
there and that there are practical questions there that are not
nearly so charged with emotion and identity and almost national
consciousness as these are. So these are the difficult ones.
</P>
<P>
   And obviously I hope that the setting will help to inspire them
and to inspire us. I hope we'll all be inspired by it.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also a great place for us to be because it gives a
reasonable chance to work in quiet and without interruption and to
observe the necessary discretion, without which we won't be able to
move forward.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you.
</P>
<P>
   Q: ... the Mexican elections, please.
</P>
<P>
   C: Well, I called President Zedillo and congratulated him on
what was clearly an open and fair and well-fought election.
</P>
<P>
   And I called President-elect Fox and congratulated him on his
victory. We talked a little bit about the importance of our
relationship and what lies ahead. And I told him that he would be
welcome here at any time if he would come up.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously he has a lot of things to do, and he'll have to make
that decision. But I'd be happy to meet with him if he would like
to come up and sort of get our relationship started.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his term will unfold with the next president. But the
relationship that we have with Mexico needs to go beyond individual
personalities always, because we have too much in common and too
much of a future to build together.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you.

<HEADLINE> Court May Hear Disabled Golfer Case  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The PGA Tour wants the Supreme Court to rule
that disabled golfer Casey Martin has no legal right to ride in a
golf cart between shots during its tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   In an appeal filed with the nation's highest court Wednesday,
lawyers for PGA Tour Inc. argued that a federal anti-bias law, the
Americans with Disabilities Act, should not apply to Martin's case.
</P>
<P>
   The ADA does not regulate ''standards established for
competitors (here, professional golfers) in athletic competitions
held at places of public accommodation,'' the appeal said.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
previously rejected that argument, allowing Martin to use a cart in
PGA Tour-sanctioned events.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court, now in summer recess, is not expected to say
until October whether it will grant the PGA Tour's appeal and hear
arguments in the case. If it denies review, the lower courts'
rulings will stand.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who sued the PGA Tour in 1997, has a circulatory
disorder in his right leg that makes it painful for him to walk
long distances. The disorder, a congenital vascular condition, is
called Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber Syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Tour's appeal also argued that the ADA was never meant
to require professional sports organizations to waive competitive
rules for disabled competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ''So far as we are aware, no court has ever before held that a
professional sport must waive a legitimate competitive rule to
enable a would-be participant, disabled or not, to more
successfully compete,'' the appeal said.
</P>
<P>
   In ruling for Martin last March, the 9th Circuit court relied on
a provision in the ADA that bans discrimination on the basis of
disability ''in the full enjoyment of ... facilities ... of any
place of public accommodation.''
</P>
<P>
   The law's definition of public accommodation includes places of
exercise and recreation, including golf courses.
</P>
<P>
   The case is PGA Tour v. Martin, 00-24.

<HEADLINE> Musician Forms Own Record Label  </HEADLINE>
By ERIC FIDLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- When Alison Brown says her music label, Compass
Records, represents the triumph of art over commerce, she is
uniquely qualified to talk about both.
</P>
<P>
   She's a record company executive, MBA, former investment banker,
guitarist, banjo player, band leader (the Alison Brown Quartet) and
band member (New Grange).
</P>
<P>
   Her new album, ''Fair Weather,'' is a return to her bluegrass
roots after a period in which she veered into jazz. Oh, and she was
pre-med at Harvard University before the specter of organic
chemistry convinced her that her future lay elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ''I decided to go to business school because I had this notion
that there was some way to combine business with my interest in
music,'' she says by phone from her Nashville office.
</P>
<P>
   There sure was.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Brown started Compass, which she runs with her husband
and bass player, Garry West, from ''a little pink cottage a safe
distance from Music Row'' in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Compass has turned into one of the more interesting small
labels. It has released jazz, pop, rock and country albums, and
now, with ''Fair Weather,'' bluegrass.
</P>
<P>
   But before Compass, Brown spent two years in the public finance
division of Smith Barney in San Francisco, followed by three years
touring as the banjo player in bluegrass sensation Alison Krauss'
band.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a circuitous path,'' she says, in something of an
understatement.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, now 37, took guitar lessons as a child in Connecticut,
but her world turned when she heard a Flatt &AMP; Scruggs album for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   ''What amazing stuff. I just loved the sound of the banjo,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   At 10 she started taking banjo lessons. At 12, her family moved
to San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Far from the hollows of Appalachia where the music was born, San
Diego had a thriving bluegrass scene. At its epicenter was a
Shakey's pizzeria where the city's bluegrass club met.
</P>
<P>
   There Brown met other young musicians, including Vince Gill, who
went on to country music stardom, and Stuart Duncan, now probably
the most sought-after fiddle player in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was so much going on. It's surprising to a lot of folks
that bluegrass is so popular in Southern California. I think it has
something to do with the migration of people from the Dust Bowl,''
Brown says.
</P>
<P>
   Brown and Duncan recorded an album while she was in high school,
but she wasn't thinking of music as a career.
</P>
<P>
   ''My parents always encouraged me to think of music as an
avocation,'' she says. ''I was supposed to go to med school.''
</P>
<P>
   After giving up the idea of a career in medicine, Brown turned
to business.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even when I left Smith Barney my thought was to take a little
time off and then rewrite my resume and go out and find another
corporate job. If Alison Krauss hadn't called and offered me a gig
with her band, that's what I would have done,'' Brown says.
</P>
<P>
   After playing with Krauss, Brown joined Michelle Shocked's band.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's when my horizons broadened,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ''Growing up, I listened to mostly bluegrass, to the point that
a lot of the pop hits from the '70s and '80s that everybody else
knows, I really don't,'' she says. ''My dad played classical music
and (jazz guitarist) Joe Pass. The other stuff came from working
with Michelle and then Garry West.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I'm playing just for fun it's as likely to be some jazz
standard or some Wes Montgomery tune that I'm working on.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Marshall, who plays mandolin with Brown in New Grange,
calls her ''one of the great banjo players of our time.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a beautiful calmness in her playing while burning your
face off. She just stands there politely like a lady and rips it to
shreds,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's eclecticism shows in Compass' roster of more than 40
artists, which includes New Orleans' venerable jazz band Astral
Project, British pop goddess Eddi Reader, folk-rockers Bill
Mallonee and Vigilantes of Love and Congolese guitarist Samba Ngo.
</P>
<P>
   ''The common unifying thread I guess is our taste. We don't put
out any music that we don't really love. It's sort of art over
commerce in that sense,'' Brown says.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think of the audience for Compass Records as being people
who listen to National Public Radio and have a sense that there's
music out there that they would really like but they just don't
know where to turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown seems to enjoy juggling the demands of art and commerce,
but says she starts each week feeling as if she's two days behind.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think about Nathaniel Hawthorne working at the customs house
in Salem, Mass., and still having time to write,'' she says, a
touch wistfully.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall isn't sure how she does it.
</P>
<P>
   ''To play the capitalist music game and yet still deal with
playing her instrument, it's defying gravity,'' he says.

   ''Summer in the City'' (Manticore/Sony Classical) -- Joe Jackson
</P>
<P>
   Given Joe Jackson's musical evolution from new wave singer and
big band jazzbo to last year's classical-minded composer of
''Symphony No. 1,'' it's no surprise that ''Summer in the City,''
recorded live in New York in 1999, shows what a comfortably
versatile performer Jackson is. With bassist Graham Maby, drummer
Gary Burke and Jackson on piano, the trio kicks off with the Lovin'
Spoonful title track and proceeds to give a concert of favored
originals and cover treats.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fools in Love'' is a medley with the Yardbirds' ''For Your
Love.'' Other delights include a bare ''Eleanor Rigby,'' Duke
Ellington's ''Mood Indigo'' and Steely Dan's ''King of the World.''
From Jackson's own pantry are seasoned versions of ''Obvious Song''
and ''It's Different for Girls.'' ''One More Time'' is resurrected
from his 1979 ''Look Sharp!'' album.
</P>
<P>
   ''Summer in the City'' shows how a career-spanning live album
can breathe new life into past achievements. Joe Jackson's
forthcoming album, ''Night and Day II,'' is expected this fall.

   ''Red Headed Stranger'' (Columbia/Legacy) -- Willie Nelson
</P>
<P>
   When it was released in 1975, Willie Nelson's ''Red Headed
Stranger'' was a shot across Nashville's bow, a revolutionary
manifesto and one great album. Today, rereleased in digital glory
and beefed up with bonus cuts as part of Sony's American Milestones
series, it remains as fresh and wonderful as it was 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Red Headed Stranger'' is a concept album about a preacher who
returns home to find that his wife has left him. The songs and
arrangements are simple, but cut right to the heart, which is
probably why the album was a platinum seller. While it's mighty
hard to pick a favorite Willie Nelson album, this one would top a
lot of lists.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson is perhaps underrated as a singer, but he deserves to be
considered one of the best. Listen to his reedy voice turn the
simple ''Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain'' into a devastating tale of
regret and notice the way he sometimes hovers behind the beat,
milking every bit of nuance -- and emotion -- out of the songs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Red Headed Stranger'' is an enduring classic, testament to the
staying power of popular music when it works both as entertainment
and art.

   ''Can the Circle Be Unbroken'' (Columbia/Legacy) -- The Original
Carter Family
</P>
<P>
   Was there music before the Carter Family and Jimmie Rodgers?
Well, there wasn't country music as we know it today, with harmony
vocals and a lead guitar. They pretty much invented it, starting in
the late 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   This album, most of which was recorded over a week in 1935,
catches the ''first family of country music'' at the height of its
powers. Many of these songs -- including such well-known gems as the
title cut, ''Keep on the Sunny Side'' and ''Wildwood Flower'' -- are
still performed today, not out of nostalgia but because they still
work.
</P>
<P>
   The same can be said of the songs as performed by the Carter
Family. This album, part of Sony's American Milestones series, is a
history lesson but is also vital, engaging music.

<HEADLINE> 'Scary Movie' Brings Wayans Back  </HEADLINE>
By NEKESA MUMBI MOODY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It took failure to make funny man Keenen Ivory
Wayans realize what fans wanted most from him -- laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Wayans, best known as the creator and star of the old Fox sketch
comedy show ''In Living Color,'' wrote and starred in the 1997
action flick ''Most Wanted.'' While the film proved that Wayans,
also the movie's executive producer, could do more than make people
laugh, it also proved to be something else -- a commercial and
critical flop.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will stay focused in comedy,'' says Wayans. ''As a director,
I have more leeway ... but anytime I'm in front of the camera --
that's a comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayans has returned to comedy with his latest project as
director of ''Scary Movie,'' a parody of such teen-horror flicks as
''Scream'' and ''I Know What You Did Last Summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he appears only briefly in a spoof-within-a-spoof
scene, the film has all the salacious satire that audiences have
come to expect from a Wayans project.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the opening of the movie, you see all the cliches -- the
dumb teen-age girl who is doing everything you're not supposed to
do when the killer's after you -- like TALKING TO HIM!'' Wayans
says, laughing. ''Why are you having a conversation with the man?
You're supposed to be on the phone with the police. They stay on
the phone talking to the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the film came from two of Wayans' younger brothers,
Shawn and Marlon, stars of the defunct WB show ''The Wayans
Bros.,'' who are among the five comedic Wayans siblings who include
Damon and sister Kim. (The five other Wayans siblings have
''regular jobs,'' as Keenen puts it.)
</P>
<P>
   Shawn and Marlon also star in ''Scary Movie,'' which features
Cheri Oteri from ''Saturday Night Live'' and Shannon Elizabeth of
''American Pie'' fame.
</P>
<P>
   ''Marlon and Shawn, all they do is sit around and come up with
ideas. Literally. They stay in the house at days at a time and call
me up, at least three times a day going, 'You think this is
funny?''' he says. ''And when they called me up about that, I said
'Yes, that's the one to write.'''
</P>
<P>
   Keenen then helped them hone the script -- over and over and over
-- until it was ready for the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ''They hated me for that -- but I kept making them rewrite it,
rewrite it, giving them notes, and then it was finally ready. Then
they took it to Miramax, and we went from there.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first time the brothers have worked together on a
spoof -- Wayans produced his younger brothers in the 1995 gansta
parody ''Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your
Juice in the Hood.'' And Wayans also parodied blaxploitation with
the hilarious and critically acclaimed 1988 movie ''I'm Gonna Git
You Sucka.''
</P>
<P>
   When it came time to pick a director for ''Scary Movie,'' there
wasn't any question about who it would be.
</P>
<P>
   ''We never thought about going anywhere else. We always try and
go family first, and this is right up Keenen's alley,'' says Marlon
Wayans.
</P>
<P>
   When Shawn and Marlon talk about their older brother, you sense
a genuine feeling of admiration and respect.
</P>
<P>
   Their charismatic brother -- who stands at about 6 feet 3 inches
-- was the first member of the Wayans clan to head for Hollywood
almost two decades ago, gaining bit parts on ''CHiPs'' and
''Benson'' before making a splash as co-writer and co-star of
Robert Townsend's ''Hollywood Shuffle.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I was Daniel Boone; I was the family pioneer,'' recalls
Wayans, 42. ''The funny thing was that I was in L.A., and I was
struggling. But they thought I was rich, because if I had a little
background part on a TV show, then I was on TV. It didn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Once his siblings joined him in Los Angeles, they stuck close
and worked together often, most notably with their biting urban
humor on ''In Living Color.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the show went off the air in 1994, they went their separate
ways to pursue individual projects.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had successes and failures, but even in the successes, they
weren't as much fun,'' Wayans says. ''So we have more fun working
with each other and being a part of each other's different
projects. There's strength in numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Since ''In Living Color'' ended, Wayans has mainly concentrated
on film projects like the comedy ''A Low Down Dirty Shame,'' and
the Steven Seagal thriller ''The Glimmer Man.''
</P>
<P>
   But he returned to television in 1997 as host and executive
producer of ''The Keenen Ivory Wayans Show,'' a late-night talk
show he hoped would fill the void among minority audiences when
''The Arsenio Hall Show'' was canceled in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Wayans' return to TV turned out to be brief. About the same
time, ''Vibe'' and ''The Magic Hour,'' with basketball great Magic
Johnson as host, aimed to capture the same late-night market. All
of them were canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that the timing of it was so right that everybody got
the same idea at the same time, and instead of it being a hole to
fill, it became a hole too small to fit all the shows that were
trying to get in, and I think that everyone just cannibalized each
other,'' Wayans says.
</P>
<P>
   Wayans was supposed to make another return to television last
year, to produce a sitcom for NBC. But his commitment to ''Scary
Movie'' prevented him from delivering it, so the deal fell through.
</P>
<P>
   He'd like to see more minority-themed shows on network
television, and is troubled by the all-white makeup of most hit
shows' casts.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sad thing is that Hollywood is a place where you can
pretend anything. And so what it says is that they don't even want
to pretend that we get along or that we interact or that we live
together or share the same tastes, or anything,'' he says.
''They've created a fantasy of total exclusion. And it's just
sad.''

<HEADLINE> San Francisco Opera Leader Recalls  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE SILVERMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Lotfi Mansouri is fond of saying that he
saved countless lives over the years by making opera his
profession.
</P>
<P>
   ''My father wanted me to become a doctor,'' he recalls.
''Unfortunately, I had no interest in medicine, and would not have
been a very good one.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, sadly, the world of opera is about to lose what the world
of medicine was spared. At age 71, Mansouri is just one year away
from retiring as general director of the San Francisco Opera.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in his modest fourth-floor office backstage at
the War Memorial Opera House, Mansouri reflected recently on a
career that traces back to his first appearance as an extra in
Verdi's ''Otello'' half a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, that ''Otello'' was a production by the San Francisco
Opera, which in 1951 was visiting Los Angeles, where the
Iranian-born Mansouri was studying at the University of California
at Los Angeles. He took singing lessons (he's a tenor), but soon
gravitated toward the production end of the business, becoming a
stage designer and eventually an administrator -- in Zurich and
Geneva, Switzerland,Toronto, and, since 1988, in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   For a time in the 1970s he was cultural adviser to the shah, who
built Iran's first opera house as part of the celebrations marking
the 2,500th anniversary of the Peacock Throne. Mansouri staged
several productions there and was reconciled with his father, who
finally forgave him for abandoning medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ''But, of course, it all came crashing down with the
revolution,'' says Mansouri, who has not been back to Iran since
and doesn't expect ever to be able to return.
</P>
<P>
   And so, in permanent exile, he presides over an organization
whose annual budget of more than $50 million makes it the
second-largest opera company in North America after New York City's
Metropolitan Opera. Its season runs from September into January,
then, unlike most opera companies in the United States, it picks up
again with a full schedule for June.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've proved that we can draw a subscription audience to fill
our 3,000 seats even in June,'' Mansouri says. ''The Bay Area has
grown so much that we now have 6 million potential customers -- very
affluent customers, too.''
</P>
<P>
   This June saw good, if not always sold-out, houses for three
operas, one from each of the last three centuries: Mozart's ''Don
Giovanni,'' directed by Mansouri himself along with
soprano-turned-director Graziella Sciutti; Wagner's ''Parsifal'' in
a striking, space-age setting by Nikolaus Lehnhoff; and
Stravinsky's ''The Rake's Progress,'' produced by John Cox with
sets by painter David Hockney.
</P>
<P>
   The company has always played in the major leagues when it comes
to competing for top singers. The Stravinsky, for example, starred
Welsh baritone Bryn Terfel as Nick Shadow, the devil who leads poor
Tom Rakewell to disaster. The title role of ''Don Giovanni'' was
sung by Russian baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky, and the crucial part
of Gurnemanz, elder knight of the Holy Grail in ''Parsifal,'' was
taken by the great German bass Kurt Moll, who first sang the role
here in 1974 and sounded amazingly sonorous despite the passage of
time.
</P>
<P>
   Artistically, the results were uneven. ''Parsifal'' was a
complete triumph, the ''Rake's Progress'' dryly amusing, the ''Don
Giovanni'' listless and, in some key roles, weakly sung.
</P>
<P>
   Mansouri seems to take the critical brickbats, as well as the
laurels, in stride. ''One thing about a general director: Everybody
knows how to do my job better,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly Mansouri's greatest challenge during his tenure was
leading the company through the renovations required by damage from
the 1989 earthquake. The repairs provided an opportunity to improve
a house that hadn't been modernized since it opened in 1932 -- but
it meant the auditorium would be unavailable for 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course, some of my more conservative board members wanted
to close us down (as was done at London's Covent Garden during
renovations),'' Mansouri says. ''They think you save money doing
that.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I was prepared for them,'' he says with an impish smile.
''I had a study done that proved it would cost us $15 million just
to do nothing. And that didn't even include the cost of losing our
audience, some of whom would never come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Mansouri used the opportunity to break down what he
calls opera's ''elitist image'' by taking it to the community. He
staged productions in two different settings -- the mammoth Bill
Graham Civic Auditorium for amplified spectacles like Borodin's
''Prince Igor,'' and the smallish Orpheum Theater, where he put on
Puccini's ''La Boheme'' in an eight-performances-a-week format with
a top price of $70, compared to the usual $120 for orchestra seats.
</P>
<P>
   Critical response to the 1996-97 season was mixed, but Mansouri
considers it a huge success.
</P>
<P>
   ''We met our main goal, which was to attract the first-time
operagoer,'' he says. For performances of ''La Boheme,'' the
average age of the audience was 31, compared to an average age in
the opera house of 54.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, some of the newcomers weren't exactly musical
sophisticates, but they were just the type of patron Mansouri was
hoping to attract.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd stand in the lobby during the 'Boheme' intermissions and
people would come up to me and ask, 'Is this the original Broadway
cast?''' he recalls.
</P>
<P>
   A lifelong advocate of the premise that ''opera is for
everyone,'' Mansouri helped popularize the art form while in
Toronto by introducing supertitles, the running English
translations that appear above the proscenium. Initially assailed
by purists as a distraction, these titles have become ubiquitous.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now, Wagner doesn't seem so long,'' Mansouri says. ''My God,
people even laugh at the jokes in the 'Ring' cycle!''
</P>
<P>
   Mansouri thinks the next revolution in opera will be the visual
magic offered by computer-generated graphics, used by the company
in a 1998 production of Berg's ''Lulu.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Look what it's already doing for the movies. Can you imagine
the possibilities!'' he asks excitedly. ''George Lucas doing the
'Ring'? Or Pixar doing 'The Magic Flute'?''
</P>
<P>
   Mansouri has worked hard to continue the company's proud history
of presenting soon-to-be-famous artists before they appear
elsewhere in this country. Over the decades, such legendary
sopranos as Leontyne Price, Birgit Nilsson and Renata Tebaldi all
made their U.S. operatic debuts here.
</P>
<P>
   This past June included two promising U.S. debuts -- English
tenor Christopher Ventris, who made a convincingly youthful and
brightly sung Parsifal, and Monica Colonna, an Italian soprano who
had the power and technique, if not yet the confidence, for the
role of Donna Anna in ''Don Giovanni.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Mansouri's proudest coups was engaging conductor Valery
Gergiev of the Kirov Opera in 1991, before he was widely little
known in the West. Gergiev has since become an international
celebrity, and the Met recently named him its principal guest
conductor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Joe Volpe (Met general manager) thinks he just discovered
Valery Gergiev,'' Mansouri says with a laugh. ''I said, 'Excuse me,
Joe, he's been here for eight years. You really need to come see
what we can do in the provinces.'''
</P>
<P>
   One star he failed to entice was Italian mezzo Cecilia Bartoli.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was close,'' he sighs. ''I wanted her to do Offenbach's 'La
Perichole.' She came out here to look at the house, but then she
decided no. I wish she had trusted me.''
</P>
<P>
   Future casting decisions will be up to Mansouri's successor,
Pamela Rosenberg, a California native who now runs the Stuttgart
Opera. She'll arrive at the end of the year and work together with
Mansouri for six months before taking over for the 2001-02 season.
</P>
<P>
   But given the need to book artists years in advance, all the
planning for the 2001-02 was already done before Rosenberg's
appointment. She was able to have some input into 2002-03.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told her I'll take all the blame for that season, too,''
Mansouri says. ''After that, she's on her own.''
</P>
<P>
   Mansouri, meanwhile, plans keep his hand in directing, in San
Francisco or elsewhere, ''if it's a really lovely project.''
</P>
<P>
   Given his evident vigor and enthusiasm, one is tempted to ask
why he is retiring at all.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a cliche, but in this business especially, you have to
know how to make an exit,'' he says. ''Better to go when I still
enjoy coming to work every day, before people start saying, 'Oh, is
he still around?'''

<HEADLINE> Taos Artist Show Tells Tale of Art  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD BENKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAOS, N.M. (AP) -- Indians settled in the lap of their
13,000-foot mountain 1,000 years ago. Spaniards brought trade and
religion 600 years later. Mountain men sought bear, beaver,
buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a century of artists, hunting images and leaving a
historical record of once-wild Taos as a cultural phenomenon. The
documentary evidence is all wrapped up in a neat package at the
Albuquerque Museum, where an exhibition, ''Taos Artists and Their
Patrons,'' runs through Aug. 6, then opens in San Antonio, Texas,
Sept. 12.
</P>
<P>
   The real thing is still here, too, along these old, narrow,
adobe-lined streets 150 miles north of the museum. The plaza
emporium depicted by J. Ward Lockwood's 1931 painting is still open
for business, selling T-shirts, Indian-type drums and other
souvenirs. The old cemetery painted by Barbara Latham in 1944 is
still adorned with flowers and mementoes. And the elegant adobe
structures of Taos Pueblo painted by Walter Ufer in 1917 still draw
thousands of tourists annually.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the Taos Artists, Ernest Blumenschein and Bert G.
Phillips, arrived in 1898. One of their wagon wheels broke 20 miles
from town. Blumenschein carried the wheel, on horseback, into Taos
for repairs.
</P>
<P>
   The two Eastern artists, enthralled, painted many canvases here
in the ensuing 30 years. Blumenschein came and went. Phillips never
left.
</P>
<P>
   ''That started off the whole art colony,'' Taos Mayor Fred
Peralta says. ''It's a time that kind of put Taos on the map, in
the sense of the outside world learning about this community.''
</P>
<P>
   The artists brought their friends and their friends' friends to
Taos.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they were kind of captivated by the landscapes that
were painted by the artists here,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But art was already here when Bert and Blumy arrived -- the
valley has been continuously inhabited for about 1,000 years. It
flourished long before the Spaniards came in 1600, before the
trappers arrived in the 1830s, before New Mexico was purchased by
the United States in 1848.
</P>
<P>
   Today, art to Taos is more than just a pretty picture -- it's
bread and butter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would have to say it is a really major influence. It could
be as much as 25 percent of our economy,'' Peralta says.
</P>
<P>
   The Taos phenomenon didn't just happen by itself. There was no
art market here in 1898. The Taos Society of Artists had to create
a market, and did. The group had patrons like John D. Rockefeller
Jr., Phoebe Apperson Hearst, Mabel Dodge Luhan and the Santa Fe
Railway, among many.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Fe Railway marketing agent William Haskell Simpson used
the paintings in a promotional campaign that glamorized the
Southwest as a desirable destination. So the railroad subsidized
the art colony and created a tourist influx that helped grow the
town.
</P>
<P>
   From 1916 to 1926, too, the artists organized traveling
exhibitions that usually opened in New York City and worked their
way West, closing at the Fine Arts Museum in Santa Fe.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the museum show's featured artists who followed Phillips
and Blumenschein include Oscar Berninghaus, John Marin, Victor
Higgins, Robert Henri, Howard Cook and Eanger Irving Couse. Their
paintings, on loan for the show from museums around the country,
captured Indian and Hispanic traditions in detail.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips' ''Penitente Burial Procession'' shows the sweep of
Taos Valley as a line of mourners stretches for a mile along a
curving path, on foot, led by three crosses and the casket borne on
four men's shoulders. Couse's ''Wal-si-el'' depicts an Indian
kneeling before a hot ''kiva'' hearth beside a classically painted
pueblo pot. Berninghaus' ''Peace and Plenty'' shows two Indians and
their harvest bounty.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 paintings are in the show, spanning 1898 to 1950,
said Ellen Landis, curator of art at the Albuquerque Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The artists, she said, were in a unique position to see the real
Taos.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because they lived there, because they were friends of so many
people, they were offered the opportunity to see things --
traditions, cultural and ethnic, that a stranger wouldn't have the
opportunity to see,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many other artists who worked here after the Taos Society
disbanded in 1927, such as Georgia O'Keeffe, contributed to the
record of Taos, even if not to the show. O'Keeffe, who stayed with
Mabel Dodge Luhan, painted the back of the San Francisco de Asis
Church near Taos, and it remains an art and tourism icon. She
painted the Lawrence Tree, a large ponderosa pine outside D.H.
Lawrence's cabin north of town, and it became a familiar image and
tourist draw, as well.
</P>
<P>
   There are nearly 100 art galleries and 1,000 artists in this
small northern New Mexico town of 6,000 people, which is a ski
resort in the winter and a hiking-fishing-sightseeing resort in
summers.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's interesting about Taos, too, is that it's often seen as
a center of revolt against intruders, a bit more radical than the
other pueblos,'' says Paul Andrew Hutton, a historian at the
University of New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   There had been pueblo uprisings in 1680 and again in 1847.
</P>
<P>
   These new artistic intruders, though, got along fine with the
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe that's because they weren't always trying to impose
their will,'' Hutton says, adding the edginess of the pueblo seemed
to appeal to the freethinking artists.
</P>
<P>
   Territorial Gov. Charles Bent and 20 others were killed in the
pueblo revolt of 1847. Bent died in his house, which is now an art
gallery.
</P>
<P>
   If there was any single thing that transformed Taos from
isolated aerie to tourist Mecca, Hutton says, ''it's art.''
</P>
<P>
   That and the automobile, adds Mayor Peralta.

<HEADLINE> A Century of Jorge Luis Borges  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL MELIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Barely into his afterlife,
Argentina's foremost writer is striding toward immortality.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 50 years until his death in 1986, Jorge Luis
Borges produced short stories, poems and essays in a precise,
almost mathematical style that set the standard for a generation of
Spanish-language writers.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is the subject of a new documentary, his writings are
praised as far away as New York, Tokyo and London and, last year, a
posthumous collection of his essays won a National Book Critics
Circle Award.
</P>
<P>
   A century after his birth, Borges is back -- his works now
ushering in generations of new readers to the surreal labyrinths of
his mind.
</P>
<P>
   His writings still beckon with the allure of magical worlds, of
intertwining realities as much the enigmatic creations of his
imagination as his own interpretation of a Buenos Aires of long
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Borges is great. ... He's one of the greatest of the 20th
century,'' says Roberto Gonzalez Echevarria, a literature professor
at Yale University who ranks the writer among T.S. Eliot and Ezra
Pound.
</P>
<P>
   He credits Borges with creating his own genre through meticulous
attention to language, and with uniquely enveloping his musings
inside detective stories, essays and adventure tales.
</P>
<P>
   ''The short story that is an essay and the essay that is a short
story, and also a brain teaser -- that brought to light one of the
dilemmas of the 20th century: The more we understand about
language, the less we know about language itself,'' Echevarria
says.
</P>
<P>
   Works such as ''El Aleph'' and ''Fictions'' blended fact and
fiction in masterful, dreamlike atmospheres. Several Latin American
''magical realists'' later praised Borges for pioneering that
style. As a contributor to the modernist dialogue, he also made his
presence known in other areas, from translation to political
satire.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Borges produced more than 35 volumes of writings and his
works were translated into dozens of languages, winning him many
major literary awards. Only the Nobel Prize proved elusive.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1999, centennial celebrations of the writer's birth
cast new attention on his works. Fans toasted the 100th anniversary
with art exhibits, poetry readings and essay prizes. Officials
unveiled a coin emblazoned with the portrait of the famously gaunt
writer and officials dedicated a new museum containing his
manuscripts. Trend-conscious readers even snapped up new editions
of his works.
</P>
<P>
   Borgesmania also reached the United States, where ''Selected
Non-Fictions'' won a National Book Critics Circle Award -- honored
for the collection of essays, lectures and film reviews in
recognition of a broad vision so amply praised in his fiction.
</P>
<P>
   While Borges has made high school readings lists here, he is not
an easy read for everyone, his works difficult to many.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he is read.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if they understand his books, but they read
them,'' says Juan Jose Sulich, a clerk at a Buenos Aires bookstore
where Borges used to give readings in later life, albeit blind and
bent over his trademark engraved cane.
</P>
<P>
   Tristan Bauer, who made the documentary ''The Books and the
Night,'' sought to explain in the film many of the literary
labyrinths. Bauer is concerned about those who would give up too
easily on Borges.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that's a very grave problem in our society,'' Bauer
says. ''If Argentina produced a writer, a thinker of this
magnitude, I think the people in charge of the culture politically
need to make an effort to promote these figures.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, Borges' reality-transforming works have challenged
readers for generations. His works became popular internationally
after he was ''discovered'' by French intellectuals in the 1950s,
only to be criticized for a time afterward as ''incomprehensible.''
</P>
<P>
   He wrote with scrupulous economy, producing famously concise
stories. His most well-known short story, ''The Aleph,'' brimmed
with insights of his own particular view of the universe in just a
few dozen pages.
</P>
<P>
   Borges carved an erudite path from the age of 6, when he began
devouring the works of Mark Twain, H. G. Wells and Edgar Allan Poe.
From those years in his father's library until his final decades,
when cataracts forced him to rely upon others to read to him, his
world was one of books.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even the most essential experiences of his life -- love,
friendship -- everything was tinged by literature,'' recalls Roberto
Alifano, Borges' former secretary and current editor of the
literary magazine ''Prow,'' which Borges founded in 1922.
</P>
<P>
   After spending his teen-age years in Europe, Borges returned to
Buenos Aires between the two world wars and helped establish a
cultural scene that won favorable comparisons to Paris. His own
literary approach swung from a nationalistic style to a universal
style of his own invention.
</P>
<P>
   Because he chose not to extol the rolling pampas or the gaucho,
or the lifestyle of those Argentine cowboys, many Argentines long
dismissed Borges for the same reason that he shunned tango dancing
and other Argentine cliches: They considered his works a tourist
export.
</P>
<P>
   Borges did look to Europe for his greatest inspiration, but so
did Buenos Aires. While Borges filled his head with the ideas of
Arthur Schopenhauer and Lord Byron, his city looked to Madrid's
Gran Via and Paris' Right Bank. Like his home city, he wasn't
wholly Latin American or European, but uniquely Argentine.
</P>
<P>
   ''One fraction of the population loves him, one fraction hates
him, and the majority in the middle have their doubts,'' says
Flavio Sorbellini, 31, manager of another bookshop.
</P>
<P>
   The political and personal controversies surrounding Borges'
public profile, however, have overshadowed his literary legacy for
many in this capital.
</P>
<P>
   ''Borges was always a very controversial figure in Argentina,''
says Maria Kodama, the author's former student and secretary, whom
he married three weeks before his death. ''I think people are more
interested abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   Though blind from his mid 50s, he continued to stroll the
sidewalks of Buenos Aires, cane in hand and suit jacket buttoned,
well into his 80s. Dozens of books filled with interviews, memoirs
and testimonials produced by still-living friends and former
students have kept his memory fresh.
</P>
<P>
   The memories include controversy, like the award Borges accepted
from Chile's military regime of the 1970s. Scholars have suggested
his reluctance to condemn authoritarian rule may have kept the
Nobel Prize at arm's length.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a small circle of passionate Borges readers is waging
a campaign to draw more attention to his work. But Argentina has
little money available for cultural projects. And promoting a
writer as enigmatic as Borges is not easy.
</P>
<P>
   Nicolas Helft, a 41-year-old computer scientist and Borges fan,
oversees the largest collection of Borges documents in a spare
bedroom of his home. Besides tending thousands of texts,
manuscripts and newspaper clippings, Helft also is co-writing his
fourth book about Borges.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are trying to uncover the links between biography and the
work to help people understand a few fundamental ideas,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Borges' biographer and former friend Maria Esther Vazquez spent
last year traveling through the Argentine interior lecturing on the
author, convinced that an interest in him can be taught.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you explain Borges to them, people get interested,'' says
Vazquez, whose apartment features rare photos of the author
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Borges' current pop-icon celebrity, Vazquez believes
that people will enjoy his work for ''as long as humanity walks the
Earth.'' How many Argentines will appreciate their advanced but
misunderstood patriarch, though, is a question she doesn't want to
answer.
</P>
<P>
   ''What country truly knows its great writers?'' she asks.

   WASHINGTON (AP)-- President Clinton said Wednesday Mexican
President-elect Vicente Fox is welcome to visit Washington at any

   Clinton spoke a day after Fox said he intends to make a U.S.
visit soon to pursue his goal of having the two countries become
''true partners, true neighbors, and true friends.''

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Falls 78; Dow Gains 8  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks were mostly lower Wednesday
after Computer Associates became the latest company to warn that
profits won't meet expectations. But strength in financial stocks
pulled the Dow Jones industrial average up from earlier lows.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the blue-chip Dow average was
up 7.78 at 10,568.45.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 12.22 at 1,457.10, and the Nasdaq composite index
was down 77.80 at 3,914.13.
</P>
<P>
   Computer Associates plummeted $21.375 to $29.75, a 42 percent
drop. Shortly after midnight Tuesday, the company surprised Wall
Street analysts by warning that its fiscal first-quarter results
would badly miss expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The warning raised fears that other technology companies will
also issue disappointing results when the earnings reporting season
goes into full gear later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, BMC Software said Wednesday morning that fiscal
first-quarter earnings will be 18 to 21 cents a share, compared
with analysts' consensus of 46 cents. Its shares fell $12.438 to
$22.063 on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   ''The damage is fairly well concentrated in the technology
stocks,'' said William Meehan, chief market analyst for Cantor
Fitzgerald. ''It's feeding on itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the largest technology companies fell prey to investors'
worries about earnings. IBM fell $6.313 to $103.563 and Intel fell
$3.688 to $133.188.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Oracle fell $6.75 to $73.438 after J.P. Morgan analyst
William Epifanio downgraded the stock to ''market performer'' from
''buy.'' Epifanio cited concerns over Oracle's plan for management
succession after president and chief operating officer Ray Lane
stepped down last week.
</P>
<P>
   Oil stocks were also lower in the first trading session since
Saudi Arabia signaled it may soon begin producing an additional
half-million barrels a day. The Saudis said in a statement Monday
they will provide higher production within a few days if crude
prices don't quickly head lower toward their preferred price of
about $25 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon Mobil fell $1.984 to $77.563.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks improved on the news that a key gauge of future
economic activity fell in May, suggesting that the Federal
Reserve's efforts to put the brakes on economic expansion are
working.
</P>
<P>
   The Index of Leading Economic Indicators declined by 0.1
percent, primarily because of a pullback in manufacturing and a
decline in stock prices. The report raised some hopes that the Fed
will leave rates unchanged at its next meeting on Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan rose $2.563 to $118.313.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-6 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 436.71 million
shares, compared with 303.77 million shares at the same time
Monday. The stock market was closed on Tuesday for the Independence
Day holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 4.94 to 519.10.

<HEADLINE> Donors To Rebuild Chernobyl Casing  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL GEITNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Work to replace the leaky cement shell covering
the ruined nuclear reactor at Chernobyl can begin now that Western
nations have pledged to pay almost the entire estimated cost of
$768 million, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can get started quite soon and we can put all our efforts
into it,'' German Environment Minister Juergen Trittin said at the
end of a conference of more than 40 donor nations in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Chernobyl, a Soviet-built nuclear power plant in Ukraine, was
the site of the world's worst nuclear accident when an explosion
and fire at one of its reactors in April 1986 spewed radiation over
much of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the new cover -- which will replace one the Soviets
hastily constructed over the ruined reactor -- is needed to prevent
new releases of radiation. But Ukraine, still struggling to rebuild
its economy after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, has
pushed for outside help to pay for the work.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's donor conference, following one in New York in 1997,
raised additional pledges of $319 million from major industrial
nations including the United States, bringing the total funding
promised to $715 million of the $768 million needed.
</P>
<P>
   German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said he expected the
''relatively low'' amount remaining -- about $53 million -- could be
raised at a third donor conference in the future.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference with his German hosts, Ukrainian Prime
Minister Viktor Yushchenko said he was satisfied with the pledges.
''There were expectations and the expectations have been
surpassed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ukraine was less receptive to German efforts to persuade it to
give up plans to replace the energy lost from shutting Chernobyl by
building two new Russian-type reactors.
</P>
<P>
   Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma promised in early June to shut
down Chernobyl's last working reactor on Dec. 15, and wants
additional international aid to help build the replacement plants.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Yushchenko said only that his country
would continue with efforts to ''improve safety in using nuclear
facilities.''

<HEADLINE> Celebrity Spotlight &AMP; Birthdays  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the birthday spotlight:
</P>
<P>
   Courtney Love is condemning music piracy, but she isn't
referring to music freely distributed over the Internet. ''It's not
piracy when kids swap music on the Internet,'' she says. The
outspoken singer-actress says record companies are the real pirates
because they pay artists so little for their work. Her stance
contrasts with that of other leading artists, who consider Napster
and other Internet music services a threat to royalty payments.
Love, a principal member of the band Hole, was born on July 9,
1964. Her film roles include ''Man on the Moon'' with Jim Carrey.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hanks dropped 60 pounds for his role in the upcoming film
''Cast Away.'' Hanks, who was born on July 9, 1956, plays a Federal
Express executive who is stranded on a desert island for four
years. ''It's almost like making a silent movie,'' said Hanks,
whose previous films include ''Saving Private Ryan.'' ''You have to
tell every aspect of the story physically, being totally alone.''
The film is set for a Christmas release.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Jenna Elfman  </HEADLINE>
By LISI de BOURBON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Like any smart investor, Jenna Elfman is
diversifying her portfolio -- her portfolio of characters, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Since she started playing the flighty but lovable Dharma
Finkelstein on the hit ABC sitcom ''Dharma &AMP; Greg,'' the
28-year-old actress has taken on roles that range from a corporate
conquistadora to a model involved in a stormy romance with a
writer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now people are a little more aware that 'yes, she's an
actress, she's not just one character and she actually can do other
characters,''' Elfman said during a telephone interview. ''I just
feel like I've been introduced, and now I'm rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   She credits ''Keeping the Faith,'' her most recent film, with
lifting her to the next level. She plays Anna Reilly, a successful
businesswoman whose two best friends, a rabbi (Ben Stiller) and a
priest (Edward Norton), fall in love with her.
</P>
<P>
   To play Anna, Elfman had to lower her voice and tone herself
down, no small task for the naturally effervescent and energetic
actress.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did like 13 or 20 takes on one scene because I could not
slow it down enough,'' she said, ''because I thought I was going to
explode if I slowed down that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Elfman, a native of Los Angeles, says she was a talkative
youngster whose mouth was taped shut by one of her teachers to stop
her from speaking during class.
</P>
<P>
   She began studying ballet when she was 5. An injury prevented
her from accepting a spot at a prestigious ballet school. Being
part of a Debbie Allen dance production for the 1991 Academy Awards
was less rewarding than Elfman anticipated, so she turned her
attention to acting. She landed several small TV roles, working as
a backup dancer on ZZ Top's 1994 tour to help pay the bills. Two
years later, she won a role on the short-lived series ''Townies''
with Molly Ringwald.
</P>
<P>
   Elfman starred with Matthew McConaughey, Woody Harrelson, Ellen
DeGeneres and Elizabeth Hurley in ''EDtv.'' ''Town &AMP; Country,'' her
next movie, is scheduled for release in August. It stars Warren
Beatty, Diane Keaton and Goldie Hawn.
</P>
<P>
   1. What was it like to work on ''Town &AMP; Country'' with such
established Hollywood stars?
</P>
<P>
   Elfman: Well, Goldie Hawn for years has been my hero. ... And so
now I'm acting with her after forever going, 'I wish I could be
her, I wish I could be her.' So it was very exciting.
</P>
<P>
   2. What makes ''Dharma &AMP; Greg'' so popular?
</P>
<P>
   Elfman: I think there hasn't been a free-spirited girl who's
purely joyful, purely cares about others, and who's purely sane and
happy on television in a long time.
</P>
<P>
   2&AMP;frac12;. What was the last show that featured one?
</P>
<P>
   Elfman: Per my reality, I'd say 'The Carol Burnett Show.' But
that was variety and they were doing characters. But she was having
fun. She was a good girl, you know. She wasn't neurotic, she wasn't
psychotic, she wasn't insecure, she was just present, and I think
that's refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   3. Why are viewers so drawn to Dharma?
</P>
<P>
   Elfman: Women relate to her because she's probably in their
soul, their inner voice because I think everybody truly is free,
and men dig her because she's cute and has a good sense of humor
and she's not intimidating to women, and also has a good working
marriage that is sexually active. They solve their problems by way
of communication. They honor each other, they admire each other,
and I think people find the hope that they can find that for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   4. What would you like to do in the future?
</P>
<P>
   Elfman: A good variety of roles is probably the ideal because
that's what I love to do. Of course, when you're doing comedy,
comedy, comedy, you want to do drama. When you're doing drama,
drama, drama, you want to do a comedy. I think I've watched other
actresses do this because you sort of want to be taken seriously
and be a 'dramatic actress,' and then the movies never do well and
whatever. So I had a glimpse of wanting to do more drama, of which
I do want to do, but I'm not in a big rush right now. I want to
just keep doing interesting characters; girls that have something
different about them.
</P>
<P>
   5. Where did you get that terrific tan for ''Keeping the
Faith''?
</P>
<P>
   Elfman: Normally, I'm just pale all the time and I don't care,
but I had to go to a tanning bed in SoHo, and oh, I was just laying
there, hearing my skin sizzle, going, 'Why did I ever do this?' And
if I ever had a couple of days, I'd go down to the beach and fry my
skin some more. Yeah, it was a little fake bake.

<HEADLINE> Nashville Sound: Vince Gill  </HEADLINE>
By JIM PATTERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Vince Gill quotes a review of his latest
album: ''He's in love. We're not.'' He laughs, then quotes another:
''He was a much better artist when he was miserable.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm happy, and I'm going to get crucified for it,'' he said
with a shrug. ''I'm just getting ripped. Because it's sappy and
it's lovey-dovey and all those kinds of things.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is ''Let's Make Sure We Kiss Goodbye,'' an album of
buoyant love songs Gill released in April (MCA).
</P>
<P>
   ''Sure, it sounds like a Hallmark greeting card sometimes,'' he
said. ''But that's how I feel. Life is really sweet. It's really
gentle. Call it corny, call it schmaltzy, call it sappy, call it
all those words, anything you want. It is that, but it feels great.
I like it.''
</P>
<P>
   The album follows Gill's marriage in March to Christian-pop
singer Amy Grant, which came after months of tabloid speculation
and rumors. Grant divorced former TV host Gary Chapman last June,
two years after Gill divorced singer Janis Gill. The events plunged
a guy generally considered a musician's musician and an uncommonly
unaffected country star into tabloid hell.
</P>
<P>
   He declines to give details of the courtship.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think, all in all, I can be proud of how I've handled it,''
Gill said. ''My personal life, I've tried to keep personal and stay
respectful and kind.
</P>
<P>
   ''You won't find me bad-mouthing anybody throughout any of this.
No, it's not always fun. Sometimes you get your belly full of
everybody trying to tell you what you're thinking, what you mean,
and they really don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   It is tough, though, to resist interpreting some of the songs as
hinting at what's going on in Gill's head.
</P>
<P>
   From ''The Luckiest Guy in the World'': ''We watch old movies
and cry at the endings/And get lost in each other's eyes/We hold
hands when we're walking and/Spend all night talking and make love
as the sun starts to rise.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of 12 songs on the CD have similar themes. Grant co-wrote
two of the songs. She sings a duet with Gill and appears on the CD
cover kissing him.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gill said it would be wrong to take the album as
literally about his life.
</P>
<P>
   ''It may look personal because of how you perceive my life to
be,'' he said. ''Was a record I made in 1991 as personal just
because you didn't know the current state of my affairs?''
</P>
<P>
   Music critics have compared the album unfavorably with 1998's
''The Key,'' one of the best albums in country music history. While
the new album doesn't measure up, comparing the two isn't fair.
''The Key'' reflects the old standard of soulful, melancholy
country. ''Let's Make Sure We Kiss Goodbye'' is optimistic and
decidedly pop-leaning, and is Gill's first album without the sounds
of steel guitar. It should also be noted that despite its critical
acclaim, singles from ''The Key'' didn't garner much radio airplay,
and sales suffered.
</P>
<P>
   ''(Radio programmers) told me point-blank they didn't want to
play me singing traditional country music,'' Gill said. ''I have an
allegiance with a record company. I have an allegiance to try to
continue to be current, to have hit records. So we made a
contemporary record, in line with what we thought would be
accessible, and having hit records.''
</P>
<P>
   Gill, who isn't touring this year, mixed with fans at the
International Country Music Fan Fair here last month and was
pleased that they were supportive of his music and his personal
life.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that they're thrilled that I'm happy,'' he said. ''I
think they could sense that there was not a real joy going on in me
before.''
</P>
<P>
   After 25 years of riding buses and putting most of his focus on
his career, Gill, 43, said his new marriage has helped him shift
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''I coached one of Amy's kid's softball teams this spring,'' he
said. ''I'm doing car pools and school functions, just kind of
staying at home and trying to get a workout schedule going. I'm
seeing what life is like without a shaving kit and a bus waiting.
... It's pretty nice.''

<HEADLINE> Kansas Launches Tour, Releases Album  </HEADLINE>
By TOM GARDNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Kansas violinist Robby Steinhardt juggles a
piece of berry pie and an interview effortlessly. He's had plenty
of experience with both in his 28 years with the band.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas was kicking off its Masterworks Tour 2000 of more than
100 dates, the first 30 with fellow progressive rock pioneers Yes.
The tour coincides with the release of ''Somewhere to Elsewhere''
(Magna Carta), the band's 19th album.
</P>
<P>
   The album is ''supposed to dispel all the rumors,'' Steinhardt
said.
</P>
<P>
   What rumors?
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not dead.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the band members, all hovering on either side of 50,
believe Kansas has been reborn now that Kerry Livgren has returned
after a 17-year absence. He wrote all 10 songs and plays guitar and
keyboard on the new CD. Dave Hope, who also left in 1983, plays
bass on two cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's something we've always wanted to do as far as get the
band back together to record,'' said drummer Phil Ehart. ''But the
material had to be right, so we just waited until the right time
came along. The material was right, and we had the time to do it,
and we did it.
</P>
<P>
   ''People say it sounds like the early days of Kansas, but it
sounds modern, like it had been recorded today, so that's good.
It's kind of what we had hoped to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas arrived in 1972 and produced gold albums with ''Kansas,''
''Song for America'' and ''Masque,'' and the platinum
''Leftoverture.'' Hit singles included ''Dust in the Wind,''
''Carry on My Wayward Son'' and ''Point of Know Return.''
</P>
<P>
   The new CD is the first time in nearly two decades that seven
members have recorded together.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we've all matured enough and had enough sidelines --
things to concentrate on and things to do in our lives -- that we're
now more focused on Kansas than ever,'' Steinhardt said. ''The fact
that Kerry wrote all the music means an awful lot.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's writing like he never even did before in Kansas. He's
writing much more than he used to and things just seem to be
flowing out of him. There's music to be proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   Livgren said he enjoyed both the music and the camaraderie
during recording sessions at his studio in rural Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess we got together to see if we could still do it, and
not only could we still do it, we found that we could do it better
than we ever did.''
</P>
<P>
   They also found 21st-century technology.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was never in the studio for the Kansas album,'' said lead
singer and keyboardist Steve Walsh, who was busy working on a solo
album, touring and spending time with his wife and infant daughter.
He and Livgren swapped CD-ROMs back and forth until they got a
sound they liked. Other members recorded their tracks together and
separately, and all were mixed together.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh hopes to be in the studio for future albums.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I had my druthers, that's the way every album would be
done, because there's something organic that happens,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in band members and audience's tastes left Kansas with a
loyal following, but only occasional success throughout much of the
1980s and '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got on the down side of the curve, I guess,'' said bassist
Billy Greer, who has been with Kansas for more than 16 years. ''But
I've seen some up side. We're just trying to make a career out of
this. We don't know how to do anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for a two-year break from 1983 to 1985, Kansas has been
on the road constantly, doing 100 to 150 concerts a year. Now they
travel by plane, instead of by bus, flying from one show to the
next.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bus days, that was tough,'' Ehart said. ''We were playing
like four and five days a week in sometimes not very good places.
We can be a lot pickier now. So even though there are some bummer
gigs out there, most of them are ones that we kinda hand pick.''
</P>
<P>
   Guitarist Rich Williams said concerts attract a loyal audience.
''This is your record-buying market. It's the people who listen,
who call radios (stations), make requests.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you play at the state fairs, it's just the people who pay
the price of admission to get in, and they happen to be eating a
corn dog and hear the music start and walk by.''
</P>
<P>
   As the band headed toward the stage, Greer said the best part of
the day ''is that one hour, hour and a half, whatever it is, we're
playing. The rest of it is the work part: the travel and the hotel
and being by yourself and away from your family.
</P>
<P>
   ''We get paid to travel. We play for free.''

<HEADLINE> Ribot Finds Energy in Cuban Music  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME HOLGUIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Guitarist Marc Ribot is a musician's musician,
capable of traveling in many directions and unafraid to explore
extremes.
</P>
<P>
   Elvis Costello, Marianne Faithfull and Tom Waits have used his
passionate guitar playing on their albums and tours. His own
projects range from Haitian classical to punk and avant-jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Though disparate, his music is bound, he said, ''by an energy
that I got addicted to when I was very young and heard rock bands
playing in small rooms where everybody's sweating and pushing each
other.
</P>
<P>
   ''That kind of intensity is what I look for.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Ribot found it in Cuban music, particularly the
work of blind bandleader and tres player Arsenio Rodriguez, whose
career spanned several decades beginning in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was the Jimi Hendrix of his time and place, really pushing
the envelope on what it was possible to play, and that interested
me right away,'' said Ribot, 46, who decided to reinterpret some of
the music.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's band generally included backup singers, large
percussion section, full horn section, piano and tres (a small
double-stringed variant of the guitar). Ribot had only a handful of
musicians to work with, so first he learned the songs as guitar
solos.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the other musicians screwed them up,'' he explained, ''I'd
still be playing something. I could keep it going all by myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, he found four equally proficient musicians in
keyboardist Anthony Coleman, bassist Brad Jones, percussionist E.J.
Rodriguez and drummer Robert J. Rodriguez. During a recent
performance at the Knitting Factory, Los Cubanos Postizos played
with the energy of a punk rock band and the soul of an original
Cuban son band.
</P>
<P>
   That spirit is captured on the new album ''MUY DIVERTIDO! (Very
Entertaining!)'' (Atlantic), a mixture of original material and
interpretations of old Cuban songs. Like its predecessor, ''MUY
DIVERTIDO!'' successfully fuses the sound of New York City's
avant-garde scene, of which Ribot is a leading light, with the
austerity of Cuban folk music.
</P>
<P>
   The quirky percussion and muted melodies of ''Obsession'' are
reminiscent of Ribot's earlier work with the enigmatic crooner
Waits, while ''Baile Baile Baile'' draws from his more discordant
inclinations. On ''Dame Un Cachito Pa'Huele,'' the band reinvents
Rodriguez's 1940s hit, doing for the original what Carlos Santana
did for the Tito Puente-penned classic ''Oye Como Va.''
</P>
<P>
   With the recent popularity of all things Latin, it's not
surprising that Los Cubanos Postizos is Ribot's most successful
solo project to date. Although he welcomes the attention, ''it
upsets me that we seem to have wound up being trendy more than it
upsets anyone else. Basically, we did the first record because it
was fun, and we did the second record because it was still fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Though not a household name, Ribot does carry clout in the music
business, especially within New York City's downtown music scene.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever he wants to try out a new project, he books a gig
somewhere and uses one of the city's performance venues as his
rehearsal space. The results vary depending on his collaborator.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's making discordant atonal squawks with noise
adventurer Mike Patton, plucking lush nylon-stringed melodies with
Peruvian-singer Susana Baca, or creating hip-shaking Cuban rhythms
with his band, Ribot consistently leaves his unique mark.
</P>
<P>
   His musical training began at an early age with family friend
Frantz Casseus, the Haitian classical composer and guitarist.
Casseus played often at the Ribot family home in suburban New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've heard him playing since I was 6 years old,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though he formally studied with Casseus for three years, ''It's
not like I was some budding 11-year-old classical guitar
virtuoso,'' Ribot said. ''All I wanted to do was play in a garage
rock band.''

<HEADLINE> Indigo Girls: Substance Before Style  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN ROGERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Mention the Indigo Girls' latest cause --
boycotting South Carolina until it stopped flying the Confederate
flag -- and one is likely to provoke a surprisingly nervous chuckle
from Amy Ray.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know, it just gets old to people, huh?'' Ray laughs after a
moment of equivocating. ''They go, 'There's the Indigo Girls again.
They can't just do the music, can they?'
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like we've got political lesbians stamped on our
foreheads,'' jokes Ray of the duo's commitment to sexual freedom,
civil rights and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   These are not positions, she said, that have endeared them to
the music industry. Ray and musical partner Emily Sailers have been
nominated for a handful of Grammys, but have won just one, best
contemporary folk-music recording, for their 1989 debut album,
''Indigo Girls.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ray said they had the right -- if not an obligation -- to
speak out about the flag controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a Southerner, you know,'' she said in a voice that makes
it clear that she is abundantly proud of it. ''I'm
fourth-generation Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ''And, yeah, all my friends and I sat around and listened to
Lynyrd Skynyrd and drank beer with a rebel T-shirt on. 'Til I was
about 12 anyway. So I understand that sentiment, I really do. But
it's wrong. And you've got to grow up someday.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken, one notes, like a true Indigo Girl, whose music is
filled with sweetness and emotional understanding on the one hand
and a realization that it's a hard world out there and everyone
should try to make it a little better.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Ray is complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a good life, I'd say,'' she said by phone from her
Georgia home. She joked that her house in the woods outside Atlanta
is a place where she hides during those rare periods when she and
Sailers aren't on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ''The music business gets old sometimes, you just get tired of
dealing with the same stuff over and over again throughout the
years, the commercialism, the sexism,'' she said. ''But we've had a
good life.''
</P>
<P>
   When she's not on tour, Ray stays close to home, running Daemon,
her small independent record label. Sailers is more outgoing, she
said, and enjoys entertaining friends at her restaurant in Decatur.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm more of a loner. But if I haven't seen her in about a
week, I'll drop by the restaurant,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   They met in elementary school more than 25 years ago, after
Sailers, a Connecticut native, moved to Georgia with her family.
They grew up solidly middle class.
</P>
<P>
   ''We weren't really friends until we started singing together,''
Ray said. ''She was a year ahead of me, and you know how that goes
in elementary school.''
</P>
<P>
   Those schoolgirl barriers fell and the Indigo Girls were born
when Ray reached 16 and acquired all the respect and stature that
come with a driver's license.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been through all the things you go through as a family:
Death. Marriage. People being born,'' Ray said.
</P>
<P>
   For a dozen years now, they have chronicled much of it on a
series of generally well-received albums on the Epic label, while
building an ever-growing niche of fans with almost nonstop touring.
</P>
<P>
   In songs about everything from junkies, bars and life on the
road to love, religion and politics, their music reflects their
early influences, from Bob Dylan to REM, Woody Guthrie to the
Clash, Appalachian mountain music and Irish ballads to hard rock
and Neil Young.
</P>
<P>
   What sets the two apart from other duos is the sweet, soaring
harmonies they bring to almost all of their songs; a blending of
voices usually found only among sibling performers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Emily's family was real musical,'' Ray said. ''Her dad is this
incredible composer of sacred music and a virtuoso piano player.
She's from this, like, very technically proficient musical family,
and I'm from a family that just loves music.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Sailers picked it up naturally, Ray said she struggled to
learn to play the musical scales. But with help from her older
sisters, she persevered, eventually becoming proficient on piano,
guitar and other stringed instruments.
</P>
<P>
   When they started out, they were too loud for coffeehouses and
too folk-sounding for punk bars. So they found a musical home on
the ''fern bar'' circuit.
</P>
<P>
   The ''fern bar'' circuit?
</P>
<P>
   ''You know,'' Ray laughed, ''those places with all the fake
plants where everybody goes to pick up girls.''
</P>
<P>
   And that was fine, she said, because they only wanted to get big
enough to open for Suzanne Vega. When they did that, they started
looking around for a gig far away from Atlanta. ''Maybe in Maine.''
They did that, too, going on to tour Maine and much of the world,
playing with many of their musical heroes, including Young, REM,
Sheryl Crowe, Sinead O'Connor, the Grateful Dead and Pete Seeger.
</P>
<P>
   What's ahead for the Indigo Girls?
</P>
<P>
   At 36, Ray is thinking about having a baby.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't make my mind up,'' she said. ''My brother has two
kids, I have a sister who has two kids, and I love them all dearly.
But it's a big, huge deal.''
</P>
<P>
   She doubts Sailers, who is nine months older, is interested in
motherhood for herself -- but maybe for her partner.
</P>
<P>
   ''Emily's in a serious relationship.''

<HEADLINE> Studies Show Grim French Prisons  </HEADLINE>
By CLAR NI CHONGHAILE
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Two studies published Wednesday paint a grim
picture of life in French penitentiaries, where prisoners often are
crowded into small cells and staff lack the means to rehabilitate
inmates to return to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   French prisons came under the media spotlight earlier this year
when a prison doctor published a book describing rapes,
self-mutilations and filthy conditions at Paris' La Sante prison.
</P>
<P>
   The graphic book by Veronique Vasseur caused a public outcry and
both houses of the French parliament created special inquiry
commissions.
</P>
<P>
   Their reports, the first on French prisons done by parliamentary
commissions in 125 years, were presented Wednesday. Both called for
major rejorms.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the lower house, or National Assembly, noted
''unsuitable, often unworthy, conditions of imprisonment, a
disorientated and unrecognized personnel, a lack of resources, the
absence of clearly defined objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   It said of France's 187 prisons, 108 are more than 80 years old.
''There are no three-star prisons,'' said the report's author,
Socialist lawmaker Jacques Floch.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are penitentiaries that have a minimum of dignity ...
Then there are other buildings that are that are unworthy of a
country like France,'' he told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Floch said there were 49,000 places in French jails and 52,000
prisoners. He stressed the main problem was not in the number of
places available but how they were used, citing examples of
prisoners crowded six to a cell made for two and forced to use an
open toilet.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are thousands of places like that in our country,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think 50,000 places is enough but these have to be used in
the best possible conditions and assure a minimum of dignity to
those in them,'' Floch said. ''These people are in these cells for
22 hours out of 24.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty percent of the prison population are awaiting trial -- one
of the highest levels in democratic countries, Floch said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers also said prisoners serving long sentences, minors
and those remanded in custody were mixed together.
</P>
<P>
   Vasseur's expose already has spurred government action. Justice
Minister Elisabeth Guigou said France would build three new prisons
and close some of the oldest ones. La Sante is to be renovated.
</P>
<P>
   But Floch said it is not just creating more jails. The question
of what can be done to help the staff prepare prisoners for release
needs to be addressed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The staff are no longer, and cannot be, key-carriers,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate commission drew up 30 urgent measures to reform the
penal system and remove the ''climate of despair'' in French
prisons.

<HEADLINE> Baltimore Asks: Why Do You Live Here?  </HEADLINE>
By SHEILA HOTCHKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Above the boarded-up rowhouses and battered
storefronts of west Baltimore, a red billboard praises the city to
anyone who looks up from streets rarely visited by tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ''So why do you live here?'' the billboard inquires of those
driving through an area where once elegant townhomes have given way
to drug dens. Seemingly undaunted by its surroundings, the sign
answers in larger letters: ''Pride.''
</P>
<P>
   The message makes 61-year-old Baltimore native James Henry smile
-- a genuine smile, not a cynical one.
</P>
<P>
   ''It tells people who criticize this city something,'' Henry
said, sitting on the concrete stoop of a typical Baltimore
rowhouse. ''I love this city because I was born here, because it's
my mother's home. I love my mother, and she loved this city.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what the ad campaign's creators hoped for when
they plastered various answers to the same question across 74
billboards and 90 buses -- to uncover the hidden pride Baltimoreans
take in their city.
</P>
<P>
   The city figures that if it can get its residents to think more
positively about Baltimore, others will, too.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30,000 responses to the billboards and accompanying
newspaper ads came in during the first four months of the campaign.
The responses praised, among other things, the city's low cost of
living, Orioles baseball and good seafood joints.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we're trying to get people to do is look beyond the
obvious,'' said John Phelan, the Cornerstone Advertising vice
president who created the campaign for the Greater Baltimore
Alliance. ''The disarming thing is if you ask someone the question,
almost no one is going to say something negative.''
</P>
<P>
   Focusing on the positive is a novel concept for Baltimore. The
city has gained national attention for a murder rate that eclipses
that of many larger cities and a syphilis rate that once made
Baltimore the target of Jay Leno's wisecracks for a week.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the derogatory remarks about the city come from an
unlikely source -- Baltimoreans themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ''We tend to overstate the negative and understate the
positive,'' said GBA President Ioanna Morfessis. ''I'm told this is
how Baltimore has always been. But it doesn't mean it always has to
be that way.''
</P>
<P>
   And if Baltimore residents need a reason to change, the GBA has
one for them: The city's self-critical ways reduce its ability to
attract new businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, 50 urban-renewal experts in town for a Johns Hopkins
University-sponsored conference concluded that, despite the success
of the Inner Harbor tourist area, Baltimore lacks the urban
self-esteem it needs to sell itself to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''For years, people have let themselves become a part of the
problem. I think now we're letting them be part of the solution,''
Phelan said. ''We wanted to issue people a sort of challenge
because they were creating the negative impression. And if you
create that, and you're so busy believing that, then why do you
live here?''
</P>
<P>
   Cornerstone Advertising posed that question throughout the city
and had people send in their responses, some of which were then
posted on billboards and advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Some were happy with Baltimore for what it is not: ''Because
it's not N.Y., D.C., Philly.'' But Baltimoreans found plenty to be
proud about: ''The infield at Preakness,'' ''Bertha's Mussels,''
''Cal Ripken,'' ''Big city, small town.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the answers strayed well outside the city limits:
''Weekends in O.C.'' (Ocean City), ''Sailing in Annapolis,'' and
''The Terps in March, baby'' (the University of Maryland's
basketball team, the Terrapins).
</P>
<P>
   One of the most frequent responses was recently elected Mayor
Martin O'Malley.
</P>
<P>
   Denise Whiting -- whose restaurant Cafe Hon is a shrine to
everything uniquely Baltimore, from marble steps to painted door
and window screens -- said she has loved the city since she was a
girl.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love the skyline when you're coming from the south,''
Whiting said. ''I love it in the spring, when the trees are all in
bloom.''
</P>
<P>
   Whiting hopes the O'Malley's administration signals a new era
for the city.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any kind of campaign that would promote the city and its
surrounding areas will keep the city moving forward,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Patrols Fight  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUSH KATIF JUNCTION, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Some days they mutter
curses in one another's direction. Occasionally they punch each
other out. And now and then, they face off with automatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was that Israeli and Palestinian troops would build
trust and keep the peace by patrolling together in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip. It hasn't quite worked out that way.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being a showcase for cooperation, the joint patrols
are a flashpoint for tensions -- at a time when the two sides are
embarking on a high-stakes push to meet a Sept. 13 deadline for
reaching a final peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton announced Wednesday he had invited the two
sides to a summit next week at the Camp David presidential retreat,
but negotiators from both sides will have to overcome deep mistrust
to reach an accord. Reflecting that, the mood on the ground in the
Palestinian lands -- and within the joint patrols -- is angry and
volatile.
</P>
<P>
   Troops from both sides say physical confrontations are
commonplace during their patrols, carried out in orange-flagged
jeeps that are a familiar sight on the dusty backroads of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   ''We beat the hell out of each other all the time,'' said the
commander of a four-man Israeli patrol as it made its rounds
through low sand dunes and scrubby brushland in central Gaza, with
a Palestinian jeep following closely behind.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't like the Israelis -- why should we?'' said a member of
the Palestinian patrol, a 19-year-old policeman named Mohammed. He
grew up in the squalid refugee camp of Khan Younis, not far from
where the jeeps were making their slow way along a roadway that
runs between a Palestinian village and a Jewish settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ''What happens almost every day is that there is some small
problem, some nonsense, and it turns into a big, big problem,''
said the Israeli patrol commander, a lieutenant in the paramilitary
border police who could only be identified by his first name, Ron.
''It's dangerous, and we know it, but we can't seem to stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Only last week, he said, he said, his men came to blows with
their Palestinian counterparts. He did not want to say what set off
the clash, but there was first an exchange of ''unpleasant words,''
then shoving, then a fistfight -- and finally ''like this on both
sides,'' he said, making the chik-chuk sound of automatic rifles
being cocked.
</P>
<P>
   On this day's patrol, the Israeli and Palestinian commanders got
out of their jeeps and conferred at several points during an
hourlong drive in Gaza. During the stops, their men milled about,
the two groups staying apart.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides sometimes communicate in Hebrew, which many
Palestinian policemen learned while jailed in Israel during the
intefadeh, or uprising. Lt. Ron knows Arabic, though, and generally
speaks it with his counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   Such gestures don't stop pent-up anger from boiling over. When
Lt. Ron started work 18 months ago on the joint patrol, he was
newly discharged from the army and had just finished a combat stint
in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to keep yourself under control if they point a
weapon at you -- you really have the impulse to shoot. It's
especially difficult for the younger guys,'' said the lieutenant,
who is 23.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli troops said Palestinian youngsters often lay in wait
for them, stoning their jeep once the Palestinian jeep had passed
by. The Palestinians, for their part, said they often encountered
hostility from Jewish settlers, which usually went unchallenged by
their Israeli patrol partners.
</P>
<P>
   The joint patrols were set up after the 1993 Oslo accords on the
theory that if the two sides had more day-to-day contact, their
acrimony might lessen. But both sides say they wonder whether
separation is a better option.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem isn't just between the (patrol) teams, it's
between the Israeli and Palestinian people,'' said Jalal Subeh, a
Palestinian shift commander at the liaison office that coordinates
the patrols.
</P>
<P>
   ''I need a new job,'' Lt. Ron said tiredly. ''This one isn't
doing anyone any good.''

<HEADLINE> Israeli Party To Leave Government  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli Interior Minister Natan Sharansky said
Wednesday he would take his party out of Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's government because he disagreed with Barak's peace
policies, a move that will further weaken Israel's fragile
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
   Sharansky said last month that he wouldn't support Barak's peace
moves unless he and other hawks in the Cabinet are given veto power
over Israeli concessions to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Sharanky's decision to pull out of the government could trigger
a similar move by the National Religious Party, which also opposes
Barak's proposed concessions to the Palestinians. That would put
Barak's coalition in the precarious position of controlling just 59
of parliament's 120 seats.
</P>
<P>
   ''The prime minister is travelling there without trying to make
consensus here,'' Sharansky said of Barak's decision to attend a
summit at the Camp David presidential retreat in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Barak would still have the numbers in parliament to pass peace
initiatives -- he would have the support of at least 20 legislators
who back his peace policies from the opposition benches. But
without a majority in parliament, he would remain open to the
demands of junior coalition parties, especially those of the
ultra-Orthodox Shas party.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister seemed undeterred.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even if I stay with nine ministers and a quarter of the
Knesset behind me, we will do it,'' Barak said earlier in Paris,
where he was meeting with French leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Sharansky wants Barak to convene a national unity government
that would include the hard-line opposition, and would slow the
peace process, while building support for any concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Sharansky said he would submit his resignation at the next
Cabinet meeting, on Sunday. After that, Israeli law allows him 48
hours to reverse his decision. The summit is to begin Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sharansky, who leads a Russian immigrants party that holds four
seats in parliament, said Barak could change his mind by opening up
discussions for a national unity government -- something Barak has
adamantly rejected until now.
</P>
<P>
   ''I turn to the prime minister at the last moment, before the
summit in Washington, hold a summit in Jerusalem,'' Sharansky said.
''Build a national consensus, build a national unity government.''

<HEADLINE> Illegal Logging Biz Grows in Russia  </HEADLINE>
By ANATOLY MEDETSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (AP) -- In the tall, dense forests of
Russia's Far East, small firms and family-run businesses turn out
one of the region's biggest exports: thick logs of oak, ash, spruce
and pine.
</P>
<P>
   They pile them onto the beds of secondhand Japanese trucks, and
send them to the ports of Nakhodka and Vladivostok. From there, the
wood is shipped to Japan, China and South Korea -- some of the
world's largest timber importers, which happen to be right in
Russia's backyard.
</P>
<P>
   In a region of high unemployment, the timber businesses provide
a surefire way to make a living. But they're illegal, and they're
thinning forests, damaging watersheds and could cause the
extinction of some species -- including the Korean pine,
environmental activists say.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is an impression that forest management is controlled
not by state agencies, but by criminal lords,'' the environmental
group Greenpeace said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Greenpeace drew attention to illegal logging this week when six
of its members chained themselves to a pile of timber being shipped
from Russia to Japan. The activists left the Russian freighter
Wednesday, saying they had succeeded in their goal of pressing the
Group of Eight industrial nations to move against illegal wood
imports. The G-8 holds a summit in Japan this month.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is one of the world's largest timber producers, felling
more than 3.5 billion cubic feet every year.
</P>
<P>
   The government puts some limits on logging to protect the
environment, but they are widely flouted. Poachers cut down about
776.9 million cubic feet each year -- or one-fifth the official
harvest, Greenpeace said in a study last year.
</P>
<P>
   Poached timber is easy to export, thanks to a lax 1999 export
license law.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, timber exports bring money to state coffers in the form
of customs duties.
</P>
<P>
   For Russia, ''to start fighting illegal timbering means to lose
the export duties and the budget revenue,'' said Vladimir Chuprov,
another Greenpeace activist.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy head of Russia's Federal Forestry Service, Dmitry
Odintsov, blamed the rise in illegal logging on the recent
reorganization of the forest service and local officials ignoring
timber laws. Some regions have timber procurement offices
''controlled by organized criminal groups engaged in illegal timber
exports,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted him saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Most poachers are villagers who lost their jobs when the
state-run timber companies shut down, said Anatoly Kabanets, an
official with the Natural Resources Ministry. Eighty to 100 percent
of adults in the villages in logging areas are unemployed and often
earn their living by destroying the nearby woodland, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They all do that,'' Kabanets said. ''Everyone has the
equipment in their backyard.''
</P>
<P>
   The Far East region of Primorye alone accounts for half of all
the valuable species of trees illicitly felled in Russia,
Greenpeace surveys show. Of 21.18 million cubic feet of valuable
wood that was harvested illegally across the country last year,
poachers here logged 10.6 million cubic feet, worth $24 million,
Greenpeace said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenpeace found that the businesses in the Far East hardly hide
their illicit operations.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the west of Russia, one has to make efforts to find illegal
sites because they are disguised. Here, everything is open and
shameless,'' said Alexei Morozov, a Greenpeace member who led
surveys in the Far East earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   During one two-week survey in June, his team ran across workers
cutting down trees in seven illegal logging sites.
</P>
<P>
   ''They log in broad daylight because no one really hunts for
them,'' Morozov said.
</P>
<P>
   The poachers fiercely defend their businesses. Last year, a bomb
destroyed the house of a timber company director who runs tracts
187 miles northeast of Vladivostok. The director, police said, had
tightly controlled his company's logging sites to prevent poaching.
No one was hurt in the blast.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists have also had run-ins with illegal loggers. In
one such confrontation last year, a Greenpeace activist was marking
illegally felled wood when he came face-to-face with a poacher and
his bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   After a short, menacing talk, the bodyguards escorted the
activist out of the area in a three-car convoy.
</P>
<P>
   ''One car trailed behind and one went ahead,'' Morozov said.
''And the third at times went by the side or toward us, turning
away before colliding.''

<HEADLINE> Sides Are Kept Apart in N. Ireland  </HEADLINE>
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- With water cannons and a high
steel wall, British soldiers and police worked Wednesday to prevent
Protestants from breaching their lines and reaching a nearby
Catholic neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Protestant rioting sparked by the tense standoff in Portadown,
30 miles southwest of Belfast, has been spreading and intensifying
each night, particularly in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Orange Order, Northern Ireland's once-dominant
Protestant brotherhood, said they were determined to wear down
British security forces and force them to permit a parade Sunday
down Garvaghy Road, the main Catholic section of Portadown. They
denied responsibility for any violence.
</P>
<P>
   Orange supporters brought Belfast traffic to a standstill at
evening rush hour Wednesday, throwing human blockades across more
than a dozen key roads, stranding thousands of motorists.
</P>
<P>
   Catholics in isolated districts complained that the Royal Ulster
Constabulary, itself the primary target, wasn't doing enough to
protect them. Several Catholic families in north Belfast reported
having to evacuate their homes overnight when Protestants outside
shouted death threats and broke windows.
</P>
<P>
   ''The RUC have been tolerating road and street blocks being set
up. There have been Catholics evicted from their homes by mobs. All
of this raises the temperature,'' said Sinn Fein leader Gerry
Adams, whose Irish Republican Army-linked party has long campaigned
against the predominantly Protestant police force.
</P>
<P>
   But other politicians lauded police and army efforts,
particularly in Portadown, where nine officers were reported
wounded after being bombarded with gasoline bombs, firecrackers,
slingshot projectiles and even acid as they stood their ground at
the spot where Protestant marches have been blocked since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''Petrol bombs, fireworks, ball bearings and acid squirted at
the police: Those are not the weapons of democrats or legitimate
protest. They are the weapons of the bully, and the bully will not
have his way,'' said Britain's minister for Northern Ireland, Peter
Mandelson.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson said he supported the police's use of water cannons on
the Protestant crowd late Tuesday, a measure avoided since 1996. He
said he would back any security measure designed to get Northern
Ireland through its ''recurring nightmare'' of march-fueled
violence.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, army engineers adopted a previously used tactic --
a 20-foot-high steel wall across the Orangemen's intended marching
path.
</P>
<P>
   This week's substantial Protestant rebellion against British
authority reflects both immediate anger at being forced to concede
symbolic ground to Catholics and wider opposition to key sections
of Northern Ireland's 2-year-old peace accord that have taken shape
in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Good Friday pact proposed creating a joint
Protestant-Catholic administration that included four parties,
including Sinn Fein and Protestant hard-liners from the Democratic
Unionist Party.
</P>
<P>
   The unlikely coalition was formed in December and, after being
suspended when the IRA initially refused to make any disarmament
commitments, resumed power in May.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democratic Unionists on Wednesday renewed efforts to
bring the power-sharing experiment tumbling down again.
</P>
<P>
   Their two ministers within the 12-post Cabinet announced they
would resign from their positions July 27 in a bid to increase
pressure on the more pragmatic Protestant party in the coalition,
the Ulster Unionists.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Unionists said they would keep hold of their
posts by immediately nominating two new party activists as
ministers -- and daring other parties to accept or reject them.
</P>
<P>
   ''The gloves are off. We're taking no more nonsense from
anybody,'' said Democratic Unionist leader Ian Paisley.
</P>
<P>
   Paisley pledged to kill the Good Friday agreement by obstructing
government operations -- embarrassing Ulster Unionist leader David
Trimble, and building Protestant opposition to his
compromise-minded policies.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble and moderate Catholic politician Seamus Mallon, who
jointly oversee the Cabinet, condemned Paisley's latest maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   ''How anyone can believe that rotating ministers regularly will
not harm the delivery of public services is a mystery,'' they said
in a joint statement. ''That is an abuse of the public interest and
a breach of the good faith which the two ministers pledged on
taking up office.''

<HEADLINE> Heat Wave Hits Southeast Europe  </HEADLINE>
By PATRICK QUINN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- A ''thermal invasion'' from the Sahara
desert has created a scorching heat wave in southeast Europe,
breaking century-old records, meteorologists said Wednesday, and
claiming at least eight lives across the region.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures reached as high as 111 degrees in Turkey, Bulgaria,
Greece, Romania and Italy on Wednesday, officials said, and many
regions were bracing for even hotter weather Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The average temperature for much of the Balkans at this time of
year varies between 86 degrees and 95 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   In Romania, hospitals were overcrowded with patients who
suffered heart attacks, heat-related shock or fainting spells. The
health ministry said ''many deaths'' occurred nationwide, but
released no figures.
</P>
<P>
   As temperatures climbed to 107 degrees, the Romanian government
told employees to stay home because many offices lack air
conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   The heat and dry conditions sparked a rash of fires; Romanian
firefighters fought 136 blazes over the past 24 hours. Two people
died and 26 others were injured, some seriously.
</P>
<P>
   In neighboring Bulgaria, temperatures hit their highest mark in
112 years, reaching a record 104 degrees in the capital of Sofia.
The heat has so far killed four elderly people suffering from heart
conditions and high blood pressure, Bulgarian health officials
reported, and at least 50 people were hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Meteorologists blame the heat on hot air masses moving north
from Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have the maximum of heat masses from the Sahara Desert in
Africa,'' said Greek meteorologist Nikos Kanderes. ''The thermal
invasion reached up to the northern Balkans.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanderes said a cooler air mass from central Europe may not
break through until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In Turkey, temperatures soared to 104 degrees in places, but
meteorologists predicted the real heat wave would hit the country
Thursday. The elderly and the sick were advised to stay indoors.
</P>
<P>
   In Macedonia, the thermometer in the capital Skopje showed 111
degrees, while hot winds blowing across the plains outside the city
forced residents indoors. Authorities shortened working hours and
advised people to stay indoors and drink a lot of water.
</P>
<P>
   Just across the Macedonian border, in the Yugoslav province of
Kosovo, temperatures soared to 108 degrees despite brisk winds that
provided little relief and filled the air in the capital Pristina
with dust and debris.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, the heat pushed aside
political issues as the pro-government Politika daily said Tuesday
was the hottest July 4 in 114 years, reaching 110 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service in Greece issued an emergency
bulletin warning people that temperatures would remain as high as
111 degrees on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   There were reports of two elderly people dying from heatstroke
in the northern Greek city of Ioannina. The country was also hit by
sporadic blackouts as power consumption hit record levels because
of the continuous use of air conditioners.
</P>
<P>
   Climate-controlled public auditoriums and indoor stadiums have
been opened to people without air conditioners, and the government
at the beginning of the week activated a civil defense plan to deal
with medical emergencies and possible brush or forest fires.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Ionian Sea in Italy, wildfires blazed amid a
blistering heat wave, burning a pine forest near Rome and eating up
large swaths in southern Italy and on the islands of Sicily and
Sardinia.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures rose as high as 104 degrees at the tip of the
Italian peninsula and high in Rome was a sweltering 97 degrees.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Kuwait Leader Has Lost Everything  </HEADLINE>
By DIANA ELIAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUWAIT (AP) -- For almost 10 years, Alaa Hussein's mother has
been regretting ever waking her eldest son that August morning so
that he help defend his country against invading Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   The Kuwaiti reservist army officer was captured by Iraqis before
he even made it to a camp where Kuwaiti troops were assembling in
1990. He was picked to head a puppet ''interim Cabinet'' that was
disbanded less than a week later, when Baghdad annexed its small
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1991 Gulf War forced Iraq out of Kuwait, Hussein was
in exile. A court in his homeland ruled him a traitor in 1993 and
sentenced him to death in absentia.
</P>
<P>
   His 57-year-old mother, Munira al-Humaidi, lifted her black
headdress to show a head bald but for a few white hairs. ''I lost
it all because of grief,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A court is to rule July 9 on an appeal by Hussein, after his
1993 conviction and death sentence were upheld in May.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein, who had been living in exile in Norway since 1998,
returned with his four children in January to contest the 1993 in
absentia conviction. He said he wanted to prove he had been forced
by Iraqi soldiers to take the puppet leadership post. Instead, the
court dismissed his arguments with its May ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have lost confidence in everything,'' the 41-year-old
Hussein told The Associated Press, joining a recent interview at
his sister's apartment through a phone call from prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now, I'm living among drug smugglers and killers who make fun
of me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein had broken down in tears when he spoke in court, trying
to explain that although his mother was Iraqi and he studied in a
Baghdad university before the 1990 invasion, he had no connections
to the ruling Baath Party.
</P>
<P>
   Public prosecutors have said Hussein could not produce any
evidence that he was forced to take the job.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein said the Iraqis would not let him leave Iraq after
Kuwait was liberated, though eight other members of the puppet
Cabinet, who were also Kuwaiti prisoners, were allowed to go home.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his fellow Cabinet members, who were cleared of any
wrongdoing upon their return, told the court they were not on good
terms with him in Iraq and he used to give them orders and threaten
them with death if they didn't comply. One said Hussein didn't show
any excitement when Iraq was driven from Kuwait, and seemed to
believe Iraq would win the Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein's children have been living with their grandparents,
aunts and uncles since their sudden return from Norway.
</P>
<P>
   ''We never thought they would do this to him. He is a war
prisoner not a traitor,'' said 14-year-old Saad. He said that in
Iraq and in Norway, his father was always sad and silent and
couldn't wait to come back to Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein's only daughter, Hoda, said she didn't want to go to
school in Kuwait, where she would have to hear other children
insulting her father.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-aged Hoda and her three brothers have asked to see the
emir, Sheik Jaber Al Ahmed Al Sabah, to ask for a pardon. It is
unlikely the ruler would consider the request before a final
verdict. Hussein has one other appeal beyond the court that is to
rule July 9.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein said he wanted Hoda, Saad, and the younger boys, Nawar,
7, and Mohammad, 10, to go back to Norway to live with their
stepmother. He married Sonya Shamoun, an Iraqi, after divorcing his
first wife in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have deprived my children of their father, they shouldn't
deprive them of their mother too,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Disbarment Goes to New Judge  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID A. LIEB
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A judge who helped write Arkansas'
ethics laws stepped aside from hearing President Clinton's
disbarment trial Wednesday, and the case fell to a judge appointed
by the state's Republican governor just last month.
</P>
<P>
   Leon Johnson became a judge on June 2, replacing one ousted for
misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   Since the state Supreme Court's disciplinary committee sued
Clinton on Friday to strip him of his license to practice law, four
judges assigned to preside at the trial have stepped aside, all
citing ties to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, as governor of Arkansas, had appointed three of them to
judgeships. The fourth judge, Chris Piazza, said in stepping aside
Wednesday that when he was a local prosecutor and Clinton was
governor, Clinton had named him to a panel that drafted the state's
ethics laws.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was appointed by Republican Gov. Mike Huckabee to hold
the judgeship until the end of the year. If the disbarment case is
not resolved by then, it will fall to his successor, who will be
elected in November.
</P>
<P>
   No trial date has been set.
</P>
<P>
   The disciplinary committee said Clinton is unfit to be a lawyer
for denying during the Paula Jones sexual harassment case that he
had a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton lawyer David Kendall has said the president will fight
disbarment ''vigorously.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Discusses Iranian Jews  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- American Jewish leaders explored with
President Clinton on Wednesday how to pressure Iran to release 10
Jewish men sentenced to prison on espionage charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was an hourlong exploration of the facts; to talk about
possible pressure points,'' said Malcolm I. Hoenlein, executive
chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish
Organizations. ''The purpose was to declare to the world that the
United States is determined to bring about the release of these
innocent men.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not appear before reporters after the meeting.
Hoenlein said Clinton called the charges against the 10
Iranian-Jewish men unjust and the process used to convict them
unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Also attending the White House meeting were first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton, the Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate in New
York, and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
</P>
<P>
   Family members of three of the 10 convicted Iranian-Jewish
prisoners also were present.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 were sentenced to prison terms ranging from four to 13
years; Hoenlein said there is concern that the prisoners will not
survive their sentences because of harsh prison conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.S. is the leader of the free world and does have some
moral persuasion'' to bring to bear, Hoenlein said. ''The president
is fully committed to doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's verdict drew condemnation from Israel, which denied
that the convicted men were spies, and from Clinton, who said he
was ''deeply disappointed'' that Iran appeared to have treated the
men unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 men were sentenced by an Iranian judge who acted as both
prosecutor and jury.
</P>
<P>
   Hoenlein said earlier in the week that he thought international
pressure may have helped avert death penalty sentences for the men
and could have a positive effect on the appeals process.

<HEADLINE> Tech Stocks Drag Market Down  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks were mostly lower Wednesday
after Computer Associates became the latest company to warn that
profits won't meet expectations. But strength in financial stocks
pulled the Dow Jones industrial average up from earlier lows.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the blue-chip Dow average
was down 8.13 at 10,552.54.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 10.43 at 1,458.89, and the Nasdaq composite index
was down 71.90 at 3,920.03.
</P>
<P>
   Computer Associates plummeted $21.938 to $29.188, a 43 percent
drop. Shortly after midnight Tuesday, the company surprised Wall
Street analysts by warning that its fiscal first-quarter results
would badly miss expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The warning raised fears that other technology companies will
also issue disappointing results when the earnings reporting season
goes into full gear later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, BMC Software said Wednesday morning that fiscal
first-quarter earnings will be 18 to 21 cents a share, compared
with analysts' consensus of 46 cents. Its shares fell $13.25 to
$22.25 on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   ''The damage is fairly well concentrated in the technology
stocks,'' said William Meehan, chief market analyst for Cantor
Fitzgerald. ''It's feeding on itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the largest technology companies fell prey to investors'
worries about earnings. IBM fell $7.188 to $102.688 and Intel fell
$3.563 to $133.313.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Oracle fell $5.875 to $74.313 after J.P. Morgan analyst
William Epifanio downgraded the stock to ''market performer'' from
''buy.'' Epifanio cited concerns over Oracle's plan for management
succession after president and chief operating officer Ray Lane
stepped down last week.
</P>
<P>
   Oil stocks were also lower in the first trading session since
Saudi Arabia signaled it may soon begin producing an additional
half-million barrels a day. The Saudis said in a statement Monday
they will provide higher production within a few days if crude
prices don't quickly head lower toward their preferred price of
about $25 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon Mobil fell $1.984 to $77.563.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks improved on the news that a key gauge of future
economic activity fell in May, suggesting that the Federal
Reserve's efforts to put the brakes on economic expansion are
working.
</P>
<P>
   The Index of Leading Economic Indicators declined by 0.1
percent, primarily because of a pullback in manufacturing and a
decline in stock prices. The report raised some hopes that the Fed
will leave rates unchanged at its next meeting on Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan rose $1.688 to $117.438.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-6 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 624.66 million
shares, compared with 645.44 million shares at the same time
Monday. The stock market was closed on Tuesday for the Independence
Day holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 4.05 to 519.99.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Target Human Smugglers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- China's Fujian province has tightened border
controls in a bid to stop human smugglers, following the deaths of
58 Chinese illegal migrants during an attempt to reach Britain last
month, state media reported.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in coastal Fujian, where the smuggling trade is
based, have intensified their crackdown on the smugglers, known as
snakeheads, since the migrants were found dead in the back of a
truck in the British port of Dover, the government's Xinhua News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   It said the provincial government has tightened control on exit
applications and ''called for rapid development of the economy to
solve surplus labor and to improve people's living standard,'' the
report said. Stricter supervision of shipping and fishing vessels
off the Fujian coast has also been enforced, Xinhua said.
</P>
<P>
   But Xinhua added that the numbers of human smuggling cases
investigated so far this year are down from the first half of 1999,
despite a pair of three-month long crackdowns leading to the
arrests of 289 people on suspicion of organizing illegal passages.
</P>
<P>
   The report follows the visit to Fujian this week by Doris
Meissner, commissioner of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service, who said she hoped to improve communication and
cooperation between the United States and China in combatting
illegal migration. Prior to her visit, Meissner said in Beijing
that snakeheads were becoming increasingly sophisticated and had
largely abandoned crude methods of cramming would-be-migrants
aboard creaky vessels for the sea passage.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Fujian courts handled 296 cases involving illegal
migration. Ninety-seven people were sentenced to two years or more
in prison, Xinhua said.

<HEADLINE> Gas-Powered Shoes in Russia  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW KRAMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- His fashion sense isn't as elegant as Gucci's, but
Roman Kunikov says his gasoline-powered boots are a step forward in
footwear -- as much as 13 feet per stride.
</P>
<P>
   Kunikov is one of the professors at a Russian engineering
institute who designed the boots that were tested Tuesday in a
public square in Ufa, 750 miles southeast of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The test showed that wearers can achieve speeds of up to 25 mph,
Kunikov said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   The boots incorporate one-foot pistons that strap along the calf
and fire downward after the wearer steps down, pushing a metal
plate away from the bottom of the shoe -- and the wearer up into the
air.
</P>
<P>
   The shoe works in a rhythm with the wearer's step. As he steps
down, his body weight resets the piston, which then fires and
pushes him on his way. The plate is connected to the sole of the
shoe by metal rods that work as shock absorbers. The shoes use
ordinary gasoline, Kunikov said.
</P>
<P>
   ''A person can move with significant jumps or strides,'' said
Kunikov, a professor at the Ufa Aviation Technical University.
</P>
<P>
   The university formerly worked on defense contracts, but when
defense budgets shriveled, Ufa university went searching for a
niche in the capitalist economy.
</P>
<P>
   The shoes weigh about two pounds each, including a fuel tank,
tiny carburetor, spark plug and wires and pipes. Kunikov said there
have not been any accidents so far.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he would continue to refine his product.
</P>
<P>
   ''We aren't standing in one place,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Russian Journalists Name Enemies  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW KRAMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Complaining they are increasingly made to feel
like enemies of the state, a group of Russian journalists struck
back Wednesday by publishing a blacklist of their own: a list of
''enemies of the press.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials on the list were faulted for affronts
ranging from refusing to speak to the press to failing to protect
the lives of journalists.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Union of Journalists, the country's largest trade
group for members of the news media, said it put together the list
to draw attention to individual officials who blocked the press'
efforts to serve as watchdogs for Russia's fledgling democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not an anonymous trend. There are real people behind
this,'' said Union Secretary Igor Yakovenko.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the list was Russia's press and information
minister Mikhail Lesin, who was criticized for outlawing television
broadcasts of interviews with rebel leaders in the break away
republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   President Vladimir Putin, a former KGB colonel, came in second,
tied with the country's prosecutor general, Vladimir Ustinov.
</P>
<P>
   While Putin insists press freedoms are crucial to democracy, he
has been widely criticized for the arrest last month of media
tycoon Vladimir Gusinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Another journalist, Radio Liberty correspondent Andrei Babitsky,
was also detained in January by secret service agents in Chechnya
for not having proper accreditation and is now barred from leaving
Moscow. His reports contained interviews with Chechen rebels, and
he gave graphic accounts of Russian atrocities against Chechen
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights advocates said that in both cases, the men were
targeted for being critical of the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   ''Especially since Putin came to power, we see the government
trying to limit the rights of journalists,'' said Oleg Panfilov,
director of the Center for Journalism in Extreme Situations, a
Moscow-based rights group.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the list was Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, president of the
Russian republic of Kalmykia. In 1998, Larisa Yudina, the editor of
an opposition newspaper in Kalmykia, was found stabbed to death
after reporting on alleged misuse of public funds.
</P>
<P>
   Former regional government officials have been convicted of the
killing. Ilyumzhinov has denied involvement.

<HEADLINE> Retail executive Alan Fortunoff dies at 67  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   	   OLD WESTBURY, N.Y. (AP) - Alan Fortunoff, president and CEO of
the Fortunoff retail chain, has died. He was 67.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunoff died in his sleep at his Old Westbury home on Tuesday
night of complications from cancer, said his spokesman, Gary Lewi.
</P>
<P>
   He started out sweeping floors and helping customers at his
family's housewares shop in Brooklyn. As customers began leaving
the city for the suburbs in the 1960s, the Fortunoffs moved their
store to Long Island, luring customers with a promise of ''everyday
low prices'' on goods ranging from diamonds and pearls to towels
and bathmats.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunoff built his family's company into a chain of popular
stores, opening outlets in New Jersey and on Fifth Avenue in
Manhattan. He helped create The Mall at The Source near his
Westbury store to draw shoppers to the area.
</P>
<P>
   ''Alan was committed to our future both as a corporate family
and as a retail leader,'' his family said in a statement. ''The
management depth and executive culture that he helped create will
not only sustain Fortunoff today but allow it to continue to grow
in the years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunoff, who earned a law degree at New York University, was a
trustee of the NYU Law Center Foundation and a member of the Dean's
Advisory Council at NYU's Stern School of Business. He helped fund
the Fortunoff Holocaust Archives at Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunoff is survived by his wife, Helene, four daughters and
two sons.
</P>
<P>
   A funeral is planned for 1 p.m. Thursday at Temple Sinai in
Roslyn Heights.

<HEADLINE> Dow Loses 43; Nasdaq Falls 99  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks were mostly lower Wednesday
after Computer Associates became the latest company to warn that
profits won't meet expectations. An analyst's cautious outlook on
the semiconductor sector added to the technology sector's woes.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the
blue-chip Dow average was down 42.78 at 10,517.89.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 18.28 at 1,451.04, and the Nasdaq composite index
was down 98.73 at 3,893.20.
</P>
<P>
   Computer Associates plummeted $22.25 to $28.875, a 44 percent
drop. Shortly after midnight Tuesday, the company surprised Wall
Street analysts by warning that its fiscal first-quarter results
would badly miss expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The warning raised fears that other technology companies will
also issue disappointing results when the earnings reporting season
goes into full gear later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, BMC Software said Wednesday morning that fiscal
first-quarter earnings will be 18 to 21 cents a share, compared
with analysts' consensus of 46 cents. Its shares fell $13.688 to
$21.813 on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   ''The damage is fairly well concentrated in the technology
stocks,'' said William Meehan, chief market analyst for Cantor
Fitzgerald. ''It's feeding on itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the largest technology companies fell prey to investors'
worries about earnings. IBM fell $8.25 to $101.625.
</P>
<P>
   The semiconductor sector tumbled after Salomon Smith Barney
analyst Jonathan Joseph said a decline in sector shipments and
prices was evidence of a growth slowdown over the next six to nine
months. Intel, a bellwether for the group, fell $4.313 to $132.563
even though Joseph didn't single it out.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Oracle fell $6.938 to $73.25 after J.P. Morgan analyst
William Epifanio downgraded the stock to ''market performer'' from
''buy.'' Epifanio cited concerns over Oracle's plan for management
succession after president and chief operating officer Ray Lane
stepped down last week.
</P>
<P>
   Oil stocks were also lower in the first trading session since
Saudi Arabia signaled it may soon begin producing an additional
half-million barrels a day. The Saudis said in a statement Monday
they will provide higher production within a few days if crude
prices don't quickly head lower toward their preferred price of
about $25 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon Mobil fell $2.297 to $77.25.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks improved on the news that a key gauge of future
economic activity fell in May, suggesting that the Federal
Reserve's efforts to put the brakes on economic expansion are
working.
</P>
<P>
   The Index of Leading Economic Indicators declined by 0.1
percent, primarily because of a pullback in manufacturing and a
decline in stock prices. The report raised some hopes that the Fed
will leave rates unchanged at its next meeting on Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan rose 81.25 cents to $116.563.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a slender margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 735.15 million
shares, slightly behind average. The stock market was closed on
Tuesday for the Independence Day holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 5.39 to 518.65.

<HEADLINE> Audit: IRS Owes Taxpayers $25M  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thousands of taxpayers overpaid $25 million in
income taxes that should have been credited to their accounts or
refunded by the Internal Revenue Service, according to an
independent audit that cites computer problems as the main culprit.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands more individuals, families and businesses forfeited
their rights to refunds or credits, or were at risk of doing so,
that totaled $335 million. These taxpayers failed to file late tax
returns in time for legal deadlines to qualify for the money.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS says it has returned or credited the money owed and is
fixing the problem. Still, some taxpayers mistakenly got IRS
notices demanding taxes already paid or were forced to deal with
IRS liens.
</P>
<P>
   The audit by the independent Treasury Inspector General for Tax
Administration, David C. Williams, examined 426,000 tax payments,
totaling $360 million, from 240,000 taxpayers that had been
transferred as of March 1999 to the IRS Excess Collections Account.
Payments are deposited into this account when the IRS is unable to
match them with a tax return, usually because it is late.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $360 million, the audit found that:
</P>
<P>
   --About $25 million, or 29,820 payments, immediately should have
been refunded or credited to taxpayers who filed returns late but
within the legal requirement of generally three years after the
initial due date -- usually April 15 of a given year. The audit did
not break down how many taxpayers that involved.
</P>
<P>
   --Taxpayers forfeited $162 million, or 191,700 payments, because
they did not get a return to the IRS within the three-year window
necessary to claim a refund or to credit the payment toward another
tax year.
</P>
<P>
   --No tax return had been filed for $173 million, or 204,480
payments. But these taxpayers still could get their credit or
refund if they took action quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Tax law requires a taxpayer to file a claim for a credit or
refund of an overpayment within three years after a return is filed
or two years after the tax was paid, whichever is later. If no tax
is due, the claim must be made within two years of the payment.
</P>
<P>
   The chief culprit is the main IRS computer, which is not linked
directly to computers in the agency's 10 service centers, where
records of payment transfers to the excess account are kept.
</P>
<P>
   When a late return is filed, the computer containing a
taxpayer's main account has no record of the previous payments and
the IRS sends out a notice demanding the money. ''This control
weakness made it appear that these taxpayers had underpaid their
tax liabilities,'' the auditors found.
</P>
<P>
   An IRS study from 1995 that was cited by auditors said it was
''unproductive'' to spend time tracking down people who failed to
file tax returns if they did not owe taxes and that agents
sometimes transferred payments to the excess accounts to reduce the
number of unresolved cases.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the auditors found that ''many taxpayers received
inaccurate or erroneous balance due notices, sometimes taxpayers
made additional payments in excess of their tax liabilities and, in
a few instances, taxpayers were subjected to federal tax liens.''
</P>
<P>
   IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti responded in a letter that
computers are being modified to prevent transfers into the excess
payment account until the three-year refund limit has expired.
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti also said the IRS will send ''periodic letters to
taxpayers with credits to remind them to file a return to receive a
credit or refund.''
</P>
<P>
   He questioned the $25 million in credits and refunds estimated
by the audit, saying an examination of two of the 10 service
centers uncovered 1,398 payments due totaling about $1.7 million.
If that rate held for the other centers, Rossotti said, the total
credited back to taxpayers would amount to about $8.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The auditors said the discrepancy could be attributed to major
differences between service centers in crediting taxpayer
overpayments and responses by many taxpayers to inaccurate balance
notices they received last year.

<HEADLINE> Lazio: Hillary Clinton has ''embarrassed our country''  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Republican candidate Rick Lazio, in a
fund-raising letter that came to light Wednesday, says his U.S.
Senate rival ''Hillary Clinton and her husband have embarrassed our
country and disgraced their powerful posts.''
</P>
<P>
   In his harshest attack to date on the first lady, the
congressman from Long Island writes that ''she covets power and
control and thinks she should be dictating how other people run
their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ''No other Senate hopeful enjoys a liberal national press that
hangs on her every word and treats her never-ending soap opera of
scandals as 'irrelevant' and 'yesterday's news,''' the four-page
letter adds.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate two-page letter coordinated with the Lazio
campaign, millionaire publisher Steve Forbes - whose former
political guru, Bill Dal Col, is now Lazio's campaign manager -
asks his former presidential campaign supporters to open their
checkbooks for the congressman.
</P>
<P>
   ''Deep down, Hillary knows that her wild-eyed radical leftist
views will repel the voters,'' Forbes writes. ''That's why she
engages in a predictable pattern of shameless hypocrisy, perpetual
pandering and cruel scapegoating against her opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   ''While she's a liberal extremist, Rick's a dyed-in-the-wool
conservative,'' Forbes adds, even though Lazio's campaign says the
candidate is a moderate. ''While she's ricocheted from one scandal
to another, Rick holds himself to the highest ethical standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Lazio letter, Clinton campaign spokesman Howard
Wolfson said, ''We are confident that New Yorkers will reject Rick
Lazio's campaign of personal insults in favor of Hillary's campaign
of issue differences and real ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   During a more than 20-minute news conference aboard a campaign
bus in northern New York, Lazio acted as if he really wasn't
familiar with his own fund-raising letter. And, he said, ''That's
not part of our media campaign. That's not what I'm talking about
on the stump ... And frankly, these letters are written, you know,
not by me. I'm not disavowing it, but they're not written by me.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I just think that both Mrs. Clinton and the President have got
pretty significant liabilities that are well known by the public,''
Lazio added.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, declaring that Lazio's candidacy is the product of
''Republican Party kingmakers,'' the first lady was out with her
own direct-mail appeal asking for ''a special donation'' to keep up
her attacks on the congressman from Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our opponents understand how critical the next few weeks will
be in defining this contest. So do I,'' the first lady wrote in a
one-page appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, Clinton and her supporters launched six
television advertisements attacking Lazio's congressional record
and his stand on issues in an attempt to ''define'' Lazio for the
electorate before he has a chance to do that in a more positive
way.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio only entered the race on May 20 after Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani quit the contest, saying he had to deal with his newly
diagnosed prostate cancer. Lazio's substitute candidacy was quickly
endorsed by Gov. George Pataki and state GOP Chairman William
Powers, who effectively shut the door on other possible GOP
contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ''The vast right-wing conspiracy rides again,'' Lazio campaign
spokesman Dan McLagan said when asked about Clinton's letter. ''I
don't think even she believes this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   In her letter, Clinton reiterates her public theme that ''this
campaign is not about me or my opponent.'' She then quickly makes
it clear she thinks the race is about her and her opponent, or at
least where they stand on the issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''I support licensing and registration of handguns. He
doesn't,'' she writes. ''He has voted against the right to choose
(abortion) for low income women, even in cases of rape and incest.
I would never vote that way.''
</P>
<P>
   McLagan dismissed the letter as another example that the first
lady's ''campaign has been one of mudslinging distortions ... It's
sad, but not unexpected.''
</P>
<P>
   Defending Lazio's letter, McLagan said, ''There were never any
unanswered questions surrounding Barbara Bush. There are no
independent counsel reports on Rosalyn Carter. Under previous
administrations, the Lincoln Bedroom wasn't treated like Motel 6.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, who is in the midst of a five-day bus tour across the
state, has sent out several fund-raising letters in recent days.
One, addressed to ''Dear Fellow New Yorker,'' doesn't mention the
White House scandals associated with the Clinton administration. A
''Dear Friend'' letter does.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe elective office is a sacred trust that obligates us
to set the highest personal standards,'' Lazio writes in the
harsher of the two letters. ''She believes elective office is
something she deserves and is owed and should anyone question her
or her husband's integrity, she lashes out with ferocity at her
accusers.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Lazio had said the race would not be about Bill Clinton
or other politicians, but about he and the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ''This campaign for the United States Senate is not going to be
about Newt Gingrich and it's not going to be about Bill Clinton,''
he told ABC's ''This Week'' Sunday morning show on May 21.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Lazio letters actually made its way to Clinton
campaign headquarters in New York City, addressed to ''Bill
Rodham.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have anybody here by that name,'' Clinton campaign
spokesman Howard Wolfson said.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Allies Want Him To Stay  </HEADLINE>
By JOVANA GEC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- President Slobodan Milosevic's
allies asked parliament Wednesday to make changes to the Yugoslav
constitution that legal experts say could enable Milosevic to seek
re-election after his term expires next year.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals also include changes in the election of the
federal parliament -- a move that could downgrade the position of
Montenegro, Serbia's smaller, pro-Western partner in the Yugoslav
federation.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move could push the republic toward declaring
independence or risk coming increasingly dominated by Milosevic's
central government.
</P>
<P>
   According to the official Tanjug news agency, deputies from
Milosevic's ruling coalition proposed that the president of
Yugoslavia be elected directly by the voters rather than appointed
by the assembly's two chambers.
</P>
<P>
   That was the system used when Milosevic became Yugoslav
president in 1997. Parliament, which is controlled by Milosevic,
takes up the issue Thursday. Changes in the constitution require
only parliamentary approval.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's allies argued that direct election conferred ''the
greatest possible democratic legitimacy'' to the institution of the
president.
</P>
<P>
   However, some legal experts said the proposal paves the way for
the re-election of Milosevic, who under the present system is
constitutionally barred from a second term. By changing the
election rules, Milosevic's allies could argue that the current ban
on him running again does not apply.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has been indicted by the international war crimes
tribunal in The Hague for atrocities committed during the crackdown
in Kosovo, which triggered the 78-day NATO bombing campaign.
Staying in power would be Milosevic's best guarantee against
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also calls for direct election of deputies in the
upper chamber of the Yugoslav parliament -- which includes 20
deputies from Serbia and 20 from Montenegro. Deputies are currently
elected by the parliaments of both republics.
</P>
<P>
   Many Montenegrin candidates, however, would stand little chance
since their republic has only 600,000 people compared with 10
million in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro's reformist leadership has already made several steps
toward independence from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ''This (proposal) is the last act of the tragic political
destruction,'' warned a top Montenegrin official, Miodrag Vukovic.
''What remains is for Montenegro to defend itself, its state,
democratic structures and its right to future.''
</P>
<P>
   Serbian opposition leader Zoran Djindjic called the plan ''a
most serious blow for the federal state because it will destroy
constitutional equality between Serbia and Montenegro.''
</P>
<P>
   Another opposition leader, Vuk Draskovic, said the move
constituted ''a form of legal state terrorism and an attack on the
constitution.''

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Tony Bennett turned wedding singer last weekend,
dropping by a ballroom reception with a smile and a song: ''I Left
my Heart in San Francisco,'' of course.
</P>
<P>
   The 73-year-old crooner had just finished a sold-out show in
Manchester, England, and was returning to his room at a posh hotel
when the bride's mother approached him for the favor.
</P>
<P>
   ''At first, we didn't think he was going to do it. Then, just
before he went to bed, he got up and sang,'' a Bennett spokeswoman
said in Wednesday's New York Post.
</P>
<P>
   Mom was almost in tears, the cuddling couple were amazed, and
the guests sang along with Bennett, she said.

<HEADLINE> 'N Sync's Bass Draws Teen Crowd  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- He was visible for less than half a
minute, and that was long enough to drive the girls into a frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Bass of the dreamy vocal group 'N Sync appeared at the Fun
Fourth Festival on Tuesday to introduce country singer Meredith
Edwards, a childhood friend and the first artist signed to his
record label.
</P>
<P>
   Well before his scheduled appearance, girls crowded the sides of
the stage and, blocked by police tape, stared longingly at his tour
bus.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll just follow him wherever we can,'' said 13-year-old
Amanda Downes, who rushed the stage with a 12-year-old friend.
</P>
<P>
   When he finally appeared, Bass greeted the crowd, introduced
Edwards, waved and left the stage. It lasted 26 seconds.

<HEADLINE> Fire Guts 'Twin Peaks' Restaurant  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH BEND, Wash. (AP) -- A restaurant made famous in the quirky
and macabre ''Twin Peaks'' TV series has met with a frightening
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Fire gutted the rear third of the building Sunday. Damage was
put at $250,000. Investigators found a back window broken out.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Twede said someone broke in, stole about $450 and set fire
to his business.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no idea who would burn my restaurant down,'' Twede
said. ''Take my money, that's one thing, but burning down the
restaurant affects a lot of people. Why would someone do that?''
</P>
<P>
   Filmed in the North Bend-Snoqualmie area, a 30-mile drive east
of Seattle, ''Twin Peaks'' won a dedicated cult following during
its two-year run. In the series, the Mar-T Cafe stood in for the
Double-R Diner.
</P>
<P>
   Twede hopes to be back in business before the third annual Twin
Peaks Festival in August, which includes a coffee-and-pie stop at
the cafe.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- A woman gave birth in a courtroom Wednesday,
minutes after she was sentenced to three years in prison with hard
labor, police officials said. She promptly named her baby girl
''Felony.''
</P>
<P>
   Amal Ahmed Farran, 35 and nine months pregnant, went into labor
while still inside the defendants' cage after she heard her
sentence, prompting other women in the cage to shout for help, said
the officials.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Abdel-Munem Othman of the criminal court of the
Mediterranean port city of Damietta ordered police to bring a
doctor to help with the delivery.
</P>
<P>
   It was on the advice of fellow women defendants in the courtroom
that Farran, who was convicted on drug trafficking charges, named
the baby Ginaya, the Arabic word for felony.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Othman ordered mother and baby to be taken to hospital and
put under observation there for several days, according to the
police officials. Farran will be able to keep Ginaya in jail with
her for the entire duration of her prison term. Under Egyptian law,
mothers can keep their children in jail with them until they reach
the age of four.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MARINELAND, Fla. (AP) -- This tiny coastal town, which began as a
movie studio in the 1930s, is returning to its tinsel glory.
</P>
<P>
   McGee Street Productions will film a made-for-TV love story in
Marineland, sponsored by Hallmark Cards.
</P>
<P>
   The film should air on CBS sometime in 2001, Hallmark
spokeswoman Ellen Nesselrode said Tuesday. Filming is to begin in
mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   Filmmakers said they were looking for a remote location to
recreate the look of 1960s Florida. Marineland is on an island in
northeastern Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, based on the novel ''The Flamingo Rising'' by Larry
Baker, is about a Romeo-and-Juliet-style romance between the son
and daughter of rival businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   The town got its start in the 1930s as the home of the Marine
Studios. Filmmakers built an aquarium, which they called an
''oceanarium,'' so they could shoot underwater scenes.

<HEADLINE> Canadian tobacco lawsuit goes up in smoke in U.S. Court  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM KATES
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - The Canadian government is considering
what course to take after a U.S. federal judge dismissed a novel $1
billion lawsuit alleging that R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.
masterminded a booming smuggling trade to evade millions of dollars
in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In a 55-page decision, U.S. District Judge Thomas McAvoy ruled
that Canada was treading on grounds where American courts had no
jurisdiction - at least under current law.
</P>
<P>
   McAvoy said the lawsuit ran afoul of an 18th-century English
common law rule adopted by the United States that prohibits its
courts from being used to collect another country's revenue. The
so-called ''Revenue Rule'' has been criticized as outdated in an
era of closely linked economies and tax treaties and McAvoy
suggested in his ruling that he would like to see a higher court
consider its validity.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a lengthy and complex ruling ... but the judge did not
address the factual merits of the case,'' said Gordon Bourgard, a
general counsel for the Canadian justice department. ''Obviously,
we are disappointed but his decision was based on a rule of law
that has been called into question by several courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourgard said on Wednesday that the Canadian government is
reviewing its options, which include appealing the decision in the
U.S. courts or pursuing the case in the Canadian judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   With great fanfare, the Canadian government filed its
unprecedented civil lawsuit in December in the United States, where
it could pursue triple damages under the federal Racketeering
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Bourgard said the United
States' stronger mail and wire fraud statutes also prompted
Canada's decision to file the lawsuit in America.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleged that RJR and related companies set up an
elaborate network of smugglers and a shell company - Northern
Brands International - to flood Canada with cheap cigarettes after
the government doubled taxes and duties on tobacco in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   It further alleged that a Canadian subsidiary of Reynolds,
RJR-Macdonald Inc., used the Canadian Tobacco Manufacturing
Council, a trade group, to blame organized crime for the smuggling
while pretending it was trying to stop the activity.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the ring smuggled $687 million worth of
cigarettes and alcohol into Canada from 1991 to 1997 through the
St. Regis Mohawk Reservation that straddles the border in northern
New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two dozen people were convicted in connection with the
ring, including several prominent Mohawk businessmen, a former
tribal chief and a top tobacco executive with Northern Brands.
</P>
<P>
   RJR has steadfastly denied it played any role in encouraging the
smuggling ring.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are pleased that the federal court dismissed this case,
which should have never been brought in the first place,'' the
North Carolina-based tobacco company said in a statement issued
Wednesday. ''R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. hopes that the dismissal
will put an end to this matter once and for all.''
</P>
<P>
   In his decision issued Friday, McAvoy said Canada's lawsuit
would draw the U.S. court into ''forbidden waters reserved
exclusively to the legislative and executive branches'' of the U.S.
government that are responsible for establishing and conducting
international relations. The U.S. court would be required to pass
on the validity of, and enforce, Canadian revenue laws, the judge
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Enforcing foreign revenue laws is precisely the type of
meddling in foreign affairs the revenue rule forbids,'' McAvoy
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The case marked the first time a foreign government used the
civil provisions of the U.S. anti-racketeering law to target a
tobacco company for alleged cigarette smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Colombia followed in Canada's footsteps, filing a
$3-billion anti-racketeering suit in New York federal court against
the world's largest tobacco multinational, Philip Morris Companies
Inc., for lost tax revenue because of alleged smuggling and alleged
laundering of drug money.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Ecuador filed a lawsuit in federal court in Florida
against more than a dozen U.S. tobacco companies, including Philip
Morris and RJR, alleging they smuggled tobacco products in and out
of the South American country without paying duties and taxes.

<HEADLINE> IRS Warns Charities, Churches  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Internal Revenue Service issued an
election-year warning Wednesday that churches, charities and many
other tax-exempt organizations should not engage in political
activities encouraging support for or opposition to any candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The organizations involved are exempt from federal income taxes
under section 501(c)(3) of the tax code.
</P>
<P>
   ''These organizations cannot endorse any candidates, make
donations to their campaigns, engage in fund raising, distribute
statements or become involved in any other activities that may be
beneficial or detrimental to any candidate,'' said the IRS
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The agency issued similar warnings prior to the 1992 and 1996
presidential elections; the warnings are not aimed at any
particular organization, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said tax-exempt organizations could lose that status
or be subjected to an excise tax on the political money spent even
if they had no partisan motivation.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a federal appeals court upheld an IRS decision
denying tax-exempt status to the New York City bar association
because it published ratings of candidates for elective judicial
offices in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Contributions made to organizations that lose their 501(c)(3)
status are not deductible by the donors on their income taxes.

<HEADLINE> Storied History for Camp David  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. president's Camp David retreat in
western Maryland is best known for the peace agreement reached
there between Egypt and Israel 22 years ago. Now, its rustic
setting offers a quiet venue for Israeli President Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, hosted by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   President Franklin D. Roosevelt first used the hideaway in the
Catoctin Mountains during World War II. Much modernized, the
Navy-run camp 90 miles from Washington has been used by every
president since then for rest, recreation and as an informal place
to meet world leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The place has been Camp David since the 1950s when President
Eisenhower found Roosevelt's name, ''Shangri-La,'' a little fancy,
and renamed it for his 5-year-old grandson, David Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt met there with Winston Churchill; Eisenhower with
Nikita Khrushchev; Richard Nixon with Leonid Brezhnev.
</P>
<P>
   The name gained international currency in September 1978 when
President Carter tirelessly brokered a cornerstone peace agreement
between Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has not visited the retreat as often as his
predecessors, but has used it for diplomatic purposes before. The
first official dinner held for Barak was on the Camp David grounds.

<HEADLINE> French Cinemas Defy Ban  </HEADLINE>
By MARILYN AUGUST
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- A violent, sexually explicit movie that opens with
a harrowing rape scene has outraged France's political
conservatives and provided a rallying point for defenders of
artistic expression.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, France's Council of State, responsible for
interpreting rules and regulations, declared the film pornographic
and said it could incite violence, exiling it to the country's few
X-rated theaters. The film's title -- which would not be publishable
in most newspapers -- is an obscene sexual command.
</P>
<P>
   Two mainstream distributors defied the ban by showing the movie
to adult audiences, risking large fines.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which was screened at the Cannes Film Festival in May,
passed almost unnoticed until a citizens' group with links to the
far right complained it was unsuitable for minors.
</P>
<P>
   France's film critics have panned the movie, with the respected
Le Monde daily newspaper calling it ''a sick film.'' The weekly Le
Nouvel Observateur said it ''throws sex in your face to sell blood
and gore.''
</P>
<P>
   The film is the story of two young women -- played by a former
prostitute and a pornography star -- who team up in a rampage of
mindless sex and violence. Directed by Virginie Despentes, the
movie purportedly is meant to reflect society's brutal treatment of
women.
</P>
<P>
   Movie distributors Marin Karmitz and Galeshka Moravioff told
French media they would reject the ban. Karmitz said by telephone
that he would not be muzzled by far right groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm continuing to show the movie because the council's
decision undermines freedom of expression and could have serious
consequences, not only for the French cinema, but for the arts in
general,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Theaters risk fines of up to $51,000 for showing the film.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has been front-page news for a week in France, where
artistic freedom often goes unchallenged, and nudity is commonplace
on television.
</P>
<P>
   Culture Minister Catherine Tasca told RTL radio on Wednesday
that she would introduce ''as soon as possible'' a proposal for a
new under 18-prohibited rating that would allow the film to remain
in general cinemas and not be X-rated. After learning of Tasca's
intentions, Karmitz said theaters would hold off showing the film
until the new rating takes effect.
</P>
<P>
   French director Catherine Breillat has accused the Council of
State of overstepping its role as protector of the constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now there exists a higher body that has given itself the right
to impose censure: it just took waving the specter of pornography
and the protection of moral values,'' she wrote in petition signed
by dozens of film personalities.

<HEADLINE> Scotland Yard Settles McLibel Case  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLINE RNE
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Scotland Yard agreed Wednesday to pay $15,000 to
two vegetarian activists who accused police of supplying McDonald's
Corp. with confidential information about them during a libel
trial.
</P>
<P>
   David Morris, 46, and Helen Steel, 34, nicknamed the McLibel
Two, each was awarded $7,500 plus legal costs after their case was
settled out of court without an admission of liability, Scotland
Yard said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We regret any distress to the claimants which may have been
caused by the alleged disclosure of their details,'' the police
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Morris and Steel sued police in 1998 after the McDonald's
security chief testified during their libel trial that he used
police department contacts to obtain personal information about
protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said that information included their home addresses.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel completely vindicated,'' he said. ''We didn't fight
this case for monetary reasons. ... It was more important to expose
the collaboration between big business and the police, and to force
the police to alert all police officers this is an illegal
practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Benfilun, spokeswoman for McDonald's Restaurants Ltd., the
British division of the Oak Brook, Ill.-based McDonald's Corp., had
no comment on the settlement, calling it ''a matter for the
police.''
</P>
<P>
   In December, Morris and Steel also won a a partial victory in
their David-and-Goliath struggle to overturn a 1997 court decision
that they libeled the fast-food restaurant operator.
</P>
<P>
   Three Court of Appeal judges ruled that Morris and Steel were
justified in claiming regular customers of the hamburger chain face
a heightened risk of heart disease. The judges also said it was
fair to say McDonald's subjected its employees to poor working
conditions and paid them badly.
</P>
<P>
   However, the judges agreed with the trial judge that Morris and
Steel had defamed McDonald's by claiming that its products were
poisonous and increased the risk of cancer and that the company
contributed to starvation and deforestation in developing countries
where it buys much of its beef.
</P>
<P>
   Judges reduced the amount of damages Morris and Steel were
ordered to pay by a third, from $92,700 to $61,300.
</P>
<P>
   The case, known widely as ''McLibel,'' lasted 314 days and was
the longest trial in English history.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said he and Steel plan to appeal the December findings to
the European Court of Human Rights.

<HEADLINE> Laudor committed to mental institution  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - Michael Laudor, whose battle against
schizophrenia was once a Hollywood success story, was committed to
a mental institution Wednesday, two years after killing his
pregnant fiancee.
</P>
<P>
   State Supreme Court Justice Daniel Angiolillo ruled that Laudor,
37, ''has a dangerous mental disorder'' and should be sent to a
secure treatment center for the next six months. The order can be
extended for a longer term when his case is reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   In May, over the impassioned objections of the victim's family,
Laudor was found not responsible for the killing of Caroline
Costello, 37. She was found knifed to death on June 17, 1998, in
the kitchen of an apartment she shared with Laudor in
Hastings-on-Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Three psychiatrists agreed that Laudor killed Costello because
he thought she was ''a nonhuman impostor'' conspiring to
hospitalize him for torture, experimentation and death. Prosecutors
were forced to concede that with the doctors' reports in evidence,
no jury would convict Laudor of murder.
</P>
<P>
   Laudor had graduated from - and even taught at - Yale Law School
despite his schizophrenia. He had sold book and movie rights to his
story and was considered a role model for victims who control
schizophrenia through medication.
</P>
<P>
   But after the death of his father in 1997, Laudor stopped taking
his medication, apparently believing it to be part of a conspiracy
against him. His condition worsened and his fiancee, his mother and
his doctor arranged a visit from a crisis intervention team. That
impending visit, according to one psychiatric report, precipitated
the killing because Laudor thought he would be tortured and
lobotomized.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, prosecutor Robert Prisco said reports from two
doctors at the Mid-Hudson Forensic Psychiatric Center in New
Hampton - where Laudor has spent the last two years - argued for
continued treatment. One said Laudor was ''dogged by symptoms''
even after being medicated. The other said Laudor ''continues to
receive messages through songs.''
</P>
<P>
   Laudor, unshaven and with his hands cuffed behind him, did not
speak. His attorney, Andrew Rubin, did not contest the commitment
order, but told the judge that Laudor had been nonviolent, and had
been taking his medication, since a few weeks after the killing.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs, which carry considerable side effects and can be
administered only gradually, were not yet at a therapeutic level
for Laudor, said Rubin, adding that his client's symptoms might
wane once that level is reached.
</P>
<P>
   Outside court, Laudor's brother Daniel said the commitment was
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all hope that care and medication will lead to whatever
improvements are possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules governing insanity pleas, if the state Office of
Mental Health and the court ever agree that Laudor is no longer a
danger to himself or others, he could eventually be released.

<HEADLINE> US To Aid Honduran Victims  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hurricane victims in Honduras will move from
temporary to storm-resistant housing with help from $4.1 million in
U.S. aid, leaders of the two governments said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The assistance was announced in a joint statement by Housing
Secretary Andrew Cuomo and Honduran President Carlos Roberto
Flores.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development said the money
will help as many as 6,000 Honduran families move out of the
temporary housing they have used since Hurricane Mitch swept
through Central America in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the department said the aid will be help provide
long-term planning for building new and reconstructed communities;
rebuild damaged infrastructure; provide financing for home repairs;
and provide training in building houses designed to withstand
powerful storms.
</P>
<P>
   ''The assistance we're providing can speed up efforts to rebuild
communities, rebuild housing and create a better future,'' Cuomo
said
</P>
<P>
   Flores, speaking via satellite from Honduras, expressed
gratitude ''for the prompt and significant cooperation that the
United States extended during our emergency and for the subsequent
efforts of assistance and rehabilitation.''

<HEADLINE> Judge dismisses discrimination charges by former state police head  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A state Superior Court judge Wednesday
dismissed charges by the ousted head of the New Jersey State Police
that the governor wanted him to resign in retaliation for published
remarks he made linking minorities with drug trafficking and
discriminated against him because she wanted to appoint a younger,
black man.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman pressed for Superintendent Carl Williams
to resign in February 1999 after The Star-Ledger of Newark
published an interview in which he made comments about police
practicing racial profiling, or stopping motorists based on their
race.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman told Peter Verniero, who was attorney general at the
time, to call Williams at his Mount Laurel home and ask for his
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Williams filed a host of charges several months after he
resigned. Only two remain - allegations of defamation against
Assemblyman Leroy Jones Jr. and of libel against The Star-Ledger.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Judith A. Yaskin on Wednesday dismissed
Williams' claims that he was retaliated against by the state and by
Whitman for his comments to the newspaper. The judge said, because
he resigned and was not fired, that did not constitute retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   She also dismissed charges that Whitman, Verniero and the state
discriminated against him, and that Whitman's spokesman, Peter
McDonough, defamed him.
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary Alito, the lawyer representing Whitman, McDonough and
the state, said that because Williams was a high-level political
appointee and he voluntarily resigned, his claim does not fall
under the protection of state or federal anti-discrimination laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of his claims that he was discriminated against because
he's white, because he's a man and because of his age were
dismissed,'' said Alito.
</P>
<P>
   The judge did give Williams 15 days to try to reassert a claim
that there was a conspiracy to defame him.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also dismissed Williams' claim that Verniero, as
attorney general, had a duty to advise him that he had a right to a
hearing and that he did not have to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Williams claimed that Verniero ''engaged in deceit or trickery
in order to get him to resign,'' said Wayne Positan, Verniero's
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The judge dismissed those claims and said that Williams, as head
of the state police, could not ''justifiably claim that he didn't
know what his rights were,'' Positan said.
</P>
<P>
   On June 2, Yaskin dismissed Williams' attempt to collect $21
million in a personal injury lawsuit
</P>
<P>
   In September 1999, Whitman appointed Carson Dunbar Jr., a
47-year-old FBI special agent, to head the state police. Dunbar is
black.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' lawyer, Clifford Van Syoc, did not return a message
from The Associated Press on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's spokeswoman Jayne O'Connor said the governor had no
comment on the judge's decision.

<HEADLINE> Sex Not a Factor in Heart Recovery  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHANIE NANO
<TEXT>
<P>
   Women are just as likely as men to survive heart attacks, even
though they typically are treated somewhat less aggressively, a
study found.
</P>
<P>
   Many studies in recent years have documented that men are more
likely than women to get state-of-the-art treatment for their heart
attacks. But those studies generally did not answer whether the
extra treatment makes a difference.
</P>
<P>
   The new research determined that men are slightly more likely to
get most -- though not all -- necessary drugs. But in the end this
does not seem to give men a significantly better chance of
surviving, at least for the first month after their heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Although the results are encouraging, the gender differences are
still a concern, said Dr. Leighton Chan of the University of
Washington School of Medicine, one of the researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wouldn't necessarily say the issue is a dead one,'' Chan
said. ''I think our study still supports the fact that early
identification of a heart attack in women is probably not done as
well as it is in men.''
</P>
<P>
   Heart attacks are the leading cause of death for both men and
women, although Chan noted, ''We think of the 55-year-old
overweight guy who has been eating cheeseburgers who clutches his
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Other research has shown that doctors may miss heart attacks in
women for a variety of reasons. For one thing, women are less
likely to suffer crushing chest pain.
</P>
<P>
   The latest study, published in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine, looked at 138,956 Medicare patients who had heart attacks
in 1994 or 1995. Unlike previous studies, this one screened out
patients for whom the treatments were not considered appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   The women studied were significantly older than the men, were
more likely to wait to seek treatment and also waited longer for an
electrocardiogram once they arrived at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Among other findings:
</P>
<P>
   --Women were 7 percent less likely than men to receive
clot-dissolving drugs within the first hour of treatment and 3
percent less likely to get the drugs during their hospital stay.
</P>
<P>
   --Women were 6 percent less likely to get aspirin within the
first day in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   --Women had fewer catheterizations to determine whether they
needed angioplasty or a heart bypass operation to clear blocked
arteries, and that disparity increased with age. Those in the
youngest group, ages 65 to 69, were 6 percent less likely to have
the procedure. That increased to 25 percent for the oldest group of
women, those 85 or older.
</P>
<P>
   --For two standard heart attack medicines, women received the
same or slightly better treatment than men. They were as likely as
men to be prescribed beta blocker drugs, which reduce the heart's
workload, and 5 percent more likely to get ACE inhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nanette K. Wenger of the Emory University School of Medicine
noted that previous studies have shown major differences in
treatment and outcome for men and women.
</P>
<P>
   ''I find this encouraging. It seems that physicians treating the
Medicare population across the country are getting the message,''
Wenger said.
</P>
<P>
   One surprise in the study was that women were 26 percent more
likely to have do-not-resuscitate orders stipulating that no
extraordinary measures be used to prolong their lives. Chan could
not explain this difference.

<HEADLINE> Six children thrown from pickup in crash; driver charged with DWI  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PERSIA, N.Y. (AP) - Six Buffalo children, ranging in age from
six to 12, were hurt in the crash of a pickup truck whose driver
was drunk, state police said.
</P>
<P>
   The children were thrown from the bed of the truck, which had a
cap, when the vehicle went off the shoulder of the road, hit a tree
and flipped in the Cattaraugus County Town of Persia, about 30
miles south of Buffalo Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the children, including the driver's 10-year-old son
and 12-year-old daughter, were listed in good condition Wednesday
at Children's Hospital in Buffalo. The others were treated at
Tri-County Hospital in Gowanda and released.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Bracero, 42, of Buffalo was arraigned in Persia Town Court
on charges of driving while intoxicated and endangering the welfare
of a child. Bracero, who also was ticketed for numerous traffic
violations, was being held in Cattaraugus County Jail in Little
Valley after failing to post $2,500 bail.
</P>
<P>
   State troopers said Bracero and the children were on their way
home from a picnic in the Zoar Valley state recreational area when
the crash occurred about 6:30 p.m. Several of the children's
parents were following in cars behind the pickup truck but it was
unclear whether they witnessed the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Bracero was scheduled to return to court July 11.

<HEADLINE> Crime news site files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - In a bid to stay alive until new investors are
found, the parent of online news provider APBNews.com filed for
bankruptcy Wednesday, one month after slashing back its operations
and firing most of its staff.
</P>
<P>
   APBOnline Inc., the parent company of the crime news site,
sought protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the
federal bankruptcy laws in New York, company spokesman Joe
Krakoviak said.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has $7 million in debt, has already gone
through $27 million in cash from investors. Krakoviak said
APBNews.com will need to raise another $15 million in order to get
its business to the breakeven point by early 2002.
</P>
<P>
   APBNews.com announced in early June that it had run out of money
and was firing all of its 140 employees. The site continued to
operate with a small staff of volunteers, and two weeks later the
company received enough new funding to hire back two dozen people
full time.
</P>
<P>
   The site has received numerous awards and citations since being
founded in late 1998. It has also attracted several luminaries from
the traditional journalism world, including Sydney Schanberg, who
won the 1976 Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   Other providers of online news and other content have also
stumbled in recent months as market valuations for Internet
companies have plummeted. Salon.com, a high-profile online
magazine, was among those laying off staff and cutting costs.

<HEADLINE> Lieberman announces bid for third term  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) - U.S. Sen. Joseph Lieberman on Wednesday
announced his plans to seek re-election to a third term, touting
his work to clean up the entertainment industry and promising to
make education reform his top priority in the next six years.
</P>
<P>
   In a ceremony outside the Stamford house where he grew up and
surrounded by his mother, wife, sister, other relatives and
supporters, Lieberman said he had worked hard to promote family
values, reduce crime, reform the welfare system and strengthen
Connecticut's economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat cited specifically his cosponsorship of the V-chip
law, which allows parents to control the television viewing of
their children, and charter schools legislation to expand
educational choices.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those are the responsibilities that the people of Connecticut
have entrusted in me. I have worked hard to uphold them, to realize
their common values and ideals, and I'm proud of the things we've
been able to accomplish together,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, 58, said if re-elected he would focus on federal
education reform, including giving local school systems more
flexibility in spending federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you educate poor kids better, they're going to find their
way up in America,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would also work to lower the cost of prescription
drugs, and to strengthen the long-term solvency of Medicare and
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, a former state senator and attorney general, stunned
Connecticut's political establishment in 1988 when he defeated
incumbent U.S. Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. by 10,000 votes. Six
years later, he won the biggest landslide victory ever in a
Connecticut race for a U.S. Senate seat, a margin of more than
350,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months Lieberman has been mentioned as a possible
running mate for Vice President Al Gore. Lieberman said Wednesday
he is not seeking the job, but would consider it if asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't expect to be asked. Obviously, if that ever happened,
I'd certainly think about it, but to me, it's a nonevent.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's national profile was raised substantially in
September 1998 when he delivered a scathing speech on the Senate
floor accusing President Clinton - an old friend - of immoral
behavior in the Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   Waterbury Mayor Philip Giordano, a Republican, last month
announced his challenge to Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Giordano on Wednesday accused Lieberman of paying too much
attention to lobbyists who contribute to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Senator Lieberman has gotten too global. He's more
interested in raising his national profile than he is in actually
representing the state of Connecticut,'' said Giordano, 37, now in
his third term as mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's spokesman, Dan Gerstein, called Giordano's remarks,
''silly political games.''

<HEADLINE> Safir discusses park attacks with elected women officials  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Elected women officials said Wednesday that
Police Commissioner Howard Safir has promised to revise the patrol
guide to specifically talk about police behavior at large scale
events.
</P>
<P>
   If officers fail to take complaints from victims and follow up
on reports of criminal activities, the penalties will be severe,
Safir reportedly said at a closed-door meeting about last month's
Central Park attacks. Several officers there have been accused of
ignoring pleas for help from women who were either stripped, groped
or robbed by a roving band of young men.
</P>
<P>
   However, after the meeting with 22 women from Congress, the
state Assembly and city government, Safir said the group ''agreed
to nothing, except to work together.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir said he has been looking at making changes to the patrol
guide - the police ''bible'' of conduct - for some time.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we're going to define more specifically the
responsibilities of police officers at certain events so they're
codified and less ambiguous,'' Safir said.
</P>
<P>
   The women asked for the meeting to discuss why some officers
ignored crime victims in the park on June 11, following the Puerto
Rican Day Parade. The female public officials were outnumbered at
the meeting, held at Police Headquarters, by more than 50 police
officials, many of them women officers.
</P>
<P>
   The politicians expressed their gratitude for Safir meeting with
them. They were not pleased, however, with the NYPD's decision
against suspending five officers and six commanders in connection
with the Central Park attacks.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Safir released the first phase of the NYPD's internal
investigation into police behavior at the park.
</P>
<P>
   Four commanders received letters of reprimand. Two commanders
received ''letters of instruction'' spelling out what went wrong
after the Puerto Rican Day parade and how not to repeat the
mistakes. Five officers and three civilian 911 dispatchers face
still unspecified discipline procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel that everyday that there is a lack of an appropriate
response from the police department is really an insult to every
resident here in our city,'' said Rep. Carolyn Maloney,
D-Manhattan. She wrote a letter last month to Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani asking for a meeting; the mayor asked Safir to conduct it.
</P>
<P>
   The group also said that 24 of the 59 victims have alleged that
the officers they approached for help ignored them. Safir has said
only six victims accused officers of ignoring them.
</P>
<P>
   Of the officers named in the internal investigation, two were
cited for ignoring three victims. Safir has said the investigation
is ongoing, and more officers could be disciplined.
</P>
<P>
   City Councilwoman Christine Quinn did acknowledge that the NYPD
is still talking with victims. Some are being brought back to the
park and asked if they can remember where they approached officers
for help. The department then tries to pinpoint which officers were
assigned to those locations.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some changes are in the works.
</P>
<P>
   The public officials who met with Safir said he promised to
equip all police officers at large events with radios in the
future. Only sergeants had them at the Puerto Rican Day Parade.
</P>
<P>
   The department will also put one supervisor in charge of big
events. The internal police report on the June 11th problems points
out that many of the park attacks occurred along Central Park
South, the border of two NYPD commands.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the public officials who met with Safir called the
meeting conciliatory, City Councilwoman Annette Robinson called the
gathering an ''opening salvo.''

<HEADLINE> Fertility Treatment May Carry Risk  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Inducing ovulation to treat infertility carries a
significant
risk of producing unwanted multiple births, even when doctors
carefully follow the standard guidelines, a study concludes.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Researchers who conducted the study say the only way of lowering
the chances of producing triplets or more is to give less
ovary-stimulating drugs, but this also significantly decreases the
chance of producing a baby.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers examined ovulation induction, which involves
giving women drugs called gonadotropins to induce the release of
eggs. This is the most common fertility treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Norbert Gleicher and others reviewed data from the treatment
of 1,494 women at the Center for Human Reproduction in Chicago. The
treatments resulted in 314 single babies, 88 twins, 22 triplets, 10
quadruplets, five quintuplets and two sextuplets.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors attempt to reduce the chances of so-called high-order
multiple gestation -- triplets or more -- by monitoring the ovaries'
egg production and checking blood hormone levels. However, these
methods are imperfect, and the researchers concluded that one
standard tool, ultrasound scans, is essentially worthless.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting back on gonadotropins reduced the chances of multiple
births, Gleicher said, but ''that would give you such a low
pregnancy rate that no patient would accept this treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers recommended that doctors instead rely
exclusively on in vitro fertilization. With that method, two
embryos typically are conceived outside the woman's body and then
implanted in her uterus.
</P>
<P>
   Gleicher said this costs two to three times more than ovulation
induction but is also two to three times more likely to result in a
pregnancy and eliminates the risk of triplets and quadruplets.
</P>
<P>
   In an accompanying editorial in Thursday's New England Journal
of Medicine, Drs. Siladitya Bhattacharya and Allan Templeton of the
University of Aberdeen in Scotland urged avoiding aggressive ovary
stimulation and instead recommended in vitro fertilization to
implant one or two embryos.

<HEADLINE> An analysis of NARAL's ad questioning Lazio on abortion  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   An analysis of the National Abortion and Reproductive
Rights
Action League's ad questioning Republican Senate candidate Rick
Lazio's position on abortion:
<TEXT>
<P>
   TITLE: ''One Question.''
</P>
<P>
   LENGTH: 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Democratic political consultant Hank Sheinkopf.
</P>
<P>
   AIRING: Cable markets, primarily Long Island and Westchester but
with some distribution in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   SCRIPT: (On-screen announcer) I have one question for Rick
Lazio. How would he vote in the United States Senate when it comes
to the Supreme Court and abortion?
</P>
<P>
   Like most New Yorkers, I believe it's a woman's right to decide.
</P>
<P>
   One Supreme Court decision could rob us of this choice.
</P>
<P>
   Now Rick Lazio is saying he can't promise New Yorkers he'd
oppose anti-choice judges.
</P>
<P>
   So how would Rick Lazio vote on Supreme Court nominations?
</P>
<P>
   It's a simple question. New Yorkers deserve an answer.
</P>
<P>
   IMAGES: The advertisement is narrated by a woman seated in a
living room.
</P>
<P>
   Her voice is heard throughout the ad, but her image is replaced
by the words ''How would Lazio vote?'' followed by footage of
Robert Bork's Supreme Court hearings and a headline about Lazio
from the New York Post that reads: ''Pro-choice GOP candidate is a
master of ambiguity.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Will Lazio Oppose Anti-Choice Judges?'' then appears on the
screen, followed by ''For More Information About Lazio's
Anti-Choice Voting Record, Call 1-877-NARALNY.''
</P>
<P>
   ANALYSIS: This ad is designed to appeal to suburban women who
are independent voters, age 35 to 45, who strongly favor abortion
rights. The narrator, Ross DeMarco, who is not identified in the
ad, is not a professional actress but a NARAL member who lives on
Long Island. NARAL director Kelli Conlon said she was chosen
because ''we wanted to have a face that represented'' the voters
they are trying to reach.
</P>
<P>
   Conlin said the ad includes a reference to Bork because he is
''the quintessential example'' of a Supreme Court nominee who
acknowledged opposing Roe v. Wade. ''We need to know if there's
another Bork nominated, our senator will vote against that,'' she
said. Bork was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Reagan
in 1987 but rejected by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The ad was paid for and created by NARAL, which has endorsed
Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said repeatedly that she would only back Supreme
Court nominees who support Roe v. Wade.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, campaigning upstate Wednesday, described himself as
pro-choice but reiterated his refusal to prejudge any candidate for
the high court. ''I just don't think there ought to be a litmus
test,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, he told the New York Post he would take court
nominees' abortion views into consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ''You want to have as much information as you possibly can about
a judge's philosophical proclivities and where they're headed and
how they got there ... I want to know how they are reasoning on the
issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has voted against Medicaid funding for abortion, against
allowing privately-funded abortions at overseas military hospitals
except in cases of rape or incest, and opposes the late-term
abortions called ''partial-birth'' by critics.

<HEADLINE> State recommends ways to prevent and investigate computer crime  </HEADLINE>
By J.J. THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The state needs to update its computer
crime laws, coordinate law enforcement and educate the public to
keep up with increasingly sophisticated computer criminals,
according to a report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The State Commission of Investigation and the Attorney General's
Office recommended ways New Jersey can prevent and investigate
computer crimes such as hacking, personal identity theft and child
sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   A good first step, according to the report, would be to update
the state's computer crime law, which was enacted in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The report noted that the law was so outdated that it failed to
recognize advances in technology such as the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been 16 years since it was updated and it hasn't been
used in years,'' said Robert Clark, commission deputy director.
</P>
<P>
   Police and prosecutors also need to designate someone in every
department or office who is responsible for dealing with computer
crimes, Clark said. They should decide if they need to dedicate
special investigative units to computer crime, which would then
coordinate efforts with the Attorney General's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators need to work closely with the federal government
and private sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of this is so that the state can be on the cutting edge
when it comes to (investigating) computer criminals,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   The Attorney General's Office continues to work on training and
coordinating enforcement through its Internet Working Group, said
spokesman Paul Loriquet. It's now up to the Legislature to act on
recommended changes to computer crime laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel we made a good presentation (in the report),'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other recommendations included maintaining the prohibition on
Internet gambling and establishing toll-free hot lines for computer
crime complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The commission heard three days of expert testimony on computer
crime in 1999. It topped off an investigation by the commission and
the Attorney General's Office.
</P>
<P>
   The 150-page report details a wide range of issues such as
Internet fraud, gambling and hate crimes. Pornography and
pedophiles who stalk the Internet were an area of major concern.
</P>
<P>
   During the hearings, experts testified that online child
pornography and pedophiles pose a much larger risk than most
parents and teachers realize.
</P>
<P>
   Pedophiles meet children through Internet chat rooms or e-mail,
and pornography rings use it to transmit porn.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a mother of three small children, I was particularly
shocked at the extent to which the Internet has become a means for
the abuse and exploitation of children,'' SCI Commissioner Audriann
Kernan stated in a press release.
</P>
<P>
   To combat the problem at home, the report suggests parents
monitor what their children are looking at on the Internet,
preferably by keeping the computer in a busy room such as the
kitchen or den. Installing blocking or filtering software to
prevent children from certain sites also is recommended.
</P>
<P>
   In school it's important for teachers and librarians to
supervise students using the Internet and provide tips for avoiding
sexual predators online, the report said.

<HEADLINE> US Concerned With Iraqi Activity  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP)-- The State Department expressed concern
Wednesday about actions at Iraqi sites that it said are known to be
capable producing weapons of mass destruction and long range
ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern, the department said, is Iraq's
''long-established practice'' of acquiring materials that have
civilian uses but also could be used to make powerful weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The department commented in a written response to press
questions about a New York Times story last Saturday that said Iraq
has restarted its missile program and has conducted flight tests of
a short-range ballistic missile.
</P>
<P>
   The tests -- eight since as early as May 1999, including one last
week -- have involved Al Sambaed, a liquid-fueled ballistic missile
that could carry conventional explosives or the chemical and
biological weapons that Iraq is still suspected of hiding,
according to Clinton administration and military officials cited by
the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department response said that in the absence of United
Nations inspectors on the ground in Iraq, uncertainties about the
significance of these activities will persist.
</P>
<P>
   ''As time passes our concerns will increase,'' it said.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Off 129; Dow Down 77  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks fell steeply Wednesday after
Computer Associates became the latest company to warn that profits
won't meet expectations. An analyst's cautious outlook on the
semiconductor industry added to high-tech's woes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The damage is fairly well concentrated in the technology
stocks,'' said William Meehan, chief market analyst for Cantor
Fitzgerald. ''It's feeding on itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index fell 128.83 to close at 3,863.10, its
worst performance since May 23.
</P>
<P>
   Blue-chip technology components weren't immune from the selloff.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 77.07 to 10,483.60, with IBM
contributing most to the decline.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was down 23.31 from Monday's revised close, finishing at
1,446.23.
</P>
<P>
   Computer Associates plummeted $21.531 to $29.594, a 42 percent
drop. Shortly after midnight Tuesday, the company surprised Wall
Street analysts by warning that its fiscal first-quarter results
would badly miss expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The warning raised fears that other technology companies will
also issue disappointing results when the earnings reporting season
goes into full gear later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, BMC Software said Wednesday morning that fiscal
first-quarter earnings will be 18 to 21 cents a share, compared
with analysts' consensus prediction of 46 cents. Its shares fell
$14.188 to $21.313 on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Even the largest technology companies fell prey to investors'
worries about earnings. IBM fell $5.875 to $104.
</P>
<P>
   The semiconductor sector tumbled after Salomon Smith Barney
analyst Jonathan Joseph said a decline in sector shipments and
prices was evidence of a growth slowdown over the next six to nine
months. Intel, a bellwether for the group, fell $5.25 to $131.625
although Joseph didn't single it out.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Oracle fell $7.813 to $72.375 after J.P. Morgan analyst
William Epifanio downgraded the stock to ''market performer'' from
''buy.'' Epifanio cited concerns over Oracle's plan for management
succession after president and chief operating officer Ray Lane
stepped down last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''We regard Ray Lane's departure as extremely negative news,''
Epifanio said, noting that Lane provided balance to CEO Larry
Ellison, who is known for his brash style.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-dominated Nasdaq has gained substantial strength
in the past weeks, rising more than 20 percent above the lows it
touched in late May. But investors remain nervous, Meehan said, and
appear unwilling to help the Nasdaq break out of a relatively tight
trading range.
</P>
<P>
   ''Perhaps we won't be able to break this range until we see the
actual second-quarter numbers,'' he said, noting that most
companies are expected to show strong profit growth.
</P>
<P>
   Oil stocks were also lower in the first trading session since
Saudi Arabia signaled it may soon begin producing an additional
half-million barrels a day. The Saudis said in a statement Monday
they will provide higher production within a few days if crude
prices don't quickly head lower toward their preferred price of
about $25 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon Mobil fell $2.609 to $76.938.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks improved on the news that a key gauge of future
economic activity fell in May, suggesting that the Federal
Reserve's efforts to put the brakes on economic expansion are
working.
</P>
<P>
   The Index of Leading Economic Indicators declined by 0.1
percent, primarily because of a pullback in manufacturing and a
decline in stock prices. The report raised some hopes that the Fed
will leave rates unchanged at its next meeting on Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup rose 81.25 cents to $63.25.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a slender margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume came to 1.22
billion shares. The stock market was closed on Tuesday for the
Independence Day holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 5.79 to 518.25.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.2 percent.
Germany's Xetra DAX index rose 0.3 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was
down 0.5 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 0.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Ex-military academy employee pleads guilty to arranging tryst with 'boy' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A longtime employee of a prestigious
Pennsylvania military academy pleaded guilty Wednesday to crossing
state lines to have sex with a minor.
</P>
<P>
   Computer specialist James P. Hopkinson Jr., 50, had worked at
Valley Forge Military Academy and College in Wayne, Pa., for 25
years before resigning last year.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkinson lived on the campus of the all-male school, which has
about 800 students ranging in age from 12 to 21, but school
officials have said he had no improper contact with any of them.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkinson was arrested April 21, 1999, at a northern New Jersey
mall, where he had gone to meet a 14-year-old boy he'd met on the
Internet a week earlier. The teen was actually an undercover FBI
agent who met Hopkinson in a chat room where adults have been known
to seek juveniles for sex.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Donna A. Krappa said Hopkinson pleaded
guilty before U.S. District Court Judge Garrett E. Brown Jr. to a
charge of traveling interstate to engage in a sexual act with a
minor.
</P>
<P>
   He faces up to 15 years in prison and a $250,000 fine when
sentenced on Sept. 25, but under federal guidelines the sentence
would be less severe.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkinson also pleaded guilty to a charge filed in Pennsylvania
of possession of child pornography. Krappa said authorities
searched Hopkinson's home on the day he traveled to New Jersey and
found magazines that contained child pornography.
</P>
<P>
   On that charge, he faces up to five years in prison and a
$250,000 fine, Krappa said.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkinson agreed to forfeit his home computer, which was taken
during the search.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkinson had been sentenced to home detention with electronic
monitoring. On Dec. 31, 1999, he had been given permission to do
some errands, Krappa said. His probation officer was notified that
day that his electronic bracelet had been deactivated. Hopkinson
was found at Jefferson Hospital in Philadelphia after an apparent
suicide attempt, Krappa said.
</P>
<P>
   He was released from the hospital on Jan. 13 and ordered to
undergo psychological testing. Hopkinson was then held at the
Monmouth County Jail, Krappa said.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkinson resigned from the school about a week before his
arrest because he was unhappy with changes in his job duties within
the school's information systems department, said school
spokeswoman Heather Swech.
</P>
<P>
   The school, which was founded in 1928, is the alma mater of such
people as Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf and author J.D. Salinger.

<HEADLINE> Police appeal for help in identifying body found in Atlantic County </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUENA VISTA TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - State Police are asking for
help identifying a corpse found Wednesday along a roadside in rural
Atlantic County.
</P>
<P>
   The body of a Hispanic man in his 30s was spotted by a passing
motorist on Jackson Road at about 10 a.m., State Police spokesman
John Hagerty said.
</P>
<P>
   The body, which was clad in a long-sleeved button-down shirt,
beige pants and a ''distinctive'' cowboy-insignia engraved brown
leather belt, was located about 20 yards from the road in a wooded
area. State Police believe it had been pulled from a car sometime
Tuesday night and dragged into underbrush.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy was performed Wednesday, but results weren't released
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ''The condition of the body indicated it was freshly dumped. And
there's no indication the individual died there,'' Hagerty said.
</P>
<P>
   The body is about 5-feet 5 inches tall and weighs 140 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''We figure the sooner we get out with a little bit of
information, the sooner we'll get something back,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> EU: Wider Probe of US Spys  </HEADLINE>
By CONSTANT BRAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Parliament voted Wednesday
to widen a probe into an alleged U.S. spy network that many
assembly members say Washington is using to snoop on the businesses
of its European allies.
</P>
<P>
   A special committee will immediately begin investigating the
so-called Echelon spy system, which is believed capable of
intercepting billions of phone calls, e-mails and faxes per hour
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence officials have never publicly confirmed the
existence of such a system. They have denied eavesdropping on
ordinary American and European citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The European Parliament committee will be mandated with trying
''to verify the existence'' of the system and investigating whether
the spy system violates European Union privacy laws.
</P>
<P>
   The special committee will have eight months to investigate and
will also look into countermeasures and possible sanctions against
nations participating in Echelon, said Graham Watson, chair of the
citizens rights committee of the parliament, which represents the
European Union's 15 members.
</P>
<P>
   The committee will seek cooperation from the U.S. Congress,
which had hearings of its own in April, Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   A report by the parliament in February alleged the United States
uses Echelon to monitor European businesses and has passed on
information to help U.S. companies gain competitive advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Former CIA director James Woolsey has acknowledged the United
States has secretly collected information on European companies,
but said it only did so when companies were suspected of violating
U.N. sanctions or offering bribes to gain business.
</P>
<P>
   The new investigation comes after months of debate in the
626-member European Parliament following the February report, which
described a spy network comprised of surveillance stations around
the globe.
</P>
<P>
   The stations -- located on U.S. territory and also Britain,
Canada, Australia and New Zealand -- listen in and intercept
''billions of messages per hour,'' the report said. It has caused
outrage among many Europeans and led to a flurry of national
parliamentary inquiries by several EU countries.
</P>
<P>
   French authorities, which have been the most critical of
Echelon, have started a full-scale investigation of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the European Parliament led by the German Green Party
had sought stronger powers for the new investigation, but their
motion was voted down by the full assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The motion would have given investigators the power to order
witnesses to testify, which the Greens had hoped to use to compel
several U.S. officials, including CIA Director George Tenet and Lt.
Gen. Michael V. Hayden, head of the National Security Agency, to
testify before the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Both have denied reports the United States was involved in
spying on Europeans and Americans as part of a satellite
surveillance network in testimony to the U.S. Congressional House
Intelligence Committee.

<HEADLINE> Autopsy: Wild Animal Killed Athlete  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUEBEC (AP) -- A Canadian biathlon star killed while training in
a forest died from head and neck injuries inflicted by a wild
animal, most likely a black bear, a coroner said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Coroner Cam Turmel said 90 percent of Mary Beth Miller's
injuries were to her head, with the rest on her neck. He said
Miller, 24, defended herself and tried to escape, but the animal
dragged her for ''a certain distance.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The injuries were fatal,'' Turmel told a news conference.
''She had no chance of survival.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, of Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories, failed to
return from a training run Sunday in a heavily wooded area at a
military base northwest of Quebec City, and her body was found that
night.
</P>
<P>
   Bear tracks were spotted near the body.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was a member of Biathlon Canada, the national biathlon
association, and won a bronze medal at the North American biathlon
championship last year in Camrose, Alberta.
</P>
<P>
   She had arrived at the Valcartier military base last week for a
summer of training at the Myriam Bedard Biathlon Center, located on
the base.
</P>
<P>
   Her body was located by military searchers about a half-mile
from a main road.
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife officials placed several cages around the area to try
to catch the bear, and the Canadian base closed trails until
further notice. Base officials earlier warned the athletes about
black bears after one chased two cyclists in June.

	   NEW YORK (AP) - The Duchess of York has decided not to leave her
home in England for Switzerland after all.
</P>
<P>
   The former Sarah Ferguson had told Biography magazine in its
July issue that she planned to move when her daughter Beatrice
started her term in a Swiss school. Prince Andrew, her former
husband, was to remain in England with the couple's other daughter.
</P>
<P>
   But after the magazine went to print, the Duchess decided to
stay with her daughters in Sunninghill Park, the family's home
outside London, because ''a number of issues surrounding the school
remain unresolved,'' said her spokesman, Gerry Casanova, of
Rubenstein Associates.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Leaving behind swords and buttons, Italian navy cadets fish for love </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Fresh off the tall ship Amerigo Vespucci and on
his first visit to New York, Italian navy cadet Giacomo Persi-Paoli
had no trouble finding his way around. Within a day, he and his
buddies had dates lined up with five American women.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have girlfriends back home. But we will be faithful,''
promised Persi-Paoli, 21, who kicked off his 15-hour shore leave on
Wednesday by shopping for athletic shoes and CDs.
</P>
<P>
   At 7 p.m., he and four other sailors were going dancing with
women they met Tuesday night at a Union Square restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Conclusion: ''New Yorkers are much friendlier than Italians,''
said Persi-Paoli, a native of Livorno, Italy, where the country's
elite naval academy is based.
</P>
<P>
   His girlfriend had one thing going for her: Her beau was due
back in his hammock by 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Each in their first year of training, the 21-year-olds stepped
out in Manhattan in dark blue, hand-sewn jackets and perfectly
tailored snow white pants. The sailors wandered around the city
without the ceremonial gold-and-pearl swords they usually carry on
their sides. ''They told us it was too dangerous to wear them in
New York,'' said cadet Gianpaolo Misseritti.
</P>
<P>
   Also left behind were spare buttons for their uniform jackets,
which have a ring of gold buttons around each sleeve - with one
missing.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a tradition, from the time when a member of the Italian
royal family, a cadet, fell in love and ripped a gold button off
his sleeve to leave to the woman,'' said Alessandro Crocetta.
</P>
<P>
   He was among 120 cadets from the 331-foot frigate Amerigo
Vespucci, discovering the land named after the Florentine navigator
whose name the vessel bears.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until now, our only steps off the ship were to carry off the
garbage,'' Crocetta said as he saluted the Italian flag and left
Pier 86 on the West Side.
</P>
<P>
   His group wanted to see a part of the city few New Yorkers ever
heard of: ''Brocolino,'' said Carlo Corso. That's Brooklyn, as old
Italian immigrants called it.
</P>
<P>
   But first, Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is just like the movies! There's life, there's always
movement!'' said Corso, his Italian singing with excitement as he
walked a seedy stretch of 42nd Street, eyes meeting the
skyscrapers. ''Even the ugly areas are fascinating. And look at
these cars - they're bigger, more elegant than the Italian ones.
This is the New World!''
</P>
<P>
   And there was another bit of Americana to bite into: ''Ot
dohgs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (Hot dogs, of course.)
</P>
<P>
   They had no interest in pizza. After all, the baker aboard their
ship made ''midnight pizza'' - gourmet pies made from scratch every
night and delivered to those on duty until 4 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   On the pier, U.S. Navy staffers were passing out a ''hangout
guide,'' including entertainment tips and a map of the New York
subway system.
</P>
<P>
   It was an item two ordinary sailors from the Vespucci failed to
pick up.
</P>
<P>
   Standing confused in the middle of bustling Times Square, they
caught sight of their fellow mariners and asked for help getting to
Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   Sailor Giacomo Magrone was in New York for the first time, too,
and was getting a tattoo at a Bleecker Street address a friend
recommended.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want anything tribal, or ugly. Maybe just a dragon.''

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The deaths of two inmates under strikingly
similar circumstances could prompt changes in guard training and
how prisoners are restrained throughout New York state prisons,
especially for mentally ill inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Independent reports on the two deaths, before state Corrections
Commissioner Glenn Goord since last month, each recommend revisions
of prison procedures.
</P>
<P>
   From Dutchess County came a grand jury report on the death of
inmate Hardat Persaud on Nov. 16, 1999, at Fishkill state prison in
Beacon. From Franklin County came a relatively unusual district
attorney's report, from local prosecutor Andrew Schrader, on the
death of inmate William Dean on Christmas Day 1999 at Franklin
state prison in Malone.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the inmates had mental problems. Persaud was a
schizophrenic and Dean was experiencing a psychotic episode at the
time of his death.
</P>
<P>
   Both men died after being subdued by corrections officers - as
many as eight for the 300-pound Dean and up to five in Persuad's
case. Grand juries in each case determined guards were not
criminally responsible for the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Both men died of ''positional asphyxiation'' suffered when the
inmates were forced to lie on their stomachs while at least one
guard applied pressure - apparently enough to fatally inhibit
breathing - to the prisoners' backs.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a grand jury in Dutchess County and District Attorney
Schrader in northern New York concluded the inmates' deaths
suggested weaknesses in guards' training and on-the-beat
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you study Mr. Dean's death you see there were
inadequacies in the way the situation was handled,'' said Schrader,
who had repeatedly viewed a surveillance camera video tape of the
incident. ''It really boils down to - I thought it boiled down to -
a lack of training.''
</P>
<P>
   Schrader said guards who subdued Dean at the medium-security
Franklin state prison were not experienced in ''cell extraction''
because, except for the special housing unit of the prison where he
was confined at the time, inmates sleep in dormitory-style
settings.
</P>
<P>
   Dean, who had landed in the special housing unit after punching
a guard earlier on Christmas Day, was restrained by guards while a
nurse gave him injections of anti-psychotic drugs. Guards were
under the mistaken impression that the drugs would calm Dean down,
Schrader said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, guards pinned Dean chest-first to the floor
from behind and waited for the drugs to take effect. When Dean did
''calm down,'' Schrader said, it probably meant he had passed out
from lack of oxygen and was on his way to smothering.
</P>
<P>
   In both instances, guards only realized there were serious
problems after inmates had become unconscious, according to
descriptions of their deaths in the Malone Telegram and the
Poughkeepsie Journal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was clear to me from looking at it (the video) that these
fellows were acting in good faith,'' Schrader said of Dean's death.
''There were some jerky little moves by guards, but nothing that
was ultimately serious ... They weren't trying to hurt this
fellow.''
</P>
<P>
   Schrader said he recommended that Goord review how guards are
trained about restraint techniques. There were state Department of
Correctional Services memos about the potential dangers of
handcuffing someone behind their backs and leaving them on their
stomachs, but the information available to guards ''didn't go far
enough,'' the district attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know about you, but I never knew or thought that if
you take a big person and put them on their belly and keep them
there, you can kill them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor also told Goord that guards may need more
training to recognize severe psychological problems in inmates and
how to safely handle them.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutchess County grand jury concluded that guards needed
better training in safe-restraint techniques and when to call for
medical help.
</P>
<P>
   State prison spokesman James Flateau said the dangers of
''positional asphyxiation'' are taught at the prison guards'
academy in Albany, but that Goord is ''absolutely'' open to
improvements in restraint procedures and to other recommendations
before him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Glenn hasn't made any hard-and-fast decision on that,''
Flateau said. ''Basically, we have to balance the medical
procedures with the security ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Gangi, head of the prison watchdog state Correctional
Association, said the reports suggest that Dean and Persaud ''died
unnecessarily'' and that there is a ''serious burden weighing on
the state to take steps to avoid these kinds of incidents in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Gangi said his group frequently talks to guards who freely
acknowledge their own ''inadequacies'' in dealing with mentally ill
inmates. Other prisoners fear them just as much as prison staffers,
if not more, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't particularly blame the corrections officers,'' Gangi
said. ''I don't particularly blame the system. They are being put
into an almost impossible situation where they are being asked to
handle people with serious mental problems and people who act out
violently ... They have this excessive and unreasonable burden of
handling, confining and treating thousands of mentally ill
people.''

<HEADLINE> Curfew Sought on U.S. Soldiers  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL SMITH
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKINAWA CITY, Japan (AP) -- Police in Okinawa urged the U.S.
military on Wednesday to reimpose a late-night curfew on soldiers
after three Marines were arrested, including one who allegedly
entered the home of a 14-year-old girl and fondled her as she
slept.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests and complaints by Okinawa officials and police come
two weeks before leaders of the Group of Eight industrial nations
are to meet in Okinawa -- a summit that is expected to draw protests
by opponents of the U.S. military bases on the island.
</P>
<P>
   Police Superintendent Keishi Shinjo said the arrests of the
three Marines, who all appeared to be drunk at the time, renewed
public calls for the U.S. military to reimpose a curfew barring
American soldiers from nightclubs in the city's entertainment
district late at night.
</P>
<P>
   ''The timing of these arrests so close to the G-8 summit has
left many people shocked. These incidents all happened around
midnight,'' Shinjo said. ''The military must do a better job ... to
keep control over military personnel during these hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Shinjo said one Marine was arrested Monday after being found
fondling a teen-age girl in her home. Two other Marines were
arrested last week after a scuffle with a taxi driver.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, the U.S. military lifted a 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. curfew
imposed on its soldiers in Okinawa City's entertainment district
after three servicemen were convicted of raping a 12-year-old girl
in 1995 on the island 1,000 miles southwest of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Earl B. Hailston, commander of Marine forces in
Okinawa, said he met Wednesday with Hideo Ishikawa, the deputy
governor of Okinawa prefecture, and the Okinawa City mayor,
Masakazu Nakasone, to hear their complaints about the three
Marines.
</P>
<P>
   Hailston issued a statement apologizing to Okinawans and
promising to do everything he can to make Marines abide by Japanese
law when they are off their military bases.
</P>
<P>
   ''These Marines are my sons and daughters. That is why it hurts
me deeply when any of my Marines appear to fall short of the
standard I have set and demand,'' he said. ''It hurts me, as it
hurts you, my neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Okinawa police spokesmen Jun Yogi said the prefecture's police
asked Hailston on Wednesday to bar service members from leaving
their bases after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   A Marines spokesman, Capt. J.M. Plenzler, denied that the corps
had received such a request. Plenzler said the Marines once again
asked local police for permission to have uniformed, unarmed
Marines patrol the entertainment district of Okinawa City at night
to watch for misbehavior by soldiers. Police have refused similar
offers.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, a 48-member Okinawa Prefectural assembly
unanimously adopted a resolution urging the Japanese and the U.S.
governments to prevent assaults by American soldiers on Japanese
citizens, said assembly spokesman Tadashi Higa.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a 19-year-old Marine was arrested on suspicion of
entering a first-floor apartment in Okinawa City late at night,
lying down beside a female junior high school student while she
slept and fondling her, Shinjo said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The girl's mother discovered the Marine and ran next door to a
neighbor's house. The neighbor called police, who arrested the
Marine,'' Shinjo said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, two Marines -- one age 19 and one age 23 -- were
arrested for allegedly helping another Marine escape when he got
into a confrontation with a taxi driver on Okinawa. Police the
Marine who fled had scuffled with the taxi driver.
</P>
<P>
   Under a mutual security treaty between Japan and the United
States, about 47,000 U.S. military service people are stationed in
Japan, nearly two-thirds of them in Okinawa.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Farmers Fret Over Economy  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- White farmers warned Wednesday of
economic collapse if Zimbabwe does not take urgent action to end
the seizures of white farms and restore order.
</P>
<P>
   Rural violence has already destroyed a fifth of the Zimbabwe's
tobacco crop, on which it relies for export earnings, said Tim
Henwood, head of the Commercial Farmers Union. Militants have also
disrupted normal farming operations, slaughtered cattle and scared
off foreign investors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that if the militants are not stopped, the entire sector
could breakdown, which analysts said could cost tens of thousands
of jobs and trigger a financial crisis as farmers default on loans
owed to banks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Farmers are unable to plan ahead and are not investing in
their farms. The situation is simply no longer tenable,'' said
Henwood, whose union represents about 4,000 white farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last five months, militants have occupied more than
1,600 white-owned farms, and threats against white farmers continue
unabated, the union said. Violence has claimed the lives of 31
people, including five white farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The occupations began after President Robert Mugabe lost a
constitutional referendum in February that would have empowered him
to seize white-owned farms for the resettlement of landless blacks
without paying compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Militant supporters in the countryside, many of whom fought
under Mugabe's command in Zimbabwe's war of independence in 1980,
took matters into their own hands, seizing land they say was
unlawfully taken by white settlers from its original black
inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe calls the wave of seizures ''a minor trespass''
protesting unfair ownership of land by whites and ordered police
not to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   Independent economist John Robertson said the farmers were
correct in warning the lawlessness and seizures threaten to plunge
the economy deeper into crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks could force farmers to default on the some $160
million that they owe banks, and wipe out jobs not only in
agriculture but in industries that depend on agricultural products,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a very serious risk of civil unrest from the ordinary
employee who has lost his job and cannot feed his family. It's not
that food won't be available, he won't have the money to buy it,''
Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture accounts for 18 percent of Zimbabwe's gross domestic
product, and commercial farms such as those owned by white farmers
earn about two-fifths of the nation's hard currency, according to
official figures.
</P>
<P>
   Hard currency shortages have already caused acute gasoline and
power shortages, Henwood said, and ''the prognosis ... is worsening
by the day.''

<HEADLINE> EU: Wider Probe of U.S. Spies  </HEADLINE>
By CONSTANT BRAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Parliament voted Wednesday
to widen a probe into an alleged U.S. spy network that many
assembly members say Washington is using to snoop on the businesses
of its European allies.
</P>
<P>
   A special committee will immediately begin investigating the
so-called Echelon spy system, which is believed capable of
intercepting billions of phone calls, e-mails and faxes per hour
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence officials have never publicly confirmed the
existence of such a system. They have denied eavesdropping on
ordinary American and European citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The European Parliament committee will be mandated with trying
''to verify the existence'' of the system and investigating whether
the spy system violates European Union privacy laws.
</P>
<P>
   The special committee will have eight months to investigate and
will also look into countermeasures and possible sanctions against
nations participating in Echelon, said Graham Watson, chair of the
citizens rights committee of the parliament, which represents the
European Union's 15 members.
</P>
<P>
   The committee will seek cooperation from the U.S. Congress,
which had hearings of its own in April, Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   A report by the parliament in February alleged the United States
uses Echelon to monitor European businesses and has passed on
information to help U.S. companies gain competitive advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Former CIA director James Woolsey has acknowledged the United
States has secretly collected information on European companies,
but said it only did so when companies were suspected of violating
U.N. sanctions or offering bribes to gain business.
</P>
<P>
   The new investigation comes after months of debate in the
626-member European Parliament following the February report, which
described a spy network comprised of surveillance stations around
the globe.
</P>
<P>
   The stations -- located on U.S. territory and also Britain,
Canada, Australia and New Zealand -- listen in and intercept
''billions of messages per hour,'' the report said. It has caused
outrage among many Europeans and led to a flurry of national
parliamentary inquiries by several EU countries.
</P>
<P>
   French authorities, which have been the most critical of
Echelon, have started a full-scale investigation of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the European Parliament led by the German Green Party
had sought stronger powers for the new investigation, but their
motion was voted down by the full assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The motion would have given investigators the power to order
witnesses to testify, which the Greens had hoped to use to compel
several U.S. officials, including CIA Director George Tenet and Lt.
Gen. Michael V. Hayden, head of the National Security Agency, to
testify before the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Both have denied reports the United States was involved in
spying on Europeans and Americans as part of a satellite
surveillance network in testimony to the U.S. Congressional House
Intelligence Committee.

<HEADLINE> Charter plane crash investigation yields few answers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) - There are indications that at least one of the
engines on a doomed charter plane may have been operating just
before it crashed in the Pocono Mountains in May, federal crash
investigators reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The crash killed all 19 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the engines were functioning at the time of impact was
an immediate focus of the investigation by National Transportation
Safety Board officials. A statement from the agency Wednesday said
a careful study of the engines revealed the right engine propeller
may have been turning, but noted that whether the engine actually
had power has not been confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Flight times for the plane and fuel burn rates are also being
studied to determine if the plane may have run out of gas.
</P>
<P>
   Officials believe they have a general outline of what happened
just before the Executive Airlines twin-engine turboprop crashed in
the rain nine miles south of the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton
International Airport on May 21. The plane was returning passengers
from the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre area who had been on a casino junket
to Atlantic City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots declared an emergency soon after missing their first
approach of an airport runway, according to investigators. Just
before the second approach, the pilots said they had lost both
engines.
</P>
<P>
   Air traffic controllers began providing information about the
terrain and elevation after radar indicated the plane was flying at
about 2,000 feet above sea level, considerably lower than the
minimum safe altitude, officials said. The crash site was 1,765
feet above sea level.

<HEADLINE> Restrictions on Sante Kimes after allegation of escape plot  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Jail officials have put restrictions on the
movements of Sante Kimes, sentenced last week to life in prison for
murder, because of another inmate's allegation that she was
plotting an escape.
</P>
<P>
   Corrections spokesman Tom Antenen said jail officials will not
let Kimes leave Rikers Island before she goes to prison next week.
If her lawyers want to see her, they have to come to Rikers.
</P>
<P>
   Antenen said the allegation that Kimes was in escape mode
reached jail officials Monday. He said a lawyer reported that his
client, another female inmate, said Kimes had tried to enlist her
in an attempt to break out.
</P>
<P>
   Antenen, who said the inmate asked her lawyer to pass the
unconfirmed information along to authorities, did not identify her
or her attorney.
</P>
<P>
   There was no physical evidence of an escape plan, Antenen said,
but ''whenever we hear the 'E' word we take precautions.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Kimes escaped after an arrest years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Kimes and her son, Kenneth Kimes, 25, were each sentenced on
June 27 to more than 120 years in prison for murdering wealthy

<HEADLINE> Putin Makes Trip for Chechnya Talks  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- President Vladimir Putin blamed poor
military discipline for heavy Russian losses in suicide truck
bombings in Chechnya, rebuking top officials during a surprise
visit Wednesday to the volatile region.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's appearance in neighboring North Ossetia came amid tight
security and high tensions in and around Chechnya, prompted by the
Sunday night bombings.
</P>
<P>
   The five truck bombings killed at least 33 soldiers and wounded
scores of people and posed the biggest setback in months to Russian
forces trying to re-establish control over the rebel republic.
</P>
<P>
   ''Large losses could have been avoided. For that, strict
discipline, professionalism and responsibility is needed,'' Putin
told a meeting at military headquarters in the city of Mozdok,
according to Russian news agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting included Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Interior
Minister Vladimir Rushailo, top commanders, and the Chechen head of
the pro-Moscow administration in the republic, Akhmad Kadyrov, the
Kremlin press service said.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev and other Russian officials had also blamed the suicide
bombings on a lack of discipline among troops, including heavy
drinking and bribe-taking. The truck drivers made it past military
checkpoints and into cities the Russians claim to control.
</P>
<P>
   While in Mozdok after leaving a summit in Tajikistan, Putin
ordered government bodies in Chechnya to obey the defense
minister's commands, Interfax said. He told interior minister
Rushailo to speed up formation of police units consisting of loyal
Chechens, saying the local population can better determine who the
rebels are.
</P>
<P>
   Putin owes some of his popularity among Russians to his firm
handling of the Chechnya war and hawkish dismissal of international
criticism of the offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bombings, he said, the rebels have been reduced to
tactics of ''sneaking out of corners ... An end will be put to
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian forces have been saying for weeks that organized
resistance has been wiped out -- yet the rebels have inflicted
steady casualties with ambushes and hit-and-run attacks in areas
the Russians claim to control.
</P>
<P>
   ''At present the Russian military are confident that the war is
coming to an end, but we believe that it's the end of war for them,
whereas our war has just begun,'' rebel commander Khamzat Gelayev
told The Associated Press on Wednesday from a base in Chechnya's
southern mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have always lacked food and weapons, but had we had enough
of each we would have been in Moscow by now,'' Gelayev claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Federal troops took control of the northern two-thirds of
Chechnya early in the 10-month-old war, but have been chasing rebel
bands in the rugged terrain in the south for months.
</P>
<P>
   The coffins of members of a police detachment from Chelyabinsk,
in the Urals Mountains, were returned home Wednesday by plane, and
local officials declared a day of mourning. Twenty-two of those
killed in the bombings came from the Chelyabinsk region.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops rolled into Chechnya in September to restore
federal control over the rebellious region. Russian troops were
driven out by independence fighters in a 1994-96 war, but went back
in after Islamic militants based in Chechnya raided villages in
Dagestan, and after about 300 people died in apartment bombings the
government blames on Chechens.
</P>
<P>
   Putin praised the overall campaign Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Few could have imagined that after the invasions of Dagestan,
the actions of the federal organs would be so decisive, and the
results so fundamental,'' he said, according to Interfax.

<HEADLINE> Galarraga Leads Braves All-Stars  </HEADLINE>
By TOM SALADINO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Andres Galarraga not only came back from a bout
with cancer, on Wednesday he made another huge stride, being
selected to the National League All-Star team.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta first baseman was among four Braves players added to
the squad, giving the Braves five players for Tuesday night's game
at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel very good, very excited,'' said Galarraga before
Wednesday night's game against the Montreal Expos.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to say thank you to all the fans that gave me great
support last year and this year,'' he said. ''I thank God for
giving me my health and all the beautiful and happy things that
have happened to me this year. It's a gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with the Big Cat, who missed all of the 1999 season while
undergoing treatment for cancer, outfielder Andruw Jones and
pitchers Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine were picked to join third
baseman Chipper Jones, who was voted in by the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what else you can say about him,'' said Glavine.
''Everything he's done has been phenomenal. All we had hoped for
was to see him out on the field again, let alone on an All-Star
team. It's been a great story.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Cox of the Braves, the NL manager for the All-Star game,
</P>
<P>
   said there was never a doubt in picking Galarraga.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was second in the voting and he's got the numbers. He's
been our MVP the first half,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga was hitting .299 with 19 homers and 60 RBIs prior to
Wednesday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   ''It means a lot to me and my family to come back and play
baseball. Now to make the All-Star team is really something,''
Galarraga said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire of the Cardinals, elected to start at first, had
threatened not to play unless teammate and outfielder Jim Edmonds
was picked as a reserve.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire said Wednesday he was joking. Cox said he never heard
about McGwire's comments.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't read newspapers,'' Cox said. ''Edmonds had been on our
list for the last 3&AMP;frac12; weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be the fifth All-Star appearance for Galarraga, the
first for Andruw Jones, the eighth for Maddux, the seventh for
Glavine and the fourth for Chipper Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just happy and my parents are happy,'' Andruw Jones said.
''It's my first All-Star game and I can't wait. It's something
special. You don't have to clean out your locker or pack a
suitcase. It's good to have it at home. That's doesn't happen very
often.''
</P>
<P>
   It's especially meaningful for Glavine, who has been with the
Braves' organization since the 1984 amateur draft.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's something I've wanted to be a part of since spring
training,'' he said, ''and is particularly special to me since I've
spent my whole career here.''

<HEADLINE> BC-NJ--Teachers-Pay, 1st Ld-Writethru,580  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) - The nation's largest teachers' union took a step
closer Wednesday to ending its century-old resistance to paying
teachers for performance, instead of just seniority. But the union
refused to embrace a proposal to base pay on how well students
perform on tests.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the National Education Association, in crafting
changes to its bargaining policy, insisted the new ''bonus'' pay
approach should not replace pay based on seniority, nor subject a
teacher to the whims of a principal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will continue to oppose merit pay based upon subjective
evaluations,'' said NEA President Bob Chase, who has been both
praised and vilified for stressing a ''new unionism'' that urges
collaboration with management on improving schools.
</P>
<P>
   During hours of emotional debate, some teachers bitterly opposed
the changes, arguing it will be the beginning of the end for a
pay-for-seniority policy that dates back to the 1920s, the earliest
years of the public education system. The opponents argued bonuses
based on student performance or a boss' judgment are divisive and
unfair to teachers with the most-troubled students.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who will want to teach the poor students? The students who
don't speak English as well?'' said Barbara Kerr, a member of the
California Teachers Association. ''This makes us vulnerable to the
growing attacks by districts, school boards and our enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   Edithe Fulton, vice president of the New Jersey Education
Association, who has taught elementary school for 34 years, said
the policy undermines attempts by union locals to bargain with
school boards.
</P>
<P>
   ''School boards can look across the table and say look what your
national organization has done,'' she complained.
</P>
<P>
   The new NEA policy was adopted on voice vote by the 10,000
delegates attending the conference.
</P>
<P>
   While it does not endorse replacing seniority scales with any
system of bonus pay, the resolution says the national organization
will give technical assistance to a local that has ''bonus'' plans
imposed on them by legislatures or school boards. A local would not
be kept from imposing such a plan on itself as part of bargaining
with school boards.
</P>
<P>
   Union members, who supported the policy change, said the shift
toward some form of bonus pay structure was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ''We could no longer engage in the culture of refusal,'' said
Andrea Giunta, an elementary school teacher who leads the Denver
affiliate of the NEA. ''Teachers are terribly underpaid. People are
seeking any way teacher compensation can be improved.''
</P>
<P>
   She said it is better to have teachers involved in crafting the
plans instead of fighting them.
</P>
<P>
   Teacher cash incentives have grown in popularity around the
country as business leaders and politicians frequently call for
higher standards in primary education. Various incentive plans have
been proposed in New York City and in California, giving teachers
higher salaries or bonuses for performance.
</P>
<P>
   Some shift toward performance incentives has been proposed by
both Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore as they
complete for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The American Federation of Teachers, a smaller union with 1
million members that was meeting in Philadelphia, has not made a
decision on the issue. AFT president Sandra Feldman said her group
is studying the pay-for-performance issue.

<HEADLINE> Yanks' Posada Makes All-Star Team  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Yankees manager Joe Torre knew he'd be taking
Jorge Posada to Atlanta with him for the All-Star game. He just
made Posada wait to find out the news.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm more than excited,'' the catcher said Wednesday after
finding out he was going to his first All-Star game. ''I couldn't
sleep last night to tell you the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Posada's anxiousness was heightened when Torre told him Tuesday
that he needed to meet with his starting catcher before batting
practice Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Torre told Posada, Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera
that they would join starter Bernie Williams for next Tuesday's
game in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've known in my mind for a long time that he is an
All-Star,'' said Torre, who will manage the AL team. ''It just
depended on how many other catchers were having All-Star years.''
</P>
<P>
   Posada (.314, 14 HRs, 49 RBIs entering Wednesday) beat out
Baltimore's Charles Johnson (.313, 19, 44) for the spot backing up
Texas' Ivan Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as the numbers are close, I don't think anybody has a
problem with it,'' Torre said. ''If my guy is hitting .260 and the
other guy is at .330, then I'm not going to take my guy. As long as
my guy's numbers are in the ballpark, every manager would do the
same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson held no ill will toward Torre for picking his own
player.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the way it should be,'' Johnson said. ''If he feels
that Posada is having a good year, he should bring his own guy to
the game. Good for him.''
</P>
<P>
   After getting the news, Posada immediately called his parents in
Puerto Rico and his wife. He had been planning to return to Puerto
Rico for the three-day break but instead will bring his parents to
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every day my parents have been calling, 'Did they tell you
already? Did they tell you already?''' Posada said. ''They wanted
to come if I made it.''
</P>
<P>
   The All-Star selection was especially rewarding for Posada, who
struggled last year (.245, 12, 57) and was under pressure this
season as Joe Girardi's replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm proud of him because of what he went through,'' said
Jeter, Posada's closest friend on the team. ''People doubted him.
He had the opportunity this year and made the most of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Girardi, now with the Chicago Cubs, also was pleased for his
former understudy.
</P>
<P>
   ''He deserves it,'' Girardi said. ''That's the reason I'm not
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter, picked for his third All-Star team, said he still gets
excited about making the team.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every player wants to play in the All-Star game,'' Jeter said.
''If they say they don't, they're lying to you.''

<HEADLINE> Sports Agent Indicted in Michigan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Sports agent William ''Tank'' Black has
been indicted on money laundering and drug charges by a federal
grand jury in Detroit, a Columbia television station has reported.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested Wednesday morning and will remain in jail until
a bond hearing next week, prosecutors told WIS-TV.
</P>
<P>
   The 34-count indictment says Black took more than $1 million
from drug dealers and funneled it into a car title loan business.
</P>
<P>
   That title business was part of a $300 million pyramid scheme,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Black and his associate Linda Wilson also have been charged with
conspiracy and perjury charges.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Black and Wilson helped a man flee who was
wanted for drug dealing by the federal government. The television
station reports the two flew the man from Columbia to Jamaica on a
private jet and gave him thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   At a February bail hearing in state court in Florida,
prosecutors there claimed Black went to Jamaica with two drug
dealers from Detroit in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Black and Wilson could face up to life in prison and $4 million
in fines if convicted of all counts.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment is similar to one handed down in Florida. There,
Black is accused of defrauding several NFL players. The Securities
and Exchange Commission also has sued Black, accusing him of
scamming players for more than $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Black had been out on a $1 million bond from that case, which is
scheduled to go to trial in January.

<HEADLINE> Hornets' Mason Pleads Innocent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Charlotte Hornets forward Anthony Mason
pleaded innocent Wednesday to charges of inciting a riot,
assaulting a police officer and public drunkenness.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Craig Mitchell, entered the plea in New Orleans city
court on behalf of Mason, who was released from jail Tuesday. A
court date has been set for Nov. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Mason, 33, was arrested Monday night in the French Quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Two officers noticed two groups of men arguing over women on
Bourbon Street and when the officers tried to break up the groups,
the 6-foot-8, 270-pound Mason hit one of the officers and began
rallying the crowd, police spokesman Joseph Narcisse said.
</P>
<P>
   The officer who had been hit tried to subdue Mason with pepper
spray, but with little effect, Narcisse said. Other officers
arrived and some in the crowd threw bottles and shouted racial
slurs at police.
</P>
<P>
   Mason fled and the crowd followed him, while police went to the
8th District station. Mason later was arrested and taken to a
hospital for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   No officers were seriously hurt in the melee, Narcisse said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is indeed unfortunate that such a minor incident has
garnered such attention,'' Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   Don Cronson, Mason's agent, says that Mason did not hit a police
officer and that the charges are unwarranted.
</P>
<P>
   Mason was arrested on two counts of misdemeanor assault in
February after a scuffle outside a bar in New York. The charges
later were dropped when prosecutors said they did not have enough
evidence to convict him.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Mason could be sentenced to up to $500 and six
months in jail on each charge, city police said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The Braves signed right-hander Scott Kamieniecki
on Wednesday in an effort to bolster their injury-riddled pitching
staff.
</P>
<P>
   Kamieniecki, designated for assignment by the Cleveland Indians
on June 23, refused the assignment and became a free agent. He will
be available to pitch Thursday, when the Braves will have to make a
roster move.
</P>
<P>
   Kamieniecki was 1-3 with a 5.67 ERA in 26 games with the
Indians. He gave up 42 hits and 22 earned runs in 33 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   After pitching for the the New York Yankees and Baltimore
Orioles, Kamieniecki was signed as a free agent by Cleveland in
December. He has a 51-58 career record.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta has seven pitchers on the disabled list, including John
Smoltz, Odalis Perez, David Cortes and Rudy Seanez, all out for the
season; and Greg McMichael, Luis Rivera and Kevin McGlinchy.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera is on a rehabilitation assignment in the minors and
McGlinchy will begin rehab Thursday at Triple-A Richmond.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Recently retired guard B.J. Armstrong rejoined
the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday as a special assistant to team
general manager Jerry Krause.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, an 11-year NBA veteran, retired at the end of last
season. He will replace Clarence Gaines Jr., who has left the team
to pursue other career opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Krause said Armstrong would handle a ''wide variety of scouting
assignments'' and would be involved in ''all aspects'' of scouting
and player development.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a player, I developed great respect for the way the Bulls
organization operates,'' Armstrong said. ''I have a great
opportunity to learn the other end of professional basketball from
the best in the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, 33, started and ended his career in Chicago in two
stints with the team that included the Bulls' first three
championship seasons in 1991-1993. He played in 27 games last
season, averaging 7.4 points and 2.9 assists.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- While three White Sox were picked for
the All-Star game, Frank Thomas and Keith Foulke were left off the
American League roster.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am a little disappointed, because I deserved to be there,''
Thomas said. ''This is probably the best first half I've ever
had.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, an All-Star from 1993-97, entered Wednesday's game
against Kansas City with a .340 average, 25 homers and 72 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Foulke began the night with 16 saves.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've done too much in this league on a consistent basis to be
looked over,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Picked from Chicago, which has the best record in baseball, were
outfielder Magglio Ordonez, second baseman Ray Durham and pitcher
James Baldwin.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel for Frank because of the half he's had,'' White Sox
manager Jerry Manuel said. ''He's basically been carrying a young
team. He should have been a guy to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez and Durham are making their second All-Star appearances.
Baldwin is making his first.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nice to be selected,'' Baldwin said. ''A lot of our guys
deserved to go. They've got to take a select few. I will definitely
dedicate this to my teammates. Without them, if it weren't for
them, I definitely wouldn't be in the situation I'm in.''
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin is 11-3 with a 3.79 ERA, while began the night 10th in
the AL in batting at .339 average. He has 19 home runs with 72
RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Durham is hitting .284 with 13 home runs and 47 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a special ballclub,'' Thomas said. ''We're playing
great. Nothing can take anything away from this season. I'll just
deal with it.''

<HEADLINE> Bids for Rare Baseball Card Start  </HEADLINE>
By JOE MANDAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The baseball card equivalent of the Hope
Diamond is being auctioned on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The online auction house eBay began accepting bids Wednesday on
a near-mint condition card depicting Hall of Fame shortstop Honus
Wagner of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Bidding on the card, issued in
1909 by the American Tobacco Company, will continue through July
15.
</P>
<P>
   Two bids were received Wednesday night, the highest for
$550,000, said Kristen Sewell, a spokeswoman for eBay.
</P>
<P>
   Like other collectibles, the card's price is driven by its
rarity and condition -- it is the finest specimen of about 50 Wagner
cards known to exist from the 1909 set. But this card's value is
bolstered by an almost harmonic convergence of legend, celebrity
ownership and circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   ''This card represents the hobby's entree into the kind of
prices that fine art gets. There aren't too many other cards that
have the kind of pedigree this card has,'' said T.S. O'Connell,
managing editor of Sports Collectors Digest.
</P>
<P>
   Legend has it that Wagner ordered American Tobacco to pull the
card from circulation because he didn't want his likeness used to
sell tobacco, for fear it would influence children.
</P>
<P>
   That legend has been challenged, with some pointing to a 1948
Leaf bubble gum card that shows Wagner, by then a coach for the
Pirates, stuffing a wad of chewing tobacco in his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, the legend is true, says Robert Lifson,
president of Robert Edward Auctions of Watchung, N.J., which is
offering the card through eBay. He said he has seen newspaper
articles dating to 1912 that say Wagner did not want the cards
released.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the king of all baseball cards, really a legendary
collecting icon,'' Lifson said. ''This legend is not something
that's just come up. It was the (pre-eminent) baseball card legend
30 years ago, it was the baseball card legend 50 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in 1930, the Wagner card was appraised at $50 by the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, while other cards in
the rare 523-player set were valued at nickels or dimes, Lifson
said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell says Wagner's family rejects claims he pulled the card
after the tobacco company refused to pay him more money for his
likeness.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess if it was my grandfather, I'd dispute it, too,''
O'Connell said, adding he doesn't think money drove Wagner's
decision either.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even into the 1950s and 1960s, players didn't get much more
than a couple hundred bucks and a toaster,'' for letting baseball
card companies use their likeness, O'Connell said.
</P>
<P>
   Lifson said a 1912 newspaper article says Wagner and other
players got $10 each for letting the tobacco company put their
picture on its cards.
</P>
<P>
   That year's series of cards, known to collectors at the T206
set, remains the most collected set of baseball cards ever, Lifson
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Wagner card made history in 1991, when hockey superstar
Wayne Gretzky and Bruce McNall, then owner of the National Hockey
League's Los Angeles Kings, bought it for $461,000.
</P>
<P>
   The card was later sold to Wal-Mart, which raffled it off in a
national promotion. The winner, Patricia Gibbs, a Florida postal
clerk, immediately sold the card so she could afford to pay the
taxes she owed for winning it.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs consigned the card to Christie's of New York City, which
sold the card for $640,500 to renowned collector Michael Gidwitz,
who has owned it since.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell and Lifson said publicity about the card's
high-profile ownership will likely drive up the price.
</P>
<P>
   Bids above $500,000 must be in increments of $50,000. Bidders
must register in advance and wire $100,000 into an escrow account
to be qualified.

<HEADLINE> Five Braves on NL All-Star Team  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Pedro Martinez is dominating the All-Star game,
and he won't even be pitching it.
</P>
<P>
   On a day baseball announced five Atlanta Braves would be at the
game -- one-sixth of the National League roster -- Martinez was left
off the American League team Wednesday, apparently at the request
of the Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, the MVP of last year's game at Fenway Park after
striking out five in the opening two innings, is on the disabled
list with a strained muscle on his left side but is ready to be
activated after the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   He has said he was ready to pitch in Tuesday's All-Star game at
Atlanta's Turner Field, but he was omitted from the AL roster after
Red Sox manager Jimy Williams spoke with Joe Torre of the Yankees,
the manager of the AL team.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way this has shaken out is this is the right way to do
things,'' Williams said cryptically.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez is not on the AL's 31-man roster, but he will be
introduced as if he were an All-Star and will sit on the AL bench
during the game.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore's Cal Ripken, elected for what would be his 17th
straight start and 18th appearance, will try to play third base
despite a sore back, which has him on the disabled list. Torre said
a decision will be made this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's Manny Ramirez, elected by fans to start in the
outfield, is on the disabled list with a strained hamstring and
will miss the game.
</P>
<P>
   Under baseball's rules, you can be on the disabled list and
appear in the All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   Andres Galarraga, who missed all of 1999 while undergoing
treatment for cancer, heads the list of Braves ready to shine
before the hometown fans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to say thank you to all the fans that gave me great
support last year and this year,'' the Big Cat said. ''I thank God
for giving me my health and all the beautiful and happy things that
have happened to me this year. It's a gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Andruw Jones and pitchers Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine
also were selected by Atlanta's Bobby Cox, the NL manager, and join
Chipper Jones, elected to start at third.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Mets and St. Louis Cardinals have three players
each on the NL team. Mets second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo and
left-hander Al Leiter were picked to join starting catcher Mike
Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Mark McGwire of the Cardinals, elected to start at first
base, were right-hander Darryl Kile and outfielder Jim Edmonds.
McGwire had threatened not to play unless Edmonds was picked for
next Tuesday's game, the first at Atlanta since 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ''It amazes me,'' said McGwire, who leads the major leagues with
30 homers. ''Every word I say, the media writes it down. One time,
would you guys please put, 'in humor?' I'm very happy for him, he
deserves it. He's the big reason why we're in the position we are
today.''
</P>
<P>
   With Martinez out, Toronto's David Wells is the leading
contender to start for the AL team.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it happens fine. If not, it's no big deal,'' Wells said.
''I'm just going to go out there and take my turn. I'm sure this
will mean more to me when I'm retired and an old guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees and Indians have four players each on the AL team
and the Chicago White Sox, who have the best record in baseball,
have three along with Boston and Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Jorge Posada, shortstop Derek Jeter and reliever Mariano
Rivera were selected from the Yankees, joining Bernie Williams,
elected to start in the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no one player who was most difficult to leave out,''
Torre said. ''Charles Johnson, Frank Thomas, Tony Batista all got a
lot of consideration. You can go up and down the league. Joe Randa
is having a hell of a year. First base was probably the toughest
position. There are so many good numbers there. Jim Thome was
second in the voting (at first base) but his numbers just didn't
add up.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who has a .340 average with 25 homers and 72 RBIs, was
disappointed he wasn't picked.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've done too much in this league on a consistent basis to be
looked over,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Chuck Finley and third baseman Travis Fryman were
picked from the Indians, joining Ramirez and Roberto Alomar, the
starting second baseman.
</P>
<P>
   Also left off the AL team was White Sox reliever Keith Foulke.
Omitted from the NL team were Florida second baseman Luis Castillo,
Cincinnati reliever Danny Graves and Arizona outfielder Steve
Finley.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo was bypassed in favor of Montreal's Jose Vidro.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was shocked,'' Vidro said. ''I just didn't know what to
expect because there are so many second basemen having great
seasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Filling out the NL pitching staff were Kevin Brown (Los
Angeles), Ryan Dempster (Florida), Trevor Hoffman (San Diego),
Randy Johnson (Arizona), Shane Reynolds (Houston), Bob Wickman
(Milwaukee).
</P>
<P>
   The AL staff includes James Baldwin (Chicago), Tim Hudson
(Oakland), Jason Isringhausen (Oakland), Todd Jones (Detroit),
Derek Lowe (Boston), Aaron Sele (Seattle).

<HEADLINE> Germans Protest Khatami Visit  </HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Accusing Iran of human rights violations, German
lawmakers presented a petition Wednesday urging their government to
cancel next week's visit by Iranian President Mohammed Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   Eike Hovermann, a lawmaker for the governing Social Democrats
who was among the appeal's 175 signers, urged Germans to join
Iranian dissidents in protesting the visit. The invitation sent the
wrong signal because it ''stabilizes the ruling system'' in Iran,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some 300 members of state parliaments also signed the petition,
with support from both the governing center-left parties as well as
the opposition, Hovermann told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami, the first Iranian head of state to visit Germany since
the 1979 Islamic revolution, is to meet Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder, other officials and German business leaders during a
three-day visit starting Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder's spokesman rejected the petition. ''Our aim is for
the visit to strengthen reform forces in Iran,'' Uwe-Karsten Heye
told reporters. ''The visit is supposed to be a starting point for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ludger Volmer, the Foreign Ministry's No. 2 official, stressed
that German officials would talk to Khatami ''very intensively
about human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Khatami, a moderate cleric elected in 1997, has sought to revive
contacts with western Europe. Relations were frozen after a German
court in 1997 ruled that the 1992 shooting death of four Iranian
dissidents in Berlin had been ordered at the highest level in
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   But signers of the petition, who account for about a quarter of
parliament's lower house, charged he was a ''puppet'' of a regime
that suppresses political opponents and uses torture in its jails.
</P>
<P>
   The petition cited repeated condemnation of Iran's Islamic
rulers by the United Nations for reported mass executions, torture
and stonings.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami already visited Italy and France last year, and German
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer visited him in Tehran in March to
discuss a trip by Khatami to Germany.

<HEADLINE> Astros Release Reliever  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Veteran reliever Mike Maddux was released
unconditionally by the Houston Astros on Wednesday after an
injury-plagued season in which he went 2-2 with a 6.26 ERA in 21
games.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Wade Miller was recalled from Triple-A New Orleans
to replace Maddux.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux missed 29 games with a strained groin from May 21 to June
22. In three games since, he allowed five runs on seven hits and
three walks over just 4 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The brother of Atlanta Braves ace Greg Maddux signed a minor
league contract with the Astros last January and won a spot on the
roster in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was 4-5 with a 3.67 ERA and 81 strikeouts in 105 1-3
innings in New Orleans. He made his major league debut last season,
when he pitched in five games with an 0-1 record and 9.58 ERA in
September.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros announced their intention to put Miller into the
starting rotation and send Octavio Dotel, 1-5 with a 5.77 ERA, at
least temporarily to the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Miller is expected to make his first start Saturday against the
Kansas City Royals.

<HEADLINE> Inmate restrained with stun gun before death  </HEADLINE>
sywvitnews12fons
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) - A Connecticut inmate who died in a
maximum-security Virginia prison was probably going into insulin
shock when he was restrained for a behavior problem, the prisoner's
family said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence James Frazier, 50, lapsed into a coma just hours after
he was restrained with a stun gun at Wallens Ridge State Prison in
Big Stone Gap, Va. He died on Tuesday of apparent heart failure,
correction officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier was the second Connecticut inmate to die this year at
Wallens Ridge, where nearly 500 state prisoners have been
transferred because of overcrowding.
</P>
<P>
   ''My brother was murdered,'' Thomas Frazier said in a news
conference Wednesday. He said his brother was a diabetic who
suffered from high blood pressure and often complained of not
getting his medication since his transfer to Wallens Ridge in
December.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Correction spokesman Scott Semple said he could
not comment on Frazier's medical history, but inmates with serious
medical conditions are not transferred and Frazier met the
criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers critical of the state's decision to send inmates to
Wallens Ridge say prisoners and their families have complained of
inadequate medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy has been conducted, but correction officials said
results are still pending.
</P>
<P>
   Correction officials were investigating whether the use of force
was appropriate. The agency said it was important to keep in mind
that Frazier, who was serving a 30-60 year sentence for multiple
counts of sexual assault, had 103 disciplinary reports. Frazier was
convicted of repeatedly raping a woman during a robbery in her
Westport home in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier, formerly of Bridgeport, had been taken to the prison's
medical unit on June 29 for a health problem unspecified by
correction officials. When he was cleared by a doctor to return to
his cell, he became unruly and was restrained in a medical cell
with an electronic controlling device, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier was found unresponsive later that day and taken to a
hospital. He remained on life support until he died early Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   The state has come under fire for transferring inmates to
Wallens Ridge. The state Commission on Human Rights and
Opportunities is investigating allegations that the overwhelmingly
white prison staff has hurled racial insults at Connecticut
inmates, beat them and denied access to lawyers and religious
services.
</P>
<P>
   In April, David Tracy, a 20-year-old inmate from Bridgeport,
hanged himself in his cell at Wallens Ridge. A month earlier, three
Connecticut inmates were shot with rubber bullets by guards trying
to break up a scuffle.

<HEADLINE> Juror Deliberations Drag On  </HEADLINE>
By SUZANNE GAMBOA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO (AP) - Jurors ended another day of deliberations
without a verdict Wednesday in the trial of Allen Blackthorne, a
millionaire accused of plotting the grisly death of his ex-wife.
</P>
<P>
   Following a holiday break, jurors returned to consider whether
Blackthorne hired golfing buddy Daniel Rocha to arrange the murder
of Sheila Bellush.
</P>
<P>
   The panel had deliberated part of Thursday and on Friday and
Monday before pausing for the Fourth of July. They deliberated
about 10 hours on Wednesday before quitting for the evening. They
were to resume at 9 a.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony lasted about three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Bellush was killed on Nov. 7, 1997, about two months after
moving with her second husband, Jamie Bellush, and six children to
Sarasota, Fla. She had been beaten and shot and her throat
slashed.The quadruplets from Bellush's second marriage were
discovered unharmed in the house, two of them crawling in their
mother's blood. Jamie Bellush and the children now live in Sussex
County, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Blackthorne, 45, is charged with interstate conspiracy to commit
murder-for-hire and with interstate domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday afternoon, jurors had sent more than a dozen
notes to U.S. District Judge Edward Prado, some dealing with juror
business such as adjournment times and others relating to questions
about the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Requests for a transcript of testimony were rejected and jurors
were told to rely on their memory. Also refused was a request for
evidence that was referred to in the trial but was not part of the
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, jurors wanted to know the rules concerning what
evidence lawyers must provide opposing counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Does the defense have to give the prosecution all the evidence
they have?'' the jurors asked.
</P>
<P>
   Prado responded that the issue was a court matter.
</P>
<P>
   ''You are to consider only the evidence before you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors allege that Blackthorne asked Rocha to find a hit
man to bludgeon Bellush. Rocha testified he contacted his friend,
Sammy Gonzales, who hired his cousin, Jose Luis Del Toro, the
alleged gunman.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gonzales and Rocha are serving prison terms in Florida for
solicitation of murder.
</P>
<P>
   Del Toro, 23, is scheduled for trial next month in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   With deliberations dragging on, the third floor of the federal
courthouse has become a waiting room for the trial regulars,
family, friends and witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   A group of regulars sat in a line with family members outside
the third floor courtroom that at times has had overflow crowds.
Several said they have decided what the verdict should be, but they
declined to share their opinion on the record.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel that this case here is an unusual case,'' said Sandy
Gruenewaldt, a retired civil service worker, ''and it's common
knowledge who's guilty and who's not.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys in the case have agreed not to talk to media before a
verdict is returned.

<HEADLINE> Dick Vitale Relates Choking Episode  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- He couldn't ''call a TO, baby!'' but
Dick Vitale was rescued by a ''prime-time player'' when the college
basketball TV analyst choked on a piece of fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Vitale was back in his usual front-row box seat at Tropicana
Field on Wednesday, two nights after needing medical assistance
while taking in a game at the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ''I choked on a piece of melon and it gets lodged in the
windpipe and it won't go down,'' Vitale, a Devil Rays season ticket
holder, recounted.
</P>
<P>
   ''And now I start getting panicky. I'm drinking water and it's
still not going down. I finally stand up, and fortunately in the
room was a guy -- he's big and strong and he's a member of the St.
Petersburg Fire and Rescue squad.
</P>
<P>
   ''He came running over, grabbed (me) in the Heimlich, and the
first two times it won't come out.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now I'm really scared, and my wife said my face was changing
colors and I was panicking because I couldn't breathe. It was the
first time in my life I felt totally helpless. Finally, the third
time he bent me over and he really used all his strength and it
popped out.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh my God. I was shaking. It was scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Vitale said he plans to send the paramedic, John King, a cash
gift and some basketball books.

<HEADLINE> Insurance Head Named in Calif.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A Sacramento law professor will serve
as acting state insurance commissioner to replace Chuck
Quackenbush, who resigned under threat of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Clark Kelso, 40, a professor at the University of the Pacific's
McGeorge School of Law, will become acting commissioner Monday and
serve until Democratic Gov. Gray Davis fills the post.
</P>
<P>
   Kelso said Wednesday his principal task is to restore public
confidence in the Insurance Department.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush, a Republican, resigned as commissioner last week.
Lawmakers are investigating his creation and use of funds financed
by his department's settlements with insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush was elected to a second four-year term in 1998.
Davis' appointee, if confirmed by the Legislature, would hold the
job until voters elect a commissioner in fall 2002.

<HEADLINE> Central Asian Gov'ts Issue Statement  </HEADLINE>
By LIDA ISAMOVA
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) -- The presidents of Russia, China and
three Central Asian countries pledged Wednesday to fight terrorism,
drug trafficking and separatism -- and showed a common defensiveness
about their human rights' records.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese
President Jiang Zemin and the other leaders expressed concerns
about Islamic separatist movements in the mountain areas of Central
Asia and agreed to set up a joint anti-terrorist center in Bishkek,
the capital of Kyrgyzstan.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first meeting between Putin and Jiang since Putin was
elected president March 26. The two reiterated opposition to the
U.S. plan to deploy a limited national missile defense system, and
they confirmed support for Moscow's military campaign in Chechnya
and Beijing's push for reunification with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The joint statement by the five presidents also said the
signatories opposed ''intervention into the internal affairs of
other states, including under the pretext of 'humanitarian
intervention' and 'human rights protection.'''
</P>
<P>
   The statements were apparent references to the U.S. campaign in
Kosovo last year, which Russia and China strongly opposed, and
Western criticism of the countries' human rights records.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the summit also highlighted Russia's and China's
efforts to limit U.S. influence in Central Asia, an area controlled
by Russia since the middle of the last century but with historic
trade links to China.
</P>
<P>
   The summit group is known as the Shanghai Five for the site of
its first meeting in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Past meetings helped resolve a decades-old border dispute
between the former Soviet Union and China. Only the Tajik section
of the former 4,200-mile border remains contested, said Mikhail
Titarenko, head of the Institute of Far East Studies in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Kazak President Nursultan Nazarbayev on Wednesday called the
border, formerly bristling with weapons, ''a zone of trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Affirming Russia's role, Putin said Wednesday that Russia should
establish a permanent military base in Tajikistan, where Russian
troops are already stationed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know for certain, and Tajikistan agrees, that without the
presence of Russian troops, we will lose what we have succeeded in
achieving, including the securing of peace for the population of
Tajikistan,'' Putin was quoted as saying by the Interfax news
agency during a separate meeting with Russian military officials.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops patrol Tajikistan's border with Afghanistan
against frequent incursions by intruders, including smugglers
ferrying drugs to Central Asia, Russia and western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The Tajik government fought a five-year civil war with Islamic
rebels, ending with a 1997 peace deal. Russia maintains its
soldiers are needed to keep this peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''Russia's departure would mean economic and social collapse in
these countries,'' Titarenko said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's strange that our American partners don't understand that
we have vital interests in the region. (Americans) say you have
interests there, but it's 10,000 miles away,'' he said.

Clinton To Host Barak, Arafat at Summit
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The leaders of Israel and the Palestinian Authority agreed
to meet at Camp David, Md., next week with President Clinton, who announced the
summit today ''to start drawing the contours of the long-awaited peace.''
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said both sides need to ''seize the
opportunity.'' The chief Palestinian negotiator said the summit comes with ''big
gaps on all the issues.'' But two of Israel's political parties already have
threatened to quit Barak's governing coalition over concern that he might make
too many concessions. That could deprive him of the majority needed to make
peace.

Poll: Dole Good GOP Running Mate
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two women, Elizabeth Dole and Christie Whitman, rank with
the strongest potential candidates to be George W. Bush's running mate, says a
survey that measured the appeal of various Republican and Democratic lineups.
Two men were judged the strongest GOP candidates for vice president in the
national poll by Intersurvey. But both of them -- retired Gen. Colin Powell and
Sen. John McCain -- have said they don't want the job. The presence of a woman
on the ticket could whittle away at the Democrats' usual advantage with female
voters, the poll suggested.

Union, Teachers Closer on Agreement
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- The nation's largest teachers' union took a step closer today
to ending its a century-old resistance to paying teachers for performance,
instead of just seniority. But the union refused to embrace a proposal to base
pay on how well students perform on tests. Leaders of the National Education
Association, in crafting changes to its bargaining policy, insisted the new
''bonus'' pay approach should not replace pay based on seniority, nor subject a
teacher to the whims of a principal.

Hijacking Halted in Jordan; 15 Hurt

   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Three men attempted to hijack a Syria-bound jetliner
late Wednesday, wounding 15 passengers by exploding a small bomb before one
attacker was shot to death by guards, authorities said. The two other suspects
were captured and the Royal Jordanian plane returned safely to Amman, said Capt.
Jihad Irsheid, director general of Jordan's Civil Aviation Department. He said
all the attackers were Syrians. One of the hijackers threw a bomb at security
officials aboard the plane as they tried to prevent him from going into the
cockpit, Irsheid said.

Putin Makes Trip for Chechnya Talks
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- President Vladimir Putin blamed poor military
discipline for heavy Russian losses in suicide truck bombings in Chechnya,
rebuking top officials during a surprise visit Wednesday to the volatile region.
Putin's appearance in neighboring North Ossetia came amid tight security and
high tensions in and around Chechnya, prompted by the Sunday night bombings. The
five truck bombings killed at least 33 soldiers and wounded scores of people and
posed the biggest setback in months to Russian forces trying to re-establish
control over the rebel republic.

Power Outages Threatening U.S.
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As this summer moves into its hottest months, federal
officials and the power industry are keeping a watchful eye on the nation's
electric grids and cautioning that a severe hot spell -- combined with possible
supply problems -- could cause power outages in some parts of the country. As
the $220 billion electricity industry moves toward more competition, there are
growing concerns that the power industry is running too close to the edge in
providing electricity when it is most needed -- during peak summer demand.

Martinez Won't Pitch As All-Star

   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Pedro Martinez won't pitch in the All-Star game, and the
exact reason is unclear. Yesterday, the AL Cy Young Award winner said he would
be able to play. He is on the disabled list with a strained muscle on his left
side and is due to be activated next week. But Martinez wasn't on the American
League's 31-man roster announced today. The commissioner's office said he was a
unanimous pick among AL managers and would be treated as if he were an All-Star,
and Boston officials refused to say if they were prohibiting Martinez from
pitching Tuesday in Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Death of Suspect's Stepdad Protested  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREA CECIL
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Thousands of protesters led by the Rev.
Al Sharpton rallied Wednesday outside a department store where a
black man suffocated while security guards held him in a choke
hold.
</P>
<P>
   About 10,000 people chanting ''No justice, no profits, no
justice, no peace'' gathered in a parking lot outside the Lord &AMP;
Taylor store in this Detroit suburb, according to police estimates.
The doors near the spot where Frederick Finley died were blocked by
police barricades.
</P>
<P>
   No charges have been filed in the June 22 death of the
32-year-old, who was in the store with friends and family when
surveillance cameras allegedly recorded some members of the group
shoplifting.
</P>
<P>
   Security guards followed the group to the parking lot and tried
to detain Finley's stepdaughter and a family friend, police said.
Finley punched one of the guards before he was put in the choke
hold, according to the police report.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne County assistant prosecutor Kevin Simowski said Wednesday
that prosecutors are reviewing the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems that you can go to jail for protesting in Dearborn,
but you can't go to jail for murder,'' Sharpton said at a news
conference Wednesday with Finley's mother. ''I asked the chief of
police, if I lay down in front of Lord &AMP; Taylor tonight, would he
arrest me. He said, 'Absolutely.' But a man can be choked to death
in front of Lord &AMP; Taylor, and we're waiting on what?''
</P>
<P>
   At least some of the Lord &AMP; Taylor guards who were involved are
black. The activists who organized Wednesday's protest accused the
store of having black security workers scrutinize minority shoppers
to avoid the appearance of discrimination or racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   ''It takes racism to a new, clandestine level in corporate
culture,'' said the Rev. Horace Sheffield, a Detroit pastor who
organized the rally.
</P>
<P>
   ''Racism can be black-on-black if white folk have staged this to
be black-on-black. I know that if I'm a company with a white
loss-prevention officer and if I apprehend a black individual and
something happens, it looks far worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Lord &AMP; Taylor spokeswoman LaVelle Olexa declined to discuss
Finley's death or the protest, citing an ongoing police
investigation and a $600 million lawsuit by the man's family
against the store's parent company, May Department Stores.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters cheered as several people, including Sharpton and
activist Dick Gregory, spoke at the rally.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Johnson, 58, of Detroit, said he attended to protest
companies that ''get around civil rights by hiring a minority to
oversee a minority.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who is black, said he believes officials genuinely want
to keep cities safe but are assuming that blacks are criminals. ''I
think they're doing what they think is best, but it's illegal,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   After 1&AMP;frac12; hours, organizers urged the protesters to leave
peacefully, and the crowd quickly dispersed.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have not filed charges in Finley's death or the
alleged shoplifting. Police said store cameras recorded members of
Finley's group removing tags and holders from jewelry and Finley's
stepdaughter putting a $4 bracelet on her wrist.
</P>
<P>
   The case also has caught the attention of the American Civil
Liberties Union of Michigan. The ACLU routinely fields complaints
by minority shoppers who say they were subjected to unreasonable
force and detention in area stores simply because of their race,
said legal director Michael J. Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ACLU is concerned in general about shoppers of color being
targeted because of their race,'' Steinberg said. ''It's a major
problem in the malls or suburbs, where African Americans feel
they're suspect the minute they walk into a store.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every once in a while, there's a high-profile case like this
one which raises awareness of the problem.''

<HEADLINE> Jays' Wells Angry Over SI Piece  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Well, there's another big-league pitcher mad at
Sports Illustrated, and this time it's not because of anything he
said.
</P>
<P>
   David Wells, leading the majors with 14 wins, is upset with this
week's cover story about him in SI. The Toronto pitcher was named
to the AL All-Star team Wednesday and could start the game in
Atlanta next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an honor to be on the cover, but the story is a total
joke,'' Wells said at Jacobs Field where the Blue Jays played the
Indians. ''It's terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   The cover features an action photo of Wells, his shirt
unbuttoned and his belly hanging over his belt with the headline,
''The David Wells Diet: Chips, Beer and American League Batters.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, there is a feature story titled ''Heavy Duty'' written
by Jeff Pearlman, who also wrote the article in which John Rocker
made derogatory remarks about gays and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''All it talks about is me being fat and what I did when I was
in New York basically,'' said Wells, traded by the Yankees just
before last season. ''Read it. It's stupid. The guy screwed John
Rocker and all of a sudden I'm victim No. 2.''
</P>
<P>
   The piece begins, ''David Wells is fat'' and in the first
paragraph Wells' ''fingers and toes, ears and nose, forehead and
chin(s) are fat.''
</P>
<P>
   SI spokesman Joe Assad disputed Wells' characterization of the
story and pointed out that it also describes the pitcher as one of
the best in the game and a good influence in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a bit of a stretch to compare this to the Rocker
situation,'' Assad said. ''We're sorry that he takes offense to
certain points.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells, who is quoted throughout the story, said he didn't even
speak to Pearlman for the article. Assad, however, noted that
quotes are often gathered in group situations in locker rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Wells said he was approached twice by Pearlman, but declined the
interview because SI had reneged on a promise to put him on the
cover after he agreed to do a photo shoot for the magazine while he
was pitching with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto general manager Gord Ash is described as ''mountain of a
man himself'' in the SI article. Ash said he read the story but
declined to comment.

<HEADLINE> Bidding on rare Honus Wagner baseball card starts on eBay  </HEADLINE>
By JOE MANDAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) - The baseball card equivalent of the Hope
Diamond is being auctioned on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The online auction house eBay began accepting bids Wednesday on
a near-mint condition card depicting Hall of Fame shortstop Honus
Wagner of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Bidding on the card, issued in
1909 by the American Tobacco Company, will continue through July
15.
</P>
<P>
   Two bids had been received Wednesday night, the highest for
$550,000, said Kristen Sewell, a spokeswoman for eBay.
</P>
<P>
   Like other collectibles, the card's price is driven by its
rarity and condition - it is the finest specimen of about 50 Wagner
cards known to exist from the 1909 set. But this card's value is
bolstered by an almost harmonic convergence of legend, celebrity
ownership and circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   ''This card represents the hobby's entree into the kind of
prices that fine art gets. There aren't too many other cards that
have the kind of pedigree this card has,'' said T.S. O'Connell,
managing editor of Sports Collectors Digest.
</P>
<P>
   Legend has it that Wagner ordered American Tobacco to pull the
card from circulation because he didn't want his likeness used to
sell tobacco, for fear it would influence children.
</P>
<P>
   That legend has been challenged, with some pointing to a 1948
Leaf bubble gum card that shows Wagner, by then a coach for the
Pirates, stuffing a wad of chewing tobacco in his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, the legend is true, says Robert Lifson,
president of Robert Edward Auctions of Watchung, N.J., which is
offering the card through eBay. He said he has seen newspaper
articles dating back to 1912 that say Wagner did not want the cards
released.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the king of all baseball cards, really a legendary
collecting icon,'' Lifson said. ''This legend is not something
that's just come up. It was the (pre-eminent) baseball card legend
30 years ago, it was the baseball card legend 50 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in 1930, the Wagner card was appraised at $50 by the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, while other cards in
the rare 523-player set were valued at nickels or dimes, Lifson
said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell says Wagner's family rejects claims that the shortstop
pulled the card after the tobacco company refused to pay him more
money for his likeness.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess if it was my grandfather, I'd dispute it, too,''
O'Connell said, adding that he doesn't think money drove Wagner's
decision either.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even into the 1950s and 1960s, players didn't get much more
than a couple hundred bucks and a toaster,'' for letting baseball
card companies use their likeness, O'Connell said.
</P>
<P>
   Lifson said a 1912 newspaper article says Wagner and other
players got $10 each for letting the tobacco company put their
picture on its cards.
</P>
<P>
   That year's series of cards, known to collectors at the T206
set, remains the most collected set of baseball cards ever, Lifson
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Wagner card made history in 1991, when hockey superstar
Wayne Gretzky and Bruce McNall, then owner of the National Hockey
League's Los Angeles Kings, bought it for $461,000.
</P>
<P>
   The card was later sold to Wal-Mart, which raffled it off in a
national promotion. The winner, Patricia Gibbs, a Florida postal
clerk, immediately sold the card so she could afford to pay the
taxes she owed for winning it.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs consigned the card to Christie's of New York City, which
sold the card for $640,500 to renowned collector Michael Gidwitz,
who has owned it ever since.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell and Lifson said publicity about the card's
high-profile ownership will likely drive up the price.
</P>
<P>
   Bids above $500,000 must be in increments of $50,000. Bidders
must register in advance and wire $100,000 into an escrow account
to be qualified.

<HEADLINE> Stage set for Episcopalians' debate on homosexuality  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH KOHLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) - The national convention for America's 2.4 million
Episcopalians opened Wednesday with a divisive issue potentially on
the table: whether individual dioceses can decide to ordain gays
and bless homosexual relationships.
</P>
<P>
   That proposal and other resolutions on the role of homosexuals
in the Episcopal Church will be discussed during the 10-day
meeting, the presiding bishop said Wednesday. But he said they
might not be voted on.
</P>
<P>
   Church leader Frank Griswold said it is more important to reach
common ground on gay issues, which are confronting several other
American denominations as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly, there's a divide,'' Griswold said. ''But I think the
most hopeful thing is that there's a dialogue between bishops about
the question of sexuality so they can understand each other's
context more clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   The main proposal before the Episcopal General Convention would
codify the church's unofficial policy of allowing each diocese to
decide whether to ordain gays and bless same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives say the practice violates church and biblical
teachings. Liberals say the proposed local-option measure doesn't
go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've heard innumerable comments that the local option is what
we have and a resolution that says 'yes' or 'no' to that is
destructive,'' said Marge Christie, a lay delegate from Newark,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Other proposals, many originating in a special committee on
sexuality, would authorize priests to perform gay commitment
ceremonies and direct the church to develop rites for them.
</P>
<P>
   The resolutions must be approved by the church's two-chamber
legislative body, one composed of about 300 bishops and the other
composed of about 800 priests and lay members.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates from both bodies said they did not know when the
resolutions would come up.
</P>
<P>
   ''We never know what kind of horse the convention is going to
ride until we assemble,'' said the Rt. Rev. Clifton Daniel III, a
bishop from North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The Anglican American Council, a group of conservative
Episcopalians, says the ''anything goes'' policy threatens to
divide the church. The group insists it speaks for the church's
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   The Anglican American Council is committed to staying in the
church, but other conservative members may leave. ''I think the
potential is there for a devastating split,'' said Bishop Jim
Stanton of Dallas, the council's president.
</P>
<P>
   Soulforce, a gay and lesbian advocacy group, is demanding that
homosexuals be accepted in the Episcopal Church and other
denominations. Dozens of its members were arrested Tuesday outside
the Colorado Convention Center, the gathering site for the
Episcopalians.
</P>
<P>
   ''For 30 years they've been discussing this. We're asking them
now to resolve it,'' said Mel White, a founder of Soulforce and a
minister in the Metropolitan Community Churches.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Episcopalians parent group, the worldwide
Anglican Communion, called homosexuality ''incompatible with
Scripture.''
</P>
<P>
   The rift widened in January when two American priests who oppose
homosexuality were consecrated as bishops in Singapore - without
church approval - by two conservative bishops.
</P>
<P>
   Similar conflicts are raging within other denominations. The
Evangelical Lutheran Church discourages any blessings of gay
couples, though there are no official rules prohibiting such
unions, and some pastors have said they intend to perform
ceremonies for gays.
</P>
<P>
   United Methodist Church leaders in May reaffirmed their
opposition to homosexuality, the ordination of sexually active gays
and consecrating same-sex unions. Presbyterian leaders recommended
last week that ceremonies blessing same-sex couples be banned.

<HEADLINE> Ship Spills Oil in Narragansett Bay  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- An oil barge spilled more than 9,000
gallons of its cargo into an ecologically sensitive area of
Narragansett Bay on Wednesday, raising concerns about damage to
shore birds and fragile habitats.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard believes the spill was caused when the barge,
heading to a power plant in Somerset, Mass., collided with the tug
boat that was towing it.
</P>
<P>
   The 460-foot barge was carrying more than 10 million gallons of
oil. It was ruptured about two miles from Prudence Island, home to
the Narragansett Bay Estuarine Sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is one of the most valuable areas in Narragansett Bay for
marine life,'' said John Torgan of the environmental group Save The
Bay. ''This is a very serious spill.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said most of the spill was contained, though oil had
washed ashore by afternoon. Five swans found covered with oil were
not expected to survive, Coast Guard officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard planned to corral the oil along the shoreline
during the night and begin cleaning it up Thursday.

<HEADLINE> 10 Bengal Tigers Die at Indian Zoo  </HEADLINE>
By GOPAL DAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   BHUBANESHWAR, India (AP) -- Limping and gasping for breath, 10
sick Royal Bengal tigers -- including seven rare white tigers -- died
one by one at an Indian zoo despite being injected with
antibiotics, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some tigers lay dead in their concrete enclosures at the
Nandankanan Zoo, which houses India's largest collection of Royal
Bengal tigers and the world's largest collection of white tigers.
Workers slung the dead animals on a pole and hauled them to a
building where a team of veterinarians, microbiologists and
pharmacologists conducted autopsies.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very sad day for me. It's very shocking and very sad,''
said S.K. Patnaik, chief wildlife warden at the zoo in the capital
of the southeastern state of Orissa.
</P>
<P>
   The zoo has been struggling to care for its animals since a
devastating cyclone hit the area last year.
</P>
<P>
   Veterinarians had administered the antibiotics after a tiger
died at the zoo. They found the animals had contracted sleeping
sickness, or trypanosomiasis, an illness spread by tsetse flies,
Patnaik said. Seven tigers that received treatment survived, and
some were recovering in an animal hospital, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Patnaik said preliminary autopsies indicated all the tigers died
of the same disease despite the antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a curable disease provided it is diagnosed early. In this
case, it was very difficult to find out if they were sick,'' said
Dr. B.K. Das, a veterinary surgeon at the zoo.
</P>
<P>
   A 12-year-old tiger fell sick last month and died three days
later, Patnaik said. Another tiger came down with similar symptoms
and died on Tuesday, he said. Two other tigers began limping and
gasping in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were hoping that the tigers would respond to the
medicine,'' Patnaik said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This morning, we found three tigers dead in the safari park,''
a corner of the zoo, he said. ''Around noon, the others dropped
dead almost simultaneously,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The zoo had 56 tigers until the first one, a male named Sagar,
died Tuesday night. Patnaik said seven of the dead tigers were
extremely rare, white ones.
</P>
<P>
   S.C. Sharma, a wildlife expert, said crowding at the zoo could
have resulted in poor hygiene, which spread the infection.
</P>
<P>
   The government set up a committee of experts from several
veterinary colleges in the state to try to save the other tigers in
the park.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Host Barak, Arafat  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Facing a deadlock and a deadline, the leaders
of Israel and the Palestinian Authority agreed to meet at Camp
David, Md., next week with President Clinton, who announced the
summit Wednesday ''to start drawing the contours of the
long-awaited peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, facing increasing political
trouble at home, said both sides need to ''seize the opportunity.''
The chief Palestinian negotiator in the bogged-down talks said the
summit comes with ''big gaps on all the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   But two of Israel's political parties already have threatened to
quit Barak's governing coalition over concern that he might make
too many concessions. That could deprive him of the majority needed
to make peace.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, announcing acceptance of his risky invitation at the
White House, said staging a summit has ''its perils.'' But if Barak
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat ''do not seize this moment, if
they cannot make progress now,'' he said, ''there will be more
hostility and more bitterness, perhaps even more violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The talks will begin Tuesday in the seclusion of the
presidential retreat in the Catoctin Mountains. Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators will precede them here, meeting this
weekend with American mediators.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think if we work hard, we can get it done in several days,''
Clinton said. ''But I will give it whatever time is required, as
long as we are still moving forward.''
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, where he was consulting with French President Jacques
Chirac, Barak said, ''We have to be able to seize the opportunity,
exploit it and try to put an end to the conflict, if it's possible,
in a way that keeps the dignity and respect of both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, chief Palestinian negotiator Ahmed Qureia warned:
''We don't have common ground on any of the issues. There are big
gaps on all the issues -- Jerusalem, refugees and borders.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spokesman Joe Lockhart said the president was clearing
away most of his schedule next week so he could spend a lot of time
with Barak and Arafat. ''I'll work as hard as I need to work,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians have lumbered
along for nearly seven years, producing Israeli pullbacks on the
West Bank and Gaza but not making a dent in the core issues of
their half-century dispute. The two sides agreed earlier to reach
agreement on all outstanding issues by Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat wants an independent state on virtually all of the land
the Arabs lost in the 1967 Mideast war, with East Jerusalem, which
Jordan had occupied until then, as its capital.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of Palestinian refugees are claiming a right
to return to Israel, while some 190,000 Israeli Jews have settled
on the West Bank and in Gaza, freshly assured by Barak that most
will be able to remain in redesigned clusters.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis and Palestinians began only in the spring to
negotiate these issues, and even that slowed down in the last month
or so, said a senior U.S. official who briefed reporters on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ''Etched in each side's mind are intense fears and emotions and
deep-seated commitment to defend their peoples' interests,''
Clinton said. ''There are no easy answers and certainly no painless
ones, and therefore there is clearly no guarantee of success.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak, referring to the upcoming deadline, ''We'll do our best
to have an agreement before the 13th of September.''
</P>
<P>
   His badly shaken government, riven with domestic disputes as
well as disagreement over the negotiations, received other shocks
Wednesday: Two parties -- Natan Sharansky's immigrants party and the
National Religious Party -- said they would quit the coalition
government, leaving Barak with a minority of 59 seats in the
120-member Knesset. Sharansky, the one-time Soviet dissident with a
large following among Russian Israelis, also announced he would
resign as interior minister.
</P>
<P>
   Qureia, the Palestinian negotiator, cautioned that to have peace
Israel must do more than give up part of the land for a state. ''I
don't think that this would bring peace to the area,'' he said.
''Rather, it would be the flame that would explode the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   With 6&AMP;frac12; months left in his presidency, Clinton hopes to make a
Middle East peace agreement part of his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   In light of the huge gaps between the two sides, the summit
could result in a partial agreement, although Clinton initially
will drive for an overall accord.
</P>
<P>
   Hinting at a less ambitious goal, the senior U.S. official said,
''We will make progress where we can.'' Barak said the goal was an
agreement that would cover ''most of the issues on the table, maybe
all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's venture mirrors former President Jimmy Carter's
hosting of a summit at Camp David in 1978 between the late Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a peace treaty the next year, the first between
Israel and an Arab nation.

<HEADLINE> Attorneys Blow Whistle on Agency  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER NEWTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Barbers and dentists across Pennsylvania
called them ''the terror team'' -- state prosecutors who handed out
scores of fines for occupational-license violations with
uncompromising efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   A barber who gave a quick trim to a customer on the back porch
of his barber shop was slapped with a $150 fine. A barber who let
Girl Scouts wash cars in his parking lot was fined $250.
</P>
<P>
   Now two of the team's lead attorneys have switched sides and are
suing the state of Pennsylvania, alleging they were forced to
prosecute trivial matters so that the agency could justify its
existence and its expanding budget.
</P>
<P>
   In their lawsuits, they allege what many critics already believe
-- the agency had a quota and picked on small businesses that
couldn't fight back.
</P>
<P>
   ''This system has become a monster, and it is so clearly illegal
that it should make any lawyer sick,'' said former state Auditor
Don Bailey, who is representing attorney Jeffrey Brown in his
lawsuit against the state's Bureau of Professional and Occupational
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is common knowledge that a quota system is unconstitutional
-- and these were lawyers that were doing this! They systematically
went after people who were easy pickings and took advantage of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bureau spokesman Bob Bunty denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ''No quota system exists,'' he said. ''There were performance
goals for various bureau employees, but there were no admonishments
or punishments and no rewards for exceeding those goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Bunty would not comment on the purpose of the goal system.
</P>
<P>
   News of the lawsuit sent cheers through some barber shops that
have received fines in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ''Great! What goes around finally came around,'' said Joe
Gardner, who cuts hair at B.D.'s Barber Shop in Harrisburg. He said
his shop was fined $150 two years ago because there was ''too much
hair on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This has been unfair for years and so I'm not surprised to
hear about this,'' he said. ''You always knew they were just
looking for a reason to slap a fine on you.''
</P>
<P>
   The bureau licenses and regulates numerous professionals,
including doctors, dentists, nurses, accountants, architects,
cosmetologists, barbers and funeral directors. Agency workers
conduct inspections, and state attorneys hand out fines for
violations.
</P>
<P>
   Fines can be disputed, ''but doing so can be more costly than
paying the fine,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuit, filed Monday in federal court, Brown said
managers three years ago started pressuring attorneys to bring in
''bigger numbers'' and actually discussed how many fines they
expected attorneys to hand out.
</P>
<P>
   And more important, Brown said ''the quota system curtailed
prosecution of major illegal activity since these prosecutions were
deemed by supervisors to produce too few numbers of convictions in
relation to the amount of time needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown and co-worker Karen Grigsby said they were fired when they
complained of the system. The bureau would not comment on why they
were fired.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's suit names as defendants the entire management staff of
the licensing agency and a federal judge who allegedly knew about
the system and allowed the fines to continue. The defendants
declined to comment.

<HEADLINE> Mets' Alfonzo Gets $750,000 Bonus  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- New York Mets second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo is
an All-Star on the field and at the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo earned $750,000 for his selection Wednesday to the
National League team: a $250,000 bonus plus raises of $250,000 in
the final two seasons of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   He is making $4.1 million this year in a four-year deal he
agreed to in February 1999, a package that originally guaranteed
him a minimum $18.4 million and already has been increased because
he won a Silver Slugger award last year.
</P>
<P>
   Because he made the All-Star team, his salary rises to $5.85
million in 2001 and $6,075,000 in 2002. If Alfonzo makes the
All-Star team again next year, his 2002 salary would increase to
$6,575,000.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal outfielder Vladimir Guerrero also was a big cash
winner. He gets a $25,000 bonus now, and his salary in 2002, the
final year of his contract, increases by $250,000 to $10.25
million.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-one players earned a total of $1,915,000 in bonuses for
making the All-Star game, while 20 of the All-Stars didn't have
bonuses involving the game that will be played Tuesday in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Three players earned $100,000 each: Los Angeles pitcher Kevin
Brown, Baltimore third baseman Cal Ripken and Seattle pitcher Aaron
Sele.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen players get $50,000 apiece, while 14 get $25,000
apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers outfielder Gary Sheffield gets $20,000, and three
members of the Chicago White Sox get the smallest bonuses of
$15,000 each: pitcher James Baldwin, infielder Ray Durham and
outfielder Magglio Ordonez.

<HEADLINE> Gore Challenges Drug Industry Group  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore criticized ''phony''
critics of his health proposals Wednesday, saying big drug
companies are plowing millions of dollars into a group that runs
ads against him rather than into research.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spoke to a convention of the American Federation of
Teachers, but focused more on health care than education. His
strongest fire was aimed at those critical of his plan to expand
Medicare to cover prescription drug costs.
</P>
<P>
   He released a letter in which he had demanded that Citizens for
Better Medicare, which has spent millions on television attacking
his Medicare plan, make public its donor lists.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know, at least there ought to be a little truth in
advertising,'' said Gore, telling the teachers a more fitting name
would be ''Citizens for Bad Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   He accused the group of ''polluting the public airwaves with
special-interest TV ads designed to deceive the American people
about a prescription drug benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   At least three of Republican George W. Bush's advisers have ties
to the drug industry: Former Rep. Vin Weber's lobbying firm clients
include the pharmaceutical association that funds the industry
group, and also Schering-Plough; former Republican National
Chairman Haley Barbour lobbies for Bristol Myers Squibb, and
Charles Black's firm lobbies for Johnson &AMP; Johnson and Smith Kline
Beecham.
</P>
<P>
   One Gore adviser, former Rep. Thomas Downey, lobbies for Merck &AMP;
Co. Another, Peter Knight, lobbied for Schering-Plough before his
firm disbanded.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has proposed a 10-year, $255 billion expansion of Medicare
that he says would cover 40 million people. He says the idea is
being fought by pharmaceutical companies eager to protect record
profits.
</P>
<P>
   ''And not all of that money is going back into research,'' Gore
said. ''In fact, millions of dollars are going into a phony
coalition called Citizens for Better Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Zielinski, a spokesman for the group, said it was reviewing
his letter, which it received Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Gore's Medicare proposal say it would be very
expensive and would actually endanger the health program.
</P>
<P>
   One of the goals of Gore's four-week swing is to rally core
Democratic voters, which he focused on in later remarks to
thousands of activists at an African-American church convention in
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are those who want to go back,'' said Gore. ''We've got
to decide to keep going and make sure no one is left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore reminded his audience that African-American unemployment
has fallen to record lows in the last eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing good happens without a tough fight,'' said Gore.
''We've got to choose between the people and the powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech to the teachers union, Gore also touted his plan
to expand health coverage to include all children. He said that
keeping a child healthy is key to offering a quality education.
</P>
<P>
   He was focusing on his health proposals before the teachers
union in Philadelphia, where Republicans in a little over three
weeks hold their nominating convention, and in Chicago before the
National Education Association on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As for including prescription drugs under Medicare, he said,
''You know as well as I do, prescription drugs are not at the
margins of health care. They are often the heart of treatment and
cure.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore seeks to cast Bush as siding with entrenched and powerful
interests while the Democrat sides with working families.
</P>
<P>
   Those interests include ''the big drug companies who right now
are trying to pull the wool over the country's eyes,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies argue that their profits are needed to pay for
research into new drugs, but Gore said, ''They are now spending
more money on advertising than they are on innovation.''
</P>
<P>
   He urged the group that has been running TV spots against him to
''publicly release the list of donors who are actually financing
their ads.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides arranged a conference call with Vermont Gov. Howard Dean,
a backer and a physician, to talk about the health issue in the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the area where there's the starkest difference between
the vice president and Governor Bush,'' said Dean, who contended
big drug-makers fought his own efforts to upgrade health coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ''The performance of the pharmaceutical industry has been a
disgrace,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Sting 76, Sol 70  </HEADLINE>
By JENNA FRYER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Rhonda Mapp scored 20 points -- including
the 1,000th point of her career -- as the Charlotte Sting won their
first home game of the season Wednesday night, 76-70 over the Miami
Sol.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte (3-13) lost a WNBA-record nine straight home games
before the victory. The Sting, who have lost 18 of their last 21
regular-season games, snapped a five-game overall losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Mapp, who scored her milestone points on her first basket of the
game, hit two free throws with 22 seconds to play to seal the
victory, and also had a game-high nine rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Miami (5-11), an expansion team, lost despite getting a career-
high 26 points from Sheri Sam.
</P>
<P>
   Sam hit a 3-pointer to tie it at 68 with 4:34 to play. But
Andrea Stinson and Shalonda Enis hit consecutive jumpers to put
Charlotte up 72-68 with 2:50 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Black hit two free throws to cut it to 72-70. After
turnovers by both teams, the Sol missed a chance to take the lead
when Black's 3-point attempt fell short with 34 seconds to go. Mapp
got the rebound and was fouled by Black. She hit both free throws
to give the Sting a 74-70 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Sam then missed a 3-pointer, Stinson got the rebound and was
fouled and hit both her free throws to seal the win.
</P>
<P>
   Enis finished with 16 points and Stinson scored 13.
</P>
<P>
   Katrina Colleton had 14 points for Miami and Marlies Askamp
scored all 12 of her points in the second half.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Keeps Elian From Public View  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- A shy, but joyful Elian Gonzalez was seen riding
his bicycle in his hometown and splashing in a pool at a nearby
resort as state television Wednesday night aired some of the first
images of the boy since his return to Cuba a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   With soft music playing in the background, the video clips
chronicled part of the surprise visit Elian and his family made
Tuesday afternoon to Cardenas, where the child was born and raised.
On the streets of the small port city, scores of residents cheered
as a bus carrying the family drove by.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-year-old was shown curiously rummaging through his clothes
and toys at the homes of his paternal and maternal grandparents. He
looked thrilled to find a pair of inline skates, which he tried on
over his bare feet and skated a bit down a hallway.
</P>
<P>
   At his school, Elian was greeted by his classmates, and a
teacher leaned down to show him pictures and something written in a
book.
</P>
<P>
   The clips were shown shortly before Elian's father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, was to receive one of Cuba's top civilian awards for his
fight to bring his son Elian back to Cuba. President Fidel Castro
was in the audience as the ceremony got under way.
</P>
<P>
   The television images were the first new glimpse of the boy seen
by the Cuban public since Thursday, the day after he returned. At
the time, state television showed repeatedly showed images of
Elian's airport homecoming and a brief clip of him playing with
children around his age the evening of his return.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Gonzalez was to receive the Carlos Manuel de Cespedes
Medal late Wednesday in his first public appearance since he and
his son returned home a week ago. Elian was not expected to be
there.
</P>
<P>
   The award is for ''extraordinary behavior in the tough battle
for the liberation of Elian,'' state media reported.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony was being broadcast live on television from
Havana's Karl Marx theater, and was attended by Communist Party
leaders, government officials and others who participated in the
more than 100 rallies, marches and other events held over seven
months in Cuba's fight to bring Elian back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials characterized the medal as one of several
equally important national honors. Cespedes was a hero in Cuba's
war for independence and the father of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba says Elian gave a human face to its four-decade political
battle with the United States, allowing many ordinary Americans
their first close look at the communist nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''With Elian, coverage has been given to an affair that
habitually was a theme only for political scientists and
specialists,'' Ricardo Alarcon, president of Cuba's National
Assembly, said in an interview published Wednesday in a special
newspaper supplement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Millions of people, housewives, people with nothing to do with
this, soon began to see the story of a Cuban boy as the daily top
news event,'' he said of how Americans followed the case. Over
time, many U.S. citizens grew to sympathize with the child and
question American immigration and other policies toward the
Caribbean country.
</P>
<P>
   The supplement, titled ''Elian in the homeland,'' wrapped up
events leading up to and including Elian's return on June 28.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials long promised to prevent the kind of massive
media coverage the child experienced during the five months he
stayed with his Miami relatives while they fought to keep him in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami kin were given temporary custody of the boy after he
was rescued off the Florida coast. Elian's mother and 10 others
perished during a sea journey from Cuba to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The government forbade large public displays for the homecoming
and journalists have been kept away since from the seaside Havana
house where Elian is staying with his family.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba has said that the fight sparked by the Elian custody
dispute did not end with the child's return. Rallies, marches,
special television programs will continue to attack American
policies toward the island.

Clinton To Host Barak, Arafat at Summit
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The leaders of Israel and the Palestinian Authority agreed
to meet at Camp David, Md. next week with President Clinton, who announced the
summit today ''to start drawing the contours of the long-awaited peace.''
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said both sides need to ''seize the
opportunity.'' The chief Palestinian negotiator said the summit comes with ''big
gaps on all the issues.'' But two of Israel's political parties already have
threatened to quit Barak's governing coalition over concern that he might make
too many concessions. That could deprive him of the majority needed to make
peace.

Audit: Taxpayers Overpaid $25M

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thousands of taxpayers overpaid $25 million in income
taxes that should have been credited to their accounts or refunded by the
Internal Revenue Service, according to an independent audit that cites computer
problems as the main culprit. Thousands more individuals, families and
businesses forfeited their rights to refunds or credits, or were at risk of
doing so, that totaled $335 million. These taxpayers failed to file late tax
returns in time for legal deadlines to qualify for the money. The IRS says it
has returned or credited the money owed.

10 Bengal Tigers Die at Indian Zoo

<P>
   BHUBANESHWAR, India (AP) -- Limping and gasping for breath, 10 sick Royal
Bengal tigers -- including seven rare white tigers -- died one by one at an
Indian zoo despite being injected with antibiotics, officials said Wednesday.
The Nandankanan Zoo houses India's largest collection of Royal Bengal tigers and
the world's largest collection of white tigers. Preliminary autopsies indicated
all the tigers died of the same disease -- sleeping sickness, or
trypanosomiasis, an illness spread by tsetse flies -- despite antibiotics, said
S.K. Patnaik, chief wildlife warden at the zoo.

Poll: Dole Good GOP Running Mate
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two women, Elizabeth Dole and Christie Whitman, rank with
the strongest potential candidates to be George W. Bush's running mate, says a
survey that measured the appeal of various Republican and Democratic lineups.
Two men were judged the strongest GOP candidates for vice president in the
national poll by Intersurvey. But both of them -- retired Gen. Colin Powell and
Sen. John McCain -- have said they don't want the job. The presence of a woman
on the ticket could whittle away at the Democrats' usual advantage with female
voters, the poll suggested.

pay on how well students perform on tests. Leaders of the National Education
Association, in crafting changes to its bargaining policy, insisted the new
''bonus'' pay approach should not replace pay based on seniority, nor subject a
teacher to the whims of a principal.

games of the series to open a 10-game lead over second-place Cincinnati in the
NL Central, their first double-digit lead since Sept. 21, 1968. They've won 17
of their last 22, while the Reds have dropped 19 of 28.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Vickie Johnson and Becky Hammon scored 15 points
apiece as the New York Liberty beat the expansion Portland Fire
62-45 on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Tari Phillips added 12 points and 10 rebounds for the Liberty
(8-9), who snapped a two-game losing streak. Sophia Witherspoon led
the Fire (4-11) with nine points and Sylvia Crawley added eight.
</P>
<P>
   New York had a season-high 14 steals, including five from
Phillips, who had her seventh double-double.
</P>
<P>
   Tied at 24 at halftime, New York opened a 33-25 lead on Hammon's
3-pointer. Portland came within 35-33 on Stacy Thomas' two free
throws.
</P>
<P>
   But a layup by Phillips, two layups by Hammon and a baseline
jumper by Johnson extended New York's lead to 43-33.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's 3-pointer capped the 13-0 run for a 48-33 lead with
7:20 left. Michele VanGorp's jumper snapped the Fire's six-minute
scoring drought.

   Portland shot 25 percent from the field and went 2-for-13 from
3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   Hammon scored six points in a 9-0 New York run for a 20-12 lead
with 8:15 remaining in the first half. The Liberty scored just four
points the rest of the period as Phillips ended a five-minute
scoring drought with a layup and Weatherspoon made two free throws
for a 24-17 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Portland went on a 7-0 run, capped by Vanessa Nygaard's
3-pointer, to tie it at 24 at halftime.

<HEADLINE> Impeachment of Justice Recommended  </HEADLINE>
By GENE JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- A legislative committee recommended New
Hampshire's chief justice be impeached for ethics violations, a
pivotal moment in a constitutional crisis that began with a divorce
case.
</P>
<P>
   Two other Supreme Court justices under scrutiny in the same
investigation avoided punishment. Members of the House Judiciary
Committee voted earlier Wednesday not to recommend impeachment or
reprimand either.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's recommendations are expected to be put to a vote
of the full House next week.
</P>
<P>
   After six hours of debate, the House Judiciary Committee voted
that there was enough evidence that Chief Justice David Brock may
have perjured himself to warrant sending the matter to the Senate
for a trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''There seems to be a pattern here of deception. It may be over
small things, but some of these small things contributed to
obstruction of justice,'' said Keene Democrat Benjamin DePecol.
</P>
<P>
   The three judges -- Brock, Sherman Horton and John Broderick --
were accused of initially failing to blow the whistle on
then-Justice Stephen Thayer when he tried to influence the
appointment of judges to hear an appeal in his own divorce. Thayer
resigned after the scandal broke in March.
</P>
<P>
   Committee members said months of investigation and publicity had
done enough to damage Horton's and Broderick's reputations.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they haven't gotten any message from this, then they're
dead from the neck up,'' Rep. James Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   The last time a New Hampshire Supreme Court justice was
impeached was in 1790. That judge, Woodbury Langdon, described as
''arbitrary and haughty,'' resigned before his Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   At issue was whether Brock:
</P>
<P>
   -- Intervened in a state senator's case in 1987 because the
senator could help win pay raises for the bench.
</P>
<P>
   -- Placed the court's confidentiality above the need to report
misconduct by other justices.
</P>
<P>
   -- Entertained Thayer's attempt to influence his own divorce
case.
</P>
<P>
   -- Let justices take part in discussions of cases from which they
were disqualified.
</P>
<P>
   -- Perjured himself by denying under oath actions others have
insisted he took.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation began in April after Attorney General Philip
McLaughlin said that while investigating Thayer he came across
ethics violations by the rest of the court.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before the committee last month, Brock apologized
for poor judgment but said he meant no harm. He said he knew
immediately that Thayer acted inappropriately, and he believed he
was reacting to a sensitive situation in the best possible way.
</P>
<P>
   Disclosure of Thayer's intervention prompted a group of ex-wives
of other New Hampshire judges to threaten a lawsuit in April. The
women argue they were unable to get competent lawyers or decent
divorce settlements because of their husbands' influence.
</P>
<P>
   Justices are nominated by the governor and confirmed by the
state Executive Council, an elected body that reviews nominations
and contracts. Justices serve until they reach the mandatory
retirement age of 70.
</P>
<P>
   That was an issue for some committee members in clearing Justice
Sherman Horton, who is nearing retirement. Other lawmakers said
they trusted the second judge, John Broderick, to work to reform
the court.
</P>
<P>
   Both judges were accused of protecting Thayer's actions; Horton
also was accused of improperly speaking out on the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you boil it all down, for me, the thing you would condemn
Justice Horton for is being a human being, and we need those on the
court,'' Rep. Andrew Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   Broderick had said he hesitated about reporting Thayer because
he was concerned about the turmoil in Thayer's personal and
professional life.

<HEADLINE> Mariners' Sele Named an All-Star  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Aaron Sele phoned his wife Jennifer on
Wednesday and told her to cancel the hotel reservations they had
made in San Diego for the All-Star break. They're going to Turner
Field instead.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really hadn't been thinking about it,'' the Seattle Mariners
right-hander said after making the All-Star team for the second
time. ''We were going to take our 8-month-old daughter to the beach
just to relax, have a good time and get ready for the second half.
Those were our plans up until a couple of hours ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be a tough trip to Atlanta for them, but
anything that's exciting and fun like this, I don't want my family
to miss,''
</P>
<P>
   Mariners designated hitter Edgar Martinez will be making his
fifth All-Star trip, his first since 1997. He began Wednesday
leading the majors with 86 RBIs -- matching his 1999 total -- and was
fifth in the AL with a .352 average.
</P>
<P>
   ''The All-Star game wasn't in my mind, but it was in my mind to
have a good year and be in the playoffs,'' said the three-time AL
batting champ, who homered off Greg Maddux in the 1997 All-Star
game. ''Every time I go, it's a thrill to be with that group of
players. So it will be a thrill to be there one more time.''
</P>
<P>
   Sele and Rodriguez will be joined by teammate Alex Rodriguez,
who was voted in by the fans as the starting AL shortstop for the
third time in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Sele, 10-3 with a 4.21 ERA, was on the AL team two years ago at
Coors Field in Denver but didn't get to pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be fun to pitch down there, but whether you pitch or
not, that's really not the most important thing,'' Sele said.
''It's going down there and being there for the experience.''

<HEADLINE> Erstad, Glaus First-Time All-Stars  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Darin Erstad and Troy Glaus, complete
novices at this All-Star selection stuff, were anxiously awaiting
the end of their impromptu dugout press conferences so they could
focus on Wednesday's game.
</P>
<P>
   It probably explains why they were the only Anaheim Angels who
will be represented at this year's midsummer classic next Tuesday
night in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't play the game for numbers, we don't play the game for
individual accolades and we don't play for individual awards,''
said Glaus, a second-year third baseman hitting .293 with 23 homers
and 54 RBIs at the time of his selection.
</P>
<P>
   ''I play to win games, and whatever comes out of that is
whatever comes out of that. If we're winning, it doesn't really
matter. The bottom line is winning ballgames. If I'm voted to it,
great, because that means I was having a good year and I was doing
what my job was to help my team win.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad, the Angels' left fielder, was leading the majors with
133 hits prior to the third game of a four-game set against AL
West-leading Seattle. He also had hit 16 homers, 59 RBIs and 63
runs scored from the leadoff spot. The closest he has ever come to
an All-Star game was his television set.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's not my focus. I'm not driven by going to the All-Star
game,'' Erstad said. ''I didn't go out and play yesterday or two
months ago with the idea of having to play hard so that I could
make the All-Star game, but it's an honor and I'm happy to be
going. It's always nice to see a new ballpark and go somewhere
you've never been. It's kind of a special moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Midway through his fourth full season in the majors, the former
Nebraska Cornhuskers punter and placekicker already has surpassed
his career bests in homers and RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ball looks he same to me as it's always looked,'' Erstad
said. ''I've prepared the same way I prepared last year, but this
year I'm not missing the mistakes that they're throwing. I've been
working real hard, I have a good game plan and I'm not throwing
away too many at-bats. But for whatever reason, the hits are
falling.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaus and Erstad are only the second pair of position players to
represent the Angels in an All-Star game since 1983 -- and the first
since 1995, when shortstop Gary DiSarcina and center fielder Jim
Edmonds were selected.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's something that I dreamed about since I was a little
kid,'' Glaus said. ''Every kid wants to play in the All-Star game,
and now that I get a chance to, it's something that I'll really
take to heart and enjoy. It'll be fun. I mean, I've seen it on TV,
but it's obviously different in person than it is on TV.''

<HEADLINE> Ramos Back on U.S. Soccer Team  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Oft-injured midfielder Tab Ramos, who hasn't
played on the U.S. national team since the 1998 World Cup, was
picked Wednesday for the roster in the Americans' opening two
qualifiers for the 2002 tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got to the point where I thought I might never play --
period,'' Ramos said. ''It's been difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, who had byes in the early rounds of qualifying,
open the regional semifinals with road games at Guatemala on July
16 and at Costa Rica on July 23.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos, 33, is the only player on the roster who appeared in the
1990, '94 and '98 World Cups, but he fell so far down the pecking
order that his biography wasn't even included in the U.S. team's
media guide this year.
</P>
<P>
   The playmaking midfielder had his skull fractured by Brazil's
Leonardo during the 1994 World Cup. He had two major knee
operations before the 1998 tournament, where the Americans finished
last in the 32-nation field, then injured a hamstring just before
this year's Major League Soccer season opened.
</P>
<P>
   ''I spent 10 months without playing a game,'' Ramos said. ''Out
of those 10 months, I spent seven of them two weeks away from
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks, playing for the New York/New Jersey
MetroStars, his form finally approached that of the early 1990s,
when he directed the U.S. offense, a task that has fallen to
Claudio Reyna in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ''It takes a while to get your form, first physically and then
technically, to make fast decisions on the field,'' Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
   When the U.S. teams goes on the road in qualifying, it often
faces hostile grounds and plays on poor fields.
</P>
<P>
   The opener, originally scheduled for Guatemala City on July 15,
was pushed back a day, the U.S. Soccer Federation said Wednesday,
and moved to Mazatenango, which is 100 miles east of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully, I'll be able to help them, not only on the field,
but off the field,'' Ramos said. ''Obviously, experience has a lot
to do with it. ''Obviously, these are very difficult conditions.
You get all kinds of things thrown at you. Somehow, you have to
keep your focus and concentrate on what's between the lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramos has seven goals in 78 international appearances,
connecting against Costa Rica for his first international goal in
1989 and in a World Cup qualifier three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tab has shown that he can definitely add something to the
national team,'' U.S. coach Bruce Arena said. ''His recent form
with his club team has been outstanding, and he has experience
playing World Cup qualifiers on the road, so he's a natural fit for
the team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans will be missing injured forwards Brian McBride
(broken cheekbone), and Joe-Max Moore (knee), but defender Eddie
Pope, who missed last month's U.S. Cup tournament following knee
surgery, is healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Ten of the 18 players are on MLS teams.
</P>
<P>
   The American team will gather July 10 at Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
leave for Guatemala on July 14 and return to Florida immediately
after the game for a week of training ahead of the Costa Rica game.
</P>
<P>
   After the road games, the U.S. team has home games against
Barbados (Aug. 16 at Foxboro, Mass.), Guatemala (Sept. 3 at
Washington) and Costa Rica (Oct. 11 at Columbus, Ohio) before
finishing at Barbados on Nov. 15. The top two teams in the
four-team group advance to next year's six-nation regional finals,
which will produce three qualifiers for the 32-nation field.
</P>
<P>
   The full roster:
</P>
<P>
   Goalkeepers--Brad Friedel (Liverpool, England), Kasey Keller
(Rayo Vallecano, Spain).
</P>
<P>
   Defenders--Jeff Agoos (DC United), Chad Deering (Dallas), Robin
Fraser (Los Angeles), Eddie Pope (DC United), David Regis (Metz,
France).
</P>
<P>
   Midfielders--Chris Armas (Chicago), Frankie Hejduk (Bayer
Leverkusen, Germany), Cobi Jones (Los Angeles), Eddie Lewis
(Fulham, England), Ben Olsen (DC United), Tab Ramos (New York/New
Jersey), Claudio Reyna (Glasgow Rangers, Scotland), Tony Sanneh
(Hertha Berlin, Germany).
</P>
<P>
   Forwards--Jason Kreis (Dallas), Ante Razov (Chicago), Earnie
Stewart (NAC Breda, Netherlands).

<HEADLINE> Potential Power Outages by Region  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   A regional assessment of potential electricity supply
problems
this summer by the North American Electric Reliability Council, an
industry group, that monitors the nation's power grid.
New England-New York:
<TEXT>
<P>
   May not be able to maintain required reserve during peak
demands, requiring possible cutback in uses by some commercial
customers. Region has 1,000 megawatts of additional generating
capacity this summer, but that is partly offset by growth in demand
and, in New York, the shutdown of the 930-megawatt Indian Point
nuclear power plant. Peak demand expected to be 3 percent higher
this year than last summer in New England, and slightly lower than
last year in New York.
Southeast:
</P>
<P>
   No major problems expected. Supply is much better this year with
new power plants providing 10,000 megawatts of new capacity in the
region this summer. No serious supply problems anticipated.
Additional power, destined to be sold outside the region, could be
available in case of a regional shortage. Demand in southeast below
last year, while supplies are improved.
Mid-Atlantic Area:
</P>
<P>
   Area has 1,314 megawatts of additional capacity compared to last
summer when the region was hit by power outages, prompted by
wholesale electric grid transmission problems, now believed
resolved. Peak demand expected to be below last summer, while
generating capacity has increased. Area expected to have sufficient
generating capacity to meet peak demand, assuming normal summer
weather, but could have supply problems with extremely hot weather.
Midwest:
</P>
<P>
   The east-central area including Ohio Valley expected to have
higher peak demand this year than last summer, but also has greater
capacity than last summer. Abnormally hot, humid weather, or
unexpected problems in generation could require some commercial
customers to reduce demand, especially if power can't be purchased
from outside the region.
</P>
<P>
   Improved supply picture in Illinois, eastern Wisconsin and
eastern Missouri, compared to last summer when this area had
problems. All nuclear generation expected to be available this
summer. More than 3,000 megawatts of additional capacity from new
gas-fired plants. Utility in Chicago area has improved distribution
system that caused problems last summer.
North-Central:
</P>
<P>
   Peak demand expected to be 4 percent greater than last summer.
Only modest increases in new generation (80 megawatts). Still, area
is not expected to have power disruptions.
South-Central:
</P>
<P>
   More than 5,000 megawatts of new generating capacity in Texas is
expected to provide enough electricity to meet demand. Demand
expected to be only slightly more than last year when the summer
had above average temperatures. Transmission systems are expected
to meet demand. Severe drought conditions could cause a problem
with some generation because of a lack cooling water at power
plants. But utilities report contingency plans in place to deal
with this problem.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma-Kansas area expected to have continued annual peak
demand growth of about 2 percent a year and modest generating
capacity increases. Safety margin for the peak month of August
under 11 percent, below minimum. Some supply concerns if summer is
especially hot and some unexpected generation problems develop.
California-Southwest:
</P>
<P>
   California already has had rolling blackouts in San Francisco
Bay area and state-wide calls for curtailing power by commercial
customers because of supply problems. State's safety margin dropped
to below 5 percent of capacity on three days last week during
especially hot weather and reduction in availability of electricity
from outside the state.
</P>
<P>
   Western region is widely interconnected and problems in one area
can affect another. The region may need to make further public
appeals this summer for customers to reduce electricity
consumption, especially if temperatures remain unusually high as
has been the case in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico, Arizona, southern Nevada and California may not have
adequate resources to meet needs in event of a widespread severe
heat wave or greater than normal problems at power plants.
Utilities may not be able to serve all peak demands, resulting in
rolling blackouts.
Northwest-Rocky Mountains:
</P>
<P>
   The Northwest has adequate supplies even with unusually severe
summer temperatures as were recently experienced. But region may
have to curtailed shipments of electricity outside region, mainly
to California. Such shipments were halted after problems developed
with several generating plants, including Washington state's only
nuclear power plant, earlier this month when temperatures reached
the 90s.
</P>
<P>
   The region normally exports electricity and should not have
problems meeting regional needs, however.
</P>
<P>
   Power supplies are expected to be adequate in the Rocky Mountain
area. It is projected to have 16 percent capacity margin, which is
above national average. Transmission systems and reserves are
adequate to meet peak summer needs.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays 4, Tigers 1  </HEADLINE>
By FRED GOODALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Ozzie Guillen snapped a sixth-inning
tie with a two-run homer as the Tampa Bay Devil Rays stopped
Detroit's season-high, five-game winning streak with a 4-1 victory
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Rekar (3-4) allowed seven hits in 6 1-3 innings to win the
first time in six starts since June 1. Jim Mecir bailed him out of
a jam in the sixth, and Roberto Hernandez worked the ninth for his
12th save in 17 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Guillen's second homer, off Jeff Weaver (5-7), snapped a 1-1 tie
and ruined the Tigers' bid to sweep consecutive three-game series
for the first time since winning all six games on a road trip
against the Rangers and White Sox in April 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Damion Easley hit his fifth homer for Detroit's only run off
Rekar, who struck out two and walked none.
</P>
<P>
   Easley's second-inning homer was his second in three nights. He
drove the ball to virtually the same spot in center field that he
hit a game-winning, 10th-inning solo shot off Hernandez on Monday
night. Those were his only two hits of the series.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays tied it 1-1 on a play in which Tampa Bay's Bobby
Smith and Detroit first baseman Robert Fick were injured. Smith's
infield single drove in Gerald Williams from third base, but Smith
toppled over Fick as he crossed first and both players went down.
</P>
<P>
   Smith left the game with a sprained right knee, and Fick was
being examined for an injured right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver allowed three runs on seven hits, struck out four and
walked four. He threw 121 pitches before being replaced by Matt
Anderson with two outs in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Despite winning, the Devil Rays continued to struggle at the
plate with runners in scoring position. They were 2-for-11, with
Smith's infield single ending a stretch of 17 scoreless innings,
and finished the series 3-for-26.
</P>
<P>
   Williams added an RBI single in the eighth off Danny Patterson.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Juan Gonzalez was back in Detroit's lineup at DH after
missing two games with a sore left ankle, however 1B Tony Clark sat
out a third straight day because of back spasms. Gonzalez, who was
4-for-6 with three homers against Rekar before Wednesday night,
went 1-for-3 against the Devil Rays right-hander. ... Tampa Bay's
Jose Guillen is 9-for-58 in 16 games since June 17, dropping his
average from .290 to .242. ... The Devil Rays likely will activate
OF Greg Vaughn (strained right hamstring) from the disabled list
Friday. He hasn't played since June 15, but is still second on the
team in home runs with 13 -- two fewer than Fred McGriff, who has
101 more at-bats.

   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Troy Glaus, a complete novice at this
All-Star selection stuff, was anxiously awaiting the end of his
impromptu dugout press conference so he could focus on Wednesday's
game.
</P>
<P>
   It probably explains why Glaus is joining Anaheim Angels
teammate and major league hit leader Darin Erstad on the foul line
at Turner Field next Tuesday night for the introductions prior to
this year's All-Star game.

   ''I play to win games, and whatever comes out of that is
whatever comes out of that. If we're winning, it doesn't really
matter. The bottom line is winning ballgames. If I'm voted to it,
great, because that means I was having a good year and I was doing
what my job was to help my team win.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad, the Angels' left fielder, was leading the majors with
133 hits prior to the third of a four-game set against AL
West-leading Seattle. He also hit 16 homers, 59 RBIs and 63 runs
scored from the leadoff spot. This will be his second All-Star
appearance; he had two at-bats at Coors Field in 1998 and scored a
run.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's not my focus. I'm not driven by going to the All-Star
game,'' Erstad said. ''I didn't go out and play yesterday or two
months ago with the idea of having to play hard so that I could
make the All-Star game, but it's an honor and I'm happy to be
going. It's always nice to see a new ballpark and go somewhere
you've never been. It's kind of a special moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Midway through his fourth full season in the majors, the former
Nebraska Cornhuskers punter and placekicker already surpassed his
career bests in homers and RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ball looks he same to me as it's always looked,'' Erstad
said. ''I've prepared the same way I prepared last year, but this
year I'm not missing the mistakes that they're throwing. I've been
working real hard, I have a good game plan and I'm not throwing
away too many at-bats. But for whatever reason, the hits are
falling.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaus and Erstad are only the second pair of position players to
represent the Angels in an All-Star game since 1983 -- and the first
since 1995, when shortstop Gary DiSarcina and center fielder Jim
Edmonds were selected.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's something that I dreamed about since I was a little
kid,'' Glaus said. ''Every kid wants to play in the All-Star game,
and now that I get a chance to, it's something that I'll really
take to heart and enjoy. It'll be fun. I mean, I've seen it on TV,
but it's obviously different in person than it is on TV.''

<HEADLINE> Mets 11, Marlins 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Mike Hampton had three hits and allowed just four.
</P>
<P>
   While Hampton shut down Florida for six innings and drove in a
run, Derek Bell hit a three-run homer for the second straight game
and went 3-for-6 with three runs scored as the New York Mets beat
the Marlins 11-2 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton (8-5) won for the sixth time in seven decisions
following a 2-4 start, allowing two runs -- one earned, including
Preston Wilson's sixth-inning homer. He struck out five and walked
two, stopping the Marlins' season-high, five-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton also singled in the second, sixth and seventh innings,
driving in Todd Zeile with his last one. By going 3-for-4 with the
second three-hit game of his career, he raised his average to .318
(14-for-44).
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Smith (0-2), a 30-year-old rookie, allowed five runs -- two
earned -- and eight hits in five innings. He has not given up more
than three earned runs in any of his five starts.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza, whose 21-game hitting streak was stopped Tuesday,
was 2-for-4 with an RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza's RBI single and Robin Ventura's run-scoring grounder put
New York ahead in the first, but Florida got a run in the bottom
half when Mark Kotsay reached on an error by shortstop Melvin Mora
and scored on Cliff Floyd's double.
</P>
<P>
   New York made it 5-1 in the third when Smith fumbled Jay
Payton's bases-loaded roller for an error and Benny Agbayani
followed with a two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton singled off Joe Strong leading off the sixth, Mora
walked and Bell hit his 12th homer, matching his entire total last
season.
</P>
<P>
   New York scored twice in the seventh on Hampton's single, which
gave him five RBIs this season, and Mora's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Agbayani, who was 3-for-5, tripled and scored when reliever Eric
Cammack tripled in his first major-league at-bat.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Hampton also had three hits against Colorado for Houston
last July 28. ... Marlins RHP A.J. Burnett, on the mend from a
damaged thumb, pitched 2 2-3 innings for the Class A Brevard County
Manatees against the Fort Myers Miracle. He didn't give up a hit
and had four strikeouts and three walks. He's expected to join the
Marlins after the All-Star break. ... Florida 2B Luis Castillo sat
out with a stomach virus. ... Payton's single in the seventh
extended his career-best hitting streak to 14.

<HEADLINE> Book: Mayor's father was in a shootout in 1960s  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A biography of law-and-order Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani claims his father fired a gun at a man during a Brooklyn
shootout, and that Giuliani himself once slugged a guy who ogled
his date.
</P>
<P>
   The book, ''Rudy: An Investigative Biography of Rudolph
Giuliani,'' was written by Village Voice reporter Wayne Barrett and
portions of it were printed in this week's Voice. Additionally, the
publisher, Basic Books, on Wednesday gave reporters about 50 pages
from the book, due for publication next week.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has refused to comment on the book. His press secretary
refused again Wednesday to discuss the latest release from the
manuscript. Spokeswoman Sunny Mindel said, ''The mayor hasn't seen
this and therefore he has no comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrett alleges Giuliani's father, Harold Giuliani, served a
one-and-a-half year prison term in Sing Sing prison after robbing a
milkman at gunpoint in 1934, a decade before his son was born. The
book also said the elder Giuliani believed black people are
dark-skinned because God put them in ovens.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Giuliani died in 1981 at age 73 of prostate cancer, the
same disease that forced the mayor to drop his bid for a U.S.
Senate this year against Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Giuliani said his father's past died with him
and that it had nothing to do with his job as mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ''He taught me enormously important lessons, including the
lesson of being honest, which I've practiced all my life,''
Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett's book claims that while the mayor has boasted about
graduating from Manhattan College ''magna cum laude,'' he actually
graduated with lower honors, and even received a ''C'' in calculus,
according to the segments released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Livermore, Giuliani's girlfriend during college, is quoted
in the book saying that at times, the future mayor had a bad
temper.
</P>
<P>
   She recounts one instance when her former steady slugged someone
in her defense. ''The guy either said something, or made a remark
or whistled and Rudy just turned right around and punched him. His
friends pulled him off the guy. They said, 'Don't do that, what's
the matter with you?'''
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time - in the early 60s, according to the book
- Giuliani's father engaged in a gunfight on a Brighton Beach
street. The target was a mobster, the motive a loan sharking
dispute, a witness is quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett said the witness was a friend of Lewis D'Avanzo,
identified as the brother of a loanshark and that the two brothers
and the witness had gone looking for a rival along with Harold
Giuliani. When the rival was found, Giuliani shouted at him, the
other loanshark turned and shot at Giuliani's car and the mayor's
father and one of the men with him opened fire.
</P>
<P>
   There were apparently no injuries.
</P>
<P>
   A cousin of Giuliani's, Ralph Stanchi Jr., was not so lucky.
Barrett writes that Stanchi was a mob associate who specialized in
stolen vehicles, and that FBI documents link him to several
murders. He was killed by FBI agents in Brooklyn in 1977. At that
time Rudolph Giuliani was an assistant U.S. attorney in Manhattan
and had not seen the cousin since they were in grade school
together.
</P>
<P>
   Another Giuliani cousin, Joan Ellen D'Avanzo, who was raised in
the same house as Giuliani, became a junkie and was beaten to death
in 1973, according to the book.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, according to a friend of Harold Giuliani, the mayor's
father was ''disturbed by colored people'' and had devised his own
racial theories.
</P>
<P>
   ''God said the colored were not mature,'' Lina Merli told
Barrett. ''So God put them in the oven to make them mature. But
God, he forgot to take them out, so colored people came out
black.''

<HEADLINE> Ocean liner in fender bender with two military ships  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - The world-renowned ocean liner Queen Elizabeth
II was in a minor Hudson River fender-bender with two military
ships as it tried to enter a Manhattan slip Wednesday morning, the
Coast Guard said.
</P>
<P>
   One day after all three crafts participated in Operation Sail
2000, the QE2 accidentally bumped the Japanese warship Kashima,
which in turn banged into the British warship H.M.S. Manchester,
said Coast Guard spokesman Tony Riordan.
</P>
<P>
   The QE2 was entering its docking place at the passenger terminal
on Manhattan's West Side when the accident occurred, Riordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Good, a spokesman for Cunard Line Ltd., which owns the
famous ship, said one of the stern tugs was pulled away from the
QE2 by a strong current, and the other was unable to hold the ship
on course.
</P>
<P>
   The damage was minimal: scraped paint on the Kashima, scrapes
and a damaged railing on the QE2, scrapes and some bent metal on
the Manchester.
</P>
<P>
   Good said the QE2's captain, Paul Wright, boarded the Kashima
for a look after he finished docking.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was an admiral on board who said, 'Not to worry.' They
felt that it was an honor to be kissed by the queen,'' Good said.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries were reported in the accident, which remained under
Coast Guard investigation. The two warships were moored when the
small-scale crash occurred.

<HEADLINE> Mayor, chancellor meet on first day of summer school  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - On the first day of summer school for more than
200,000 children who fell behind during the regular school year,
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Schools Chancellor Harold Levy appeared
together publicly for the first time Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   They appeared intent on healing their rift.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who had once vehemently opposed Levy's appointment to
the top schools post, credited him with trying to turn around a
system beset by poor test scores, crowded classrooms and labor
troubles.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, 319,000 students - almost one-third of the
district's 1.1 million students - have been either required or
encouraged to enroll in summer courses because of failing or
marginal performance.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an attempt to try to turn the system into one with
much, much higher standards,'' Giuliani said at a news conference
in the library of a Washington Heights elementary school, P.S. 48.
''It won't be easy, but I think the chancellor and the Board of
Education are moving in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Levy, standing by the mayor's side, returned the kind words. He
credited Giuliani with pushing to end so-called social promotion
and said the school system can be vastly improved.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mayor, with your support, I think we can do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the men - both of whom enjoy the glare of media attention
and of having the final word - also affected the over-polite
manners of people still sizing one another up.
</P>
<P>
   Several times, the two awkwardly deferred to each other, and
when asked whether they had met privately to discuss educational
issues and how they were getting along, they politely declined to
answer.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Giuliani half-kiddingly told Levy, ''Don't answer
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, when Levy left the room and the mayor had center stage,
Giuliani acknowledged that the two disagreed on the issue of merit
pay - a proposal bitterly opposed by teachers but insisted upon by
the Giuliani administration during the current labor contract
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   After being pressed about his relationship with Levy, Giuliani
answered circumspectly, saying, ''I think we have a very
constructive relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   How the two men get along is being closely watched because
Giuliani has had a hand in forcing out the last two schools
chancellors. He also tried to derail Levy's ascendance to
chancellor by challenging both the lawyer's educational
qualifications, and business ties to a Board of Education member
who backed him.
</P>
<P>
   When it became clear that the Board of Education would approve
Levy despite Giuliani's objections, the mayor instructed his
appointees and allies on the board to back Levy. The board did so
unanimously in May.

<HEADLINE> Yankees 12, Orioles 6  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Andy Pettitte took a shutout into the seventh
inning, and Scott Brosius had four RBIs as the New York Yankees
avoided their longest home losing streak in 11 years with a 12-6
win over the Baltimore Orioles on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius hit a three-run homer in the second and an RBI single in
a six-run sixth inning as New York broke out to a 10-0 lead. Derek
Jeter added a solo shot for the Yankees, who had lost five straight
at home. New York hadn't lost six straight games at Yankee Stadium
since Aug. 24-29, 1989.
</P>
<P>
   With the Yankees' starting rotation in disarray, Pettitte (9-4)
has been solid of late. The left-hander, coming off a six-hit
shutout against Detroit, was just as tough for six innings before
allowing four runs in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte got out of trouble twice early, getting Albert Belle to
hit into a double play with runners on first and third and one out
in the first, and striking out Brady Anderson with runners on
second and third to end the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte's 15-inning scoreless streak was snapped in the seventh
inning when Charles Johnson hit his career-high 20th homer, a
two-run shot. He left with two runners on and the Orioles scored
four more runs after Jason Grimsley entered.
</P>
<P>
   With rookie Ed Yarnall slated to be called up to pitch Thursday
and manager Joe Torre searching for a starter Saturday against the
Mets, Pettitte's performance was needed.
</P>
<P>
   This marked just the 16th time in 41 games that a Yankees
starter pitched into the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Rapp (5-6) wasn't nearly as effective. He allowed seven runs
and six hits in 5 1-3 innings, and is winless in five career
decisions against the Yankees. The right-hander was hurt by a blown
call by first-base umpire Gary Cederstrom in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams, who has a 15-game hitting streak, led off with
a double and scored on Tino Martinez's one-out single that appeared
to bounce just foul down the right-field line.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius and Jose Vizcaino added RBI singles, Jeter had a
run-scoring groundout and Paul O'Neill hit a two-run double off
former-Yankee Darren Holmes to make it 10-0.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius' eighth homer gave New York a 3-0 lead and Jeter, in a
2-for-19 slump, hit his eighth homer in the fifth. Jeter, along
with teammates Jorge Posada and Mariano Rivera, were picked by
Torre for the AL All-Star team earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Felix Jose had a two-run single in the eighth for New York.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Jeter also made a tough play in the field, ranging deep
into the hole to field a grounder by Mark Lewis in the fifth and
get the force at second. ... The bottom of the sixth and top of the
seventh innings took 58 minutes to play. ... Orioles 2B Delino
DeShields sat out his third straight game with a strained muscle in
his right upper back. ... Yankees LF Shane Spencer did not start
after banging his right knee against the wall Tuesday. David
Justice, making his first start in left field for New York,
misplayed B.J. Surhoff's RBI double in the seventh. Justice went
1-for-4 and is 2-for-18 since being traded from Cleveland last
week. ... The Orioles had no plans to deal RHP Scott Erickson
before a midnight deadline gave him the right to veto any trade.
The Yankees are one of the teams that expressed interest in
Erickson.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Military Declares Exclusion Zone  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL ALEXANDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Fiji's military stepped up the pressure on
rebels holding 27 hostages in Parliament, closing off access to the
area Thursday and giving two days for scores of rebel supporters to
leave the complex in return for amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   Officials insisted the declaration of a military exclusion zone
around the parliament complex was not a prelude to an operation to
free the hostages -- who include the former prime minister and
members of his government. But they expressed frustration with the
standoff that has dragged on for 47 days.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not the first step toward a military option,'' Lt.
Col. Filipo Tarakinikini said at a news conference. ''This is just
a step to try to resolve a situation that has gone on too long.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the military still hoped for a peaceful conclusion to
the crisis, but was not willing to let rebel leader George Speight
''dictate'' its actions and that more drastic measures have not
been ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   ''There might have to be a price to be paid and we are willing
to pay it for the sake of the nation,'' Tarakinikini said.
</P>
<P>
   Speight, who claims he has popular support for his goal of
giving priority to the rights of indigenous Fijians over those of
the ethnic Indian minority, has warned that the hostages could be
harmed if the military halts access to the compound or cuts off
utilities, as Tarakinikini said was a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ''It must be impressed upon the military that the blockade of
supplies will have direct implications on the security and the life
of the people who are under our care,'' Speight spokesman Jo Nata
said by telephone from inside the complex to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Under a drenching rain, soldiers manning the exclusive zone
seemed fairly relaxed as midnight passed and the zone order took
effect in the early hours Thursday. Under the orders, entry to the
complex is barred except to food supplies. Until now, supporters of
the rebels had been allowed in and out of the parliament complex
with little impediment, and Speight also left and re-entered
several times.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel spokesman Nata claimed up to 3,000 supporters were in and
around the compound -- a figure that appeared somewhat inflated. He
said rebels would tell all the supporters that they were free to
leave. ''But I am confident that none will leave,'' Nata said.
</P>
<P>
   Speight supporters occupied the airport at Labasa, on the
northern island of Vanua Levu, for two hours Thursday morning
before leaving peacefully, a control tower official said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was pretty calm,'' he told The Associated Press by
telephone. ''They apparently wanted to give some backing to Speight
and those who were involved in the thing at the military base.''
</P>
<P>
   Two soldiers seized weapons from the base at Labasa on Tuesday
before returning them a day later. Tarakinikini blamed local chiefs
for instigating that incident and said they were capable of more
''disturbances.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a drenching rain, soldiers manning the numerous
checkpoints on the streets around Parliament seemed fairly relaxed
as the exclusion zone order took effect at midnight Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Commodore Frank Bainimarama, who assumed power 10 days after the
coup, has been reluctant to take strong action as long as the
hostages were not harmed.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the military support the rebel's objective of ensuring
that the rights of indigenous Fijians come first. Some members of
the crack Counter-Revolutionary Warfare unit have been among those
guarding the compound since it was stormed on May 19 and the
government of Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry -- the first Fijian
of Indian ancestry to lead the country -- was taken hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Indians generally have prospered since they were brought to Fiji
more than a century ago by English colonialists seeking indentured
laborers for rich sugar cane fields. They make up 44 percent of the
population, and have become dominant in commerce and now politics,
sparking resentment among the 51 percent indigenous Fijians.

<HEADLINE> Union, Teachers Closer on Agreement  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- The nation's largest teachers' union took a step
closer Wednesday to ending its a century-old resistance to paying
teachers for performance, instead of just seniority. But the union
refused to embrace a proposal to base pay on how well students
perform on tests.
</P>
<P>
   The National Education Association, in crafting changes to its
bargaining policy, signaled that it would no longer stand in the
way of union locals that pursue a ''bonus'' pay approach or have
one imposed upon them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the NEA did not endorse such a change as national policy
and specifically said no compensation package should replace pay
based on seniority, nor subject a teacher to the whims of a
principal in determining compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will continue to oppose merit pay based upon subjective
evaluations,'' said NEA President Bob Chase, who has been both
praised and vilified for stressing a ''new unionism'' that urges
collaboration with management on improving schools.
</P>
<P>
   While Chase said no assistance would be provided by the national
union to locals who initiate such plans, he added ''We do not have
a prohibition. They are free agents.''
</P>
<P>
   During hours of emotional debate, some teachers bitterly opposed
the changes, arguing it will be the beginning of the end for a
pay-for-seniority policy that dates back to the 1920s, the earliest
years of the public education system. The opponents argued bonuses
based on student performance or a boss' judgment are divisive and
unfair to teachers with the most-troubled students.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who will want to teach the poor students? the students who
don't speak English as well?'' said Barbara Kerr, a member of the
California Teachers Association. ''This makes us vulnerable to the
growing attacks by districts, school boards and our enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   Edithe Fulton, vice president of the New Jersey Education
Association, who has taught elementary school for 34 years, said
the policy undermines attempts by union locals to bargain with
school boards.
</P>
<P>
   ''School boards can look across the table and say look what your
national organization has done,'' she complained.
</P>
<P>
   The new NEA policy was adopted on voice vote by the 10,000
delegates attending the conference.
</P>
<P>
   While it does not endorse replacing seniority scales with any
system of bonus pay, the resolution says the national organization
will give technical assistance to a local that has ''bonus'' plans
imposed on them by legislatures or school boards. A local would not
be kept from imposing such a plan on itself as part of bargaining
with school boards.
</P>
<P>
   Union members, who supported the policy change, said the shift
toward some form of bonus pay structure was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ''We could no longer engage in the culture of refusal,'' said
Andrea Giunta, an elementary school teacher who leads the Denver
affiliate of the NEA. ''Teachers are terribly underpaid. People are
seeking any way teacher compensation can be improved.''
</P>
<P>
   She said it is better to have teachers involved in crafting the
plans instead of fighting them.
</P>
<P>
   Teacher cash incentives have grown in popularity around the
country as business leaders and politicians frequently call for
higher standards in primary education. Various incentive plans have
been proposed in New York City and in California, giving teachers
higher salaries or bonuses for performance.
</P>
<P>
   Some shift toward performance incentives has been proposed by
both Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore as they
complete for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The American Federation of Teachers, a smaller union with 1
million members that was meeting in Philadelphia, has not made a
decision on the issue. AFT president Sandra Feldman said her group
is studying the pay-for-performance issue.

Israeli Parties Vow To Leave Govt.
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Two parties in Ehud Barak's ruling coalition Wednesday said
they would leave his government ahead of a U.S.-hosted peace summit, possibly
depriving the prime minister of the broad consensus he says he needs to make
peace. Natan Sharansky's immigrants party and the National Religious Party
indicated that they cannot remain in government with Barak appearing ready to
make land concessions to the Palestinians that are too broad. Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will meet in a summit with President Clinton in
the United States next week to try to reach a peace accord.

NH Justice's Impeachment Recommended

   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Lawmakers recommended impeaching the state's highest
judge today, saying he lied under oath to hinder their investigation of the
Supreme Court. After six hours of debate, the House Judiciary Committee voted
that there was enough evidence that Chief Justice David Brock may have perjured
himself to warrant sending the matter to the Senate for trial. ''There seems to
be a pattern here of deception. It may be over small things, but some of these
small things contributed to obstruction of justice,'' said Rep. Benjamin
DePecol.

spoke to a convention of the American Federation of Teachers, but focused more

Audit: Taxpayers Overpaid $25M
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thousands of taxpayers overpaid $25 million in income
taxes that should have been credited to their accounts or refunded by the
Internal Revenue Service, according to an independent audit that cites computer
problems as the main culprit. Thousands more individuals, families and
businesses forfeited their rights to refunds or credits, or were at risk of
doing so, that totaled $335 million. These taxpayers failed to file late tax
returns in time for legal deadlines to qualify for the money. The IRS says it
has returned or credited the money owed.

clips were shown shortly before Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, was to
receive one of Cuba's top civilian awards for his fight to bring his son Elian

<P>
   BHUBANESHWAR, India (AP) -- Limping and gasping for breath, 10 sick Royal
Bengal tigers -- including seven rare white tigers -- died one by one at an
Indian zoo despite being injected with antibiotics, officials said Wednesday.
The Nandankanan Zoo houses India's largest collection of Royal Bengal tigers and
the world's largest collection of white tigers. Preliminary autopsies indicated
all the tigers died of the same disease -- sleeping sickness, or
trypanosomiasis, an illness spread by tsetse flies -- despite antibiotics, said
S.K. Patnaik, chief wildlife warden at the zoo.

   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Robin Threatt scored a season-high 24 points
as the Seattle Storm ended a nine-game losing streak by beating the
Minnesota Lynx 67-60 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion Storm (3-13) held the Lynx to 39.3 percent
shooting from the field and their second-lowest point total of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Threatt, who scored 22 points in a 81-60 loss to Utah on
Saturday, scored six points in a 12-0 run early in the second half
that put Seattle in control.
</P>
<P>
   The Lynx (10-6), who had won four of five and were unbeaten
against expansion teams, trailed by as many as 17 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Lynx defeated the Storm 65-53 last week, Seattle's worst
loss during its nine-game skid.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle led by only 30-29 at the break, but held Minnesota to
just two baskets in the first 12:11 of the second half.

   Kristin Folkl and Keitha Dickerson led Minnesota with 15 points
apiece.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Canada Law Allows Spanking of Kids  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Parents and teachers can spank children under
Canadian law, but the issue should be reviewed because public
attitudes have changed, a judge ruled Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Ontario Superior Court Judge David McCombs
rejected a challenge by child advocacy groups of the law that they
said violated the constitutional rights of children.
</P>
<P>
   Section 43 of the Criminal Code says ''every school teacher,
parent or person standing in place of a parent is justified in
using force by way of correction ... if force does not exceed what
is reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   McCombs upheld the law, saying he did not believe it infringed
on children's rights. But, he added, it may be time to review the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The evidence shows that public attitudes toward corporal
punishment of children are changing,'' McCombs said in his written
decision. ''There is a growing body of evidence that even mild
forms of corporal punishment do no good and may cause harm.''
</P>
<P>
   A public opinion poll released in December found most Canadians
opposed making spanking a criminal offense.
</P>
<P>
   Children's rights advocates say the law offers a defense for
teachers, parents and babysitters charged with assaulting
youngsters, and has been used to justify hitting children and
teen-agers with belts, electrical cords and plastic rulers.
</P>
<P>
   But Barbara Sargent, president of the Ontario Teachers
Federation, defended the so-called spanking law as a critical tool
for educators.
</P>
<P>
   ''What section 43 did and will continue to do is enable teachers
to maintain some kind of discipline and balance in the classroom,''
Sargent said Wednesday. ''Teachers will be able to maintain
discipline in a fair and judicial way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian Foundation for Children, Youth and Law argued the
law violates the Charter of Rights and Freedom by making children
the only group of citizens that can be legally assaulted for
reasons other than self-defense or protecting others.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Canada's attorney general said parents should be
allowed to discipline children without facing criminal charges. In
its court brief, however, the federal government said it agreed
that other forms of discipline should be encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, individual states determine laws regarding
corporal punishment and several states have prohibited allowing
spankings.

<HEADLINE> Female Bishops Topic in AME Meeting  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NOLAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Even though women outnumber men 3 to 1 in the
African Methodist Episcopal Church, the denomination has never had
a female bishop in its 213-year history.
</P>
<P>
   But as AME's 46th general conference began Wednesday, officials
said there could be enough support this year to get one of the two
female candidates elected as one of the church's 19 bishops.
Elections for the 2.5 million-member denomination will be held
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Wouldn't it be great if we could get one?'' said Delores
Williams, 51, a delegate from Panama City, Fla. ''Whoever she is,
I'm for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Delegates to the weeklong conference gave Vice President Al Gore
a warm reception Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In a 40-minute speech, Gore emphasized education and health care
but also touched on many traditional Democratic issues -- gun
controls, the minimum wage and free, universal pre-school.
</P>
<P>
   He told the delegates that the Clinton administration deserved
credit for raising incomes in black households and that they could
keep the nation ''on the right track'' by helping elect him.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have made good progress, but you ain't seen nothin' yet,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore asked delegates to ''join with me'' in his quest for the
presidency and received a standing ovation, with the band striking
up the hymn ''Victory Is Mine'' as he left the podium.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he lifted up some excellent points,'' said T.R.
Goyins, a delegate from Roselle, N.J. ''He hit on things that are
going to feed the inner soul.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Carolyn Tyler Guidry, who supervises 19 AME churches in
Los Angeles, and the Rev. Vashti M. McKenzie, pastor of a church in
Baltimore, are among 41 candidates for two bishop positions vacated
by retirement. Guidry stood for election as bishop in 1996;
McKenzie is making her first run.
</P>
<P>
   ''We let the men lead the household and the church,'' said Doris
Hamilton, 57, a delegate from Atlanta. ''But it's a new century,
and things are changing.''
</P>
<P>
   Several organizations within the AME Church have urged election
of a female bishop. The United Methodist Church and the Episcopal
Church have had female bishops for years.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in Philadelphia in 1787, the AME Church has members in
the United States, Africa, Canada, England and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   The AME general conference meets every four years and governs
the denomination.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the AME's 19 districts is led by a bishop, who also
serve on a leadership council for the denomination. A majority of
the 1,800 delegates is required to elect a bishop.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Parties Clash After Election  </HEADLINE>
By JULIE WATSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHIMALHUACAN, Mexico (AP) -- Three days after the electoral upset
of Mexico's ruling party, its loyalists clashed with opposition
activists in several cities Wednesday in rock-throwing skirmishes
that left a dozen people injured.
</P>
<P>
   Buses also were burned in several clashes in Mexico state, which
surrounds Mexico City, after opposition groups accused the ruling
party of electoral fraud as ballots were being re-counted in local
races.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've always done this (fraud) here, but now the people are
tired,'' said Felipe Castillo Rocha, an electrician and opposition
activist punched in the jaw during a clash in the suburb of
Chimalhuacan.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rest of Mexico voted for a change, and we want to be part
of it, too. We're not going to let them get away with this.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear who started the fighting, which began amid a show
of force by local supporters of the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which lost the presidency for the
first time in 71 years Sunday but hung on to some local
governments.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the day, about 1,000 PRI supporters gathered outside
buildings in several cities where electoral officials were carrying
out a ballot re-count expected to conclude Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We won legitimately, and for those who have their doubts, the
proof that the people voted for the PRI is this concentration of
people here today,'' said Jesus Tolentino, the PRI candidate for
mayor of Chimalhuacan, as he stood atop a pickup truck in the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although on a national level the PRI lost, we here in
Chimalhuacan haven't lost the faith.''
</P>
<P>
   The PRI, which is struggling to re-group and survive after
Sunday's crushing defeat at the polls, apparently held on to the
Chimalhuacan mayorship, according to preliminary results.
</P>
<P>
   Other skirmishes broke out in the northern Mexico City suburb of
Ecatepec and in the city of Ixtlahuaca.

<HEADLINE> Dallas trustees fire Superintendent Bill Rojas  </HEADLINE>
By KELLIE B. GORMLY
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) - The Dallas school trustees decided Wednesday to
fire Superintendent Bill Rojas, ending the tenure of the fourth
district leader in five years and multiple disputes that have
erupted since Rojas began work in August.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the superintendent's offer last week to resign,
the board invoked the ''good rapport'' clause, citing poor
communication between Rojas and the board members.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas, who grew up in the South Bronx, spent most of his 31-year
educational career in New York City school system. School officials
in New York have described him as sometimes forceful and outspoken
but very devoted to children.
</P>
<P>
   By firing Rojas, the district pays him $90,000 in severance pay.
Accepting his resignation could have cost the district $520,000 in
pay for the remainder of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas was hired as the fourth chief in five years and replaced
Yvonne Gonzalez, who was sentenced to federal prison for embezzling
$16,000 in district funds. He was reportedly the nation's
highest-paid superintendent, earning a base salary of $260,000.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to school board president Roxan Staff last week,
Rojas wrote that the trustees tried to ''micromanage'' him and that
his relationships with many of them are beyond repair. He said he
hopes his resignation will end the power struggles and enable the
board to focus on improving education.
</P>
<P>
   The board has voted longtime educator Robert Payton to act as
interim superintendent effective immediately. Payton, who has
worked for the district 35 years, was in charge of the city's nine
sub-districts.
</P>
<P>
   Staff said the board hopes to have a permanent superintendent
named by the end of August.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of two Dallas business groups have urged board
members to hire a permanent replacement within 30 days, because
they said an interim superintendent would only trigger more chaos
within the district.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders from the Greater Dallas Chamber of Commerce and the
Dallas Citizens Council Tuesday urged the board to choose the
replacement with the assistance of a three-person advisory
committee and to accept Rojas' resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, members of the local chapter of LULAC - League of
United Latin American Citizens - are calling on the Texas Education
Agency to take over the Dallas schools, which have a Hispanic
student population of about 54 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although LULAC does not support Rojas, the group assigns equal
blame to the trustees for the district's problems, said Jesse Diaz,
president of Council 4496. At least five or six of the trustees
should be removed because they are ''dysfunctional'' and simply
cannot get along with each other, Diaz said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a cancer on the school board,'' he said. ''The only
way we're going to get rid of it is to remove it.''
</P>
<P>
   School and community leaders hoped by hiring Rojas, who is of
Puerto Rican descent, he would bring the same success to Dallas
that he had working with minority groups in San Francisco. Rojas
was credited for raising the test scores of blacks and Hispanics
during his seven-year tenure as superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   Trustees have been at odds with Rojas for months over a lack of
communication and their worries about the possibility of excessive
spending in the next budget, including the hiring of the for-profit
Edison Schools Inc. to run several schools.
</P>
<P>
   Some trustees claim Rojas' spending commitments have created an
estimated $52 million shortfall in the district budget.

<HEADLINE> Gov. Signs Teacher Incentive Bills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- In a bid to draw teachers to
California and keep them, Gov. Gray Davis on Wednesday approved
more than $2.4 billion in educational incentives, including higher
starting pay and better benefits for teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The changes are aimed at improving student performance and
easing California's teacher shortage.
</P>
<P>
   Minimum starting salaries will rise from $32,000 to $34,000,
and, teachers who have at least four years experience at public or
private schools will get a new tax credit of $250 to $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now it can truly be said that California values teachers and
it can truly be said that if you want to teach, teach in
California,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   The state expects to need 300,000 additional teachers over the
next decade.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also signed a bill adding $100 million for a
program that gives up to $25,000 to teachers whose students meet
higher goals on the state achievement test. And he approved
cost-of-living increases and bonuses of up to $20,000 for teachers
who agree to work at low-performing schools.
</P>
<P>
   Davis initially sought to exempt teachers from California's
income tax, but lawmakers rejected that idea.

<HEADLINE> Trade Deal Between Caribbean, Cuba  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN McNAMARA
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANOUAN, St. Vincent (AP) -- In a sign of warming relations with
Cuba, Caribbean leaders signed an agreement Wednesday promising
freer markets and closer cooperation on tourism projects with the
communist island.
</P>
<P>
   The pact -- heralded by Fidel Castro in a written statement as
part of a ''path toward higher achievement'' -- also shows a growing
willingness to defy the United States, which for decades fought to
curb Cuba's influence in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will keep on fighting until the (U.S.) policy of blockade,
the economic warfare, the subversion, the destabilization and the
slander against Cuba have ceased,'' Castro said in the statement
read by Cuban External Trade Minister Ricardo Cabrisas.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement with the 15-member Caribbean Community, or
Caricom, was signed at a meeting of leaders in St. Vincent and the
Grenadines.
</P>
<P>
   It comes a week after President Clinton said he is inclined to
sign legislation easing the 38-year-old embargo on Cuba by allowing
Havana to buy U.S. food and medicine on strict terms.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders did not immediately provide copies of the agreement, but
Alister McIntyre, deputy negotiator for Caricom, said it would
allow smaller islands to export goods to Cuba duty-free while
continuing to tax Cuban items.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also calls for countries to develop joint tourism
marketing packages like one Cuba has with Jamaica. Resorts in the
two countries plan to advertise a joint ''Reggae-Salsa Holiday''
travel package to Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   Caribbean leaders said they see the agreement as another step in
undermining the U.S. embargo and bringing the once-isolated nation
into the world market.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.S. has run out of excuses,'' Dominica's Prime Minister
Rosie Douglas said. ''There is no argument they can make to leave
Cuba out in the cold. Cuba is part of the Caribbean.''
</P>
<P>
   Caribbean islands had followed the lead of the United States in
shunning Cuba after Castro's 1959 revolution.
</P>
<P>
   A partial reprieve came in 1972, when Caricom members Guyana,
Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados and Jamaica established diplomatic
relations with Havana. But it wasn't until 1997 that other islands
joined the rapprochement.
