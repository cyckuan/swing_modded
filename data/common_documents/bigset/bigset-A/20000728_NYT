SAN FRANCISCO NEWSPAPER CAN BE SOLD, JUDGE RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal judge in San Francisco ruled Thursday that the Hearst
Corp.'s $660 million purchase of The San Francisco Chronicle did
not violate antitrust laws and that the company would have had
legal justification for closing The San Francisco Examiner had it
chosen to.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle has been a fierce journalistic rival of The
Examiner, the newspaper that gave William Randolph Hearst his start
in publishing, for more than a century. The two newspapers have
also been business partners for the past 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, Judge Vaughn Walker noted that The Examiner's
financial condition was so weak that it ``imposes a substantial
drain on the profitability'' of the newspaper agency whose profits
were shared by both. The Chronicle's circulation of 464,943 is more
than four times that of The Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Since the closing of The Examiner would have been economically
justified, its subsidized sale to the politically influential Fang
family in San Francisco was laced with what Walker called
``malodorous aspects,'' in reference to the complicated political
and legal dance behind the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, Hearst agreed to sell the newspaper to the family's
business, ExIm, and give it a subsidy of up to $66 million for
three years to help keep a truncated version of the newspaper
alive.
</P>
<P>
   Walker's decision, if it survives possible appeals, paves the
way for Hearst to act on its plans to merge the newsrooms of the
two newspapers and begin renewed competition with its rivals in the
San Francisco Bay area. The most prominent of these rivals, The San
Jose Mercury News, which is owned by Knight Ridder, this week began
delivering a special San Francisco edition, firing the first shot
in the latest battle for readers in one of the country's wealthiest
areas.

OLCOTT D. SMITH, 93, CHAIRMAN OF AETNA AND A HARTFORD LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
   By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Olcott Damon Smith, who as chairman of Aetna Life &AMP; Casualty led
the formation of its international and financial services
divisions, died July 24 in Avon, Conn. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   The two businesses that Smith believed would bode so well for
Aetna's future are to be sold to ING Group NV under the terms of a
$5 billion deal reached earlier this month. The company announced
plans in March to break itself into two parts, one for its medical
coverage and the other for financial services, which include real
estate development, commercial finance and mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   A 1929 graduate of Yale University, Smith joined the Hartford
law firm of Day, Berry &AMP; Howard after graduating from Harvard Law
School in 1932 and was made a partner in 1936. He represented banks
and utility companies in financing, rate changes and merger
activities during his 30 years with the firm. Day, Berry &AMP; Howard
also performed much of Aetna's outside legal work.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who enjoyed a tough game of tennis, was an Aetna director
for nine years before the board selected him in 1963 to succeed its
retiring chairman, Henry Beers. At Aetna, Smith was credited with
contributions that ranged from recruiting more directors from
outside the Hartford area to instituting a system that emphasized
cost effectiveness and accountability.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1968 interview, Smith said the puzzle facing companies like
Aetna could be summed up as, ``How can you engage in a business
that is a social necessity and still make a reasonable profit?'' He
was in favor of no-fault insurance, then a rarity, and Aetna was
one of the first insurers to offer individual variable annuities.
He criticized the conservative investment strategy that
characterized most insurers, saying it ``has had too strong an
influence on other areas of the business.''
</P>
<P>
   While looking outward to improve Aetna, Smith was also concerned
with strengthening Hartford, one of the Northeast's poorer cities.
He led the effort to establish the Hartford Civic Center, which
opened in 1975. He headed the Town Meeting for Tomorrow, a 1964
conference on Hartford's future, and was a chairman of the Greater
Hartford Process, a program to improve quality of life for blacks
and minorities. In 1939, he represented his hometown, West
Hartford, in the Connecticut legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was a recipient of the American Jewish Committee's
Leadership Award in 1968. He also won the National Human Relations
Award from the National Conference of Christians and Jews in 1971,
and was a Benjamin Franklin Fellow at the Royal Society of Arts in
London.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he was a trustee of many Hartford area
institutions, including the Wadsworth Atheneum, the Farmington
Public Library and the Connecticut Children's Aid Society. Through
Aetna, he brought World Cup Tennis to Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   His first wife, Lucy Bulkeley Brainerd, died in 1983. He is
survived by his wife, Catharine Carton Swett, whom he married later
that year; four children, Damon B. Smith and Wendy M. Brainerd, of
New York; Tyler Smith, of Hartford; and O. Whitman Smith, of North
Ferrisbury, Va.; 14 grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.

MEN'S HEALTH MAGAZINE, TRYING TO WIN YOUTH BACK, NAMES EDITOR 
</HEADLINE>
   By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Men's Health magazine, the onetime upstart that rocketed to the
top of the men's magazine world during the 1990s before stalling,
is turning to a 30-year-old editor to help it win younger readers
from surging competitors like Maxim.
</P>
<P>
   David Zinczenko, who has spent the last two years in Europe
tending to the growth of some of the magazine's 21 foreign
offshoots, was named editor in chief of the U.S. edition Thursday
by Steven Murphy, president and chief operating officer of Rodale,
Inc., which owns Men's Health.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Men's Health has a circulation of 1.6
million, but the number of advertising pages has declined in the
last year, according to Cory Shield, a spokesman for Rodale, which
is based in Emmaus, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of Zinczenko is the second top-level management
change at Men's Health since Murphy joined Rodale from Walt Disney
Co.'s Disney Publishing Worldwide, where he was managing director,
three months ago. A week ago, Paul J. Turcotte was appointed vice
president and publisher of the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge for Men's Health, Murphy said Thursday was
``the temporary advertising love affair with the lad magazines'' _
a British slang term for magazines like Loaded, Maxim and FHM,
newer entries in a field that Men's Health helped create when it
was started in newsletter form in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what changes he would make in Men's Health, Zinczenko said
Thursday: ``The magazine's pretty buff already. There's no reason
to go into wholesale changes. I do want to bring in fresh voices,
fresh points of view.'' Murphy, in a separate interview, said,
``David's Rolodex of writers includes a new generation _ folks who,
10 years from now, will be names.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's focus, Murphy added, would continue to be on
health, fitness, sex and relationships, with an added emphasis on
personal finance.

GUNMAN HOLDS PILOTS HOSTAGE AT KENNEDY; PASSENGERS FREED
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Nev.)  By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A man armed with a handgun rushed onto a National
Airlines jet at Kennedy International Airport Thursday night and
took the pilot and co-pilot hostage, a spokesman for the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey said.
</P>
<P>
   All the passengers on the plane were released unharmed, said
Greg Trevor, the Port Authority spokesman. One passenger described
a scene of pandemonium.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 11 p.m., the gunman rushed the cockpit of the
National Airlines Flight 19, a Boeing 757 that was scheduled to
take off at 9:30 p.m., bound for Las Vegas, Trevor said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how the man got the gun through airport
security, Trevor said. ``That's a very good question,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was at the airport's Terminal 4, at Gate 33, the Port
Authority said. No injuries were immediately reported.
</P>
<P>
   A man who answered the phone at National Airlines' toll-free
reservation number said, ``We have no comment and no numbers for
you to call,'' then hung up.
</P>
<P>
   Misty Nichols, a passenger on the flight, said that the plane
was supposed to leave at 9:30 p.m., but that she boarded after 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat down, got buckled up and the next thing I know everybody
was screaming,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, people started rushing to get off the plane, she said, and
that a little girl got trampled in the rush.
</P>
<P>
   She later tried to retrieve some of her belongings, but someone
yelled, ``Get off the plane _ your life is more important than your
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   National, formed a year ago and based in Las Vegas, is a small
airline, with a fleet of 11 Boeing 757-200s providing nonstop
service from Las Vegas to eight other cities. But it is growing
fast. It began turning a profit in March, after only 10 months in
the air, becoming one of the fastest new airlines in history to
make money, according to Aviation Daily.
</P>
<P>
   National runs four flights a day from Kennedy Airport to Las
Vegas.

MORE POLICE OFFICERS BEING PUNISHED, BUT NOT MORE SEVERELY
</HEADLINE>
  By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Since federal authorities began reviewing the police
disciplinary process three years ago, the Police Department has
punished many more officers for a wide range of misconduct,
according to police statistics.
</P>
<P>
   From 1997 through 1999, the number of officers who received
serious formal punishments _ firings, suspensions without pay and
forfeited vacation days for infractions ranging from rule
violations to excessive force _ has increased by 28 percent, to 450
from 352, according to the statistics.
</P>
<P>
   But while the statistics and a separate analysis by Mark Green,
the public advocate, show that the overall number of officers being
disciplined by the department has increased, the severity of
punishments has not, and in fact has dipped in some instances.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the number of officers fired dropped to 88 in 1999
from 116 in 1997, and the average number of days forfeited in cases
in which disciplinary charges were brought declined to 24.8 last
year from 30.1 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in the number of punished officers comes as the
department is facing the prospect of a federal monitor or a lawsuit
to install one by federal prosecutors. A three-year inquiry by the
office of the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, prompted by the 1997
station house torture of Abner Louima, found that the department
was so lenient with officers in excessive force cases that it had
bred a climate that failed to deter brutal acts.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials contend that the significant jump in the number
of officers subjected to formal discipline is a result of their
increased vigilance and efforts, over four years, to improve the
disciplinary process. Critics of the department say the increase is
a direct response to the federal investigation, and is an attempt
to head off the appointment of a federal monitor.
</P>
<P>
   But Police officials cite a 25 percent drop last year in the
number of legal claims filed against the city that alleged police
brutality and a drop in the number of complaints filed against
officers with the Civilian Complaint Review Board.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Kelleher, the department's first deputy commissioner,
disagreed with suggestions that the increased discipline was a
response to greater outside scrutiny of the department. ``You're
not going to reduce civilian complaints overnight,'' he said.
``This is the real world. You can't say, `OK, everybody be good.'
It took a lot of hard work, a lot of getting the message out. And
again, I think the proof is in the pudding.''
</P>
<P>
   The report by Green concluded that despite the recent increase
in the number of officers disciplined, the department's
disciplinary process was plagued by ``systemic failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on a review of cases of police misconduct substantiated
against 664 officers, Green said he found that 75 percent of the
officers disciplined received insignificant penalties that he
characterized as a ``slap on the wrist.'' Those punishments, he
said, consisted of discipline like a reprimand from a superior, a
note in an officer's file or the loss of a few vacation days.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we found is a Police Department that fights crime well,
but fights police misconduct far less well,'' said Green, who is
expected to run for mayor in 2001, at a news conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani dismissed Green's report, calling it
partisan and saying that it glossed over what the mayor
characterized as the department's significant achievements.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Kelleher said that the efforts of Commissioner
Howard Safir had raised the discipline rate and had helped send a
message to officers that misconduct would not be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the discipline is strong, I think its fair, I think
it's consistent,'' he said.

JAPANESE PLAYERS' ASPIRATIONS GO BEYOND TOKEN APPEARANCES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Masafumi Kawaguchi isn't trying to be an
ingrate.
</P>
<P>
   It's just that Kawaguchi _ one of two Japanese football players
to join the Cowboys yesterday as part of the pageantry of the
American Bowl exhibition game in Tokyo on Aug. 5 _ has bigger
dreams than being an honorary member of an NFL team.
</P>
<P>
   Kawaguchi, a 5-foot-11, 180-pound linebacker, played high school
football in San Clemente, Calif., before starring at college at
Ritsumeikan University in Japan. After playing the past four years
in NFL Europe with the Amsterdam Admirals, Kawaguchi is thirsting
for more.
</P>
<P>
   So while the NFL and the Cowboys are using the American Bowl
against the Atlanta Falcons as a public relations tool to market
the game and the league abroad, Kawaguchi, and receiver Masato Itai
hope to use their practice time with the Cowboys and the game to
prove they can play in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always dreamed of playing over here,'' said Kawaguchi,
who was introduced to the game as a child when his family lived in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my goal. I want to play in this league, not as a guest
like this. I'm here trying to make the team. I want to show what I
can do on special teams and as a linebacker.''
</P>
<P>
   Kawaguchi already has a role model of sorts in Cowboys
linebacker Dat Nguyen, the first Vietnamese-American to play in the
NFL. However, Kawaguchi didn't realize how big Nguyen (5-11, 231)
is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met him,'' Kawaguchi said. ``I didn't know he was that big.
They said he was small. But he is not small.''
</P>
<P>
   Itai, who learned the game in the college and corporate leagues
in Japan, is also a veteran of NFL Europe and the Admirals. He
became the first Japanese player to catch a touchdown pass in NFL
Europe when he caught a 12-yard scoring toss in Week 9 of the 2000
season.
</P>
<P>
   Itai said the technique and teaching in Japan is the same as the
NFL, but the size and speed of NFL players are a big difference.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Dave Campo and owner Jerry Jones welcomed both to
the team yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said they will get a chance to show what they can do,
though he pointed out that they have an uphill battle of achieving
their long-term dreams because they aren't on any team's
training-camp roster.
</P>
<P>
   Campo said it's unlikely the two players will play Sunday when
the Cowboys open the preseason against the Pittsburgh Steelers at
Texas Stadium. However, he said the coaching staff will diagram
plays and packages to best utilize Kawaguchi and Itai in the
American Bowl. \Nsubheds:Briefly Cowboys running back Emmitt Smith
(sprained toe) didn't practice for the second consecutive day.
However, the Cowboys have yet to rule him out of Sunday's preseason
game against Steelers. Tight end David LaFleur (strained groin) is
questionable for the Steelers game. Campo said the Cowboys, who are
1-9 the past two years in the preseason, will be looking to put on
a good show Sunday. He said the focus, though, will be on
evaluating players. Guard Tony Hutson, who has been limited in
practice after undergoing surgery in the off-season to repair a
torn anterior cruciate ligament, will not play against the
Steelers, offensive line coach Hudson Houck said. Former Haltom
High School offensive lineman Kelvin Garmon will start at left
guard in place of the injured Larry Allen (fractured hand), Houck
said.

EDITORIAL: NEW YORK FUND-RAISING TRICKERY 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, July 28:
</P>
<P>
   In spreading money around to New York state's 62 Republican
county committees this month, Rep. Rick Lazio has resorted to a
legal but unsavory campaign scheme long favored by the state's
political leaders. This ersatz philanthropy by a Senate candidate
is simply another fund-raising gimmick. It is a way candidates for
federal office can sidestep federal contribution limits in New
York. And Lazio's use of that dodge is the latest signal that the
state Legislature still needs to fix a campaign financing system
that is nothing short of a national embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   This particular ploy works when a candidate sets up a state
political action committee ostensibly to nurture grass-roots
campaigns and encourage local candidates. Under this state-approved
guise, a donor can write a much larger check than for a federal
campaign. An individual can contribute only $2,000 directly to
Lazio's Senate campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton, for
example. But state law allows that same individual to contribute an
additional $76,500 a year to Lazio's state PAC.
</P>
<P>
   The PAC money cannot be used directly for a candidate's
campaign, but a spokesman for Lazio said that the funds could be
used to set up local phone banks and get out voters for all the
party's candidates, including Lazio. Although the Lazio campaign
protests that this PAC is separate, Clifford Levy of The Times
reported this week that some donors contributed the maximum to
Lazio's Senate campaign at the same time they contributed thousands
more to his state PAC.
</P>
<P>
   The doling out of money to local parties is one of the quickest
ways for a politician to gain statewide strength and recognition,
either as a candidate or as a political rainmaker. Most recently in
New Jersey, for example, Jon Corzine, the multimillionaire
Democratic Senate candidate, spent tens of thousands of dollars of
his own money to enrich local Democratic committees around the
state. Local workers helped him thrash Jim Florio, the former
governor, in the party primary last month.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, Lazio's state PAC is not the only fund-raising
contrivance that deprives New York voters of a fair contest this
political season. Both the Lazio and Clinton campaigns are
benefiting from unregulated contributions, or ``soft money,'' spent
for them by national party committees. But Lazio's active PAC also
offers the latest evidence that New York's Legislature prefers
preserving tainted fund-raising habits for another election year.
Despite a few weak promises, legislators concluded their business
in Albany this summer without making a single improvement in the
worst state campaign finance system in the country.

CORNHUSKERS EYE NATIONAL TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A sheepish grin spread across the face of
Nebraska football coach Frank Solich yesterday as he feigned
confusion about a sudden reversal in the way elite teams are
judged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always heard that defense wins championships. But I'm not
hearing that this year, with all we have back on offense,'' said
Solich, whose squad has been pegged, along with Florida State, as
the co-favorites to win college football's national championship
for the 2000 season. ``It seems like all the hype about us has
completely reversed itself since last year.''
</P>
<P>
   With good reason. The Nebraska team that finished last year
ranked third in the final Associated Press poll got there with a
stifling defense and survived a school-record 49 fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   With six defensive starters lost to graduation, it's the offense
that produced 469 yards _ with just one turnover _ in a 31-21 romp
over Tennessee in the Fiesta Bowl that has caught the imagination
of preseason prognosticators. The Cornhuskers return nine offensive
starters, including quarterback Eric Crouch, the top two tailbacks
and four of five offensive linemen.
</P>
<P>
   Even with last year's turnover problems, Nebraska averaged 34.3
points per game. That has proved to be sufficient to earn the
'Huskers a preseason nod as eventual national champions from
``Preview Sports'' and ``Texas Football'' magazines, among others.
The first AP college football poll will not be released until Aug.
5. But Crouch said during yesterday's Big 12 media day that such
faith in a once fumble-prone offense is well-founded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen that most ratings that have us No. 1 or No. 2. But
I think we expect more of ourselves than anyone else could,'' said
Crouch, a junior who rushed for 889 yards and 16 touchdowns last
season. ``This year, we have much better leadership. Everyone is
focusing on each other and not themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, Crouch stands as the personification of the turnaround.
After being told during 1999 fall drills that he would not start,
Crouch left the team. He returned three days later after meeting
with Solich. Eventually, he regained the starting spot, then
received all-conference recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Crouch showed his supportive side yesterday, saying he believes
Nebraska's rebuilt defense will be strong enough to make a
national-title run because the Cornhuskers have ``a lot of great
players'' capable of filling the vacancies. Carlos Polk, an
all-conference middle linebacker, concurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defensively, I don't feel like we have any questions,'' said
Polk, the team's top returning tackler (83 tackles, 6.5 sacks).
``We're flattered to be the preseason No. 1, but we want to be the
postseason No. 1. If we play as hard as we can and leave it all on
the field, a national championship can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Just don't expect the Cornhuskers to receive unbridled praise
from rivals despite being a unanimous pick of league coaches to win
the Big 12 North Division. Colorado coach Gary Barnett said
yesterday that the talent gap between Nebraska and their conference
brethren is thinner than outsiders realize.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they are overwhelming favorites,'' Barnett said.
``With 85 scholarships \Rper school\S ... in this conference, you
won't see anybody overwhelm anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the message Solich attempted to convey yesterday while
deflecting speculation that his offense should average more than 40
points per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything along the lines of trying to project this football
team as the best in our conference or one of the best in the nation
is premature,'' Solich said. ``When you go through the Big 12, you
play your share of tough teams. You can't count anything in terms
of national championships until you get into the season and see how
things go with injuries and how things unfold. You essentially have
the chance to lose a game every week.''
</P>
<P>
   Just the same, Solich said he's comfortable with the heightened
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way, as a head coach, to control what the
expectations are,'' Solich said. ``There is a lot of optimism about
this team and the players are confident. That's a good thing. When
you have that, the expectations will be there.''

TEXAS TECH'S RICKY WILLIAMS AIMS FOR 1,000 YARDS RUSHING,
RECEIVING
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Ricky Williams is using reverse logic. The
way he sees it, a pass-oriented offense will help the Red Raiders'
running game.
</P>
<P>
   New Texas Tech coach Mike Leach, the architect of pass-happy
offenses at Oklahoma and Kentucky, will have the Red Raiders
throwing the ball 60 to 70 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the new offense will benefit me in varied ways,'' the
Texas Tech senior running back said yesterday at the league's
annual preseason media meeting. ``I think I'll be able to make
longer runs, have less carries and the field will be more open for
me because the defense will be spread out.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Williams rushed for 1,582 yards and averaged nearly 30
carries a game. In two seasons at Tech, he has 28 receptions. The
carries are expected to go down while the receptions should
increase.
</P>
<P>
   Leach has rarely had a running back such as Williams, whose 1999
season was derailed by a knee injury, to complement his passing
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a runner like Ricky, someone capable of gaining 1,000
yards, will be huge for this offense,'' said Leach, who makes his
head coaching debut Aug. 26 against New Mexico in Lubbock. ``We'll
get Ricky the ball as much as possible, but instead of handing it
to him so much we'll throw it to him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole career it's been Ricky can just run the football and
nothing else,'' Williams, 5-foot-9 and 195 pounds, said. ``I've
wanted to be an in-between back, somebody who can run and catch.''
</P>
<P>
   He plans on doing a lot of both. His goal is to total 1,000
yards rushing and 1,000 yards receiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't count Ricky Williams out on anything,'' Leach said.
\Nsubheds:Briefly Arrowhead Stadium officials estimate they have
sold 35,000 of their 60,000 ticket allotment for the Big 12
championship game Dec. 2 in Kansas City. Tickets are being sold to
only Kansas City Chiefs season ticket holders, but general public
ticket sales will start sometime in September.
</P>
<P>
   A media poll for the Big 12 Conference race predicts the
following order of finish: North _ Nebraska, Kansas State,
Colorado, Kansas, Iowa State and Missouri. South _ Texas, Oklahoma,
Texas A&AMP;M, Texas Tech, Oklahoma State and Baylor. Nebraska was
picked to defeat Texas in the Big 12 title game.

OFFICIALS QUESTION VALIDITY OF U.S. TRIBAL RECOGNITION 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Concerned that the federal government may soon
recognize two more Indian tribes in Connecticut, two state
officials said Thursday that they planned to convene dozens of
state and city officials in September to discuss the legitimacy of
the tribes' land claims and the validity of the recognition
process.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's announcement, made in a news conference by state
Attorney General Richard Blumenthal and the state Senate's majority
leader, George C. Jepsen, is the latest in a weeks-long series of
moves by elected officials troubled by recent indications from the
federal Bureau of Indian Affairs that it is poised to confer
recognition on the two tribes within a matter of months.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the prospect of that recognition a ``time bomb,'' Jepsen
said, ``There's a need in this state to bring elected and community
officials together so that we can all get up to speed together on
this enormously complex process and all the facts that go along
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The officials' concern stems from the assumption that once
recognized, the two Indian tribes under consideration _ the Eastern
Pequots and the Paucatuck Eastern Pequots _ will do what the
Mohegan and Mashantucket Pequot tribes have already done: use their
autonomy to build monumental casinos in hopes of making millions of
dollars a year in gambling revenue. Many residents fear losing
property to land claims, as well as traffic congestion and the
social costs of legalized gambling.
</P>
<P>
   On March 31, Kevin Gover, the top official in the Bureau of
Indian Affairs, a unit of the Interior Department, issued a
preliminary finding that the two tribes deserved official
recognition. The finding is the penultimate step in a years-long
federal process that Blumenthal and members of Connecticut's
Congressional delegation have repeatedly criticized as favoring the
tribes.
</P>
<P>
   Those criticisms center on their belief that Gover, the Interior
Department's assistant secretary in charge of approving recognition
claims submitted to the BIA, is predisposed to grant recognition to
tribes even if they have not completed the seven-step approval
process.
</P>
<P>
   After Thursday's news conference, Blumenthal sent a letter to
John Leshy, the Interior Department's solicitor, asking him to
recuse Gover, who is a Pawnee from Oklahoma, from the recognition
process for the two Connecticut tribes. The letter included a
quotation attributed to Gover in The Day, a New London newspaper,
in May. ``I would rather recognize someone who should not be
recognized than fail someone who should,'' Gover was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
   Early last month, Blumenthal wrote a letter to Interior
Secretary Bruce Babbitt, urging him to freeze all tribal
recognition requests until the department developed a way to ensure
they would be evaluated fairly and honestly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bureau of Indian Affairs is changing its criteria,
altering the rules of the game in the middle of the tribal
recognition process,'' Blumenthal said Thursday. ``It is unfair,
it's susceptible excessively to the interests of politics and
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Nedra Darling, a spokeswoman for the BIA, said the bureau's
process was fair and rigorous. ``We're following a code,'' she
said. ``It's a lot of roll-up-your-sleeves research and analytical
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other tribes in Connecticut, the Golden Hill Paugussetts and
the Schaghticoke Tribal Nation, which have been recognized by the
state for more than a century, have pending petitions for federal
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal and Jepsen said they would hold a summit, which they
said would include state and local officials and business and
tribal leaders, on Sept. 14 in a location to be named near
Bridgeport. They said they would invite Indian leaders as well as
officials from the BIA, though when contacted Thursday, only the
Schaghticoke chief, Richard Velky, said he planned to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their process is broken down,'' he said of the federal bureau.
``You've got too many groups out there calling themselves a nation
or a tribe.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael D. O'Connell, a lawyer for the Golden Hill Paugussetts,
whose 100 members live on two reservations, in Bridgeport and near
Colchester, Conn., said he was wary of attending the meeting. ``My
fear is that it's just intended to be another opportunity to bash
the various Indian tribes,'' he said. ``We'll wait to see if we're
invited.''

COWBOYS PLAN TRIBUTE TO TOM LANDRY
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Cowboys owner Jerry Jones unveiled
yesterday the initial plans for a seasonlong tribute to legendary
coach Tom Landry, who died in February.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the tribute, a patch bearing a tiny replica of
Landry's trademark Fedora will be emblazoned above and to the left
of the numbers on the Cowboys' jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hat says it all,'' Jones said. ``It's the same hat we have
in the ring of honor. I think that it will be recognized throughout
the world of sports immediately as the recognition of Coach
Landry.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who fired Landry when he bought the team in 1989, said
the Cowboys have many other things in store to recognize ``what
coach Landry was and is about to this organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones only revealed one other element yesterday: Cowboys game
tickets will feature a different photo of Landry each week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've said he is the most significant person and personality
in the history of the franchise,'' Jones said. ``What we are going
to do on our tickets is in keeping to what we are doing on the
jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   Landry, who died at age 75 after a battle with leukemia, was the
head coach of the Cowboys for the franchise's first 29 years. Under
Landry, the Cowboys were 270-178-6, including two Super Bowl titles
and five conference crowns.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys head coach Dave Campo, who came to the Cowboys with
Landry's successor Jimmy Johnson in 1989, said the tribute is
``applicable and appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No. 1, when you talk about the Dallas Cowboys, you are
obviously talking about Tom Landry,'' Campo said. ``The tradition
is there. What he did for football is without question one of the
top stories in sports. It's an honor for our guys and me especially
to have that distinction on the uniform.''

D.H. BLAIR BROKERAGE AND EXECUTIVES INDICTED IN FRAUD CASE
</HEADLINE>
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ D.H. Blair &AMP; Co., a defunct Manhattan brokerage firm,
and 15 of its officers and employees were indicted Thursday on
securities fraud charges by a grand jury in Manhattan. The firm's
executives, prosecutors said, reaped illegal profit by manipulating
stock prices, engaged in high-pressure sales tactics to generate
excessive commissions and stole investor data from other firms to
increase their customer base.
</P>
<P>
   The 173-count indictment, announced by District Attorney Robert
M. Morgenthau, charged that from 1989 to 1998 executives and
stockbrokers at D.H. Blair ran the firm as a criminal enterprise.
Morgenthau said that Kenton Wood, Blair's chairman, supervised the
fraud, as did Alan Stahler and Kalman Renov, the vice chairmen.
D.H. Blair ceased operation in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation began in the fall of 1997 and grew out of
Morgenthau's prosecution of A.R. Baron, a fraudulent brokerage firm
that bilked investors out of $75 million. When Baron closed in
1996, most of its brokers moved to D.H. Blair.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50,000 customers invested with Blair in the period
covered by the indictment, prosecutors said. One victim, a
56-year-old disabled man from Colorado, lost $150,000 from a
disability settlement that he had allocated for medical bills and
living expenses. A 70-year-old Florida man lost $250,000 from his
retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``D.H. Blair's was a sophisticated fraud,'' said Daniel J.
Castleman, chief of the investigation division in the district
attorney's office. ``They were dealing with real companies, but
manipulating prices of stock by illegal means in order for favored
customers to make money.''
</P>
<P>
   Castleman said Blair officials falsified business records,
suppressed clients' complaints and misled securities regulators to
evade detection. The firm's chief stock trader and 11 of its
registered representatives were also named in the indictment. Three
former brokers have admitted securities fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Stahler and Wood called the charges baseless and
said their clients would contest them vigorously. Renov's lawyer
did not return a phone call.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors could not specify how much was stolen from
investors. They said Blair manipulated shares of 10 companies taken
public by an associated firm, D.H. Blair Investment Banking. The
investment bank was not named in the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the National Association of Securities
Dealers took action against D.H. Blair, which resulted in a $2.4
million restitution fund.
</P>
<P>
   D.H. Blair Investment Banking, which was spun off from the
brokerage firm in 1992, is now run by J. Morton Davis, who presided
over D.H. Blair &AMP; Co. for more than 20 years. Eight years ago, he
turned the brokerage operation over to family members. Stahler and
Renov, the vice chairmen indicted yesterday, are sons-in-law of
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Davis wrote a book entitled ``From Hard Knocks to
Hot Stocks: How I Made A Fortune Through Smart Investing and How
You Can, Too.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say the investigation of D.H. Blair &AMP; Co. is
continuing.

LONGHORNS' EARLY HAUL FILLS OFFENSIVE-LINE NEED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Addressing areas of need in recruiting can be as vital as the
number of blue-chip recruits a school signs.
</P>
<P>
   More than six months before national signing day, Texas coach
Mack Brown has almost filled the Longhorns' top priority.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns are looking to sign a strong offensive-line class
on Feb. 7, national signing day, and have picked up commitments
from six top recruits at the position.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have identified a need and they have wrapped it up pretty
well,'' said Jeremy Crabtree, director of college recruiting for
Rivals.com. ``All those guys are in the top 100 at their position.
It allows them, now that they have their big need addressed, to go
after need No. 2 \Rdefensive tackles\S and need No. 3
\Rlinebackers\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Carter High School offensive lineman Jonathan Scott
(6-foot-7, 282 pounds) was the first player to commit to Texas and
is the most highly regarded. Rivals100.com ranks Scott as the
third-best offensive lineman in the country. Max Emfinger's
National Blue Chips Online evaluated Scott as the top weakside
offensive tackle in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Scott committed to Texas after attending the Longhorns' summer
camp in early June.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like I was just in awe,'' Scott said. ``Everything
there was just top notch and first class. The team was really
committed to winning a national championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas stole one of its offensive-line commitments from its
biggest rival. Galena Park's Mike Garcia committed to Texas A&AMP;M
during his junior year, but switched his commitment to Texas in
June.
</P>
<P>
   Blinn College offensive lineman Alfio Randall has committed to
Texas for the second time. Two years ago at Houston Yates, he was
considered one of the top offensive linemen in the nation and
committed to Texas, but had to go to junior college after not
qualifying academically.
</P>
<P>
   Abe Robinson of Jersey Village, Roman Reeves of Livingston and
Will Allen of Cypress Falls round out the Longhorns' early haul of
offensive linemen.
</P>
<P>
   Scott is glad Texas is signing a large number of offensive
lineman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the competition,'' Scott said. ``The more competition,
the better I can get as a player.''
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns have also gathered commitments from two players
with local ties to help them out at safety in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Trinity High School quarterback Braden Johnson had a strong
showing at summer camps this year and was offered a scholarship to
Texas in June and committed to the Longhorns on June 19.
</P>
<P>
   Former Stephenville quarterback Kendal Briles, who transferred
to Wolfforth Frenship after his father, former Stephenville coach
Art Briles, took an assistant coaching position at Texas Tech, did
not follow his father to the Red Raiders. Instead, he chose to
switch positions to safety and committed to the Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody I've talked to kept asking, `When are going to
commit to Tech?' '' Kendal Briles said. ``I've liked UT since I was
young, and dreamed of getting a scholarship and going there. I was
open to whatever position I'd play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies have also looked to secure their future at the safety
position, where they return only two players with playing
experience for the upcoming season. Two of Texas A&AMP;M's three early
commitments have come from safeties: Dallas Kimball's Jarvis Mays
and Friendswood's Jaxon Appel.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've done a good job,'' Crabtree said of A&AMP;M. ``Any time
you get a kid from Kimball, you know you are getting a very
athletic player that can fly all over the field.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU has picked up two early commitments, from Snyder wide
receiver Matthew Grimmett (37 receptions, 858 yards) and Midland
Lee kicker Michael Wynn.

Fort Worth Star-Telegram
Baseball commissioner Bud Selig has had two weeks to digest the
findings of the Blue Ribbon Panel on Baseball Economics
commissioned by Major League Baseball. The panel recommended
increased revenue sharing and the possible relocation of struggling
franchises. The commissioner recently took a few minutes in a
question-and-answer session with Star-Telegram staff writer Simon
Gonzalez to share his thoughts on the panel's conclusions, and on
the state of the game.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: What do you think of the report from the blue-ribbon
committee?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Obviously, it shows we have a problem. I think the report
is a very powerful document that has more economic backup
information than we've ever released before.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: The report graphically illustrated the economic disparity
between clubs. The Yankees generated $177.9 million in revenue last
season, while the Expos generated $48.8 million. Is that disparity
the biggest problem facing the game?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``There's no question. There's no doubt that that's true.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you sell that to owners who are going to be asked to
give up even more of their money in revenue sharing?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``That's something that, if I move this process along, they
gave me the authority last year to do that. There's no question
there's a problem. If the renaissance, which is remarkable right
now, if we want this to continue, we have to solve this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: You're referring to the so-called ``best interests of the
game'' powers. Can you use that to force increased revenue sharing?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``I don't want to get into the specifics, but, yes, there are
some things I can do. I hope I'll be able to do it in a little
different style, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Without using the word ``force,'' perhaps?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Right.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: One criticism of the commissioner is that as the former owner
of a small-market franchise, you are too focused on the plight of
the small-market clubs at the expense of the large-market clubs. Is
that valid?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``I don't hear that much any more. I think the disparity
problem has been so detailed out _ and I think this report helps _
that my experience as an owner has really turned out to be a very
helpful experience. I have 30 clubs to worry about, and I don't
have any previous disposition to help one over the other. But it's
the small and medium-market clubs, including the one there in
Texas, that are being affected by the disparity. One needs to be
fair, but we have a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: There is some skepticism about the claims in the report that
all but three teams are losing money. Locally, people look at the
Rangers playing in a revenue-generating ballpark before 35,000
people every night and wonder how they can be losing money. Are the
numbers accurate?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``I know that there are people who say they have different
books and who's kidding who, and that is so galling. Independent
audits are conducted on all clubs. Every club has their own
auditors, just like every major company in America. They're
rechecked by Ernst &AMP; Young on behalf of Major League Baseball.
Then, PricewaterhouseCoopers comes in, and they conduct a separate
audit for revenue-sharing purposes. Also, the Basic Agreement
provides the Players Association access to all club data and the
right to conduct its own independent audit if they have any
problems. Rob \RManfred, MLB's executive vice president for Labor
Relations and Human Resources\S tells me they've never asked for
any further audit. These are being audited three times by three
different firms. So, this business of, well, anybody can do
anything they want, that's just nonsense. That's just sheer
nonsense. I've run a team. I know my own team's figures, I know
everybody else's. I've spent hours going over it. It's just
malarkey.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: If only three clubs are making money, how can teams afford to
share more revenue?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``It's a question of moving revenues around, which I think
helps everybody, including the big-market clubs, frankly. There are
only three clubs making money, there isn't any doubt about that.
But I do think that revenue sharing and a more sensible economic
system will help all the clubs. We have a system now that's
producing very few profitable clubs.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Attempts by the owners to change the system in the past have
caused labor strife. Do you have any indication that there will be
major problems with the union when it comes time to negotiate the
next collective bargaining agreement?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``I can't tell you that. Their response has been quite muted
and controlled.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Based on history, is it possible to get a new collective
bargaining agreement without some kind of work stoppage?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``I hope so. I think that's one of the challenges that lies
ahead. I think we've had eight of them, and we just have to find a
different way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the fact that the game suffered so much because of the
strike in '94 likely to make both the owners and the union leery of
more labor strife this time?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Only time will tell, but I certainly think all of us are
very sensitive. Very sensitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: The report also recommended that struggling franchises be
allowed to change cities. Do you anticipate that happening?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``I don't know right now. It's something I'm going to take a
look at in the coming months.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Realignment was postponed until 2002, at the earliest. Is
geographic realignment a goal at some point?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``We need to have some realignment at some point, but I'm so
delighted we got to an unbalanced schedule. That was my major
goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you surprised that, given the opportunity the Rangers
seemed to have to get into a division with teams from the same time
zone, they opted to stay in the West?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``I understand why they made that decision. They had a
different view than \Rformer part-owner\S George W. Bush did, but I
wasn't surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: The report details the economic disparities and says that 27
franchises are losing money, while at the same time attendance is
up and new stadiums are being built. On balance, as you look to the
future of baseball, are you optimistic or pessimistic?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``I'm very optimistic. I think this renaissance is
unbelievable. We're going to set an all-time attendance record this
year, and I think the game has never been more popular. I don't
think there's any doubt about that. But I also know for us to take
advantage of what we have, that we've got to solve the disparity
problem. How we solve that remains to be seen; I know I have to be
sensitive to all the agendas here. But the fact of the matter is we
have to solve this problem. There's no ifs, ands or buts about
it.''

   MOORPARK, Calif. _ Shares of Accelerated Networks lost half
their value Thursday, one day after the Moorpark-based
telecommunications equipment maker reported a loss greater than
analysts expected.
</P>
<P>
   Accelerated lost $20.69 a share, or 49 percent, on volume of
7million shares, its heaviest trading since the Ventura County
company went public in June. It closed at $21.31 a share in a day
that saw losses across most of the technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   Accelerated's chief financial officer, Fred Boyer, would not
comment on the volatility of the market but concentrated on the
bright side.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to remain very positive in our outlook of our
business,'' he said. ``We're here to build shareholder value.''
</P>
<P>
   The company reported losses of $8.3 million, or 19 cents a
share, in the second quarter. A First Call/Thomson Financial
consensus of analysts had predicted a loss of 17 cents a share. The
company also reported sales of $8.8 million compared with $1.2
million in the second quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Three brokerage firms began tracking Accelerated last week,
rating its stock a ``buy'' or ``strong buy.'' Analysts from the
three firms did not return phone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Accelerated operates a 23,000-square-foot facility in Moorpark
and a 15,000-square-foot facility in Simi Valley.

SENATE APPROVES $288 BILLION MILITARY BUDGET
</HEADLINE>
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate joined the House on Thursday in
approving a military spending bill of $287.8 billion for next year,
more than $5.1 billion more than requested by the Pentagon or the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which was adopted by a vote of 91 to 9, is an
increase of more than $21.7 billion over the current fiscal year.
That figure alone is greater than the entire foreign aid budget.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which will next go to the president, includes a 3.7
percent increase in military pay. The additional $5.1 billion over
the nearly $16 billion increase requested by the administration
would go mainly for military research contracts that are in states
and Congressional districts of influential lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   In the brief debate over the bill, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
criticized his colleagues. McCain noted that nearly $2 billion
worth of items that had not been requested by the administration
and were not part of the bills originally passed by the House and
Senate had been added by House-Senate conferees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the surplus,'' McCain said in an interview in response to
a question of how so many spending items ended up in the bill.
``This kind of spending just grows and grows. And these are
Republican fiscal conservatives. It's disgraceful and it's obscene
and I am embarrassed by it.''
</P>
<P>
   With the passage of the bill Congress has completed its work on
about half the $600 billion in discretionary spending that it says
it wants to spend in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   But after a week of frenetic activity on a number of spending
bills, including those financing the Treasury, Labor, Health and
Human Services, departments and the White House, Congress had
little to show for its work as it moved toward its month-long
August recess. At the beginning of the week, Republicans were
hopeful that the House would complete work on all 13 spending
bills, and perhaps even approve at least one measure that had
emerged from a House-Senate conference. But problems soon cropped
up. Senate Democrats stalled consideration of a spending measures
covering operations for the Department of the Treasury, the White
House and other federal agencies as a protest over what they
considered the body's slow pace in confirming President Clinton's
judicial appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the bill became bogged down the White House and
Congressional Republicans entered into tentative negotiations early
in the week over three spending measures. But the talks never
progressed beyond the staff level.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the week, Senate Democrats halted their delaying
tactics. But time had run out for any of the spending bills _ other
than military _ to be considered before the recess. ``It's
disappointing,'' said Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla. and the Senate
whip. ``And I don't think the Democrats' strategy is a defensible
one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want us to pass these bills because they want to
force us into some big summit with an omnibus bill so they can get
more spending,'' said Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the House Majority
Whip. ``Well, we ain't going there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate minority leader, Tom Daschle, D-S.D., did not dispute
the notion that his party slowed down spending bills. But Daschle
replied that Democrats did so in response to the Republican's
reneging on a promise to hold hearings on a raft of judicial
appointments, including at least one nominee for appellate court
judge who had been waiting for 42 months.

DEFENDANTS PLEAD NOT GUILTY IN KILLINGS OF WENDY'S WORKERS
</HEADLINE>
  By EUN LEE KOH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The two men accused of killing five workers in a
massacre at a Wendy's restaurant in Queens on May 24 pleaded not
guilty Thursday to murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   The men, John B. Taylor, 36, and Craig Godineaux, 30, were
arraigned in the Queens County Courthouse on 50 counts, including
murder, attempted murder and robbery, in the slayings at the
Flushing restaurant, where seven employees were shot one by one in
the head.
</P>
<P>
   Five were killed: Ramon Nazario, Anita C. Smith, Jean Dumel
Auguste and Jeremy Mele and Ali Ibadat. Two other workers _
Jaquione Johnson and Patrick Castro _ survived the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   With the arraignments, the Queens district attorney, Richard A.
Brown, has 120 days to decide whether to seek the death penalty in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   The lead prosecutor, Gregory L. Lasak, said in court Thursday
that the defendants made several incriminating statements to
detectives after their arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ```OK, I tell you the truth _ I shot five of them,''' Lasak
quoted Godineaux as saying to detectives.
</P>
<P>
   Godineaux denied killing Smith, the lone female victim, blaming
Taylor, Lasak said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers declined to comment on the statements read in
court.
</P>
<P>
   Family members of the victims wept as they left the courtroom,
and some expressed a hope that the district attorney would seek the
death penalty for the two men.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting back tears, Benjamin Nazario, the brother of Ramon
Nazario, said, ``I want them dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't give none of those people in Wendy's any kind of
mercy,'' Nazario said. ``They're lucky they are going through the
trial system.''
</P>
<P>
   Godineaux's lawyer, Colleen Brady, said she hoped that the
publicity surrounding the case would not influence Brown's decision
on whether to seek the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The two defendants are being held without bail and are scheduled
to return to court on Nov. 20.

WEB STUDIO MAKES JUMP TO HIGH SPEED
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BURBANK, Calif. _ Z.com, a Burbank Web studio backed by key
Hollywood investors, announced Thursday it will team with leading
broadband provider ExciteHome to showcase its online entertainment
over high-speed cable and DSL lines.
</P>
<P>
   The site's original online comedy, film, animation, game and
live events will also give ExciteHome subscribers a taste of
real-time Web video and other new media fare geared to broadband,
company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives us an opportunity to experiment with someone who is
leading the charge in bringing broadband to the home,'' said Z.com
Chief Executive Officer Joe DiNunzio. ``The exposure is incredibly
important to help a small start-up like us break through the
clutter.''
</P>
<P>
   Founding investors in Z.com, which grew out of Pasadena business
incubator idealab!, include film producer Jerry Bruckheimer,
Maverick Records partner and co-CEO Guy Oseary, talent management
firm 3 Arts Entertainment, and Basic Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The site launched in early June and will continue to roll out
new ``channels'' _ Web pages dedicated to particular Web shows,
specials or media _ throughout the summer, DiNunzio said.
</P>
<P>
   ExciteHome, based in Redwood City, Calif., has the nation's
largest customer base for high-speed Internet service, serving
about 1.5 million homes nationwide, including Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Content from companies like Z.com is intended to make the
service more appealing, said Jonathan Rosenberg, a senior vice
president with the service provider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our leadership in broadband depends on our ability to provide
high-quality and compelling content to our subscribers,'' Rosenberg
said in a statement. ``Z.com greatly enhances the ExciteHome
service by delivering fresh and original content.''
</P>
<P>
   The Z.com content will be available to customers through the
Excite ClickVideo, a broadband video application accessed through
the Home connection.
</P>
<P>
   Other Internet users have access to the same content by going to
Z.com's regular Web page.
</P>
<P>
   The programming will include a video scrapbook of Ellen
DeGeneres' cross-country comedy tour; Z.com's popular reality game
show ``Dare for Dollars''; and ``Alanis Morissette _ The One
Tour,'' an 11-country musical and cultural journey.
</P>
<P>
   In return, ExciteHome will run Z.com advertising and promotion
across its network.

SCREEN ACTORS GUILD UPSET BY TIGER'S CAR COMMERCIAL
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tiger Woods may be the world's most dominant and
admired golfer, but to the Screen Actors Guild he's just another
commercial actor who should _ repeat (italics) should (end italics)
_ be on strike.
</P>
<P>
   Only days after Woods' triumphant win at the British Open, the
actors union notified him Thursday that he will be called before
its trial board to explain why he filmed a Buick commercial in
Canada this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Woods violated rule No. 1 of the current commercials
strike by accepting nonunion work,'' said SAG President William
Daniels. ``Accordingly, Screen Actors Guild plans to notify him of
the date and time of his trial board, whereupon he will be asked to
explain his actions.''
</P>
<P>
   The date and time of the inquisition were not announced.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising industry strike negotiator and spokesman Ira Shepard
called the SAG announcement an ``empty threat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the union gets anywhere by threatening an
American hero,'' Shepard said. ``As the strike continues, more and
more major celebrities of all kinds will adhere to their
contractual obligations to the major advertising agencies and cross
the union picket line.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, though, teen star Britney Spears and members of boy
band 'N Sync endorsed the strike, with Spears cancelling a
lucrative Clairol commercial and pledging, along with 'N Sync
members, to donate proceeds from upcoming concerts to the SAG
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The strike is now in its 14th week with no end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   A meeting in New York last week intended to restart negotiations
quickly fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   Striking commercial actors want to be paid for each airing of a
commercial on cable television, a residual system now used for
network ads. They also want union jurisdiction over Internet ads.
</P>
<P>
   The ad industry opposes residuals for cable and Internet ads and
wants to eliminate the pay-per-play network residual system with
one based on a flat fee.

FEDERAL JUDGE APPROVES SALE OF S.F. CHRONICLE TO HEARST CORP.
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By WILLIAM CARLSEN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ A federal judge Thursday approved the Hearst
Corp.'s purchase of the San Francisco Chronicle, finding that the
sale did not violate antitrust law, and reluctantly cleared the way
for the publishers of the thrice-weekly Independent to acquire the
Examiner.
<P>
   Under the terms of the two deals, Hearst is expected to quickly
complete its purchase of The Chronicle, then operate the Examiner
during a four-month transition period before giving the paper _
along with a $66 million three-year subsidy _ to the Fang family,
which publishes the Independent.
</P>
<P>
   But in scorching comments Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Vaughn
Walker called the Fang deal ``malodorous'' and noted that the
transaction could violate antitrust laws.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge was also clearly offended by what he called the
politics of the transaction. He blamed ``cronyism'' for delaying
The Chronicle sale for seven months, then agreeing to back off only
after Hearst agreed to give the Examiner to the Fangs, who are
ardent political supporters of Mayor Willie Brown and the city's
entrenched Democratic political machine.
</P>
<P>
   Walker specifically noted that Brown and Sen. Dianne Feinstein
intervened in the process in a way that strongly influenced the
Hearst Corp. to cut a deal with the Fangs _ apparently in exchange
for dropping their pressure on the Justice Department to
investigate The Chronicle sale.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's most scathing comments were reserved, however, for
the Department of Justice. He said he was ``astonished and
disappointed that the DOJ would allow itself to be put in a
position where the inference can be so easily drawn that its action
or inaction in the case was political favoritism masquerading as
law enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Halling, the San Francisco attorney who represented the
Hearst Corp., said he was extremely pleased with the judge's
ruling. ``It strongly vindicated the position that Hearst has taken
throughout the proceedings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He confirmed that Hearst has a binding contract to transfer the
Examiner to the Fang family.
</P>
<P>
   But another attorney close to the case, who asked not to be
identified, noted that Walker all but invited a competitor such as
the San Francisco Bay Guardian or SF Weekly to challenge the Fang
deal as a violation of antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Any such challenge would go to Walker and the Fang deal could be
ruled illegal, which would absolve Hearst of its contractual
obligation to the Fangs.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Lindstrom, one of the lawyers who represented the Chronicle
Publishing Co., said: ``Obviously, we're gratified that the judge
has vindicated the Chronicle's position. ... Not only did the judge
find that the transaction does not violate antitrust laws, he found
... that it is pro-competitive and good for the Bay Area.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hearst Corp. announced it was buying The Chronicle last
August 6 at staff meetings in the Examiner and Chronicle newsrooms.
Hearst's Chief Executive Officer Frank Bennack Jr. calmed the fears
of both newspaper staffs by telling them that they would be
guaranteed jobs in the new Hearst-owned Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it was also putting the Examiner up for sale,
including the paper's masthead, archives, subscribers' and
advertisers' lists, but no hard assets such as printing presses,
offices or delivery trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Examiner is an afternoon paper with a declining
circulation _ a lethal formula that has sent dozens of papers to
their graves _ few expected anyone to take Hearst up on the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst said it would dissolve the 34-year-old joint operating
agreement that had allowed the two papers to combine business
operations and split the profits evenly, but kept the two newsrooms
editorially separate.
</P>
<P>
   Based on U.S. Justice Department approval in similar earlier
newspaper takeovers, Hearst officials expected The Chronicle
purchase to go quickly. But the plan ran into obstacles almost
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next nine months, the deal was sidetracked by a
remarkable convergence of hidden agendas, backroom maneuverings and
political alliances intended to serve the city's top Democratic
political figures.
</P>
<P>
   Before it was over, the proposed deal claimed the job of the
Examiner's publisher, embarrassed top officers of both newspapers,
raised questions about journalistic ethics and lifted the lid on
the long-secret finances that had allowed The Chronicle and
Examiner to dominate Bay Area media for over 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks of the August announcement, Mayor Willie Brown
called U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno, who promised to look into
any antitrust implications of the sales.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ted Fang contacted Warren Hellman, a prominent San
Francisco financier and civic leader, for advice about buying the
Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the Independent began a grassroots ``Stop the
Monopoly'' campaign blasting The Chronicle sale, which resulted in
a flurry of public hearings and resolutions by city leaders
questioning the proposed transaction.
</P>
<P>
   By November, Justice Department lawyers had opened an formal
inquiry into the deal and officials from the Examiner and Chronicle
turned over 174 boxes of documents to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst officers said that they had received no solid offers for
the Examiner and were preparing to close the paper. But in
December, the government lawyers told Hearst officials that the
Examiner sale had been inadequate. If they proceeded to shut down
the paper and complete the Chronicle purchase, Hearst faced a
possible department antitrust suit.
</P>
<P>
   In his second inaugural address, Brown announced in January that
saving the Examiner was a priority and that he hoped to put
together a group of investors to buy it. He held several meetings
with Hellman and Fang.
</P>
<P>
   Later that month, the political pressure mounted. Brown led a
delegation to Examiner publisher Tim White's office to insist that
the Hearst Corp. ``sweeten'' the terms of the Examiner sale. The
delegation included Rep. Nancy Pelosi and City Attorney Louise
Renne.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, on January 21, Feinstein, a member of the Senate's
powerful judiciary committee, invited White to a lunch with
Florence Fang, the matriarch of the Fang family.
</P>
<P>
   Fang told White that her family wanted the Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Four days later, as it had indicated a month earlier to the
Justice Department, Hearst reoffered the Examiner for sale, this
time with delivery trucks, a printing plant, news racks, a computer
system and office building _ everything needed to publish the paper
without missing an edition.
</P>
<P>
   But there were still no takers and the Justice Department
pressed Hearst hard to offer its share of the lucrative joint
operating agreement _ due to expire in 2005 _ or an equivalent in
order to keep the Examiner from folding.
</P>
<P>
   As negotiations continued, real estate investor and former
mayoral candidate Clint Reilly jumped into the fray. On January 11,
he filed suit to block the Chronicle sale, contending that the deal
violated federal antitrust laws and would give Hearst a monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   In February, in settlement talks with Hearst, Reilly also made a
bid for the Examiner. But on March 17, Hearst announced that it had
cut a deal with Ted Fang, giving the Examiner to the Fang family
with a three-year subsidy of $66 million.
</P>
<P>
   On March 30, the Justice Department cleared the transaction. But
Reilly, who said a subsidy as large as $250 million would be needed
to save the Examiner, had refused to drop his suit.
</P>
<P>
   The same day, Walker granted Reilly's request for a temporary
injunction blocking the Chronicle sale and the transfer of the
Examiner to the Fangs.
</P>
<P>
   The trial that ensued proved to be a public spectacle for two
publishing companies that had always _ as privately held
enterprises _ operated behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   On May 1, the opening day, Examiner Publisher Tim White
testified that he had offered to ``horse trade'' favorable
treatment for Mayor Brown in the paper's editorial pages in
exchange for Brown's support for the Chronicle deal.
</P>
<P>
   The remark set off protests on the staffs of the Examiner and
Chronicle. Embarrassed Hearst officials suspended White and started
an internal investigation into whether any journalistic ethics had
been compromised.
</P>
<P>
   The second day, Chronicle Publishing's top executive John Sias,
was caught in misstatement during cross-examination by Reilly
attorney Joseph M. Alioto, and he quipped that he had been exposed
as a ``perjurer.''
</P>
<P>
   Reams of financial data about the papers' revenue, expenses and
profits emerged during the trial, some of it showing that Hearst
was making considerably more profit than The Chronicle from their
joint operating agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto argued that the sale of the Examiner to the Fangs was a
``sham,'' designed to fail and leave Hearst with a newspaper
monopoly in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   But Hearst attorneys defended the unusual subsidy to the Fangs
as a ``business'' decision they did not like but believed was
necessary to avoid a lengthy court battle with the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Walker appeared bothered by the subsidy and the appearance that
politics may have influenced the final outcome. In two unusual
written exchanges with the Justice Department, he pressed for
explanations of why the department held up the sale for seven
months then dropped its investigation after Hearst cut its deal
with the Fangs.
</P>
<P>
   Did the department conclude that the Hearst purchase of The
Chronicle really violated antitrust law before the Fang deal, he
asked.
</P>
<P>
   But the department never gave him the clear answers he wanted,
stating instead that it never reached the hard antitrust issues
because the Fang transaction satisfied its concern that some form
of newspaper competition in San Francisco continue.  &LR;

STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL RULES QUACKENBUSH FOUNDATIONS ILLEGAL
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Former Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush
acted illegally when he set up nonprofit foundations to settle what
were alleged to be insurance companies' violations arising from the
Northridge earthquake, the state attorney general said in a formal
opinion released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The opinion by Attorney General Bill Lockyer may add weight to
the criminal investigation of Quackenbush and his activities at the
department and help earthquake victims recover money either through
lawsuits or reopened claims.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before legislative hearings earlier this year,
Quackenbush and his top lawyer at the department had insisted that
the establishment of the foundations was legal. Quackenbush later
resigned to avoid almost certain impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opinion, I believe, makes it very clear for all of us that
the conduct of the insurance commissioner was illegal,'' said state
Sen. Jackie Speier, D-Hillsborough, who requested the opinion. ``He
did not have the authority to make those settlements or request or
demand that money be contributed to foundations.''
</P>
<P>
   During the legislative inquiry, department officials testified
that they had recommended that insurance companies pay hundreds of
millions of dollars in fines. Instead, Quackenbush permitted the
companies to pay $13 million into nonprofit foundations, most of
which went to commercials featuring the commissioner and other
political activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us had a sense of disbelief, incredulity and outrage
that much of the activity going on in the Department of Insurance
was in (Quackenbush's) belief legal,'' Speier said. ``We now have
evidence that it was not legal, it was not politics as usual _ it
was downright wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The opinion by Lockyer states that although the insurance
commissioner has authority to set up foundations, their purpose
must be directly tied to the enforcement action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commissioner may not include a term of a settlement
requiring payment of funds to a private charitable foundation for
the purpose of supporting activities unrelated to the regulatory
enforcement responsibilities of the Department of Insurance in the
proceeding,'' the opinion states.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush's lawyer said the former commissioner took the legal
advice he was given.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything he did with the settlements was based on legal
advice,'' said Sacramento attorney Donald Heller. ``He acted in
good faith. He was told that he was acting appropriately and
lawfully.''
</P>
<P>
   Heller said Quackenbush used the foundations for outreach, which
is part of his statutory obligation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are additional facts that might change the
conclusion of the opinion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockyer said in Los Angeles that the opinion took time because
there was no legal precedent to build on.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The opinion) clearly outlines that the insurance commissioner
has some serious limitations on his ability to direct settlement
monies to private, nonprofit foundations,'' Lockyer said.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how much weight the opinion will have in the
continuing state and federal criminal investigations. Lockyer has
confirmed that a federal grand jury is hearing evidence in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not in any way binding on the court, but it might be a
signal that the attorney general thinks a crime was committed,''
said Michael Vitiello, a law professor at the University of the
Pacific's McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento. ``What has to
happen next in federal court is that (Quackenbush) must be indicted
by a grand jury. The state attorney general's view on a violation
of state law is irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Vitiello said, ``This can't be good news for
Quackenbush.''
</P>
<P>
   With the legal authority to create the settlements now in doubt,
Speier said she believes that the Department of Insurance should
reopen its examinations of the insurance companies' handling of
claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those settlements are void, and you always have the right to
set aside void acts,'' Speier said. ``I think the new insurance
commissioner should reopen the negotiations with the insurance
companies, reopen the market-conduct exams and reopen the
possibility of fines.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark Kelso, a law professor, has been acting insurance
commissioner since Quackenbush resigned. In a brief statement, he
said Thursday that the opinion ``raises complex legal issues'' and
that he will consult with Lockyer on the full implications of the
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis said he will appoint a permanent successor to
Quackenbush next week. The nominee, who must be confirmed by the
Legislature, will serve out Quackenbush's term through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The market-conduct exams _ sensitive audits detailing insurers'
alleged claims-handling violations after the Northridge earthquake
in 1994 _ have been at the center of the allegations surrounding
Quackenbush.
</P>
<P>
   The documents say state regulators found that some insurance
companies had a tendency to lowball policyholder claims and delay
payments.
</P>
<P>
   Victims may not directly receive restitution even after this
ruling, Speier acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The insurance commissioner generally cannot get restitution,''
she said. ``But there is the right to fine and order companies to
reopen claims. I think there is a strong opportunity to have claims
reopened.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, several lawsuits have been filed on behalf of
Northridge victims and taxpayers, demanding a return of the money.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Kronland, a San Francisco lawyer representing taxpayers,
said Lockyer's opinion will be ``very helpful to us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it supports the same theory that we are arguing _ that
the commissioner did not have the authority to put the money not in
the general fund, but in private funds used for political
purposes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But representatives of the insurance companies said Thursday
that the money paid to the foundations was not related to the
market-conduct exams and that no fines are warranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our voluntary participation in (the foundation) was not a part
of the market-conduct survey,'' said Bill Sirola, a spokesman for
State Farm. ``It was for what we think is a very important
scientific study of earthquake damage assessment on residential
buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   Sirola said State Farm has responded to the market-conduct exams
and maintains its position.
</P>
<P>
   ``We paid no fine, and we will pay no fine,'' he said. ``We
still have a claims office in Northridge, and we continue to say
that any policyholder who feels they have problem should recontact
us.''

HOW FAR BEHIND ARE CALIFORNIA HORSES?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Breeders' Cup at Churchill Downs is 100 days away. Do
California horses have time to catch up? How far behind the rest of
the nation are they really?
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood Park racing secretary Martin Panza, understandably a
West Coast partisan, sticks to the attitude that we've got the East
Coast horses right where we want them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're sitting in a good spot,'' Panza said Wednesday
while taking in the opening-day races at Del Mar. ``The only race
where it might be an uphill battle is the Classic. And if Dubai
Millennium (the world's top horse) comes, it's not West vs. East,
it's U.S. vs. Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Panza blamed ``the New York press'' for underrating the
California horses this year.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the perception that a disproportionate number of
the top thoroughbreds are racing in the East this summer is not
confined to the New York papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's more than a perception,'' said Joe Harper, Del
Mar's president, CEO and general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 27 horses receiving votes in this week's NTRA poll, only
three are known to be pointing for races at the Del Mar meet that
dominates the scene west of the Mississippi until Sept. 13: General
Challenge and Early Pioneer in the Aug. 26 Pacific Classic and
Riboletta in the Aug. 12 Clement Hirsch.
</P>
<P>
   Of the seven division leaders in Daily Racing Form national
handicapper Mike Watchmaker's rankings, only Kona Gold (No.1 among
sprinters) is scheduled to race at Del Mar (in Saturday's Bing
Crosby Handicap).
</P>
<P>
   The NTRA poll is dominated by eastern voters, and Watchmaker is
a New Yorker, so maybe there's bias at work. But note that in the
NTRA poll exactly a year ago, eight of the 23 ranked horses were
running at Del Mar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dance with the partners we have here and let the chips fall
where they may,'' said Harper (whose poker games must be quite a
sight). ``Obviously, big-name horses draw crowds. You've got to try
to develop your local stars and try to attract out-of-town stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars are leaving faster than they're arriving. Reopened
Arlington racetrack near Chicago apparently will lure Dark
Moondancer and Bienamado to the Arlington Million on Aug. 19 and
leading West Coast turf mare Happyanunoit to the Beverly D Stakes
the same day.
</P>
<P>
   At least Dark Moondancer will warm up for the Million by running
as the favorite in Sunday's $400,000 Eddie Read Handicap at Del
Mar.
</P>
<P>
   The 17th Breeders' Cup, a program of eight races for all ages
and specialties, will be held Nov. 4 at Churchill Downs in
Louisville, Ky., where western-prepped horses haven't done too well
on four previous occasions. One hundred days is plenty of time for
perceptions to change, for Californians to go on the road and
assert superiority (Captain Steve? Cat Thief? Dark Moondancer?
Happyanunoit? Honest Lady? Silic?) and for one notable California
idler to reemerge (Fusaichi Pegasus).
</P>
<P>
   But for now, California horses are playing catch-up.
</P>
<P>
   MORE FROM THE DEL MAR OPENER:
</P>
<P>
   -- This is God's way of saying you've won too many races: Owner
Bob Lewis told reporters after Duke of Green's Oceanside Stakes
victory Wednesday that ``this might be the first grass stakes we
(Lewis and his wife Beverly) have ever won.''
</P>
<P>
   He forgets that Twice the Vice gave the Lewises their very first
Grade I victory in the 1994 Del Mar Oaks, a turf race. Twice the
Vice was sold later that year to Martin and Pam Wygod.
</P>
<P>
   The Lewises' most memorable victories have come on the main
track, including Silver Charm's and Charismatic's Kentucky Derbies.
</P>
<P>
   -- Thank you for exposing the younger generation to horse
racing: Joe Harper joked that Wednesday was a ``family day'' in the
turf club. ``A lot of people brought their nieces,'' the
ever-quotable Del Mar boss said with a grin.
</P>
<P>
   -- A good-looking crowd in more ways than two: Del Mar reported
opening-day attendance of 31,494. That's the third-largest turnout
at the seaside track that Bing Crosby and Pat O'Brien founded in
1937.
</P>
<P>
   Del Mar publicists made sure to announce that Saratoga drew
27,810 to its Wednesday opener.
</P>
<P>
   -- The best-attended sports event in Los Angeles County took
place in San Diego County: The intertrack wagering facilities at
Hollywood Park, Santa Anita, Fairplex Park and the Lancaster
fairgrounds drew a combined 7,000 fans to bet on the televised Del
Mar races Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   -- Be careful not to set too high a standard: The ``News and
Notes'' page of the Del Mar program called the opening-day card
``something of a bettors' and racing secretary's dream'' because
``seven of the nine races have at least eight horses.''
</P>
<P>
   After scratches, the card included fields of five, seven, seven
and seven. Win payoffs included $3.40, $4.20, $4.40 and $5.
Somebody was dreaming, all right, but it wasn't the bettors or the
racing secretary.
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD ENDING: Hollywood Park management faced two big
decisions as its spring-summer season concluded Monday.
</P>
<P>
   One regarded the future of Friday-night racing, which slumped at
the turnstiles while sports fans were distracted by the Lakers'
NBA-championship run. The other had to do with the future of track
announcer Chris Kotulak, who never was going to make fans forget
Michael Wrona, the nation's best racecaller.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood Park president Rick Baedeker indicated last week that
the track might open next spring with a Friday night, then return
to afternoons until that second half of the meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether we go head to head with (Friday-night
playoff games) next year,'' Baedeker said. ``I think if we do,
we'll pretty much guarantee that there will be a (Lakers)
dynasty.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood Park blundered by letting Wrona get away to a contract
at Lone Star Park in Texas after the Inglewood track's fall 1999
season. Baedeker tried to downplay that error.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the moderate and certainly for the novice fan, I think
Michael is an impediment,'' he said of the Australian announcer,
whose calls, Baedeker apparently thinks, are too clever for
beginners.
</P>
<P>
   Kotulak, who came from Louisiana Downs, compensated for his
general blandness with more-than-occasional errors. But Baedeker
praised Kotulak for showing ``a lot of character'' amid criticism,
and said he'll be in the booth again at the fall meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect that when he comes back in the fall, the fans will
accept him,'' Baedeker said. He said track officials will
``continue to work with him.'' &QL;

 NAPSTER APPEALS FEDERAL COURT INJUNCTION  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As its fans threatened cyberspace unrest,
embattled Napster Inc. appealed Thursday a federal court injunction
that would disconnect the online music-swapping service at midnight
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The San Mateo startup asked the U.S. Court of Appeals in San
Francisco for an emergency stay of the preliminary injunction that
a federal judge ordered Wednesday. No hearing was immediately
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   If Napster is not granted a stay, said interim chief executive
Hank Barry, the company plans to shut down the service to comply
with U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel's order.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would essentially destroy Napster as a business and
deprive the more than 20 million Napster users of their service,''
Napster's attorneys said in their motion.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the ripples from the impending shutdown spread rapidly
throughout the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Napster's Web site was slowed to a crawl by fans seeking the
latest news and alternatives. According to Nielsen//NetRatings,
traffic to Napster's Web site increased about 56 percent since
Patel made her landmark copyright infringement ruling.
</P>
<P>
   And traffic to the Web site of a Napster alternative called
Scour has increased by 80 percent since last week.
</P>
<P>
   The more defiant Napster fans are calling for mass boycotts
against the record companies and general ``civil disobedience'' by
switching to decentralized file swapping programs like Gnutella and
Freenet. Neither is not controlled by a company that could be sued
by the record industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're engaged in here is cultural warfare,'' said John
Perry Barlow, co-founder and vice-chairman of the Internet civil
liberties group Electronic Frontier Foundation of San Francisco.
``This is a battle between the powers that were and the powers that
will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Patel agreed with members of the Recording Industry Association
of America, which complained that the Napster program violates
copyright laws by allowing people to swap free MP3-formatted copies
of music.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, Napster attorneys said they are
contesting Patel's ruling on several grounds, including claiming
that Patel ``wrongly stated that Napster users were engaged in
direct infringement'' and ``ignored substantial evidence that
Napster is helping, not hurting, the record industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Napster attorneys also said Patel's ruling ``extended copyright
law to cover new technologies, ignoring the counsel of the Supreme
Court that such extensions should be left to the Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Neil Rosini, a copyright law expert not connected with
the case, said he does not expect the appeal to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be very difficult for any judge to look at trading of
other people's copyrighted work without payment as being condoned
under copyright law,'' said Rosini, an attorney with Franklin,
Weinrib, Rudell &AMP; Vassallo of New York. Rosini also represents
Myplay.com Inc., a Redwood City Internet company that offers online
storage of MP3 songs.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the ruling stands, Napsterites say this is not the day
the music died. Tracy Bixler, 33, of Pennsylvania, wrote in an
e-mail that if Napster is shut down, ``I will look into other
programs that allow me the same capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Bixler said she bought only about five CDs last year, but since
finding new music with Napster, has already purchased about 70 this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Napster is technology, and the greedy RIAA and some of its
artists just can't stop it,'' Bixler said. ``There will always be
another way to find MP3s, and their best efforts aren't going to
change that. All this has accomplished is to make people more
determined than ever to find free music.''
</P>
<P>
   Napster's Web site took almost 70 seconds to access since the
ruling, compared to an average of 5 seconds earlier this week, said
Daniel Todd, director for public services of the Web monitoring
firm Keynote Services Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But to stay in business, Rosini said, Napster most likely will
be forced to reach a settlement with record companies and music
publishers that would allow some form of swapping to continue, but
still give money to artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the user base is so large and so valuable that
something will come of it,'' Rosini said.
</P>
<P>
   However, winning the preliminary injunction gives the recording
industry a powerful weapon to force Napster into a potentially
costly settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Recording Industry Association general counsel Cary Sherman said
Napster executives have informally approached individual record
companies with business plans that would appease both sides. But
now that the record industry has a court judgment in hand, Napster
must become more motivated to forge a settlement, Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
   Online music portal MP3.com Inc. lost a similar but unrelated
copyright suit against the record industry last month and is now
forced to set aside $150 million to cover settlement costs.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego company has agreed to pay $20 million each to
Warner Music Group and BMG Entertainment Inc. and has reportedly
agreed to a similar settlement with EMI.
</P>
<P>
   However, Napster, which received a $15 million investment from
Hummer Winblad Venture Partners, does not have the same financial
strength of MP3.com.
</P>
<P>
   And the preliminary injunction, if it stands, will prevent
Napster from attracting a higher number of users that could have
given the company the advantage in negotiations with the record
industry, said Steve Vonder Haar, senior Internet consultant with
the research firm Yankee Group.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Napster has the chance to reinvent itself by generating
revenues, through subscription fees or advertising, that would then
be used to pay licensing or royalty fees to the music industry,
Vonder Haar said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As ironic as it might seem, you could see Napster becoming a
valuable tool for the record labels themselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is unclear how many of Napster's 20 million users would
stick with the program if they no longer were able to download free
songs.

 GOV. DAVIS SEEKS REGULATOR INTERVENTION IN LOWERING POWER BILLS  &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis called Thursday for state regulators to seek
lower electricity rates amid a doubling of power bills in San
Diego, the first California city to feel the full effects of energy
deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   He also urged the state Public Utilities Commission, which is
slated to discuss soaring electricity charges next week, to ``take
all actions necessary to assure that electricity supplies are
adequate and that prices paid by California consumers are just and
reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   As The Chronicle reported Thursday, average power bills in San
Diego have soared from about $55 to $103 during the past three
months as the local utility, San Diego Gas and Electric Co., passes
along its rising wholesale costs to ratepayers.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Gas and Electric Co. said the same situation could occur
in Northern California when an electricity rate freeze is lifted
here, perhaps as soon as next year.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer activists and politicians at all levels have been
calling on Davis to take steps to relieve the sticker shock among
San Diego ratepayers and ease the impact of deregulation statewide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Californians are willing to pay their fair share of the cost
for a reliable supply of electricity, but I believe the current
situation is unjust and totally unacceptable,'' the governor said
in a statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that that state's 1996 deregulation bill promised
consumers that they would pay ``stable, if not reduced, prices.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is clearly not the case in California,'' Davis said.
``The result is uncontrolled price spikes with no end in sight.''
</P>
<P>
   He called on the California Independent System Operator, the
nonprofit agency that oversees electricity flow throughout the
state, to apply to federal regulators for an extension of its
authority to establish wholesale price caps.
</P>
<P>
   These caps are set to expire in November unless the ISO &LR; 
 &LR; Independent System Operator requests an extension.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Winter, chief executive of the Independent System
Operator, said his organization already was planning to apply for
an extension. But he said he was pleased that the governor has
taken an interest in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Independent Service Operator iSO  &LR; cut
California's power price cap to $500 per megawatt hour from $750.
The ISO &LR; It is expected to lower the cap even further to $250 at its
next meeting on August 1.
</P>
<P>
   Power generators are fighting such moves, arguing that price
caps are contrary to the spirit of deregulation and discourage
energy companies from investing in new power plants.
</P>
<P>
   In a move almost sure to draw the wrath of power companies,
Davis called on the state PUC Public Utilities Commission  &LR; and the
state Electricity Oversight Board to ask federal regulators to rule
that California does not have a competitive energy market.
</P>
<P>
   Such a determination would allow the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission to set ``just and reasonable'' rates for California
electricity users, which would almost certainly be lower than
current ones. rates. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  However, if federal authorities determine that the state's
energy market is indeed competitive, current market rates would
continue.
</P>
<P>
   Loretta Lynch, the PUC president, said she is glad that Davis is
coordinating unified actions among state agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy that California is speaking with one voice,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her commission is scheduled to take up the matter of
skyrocketing San Diego electricity bills at its meeting next
Thursday, but the only proposal on the table, in essence,
encourages the PUC to allow deregulation to run its course.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Davis asked Lynch to facilitate the return of $100
million in refunds to San Diego ratepayers. SDG&AMP;E &LR; San Diego Gas and
Electric already has said it is working to return the money,
amassed through the sale of its generating assets, to customers.
</P>
<P>
   Nettie Hoge, executive director of the Utility Reform Network in
San Francisco, said she was heartened to see the governor taking
the initiative in relieving the impact of energy deregulation on
utility customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great that he's using the bully pulpit,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hoge said that most of Davis' recommendations concern
developments that are already under way and that the governor is
not breaking much new ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's said anything bold here,'' Hoge said. ``But
Davis is on the right track. Everyone should now rally around
him.''

 HOUSE VOTES TO REPEAL TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY EARNINGS  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Capping a summer GOP drive to pass a string of
popular tax cuts and put Democrats on the defensive, the House of
Representatives voted Thursday to repeal a 1993 tax increase on
Social Security benefits for 10 million seniors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're playing good fourth-quarter ball,'' conceded Rep. Mike
Thompson, D-Napa, of his Republican colleagues. ``Whether or not it
will do them any good is another question.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans crowed about the 265-to-159 vote to roll back what
they derided as the ``Gore tax,'' an increase in taxes on Social
Security benefits for middle- and upper-income seniors that cleared
the Senate in 1993 only by Vice President Al Gore's tie-breaking
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are repealing that Gore tax,'' said Republican whip Tom
DeLay, R-Texas, at an event staged on the western steps of the
Capitol to highlight the GOP's rapid-fire accomplishments of the
past three weeks. ``We are more concerned about seniors than they
ever thought about.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House furiously lobbied Democrats to hold firm,
successfully holding the vote count below the threshold needed to
override President Clinton's promised veto.
</P>
<P>
   Still, 52 Democrats, including Walnut Creek's Ellen Tauscher,
Santa Barbara's Lois Capps and Merced's Gary Condit, crossed party
lines to vote for the repeal, which has proven immensely popular
among seniors in members' districts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said he will veto the measure, which was part of his
1993 deficit-cutting package that he frequently boasts is one of
his administration's proudest accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   East Bay Democratic Rep. Pete Stark said the tax rollback would
be ``a gift to the very rich,'' because it would not benefit the
bulk of seniors, who do not pay the highest rate.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1993 tax increase, senior couples earning more than
$44,000 a year and singles earning more than $34,000 are taxed on
85 percent of their Social Security benefits, up from 50 percent
before.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of TAXES28 (665 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The House legislation would roll that share back to 50 percent;
the estimated 10-year cost to the Treasury is $100 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans argued that with budget surpluses rolling in, it is
time to repeal a tax increase intended to reduce a deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The choice is clear,'' Delay said, ``Return the surplus to the
people ... or let the president spend it on Washington programs.''
</P>
<P>
   House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas,
declared, ``Social Security checks should not arrive in the mailbox
with a bill from the IRS attached. It's unfair, it's unnecessary,
and it harms the retirement security of millions of Americans now
and in the years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   As they have with other GOP tax cuts, Democrats again attempted
to offer their own whittled-down alternative intended to benefit
lower-income seniors. They again were rebuffed by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``You bet we can do tax cuts,'' said House Democratic leader
Richard Gephardt of Missouri. ``We can even do a big piece of this
tax cut if we don't give it to the high rollers.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure has not passed the Senate, but Republicans there
said the bill could be included in year-end tax legislation.
</P>
<P>
   It comes on top of legislation Clinton signed last spring that
repealed the so-called earnings limitation on Social Security
benefits. Seniors now can earn as much outside income as they want
without losing Social Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has promised to veto all the new GOP tax cuts, many of
which got strong and even overwhelming Democratic support,
including ``marriage penalty'' tax relief, repeal of the estate
tax, repeal of the 3 percent telephone excise tax, expansion of
401(k) and IRA tax-deferred savings accounts and other measures.
</P>
<P>
   The measures are pieces of a $792 billion tax cut that
Republicans passed last summer. It was swiftly vetoed by Clinton
and got virtually no political traction, as Democrats derided it as
a bloated budget-buster favoring the rich.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of TAXES28 (665 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  But House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., regrouped, hitting upon
a simple but effective counterplay: Push through the most popular
elements of the big package and dare Democrats to vote against
them.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Democratic leaders have repeated the same charges
against the piecemeal tax cuts, accusing Republicans of favoring
handouts to the rich. Gephardt said the accumulated revenue losses
of the individual tax cuts that have cleared the House approach the
cost of last year's $792 billion package.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats have been forced to devise their own alternatives
_ even proposing major reductions in such Republican hobbyhorses as
the estate tax _ that would have been unthinkable two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And Democrats have signed on wholeheartedly to other tax cuts,
such as the 3 percent phone tax repeal and expansion of IRA and
401(k) retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, a man and woman dressed as a bride and groom driving a
car with streamers and tin cans delivered the Republican tax cut
for married couples to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart derided the stunt, saying the
GOP measure should be renamed, ``Who Wants to Help a Millionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   Napa's Thompson said Republicans are more interested in creating
an election year issue than actually enacting tax cuts. The votes
provide the GOP with ammunition in tight House races as well as in
the presidential contest, he said, where Republicans can tell
voters that Democrats are standing in the way of tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have been aided by swiftly expanding budget surplus
projections, which they said buttress their arguments that some of
the federal surplus should be returned to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security tax rollback was the last major action
before the House recessed for August and the Republican National
Convention. At the Philadelphia convention next week, the party
will rally around its standard-bearer, Texas Gov. George W. Bush,
who has made an across-the-board cut in income tax a centerpiece of
his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans dropped plans, however, to pass a modest tax-cut and
spending package agreed to in a House-Senate compromise that
included repeal of the 3 percent telephone excise tax. The bill was
hammered out during all-night meetings and survived a procedural
vote, but was dropped after it became clear that the Senate would
be unable to take it up. The Senate has been embroiled for weeks in
a partisan gridlock that has slowed action in that chamber.

STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL RULES QUACKENBUSH FOUNDATIONS ILLEGAL
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Former Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush
acted illegally when he set up nonprofit foundations to settle what
were alleged to be insurance companies' violations arising from the
Northridge earthquake, the state attorney general said in a formal
opinion released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The opinion by Attorney General Bill Lockyer may add weight to
the criminal investigation of Quackenbush and his activities at the
department and help earthquake victims recover money either through
lawsuits or reopened claims.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before legislative hearings earlier this year,
Quackenbush and his top lawyer at the department had insisted that
the establishment of the foundations was legal. Quackenbush later
resigned to avoid almost certain impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opinion, I believe, makes it very clear for all of us that
the conduct of the insurance commissioner was illegal,'' said state
Sen. Jackie Speier, D-Hillsborough, who requested the opinion. ``He
did not have the authority to make those settlements or request or
demand that money be contributed to foundations.''
</P>
<P>
   During the legislative inquiry, department officials testified
that they had recommended that insurance companies pay hundreds of
millions of dollars in fines. Instead, Quackenbush permitted the
companies to pay $13 million into nonprofit foundations, most of
which went to commercials featuring the commissioner and other
political activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us had a sense of disbelief, incredulity and outrage
that much of the activity going on in the Department of Insurance
was in (Quackenbush's) belief legal,'' Speier said. ``We now have
evidence that it was not legal, it was not politics as usual _ it
was downright wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The opinion by Lockyer states that although the insurance
commissioner has authority to set up foundations, their purpose
must be directly tied to the enforcement action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commissioner may not include a term of a settlement
requiring payment of funds to a private charitable foundation for
the purpose of supporting activities unrelated to the regulatory
enforcement responsibilities of the Department of Insurance in the
proceeding,'' the opinion states.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush's lawyer said the former commissioner took the legal
advice he was given.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything he did with the settlements was based on legal
advice,'' said Sacramento attorney Donald Heller. ``He acted in
good faith. He was told that he was acting appropriately and
lawfully.''
</P>
<P>
   Heller said Quackenbush used the foundations for outreach, which
is part of his statutory obligation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are additional facts that might change the
conclusion of the opinion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockyer said in Los Angeles that the opinion took time because
there was no legal precedent to build on.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The opinion) clearly outlines that the insurance commissioner
has some serious limitations on his ability to direct settlement
monies to private, nonprofit foundations,'' Lockyer said.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how much weight the opinion will have in the
continuing state and federal criminal investigations. Lockyer has
confirmed that a federal grand jury is hearing evidence in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not in any way binding on the court, but it might be a
signal that the attorney general thinks a crime was committed,''
said Michael Vitiello, a law professor at the University of the
Pacific's McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento. ``What has to
happen next in federal court is that (Quackenbush) must be indicted
by a grand jury. The state attorney general's view on a violation
of state law is irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Vitiello said, ``This can't be good news for
Quackenbush.''
</P>
<P>
   With the legal authority to create the settlements now in doubt,
Speier said she believes that the Department of Insurance should
reopen its examinations of the insurance companies' handling of
claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those settlements are void, and you always have the right to
set aside void acts,'' Speier said. ``I think the new insurance
commissioner should reopen the negotiations with the insurance
companies, reopen the market-conduct exams and reopen the
possibility of fines.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark Kelso, a law professor, has been acting insurance
commissioner since Quackenbush resigned. In a brief statement, he
said Thursday that the opinion ``raises complex legal issues'' and
that he will consult with Lockyer on the full implications of the
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis said he will appoint a permanent successor to
Quackenbush next week. The nominee, who must be confirmed by the
Legislature, will serve out Quackenbush's term through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The market-conduct exams _ sensitive audits detailing insurers'
alleged claims-handling violations after the Northridge earthquake
in 1994 _ have been at the center of the allegations surrounding
Quackenbush.
</P>
<P>
   The documents say state regulators found that some insurance
companies had a tendency to lowball policyholder claims and delay
payments.
</P>
<P>
   Victims may not directly receive restitution even after this
ruling, Speier acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The insurance commissioner generally cannot get restitution,''
she said. ``But there is the right to fine and order companies to
reopen claims. I think there is a strong opportunity to have claims
reopened.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, several lawsuits have been filed on behalf of
Northridge victims and taxpayers, demanding a return of the money.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Kronland, a San Francisco lawyer representing taxpayers,
said Lockyer's opinion will be ``very helpful to us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it supports the same theory that we are arguing _ that
the commissioner did not have the authority to put the money not in
the general fund, but in private funds used for political
purposes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But representatives of the insurance companies said Thursday
that the money paid to the foundations was not related to the
market-conduct exams and that no fines are warranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our voluntary participation in (the foundation) was not a part
of the market-conduct survey,'' said Bill Sirola, a spokesman for
State Farm. ``It was for what we think is a very important
scientific study of earthquake damage assessment on residential
buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   Sirola said State Farm has responded to the market-conduct exams
and maintains its position.
</P>
<P>
   ``We paid no fine, and we will pay no fine,'' he said. ``We
still have a claims office in Northridge, and we continue to say
that any policyholder who feels they have problem should recontact
us.''

 HATE CRIMES RISE IN CALIFORNIA AFTER YEARS OF DECLINE  &HT;     By STACY FINZ 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
After years on the decline, hate crimes in California rose by 12.1
percent last year, according to statistics released Thursday by the
California Department of Justice.
<P>
   Until 1999, most hate crimes appeared to be falling. In 1998,
there were 1,750 hate crimes reported in California, with a 7.6
percent drop in attacks based on race, ethnicity, sexual
orientation or religion from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, the total number jumped to 1,962 with more than
60 percent of the offenses motivated by race or ethnicity,
according to the Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each hate crime is an attack on a human being's personal
identity or beliefs,'' state Attorney General Bill Lockyer said in
a statement. ``This latest hate crime report unfortunately shows
that while we live in one of the most diverse places on the planet,
there is still ugly intolerance and violence focused against people
who are different.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Bernstein, director of the Anti-Defamation League for
the Central Pacific region, said not only are the numbers of
concern, but the severity of some of last year's events are
horrifying.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the state was rocked by a shooting rampage at a Los
Angeles-area Jewish center, injuring a woman, a teenager and three
young boys and finally ending with the death of a Filipino mail
carrier. A month earlier, a gay couple was killed in their home
near Redding. And in June, three Sacramento synagogues were
torched. Authorities have said that the crimes were fueled by
hatred and racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think last year's high-profile attacks contributed to the
rise in numbers,'' Bernstein said. ``There were copycats and public
awareness about the incidents probably contributed to more
reporting.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockyer said efforts are being made to make the public more
aware of the importance of reporting crimes motivated by racism or
hatred.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of HATECRIM (61169 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``Anyone familiar with hate crime reporting knows there still is
a problem of underreporting of incidents,'' Lockyer said. ``This is
a major issue being tackled by the Attorney General's Civil Rights
Commission on Hate Crimes. The commission is hearing
recommendations from local communities in forums throughout the
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein said while the numbers fluctuate from year to year,
there is no question in his mind that hate crimes have become more
violent and the perpetrators are younger than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to teach more tolerance in the schools,'' he said.
``Police agencies also need to be educated and they need to educate
their communities.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the hate crime report:
</P>
<P>
   --Violent crimes last year accounted for more than 67 percent of
the incidents.
</P>
<P>
   --Race or ethnicity was the motivation for 1,173 crimes, sexual
orientation for 436 attacks and religion for 338 incidents.
</P>
<P>
   --Hate crimes occurred at a home or in a driveway nearly 31
percent of the time or on a highway, street, alley or sidewalk 26.2
percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   -- Prosecutors filed 372 hate crime complaints last year, with
nearly 62 percent resulting in convictions.

 RAW SEWAGE SPILLS INTO MERCED RIVER AT EDGE OF YOSEMITE  &HT;     By GLEN MARTIN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A huge sewage spill has contaminated the Merced
River below Yosemite National Park at the height of the summer
tourist season, forcing a health advisory urging local residents
and visitors to stay out of the water.
</P>
<P>
   About 200,000 gallons of raw sewage poured into the Merced
Thursday between 6:30 a.m. and 7:15 a.m. from a new sewer line that
runs between the park and a sewage treatment plant at El Portal, a
hamlet just outside the park's boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   The spill occurred during tests to determine the condition of
the line, said park spokeswoman Christine Cowles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sewer line became clogged when we were running the tests,
probably with material that fell in during recent construction on
Highway 140,'' said Cowles, referring to a road that runs along the
river and is a popular route to the park.
</P>
<P>
   Cowles said about 60 percent of the spill was freshwater, the
rest untreated sewage. The amount of water and sewage that spilled
would have filled about 25 tanker trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were running the lines at 100 percent of capacity,'' Cowles
said. ``Under normal conditions, the (flow) is usually at 50
percent (capacity) or less.''
</P>
<P>
   Park officials immediately posted advisories along five miles of
river frontage downstream of the spill site, directing people to
stay away from the water until tests indicate fecal coliform
bacteria have fallen to safe levels.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of YOSEMITE (109839 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Cowles said the National Park Service is working with Mariposa
County and the Regional Water Quality Control Board to monitor
bacteria levels. ``We're recommending no contact for at least 24
hours,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bacteria test results from samples of river water taken after
the spill are not expected to be available until Friday, Cowles
said.
</P>
<P>
   The spill could not have occurred at a worst time. Yosemite's
tourist season is in full swing, and guests who stay at the large
hotels in El Portal often cool off by taking dips in the pools of
the normally pristine Sierra Nevada river.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is also  &LR; exacerbated by the river's low summer
flows.
</P>
<P>
   Bacterial contamination is dissipated more quickly by high
volumes of water. Thursday, the Merced's flow was about 150 cubic
feet a second; springtime flows on the river can sometimes &LR;   &LR; exceed
10,000 cubic feet per second.
</P>
<P>
   Although the levels of fecal coliform bacteria are expected to
fall off fairly quickly, other hazards associated with the spill
may last longer, health officials warned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fecal coliform bacteria are easy to monitor, but it's
impossible to monitor for pathogenic viruses such as those
associated with hepatitis and a variety of gastrointestinal
diseases without some pretty sophisticated equipment,'' said Dave
Spath, chief of drinking water and environmental management for the
California Department of Health Services.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of YOSEMITE (109839 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``That's why viral monitoring typically isn't done (after a
spill),'' Spath said. ``The problem is that viral agents tend to
hang around longer than (coliform bacteria), particularly if the
water is pretty cold, as I assume it still is in the Merced.''
</P>
<P>
   Spath said a 200,000-gallon spill translates into a significant
recreational health risk, ``particularly because it was raw sewage
only diluted by about a one-to-one ratio. People shouldn't swim or
wade in the river until it's clear that it's safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisheries and wildlife can be affected by heavy sewage spills.
Fish kills, in particular, are common. But no dead fish had been
reported yet in the Merced, Cowles said. The river supports a good
trout fishery.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Yosemite's sewer lines have sullied
the Merced _ but that doesn't mean there is anything inherently
inadequate about the system, Cowles said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some spills last year, but they were also
associated with tests,'' said Cowles. ``We don't have any doubts
about the basic soundness of the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Some environmentalists said the spill is one of many indications
that Yosemite and its environs are overbuilt, threatening the
natural beauty and biological integrity of the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very significant event, and it points out that we
need less development in Yosemite and the surrounding area,'' said
Janet Cobb, president of the Yosemite Restoration Trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us want to be close to the river and appreciate it, but
we need to be mindful of the impact our activities have on it,''
Cobb said.

REVISITING CRUZ, THREE YEARS LATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ When did you finally feel comfortable as a Toronto
Blue Jay?
</P>
<P>
   ``This season,'' said Jose Cruz Jr.
</P>
<P>
   As Monday's trading deadline approaches, with the slavering
hordes itchy for the Mariners to bust a move, it is instructive to
hear from a chunk of meat what it felt like almost three years ago
to have become a chunk of meat.
</P>
<P>
   ``My world,'' he said, ``flipped upside down.''
</P>
<P>
   He could have said the lights went out on his world, but that is
more appropriate to ridiculously overpriced baseball stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz, one-time darling of the Mariners farm system, only
recently has gotten over being swapped July 31, 1997, for relief
pitchers Mike Timlin and Paul Spoljaric.
</P>
<P>
   Middle of the game in Milwaukee. Getting ready to bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Son, come over here,'' Cruz recalled manager Lou Piniella
saying. ``And bring your glove.''
</P>
<P>
   In the clubhouse, he got the word from assistant general manager
Lee Pelekoudas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' he said before starting Thursday
night's game in left field against the Mariners. ``I was ...
bewildered. It really didn't set in until the guys came over to the
hotel room to say their good-byes.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-nine games into what he, the Mariners and most of their
fans figured to be a long, decorous solution to the chronic
franchise problem of left field, Cruz was adrift in midseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just started to feel good in the city, knowing where things
were,'' he said. ``I had friends, I was comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I just got my cable TV hooked up.''
</P>
<P>
   Many can relate to that epochal achievement. There are pockets
of Puget Sound where cable hookups happen slightly less quickly
than whale gestation.
</P>
<P>
   For Cruz, however, not only was there no one to share the
majesty of the triumph, he now had to unhook the cable.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is no obligation on the part of fans to feel sorry for
Cruz, or any of his uprooted brethren. Whether in Seattle or
Toronto, Cruz remains a major league ballplayer, a form of living
exceeded in previous times by only sheiks, emperors and the minor
deities.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz, 26, is fully aware of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big part of my goal was to be a major league ballplayer,''
he said. ``That's still true.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as with anyone when a dream is kinked, Cruz was hurt, a
little irked and helpless when his fate was rearranged beyond his
control. He fancied himself as a Mariner in the Kingdome almost
from the time he was taken in the first round of the 1995 major
league draft from Rice University.
</P>
<P>
   As the son of a major leaguer who played 13 seasons with one
team, the Houston Astros, the notion of baseball vagabond was not
prominent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone taken by an organization sees himself with them the
whole time,'' he said. ``Sure, you know it's a business, but that
isn't what you think about. You make friends, you think about
playing with them in the majors. Suddenly you're ripped away, going
to a place that you know nothing about, and don't know anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only did I go from West to East, I went from America to
Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   In major league sports, young players are rarely given the
courtesy of a heads-up, much less a choice. In the week prior to
the trade, then-general manager Woody Woodward declared flatly that
the popular youngster would not be traded. So Cruz relaxed a bit,
only to be bushwhacked.
</P>
<P>
   Although the deal was condemned at the time, relievers Timlin
and Spoljaric did help the Mariners reach the 1997 playoffs with a
club-record, 90-win season. But as Baltimore demonstrated in its
3-1 division-series triumph, the '97 team was far from a serious
challenger. Both pitchers eventually were traded.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, Cruz has not rivaled the aurora borealis in the
Canadian sky. He has yet to return to his rookie-year Seattle
production levels, when he hit .268 with 12 home runs and 34 RBIs
in 49 games.
</P>
<P>
   He hit .231 the rest of that season in Toronto. In 105 games in
'98, he hit .253, and .241 in 106 games in '99, with stretches in
Class AAA both years. This year he has played every game, hitting
.233 with 21 homers and 49 RBIs. He still struggles with off-speed
pitches. Although improving, he remains a least-likely candidate
for a Gold Glove.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz professes no disillusionment with baseball, but can't avoid
wondering, along with Seattle fans, what would have been. It
doesn't appear he will become the glamorous star forecast by some.
But perhaps a dozen clubs would be willing to take a chance on him
if the Blue Jays figure a trade would give them a shot to stay with
the Yankees in an up-for-grabs year in the American League.
</P>
<P>
   Having experienced the nature of the commodities market
personally, his world likely would not again be flippable. But as
most ordinary folks can tell him, neither is there joy in spending
a valued portion of one's life waiting for the cable guy.

FRENCH `FANATIQUES' KNOW U.S. WAY OFF TRACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the Web site of the often-droll French sports daily,
``L'Equipe,'' news of our Olympic stupidity predictably failed to
go unnoticed this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnson, Greene disparu!'' Yes, they certainly did.
</P>
<P>
   And I have this vision of sports fanatiques, throughout ``la
belle France,'' perusing the dispatches from Sacramento and
wondering, ``And these guys defeated the Germans?''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, yes, we will be sending a track and field team to
Sydney without either the reigning world champion or the world
record holder in the men's 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on our democratic society. Blame it on the lawyers.
Blame it on too many hours of Nintendo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the world's No. 1 track and field team,'' Craig
Masback, the chief executive officer of USA Track and Field,
repeated _ more than once _ during last week's Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
   And by the glare of the rented spotlight that USATF enjoyed for
10 days in California's Central Valley, it was hard to argue. The
infatuated Sacramento fans cheered for 9.93 sprinters and 26-foot
long jumpers alike.
</P>
<P>
   Masback based his ``No. 1'' claim on previous results at the
Olympics, the 1998 World Cup and the '99 World Championships of
Track and Field, when the first eight places are scored as a normal
U.S. track meet. Which they aren't, of course, but Masback was
getting so much ink in the Sacramento paper last week, the trials
became a tent revival, of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   He was selling. And lots of folks _ NBC, Nike, the city of
Sacramento, which wants the trials again in '04 _ apparently were
buying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll have a good team in Sydney,'' said U.S. men's
team assistant coach Bubba Thornton, head coach at Texas and a
native of Keller.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a good mix of the old and new.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet I think Thornton is only half-right. The team that was
selected in Sacramento does have an intriguing blend of old and
new. But the new faces, as well as some of the old ones, are yet
unproven.
</P>
<P>
   With seven weeks to go before the Sydney Games, this figures to
be the weakest track and field team that the United States has sent
to an Olympics in 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. men's team at Montreal in 1976 won only one individual
running event _ Edwin Moses' victory in the 400-meter hurdles. The
American women won no events, track or field. The other five men's
gold medals came in the decathlon (Bruce Jenner), long jump (Arnie
Robinson), discus (Mac Wilkins) and both relays.
</P>
<P>
   Can this U.S. men's team win six golds in Sydney?
</P>
<P>
   As Michael Johnson and Maurice Greene reminded the Sacramento
tent faithful last weekend, don't count your chickens, even if you
think they're tape-delayed.
</P>
<P>
   Greene is the world's fastest ever at 100 meters, but his
inconsistency was underscored in Sacramento. His fastest race was
his first, a 9.93-second 100 meters in the prelims, and he was
pushed to the tape in his first 200-meter heat.
</P>
<P>
   Greene's running mates in the Sydney 100 meters will be TCU ex
Jon Drummond and Curtis Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Drummond is a veteran with solid credentials, but the fact that
he competed so well in Sacramento will send an encouraging message
to the sprinters in Jamaica, Nigeria and Canada. Curtis Johnson, on
the other hand, was once eighth in the U.S. championships and has
never been ranked in the world's top 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``In just about every event, across the board, we have new
upstarts along with seasoned veterans,'' argued '76 Olympic
medal-winner Fred Newhouse, who will serve as manager of the U.S.
team in Australia. ``And I think that's absolutely wonderful news
for this country.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, but when people sit down to watch the Olympics on NBC,
they don't want to hear about the rebuilding program _ they want to
see Americans beating Russians, Germans, Canadians, et al., to the
finish line.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Johnson, still splendid at 400 meters, should do that.
Allen Johnson, likewise, remains the best 110-meter high hurdler on
the planet. And young Angelo Taylor may well carry on Moses' golden
tradition in the 400 hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   But in front of an expected rowdy Aussie crowd of mates and
sheilas, the Americans won't have the homefield advantage that they
enjoyed in Atlanta. The 13 gold medals won in '96 and the 12 in '92
seem a distant possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Changing the system of picking the U.S. teams would help. But
the enduring appeal of the Olympic trials lie in the all-or-nothing
drama. It isn't likely to change, especially now that the CEO
recognizes it as a showcase event, a chance to strut and to finally
draw a countable TV audience.
</P>
<P>
   But we're No. 1?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not this time. It's a rebuilding year.

MOTHER CONVICTED OF KILLING FOUR DAUGHTERS IN FIRE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOLLY EDWARDS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FERNANDO, Calif. _ After deliberating just five hours, a
jury found Sandi Dawn Nieves guilty of murdering her four young
daughters and trying to murder her teen-age son in a 1998 arson at
their home in northern Los Angeles County.
</P>
<P>
   Nieves, wearing a dark-green jacket and skirt, hid her face with
a piece of paper and two jurors wiped away tears as the judge
pronounced her guilty Thursday of four counts of first-degree
murder with special circumstances, as well as attempted murder and
arson charges. The same jury that convicted her will determine
whether she should get the death penalty or spend the rest of her
life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   After the verdicts were read, the stepmother of two of the girls
read a statement on behalf of the family outside the Superior Court
in the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hearts go out to all the children in this country who are
used by one of their parents to seek revenge on their ex-spouses to
manipulate and to hurt one another,'' said Charlotte Nieves, who
was flanked by Sandi Nieves' ex-husbands, Fernando Nieves and Dave
Folden.
</P>
<P>
   ``These girls had to pay with their lives because their mother
did the unspeakable act of killing them.''
</P>
<P>
   Family members were not allowed to speak extensively about the
verdict, however, because they are expected to testify during the
penalty phase of the trial, which is scheduled to begin Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say Sandi Nieves was seeking revenge against her two
ex-husbands and an ex-boyfriend July 1, 1998, when she lured the
girls into the kitchen of her Seco Canyon home for a slumber party.
She set gasoline-fueled fires throughout the house, then called 911
to say she could not awaken them.
</P>
<P>
   Sandi Nieves and David, her son from her first marriage, were
hospitalized for smoke inhalation. The boy testified against his
mother.
</P>
<P>
   During the three-month trial, Deputy Public Defender Howard Waco
tried to paint Sandi Nieves, 36, as a woman emotionally destroyed
by child custody and boyfriend problems. He has said she still has
no memory of the fire that killed Jaqlene Marie Folden, 5; Kristl
Dawn Folden, 7; Rashel Hollie Nieves, 11; and Nikolet Amber Nieves,
12.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorry for the jury because they didn't hear the case I
hoped to present,'' Waco said, referring to numerous objections
that interrupted his presentation. ``The jury may feel cheated
later on.''
</P>
<P>
   Waco said he would appeal the verdict, but acknowledged there is
a slim chance that it would be overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said they were gratified by the jury's verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a relief to hear those words after two years and a lot of
work,'' said Deputy District Attorney Beth Silverman, in tears
after the verdict was read. ``You live and breathe these kind of
cases.''
</P>
<P>
   After the verdict was read and the jury of five women and seven
men was escorted from the building, Waco asked Judge Jeffrey Wiatt
for permission to delay penalty arguments for a week to allow Sandi
Nieves' out-of-state family members time to get into town.
</P>
<P>
   When the judge denied the request, Sandi Nieves muttered, ``He
doesn't care.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard what you said, Ms. Nieves, and anything you say in
court can be used against you,'' Wiatt responded.
</P>
<P>
   Waco also asked the judge to arrange special transportation for
the defendant from the jail to court because she has been
`'verbally and physically abused'' by other inmates on the bus.
</P>
<P>
   However, Waco said such arrangements must be made through the
Sheriff's Department.

THIS TEAM REALLY STEPS UP TO THE PLATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM CAPLE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Lance Armstrong's body-fat percentage is approximately
that of an aluminum bike frame. Michael Jordan is 6 feet, 6 inches
of lean, tapered muscle. Marion Jones looks like she just walked
out of a Tae-Bo workout videotape.
</P>
<P>
   Don't you just hate them?
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of baseball, though, is that even in this
androstenedione-charged world of personal trainers, you can have a
body like Kirby Puckett, Tony Gwynn or David Wells and still be
among the best players in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, today's ballplayers increasingly look like they were
sculpted by Rodin. But fortunately, there still is room for the
more distinctively built players, the ones who provide hope to
every couch potato. The ones who are built, well, like
sportswriters.
</P>
<P>
   That's why we've come up with this All-Star team of players who
make us all feel a little better when we step on the scales. We're
thinking of players such as Kent Hrbek, whose idea of
cross-training was riding the stationary bike while eating a Dove
bar. Or former Philadelphia first baseman John Kruk, who epitomized
what our All-Star team is all about when he once told a woman,
``Lady, I'm not an athlete, I'm a ballplayer.''
</P>
<P>
   We had only two criteria in selecting this team. One, the player
was never a candidate to sashay down a Milan catwalk modeling
Versace's latest spring line. And two, he had to be good. Every
player on this team played in an All-Star Game or was a key member
of a title-winning team.
</P>
<P>
   Say what you will about these guys, they're ballplayers.
</P>
<P>
   Starting pitcher: There's a lot of competition here. There was
Mickey Lolich, who didn't let his weight prevent him from regularly
pitching 300 innings a season (he fittingly opened a donut shop
after his retirement from baseball). And there was Jim Bibby, who
was large enough that a pitching coach said he pitched Bibby on an
especially windy day because he knew Bibby couldn't be blown off
the mound.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, we go with Toronto's Cy Young candidate David
Wells, who pitched a perfect game in 1998 and who has five more
wins this season than that Boston beanpole, Pedro Martinez. The
competition was close, but what puts Wells over the top is his
trademark unbuttoned jersey _ and the time he showed up to spring
training with a case of gout.
</P>
<P>
   Relief pitcher: Could there be anyone else for this spot other
than Terry Forster, the man David Letterman labeled the Fat Tub of
Goo? Forster took the kidding in good humor _ when he appeared on
the show later, he showed up with his clothes stuffed with food.
Years later, some of his ex-teammates still refer to him as
``Goo.''
</P>
<P>
   First base: So many players, so many choices. There's George
Scott and Boog Powell, Mo Vaughn and Hrbek. But in the end, we went
with Kruk, who always looked right at home on a ballfield _ a
softball field.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 21, 1990, the Phillies were losing 11-1 in Los Angeles
in the eighth inning, and the game was dragging on so long that
Kruk grew upset because ``we weren't going to get back to the hotel
in time for room service.'' But the Phillies rallied to win the
game, inspiring this gem from our hero: ``If you're going to miss
room service, you might as well win.''
</P>
<P>
   Second base: Carlos Baerga. He was one the best hitters in the
American League in the early '90s, even though he showed up to
spring training each year looking a bit too much like the Michelin
Man.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop: Kevin Mitchell. Sure, Mitch was relatively trim when
he played shortstop briefly with the Mets, but the former MVP makes
the team on his body of work over a long career, which included
missing a couple of games when he pulled a muscle while throwing
up.
</P>
<P>
   The man would eat anything, including this odd, cold recipe.
Rather than spread it on his body, he said he ate Vick's VapoRub.
</P>
<P>
   Third base: Bob Horner. Big Bob Horner, who ruled the hot
corner, had a clause in his contract with Atlanta that paid him
$100,000 if he weighed 215 pounds or less every Friday home game.
Horner later played for the Cardinals. When asked what he liked
best about St. Louis, he replied, ``Frosted beer mugs (in the
clubhouse.)''
</P>
<P>
   Outfield: Greg Luzinski. A member of the 250-250 club (250
pounds, 250 home runs), the Bull played alongside Philadelphia
center fielder Garry Maddox, of whom it was said, ``Water covers
two-thirds of the earth, Maddox covers the rest.'' By the end of
his career, when he was at his uniform-challenging peak, the same
was true of Luzinski.
</P>
<P>
   Outfield: Babe Ruth. The Granddaddy of Poundage, Ruth began his
career as a relatively trim pitcher but became the most popular
sports figure of his day when he bulked up into the Sultan of Swat.
Perhaps the greatest player in the game's history, Ruth had such a
legendary appetite that when he was hospitalized in 1925 with an
intestinal abcess (``the bellyache heard 'round the world'') the
popular legend (perhaps untrue) was he had overindulged in too many
hot dogs and too much soda pop.
</P>
<P>
   Outfield: Matt Stairs. What a beauty. The natural heir to the
Kruk legacy of ballplayers, Stairs is a fire hydrant of a man who
played for the Canadian Olympic team, loves pro wrestling and paid
his dues with seven years in the minors and a season in Japan
before developing into one of the league's top power threats with
Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   You've got to love this guy. Commenting on his physique, Stairs
once said that since everyone said he had a beer-league swing, it
makes sense to have a ``beer-league body.''
</P>
<P>
   Catcher: It's tempting to go with someone named Pudge, but both
Carlton Fisk and Ivan Rodriguez are a little too solid for this
team. However, Pittsburgh's Mike LaValliere, a Gold Glover, made a
nice target behind home plate by the end of his career, spreading
some 225 pounds over his 5-foot-9 frame. Plus, you've got to love a
guy nicknamed Spanky.
</P>
<P>
   Designated hitter: There are many to choose from, but the nod
goes to Cecil Fielder. After he hit a massive home run in spring
training 1990 (his 50-homer season), one pitcher said he could hear
Fielder rattling his chains in the on-deck circle. A Twins
infielder went further than that in 1996 when Big Cecil finally
stole his first base, saying he could ``hear him coming'' down the
basepath.
</P>
<P>
   Manager: Tommy Lasorda. Pre-Slim Fast days, of course.

ERSTAD ON PACE FOR YET ANOTHER RECORD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Darin Erstad's remarkable season _ his
major-league-leading hit total, 166 at game time, his major
league-leading multihit games, etc. _ has been well chronicled.
</P>
<P>
   Now, one more:
</P>
<P>
   Erstad is on pace to become the first major-leaguer to record
100 RBI from the leadoff position.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad started the night with 73 RBI, tied with Garret Anderson
for second on the club behind Mo Vaughn's 77.
</P>
<P>
   Also: Erstad needs just one home run and two stolen bases to
become only the fourth Angels player with at least 20 homers and 20
stolen bases in a season. Don Baylor did it three times (1977-79),
Bobby Bonds had 37 homers and 41 steals in 1977 and Devon White did
it in most recently, in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   CAN'T GET ENOUGH: Angels manager Mike Scioscia was pleasantly
surprised when he showed up Thursday afternoon at Edison Field and
saw his entire squad ready to take batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Batting practice was optional since we got home so late (early
Thursday morning from Texas),'' Scioscia said. ``I left it up to
them. Guys need a little breather. By the time we landed, bused to
the stadium and then drove home .. . I'm sure some guys didn't get
home until 3:30 in the morning. And, look, everybody showed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is huge. This is awesome. It shows how much these guys
love the game, how much passion they have for the game, knowing the
price they have to pay to win.
</P>

Single-A California League game Saturday at Stockton against the
Mudville Nine. Scioscia figures Mercker will need three or four
rehab starts before he's ready to return to Anaheim. Mercker will
be restricted to 30 pitches Saturday. &QL;

 FARMERS PIN HOPES ON FINANCING PLAN  &HT;     By KELLY YAMANOUCHI 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Ron Martella could use a new tractor, and maybe
a new truck. The peaches are ripe and ready to be picked off the
trees on his 1,000-acre farm in Hughson, Calif., not far from
Modesto.
</P>
<P>
   But the tractor and the truck will have to wait. That's because
the processor he supplies, Tri Valley Growers, filed for bankruptcy
July 10, and can afford to pay Martella only 70 percent of the
negotiated price for his peaches.
</P>
<P>
   Growers like Martella are members of Tri Valley, an agricultural
cooperative that buys fruits from them and then processes and cans
them.
</P>
<P>
   Tri Valley is scheduled to appear Friday before U.S. Bankruptcy
Court Judge Edward D. Jellen, seeking final approval for $270
million in financing from a consortium of banks.
</P>
<P>
   If the financing plan is approved, the cooperative will be able
to continue processing fruit and could be in a stronger position to
pay Martella and other growers 70 cents on the dollar for their
crops. The financing agreement also calls for the sale of Tri
Valley to a new party by February.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all eyes are on (Friday's) activities in U.S.
bankruptcy court in Oakland (Calif.),'' said Tri Valley spokesman
Fred MacFarlane.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to only getting 70 cents on the dollar for their
crops, the growers are upset because the cooperative is taking only
85 percent of the peaches it agreed to in their contracts. Grape
and pear growers are facing similar problems.
</P>
<P>
   Hardest hit, though, are the tomato growers, who were told that
the processor would buy only 30 percent of their produce.
</P>
<P>
   The growers say they have little room to maneuver. If they break
contract with Tri Valley, Martella said, it would be difficult to
find other processors that would take their peaches without
approval from Tri Valley.
</P>
<P>
   That has left fruit growers in California's Central Valley
scrambling to find a place to unload tons of surplus fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, the California Tomato Growers Association Inc.
asked the U.S. Department of Agriculture to spend $40 million to
$50 million to purchase members' surplus crop. Those funds will be
used to benefit the association's members who belong to the Tri
Valley cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   Their action followed the lead of pear growers, who were told
Monday that the USDA will purchase 32,000 tons of canned pears,
which will be donated to the federal school lunch program and other
USDA programs.
</P>
<P>
   And in an effort to keep peaches out of the market to prevent
prices from dropping, the California Canning Peach Association is
implementing a tree-pull program. The growers will pull about
16,000 tons of peaches and put another 5,000 tons into juice
production.
</P>
<P>
   Growers hope the move will provide Tri Valley with the funds to
pay them for the fruit they supply to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really concerned that in two to three weeks, Tri Valley
will take our crop and not pay for it,'' said Dan Stephens, who has
100 acres of peaches on his farm in Yuba City, Calif., and was
planning on pulling 25 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Martella, also chair of the peach association, said it is
unusual to pull peaches this time of the year. He said they are
usually pulled in the fall, after the fruit has been harvested, or
early in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Pulling the trees before the harvest eliminates jobs in the
field and at the canneries at a time when jobs are badly needed in
the valley, Martella said.
</P>
<P>
   Tri Valley says two tomato canneries, in Thornton and Los Banos,
Calif., have been idled, putting residents there out of jobs and
reducing the load that can be processed.
</P>
<P>
   And earlier this month, Crown Cork &AMP; Seal, which had an
agreement to supply cans to Tri Valley, shut down. The cooperative
had racked up $74 million in debt to the canmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Martella said some growers are close to bankrupt, and will
likely be forced to liquidate their farms as a result of Tri
Valley's decision.

STOREOWNERS SAY CD SALES STRONG DESPITE RECENT ONLINE
MUSIC  HOOPLA
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Greg White stopped in at the Virgin Megastore in
downtown San Francisco on Thursday to check out the latest from
rapper DJ Quik. He bopped his head in time with the music at one of
the store's listening stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes me 10 minutes to download something on the Net,''
27-year-old White said. ``Here, you just push a button.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't kiss off the old economy quite yet. Most people agree that
despite a federal court judge's decision to put the brakes on
Napster, online music resources are here to stay. Still,
record-store customers and employees say you just can't beat the
feel of a CD in the hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I buy a CD, I want the whole thing,'' said Travis
McDonnell, 19. ``I love shopping for CDs. It's one of my favorite
things in the world. I wouldn't trade it for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The recording industry insists that download technologies like
Napster, which Thursday appealed a federal judge's ruling that it
shut down, pose a grave threat to record companies' and artists'
earnings. But the reality appears to be that CD sales are as strong
as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business has never been better,'' said Joe Goldmark, manager
of Amoeba Music on Haight Street in San Francisco. ``We're doing
better every year.''
</P>
<P>
   He accepted that a certain segment of the consumer population
will be drawn to downloading tunes on the Net but said the new
economy still has a way to go before replacing the old.
</P>
<P>
   ``People enjoy the shopping experience,'' Goldmark said. ``They
like to find things they didn't know they wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   The Recording Industry Association of America has estimated that
Napster's 20 million or so users have cost record companies about
$300 million in lost sales.
</P>
<P>
   But that's still a relatively small fraction of the $40 billion
the U.S. recording industry rakes in every year. And it seems that
for every never-say-die Napster user who demands the right to free
downloads, there are numerous others who see things differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get it free but you're not paying off the artist,''
said Jason Mitchell, 25, while browsing Virgin's racks. ``I think
that's terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   He cast his eyes around the store's crowded aisles. ``I prefer
walking into a shop,'' Mitchell said. ``It's more exciting walking
around and looking at CDs and giving things a listen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just like the feel of things,'' agreed Tracey Gray, 33,
checking out songs at a listening station. ``I like to see what
other people are buying.''
</P>
<P>
   Shayde Sartin, a CD salesman at the Borders outlet on Union
Square, said Wednesday's Napster ruling upset him so much that he
spent much of Thursday chatting about it online with other music
buffs.
</P>
<P>
   But whether or not tunes can be tasted for free on the Net, he
said he has no doubt that people will keep buying CDs for their
collections.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will always be record stores,'' Sartin said. ``There
will always be people who have to have record stores.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll get no argument from Stan Goman, chief operating officer
at Tower Records, headquartered in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   ``Napster was never something that scared me, other than that it
gave an impression that music can be had for free, and that's just
not true,'' Goman said.
</P>
<P>
   Napster, he added, ``was originally like a college prank, and
then it became a business.''
</P>
<P>
   Goman admitted he tried it out for himself. He recently
downloaded a song onto his computer and listened to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what?'' he said. ``It sounded like crap. I mean,
what's the big deal there?''

 NET PROJECT HOPES TO BOOST VOTER PARTICIPATION  &HT;     By CARRIE KIRBY 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Internet is offering you a chance to set the
agenda for the coming presidential debates.
</P>
<P>
   Through a Web site set up by the Commission on Presidential
Debates, you'll be able to suggest topics you would like to hear
discussed in the televised debates.
</P>
<P>
   The site,  &LR; www.debates.org &LR; , was set up in an effort to get
voters _ especially young people _ involved in the election
process. The public's interest in political campaigns has been
sinking in recent years, said Heather Balas, the commission's
director of special projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1998 election, 18-to-24-year-olds voted in lower
numbers than they ever had ever before. Tidbits like that led the
debate commission to look fundamentally at our voter education
efforts for this election,'' Balas said.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, the commision realized, would be a good vehicle
for reaching out to youth. The commission also hopes to hook people
of all ages who have not participated in other voter education
projects.
</P>
<P>
   The survey's results will be turned over to debate moderators,
who have not yet been chosen. However, the moderators will have
final say on the topics the candidates debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't insist upon it, but we would be surprised if the
survey results weren't taken into account,'' Balas said.
</P>
<P>
   The polls were created by market research firm Harris
Interactive, and the Web site is designed and powered by sponsors,
including AT&AMP;T, 3Com and Sun Microsystems. The companies behind the
project provided the services and equipment, worth several million
dollars. The commission is a nonprofit organization that has been
organizing the presidential debates since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The predebate survey, available now, also asks how debates
should be conducted. For example, voters can recommend the
traditional, standing-at-a-podium debate or a more-informal town
hall meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site will host chat sessions after each debate where
citizens can discuss what they saw and heard. That feature is an
extension of the commission's DebateWatch program, which, since
1996, has encouraged people to gather at libraries and other
locations to view debates in a group and discuss them afterward.
</P>
<P>
   After each debate, viewers can register their reactions in a
postdebate survey. TV viewing audiences have ranged from 30 million
to 90 million for recent debates.

 HAVING A HEART CAN MAKE JOB CUTS EASIER TO HANDLE  &HT;     By CAROLYN SAID 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Getting laid off is a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the economy is great and unemployment is low. Yes, dot-com
workers have great skills and should be able to land new jobs
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   That does not obviate the human factor when it comes time to cut
staff, said psychologists and human-resources experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a fundamental understanding: This is a very, very
important event in the life of the person being terminated,'' said
Jacques Leger, managing consultant in San Francisco for human
resources consultancy Watson Wyatt Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll remember everything; time will slow down for them,
just like in a car accident it feels like you see the other car
coming at you for 20 minutes,'' Leger said.
</P>
<P>
   In short, be nice. ``The overriding frame is apple pie and
motherhood. Treat everybody with dignity and respect,'' said Jered
Stifter, marketing manager at HR consulting firm Hewitt Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Ways to handle layoffs humanely include:
</P>
<P>
   -- Communicate in person. This is the cardinal rule of layoffs.
Leaving a message on someone's home phone or sending an e-mail is
the worst way to go about it. Experts recommend meeting one-on-one
and keeping it simple. ``Just say that unfortunately, for XYZ
reasons, they don't have a job with us anymore,'' Stifter said.
</P>
<P>
   Having cabs waiting to take people away; having security guards
escort them from their desks; packing up their desks for them are
techniques guaranteed to rankle workers.
</P>
<P>
   -- Remember the survivors. ``One of the dangers when you go into
a layoff mode is losing some people you don't want to lose. We
typically suggest to clients: Pay as much attention to the people
you absolutely want to retain as to those who unfortunately will
get laid off,'' said Stifter.
</P>
<P>
   She suggested having senior management identify by name the
folks the firm absolutely wants to retain, then having the chief
executive officer or a senior vice president meet individually with
them to reinforce how important they are to the organization.
</P>
<P>
   One big way to reassure your remaining employees is to treat the
laid-off workers fairly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to send a message to the survivors: If this were to
happen to you, you too will be protected,'' said Mitchell Marks, an
organizational psychologist based in San Francisco who works with
companies in transition.
</P>
<P>
   -- Don't waffle, don't fudge. ``You have to do what you said you
were going to do,'' said Marks. ``It doesn't matter what the
criteria is (for who gets laid off) as much as if you stick to the
criteria. If you say it's going to be seniority, productivity or
performance, you'd better stick to it. It's extremely disruptive if
you say one thing and do another.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Be generous. Companies are not obligated to offer a severance
package, unless a union agreement or other contract covers this
issue. But financial assistance to tide them over is the top thing
workers will want.
</P>
<P>
   The rule of thumb for severance packages is two weeks for every
year of tenure with the company. Giving more is certainly fine, if
you have it. Although under COBRA Compliance Systems Inc.
regulations, employees are guaranteed that they can continue their
medical insurance at the group rate a corporation is charged, and
companies can help even more by continuing to subsidize health
benefits for a couple of months.
</P>
<P>
   The company is under no obligation to offer early vesting of
stock options, unless an employee had negotiated that when hired.
But if employees are just weeks away from rounding out a year of
service, allowing that year to vest is another generous thing to
do.
</P>
<P>
   -- Offer emotional support. People being laid off go through the
same stages of grief as someone suffering a bereavement. Providing
individual counseling services and hiring a facilitator to conduct
a meeting where people can vent are steps that can benefit the
laid-off workers and survivors. ``Recognize that people have to let
go of the old before they accept the new,'' Marks said.
</P>
<P>
   -- Provide job-hunt help. ``One of the best things you can do is
say, `We've contacted the following four competitors, and you can
send them your resume,' '' said Leger. ``It's a really positive
message to leave people in terms of your competence as an
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Hiring an outplacement firm is another traditional approach.
John Challenger, CEO of outplacement firm Challenger, Gray &AMP;
Christmas of Chicago, said his firm has worked with more than 100
laid-off dot-com workers in the past year. It offers individual
counseling, resume writing and design, computerized ad answering
and a database of employers, among other services. The company
declined to say how much it charges.

TRUCKING COMPANY SEIZES OPPORTUNITY IN BAY AREA REAL ESTATE  MARKET

</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CAROL EMERT 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Taking advantage of the Bay Area real estate
run-up, Consolidated Freightways has sold its 2.3-acre Menlo Park,
Calif., headquarters for tens of millions of dollars and will move
to Washington state next month, the company announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Transferring its headquarters to a less-expensive area has a
secondary advantage of helping the trucking company recruit
employees who can't afford to live in the Bay Area, Consolidated
said.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in Portland, Ore., in 1929, Consolidated moved to Menlo
Park in 1956, paying about $2 million for its offices. The
headquarters, located in a suburban office park, was recently sold
to an unidentified buyer for ``north of $30 million,'' said company
spokesman Mike Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The Menlo Park office's 99 employees, which include chief
executive Pat Blake and other top executives, will move next month
to Vancouver, Wash. The company will also sell a 12-acre Portland
administrative campus and move those 837 workers to Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said centralizing its administrative functions is the main
reason for the move, but Bay Area expenses also weighed heavily in
the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlocking the tremendous real estate value that has grown
under our Menlo Park property over 40 years makes excellent
financial sense for our shareholders,'' Blake said in a statement.
Profits will be used to build new terminals, he said. Blake was
traveling and could not be reached for comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Consolidated has had difficulty recruiting
administrative assistants to work in Menlo Park, even for healthy
annual wages of $40,000 to $60,000, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   The company has also faced problems when it wanted to transfer
middle and upper managers from around the country to work short
stints in Menlo Park. ``We have had managers say they just can't
consider that kind of traumatic move'' because of the high cost of
living, Brown said.

   Consolidated was the country's biggest trucking company in the
'60s, but has since been surpassed by several rivals. It is the
country's third-largest ``less-than-truckload'' freight company,
meaning that it carries shipments for multiple customers in the
same truck.
</P>
<P>
   Consolidated's performance has been spotty in recent years, with
sales declining slightly in 1998 but then rising to $2.4 billion in
1999. Profits slipped to $7.9 million last year from $52 million in
1998 as the company wrestled with its mix of light and heavy
freight.

 SYMANTEC STEPS UP SECURITY WITH ACQUISITION DEAL  &HT;     By VERNE KOPYTOFF 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Symantec, the maker of security software for
personal computers, said Thursday that it will acquire corporate
security software company Axent Technologies for $975 million in
stock.
</P>
<P>
   If the deal is approved by shareholders, it will create a giant
in the computer security software industry serving both consumer
and corporate markets.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed acquisition is designed to expand Symantec's
offering of business products, especially for large corporations,
and allow Axent to grow more rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Symantec, based in Cupertino, Calif., is best known as the
manufacturer of Norton AntiVirus software, which protects millions
of personal computers from online attack. Axent of Rockville, Md.,
creates software that defends corporate computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   The combined companies, to be called Symantec, are expected to
take in $1 billion in revenues for the fiscal year ending in March
2001. That would rank the company as among the leaders in the
computer security software industry, along with Check Point
Software Technologies of Redwood City, Calif., and Network
Associates in Santa Clara, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Both the consumer and corporate industries are growing rapidly
as the expansion of Internet commerce and communication creates
greater opportunity for computer virus attacks and snooping.
</P>
<P>
   International Data Corp., a market research and publishing
company in Framingham, Mass., predicts that the consumer and
corporate markets for computer antivirus software, firewalls and
intrusion detection will at least double by 2003 to between $5
billion and $7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Prince, an analyst who covers network security, computer
networks and software for Forrester Research, a market research
company in Cambridge, Mass., praised Symantec's acquisition of
Axent. He said that it allows Symantec to offer a broader range of
products to businesses, especially the bigger ones.
</P>
<P>
   However, Prince added that Symantec should be cautious about
expanding too much. He said Axent had previously considered
building and running computer security systems for companies, an
idea that he called a potential ``rat hole.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They stand to shoot themselves in the foot if they try to cast
the net too broadly,'' Prince said.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Hodges, president of McAfee, a computer antivirus
softwaremaker and Symantec competitor, gloated over the news of the
acquisition and predicted that his company will gain an advantage.
He said that it will ``defocus'' Symantec as it tries to integrate
Axent employees with its own and make the company too big to react
to a rapidly changing marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our view is that we are very happy that Symantec is doing
this,'' said Hodges, whose company is part of Network Associates.
``They will execute less well.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Gail Hamilton, a senior vice president for Symantec's
business software division, said that her company's acquisition
will create one of the biggest groups of computer security experts
in the world. It will allow the two companies to grow more rapidly
and create better products.
</P>
<P>
   The deal put a 67 percent premium on Axent's stock as of closing
price Wednesday. Axent shareholders will get one-half of a Symantec
share, valued at $31.84.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, shares of Symantec fell to $50.25 from $63.69. Axent's
shares increased from $19.06 to $24.

 MOST LAID-OFF TECH WORKERS DON'T STAY JOBLESS FOR LONG  &HT;     By CARRIE KIRBY 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ No one likes the sound of a startup's dreams
shattering into little pieces or the slow gurgling of a dot-com
whose stock price is sinking.
</P>
<P>
   For Jerry McLaughlin and other employers in desperate staffing
straits, though, it's an opportune time to move quickly and grab
laid-off workers before they find other jobs.
</P>
<P>
   To lure tech workers laid off from nearby startups, McLaughlin
hung a bright yellow sign in the window of his customer relations
company, User Interface, which said: ``Your dot.com in trouble? Get
in here!''
</P>
<P>
   Other Bay Area recruiters use more traditional methods such as
calling struggling companies' human resources managers or
contacting individual workers. Some even post job openings on Web
sites such as StartUpFailures.com, where employees of failed
ventures congregate.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of job search has paid off. FamilyWonder.com, a video
and toy e-tailer, has interviewed former employees of defunct
companies Petstore.com, Reel.com and Toysmart.com in recent months,
and gotten about 15 percent of its new hires from those companies,
said founder Jonathan Kaplan.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we hear about XYZ Co. not doing well, we've contacted HR
departments and said, `We have these job openings, and we just
wanted to let you know we can help,' '' Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
   Companies compete fiercely for access to laid-off employees
before their last day at work. When Hollywood Entertainment said
last month that it would shut its Emeryville Reel.com division,
human resources received inquiries from about 50 hopeful companies
in a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood Entertainment HR executive Michelle Van Hoose invited
several of the earliest and most aggressive hiring companies to
come in and meet employees.
</P>
<P>
   One East Bay dot-com brought in a keg of beer to convince
Reel.com employees to stay after work and talk, Van Hoose said.
Blockbuster.com offered to pay for a job fair including other
companies, but Van Hoose turned them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids didn't want it,'' Van Hoose said, referring to
Reel.com's mostly young staff. ``All they wanted to do is take the
summer off.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, says headhunter Derrek Milan, is that once a layoff
is reported by the news media, it's often too late to land the
engineers and other valuable employees who have already found new
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiters try to stay ahead of the curve by subscribing to
insider e-mail newsletters detailing each week's layoffs and
checking gossip Web sites regularly. But beating other recruiters
requires sniffing out company problems before the layoff, Milan
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a company pulls back and puts off its IPO, we react to
it,'' said Milan, whose recruiting firm, Monday Technology
Solutions, has gotten half its job candidates from near-death
companies in the past three months.
</P>
<P>
   One tactic recruiters employ is searching online resume
databases such as Monster.com or Dice.com for resumes from specific
local startups.
</P>
<P>
   ``If any given day you see three resumes from one company's
employees, you gotta wonder what's going on,'' said David LaVigni,
staffing director for the tech news Web site ZDNet.
</P>
<P>
   ZDNet tries to be vigilant about anticipating layoffs, but the
company still missed a downsizing that happened right under its
nose, said LaVigni.
</P>
<P>
   When Linuxcare, one of six companies that share ZDNet's Townsend
Street building, reduced its staff by an estimated 70 people in
May, ZDNet didn't hear about it until the cutbacks were public
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have put a sign in the deli downstairs if we had
known earlier,'' LaVigni said.
</P>
<P>
   He's considering assigning interns the task of studying
vulnerable companies' quarterly reports and other financial news,
looking for cracks in the armor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It needs to be part of our strategy in this job market,''
LaVigni said.

GUNMAN HOLDS PILOT HOSTAGE AT KENNEDY AIRPORT; PASSENGERS ESCAPE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout; subs byline)  By ANDY NEWMAN and SHAILA K. DEWAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A man with a handgun walked quietly into the cockpit
of a National Airlines jet at Kennedy International Airport about
10 on Thursday night and took the pilot and co-pilot hostage, then
released the pilot an hour or so later with a list of demands, the
Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing the man with the gun heading for the cockpit, the
passengers rushed off the plane and all escaped unharmed,
passengers and Greg Trevor, a Port Authority spokesman, said. Many
passengers on the plane, which was to have left for Las Vegas,
described scenes of pandemonium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat down, got buckled up and the next thing I know everybody
was screaming,'' said Misty Nichols, 27, a nurse from Carmel, N.Y.,
who was leaving for a vacation. Then, she said, people started
rushing to get off the plane. A little girl next to her was knocked
over, she said, but an older man picked her up and helped her.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols said she later tried to retrieve some of her belongings,
but someone yelled, ``Get off the plane _ your life is more
important than your stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Weiss, another passenger, told CNN that he was sitting
near the front of the first-class section when he ``heard a voice,
a very low voice, saying `Be quiet.''' He said that he looked up
and saw ``a dark-skinned man in his late 20s with a 10- to 12-inch
gun in his right hand, walking very briskly toward the cockpit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He walked into the cockpit and closed the door,'' Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
   The man was wearing a white long-sleeved shirt and did not
appear to be an airline employee, at least not one in uniform,
Weiss and some other passengers said.
</P>
<P>
   He apparently made his way onto the plane simply by running past
security workers, Trevor of the Port Authority said.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers go through a metal detector right before the enter
the jetway.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the gunman pulled his gun out right before the
metal detector, told a group of elderly people to get out of his
way and boarded the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after all the passengers left the plane, several police
officers with ``big guns'' boarded, Nichols said.
</P>
<P>
   The flight, National Airlines Flight 19, a Boeing 757, was
scheduled to take off at 9:30 p.m. but did not begin boarding until
after 10 p.m., passengers said.
</P>
<P>
   One passenger, who was not identified, told ABC News that the
man held the gun down in front of him with both hands to make it
clear to passengers that he was armed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me to be quiet,'' the passenger said. I grabbed my
friends and we just piled off the plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Another passegner, Frank Clark, 30, a computer engineer from
Brooklyn, was in first class and had just been served a drink when
he heard the commotion and saw the gunman enter the cockpit. The
passenger sitting next to Clark said, ``The guy's got a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all it took,'' Clark said. ``It was a road race from
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all the passengers appeared to panic, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy sitting next to me really tripped me out because he
kept his drink,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   National, formed a year ago and based in Las Vegas, is a small
airline, with a fleet of 11 Boeing 757-200's flying nonstop to Las
Vegas to eight other cities. But it is growing fast. It began
turning a profit in March, after only 10 months in the air,
becoming one of the fastest new airlines in history to make money,
according to Aviation Daily, a trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   National runs four flights a day from Kennedy Airport to Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The airline itself declined to comment on the crisis. A man who
answered the phone at National Airlines's toll-free reservation
number said, ``We have no comment and no numbers for you to call,''
then hung up.

 DOT-COMS HANDLE LAYOFFS THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY  &HT;     By CAROLYN SAID  
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Now that the Internet bubble has burst and
dozens of companies are laying off employees, are dot-coms doing a
better job of handing out pink slips than brick-and-mortar
companies?
</P>
<P>
   Not really.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that said they could reinvent the wheel for doing
business are, at best, following well-worn tire tracks when it
comes to reductions in force. At worst, they're treating cast-off
workers like spam mail that they can't wait to delete.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing anecdotally when dot-com people get laid off
is it's generally been handled well but not great,'' said Jacques
Leger, a managing consultant in San Francisco with human resources
consultancy Watson Wyatt Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many companies have communicated poorly. When they lay off 20
out of 100 people in the company, you'd think they could do a
better job with the other 80. Severance packages tend not to be
planned as directly or clearly as at big companies going through
massive layoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The layoffs continue to mount. According to outplacement firm
Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas of Chicago, more than 7,500 dot-com
workers have been laid off nationwide this year, almost 2,200 of
them just in the past month.
</P>
<P>
   There are only so many ways to tell people they are out of a
job. Employers can soften the blow by providing a cushion of money,
a shoulder to cry on and a hand in finding a new job. But many
fledgling startups have neither the financial resources, the time
nor the inclination to offer much practical support.
</P>
<P>
   Will Dunkak, 48, left a job with an ``old economy'' firm _ he
was a senior financial analyst at Prudential Securities _ in
October to go to a San Mateo, Calif., startup, PrivateExpress.com,
as business development manager.
</P>
<P>
   He was impressed by the company's business plan and technology:
It was trying to be the FedEx of the Internet, providing a digital
way to deliver huge documents across the country instantaneously
and securely.
</P>
<P>
   On July 5, the day after a four-day holiday weekend,
PrivateExpress called two meetings for its two dozen U.S.
employees. In one conference room, eight people were told they were
being let go; in the other room, the attendees were told they would
remain. Dunkak was in the laid-off group.
</P>
<P>
   PrivateExpress paid the laid-off workers for their outstanding
vacation time. Dunkak said the company chairman had assured workers
that a severance package would be forthcoming in a couple of weeks.
After numerous phone calls, Dunkak said he was told that some
severance money might be available in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're starting to play games,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said it would accelerate vesting for the
laid-off workers as if they had worked a full year, according to
Dunkak. He was 3-1/2 months away from completing a full year, which
would have given him 25 percent of his stock options. He doesn't
know if PrivateExpress will make good on that promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happened so far has been nothing more than lip service.
They haven't come through on anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Levy, PrivateExpress chairman, said he felt the company had
been straightforward in dealing with laid-off workers. He declined
to discuss specifically how it handled severance and vesting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are private personnel and payroll matters that no one
inside a company in their right mind would ever discuss publicly,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; `Reasonably Humane'
</P>
<P>
   At some other firms, laid-off employees felt they were better
treated, at least on the financial side.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon's MedicaLogic/Medscape gave two months' salary, plus pay
for unused vacation time, to all 110 of the workers it cut from its
San Francisco office, even those who had been with the company just
a few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they were reasonably humane,'' said a former
MedicaLogic/Medscape employee, who was laid off in June. ``It
seemed like they went out of their way to give us a decent
severance for laying us off wholesale.''
</P>
<P>
   The company offered an additional six weeks' pay to employees
who agreed not to participate in any potential class-action suits
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Severance pay was also ample at San Francisco's Healthshop,
which laid off most of its 65 employees in April before being sold
to rival HealthCentral.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a quite generous severance package,'' said Francine
Schwartz, who was a writer at Healthshop. ``I'd been there less
than six months, and I received four weeks severance.''
</P>
<P>
   COBRA Bite
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes the money just isn't there.
</P>
<P>
   Violet.com, an 18-person online boutique in San Francisco,
closed in April when it couldn't land new funding. Up until the
last minute, the founders were conducting ``a full-court press'' to
seek additional funding or a merger partner, according to Karen
Wickre, Violet.com vice president and executive producer.
</P>
<P>
   About two weeks before they ran out of money, they told
employees that they still hoped to make a deal but wanted to give
them a heads-up. No deal came through, and when the company closed,
there was just enough money to pay employees for their unused
vacation time.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Wickre found to her dismay that COBRA, the federal law
guaranteeing that terminated workers can continue their insurance
coverage through their company's health plan, does not apply when a
company goes out of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned the following surprising fact: There's no COBRA
benefits if there's no group plan. There's no group plan if the
company folds,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Lesard, co-author of the book ``NetSlaves: True Tales of
Working the Web'' and co-founder of the NetSlaves Web site, said he
thinks companies on the verge of extinction could handle things
differently. ``These companies will go and go and go until there's
no gas left in the tank. When it would be time to give employees
some severance, they can't do it because there's no gas left,
rather than stopping earlier and saying `We're not going to make
it, let's save something for severance.'''
</P>
<P>
   Some ways companies can support laid-off employees don't cost
money. For example, they can use their networks to help laid-off
workers find new jobs. SameDay.com, which is backed by IdeaLab, a
Pasadena, Calif., startup incubator, contacted other IdeaLab
companies to try to find new jobs for the dozen workers it laid off
last month.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, it had an in-house recruiter assist the employees,
according to Erin Mills, a marketing associate at the Los Angeles
firm.
</P>
<P>
   But many dot-com firms are so new, and their executives are so
inexperienced, that they don't have a sense of how to handle
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the people who run these businesses have been on an
economic upswing their whole life,'' said Leger, the HR consultant.
``The chase has been about acquiring talent, not letting it go.
They look at (having to lay people off) and go, `Holy hell, what do
I do now?'''
</P>
<P>
   That can result in poor communications that increase unease
among remaining workers. Leger told of one company that shrank from
240 employees to 150, without ever discussing the situation with
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't do anything dramatic; (they) used some attrition,
closed down some projects. It was unplanned and unstructured in
appearance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Leger, the company neglected to reassure the
remaining workers, even as they saw colleagues disappear around
them. ``They never transmitted to people the message that they
shouldn't panic and run,'' he said, noting that a more-experienced
organization would have handled the situation better.
</P>
<P>
   No Time to Mourn
</P>
<P>
   The go-go pace of Internet time means companies are in a rush to
cut costs and move on. ``Traditional companies are likely to
realize that surviving employees have got to go through a mourning
period,'' said Mitchell Marks, a San Francisco organizational
psychologist who works with firms in transition. ``They might
sponsor certain events: venting meetings where people can talk
through what they've lost. In younger companies, it's more, `The
pain is over, let's get on with it.'''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to stock options, companies generally are under no
obligation to laid-off workers. Stock options usually are granted
over a period of time, with one-quarter vesting each year for four
years, for example. Some companies have accelerated vesting so
laid-off employees get vested as if they have completed that year
of service.
</P>
<P>
   But those stock options may not be worth anything. The markets
are not currently receptive to new dot-com offerings and dot-coms
that already went public are largely trading underwater.
</P>
<P>
   For people who have worked 70-hour weeks in hopes of cashing in
big-time, this reality can be traumatic.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Kaye, a San Francisco psychologist, said he has seen
this among clients. ``Their expectations were that they'd find gold
in these dot-com hills. Some have sacrificed quite a bit in terms
of personal life, emotional commitment to the company. If they
don't get vested, they feel as if everything they've sacrificed was
for naught.''

last month that it would shut its Emeryville Reel.com division,
human resources received inquiries from about 50 hopeful companies
in a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood Entertainment HR executive Michelle Van Hoose invited
several of the earliest and most aggressive hiring companies to
come in and meet employees.
</P>
<P>
   One East Bay dot-com brought in a keg of beer to convince
Reel.com employees to stay after work and talk, Van Hoose said.
Blockbuster.com offered to pay for a job fair including other
companies, but Van Hoose turned them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids didn't want it,'' Van Hoose said, referring to
Reel.com's mostly young staff. ``All they wanted to do is take the
summer off.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, says headhunter Derrek Milan, is that once a layoff
is reported by the news media, it's often too late to land the
engineers and other valuable employees who have already found new
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiters try to stay ahead of the curve by subscribing to
insider e-mail newsletters detailing each week's layoffs and
checking gossip Web sites regularly. But beating other recruiters
requires sniffing out company problems before the layoff, Milan
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a company pulls back and puts off its IPO, we react to
it,'' said Milan, whose recruiting firm, Monday Technology
Solutions, has gotten half its job candidates from near-death
companies in the past three months.
</P>
<P>
   One tactic recruiters employ is searching online resume
databases such as Monster.com or Dice.com for resumes from specific
local startups.
</P>
<P>
   ``If any given day you see three resumes from one company's
employees, you gotta wonder what's going on,'' said David LaVigni,
staffing director for the tech news Web site ZDNet.
</P>
<P>
   ZDNet tries to be vigilant about anticipating layoffs, but the
company still missed a downsizing that happened right under its
nose, said LaVigni.
</P>
<P>
   When Linuxcare, one of six companies that share ZDNet's Townsend
Street building, reduced its staff by an estimated 70 people in
May, ZDNet didn't hear about it until the cutbacks were public
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have put a sign in the deli downstairs if we had
known earlier,'' LaVigni said.
</P>
<P>
   He's considering assigning interns the task of studying
vulnerable companies' quarterly reports and other financial news,
looking for cracks in the armor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It needs to be part of our strategy in this job market,''
LaVigni said.

EARNINGS TALK IS GAINING URGENCY AT AMAZON.COM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many years from now, Amazon.com may become famous as the company
that wrote the book on e-commerce but couldn't survive long enough
to prosper from its own lessons.
</P>
<P>
   The company this week posted yet another big loss, which was
more than double last year's second-quarter loss despite an 84
percent surge in sales for the same period. During its five-year
history, the conventional accounting wisdom on Wall Street puts the
company's cumulative losses at over $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The validity of this stupendous number has been challenged by
some interesting financial analysis, however, most recently in The
New Yorker. ``Financial Page'' columnist James Surowiecki said the
actual cash loss has been $60 million at best, and possibly $130
million at worst, using more conservative accounting methods.
</P>
<P>
   Surowiecki said much of the $1 billion figure usually cited is
due to paper losses from ``goodwill charges'' incurred during
acquisitions of other companies. What has also helped Amazon.com,
he said, is the company's ability to control inventory tightly,
which has enabled it to keep operating costs down.
</P>
<P>
   If this is indeed the accounting reality, it lends substantial
credibility to the company's claims that it still has plenty of
cash available to ride out its loss-ridden early years long enough
to generate the profits critical to its eventual survival.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, when measured by its sales, it has been the most
incredible success story of the young e-tailing age. This explains
why stock investors until recently treated it as the retail phenom
it had become.
</P>
<P>
   Contrarians, however, kept claiming its lofty stock price
couldn't last unless the company began to show signs of becoming
profitable. Devotees of new-economy analysis demurred, saying that
as long as sales were expanding, earnings could wait. Everyone,
they said, understood profits would materialize after Amazon got
through its difficult start-up stage.
</P>
<P>
   The thinking of the old-economy disciples is being vindicated of
late, though, as the once high-flying Amazon stock has thudded to
earth. Even before the latest bad news, the stock had been off
nearly 70 percent from its 52-week high, and the latest
discouraging word sent it lower.
</P>
<P>
   The question increasingly facing fans of Amazon.com is whether
the company can survive its youthful growing pains long enough to
emerge as an enterprise profitable enough to justify the bets made
by its long-term stockholders.
</P>
<P>
   Even its boss has begun to understand the need to shed the loser
image. After the latest red ink was revealed, Chief Executive Jeff
Bezos said the company had focused more on the need for earnings.
Analysts saw this comment as reflecting a significant change in a
corporate philosophy heretofore heedless of the need for profits.
</P>
<P>
   For investors who have kept the faith, The New Yorker analysis
was heartening. Surowiecki noted that Amazon.com's early history
had a remarkable resemblance to Wal-Mart's. Amazon.com in 2001, he
said, should look a lot like the Wal-Mart of 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The question mark for Amazon.com, he said, is not so much a
matter of having enough money to get through the lean times, but
whether it can retain the loyalty of its customers after achieving
profitability.

JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE RETIREMENT AGE DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO
RETIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSASS CITY, Mo. _ Forgive Elisabeth Brunson for being a bit
befuddled about age discrimination complaints in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   She's 80. She's had no trouble finding work when she wants it.
She's working full time. And, frankly, her current supervisor
wouldn't mind cloning her if there weren't a lot of ethical bears
to wrestle first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elisabeth is knowledgeable, she's dedicated, she's a wonderful
worker,'' said Diane McPherson, supervisor in the inbound customer
service call center for National Seminars Group, where Brunson
works in Overland Park.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Brunson is always willing to learn something new.
Already a 120-words-a-minute typist, Brunson in the last six months
taught herself the 10-key touch pad to speed up data entry on
numbers-rich reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to do better for myself, not to beat or impress
somebody else,'' Brunson said. ``I want to do the best I can and
grow with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Every older worker isn't guaranteed the acceptance and
contentment that Brunson enjoys. Tales abound of angry, older job
hunters who feel put out to pasture.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a survey released last year by OI Partners, a career
consulting organization, found that workers with more than 20 years
of experience landed new jobs in the same amount of time as younger
workers _ provided they kept their skills up to date and adapted to
fast-paced work environments.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, changing demographics are welcoming older
adults back into the workplace. As the baby boomer population bulge
begins to retire, there aren't enough younger workers to take their
place. Older people are filling the void and frequently exceeding
performance expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Powell, a psychologist at Harvard University Health
Services, has studied ``cognitive aging'' and determined that a
``substantial proportion'' of those between age 55 and 72 score as
well as or better than younger adults on tests of their
intellectual vigor.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say age discrimination doesn't occur. Harvey
Sterns, professor of gerontology at the University of Akron, sees a
trend of lower wages, harsher performance appraisals and less
training given to older workers, possibly under the assumption that
older workers aren't adaptable or trainable.
</P>
<P>
   Brunson's experience suggests otherwise. Her work history
doesn't provide boilerplate answers for every older person, but her
suggestions do provide sound job-hunting tips for others.
</P>
<P>
   Brunson retired at age 69 after working as a secretary for about
50 years. She promptly got bored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not domestic,'' she said. ``I like the office environment,
and I couldn't stand retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   So she volunteered three days a week at Providence Medical
Center in Kansas City, Kan., where she learned new word processing
and data entry skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved it, but after a while I thought I might as well make
some money doing it,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   She responded to an employment sign she saw on the highway,
which turned out to be from a temporary-staffing service. That
agency didn't have anything for her right away, but the seed was
sown. She applied with another temporary-employment agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Elisabeth came to us at the age of 76, we didn't have a
bit of trouble placing her,'' said Ron Trachsel, owner of Trac
Staffing Services.
</P>
<P>
   Her first job assignment was to do data entry at Wolferman's
Original English Muffin Co., where she worked for a couple of
months. When that temporary job ended, she was placed at National
Seminars for nine months. After that, Trac Staffing sent her to
three or four other assignments before the call came to return to
National Seminars.
</P>
<P>
   Trac Staffing paid her $8 an hour and gave her something else:
</P>
<P>
   ``Confidence,'' Brunson said. ``The temporary work was good for
me. I used to be shy, almost afraid to lift my head up and talk to
people. Being temporary helped push me out to meet people, to get
into strange environments and learn new things.''
</P>
<P>
   National Seminars offered to hire Brunson full time after she'd
worked there on contract with the temporary agency for more than
three years. As a regular employee, she is eligible for the
company's employee benefits package and the opportunity to earn
commissions on any sales she might make while handling inbound
customer service business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized the job Elisabeth was doing was not temporary,
that it was growing and growing and was not going to go away,''
McPherson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say, `She's 80 years old? You hired someone who's
80 years old?' I say I hired a great worker.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Brunson's ``retirement age'' peers tell her they'd like
to work, too. But, Brunson finds, they're often too particular
about where and when they work or they've let their skills get
rusty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the key is not getting out of the workplace for long. I
never was, not since I was 17,'' Brunson noted. ``I've never been
one to let grass grow under my feet. You have to be flexible and
open. You have to be willing to take what you get, work hard and
then move up. You can't expect to come in at the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Trachsel said Brunson epitomizes a job-hunting strategy that he
recommends to other older workers, whether they were laid off or
are trying to re-enter the job market after retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get your foot in the door through temporary
placements,'' Trachsel said. ``Once your skills and work ethic are
known, it would be hard to discriminate.''

THE POLITICAL AD SEASON IS HEATING UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Get ready. Get set. Brace yourselves.
</P>
<P>
   A dazzling cacophony of points and counterpoints, nice-guy
images and Darth Vader contrasts is beginning to emerge from your
TV.
</P>
<P>
   They're political ads, and they're aimed at getting you to do
one thing:
</P>
<P>
   Vote for Candidate X over Candidate Y.
</P>
<P>
   And with more competitive races than usual and more money in the
system than ever, expect more ads _ a whole lot more _ than before.
That means more talking heads, more confusing claims, more
politicians speaking/lecturing/preaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a tsunami,'' said Chuck Hatfield, campaign
manager for Jay Nixon, the 1998 Missouri Democratic Senate
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   So what's a voter to do?
</P>
<P>
   Well believe it or not, ads can teach you some things about the
candidates. So why not arm yourself with a few tools so you can
evaluate the ads during the long haul between now and Election Day?
</P>
<P>
   You'll need them. Campaigns usually try to run each of their ads
so that a typical viewer sees a spot at least 10 times on various
TV shows. In a race like this year's U.S. Senate contest in
Missouri between Democrat Mel Carnahan and Republican John
Ashcroft, each candidate will run, say, eight to 10 different ads.
</P>
<P>
   That means Mr. or Mrs. Typical Viewer will see 80 to 100 ads per
candidate. That's 200 ads for the race, and that's only one race.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis, Missouri's largest TV market, already has been hit by
a tidal wave of political ads from Missouri candidates for U.S.
Senate and governor. In Kansas City, the first Missouri ads began
this week. They feature the candidates for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Rule One for viewing political ads: Don't make up your mind
about how to vote in a race based on a single ad. Shading the truth
is, of course, what many of these spots do best.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, media critic Norman Soloman suggests that when it comes
to political ads, you should believe nothing. Zip. Nada.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advertisements really are an obstacle course that voters need
to run,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another view comes from G.R. Boynton, a University of Iowa
political scientist and an expert on political advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few political ads are outright lies,'' he said. ``But
they are misleading. They take statements out of context. In that
sense, they distort.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider two hard-hitting ads that recently ran in St. Louis
that do exactly that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, Mel Carnahan tried a state government takeover of
your health care,'' claimed an ad sponsored by the Missouri
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Counters a Missouri Democratic Party spot: ``Senator John
Ashcroft's record on seniors' issues is one of the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute. The comment about Carnahan is an exaggeration
aimed at frightening voters. The criticism aimed at Ashcroft comes
from a group that even Democrats have criticized as one prone to
``scaring the bejesus out of seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   But sitting at home, it's hard to make those judgments. The
tricky thing about political ads is that they enjoy a special
freedom. Thanks to the First Amendment, they can pretty much claim
anything, true or not. Hawking beer or cars or potato chips falls
into a different category where a degree of truthfulness is
required.
</P>
<P>
   Political ads also tend to be nasty, unpleasant little
exchanges. They are, in a word, negative. And they are negative
because that tactic works.
</P>
<P>
   Voters hate negative ads. Still, they remember them, Democratic
consultant Jill Buckley once said in Congressional Quarterly Weekly
Report. ``The problem with positive (ads) is that you have to run
it again and again and again to make it stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``With negative (ads), the poll numbers will move in three or
four days.''
</P>
<P>
   Negative or not, the power of advertising is not in doubt.
Studies show that one of the best ways to predict the winner of a
congressional race is to check which candidate spends the most on
TV.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the power of the TV medium has been very much
in evidence in Kansas and Missouri. In 1998, for example, 3rd
District congressional contender Dennis Moore's use of an ad where
he played his guitar was viewed as a big hit. It cut through the
clutter of other ads and made Moore, who won the election, as
something more than just a politician.
</P>
<P>
   Vince Snowbarger, Moore's Republican opponent, aired just three
ads, none of which revealed anything about Snowbarger the person.
That was a mistake, his camp admitted later.
</P>
<P>
   With so many campaigns vying for attention this year, expect the
unexpected. Candidates, particularly those who aren't well-known,
may take more risks than usual in their TV ads, said David
Israelite, political director for the Republican National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're likely to see more gimmicks and pageantry,'' he said,
``than at a professional wrestling match.''

NOTES COLUMN: I WAS WRONG ABOUT SCIOSCIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.2000 Long Beach Pres-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I snickered when the Angels hired Mike Scioscia as their manager
last November.
</P>
<P>
   I figured they did so for no other reason than he was willing to
work for a mere $350,000 pittance.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Mike Scioscia wasn't exactly a proven managerial
commodity, guiding the Albuquerque Dukes to a 65-74 record last
summer that left Dodgers management so unimpressed that it gladly
accepted Scioscia's resignation from the organization at the end of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, what could Mike Scioscia do with the Angels that, say,
Terry Collins couldn't do?
</P>
<P>
   Well, as it turns out, plenty.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Scioscia, despite a Pick Your Starter &AMP; Pray pitching
staff, has kept the Angels over .500 throughout the season and in
contention in the AL West Division.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was wrong, Mike, you certainly turned out to be a much
better manager than I thought you'd be,'' I said late Thursday
afternoon to Scioscia, who was seated in his office in the Angels'
locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, and if we were to go on an eight-game losing streak,
you'd start writing I'm a lousy manager,'' smiled Scioscia.
</P>
<P>
   Not now.
</P>
<P>
   Not after the way Mike Scioscia has brought desperately needed
stability into an Angels clubhouse that imploded a year ago with
Terry Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Not after the way Mike Scioscia has managed to keep the Angels
competitive despite DL injuries to veteran pitchers (Ken Hill, Kent
Bottenfield, Kent Mercker and Tim Belcher) and despite having to
rely on an array of untested young pitchers (Seth Etherton, Scott
Schoeneweis, Brian Cooper and Jarrod Washburn).
</P>
<P>
   Not after the way Mike Scioscia has his players performing with
intensity on a regular basis and even taking batting practice when
they aren't obligated to, which was the case Thursday after the
team had returned from Texas early in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see these players go out there on their own and hit when
they didn't have to shows me how much they want to win,'' said
Scioscia.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn credits Scioscia with the dramatic change in the
Angels' attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no garbage on this team,'' said the first baseman
before the Angels faced the Chicago White Sox at Edison Field.
``Everyone is pulling for everyone else, and Mike is responsible
for that. He's a very positive person who knows how to get the most
out of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``He also sees everything out there on the field. Mike
definitely knows baseball, and the players have come to respect
that knowledge and the leadership he has provided us.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia says he's enjoying his first season with the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you this job has given me a new-found respect for the
people who have done it over the years,'' he said. ``It's
tremendously time-consuming and very demanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes up basically your whole life. You have to have more
than a love for baseball to be a manager. You have to have a
passion for it. It's not easy. There are new challenges facing you
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge facing Mike Scioscia is that the Angels aren't
going to go out and get a Denny Neagle like the New York Yankees
did or a Curt Shilling like the Arizona Diamondbacks did.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to take the group of guys I have and win with
them,'' said Scioscia. ``I can't worry about things I have no
control over.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia has been making the 140-mile round trip commute from
his Thousand Oaks residence to Anaheim for the Angels home games,
but is renting a place in Newport Beach for the next month. ...
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia, on the hit-crazed Darin Erstad: ``He's definitely been
our MVP. You ask any player in the clubhouse, and he'd tell you the
same thing''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have an exceptional public address announcer in David
Courtney, who also handles such chores for the Kings. Courtney was
the one doing PA duties in the Disney movie ``Angels In The
Outfield.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure it's a mere coincidence that the Seattle Mariners
are in first place after bringing back Long Beach's Bob Harrison in
the offseason as a scout after a 14-year absence from the team. ...
</P>
<P>
   I thought either the Dodgers or San Francisco Giants were
capable of dethroning the Arizona Diamondbacks in the NL West
Division until Wednesday. That's when the Diamondbacks assured
themselves of another division title and a probable postseason
showdown against the Atlanta Braves when they acquired Curt
Shilling. Shilling and Randy Johnson in the same pitching rotation?
Why couldn't we have Jerry Colangelo as a baseball owner in
Southern California?. ...
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers sure did go out and get a proven macho tough guy in
Ismael Valdes to fill a desperate starting pitching void, didn't
they? ...
</P>
<P>
   If I were voting today for the NL's Most Valuable Player, I'd
cast my ballot for the Dodgers' Gary Sheffield. ...
</P>
<P>
   He might not be Mr. Sunshine to the media, but I'm not sure
there is a better pitcher in the NL than Kevin Brown. And you can
be sure his popularity among teammates soared the other day in
Denver when he plunked the Colorado Rockies' Todd Helton in
retaliation for Sheffield getting drilled earlier in the game. ...
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach State's very own version of Martha Stewart, the
lovely Dede Rossi, reports that the recent Jewels of the Night gig
raised a record $150,000 for the school's athletic scholarship
fund. Incredibly, a dinner with me at Phil Trani's Restaurant was
auctioned off for a mind-boggling, sanity-defying $550. Two couples
whose names won't be revealed to spare them public ridicule shared
in the bid. ...
</P>
<P>
   Gee, I can't wait to go to the National Sports Collectors show
now going on at the Anaheim Convention Center through Sunday to pay
Johnny Bench $125 to sign a jersey, or Magic Johnson $180 to sign a
basketball, or Reggie Jackson $220 to sign a bat.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, on second thought, I think I might blow $10 to have
one of my all-time idols, Honky Tony Man, ink his John Hancock on a
piece of paper for me. Once one of Southern California's biggest
athletic heroes, Roman Gabriel is also charging a mere $10 for his
autograph, a reflection of how fleeting fame can be. ...
</P>
<P>
   The fight publicist, Honest John Beyrooty, called excitedly from
Phoenix ON Thursday to inform me that ravaged, over-the-hill,
38-year-old Julio Cesar Chavez has worked himself into the best
shape of his career for Saturday night's Showtime match against
Kostya Tszyu at Veterans Memorial Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   So what?
</P>
<P>
   Who can ever forget the marvelous shape Muhammad Ali got into
for his ill-starred match against Larry Holmes?
</P>
<P>
   Chavez should have retired after quitting against Oscar De La

GIMELSTOB UPSETS PHILIPPOUSSIS
</HEADLINE>
 
Eds: Leads with night match (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GERRY GITTELSON  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hometown hero Justin Gimelstob pulled off the
biggest upset of the Mercedes-Benz Cup, knocking off top-seeded
Mark Philippoussis 3-6, 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-3) in Thursday's second
round at UCLA's L.A. Tennis Center.
</P>
<P>
   Unseeded Gimelstob, formerly of UCLA, had lost to Philippoussis
in two previous meetings, but he got the best of the hard-hitting
Australian in key situations.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't a matchup for purists. Long rallies were few and far
between as both employed a similar combination of overpowering
serves and aggressive passing shots. It was more like a boxing
match than anything Bill Tilden would have conjured up.
</P>
<P>
   Philippoussis got off to a better start, surging ahead 4-1, then
ending his 6-3 first-set victory with consecutive aces, the last a
136-mph crowd-pleaser.
</P>
<P>
   But Gimelstob wasn't particularly intimidated. He rebounded by
holding service six consecutive times to force a tiebreaker, then
rallying from a two-point deficit in the tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
   SURPRISING RESULTS: The media has been consistently focusing on
the missing persons of this event, starting on Monday when
top-seeded Andre Agassi, by far the tournament's biggest name,
withdrew because of a lingering back injury.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Wednesday, Davis Cup player Vince Spadea dropped out
(overhydration) and Marcelo Rios was defaulted for cussing out an
official.
</P>
<P>
   Tournament director Bob Kramer might be reeling, but he's doing
his best not to show it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are actually working out better than I expected,''
Kramer said. ``(Before the tournament started), ticket sales were
up 30 percent from last year and we're having some nice weather.
Our plan is to have 46 good matches and so far the tennis has been
good and exceeded our expectations. That's the way things are; you
might want to ask me again later in the week.''
</P>
<P>
   CRAZY FROM THE HEAT? Wayne Ferreira needed almost 2 hours _ in
100-degee heat _ to defeat Paradorn Srichaphan on Wednesday
afternoon. Nevertheless Ferreira took time immediately afterward to
hit a few shots with youngsters from the Southern California Tennis
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a nice experience for the kids and it exposes the
SCTA programs to all the spectators,'' spokesman Toby Zwikel said.
</P>
<P>
   PASSING SHOT: Defending Mercedes champion Pete Sampras, who
decided not to participate this year, was spotted tossing a
football with some the UCLA football players at the practice field
ajacent to the tennis stadium.
</P>
<P>
   THAT WAS QUICK: Jason Stoltenberg of Australia and Orlando,
Fla., needed just 50 minutes to eliminate Goichi Motomura 6-1, 6-2
in the second round. &QL;

GUNMAN FREES HOSTAGE PILOTS AFTER ESCAPE OF PRISONERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout)   By ANDY NEWMAN and SHAILA K. DEWAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A man carried a handgun onto a National Airlines jet
at Kennedy International Airport at 10:15 on Thursday night,
shushed the passengers and walked calmly into the cockpit, taking
the pilot and co-pilot hostage for two hours, passengers and the
authorities said. Neither the seven crew members nor the 143
passengers were injured in the incident, the Port Authority of New
York and New Jersey said.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman released the pilot around midnight with a list of
demands, including his wish to speak to someone from the Argentine
Consulate, the police said. An off-duty officer at the Argentine
Consulate, Beatriz Bustos, said that a police officer called and
asked her to put him in touch with the Argentine ambassador,
Guillermo McCough. She said she passed the message on, but had no
further information.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman released the co-pilot around 1 a.m., the authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing the man with the gun heading for the cockpit, all
the passengers rushed off the plane and escaped unharmed,
passengers and Greg Trevor, a Port Authority spokesman, said.
</P>
<P>
   As of 1:30 on Friday morning, the authorities said, the gunman
was alone on the plane, a Boeing 757 that was to have left for Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Many passengers described scenes of pandemonium. ``I sat down,
got buckled up and the next thing I know everybody was screaming,''
said Misty Nichols, 27, a nurse from Carmel, N.Y., who was leaving
for a vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Then, she said, people started rushing to get off the plane. A
little girl next to her was knocked over, she said, but an older
man picked her up and helped her.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols said she later tried to retrieve some of her belongings,
but someone yelled, ``Get off the plane _ your life is more
important than your stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Weiss, another passenger, told CNN that he was sitting
near the front of the first-class section when he ``heard a voice,
a very low voice, saying `Be quiet.''' He said that he looked up
and saw ``a dark-skinned man in his late 20s with a 10- to 12-inch
gun in his right hand, walking very briskly toward the cockpit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He walked into the cockpit and closed the door,'' Weiss said.
The man was wearing a white long-sleeved shirt and did not appear
to be an airline employee, at least not one in uniform, Mr. Weiss
and some other passengers said.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman apparently made his way onto the plane, at Gate 33 of
Terminal 4W, simply by running past security workers, Mr. Trevor of
the Port Authority said.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers said they had to pass through only one metal detector
before boarding the plane, and it was located right before the
jetway.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the suspect pulled his gun out right before the
metal detector, told four elderly people to get out of his way and
boarded the plane.
</P>
<P>
   CNN reported that a National Airlines spokesman had said the
gunman was a ticketed passenger on the flight. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moments after all the passengers left the plane, several police
officers with ``big guns'' boarded, Nichols said.
</P>
<P>
   The flight, National Airlines Flight 19, a Boeing 757, was
scheduled to take off at 9:30 p.m. but did not begin boarding until
after 10 p.m., passengers said.
</P>
<P>
   One passenger, who was not identified, told ABC News that the
man held the gun down in front of him with both hands to make it
clear to passengers that he was armed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me to be quiet,'' the passenger said. I grabbed my
friends and we just piled off the plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Another passenger, Frank Clark, 30, a computer engineer from
Brooklyn, was in first class and had just been served a drink when
he heard the commotion and saw the gunman enter the cockpit. The
passenger sitting next to Clark said, ``The guy's got a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all it took,'' Clark said. ``It was a road race from
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all the passengers appeared to panic, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy sitting next to me really tripped me out because he
kept his drink,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said that airline employees and security personnel at the
terminal seemed completely baffled by the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The passengers were running down the jetway, and the two
airline people at the ticket counter were bugged out,'' he said.
``They had no idea what to do. There was security guy was waving
people towards an exit, the other one was just standing there like
he just steppped on a rake.''
</P>
<P>
   National, formed a year ago and based in Las Vegas, is a small
airline, with a fleet of 11 Boeing 757-200's flying nonstop between
Las Vegas and eight other cities. But it is growing fast.
</P>
<P>
   It began turning a profit in March, after only 10 months in the
air, becoming one of the fastest new airlines in history to make
money, according to Aviation Daily, a trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   National operates four flights a day from Kennedy Airport to Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The airline itself declined to comment on the crisis. But CNN
reported that a National Airlines spokesman had said the gunman was
a ticketed passenger on the flight. &QL;

ubiquity, relentless aw-shucks hokeyness and stupidity at toxic
levels, the prize goes hoofs-down to ``Cow Parade,'' a herd of

SPARKS GET REVENGE ON SEATTLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The Sparks got even, blowing the expansion
Seattle Storm out of the Forum on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   A lot has changed since these teams last met. With a handful of
games remaining, the Sparks are the WNBA's leading team and the
Storm has the league's worst record. This time the Sparks left no
room for error as they won their seventh consecutive game and final
regular-season home game 76-63 in front of 6,455.
</P>
<P>
   The victory gave the Sparks (23-3) a full-game lead over their
next opponent, the three-time defending champion Houston Comets
(22-4), who were idle Thursday. That game begins a six-game road
trip. The next time the Sparks play in the Forum will be in the
playoffs. In the meantime, they will be trying to hold down the No.
1 seed for home-court advantage throughout the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we come,'' Sparks coach Michael Cooper said about heading
to play Houston in a nationally televised game Saturday. ``We've
beaten them twice this year and I'm pretty sure they've had this
date penciled in and here we come.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday the Sparks were repaying the Storm for their 69-58
overtime loss in Seattle back in June.
</P>
<P>
   This time the Storm had no answer for the Sparks, who got
double-figuring scoring from five players. Sparks center Lisa
Leslie, a serious candidate for league's most valuable player, had
18 points and seven rebounds. DeLisha Milton had 13 points and
Mwadi Mabika, who celebrated her 24th birthday Thursday, Tamecka
Dixon and Allison Feaster had 10 points apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a well-played game by Seattle,'' Cooper said. ``I
thought we did a good job of getting out on them. We were able to
get into our rhythm. The last time we played they took away our
inside game. This time we were able to get our high-low game
going.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks shot 49 percent and held down the edge on the boards
35-21.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted them because they beat us twice,'' said Mwadi, who
was adding the exhibition loss to Seattle. ``They never give up,
even if we go up by 20. We stayed focus and got the win.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Leslie: ``I thought we did a good job of taking it inside
to them. They had some really long players, but I thought we were
very aggressive, especially on the boards and getting offensive
rebounds, so that probably put us over the top in terms of post
play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks fell behind 6-2 but later stretched out a tight game
with an 8-0 run to go up 21-16, while the Storm was held to one
field goal in five minutes. Tamecka Dixon made a 10-footer and
followed it with a 3-pointer to give the Sparks a 10-point lead.
They never looked backed as they took a 39-26 advantage into the
break.
</P>
<P>
   They shot 52 percent in the period with DeLisha Milton leading
the way with nine points, Leslie with eight and Dixon with seven.
Milton did not miss in four attempts from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Sonja Henning had a career-high 19 points for Seattle. She was 6
of 10 from the 3-point line. &QL;

MARINERS SKID REACHES THREE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ While Safeco Field starts to show its age, the
Mariners are starting to show their vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   Cast in the shadow of a 17-minute delay when the Safeco Field
lights began to systematically go out, the Mariners' 101st game of
the season Thursday night showcased a struggling offense.
</P>
<P>
   Another in a series of unproductive offensive nights was broken
only by a two-run rally in the fifth inning that gave Seattle a 2-1
lead over Toronto. That lead evaporated in a rare implosion on the
part of left-handed reliever Arthur Rhodes as the Blue Jays came
roaring back, scoring five times in the seventh to claim a 7-2
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're struggling offensively; we need to pick it up,'' manager
Lou Piniella said. ``It happens to everybody. Teams better than
this have gone through the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing you can do is go out again tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The manager said he hopes that the recent flurry of speculations
regarding possible deals _ the trade deadline arrives Monday _
haven't had an impact on his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to stand here and say that's the reason,''
Piniella said. ``The trade deadline comes around every year; every
team has to go through it. But sometimes you can lose focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may talk to them about that tomorrow. We need our focus.''
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen's focus was on trying to protect the 2-1 lead
inherited from starter John Halama. The relief corps, strong all
year, wasn't Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to take over from reliever Jose Paniagua in the seventh
with one out and no one on, Rhodes gave up two hits and an
intentional walk to load the bases. Rhodes got the inning's second
out with a pop fly, but after going 0-2 against pinch-hitter Todd
Greene, Rhodes gave up a single up the middle for two runs and a
3-2 Blue Jays lead.
</P>
<P>
   One walk later, Rhodes (3-5) was gone. His replacement, Jose
Mesa, struggled as well. Alex Gonzalez singled in two runs, and a
third scored on an error charged to third baseman David Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh off their first losing series at Safeco Field in almost
two months against Oakland, the Mariners now have lost three in a
row at home _ matching the club's longest losing streak of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway through the home-stand, the Mariners have actually lost
a game on the four-game lead they brought home, and would be
looking at a two-game slippage had not the A's blown a 4-3 lead in
the late going against Boston in Oakland Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing is that teams are going to come after you when
you're in first place,'' Piniella said. ``We're in first, and they
came after us pretty good tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners are 7-8 since the All-Star break, and in six of the
13 games they've scored two runs or less, including three times in
the past five games at home.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle put together a couple of doubles, by Dan Wilson and
Rickey Henderson, for one run and a subsequent Alex Rodriguez
single for another in a two-run fifth. The rest of the night was a
struggle against Esteban Loaiza, making just his second start for
the Jays after being dealt north by Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners lefty John Halama entered the game a winner in two of
his three July starts. Although he put runners on base by the
bushel, he pitched competitively.
</P>
<P>
   A two-out RBI double by Carlos Delgado in the first inning
earned the Blue Jays a run, but they didn't get much after that
because Halama, whose best success comes working down in the strike
zone, stayed down.
</P>
<P>
   As long as he was down in the zone, he was able to get
double-play grounders. And it was those double-play grounders,
accrued in the first, third and fifth innings, that were
instrumental in keeping the Blue Jays from mounting a concerted
charge.
</P>
<P>
   At least until the seventh. The seventh inning has been a
problem child for the Mariners, who have been been outscored 75-50
in the seventh this year, by far the team's worst scoring
differential in any inning.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes was one strike away from getting out of the inning when
he was 0-2 against Greene, but after Greene fought back to get even
in the count at 2-all, things were never the same. Greene took the
Blue Jays from behind to ahead with one swing, and Rhodes and Mesa
had trouble keeping back the floodwaters after that.

ANGELS RALLY FALLS SHORT AGAINST WHITE SOX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Angels got the Chicago White Sox' full
arsenal Thursday night _ home runs, a deluge of hits, stolen bases,
hit-and-run plays, the works _ and still managed to get the tying
run to the plate in the bottom of the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   But that's where it stayed, and the White Sox escaped with a 6-5
win in front of a crowd of 24,394 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   With the win, Chicago regained its distinction of having
baseball's best record: 63-39.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was another great comeback,'' said Angels manager Mike
Scioscia, after Anaheim spotted the White Sox a 6-0 lead after only
4{ innings before scrambling back to make it a game.
``Unfortunately, it fell short.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the Angels' seventh one-run game in their last 12, and
the wear is beginning to show. The Angels have lost three games in
a row, matching their longest losing streak of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets to be a grind,'' Scioscia acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   This was a bigger grind than most.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox unloaded 18 hits on the Angels, including a pair
of two-run home runs by Herbert Perry and Chris Singleton, both off
of loser Brian Cooper (4-5).
</P>
<P>
   They were the ninth and 10th home runs allowed this season by
Cooper, but he's been tagged for six in his last four starts, over
18 innings. He was raked for 10 hits in 42/3 innings after giving
up 10 hits in 31/3 innings his previous start against Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the second consecutive rough start for (Cooper),''
Scioscia said. ``He never got his feet on the ground. His whole
thing is command, location ... and he had trouble with his command.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the team you want to struggle with your command.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put pressure on you in every phase of the game ... they
run, they hit-and-run, they go the other way, they hit the long
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   And they take advantage of other club's misfortunes. Such as the
Angels helping out with three errors and a passed ball. Even a fan
in the right-field bleachers helped out, reaching out and getting a
hand on a drive in the fourth inning by Brook Fordyce, just enough
to knock it away from Tim Salmon. Instead of a double Fordyce wound
up with a triple and, one batter later, he scored on a passed ball.
</P>
<P>
   The only consolation for Scioscia, the fan was removed from the
stands.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox' lead was 4-0 when Cooper appeared to escape a
two-on, nobody-out jam in the fifth, when Paul Konerko grounded
into a double play. But Singleton followed with his eighth homer _
and second of the season off of Cooper _ and the lead was suddenly
6-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, meantime, were restricted to three singles in the
first four innings by Chicago's Jon Garland, at 20, the youngest
pitcher in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not so concerned as I am cautious,'' White Sox manager
Jerry Manuel said when asked if he had concern over his young
pitching staff. ``There's still a lot to be done, a ways to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never been here (this far in first place) before,
there's no history. With youth what you get is the unexpected. It
brings energy, but it also brings the unexpected.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the fifth, when the Angels came to life with four runs, a
rally that started when Garland walked the first two batters.
</P>
<P>
   Darin Erstad, who drove in three runs for the night to give him
76 RBI for the season, singled home two in the fifth-inning rally.
</P>
<P>
   Garland regained his touch in the sixth, retiring the Angels in
order, then turned it over to the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels left two on in the seventh, another in the eighth
and, in the ninth, Adam Kennedy led off with a triple off closer
Keith Foulke. Erstad got Kennedy home with a one-out sacrifice fly
_ after fouling off five successive 0-2 pitches _ but Kevin Stocker
flied to center to end it. &QL;

LOCAL BOY DOES GOOD AGIANST ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HEATHER GRIPP  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Jerry Manuel didn't care that his starting
pitcher was only 20 years old, had a losing record, an 8.22 ERA and
was making his hometown debut in just his fifth major-league
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago White Sox manager knew that the pitcher was Jon
Garland and reminded skeptics of the right-hander's habit of
remaining poised and playing beyond his years. Pitching in front of
family and friends _ in a stadium where he grew up attending games
_ wouldn't be any more of a challenge than anything Garland had
accomplished to get there, Manuel figured.
</P>
<P>
   Garland didn't disappoint.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander, who made a rapid rise through the minors after
being a first-round draft pick of the Chicago Cubs out of Kennedy
High of Granada Hills, Calif., in 1997, was in control early during
his start Thursday against the Angels at Edison Field, a game the
White Sox won 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   Garland gave up five hits and two earned runs in six innings to
improve to 2-2 and show why Manuel considers him a key factor in
Chicago's ability to maintain the best record in the major leagues
and its large lead in the American League Central.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jon Garland's obviously the type, he might get emotional, but
I don't think he'll go overboard,'' Manuel said before the game.
``He's the same guy that was recalled from A-ball to pitch in the
Triple-A World Series. I think it'll be a good nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Garland began by striking out one of the league's top hitters,
Darin Erstad, on three pitches. The crowd of Garland supporters
seated along the first-base line had reason to keep cheering as the
White Sox defense allowed Garland to get through the first two
innings facing the minimum number of batters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't find myself in awe,'' Garland said. ``It's just like
pitching anywhere, I try to keep my team in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Garland, throwing in the low 90s with a sinker that was working
better than in recent games, routinely got ahead in counts and was
able to induce ground balls to quickly erase baserunners for four
shutout innings. None of the Angels' five baserunners through the
first four innings advanced past first.
</P>
<P>
   A leadoff walk to Kevin Stocker in the fourth drew a visit from
pitching coach Nardi Contreras. Garland responded by retiring the
heart of the Angels' lineup in order.
</P>
<P>
   Garland, who had lasted more than 41/3 innings in just one of
his previous four starts, saw his luck begin to turn in the fifth
inning. He walked the first two batters, but was hurt just as much
by two errors, which led to four runs, two of which were unearned.
</P>
<P>
   Reminiscent of his days as a high school All-American, Garland
remained composed and retired the side in order in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an impressive effort by him to continue to pitch the
way he did,'' Manuel said. ``Even though he gave up the walks,
after the errors, he seemed to take it up another notch. It was
good to see.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the type of outing the White Sox envisioned when they
traded for him in 1998 and that has made him one of Baseball
America's top prospects each year since he turned pro.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps fellow Southern California product Jim Parque was right
about the value of coming home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good feeling,'' said Parque, who is scheduled to start
the final game of the series Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   After cruising through the International League for the first
few months of this season _ his nine wins led the league at the
time of his promotion and his 2.26 ERA with Charlotte is still a
league best _ Garland made his major-league debut July 4 and was
greeted with rough times.
</P>
<P>
   He gave up seven earned runs for a loss in his first game and
five earned runs for another loss last weekend. His only other win
came July 17 against Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   At 20 years old, Garland fits right in on a team with an average
age of less than 27 years. Garland is used to being the youngest,
though. Before becoming the youngest White Sox pitcher in 15 years
to make his major-league debut, he was the youngest player in the
International League. In 1999, he was the youngest player in the
Southern League.
</P>
<P>
   Garland spent most of last year at Single-A Winston Salem and
Double-A Birmingham before being promoted to Triple-A Charlotte in
September. He made three playoff starts for the International
League champions, going 1-0 with a 3.18 ERA. His eight strikeouts
in Game 3 against Vancouver set a Triple-A World Series record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt real good to be here,'' Garland said. ``I had a lot of
people here. But you try to do this every game.'' &QL;

 PM-CONCORDE-CRASH-0728-COX &HT;    FUEL PUMP IN AFTERBURNER OF DOOMED CONCORDE REPLACED BEFORE
FLIGHT CRASH, NEWSPAPER REPORTS
 &HT;    (1000&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GONESSE, France _ Mechanics replaced a fuel pump in the
afterburner equipment in two left-side engines of the doomed Air
France Concorde hours before the aircraft took off from a Paris
airport, a French newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Citing Air France sources, Le Parisien said that the lengthy
repair to engine No. 2 was made in the morning before the afternoon
take-off. Engine No. 2 is the engine that burst into flames as the
supersonic Concorde took off before crashing into flames killing
113 about two minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   Air France refused to respond to the newspaper's story.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde is the only passenger aircraft to have
afterburners, which are common on supersonic military jets.
Afterburners inject fuel into hot jet engine exhaust gases
providing the explosive power for take-off.
</P>
<P>
   Le Parisien quoted an unidentified mechanic as saying: ``The
afterburner pump pushes out a great volume of fuel at high
pressure. If it goes wrong or breaks, there's a risk it can turn
the back of the engine into a real blowtorch.''
</P>
<P>
   Government investigators said Thursday that the aircraft lost
power in two of its four engines as it was taking off, and the
flight crew was unable to retract the aircraft's landing gear.
</P>
<P>
   The swan-like supersonic aircraft also left pieces of tire on
the runway and had dropped debris along the 4-mile trajectory of
its brief flight, the French Bureau of Accident Investigation, or
BEA, also said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Readings from one of the so-called ``black boxes'' recovered
from the aircraft indicated that the left No. 1 engine
malfunctioned as the Concorde rotated for take-off. This engine was
next to the No. 2 engine, which also received a replacement reverse
thruster just before take-off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aircraft was in flight for less than one minute when the
parameters of engine No. 1 decreased again, the plane lurched
strongly to the left and crashed,'' the BEA said. ``In the sound
recording, we noted that the crew announced a problem in engine No.
2 and a little later they said the undercarriage would not come up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flight data recorder shows that on take-off engine No. 2
lost power to the point that it stopped, and that engine No. 1
temporarily lost power,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Tower controllers told the pilots that flames were streaming
from the rear of the plane during take-off, but the Concorde was
traveling too fast to halt the flight, the BEA said.
</P>
<P>
   A French aviation engineer who serves as an official adviser to
French courts said initial findings suggested that a tire might
have exploded on take-off sending pieces into an engine, setting
off a chain reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can have ingestion of foreign objects in the engines, and
then you have problems in the
</P>
<P>
   engine,'' Raymond Auffray told the BBC.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Thursday, Air France's remaining five Concorde's
remained grounded today as the investigation progressed. British
Airways, the only other airline to fly the high-speed transport
planes, resumed its Concorde flights between New York and London
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The BEA _ the French equivalent of the U.S. National
Transportation Safety Board _ is studying about 600 pieces of
technical information including mechanical readings and the
aircraft's altitude, speed and position contained in the black
boxes recovered from the aircraft, which crashed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Government experts have extracted all the information from the
flight data and cockpit voice recorders, the BEA said Thursday,
adding that it planned to finish a preliminary report at the end of
August.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said it was unclear how soon the data would yield
more clues about what caused the crash that killed 113 people when
the Concorde crashed into a small hotel near Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Experts also intend to study the amateur video aired Wednesday
on television news reports to determine if, for example, the color
and size of the flames can determine the temperature and source of
the fire, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde was carrying 100 passengers _ 96 Germans, two
Danes, an American and an Austrian _ and nine French crew members.
Two Polish women were among the four people killed on the ground.
Six members of one German family died in the crash, including a
10-year-old boy and a seven-year-old girl, the newspaper France
Soir reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Before the BEA report was released, Auffray, the aviation
expert, told La Croix newspaper that evidence and observations
suggested that an engine turbine blade might have failed. He told
the newspaper that investigators should focus on turbine blades
inside both Rolls-Royce engines under the left wing.
</P>
<P>
   Auffray said the pilots' loss of control indicates that a
ruptured blade may have caused the engine to break up inside.
</P>
<P>
   Local government officials said Thursday that the bodies of all
113 victims had been recovered from the wreckage and transferred to
a medical institute in Paris for examination. Most were burned
beyond recognition in the inferno, and can only be identified by
dental records or DNA tests.
</P>
<P>
   After remains were removed, about 40 forensic experts in
white-hooded suits continued working in the drizzle to comb the
charred crash site for anything _ wedding rings, teeth, scraps of
clothing _ that might help identify the victims. ``The bodies are
terribly mutilated, and some are so badly burned that it's
impossible to recognize them,'' Fabien Tillon, a spokesman at the
regional police headquarters, told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Mourners, including high-level officials from the French and
German governments, streamed into the beautiful Madeleine Church in
central Paris to pay their respects to the victims. It is the same
church where Parisians gathered to pray after the death of Princess
Diana here in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The church, which holds about 1,000 people, was filled with
uniformed Air France pilots, cabin crew and other staff and the
families of many of those who died. German relatives of the
victims, some holding one another for support, arrived in buses
provided by the Paris Airports Authority. Many wore dark glasses in
the bright summer sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Outside the church, a priest in purple and white robes greeted
mourners. Passers-by laid bunches of flowers in tribute. President
Jacques Chirac, who did not attend the service, sent a large
bouquet of pale pink roses and other flowers.
</P>
<P>
   A priest began the service with these words: ``We are gathered
here united in our pain and if possible, united in our hope.''
</P>
<P>
   At Charles de Gaulle airport, where the Concorde took off
Tuesday on its journey to New York, travelers and Air France
employees observed a moment of silence. A similar ceremony took
place at Orly Airport, Paris' other major airport which is served
by Air France.
</P>
<P>
   Air France said Thursday it would pay $20,000 each to surviving
families to help defray immediate expenses such as funeral costs.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Genosse, a working-class town of 20,000, plan to
hold a silent march to the crash site Friday. Merchants said they
would close shop to honor the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, the Val d'Oise region prosecutor officially
opened an investigation into the accident to determine whether
charges could be brought for ``involuntary homicide and involuntary
injury.''
</P>
<P>
   And French newspapers reported that investigators had seized
maintenance documents relating to the repair work on the engine's
thrust reverser. Such an investigation is not unusual in France
following such a large accident.

 &HT;    AMWEST VOWS TO FLY RIGHT(a)

<TEXT>
<P>
   America West Airlines, facing unprecedented customer wrath and
lost business for repeated delays and cancellations, is cutting
flights and beefing up maintenance and baggage operations in a
dramatic bid to improve service.
</P>
<P>
   The moves come a week after the Tempe-based airline, the
nation's ninth-largest, reported a drop in second-quarter profits
due, in part, to service snafus. It was the second straight quarter
the airline's bottom line has taken a hit from flight problems. The
service shortcomings go back much further, however: America West
has ranked at or near the bottom of industry on-time rankings for
more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   Maintenance issues also got the company into trouble with the
Federal Aviation Administration, culminating in a $2.5million fine
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue here is we haven't been operating a reliable
airline,'' said Doug Parker, America West president. ``We have been
working as hard as we possibly could to figure out what the issues
were and to get them addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   America West came up with a long list of fixes, detailed in a
major announcement Thursday. Most center on maintenance operations,
the root of its flight delays and cancellations. The company said
it plans to temporarily add two maintenance lines, increase
overnight repair teams and automate spare-parts routing.
</P>
<P>
   Those moves will take time to show up at the gate, so America
West also came up with a more immediate fix: fewer flights.
Beginning Tuesday, the airline will temporarily cut its daily
flight schedule from 880 to 863 to free up four more planes to
serve as spares. That will give America West a total of eight
spares.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have extra aircraft sitting on the ramp,''
Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   If there's a problem with the scheduled aircraft, ``that plane
will roll up and take customers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   America West is cutting only one route: Columbus, Ohio, to Los
Angeles. The other cuts will involve reduced frequencies. For
example, the number of flights between Phoenix and Kansas City,
Mo., and between Phoenix and Oakland will be reduced from five to
four per day.
</P>
<P>
   Affected passengers will be notified and rebooked.
</P>
<P>
   Parker promises that America West customers will notice
improvements immediately. He said cutting flights is a ``''very
expensive'' way to fix the problem - fewer planes in the air means
fewer paying passengers - but acknowledged that America West is
left with few choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers and our employees aren't going to give us six to
12 months (to beef up maintenance), and we're not going to ask that
they do,'' he said. ``We're going to fix this now.''
</P>
<P>
   Valley attorney and sports agent Rick Erickson already ran out
of patience with America West. He stopped flying America West in
January after years as a regular customer. Not only were his
flights often canceled or delayed, but employees were
unsympathetic, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need someone holding my hand the whole time, but you
do expect a little respect,'' Erickson said.
</P>
<P>
   The last straw for Erickson was when he was late to an NFL
players union meeting in Washington because of an America West
flight delay.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts applauded America West's moves, but called
them long overdue. The service woes have cost the airline lucrative
business travelers in a time of strong demand, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``America West has been struggling to achieve any semblance of
operational reliability for close to a year now,'' said Sam
Buttrick, airline analyst with PaineWebber in New York.
``Management has been talking about reliability, and now it looks
like they're going to put some money into it.''
</P>
<P>
   James Higgins, who follows America West for Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette in New York, said the moves will hurt the company's
profits in the short term, but should eventually pay off.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Continental Airlines has found, frequently when you spend a
little more money on crucial service-related areas, you more than
make up for it on the revenue side,'' he said. ``I think this is
where America West is headed.''
</P>
<P>
   The FAA praised America West's move.
</P>
<P>
   FAA spokesman Roland Herwig said the agency did not order the
company to reduce flights, and the moves have nothing to do with an
ongoing FAA safety audit of America West maintenance. All of the 10
major airlines are being audited in the wake of an Alaska Airlines
crash in January.
</P>
<P>
   FAA officials this winter threatened to block America West from
adding planes until it improved its maintenance record, but later
backed off.
</P>
<P>
   Key union leaders criticized America West initiatives, saying
the moves fall short of what's needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The announcement you have today is not nearly enough. It's the
tip of the iceberg,'' said Roger Cox, head of the Air Line Pilots
Association at America West, which is negotiating a new contract.
</P>
<P>
   Bill McGlashen, Association of Flight Attendants local
president, said the union is troubled by the flight reductions
because it could hurt job security if the flights aren't restored.
</P>
<P>
   Parker said the reduced schedule will be in force until America
West's problems are fixed.
</P>
<P>
   McGlashen praised America West for plans to add maintenance and
baggage staff but said it should have been done much sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish senior management would listen to the folks that are
running the operations and would have listened to them long ago,''
the union leader said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why it has taken America West so long to seriously tackle
its service problems, at least publicly, Parker said the underlying
maintenance issues were complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken us some time to truly understand what is needed to
do it,'' Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   America West went wrong, he said, by not growing its maintenance
operations along with its flight schedule over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   The airline has been on a steep growth curve the past five
years, adding 47 percent more aircraft and increasing daily flights
by 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although the reduction in flights means America West will grow
by 5 percent rather than the planned 10 percent this year, Parker
said the cutbacks don't mean America West is veering from its
long-trumpeted growth plan or conceding that it grew too fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The growth has been the absolute right strategy for the
airline,'' he said, citing strong earnings growth until recently.
``We haven't implemented well.''

 &HT;    FUEL PUMP IN AFTERBURNER OF DOOMED CONCORDE REPLACED BEFORE
FLIGHT CRASH, NEWSPAPER REPORTS
 &HT;    (1000&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GONESSE, France _ Air France denied a newspaper report Friday
that mechanics replaced a fuel pump in the afterburner equipment in
two left-side engines of the doomed Concorde hours before the
aircraft took off from a Paris airport.
</P>
<P>
   The airline said its mechanics performed routine daily
maintenance on the Concorde the day it crashed but said that the
afterburner pump on the No. 2 engine was not replaced. The airline
said the maintenance ended with tests of all four of the Concorde's
engines.
</P>
<P>
   The airline also expressed criticism of media speculation
swirling around the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the wake of the tragedy, Air France deplores unfounded and
wrong reporting in the press.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing Air France sources, Le Parisien said that the lengthy
repair to engine No. 2 was made in the morning before the afternoon
take-off. Engine No. 2 is the engine that burst into flames as the
supersonic Concorde took off before crashing into flames killing
113 about two minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde is the only passenger aircraft to have
afterburners, which are common on supersonic military jets.
Afterburners inject fuel into hot jet engine exhaust gases
providing the explosive power for take-off.
</P>
<P>
   Le Parisien quoted an unidentified mechanic as saying: ``The
afterburner pump pushes out a great volume of fuel at high
pressure. If it goes wrong or breaks, there's a risk it can turn
the back of the engine into a real blowtorch.''
</P>
<P>
   Government investigators said Thursday that the aircraft lost
power in two of its four engines as it was taking off, and the
flight crew was unable to retract the aircraft's landing gear.
</P>
<P>
   The swan-like supersonic aircraft also left pieces of tire on
the runway and had dropped debris along the 4-mile trajectory of
its brief flight, the French Bureau of Accident Investigation, or
BEA, also said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Readings from one of the so-called ``black boxes'' recovered
from the aircraft indicated that the left No. 1 engine
malfunctioned as the Concorde rotated for take-off. This engine was
next to the No. 2 engine, which also received a replacement reverse
thruster just before take-off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aircraft was in flight for less than one minute when the
parameters of engine No. 1 decreased again, the plane lurched
strongly to the left and crashed,'' the BEA said. ``In the sound
recording, we noted that the crew announced a problem in engine No.
2 and a little later they said the undercarriage would not come up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flight data recorder shows that on take-off engine No. 2
lost power to the point that it stopped, and that engine No. 1
temporarily lost power,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Tower controllers told the pilots that flames were streaming
from the rear of the plane during take-off, but the Concorde was
traveling too fast to halt the flight, the BEA said.
</P>
<P>
   A French aviation engineer who serves as an official adviser to
French courts said initial findings suggested that a tire might
have exploded on take-off sending pieces into an engine, setting
off a chain reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can have ingestion of foreign objects in the engines, and
then you have problems in the
</P>
<P>
   engine,'' Raymond Auffray told the BBC.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Thursday, Air France's remaining five Concorde's
remained grounded today as the investigation progressed. British
Airways, the only other airline to fly the high-speed transport
planes, resumed its Concorde flights between New York and London
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The BEA _ the French equivalent of the U.S. National
Transportation Safety Board _ is studying about 600 pieces of
technical information including mechanical readings and the
aircraft's altitude, speed and position contained in the black
boxes recovered from the aircraft, which crashed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Government experts have extracted all the information from the
flight data and cockpit voice recorders, the BEA said Thursday,
adding that it planned to finish a preliminary report at the end of
August.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said it was unclear how soon the data would yield
more clues about what caused the crash that killed 113 people when
the Concorde crashed into a small hotel near Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Experts also intend to study the amateur video aired Wednesday
on television news reports to determine if, for example, the color
and size of the flames can determine the temperature and source of
the fire, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde was carrying 100 passengers _ 96 Germans, two
Danes, an American and an Austrian _ and nine French crew members.
Two Polish women were among the four people killed on the ground.
Six members of one German family died in the crash, including a
10-year-old boy and a seven-year-old girl, the newspaper France
Soir reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Before the BEA report was released, Auffray, the aviation
expert, told La Croix newspaper that evidence and observations
suggested that an engine turbine blade might have failed. He told
the newspaper that investigators should focus on turbine blades
inside both Rolls-Royce engines under the left wing.
</P>
<P>
   Auffray said the pilots' loss of control indicates that a
ruptured blade may have caused the engine to break up inside.
</P>
<P>
   Local government officials said Thursday that the bodies of all
113 victims had been recovered from the wreckage and transferred to
a mediurch, which holds about 1,000 people, was filled with
uniformed Air France pilots, cabin crew and other staff and the
families of many of those who died. German relatives of the
victims, some holding one another for support, arrived in buses
provided by the Paris Airports Authority. Many wore dark glasses in
the bright summer sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Outside the church, a priest in purple and white robes greeted
mourners. Passers-by laid bunches of flowers in tribute. President
Jacques Chirac, who did not attend the service, sent a large
bouquet of pale pink roses and other flowers.
</P>
<P>
   A priest began the service with these words: ``We are gathered
here united in our pain and if possible, united in our hope.''
</P>
<P>
   At Charles de Gaulle airport, where the Concorde took off
Tuesday on its journey to New York, travelers and Air France
employees observed a moment of silence. A similar ceremony took
place at Orly Airport, Paris' other major airport which is served
by Air France.
</P>
<P>
   Air France said Thursday it would pay $20,000 each to surviving
families to help defray immediate expenses such as funeral costs.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Genosse, a working-class town of 20,000, plan to
hold a silent march to the crash site Friday. Merchants said they
would close shop to honor the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, the Val d'Oise region prosecutor officially
opened an investigation into the accident to determine whether
charges could be brought for ``involuntary homicide and involuntary
injury.''
</P>
<P>
   And French newspapers reported that investigators had seized
maintenance documents relating to the repair work on the engine's
thrust reverser. Such an investigation is not unusual in France
following such a large accident.

 &HT;    EMBARGOED UNTIL SUNDAY, JULY 30, 2000
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Ignore the polls before the conventions, but not after
 &HT;    By Martin Gottlieb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The people who are in charge of explaining American politics to
the American people don't understand American politics.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just the journalists. The academics who advise the
journalists on politics _ to whom the journalists so often turn for
quotes and interviews _ help shape the prevailing journalistic
views.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the politicians themselves, and their aides, their
pollsters and their media advisers have the same perspective. It's
the entire political subculture we're talking about.
</P>
<P>
   And the views of that subculture have been sold to the American
people.
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing view of politics prevails so thoroughly, so
universally, that it is not even seen as a view or a theory. It is
seen as common sense, as obvious. If it is never challenged, that
is partly because there seems to be nothing to challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Just for the sake of argument, though, let's say that what
prevails is only a theory. That theory has several tenets.
</P>
<P>
   It starts with the premise that campaigns are what determine the
outcomes of elections, at least in reasonably close elections.
</P>
<P>
   If, in the spring of 2000, we _ the experts think _ don't know
who will win the presidential election of 2000, then, obviously,
the outcome will be determined by events that haven't happened yet;
that is, that will happen during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The surface appeal of that logic is overwhelming. That the logic
is not questioned is not surprising.
</P>
<P>
   The political analysts also believe _ almost as a subset of
their belief in the importance of campaigns _ that American
politics is substantially about the manipulation of public opinion
through the manipulation of images. It's about who puts together a
good television ad or a successful ``media event'' or, generally,
an appealing image.
</P>
<P>
   They also believe events that happen during a campaign but are
really outside of the campaign can have an effect on the outcome.
Will the economy tick up or down in October? Might there be a
last-minute scandal? A new foreign crisis?
</P>
<P>
   In sum, the emphasis is always on what happens next _ or is said
next or put before the voters next.
</P>
<P>
   The most common answer offered by a political expert during a
campaign to a question about how the election will turn out is some
version of, ``It all depends'' upon how things go from here.
</P>
<P>
   Intuition tells us that an answer so hedged could hardly be
wrong. But, in fact, such an answer is almost always wrong.
</P>
<P>
   LOOK TO PAST, NOT FUTURE
</P>
<P>
   What will determine which candidate gets the majority of the
votes is not future events but past events.
</P>
<P>
   The reason some people are undecided even in the summer of an
election year is not that the crucial events haven't happened yet;
it is that voters haven't focused upon those events yet, at least
as to their relevance to politics. At a certain stage _ much later
than the so-called experts generally realize _ voters come to terms
with the fact that an election is actually coming. But they do not
start paying respectful attention to the baloney of campaigns.
Instead they think, OK, setting the campaign aside, how are things
going for the country _ roughly, in general _ compared to
reasonable expectations?
</P>
<P>
   If these voters decide one way, the incumbent party wins; the
other, the challenging party wins.
</P>
<P>
   In making the case for the above proposition, let's start with
this question: If campaigns don't count, why do people think they
do? The answer is clear: the polls. The poll numbers ``move''
during the campaign year. Therefore, the assumption goes, people
must be paying attention to campaign events.
</P>
<P>
   (If campaigns always ended the way they start out looking in the
polls, nobody would be surprised and the universally accepted
explanation would be that the voters don't pay any attention to
politicians during campaigns. It would seem obvious.)
</P>
<P>
   But does movement in polls mean anything? Let's look at the
course of the polls in 1992. Bill Clinton was doing badly for most
of the year, relative not only to George Bush but to Ross Perot. A
Washington Post and ABC poll in late April showed Bush at 36
percent, Clinton at 31 and Perot at 30. It was, remember, the
pathetic condition of the Democrats _ confronted with an apparently
vulnerable president _ that fostered Perot's entry into the race in
the first place. All the big-name Democrats had decided not to seek
the presidency, and Clinton was winning the nomination by
semi-default over a weak field, despite being damaged by the draft,
adultery and Whitewater issues and the resulting widespread qualms
about his character.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democratic convention _ which came before that of the
GOP _ resulted in a huge gain for Clinton. He came away with a big
lead, which he never lost. A CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll, which had
Clinton behind Bush by 8 percentage points a couple of weeks before
the Democratic convention, had him ahead by 18 after.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Clinton's surge seemed to a lot of people like just
another turn in a tumultuous political situation. After all, in
early 1991, when the American military drove Iraq's Saddam Hussein
out of Kuwait, George Bush's approval rating in the polls soared
toward 90 percent. In the end, though, Bush got only 39 percent of
the popular vote, though his opponents were damaged and dubious.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, Perot had come out of nowhere, gone up to 40
percent in match-ups with the other candidates and dropped back
below 20 percent before rising again.
</P>
<P>
   Some people in the media and politics talk about the changes in
Bush's standing as changes in the public ``mood.'' But are the
American people really so ``moody'' as to think in the spring of
1991 that Bush's presidency was a success and by the late summer of
1992 that just about anybody any party might nominate could do
better? After all, not much happened concretely between mid-1991
and late 1992, other than the passage of time after the military
victory, and the fact that the American economy improved, which
normally would be expected to move the numbers in favor of the
president.
</P>
<P>
   POLLS MEASURE INCLINATIONS
</P>
<P>
   If these changes in the polls reflected changes in the public's
mood, the country had a bigger problem than the deficit, crime,
drugs, poverty and family break-up combined. It had an electorate
that, if it were an individual, would be a candidate for
mood-controlling drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, however, what many polls measure is not moods but
vague inclinations. The pollsters are getting top-of-the-head,
shrug-of-the-shoulder responses about a question voters haven't
focused on.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called experts are always quick to say election polls
provide only a ``snap shot'' of the electorate's views. But even
that metaphor grossly overstates the usefulness of early campaign
polls. What we are likely to get, really, is a blurry, awful,
underdeveloped snap shot, one in which we can't even tell what
we're looking at.
</P>
<P>
   Came the summer of 1992. Why did Clinton get a great boost in
the polls out of his convention, while Bush failed to get the usual
``bounce'' out of the Republican convention? (A Washington Post and
ABC poll concluded that Bush got a six-point ``bump,'' but other
polls showed even that evaporating in a few days, which is not the
norm with these things.)
</P>
<P>
   The political media addressed this question head-on at the time
and generally concluded that many Americans had found the
Republican convention off-putting. Pat Buchanan _ Bush's opponent
in the primaries _ had given a prime-time speech about the
necessity off ``taking back'' the country from forces corrupting
its culture. Other speakers had concentrated on assaulting the
Democrats, especially on ``family values.'' It all seemed so
negative, or so this theory goes. ``GOP Sees Its Stress on Values
Backfire'' was the headline on a Boston Globe analysis on Aug. 27.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic convention, on the other hand, evoked the future
and embraced everybody, giving off warm vibes.
</P>
<P>
   But the GOP convention of 1992 was run by roughly the same
people as the successful conventions of 1980, 1984 and 1988. In
1988, they had a candidate _ George Bush _ who went into the
convention season having been way behind in the polls for a year.
He came out of his convention ahead and _ like every candidate
since 1948 who has come out of the conventions with a clear lead _
remained ahead all the way.
</P>
<P>
   It's a little hard to believe Republican masters of media
manipulation had simply lost their touch by 1992.
</P>
<P>
   COMPLETING THE PICTURE
</P>
<P>
   A better theory: Public opinion about Clinton in 1992 was not
well formed before the conventions, but opinion about Bush was.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had not spent much time on the national stage, and when
he was there he was mainly dealing with embarrassments relating to
sex and the draft. At the convention, however, the American people
saw other sides of him. They saw a major national party embrace him
enthusiastically. They saw his accomplishments highlighted, and
they saw him behave presidentially. In short, they saw _ if not a
guy they just had to have _ at least a respectable alternative to
the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   And the swing voters were more than open to the idea of change.
The economy had been sour through almost all of Bush's term; when
it wasn't in recession, it was growing only weakly. The deficit was
out of control. The crack-cocaine epidemic had fostered a crime
wave. Almost all the measures of a society's success were going the
wrong way (except in the area of foreign policy).
</P>
<P>
   And the government wasn't doing much about it. Before Bush
became president, the term ``gridlock'' referred to road traffic;
on his watch, it became a political term.
</P>
<P>
   There comes a time when more talk can't do much. That was what
happened to Bush in the summer of 1992. The public had made up its
mind about him before the conventions. It just had not decided
whether Clinton was a respectable alternative.
</P>
<P>
   A comparison with 1988 makes the point. Then-Vice President
George Bush's numbers could be moved by the GOP convention because
he was still a fuzzy figure to the public. Having been in Ronald
Reagan's enormous shadow for eight years, he was widely seen as
some sort of ``wimp.'' The ``wimp factor'' was the subject of a
news magazine cover story. But the convention highlighted a
substantive career, the high regard in which Bush was held by many
notable people, and his military record.
</P>
<P>
   In a year when the country was doing well, the swing voters were
ready to stick with the incumbent party. They just weren't sure
Bush was a respectable choice. But conventions can just about
always convince people that a nominee is a respectable choice,
because he just about always is.
</P>
<P>
   If we are talking about ``convincing,'' are we talking about
media manipulation, after all? No. All the Democratic convention of
1992 and Republican convention of 1988 did was the inevitable: They
completed the pictures of the candidates. They didn't successfully
sell the public bills of goods about alleged supermen.
</P>
<P>
   Running a convention is not rocket science. If you're the
incumbent party, you emphasize how good things are or you try to
change the subject away from how bad things are. If you're the
challenging party, you emphasize how bad things are or try to
change the subject away from how good things are.
</P>
<P>
   Whether your arguments resonate depends upon how things actually
are. That's the heart of the matter, and the judgment of the
American people is almost always clear after the conventions and
often not clear before them.

 &HT;    EMBARGOED UNTIL SUNDAY, JULY 30, 2000

 &HT;    Ignore the polls before the conventions, but not after
 &HT;    By Martin Gottlieb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The people who are in charge of explaining American politics to
the American people don't understand American politics.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just the journalists. The academics who advise the
journalists on politics _ to whom the journalists so often turn for
quotes and interviews _ help shape the prevailing journalistic
views.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the politicians themselves, and their aides, their
pollsters and their media advisers have the same perspective. It's
the entire political subculture we're talking about.
</P>
<P>
   And the views of that subculture have been sold to the American
people.
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing view of politics prevails so thoroughly, so
universally, that it is not even seen as a view or a theory. It is
seen as common sense, as obvious. If it is never challenged, that
is partly because there seems to be nothing to challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Just for the sake of argument, though, let's say that what
prevails is only a theory. That theory has several tenets.
</P>
<P>
   It starts with the premise that campaigns are what determine the
outcomes of elections, at least in reasonably close elections.
</P>
<P>
   If, in the spring of 2000, we _ the experts think _ don't know
who will win the presidential election of 2000, then, obviously,
the outcome will be determined by events that haven't happened yet;
that is, that will happen during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The surface appeal of that logic is overwhelming. That the logic
is not questioned is not surprising.
</P>
<P>
   The political analysts also believe _ almost as a subset of
their belief in the importance of campaigns _ that American
politics is substantially about the manipulation of public opinion
through the manipulation of images. It's about who puts together a
good television ad or a successful ``media event'' or, generally,
an appealing image.
</P>
<P>
   They also believe events that happen during a campaign but are
really outside of the campaign can have an effect on the outcome.
Will the economy tick up or down in October? Might there be a
last-minute scandal? A new foreign crisis?
</P>
<P>
   In sum, the emphasis is always on what happens next _ or is said
next or put before the voters next.
</P>
<P>
   The most common answer offered by a political expert during a
campaign to a question about how the election will turn out is some
version of, ``It all depends'' upon how things go from here.
</P>
<P>
   Intuition tells us that an answer so hedged could hardly be
wrong. But, in fact, such an answer is almost always wrong.
</P>
<P>
   LOOK TO PAST, NOT FUTURE
</P>
<P>
   What will determine which candidate gets the majority of the
votes is not future events but past events.
</P>
<P>
   The reason some people are undecided even in the summer of an
election year is not that the crucial events haven't happened yet;
it is that voters haven't focused upon those events yet, at least
as to their relevance to politics. At a certain stage _ much later
than the so-called experts generally realize _ voters come to terms
with the fact that an election is actually coming. But they do not
start paying respectful attention to the baloney of campaigns.
Instead they think, OK, setting the campaign aside, how are things
going for the country _ roughly, in general _ compared to
reasonable expectations?
</P>
<P>
   If these voters decide one way, the incumbent party wins; the
other, the challenging party wins.
</P>
<P>
   In making the case for the above proposition, let's start with
this question: If campaigns don't count, why do people think they
do? The answer is clear: the polls. The poll numbers ``move''
during the campaign year. Therefore, the assumption goes, people
must be paying attention to campaign events.
</P>
<P>
   (If campaigns always ended the way they start out looking in the
polls, nobody would be surprised and the universally accepted
explanation would be that the voters don't pay any attention to
politicians during campaigns. It would seem obvious.)
</P>
<P>
   But does movement in polls mean anything? Let's look at the
course of the polls in 1992. Bill Clinton was doing badly for most
of the year, relative not only to George Bush but to Ross Perot. A
Washington Post and ABC poll in late April showed Bush at 36
percent, Clinton at 31 and Perot at 30. It was, remember, the
pathetic condition of the Democrats _ confronted with an apparently
vulnerable president _ that fostered Perot's entry into the race in
the first place. All the big-name Democrats had decided not to seek
the presidency, and Clinton was winning the nomination by
semi-default over a weak field, despite being damaged by the draft,
adultery and Whitewater issues and the resulting widespread qualms
about his character.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democratic convention _ which came before that of the
GOP _ resulted in a huge gain for Clinton. He came away with a big
lead, which he never lost. A CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll, which had
Clinton behind Bush by 8 percentage points a couple of weeks before
the Democratic convention, had him ahead by 18 after.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Clinton's surge seemed to a lot of people like just
another turn in a tumultuous political situation. After all, in
early 1991, when the American military drove Iraq's Saddam Hussein
out of Kuwait, George Bush's approval rating in the polls soared
toward 90 percent. In the end, though, Bush got only 39 percent of
the popular vote, though his opponents were damaged and dubious.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, Perot had come out of nowhere, gone up to 40
percent in match-ups with the other candidates and dropped back
below 20 percent before rising again.
</P>
<P>
   Some people in the media and politics talk about the changes in
Bush's standing as changes in the public ``mood.'' But are the
American people really so ``moody'' as to think in the spring of
1991 that Bush's presidency was a success and by the late summer of
1992 that just about anybody any party might nominate could do
better? After all, not much happened concretely between mid-1991
and late 1992, other than the passage of time after the military
victory, and the fact that the American economy improved, which
normally would be expected to move the numbers in favor of the
president.
</P>
<P>
   POLLS MEASURE INCLINATIONS
</P>
<P>
   If these changes in the polls reflected changes in the public's
mood, the country had a bigger problem than the deficit, crime,
drugs, poverty and family break-up combined. It had an electorate
that, if it were an individual, would be a candidate for
mood-controlling drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, however, what many polls measure is not moods but
vague inclinations. The pollsters are getting top-of-the-head,
shrug-of-the-shoulder responses about a question voters haven't
focused on.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called experts are always quick to say election polls
provide only a ``snap shot'' of the electorate's views. But even
that metaphor grossly overstates the usefulness of early campaign
polls. What we are likely to get, really, is a blurry, awful,
underdeveloped snap shot, one in which we can't even tell what
we're looking at.
</P>
<P>
   Came the summer of 1992. Why did Clinton get a great boost in
the polls out of his convention, while Bush failed to get the usual
``bounce'' out of the Republican convention? (A Washington Post and
ABC poll concluded that Bush got a six-point ``bump,'' but other
polls showed even that evaporating in a few days, which is not the
norm with these things.)
</P>
<P>
   The political media addressed this question head-on at the time
and generally concluded that many Americans had found the
Republican convention off-putting. Pat Buchanan _ Bush's opponent
in the primaries _ had given a prime-time speech about the
necessity off ``taking back'' the country from forces corrupting
its culture. Other speakers had concentrated on assaulting the
Democrats, especially on ``family values.'' It all seemed so
negative, or so this theory goes. ``GOP Sees Its Stress on Values
Backfire'' was the headline on a Boston Globe analysis on Aug. 27.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic convention, on the other hand, evoked the future
and embraced everybody, giving off warm vibes.
</P>
<P>
   But the GOP convention of 1992 was run by roughly the same
people as the successful conventions of 1980, 1984 and 1988. In
1988, they had a candidate _ George Bush _ who went into the
convention season having been way behind in the polls for a year.
He came out of his convention ahead and _ like every candidate
since 1948 who has come out of the conventions with a clear lead _
remained ahead all the way.
</P>
<P>
   It's a little hard to believe Republican masters of media
manipulation had simply lost their touch by 1992.
</P>
<P>
   COMPLETING THE PICTURE
</P>
<P>
   A better theory: Public opinion about Clinton in 1992 was not
well formed before the conventions, but opinion about Bush was.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had not spent much time on the national stage, and when
he was there he was mainly dealing with embarrassments relating to
sex and the draft. At the convention, however, the American people
saw other sides of him. They saw a major national party embrace him
enthusiastically. They saw his accomplishments highlighted, and
they saw him behave presidentially. In short, they saw _ if not a
guy they just had to have _ at least a respectable alternative to
the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   And the swing voters were more than open to the idea of change.
The economy had been sour through almost all of Bush's term; when
it wasn't in recession, it was growing only weakly. The deficit was
out of control. The crack-cocaine epidemic had fostered a crime
wave. Almost all the measures of a society's success were going the
wrong way (except in the area of foreign policy).
</P>
<P>
   And the government wasn't doing much about it. Before Bush
became president, the term ``gridlock'' referred to road traffic;
on his watch, it became a political term.
</P>
<P>
   There comes a time when more talk can't do much. That was what
happened to Bush in the summer of 1992. The public had made up its
mind about him before the conventions. It just had not decided
whether Clinton was a respectable alternative.
</P>
<P>
   A comparison with 1988 makes the point. Then-Vice President
George Bush's numbers could be moved by the GOP convention because
he was still a fuzzy figure to the public. Having been in Ronald
Reagan's enormous shadow for eight years, he was widely seen as

because he just about always is.

   &UR; WILD ABOUT HARRY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By STEPHEN KING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)
</P>
<P>
   I read the first novel in the Harry Potter series, ``Harry
Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,'' in April 1999 and was only
moderately impressed. But in April 1999 I was pretty much all
right. Two months later I was involved in a serious road accident
that necessitated a long and painful period of recuperation.
</P>
<P>
   During the early part of this period I read Potters 2 and 3
(``Chamber of Secrets,'' ``Prisoner of Azkaban'') and found myself
a lot more than moderately wowed. In the miserably hot summer of
'99, the Harry Potters (and the superb detective novels of Dennis
Lehane) became a kind of lifeline for me.
</P>
<P>
   During July and August I found myself getting through my
unpleasant days by aiming my expectations at evening, when I would
drag my hardware-encumbered leg into the kitchen, eat fresh fruit
and ice cream and read about Harry Potter's adventures at Hogwarts,
a school for young wizards (motto: ``Never tickle a sleeping
dragon'').
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, I awaited this summer's installment in J.K.
Rowling's magical saga with almost as much interest as any
Potter-besotted kid. I had enjoyed the first three, but had read
the latter two while taking enough painkillers to levitate a horse.
This summer, that's not the case.
</P>
<P>
   I'm relieved to report that Potter 4 _ ``Harry Potter and the
Goblet of Fire'' _ is every bit as good as Potters 1 through 3.
It's longer, though. ``Goblet'' is as long as ``Chamber'' and
``Prisoner'' combined.
</P>
<P>
   Is it more textured than the first three? More
thought-provoking? Sorry, no. Are such things necessary in a
fantasy-adventure aimed primarily at children and published in the
lush green heart of summer vacation? Of course not. What kids on
summer vacation want _ and probably deserve _ is simple,
uncomplicated fun. ``Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' brings
the fun, and not just in stingy little buckets. At 734 pages,
``Goblet'' brings it by the lorry load.
</P>
<P>
   The most remarkable thing about this book is that Rowling's
punning, one-eyebrow-cocked sense of humor goes the distance. At
700-plus pages, one should eventually tire of Blast-Ended Skrewts,
Swedish Short-Snout dragons and devices like the Quick-Quotes Quill
(a kind of magical tape recorder employed by the satisfyingly
repugnant Daily Prophet reporter Rita Skeeter), but one never does.
At the least this reader did not.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's because Rowling doesn't dwell for long on such
amusing inventions as the Quill, which floats in midair and bursts
out with florid bits of tabloid prose at odd moments. She gives the
reader a quick wink and a giggle before hustling him or her along
again, all the while telling her tale at top speed. We go with this
willingly enough, smiling bemusedly and waiting for the next nudge,
wink and raised eyebrow.
</P>
<P>
   Puns and giggles aside, the story happens to be a good one. We
may be a little tired of discovering Harry at home with his
horrible aunt and uncle (plus his even more horrible cousin,
Dudley, whose favorite PlayStation game is Mega-Mutilation Part 3),
but once Harry has attended the obligatory Quidditch match and
returned to Hogwarts, the tale picks up speed.
</P>
<P>
   In a Newsweek interview with Malcolm Jones, Rowling admitted to
reading Tolkien rather late in the game, but it's hard to believe
she hasn't read her Agatha Christie and Dorothy L. Sayers. Although
they bear the trappings of fantasy, and the mingling of the real
world and the world of wizards and flying broomsticks is
delightful, the Harry Potter books are, at heart, satisfyingly
shrewd mystery tales.
</P>
<P>
   Potter 3 (``Azkaban'') dealt with Harry's parents (like all good
boy heroes, Harry's an orphan) and cleared up the multiple
mysteries of their deaths in a way that would likely have pleased
Ross Macdonald, that longtime creator of hidden pasts and
convoluted family trees.
</P>
<P>
   Now, returning to Hogwarts after attending the Quidditch World
Cup, Harry and his friends are excited to learn that the Triwizard
Tournament is to be reintroduced after a hiatus of 100 years or so
(too many of the young contestants wound up dead, it seems).
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring wizards from two other schools (Beauxbatons and the
amusingly fascistic Durmstrang Academy, location unknown) have been
invited to spend the year at Hogwarts and compete in the contest,
which is composed of three beautifully imagined tasks. These can
only be performed well by contestants who can solve the riddles
that bear on them; both children and students of Greek mythology
will enjoy this aspect of Rowling's tale.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Sorting Hat, one of Rowling's early ingenious bits of
invention, the Goblet of Fire is essentially a choosing device.
It's supposed to spit out three flaming bits of parchment bearing
the names of the three contestants in the tournament, one entrant
from each school. In a vivid and marvelously tense scene, the
Goblet of Fire spits out four parchment fragments instead of three.
The fourth, of course, bears the name of Our Hero.
</P>
<P>
   Although Harry is supposedly too young to compete in such a
dangerous series of tilts, the Goblet has spoken, and of course
Harry must step into the arena. If you think young readers won't
lap this up, you never had one in your house (or were one
yourself).
</P>
<P>
   Adults are apt to be more interested in just how Harry's name
got into the Goblet in the first place. This is a mystery Rowling
works out with snap and verve. And, unlike the denouements I
remember from the Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys mysteries of my youth,
where the culprit usually turned out to be some vile tramp of the
lower classes, the solution to the Goblet mystery, like the answers
to the Triwizard riddles, struck me as fair enough.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Rowling gives us Harry's first date (not with the
alluring fifth-level dream girl Cho Chang, unfortunately), at least
one thought-provoking subplot (involving house-elves who rather
enjoy their status as kitchen slaves) and an extremely large dose
of adolescent humor (one mildly off-color joke, punning on the word
Uranus, will likely go over the heads of most grade-school readers
and amuse the brighter junior high school set). There's also a
moderately tiresome amount of adolescent squabbling. Adults can
safely speed through these bits; it's a teen-age thing.
</P>
<P>
   Can anyone wonder at the fabulous sales success of these books?
The Harry Potter series is a supernatural version of ``Tom Brown's
Schooldays,'' updated and given a hip this-is-how-kids-really-are
shine. And Harry is the kid most children feel themselves to be,
adrift in a world of unimaginative and often unpleasant adults _
Muggles, Rowling calls them _ who neither understand them nor care
to. Harry is, in fact, a male Cinderella, waiting for someone to
invite him to the ball.
</P>
<P>
   In Potter 1, his invitation comes first by owl (in the magic
world of J.K. Rowling, owls deliver the mail) and then by Sorting
Hat; in the current volume it comes from the Goblet of Fire,
smoldering and shedding glamorous sparks. How nice to be invited to
the ball! Even for a relatively old codger like me, it's still nice
to be invited to the ball.
</P>
<P>
   It would be depressing to announce that the best-selling book in
the history of the world, a position this book will probably hold
only until Potter 5 comes along, is a stinker. ``Goblet of Fire''
is far from that.
</P>
<P>
   Before Harry appeared on the scene, escape-hungry kids had to
make do with R.L. Stine, the uninspired but wildly successful
journeyman who inspired the ``Goosebumps'' phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Rowling's books are better natured, better plotted and better
written. They bulge with the sort of playful details of which only
British fantasists seem capable: there's the Whomping Willow, which
will smash hell out of your car (and you) if you get too close to
it, snack foods like Cauldron Cakes and Licorice Wands and the
satisfyingly evil Lord Voldemort (so evil, in fact, that most of
Rowling's characters will only call him ``You-know-who'').
</P>
<P>
   The Dursleys, Harry's unpleasant guardians, explain the boy's
long absences by telling their friends that Harry attends St.
Brutus's Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys. And the book
opens with the murder (offstage, don't worry) of a witch named
Bertha Jorkins. Rowling doesn't exactly come out and say it's what
the unfortunate Bertha deserves for taking her vacation in Albania,
but she certainly implies it.
</P>
<P>
   Is there more going on here than fun? Again, not much. In a good
deal of British fantasy fiction, the amusing inventions are
balanced by themes of increasing darkness _ Tolkien's ``Rings''
trilogy, for instance, in which the fascism of Mordor begins as a
distant bad smell on the breeze and develops into a pervasive
atmosphere of dread, or the Narnia books of C.S. Lewis, in which
the writer's religious concerns invest what begin as harmless
make-believe adventures with a significance that becomes, in the
end, almost unbearable (and to this reader, rather tiresome).
</P>
<P>
   Taken to its extreme, the id of British fantasy produces a
Richard Adams, where the unfortunate talking dogs Snitter and Rowf
suffer almost unspeakable hardships and the bear-god Shardik comes
to stand for all the promises religion ever made and then broke;
where every sunlit field of scampering rabbits conceals its shining
wire of death.
</P>
<P>
   In Rowling's work, such shadows can be perceived, but they are
thin shadows, quickly dispelled. Harry's adventures remain for the
most part upbeat and sunny, despite the occasional cold pockets of
gruel; more Lewis Carroll than George Orwell.
</P>
<P>
   The British fantasy they may actually be closest to is J.M.
Barrie's ``Peter Pan.'' Like any school, where the clientele is
perpetually young and even the teachers begin to assume the
immature psychological char acteristics of their pupils, Hogwarts
is a kind of Never-Never Land. Yet Harry and his friends show some
reassuring signs of growing up eventually. In the current volume
there is some discreet necking, and at least a few sorrows and
disappointments that need coping with.
</P>
<P>
   The fantasy writer's job is to conduct the willing reader from
mundanity to magic. This is a feat of which only a superior
imagination is capable, and Rowling possesses such equipment. She
has said repeatedly that the Potter novels are not consciously
aimed at any particular audience or age. The reader may reasonably
question that assertion after reading the first book in the series,
but by the time he or she has reached ``Harry Potter and the Goblet
of Fire,'' it becomes increasingly clear that the lady means what
she says.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can there be any question that her stated refusal to dumb
down the language of the books (the current one is presented with
such British terms as petrol, pub and cuppa unchanged) has lent the
stories an attraction to adults that most children's novels simply
don't have.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the news is good. Harry Potter will soon be appearing at
a multiplex near you. The initial project is being helmed by Chris
Columbus, a filmmaker of no demonstrable ingenuity; one doubts if
the director of ``The Goonies,'' one of the loudest, dumbest and
most shriekingly annoying children's movies ever made, is up to
bringing Rowling's scatty wit and vibrant imagination to the
screen. (I hope, on behalf of the millions of children who love
Harry, Hermione and Ron Weasley, that Columbus will prove me
wrong.)
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy, even that as sturdy and uncomplicated as this Young
Wizard's Progress, is difficult to bring to film, where the wonders
are all too often apt to shrink and become banal. Perhaps Harry
Potter's place is in the imaginations of his readers. And if these
millions of readers are awakened to the wonders and rewards of
fantasy at 11 or 12 ... well, when they get to age 16 or so,
there's this guy named King.
</P>

   (Stephen King's ``On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft'' is coming
out this fall.)

 &HT;    Laura Bush prepares for a very public lifeBy Julie Bonnin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Warm, but straightforward and no-nonsense, like
your favorite grade-school teacher, dressed and polished like the
future U.S. first lady she may yet be, Laura Bush has acknowledged
there are disadvantages as well as advantages to being married to a
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   As first lady of Texas, Bush's pet projects have channeled money
to libraries, literacy programs and young children. In a poor El
Paso neighborhood or at the country club across town, she's treated
like the next best thing to royalty: tortilla vendors, wealthy
businessmen and even Democrats sing her praises.
</P>
<P>
   But as the wife of presidential candidate George W. Bush, the
media throng has gotten thicker; the questions meaner. She was
``reluctant, absolutely,'' to subject her family to the rigors of a
presidential campaign, she said before Bush announced he was
running. In an interview last year, she added, ``I know what the
ugly side of politics is . . . It's very difficult to have bad
things said about the people you love.''
</P>
<P>
   The Woman Who Dared To Be Publicly Hesitant is on the campaign
trail now, ready for the Republican Convention in Philadelphia _
and for months there's been no more confessions of anything other
than full-fledged support for her husband's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to imply that the daughter-in-law of the famously
frank Barbara Bush lacks for candor _ or moxie.
</P>
<P>
   A friend tells about encountering a rain-swollen creek with
Laura Bush, 53, who was going to visit Texas writers Lee and Bobby
Byrd at a ranch outside Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who'd gotten out of the car, could either plunge into the
swirling water or turn back. There was a big grin on her face as
she entered the water. A panicked security officer just behind her
struggled to keep up without submerging his gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``She may have hesitated for about three seconds,'' said Adair
Margo of El Paso. ``Then it was like, plop. All the way.''
</P>
<P>
   And, there she is now _ feet-first in the unpredictable waters
of a political campaign.
</P>
<P>
   She couldn't have foreseen it.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush, the only child of a builder (her mom helped keep the
books for his business), grew up in Midland, Texas, forever
crossing paths with the man she'd eventually marry. They went to
different elementary schools in Midland, but attended the same
junior high for a year. Then he left to attend a prep school on the
East Coast. In the '60s, when she was a teacher and he was flying
fighter jets for the Texas Air National Guard, they lived at
opposite ends of the same apartment complex in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until 1977, when she was working as the librarian at
an Austin elementary school, that friends, Jan and Joey O'Neill,
got the two of them together at a barbecue in Midland when Laura
was home visiting her parents. They'd been trying to arrange the
meeting for nearly two years, recalled Jan O'Neill. Laura, who'd
had plenty of boyfriends, ``was not particularly anxious to be
fixed up,'' said O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was someone who was interested in politics, and
that he would be someone I wouldn't be interested in because I was
so uninterested in politics at that time,'' Laura Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   They fell in love anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was struck by her beauty and her charm,'' George W.
Bush said in an interview in the Governor's office last year. ``She
was an intriguing personality to me . . . We had a whirlwind
courtship and it stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   Their romance came on the heels of that period which has invited
so much speculation about the governor's past. It's as if his life
is split neatly in two sections, with the pre-Laura Bush era
comprising the years when, as Bush has said, he was ``young and
irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Was she the good woman who tamed him, as so many have suggested?
</P>
<P>
   ``Barbara and I were talking about that,'' said the senior
George Bush, in an interview last year. ``We don't remember George
as this kind of wild thing. I don't understand the needless
speculation that he needed somebody to quiet him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand,'' he conceded, ``Laura has been a very
stabilizing influence on our whole family.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Barbara Bush: ``He may have been a playboy and had a lot of
fun . . . She laughed at his jokes. He has enormous admiration for
her.''
</P>
<P>
   And from Gov. Bush: ``I think marriage and children settle
people down, particularly if you take your vows seriously. I did.''
</P>
<P>
   They were both 31. They married three months after they met.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush immediately met two challenges: campaigning across
the Panhandle with her husband, who was making his first run for
office (he lost a race for Congress); and fitting into the extended
Bush family.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime friend Regan Gammon recalled talking with Laura about
the turn her life had taken. ``We discussed the fact that his
father was thinking about running for president and what that might
mean,'' she said. ``How bizarre that was . . . it seemed a little
unreal.''
</P>
<P>
   The family she was marrying into was a huge, competitive clan.
George Bush Sr.'s mother, in particular, was perhaps ``the most
athletic human being living,'' Barbara Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   But Laura never seemed intimidated by her in-laws, Gammon said.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, the matriarch asked the future Laura Bush, ``And
what do you do?''
</P>
<P>
   Her reply, ``I read,'' quieted everyone within earshot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Bush couldn't believe her ears,'' Barbara Bush recalled.
</P>
<P>
   FAMILY FIRST
</P>
<P>
   They were a family first, before they became a public entity,
before everyone from The New York Times to Vogue wanted to tell
their story.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge he and Laura have faced wasn't the '94
governor's race nobody thought he would win, said George W. Bush.
It was the birth of their children, after Laura was ordered to bed
late in her pregnancy. He was in Midland and she was hospitalized
in Dallas when he got the call from her doctor. ``Your children
will be born tomorrow; either that, or your wife's kidneys will
fail.''
</P>
<P>
   He got on a plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``She loves our daughters more than anything,'' he said, ``would
lay her life down for them. And nearly did so at birth . . . She
was absolutely determined to do whatever she could to make sure
those little girls came into the world healthy and safe. And she
did.''
</P>
<P>
   He returned to the story later.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was Laura at her best, kind of hanging on with the
girls.''
</P>
<P>
   She has fond memories of their early years as a family in
Midland, of wheeling the twin girls around in their stroller on hot
summer afternoons as the cicadas trilled loudly.
</P>
<P>
   Now the girls, named for their grandmothers, are 18. Barbara,
following in the footsteps of her father, grandfather and great
grandfather, will attend Yale University in the fall. Jenna has
enrolled at The University of Texas at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush sounded wistful when she spoke about the days when
she could throw her arms around them easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very natural for them at this age to want to spread
their wings, and George and I are certainly aware of that,'' she
said. ``We are aware of how much less relevant we are in our
children's lives each day as they grow up and want to be with their
own friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The girls, whose privacy is zealously protected _ they don't
give interviews and they haven't appeared in campaign
advertisements _ haven't been overly concerned with their father's
political plans, their mother said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like every teen-ager, they are mainly concerned about
what they're going to be doing this weekend; at the same time they
are very proud of their dad.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout their lives, when their grandfather was
vice-president, then president, and when their father became
governor in 1994, the Bushes have ``tried to make a normal life for
our daughters,'' Laura Bush said. Both the former president and
Barbara Bush said they have felt a protective surge as Texas' first
family has moved into the national political arena. But neither
admits to offering any guidance on how to survive a presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I awaken every morning with advice,'' Barbara Bush
joked, ``but I don't give it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bushes have been encouraged by the way the national media
have treated Chelsea Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are some things the girls have not been able to be
shielded from. At a Texas Book Festival event, when hecklers
shouted down former President Bush, ``Jenna walked out of there and
burst into tears,'' Laura Bush said. ``It's hard for a teen-ager
when people yell mean things at your grandfather.''
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult, too, to hear things said about your husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like that's what I dread the most, the criticism, but
also the totally unfounded rumors,'' Laura Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Even a tragic piece of the candidate's wife past has been
campaign fodder: Earlier this year, a tabloid newspaper revealed
details of a fatal car accident 35 years ago in which Laura Bush
was one of the drivers. According to reports, Laura Welch, then 17,
ran a stop sign in Midland, colliding with a vehicle driven by a
high school friend; the teen-age boy was killed.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, who's been more even-tempered on his own
campaign trail than when his father was the target of criticism,
has voiced concerns about his wife, about what she might have to
endure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot easier to be the candidate where people say ugly
things about you than the person who loves the person about which
ugly things are said. I know first-hand,'' he said, before the news
about his wife's decades-old tragedy surfaced. ``I know
first-hand.''
</P>
<P>
   CHECKS AND BALANCES
</P>
<P>
   Depending on your vantage point, they're an odd couple or a
completely complementary pair.
</P>
<P>
   She straightens up when she's nervous, attacking bookshelves and
countertops with zeal. He admits to leaving piles of dirty clothes
and sweaty gym gear in his wake.
</P>
<P>
   She's reserved and shy; he's a fiery extrovert.
</P>
<P>
   Their contrasting personalities _ his high-energy temperament
and her laid-back style _ have provided ``a good check and
balance,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Bush says her daughter-in-law is ``a sort of catalyst in
our family. She brings out the best in us.''
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush says much the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laura has always been a very positive influence on me . . . in
terms of forcing me to ask the right questions. On the occasions
where I drank too much, she reminded me I was drinking too much.
And I listened.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, when everyone else was urging him to run for governor,
Laura Bush was one of the last people to get behind the idea.
</P>
<P>
   She reminded him he was ``living a dream'' as an owner of the
Texas Rangers, he says. Both of them enjoyed their time together
watching games, the Florida Gulf Coast vacations that centered on
spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laura's not the first to say, `Oh boy, let's go do that,' sort
of shovin' me into the limelight,'' the governor says. ``She's the
opposite of that. She says, `Wait a minute, buddy, are you sure?
Are you sure you're going to ask our family to make a life change?
Are you sure that this is something you really want to do?'
</P>
<P>
   ``We grew close during the baseball games because of the amount
of time we spent with each other,'' he says. ``We could think about
things and talk. We grew very close during the (1994) campaign
because it was like we were in combat to a certain extent, fellow
warriors.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush ``is in a life that I don't think she ever
envisioned,'' her husband says. ``But she has seized the
opportunity and made a difference in people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   One of her projects, the Texas Book Festival, has raised nearly
$900,000 for the state library system. Last year, after she
championed early childhood initiatives, the Texas legislature
approved $17 million for preschool reading programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would most like to be known as an advocate for children,''
she says. ``I would like to help parents be well-informed so they
can make great decisions for their young children. I think being a
parent is the most important job any of us will ever have and out
relationships with our families and our children are our most
important relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Her work to empower other families would be expanded if her own

 &HT;    Laura Bush prepares for a very public lifeBy Julie Bonnin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Warm, but straightforward and no-nonsense, like
your favorite grade-school teacher, dressed and polished like the
future U.S. first lady she may yet be, Laura Bush has acknowledged
there are disadvantages as well as advantages to being married to a
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   As first lady of Texas, Bush's pet projects have channeled money
to libraries, literacy programs and young children. In a poor El
Paso neighborhood or at the country club across town, she's treated
like the next best thing to royalty: tortilla vendors, wealthy
businessmen and even Democrats sing her praises.
</P>
<P>
   But as the wife of presidential candidate George W. Bush, the
media throng has gotten thicker; the questions meaner. She was
``reluctant, absolutely,'' to subject her family to the rigors of a
presidential campaign, she said before Bush announced he was
running. In an interview last year, she added, ``I know what the
ugly side of politics is . . . It's very difficult to have bad
things said about the people you love.''
</P>
<P>
   The Woman Who Dared To Be Publicly Hesitant is on the campaign
trail now, ready for the Republican Convention in Philadelphia _
and for months there's been no more confessions of anything other
than full-fledged support for her husband's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to imply that the daughter-in-law of the famously
frank Barbara Bush lacks for candor _ or moxie.
</P>
<P>
   A friend tells about encountering a rain-swollen creek with
Laura Bush, 53, who was going to visit Texas writers Lee and Bobby
Byrd at a ranch outside Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who'd gotten out of the car, could either plunge into the
swirling water or turn back. There was a big grin on her face as
she entered the water. A panicked security officer just behind her
struggled to keep up without submerging his gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``She may have hesitated for about three seconds,'' said Adair
Margo of El Paso. ``Then it was like, plop. All the way.''
</P>
<P>
   And, there she is now _ feet-first in the unpredictable waters
of a political campaign.
</P>
<P>
   She couldn't have foreseen it.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush, the only child of a builder (her mom helped keep the
books for his business), grew up in Midland, Texas, forever
crossing paths with the man she'd eventually marry. They went to
different elementary schools in Midland, but attended the same
junior high for a year. Then he left to attend a prep school on the
East Coast. In the '60s, when she was a teacher and he was flying
fighter jets for the Texas Air National Guard, they lived at
opposite ends of the same apartment complex in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until 1977, when she was working as the librarian at
an Austin elementary school, that friends, Jan and Joey O'Neill,
got the two of them together at a barbecue in Midland when Laura
was home visiting her parents. They'd been trying to arrange the
meeting for nearly two years, recalled Jan O'Neill. Laura, who'd
had plenty of boyfriends, ``was not particularly anxious to be
fixed up,'' said O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was someone who was interested in politics, and
that he would be someone I wouldn't be interested in because I was
so uninterested in politics at that time,'' Laura Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   They fell in love anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was struck by her beauty and her charm,'' George W.
Bush said in an interview in the Governor's office last year. ``She
was an intriguing personality to me . . . We had a whirlwind
courtship and it stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   Their romance came on the heels of that period which has invited
so much speculation about the governor's past. It's as if his life
is split neatly in two sections, with the pre-Laura Bush era
comprising the years when, as Bush has said, he was ``young and
irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Was she the good woman who tamed him, as so many have suggested?
</P>
<P>
   ``Barbara and I were talking about that,'' said the senior
George Bush, in an interview last year. ``We don't remember George
as this kind of wild thing. I don't understand the needless
speculation that he needed somebody to quiet him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand,'' he conceded, ``Laura has been a very
stabilizing influence on our whole family.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Barbara Bush: ``He may have been a playboy and had a lot of
fun . . . She laughed at his jokes. He has enormous admiration for
her.''
</P>
<P>
   And from Gov. Bush: ``I think marriage and children settle
people down, particularly if you take your vows seriously. I did.''
</P>
<P>
   They were both 31. They married three months after they met.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush immediately met two challenges: campaigning across
the Panhandle with her husband, who was making his first run for
office (he lost a race for Congress); and fitting into the extended
Bush family.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime friend Regan Gammon recalled talking with Laura about
the turn her life had taken. ``We discussed the fact that his
father was thinking about running for president and what that might
mean,'' she said. ``How bizarre that was . . . it seemed a little
unreal.''
</P>
<P>
   The family she was marrying into was a huge, competitive clan.
George Bush Sr.'s mother, in particular, was perhaps ``the most
athletic human being living,'' Barbara Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   But Laura never seemed intimidated by her in-laws, Gammon said.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, the matriarch asked the future Laura Bush, ``And
what do you do?''
</P>
<P>
   Her reply, ``I read,'' quieted everyone within earshot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Bush couldn't believe her ears,'' Barbara Bush recalled.
</P>
<P>
   FAMILY FIRST
</P>
<P>
   They were a family first, before they became a public entity,
before everyone from The New York Times to Vogue wanted to tell
their story.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge he and Laura have faced wasn't the '94
governor's race nobody thought he would win, said George W. Bush.
It was the birth of their children, after Laura was ordered to bed
late in her pregnancy. He was in Midland and she was hospitalized
in Dallas when he got the call from her doctor. ``Your children
will be born tomorrow; either that, or your wife's kidneys will
fail.''
</P>
<P>
   He got on a plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``She loves our daughters more than anything,'' he said, ``would
lay her life down for them. And nearly did so at birth . . . She
was absolutely determined to do whatever she could to make sure
those little girls came into the world healthy and safe. And she
did.''
</P>
<P>
   He returned to the story later.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was Laura at her best, kind of hanging on with the
girls.''
</P>
<P>
   She has fond memories of their early years as a family in
Midland, of wheeling the twin girls around in their stroller on hot
summer afternoons as the cicadas trilled loudly.
</P>
<P>
   Now the girls, named for their grandmothers, are 18. Barbara,
following in the footsteps of her father, grandfather and great
grandfather, will attend Yale University in the fall. Jenna has
enrolled at The University of Texas at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush sounded wistful when she spoke about the days when
she could throw her arms around them easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very natural for them at this age to want to spread
their wings, and George and I are certainly aware of that,'' she
said. ``We are aware of how much less relevant we are in our
children's lives each day as they grow up and want to be with their
own friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The girls, whose privacy is zealously protected _ they don't
give interviews and they haven't appeared in campaign
advertisements _ haven't been overly concerned with their father's
political plans, their mother said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like every teen-ager, they are mainly concerned about
what they're going to be doing this weekend; at the same time they
are very proud of their dad.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout their lives, when their grandfather was
vice-president, then president, and when their father became
governor in 1994, the Bushes have ``tried to make a normal life for
our daughters,'' Laura Bush said. Both the former president and
Barbara Bush said they have felt a protective surge as Texas' first
family has moved into the national political arena. But neither
admits to offering any guidance on how to survive a presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I awaken every morning with advice,'' Barbara Bush
joked, ``but I don't give it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bushes have been encouraged by the way the national media
have treated Chelsea Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are some things the girls have not been able to be
shielded from. At a Texas Book Festival event, when hecklers
shouted down former President Bush, ``Jenna walked out of there and
burst into tears,'' Laura Bush said. ``It's hard for a teen-ager
when people yell mean things at your grandfather.''
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult, too, to hear things said about your husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like that's what I dread the most, the criticism, but
also the totally unfounded rumors,'' Laura Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Even a tragic piece of the candidate's wife past has been
campaign fodder: Earlier this year, a tabloid newspaper revealed
details of a fatal car accident 35 years ago in which Laura Bush
was one of the drivers. According to reports, Laura Welch, then 17,
ran a stop sign in Midland, colliding with a vehicle driven by a
high school friend; the teen-age boy was killed.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, who's been more even-tempered on his own
campaign trail than when his father was the target of criticism,
has voiced concerns about his wife, about what she might have to
endure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot easier to be the candidate where people say ugly
things about you than the person who loves the person about which
ugly things are said. I know first-hand,'' he said, before the news
about his wife's decades-old tragedy surfaced. ``I know
first-hand.''
</P>
<P>
   CHECKS AND BALANCES
</P>
<P>
   Depending on your vantage point, they're an odd couple or a
completely complementary pair.
</P>
<P>
   She straightens up when she's nervous, attacking bookshelves and
countertops with zeal. He admits to leaving piles of dirty clothes
and sweaty gym gear in his wake.
</P>
<P>
   She's reserved and shy; he's a fiery extrovert.
</P>
<P>
   Their contrasting personalities _ his high-energy temperament
and her laid-back style _ have provided ``a good check and
balance,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Bush says her daughter-in-law is ``a sort of catalyst in
our family. She brings out the best in us.''
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush says much the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laura has always been a very positive influence on me . . . in
terms of forcing me to ask the right questions. On the occasions
where I drank too much, she reminded me I was drinking too much.
And I listened.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, when everyone else was urging him to run for governor,
Laura Bush was one of the last people to get behind the idea.
</P>
<P>
   She reminded him he was ``living a dream'' as an owner of the
Texas Rangers, he says. Both of them enjoyed their time together
watching games, the Florida Gulf Coast vacations that centered on
spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laura's not the first to say, `Oh boy, let's go do that,' sort
of shovin' me into the limelight,'' the governor says. ``She's the
opposite of that. She says, `Wait a minute, buddy, are you sure?
Are you sure you're going to ask our family to make a life change?
Are you sure that this is something you really want to do?'
</P>
<P>
   ``We grew close during the baseball games because of the amount
of time we spent with each other,'' he says. ``We could think about
things and talk. We grew very close during the (1994) campaign
because it was like we were in combat to a certain extent, fellow
warriors.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush ``is in a life that I don't think she ever
envisioned,'' her husband says. ``But she has seized the
opportunity and made a difference in people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   One of her projects, the Texas Book Festival, has raised nearly
$900,000 for the state library system. Last year, after she
championed early childhood initiatives, the Texas legislature
approved $17 million for preschool reading programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would most like to be known as an advocate for children,''
she says. ``I would like to help parents be well-informed so they
can make great decisions for their young children. I think being a
parent is the most important job any of us will ever have and out
relationships with our families and our children are our most
important relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Her work to empower other families would be expanded if her own
were to occupy the White House. Her self-assured answer to the
oft-asked question: Would Hillary Clinton, or Barbara Bush be a
role model? ``I think I'll just be Laura Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother-in-law can see her there, reveling in the history and
``majesty'' of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a good little nester,'

 &HT;    You can uncover much if you are willing to rake the muck
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ Picking up trash at the annual Marshall
clean-up isn't a problem for me. I guess you could say I've been
nothing but a muckraker all my life.
</P>
<P>
   My first real job was picking up trash off the parking lot of a
foundry that employed about 500 people. It seemed like a good deal
to me, I got paid $40 a week to keep it clean no matter how many
hours I worked. If I could keep it clean by working two hours a
week, that was a cool 20 bucks an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it turned out to be about $2 per hour and, instead of
being cool, it was the absolutely back-breaking task of removing a
short ton of beer bottles and cans from what I unlovingly termed
``Hell's Half Acre.''
</P>
<P>
   That's right, almost all of what I picked up were empty beer
containers.
</P>
<P>
   While we regularly beat ourselves up these days about drugs in
the workforce and talk about how terrible work intoxication can be,
the truth is that in the early '70s no one really cared a bit. The
management of this plant _ now out of business, by the way _ either
did not have a rule or did not care about drinking on the job.
</P>
<P>
   So when the noon-time whistle blew, every employee would stream
out of the plant, head to an automobile and guzzle as much beer as
humanly possible in 30 minutes. If you couldn't do at least a quart
you were a piker and destined to be hounded from the job.
</P>
<P>
   Most people either did two quarts of beer or an entire six-pack
in 30 minutes and still managed to squeeze down a sandwich or two.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, if you will, picking up 5,000 empty quart bottles of
beer each week and you'll get a sense of what I'm talking about. I
got less than a penny for every bottle I picked up. It was not a
great deal.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years later I got an actual full-time job in the
plant and I learned that not everyone drank beer during lunch as I
had first thought.
</P>
<P>
   No, a full half of them were smoking marijuana or doing other
drugs during the noon hour.
</P>
<P>
   My first day on the job I was slipped a marijuana cigarette by a
co-worker _ the same co-worker who would, about 30 minutes later,
be on the other end of a small pot of molten aluminum we were
pouring into a mold.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with 1,200-degree aluminum was enough to make me urge my
fellow employees to ``just say no.'' Let's just say that I avoided
pouring much aluminum after lunch. Not that it hardly mattered, in
the morning everyone had a stumbling hangover, including me.
</P>
<P>
   The plant, which made important parts for Air Force jet fighters
(makes you feel safe, doesn't it?), also used, as an alloy, a great
deal of magnesium, one of the few natural substances that will burn
under water.
</P>
<P>
   So every year or so you would hear a thunderous roar in the
plant and look up to find that the roof was gone, along with a
hand, arm, leg or two. Inspectors, both state and federal, would
come to the plant, taking copious notes, interviewing dozens of
workers and asking thousands of questions. They would investigate
the building from top to bottom and walk away scratching their
heads, wondering what had gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   But never, not once, did they inspect the one place that would
have told them all they needed to know. They never went to the
employee parking lot.

 &HT;    Warm and fuzzy boot camp's a change for the worse
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The notion that some things never change has gone out
the window in the 21st century. Everything changes. If you don't
believe it, look what's happening in the Army, the Navy, the Air
Force and even in the Marines.
</P>
<P>
   According to a story in USA Today, basic training has gone to
what amounts to social promotions in public schools. Everybody
graduates. The new Army is bending over backward to help sad-sack
trainees. Instead of being thrown to the mercy of tough old
sergeants, recruits who arrive too soft and flabby for regular
training get an easier course. The nervous and fearful get
counseling to calm them down.
</P>
<P>
   A Fort Jackson, S.C., colonel says virtually anyone can get
through the eight to 12 weeks of boot camp. Even at Parris Island,
home of the legendary and merciless Marine DI, rules have changed.
``Drill instructors are there for inspiration,'' explains a
brigadier general, a definition that must perplex thousands of
Corps veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Another staple of boot camp gone with the wind is the tough
leather, hard-sole combat boot. Recruits are specially fitted with
running shoes. A Navy officer quoted by USA Today points out that
few recruits have worn boots or even hard-sole shoes in civilian
life. ``If you want to know why young people get shin splints and
blisters in training all you have to do is look on the street or go
to church on Sunday,'' he says. ``Everybody is wearing Nikes.''
</P>
<P>
   The reasons the services have gone soft on boot camp is obvious.
The washout rate under the old system was leaving the ranks
unfilled. Females were dropping out at a rate of 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The news that this generation of recruits isn't up to the mental
and physical rigors of their fathers and grandfathers ought to
raise a red flag about lifestyles in these easy and unhappy times,
especially as they apply to young folks who, after television, get
their only exercise by cruising shopping malls.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure if we could have gotten an army in the field in
time to head off Hitler and Tojo if World War II boot camps had
included specially fitted running shoes and anxiety counseling.
When the World War II draft began a lot of boys and young men were
found to be in poor physical condition, but many more were like my
farm-boy neighbors. After getting up long before daylight to milk
the cows and do chores, they were pleased to find they got to sleep
late in boot camp. By their standards.
</P>
<P>
   During the Korean War my job was running a basic training
company at Camp Rucker. It was a lucky but undistinguished
assignment. While my friends and schoolmates were off shooting and
getting shot at I spent the war ``shoveling sand in Alabama,'' to
paraphrase Gen. Patton.
</P>
<P>
   My company sent three cycles through the 12-week course under
the old rules. That's over 500 recruits. Only one had to be washed
out, and that for a mental condition.
</P>
<P>
   Some arrived fat and flabby. All were nervous and scared. A few
thought they could goof off and get sent home. The old sergeants
refused to coddle them. I recall a young fellow from Pennsylvania
caught with a jaw full of chewing tobacco during an after-breakfast
inspection. His sergeant ordered him to swallow the tobacco and not
get sick when he did. He swallowed and didn't get sick.
</P>
<P>
   In those 12 weeks miracles occurred. The fat ones got lean, the
sloppy got neat, the goof-offs turned proud. They all went home
with new self-esteem. I hope kinder and gentler boot camps aren't
shortchanging our young men and women in the service. The old style
worked pretty well. Thousands of veterans call it the most valuable
experience of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Despite tough old sergeants who showed no mercy, someone _ a
fellow recruit, or sometimes one of the tough old sergeants _ was
there to prop up those having trouble keeping the pace. Every
company had kids who needed help, and usually they got it.
</P>
<P>
   The little fellow from Virginia was an example. He wasn't much
of a physical specimen, had trouble staying in step, and one night
crawled the wrong way on the infiltration course. We could have
washed him out, but everybody pitched in and nudged him along, even
though the Army didn't have special courses.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of basic training, he was given non-combat assignment
in Alaska. He protested. He wanted to go to Korea, to prove
something to himself and his family, he said. I told him orders
couldn't be changed.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, I was taking a Sunday afternoon nap when I heard a
knock on my door. It was the kid from Virginia. ``I hope you won't
be angry,'' he said. ``I got my orders changed to Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   I was stunned. ``How did you do that?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got Uncle Max to change them when I was home on furlough,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who in the hell is Uncle Max?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uncle Maxwell Taylor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Uncle Max was Gen. Maxwell Taylor, World War II hero, chief of
staff of the U.S. Army.
</P>
<P>
   Under interrogation, he let me in on several other family
secrets.
</P>
<P>
   One brother was a West Point graduate, another enrolled in the
Naval Academy. His father commanded the Navy base at Norfolk. He
didn't want to be the black sheep. I was glad we didn't wash him
out.

 &HT;    We don't need government to create cell phone etiquette
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ More than 10 years ago I test drove a 12-cylinder
BMW that cost more than my house.
</P>
<P>
   One of the features packed into this luxury high-performance car
was a hands-free telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The phone wasn't hooked up, but I was told that the voices of
the driver and passengers were picked up clearly by a built-in
microphone. The person on the other end of the conversation was
heard through the car's excellent speaker system, which
automatically muted other signals going to the speakers when the
phone was in use.
</P>
<P>
   I considered this a nifty development. Now I own a hands-free
telephone that doesn't require the purchase of a $150,000 car. It's
a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, America is turning into a nation of Nervous
Nellies determined to have the government protect them from all
risks. Chronically nervous Americans have targeted cell phone use
for government regulation, oversight and criminalization.
</P>
<P>
   A subgroup of the Nervous Nellies are the Wet Blankets who are
determined to dampen any new movement that appears to be catching
on with the public.
</P>
<P>
   Nervous Nellies and Wet Blankets (NNs and WBs) have succeeded in
some places where cell phone use now is banned or regulateapers,
cell phone use in public ranges from outrageously rude to deadly.
The solution, according to NNs and WBs, requires new laws,
penalties, enforcement, prosecution and punishment.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, rather than allow society to develop a code of
accepted behavior, a quaint concept formerly called good manners,
NNs and WBs want the government to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   Some people are upset when they see shoppers using cell phones.
I think it makes good sense. When you get to the store and can't
remember what that third item was, you call home. Cell phones are
handy when someone at home calls when you are shopping and asks you
to pick something up. There may be a time when you don't know if
Italian stewed tomatoesam new to this woodworking hobby so please
bear with me. My sister wants me to construct for her a simple
bench that will be outside in her garden.
</P>
<P>
   She wants it to be six feet long by 12 inches deep and 16 inches
tall. What would be a good wood to use in making this bench? I
thought it best to use some type of hardwood instead of pine so it
will hold together better.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, most of the more enduring outdoor woods are soft and
relatively weak, even weaker than pine. Redwood, western red cedar
and cypress all endure relatively well outdoors, but the
construction will have to be heavier than usual; 8/4 stock
throughout, with a good support in the middle of that six-foot run.
</P>
<P>
   Teak, of course, is the classic outdoor wood, and it is a very
strong wood. Unfortunately it is also a very expensive wood, and
one of the most difficult woods there is to work. It is full of
silica, and thus is very hard on edged tools.
</P>
<P>
   Another woodworker who responded to this question suggested oak
if a hardwood is definitely required. My only experience with oak
in outdoor furniture was a disaster, but perhaps I used the wrong
finish or didn't apply it properly. This fellow recommends ``a
couple of coats of clear or semi-transparent deck stain. Look at
Cabot's Deck Stains for good quality.'' He suggests the same thing
for the softer woods, too.
</P>
<P>
   Another novice woodworker reports he bought a nice jack plane,
``brought it home, put a good start on tuning it, and it didn't
need much. Started fiddling with some old oak. Adjusted it so I had
very fine shavings leaping from its mouth, turned the wood over and
suddenly it is like I got too much blade out and it doesn't want to
go any more. What's up? The grain of the wood seems to want me to
work from the same end on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Determining the direction of grain visually is an extremely
difficult thing, in my experience. Sometimes it's obvious, but very
often it isn't at all obvious.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds to me as though the wood is telling him he's cutting
against the grain. Most of the time if the grain runs in one
direction on a given surface of a board, it will run in the
oppposite direction on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, when your plane is running nicely on one side
and balks on the obverse, the first thing to do is to try planing
from the other direction. If that doesn't work, then the likelihood
is that you've run into some wild figure that has grain going in
every direction.
</P>
<P>
   This is why scrapers and sandpaper were invented.

 &HT;    Veteran gives valuable advice to talented rookies
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This year's group of rookies, featuring Dale Earnhardt Jr. and
Matt Kenseth, was heralded as one of the best in Winston Cup
history. The veteran driver overseeing rookie meetings before the
first practice at each race weekend is Ricky Rudd.
</P>
<P>
   Rudd goes over the difficulties of every track, and advises the
first-year drivers how to handle them.
</P>
<P>
   ``At certain tracks you come in off the banking to enter pit
road, and at other tracks you start driving into pit road on the
backstretch, so it's more of an informative thing and putting them
in the driver's seat on what to look out for and the hazards of all
the different race tracks,'' Rudd said.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford No. 28 driver said he likes helping the rookies, but
also understands they already were talented before they started the
instructional meetings. Nevertheless, the first-year drivers have
gained much respect for Rudd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things like that have sped up my learning curve and kept me
from doing something stupid,'' Stacy Compton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a guy like myself who is so new to all of this, just
learning things like traffic flow in and out of the garage, getting
around the track, stuff that is totally foreign to me as to how I
used to do it, is invaluable,'' Scott Pruett said.
</P>
<P>
   Rudd is this year's instructor because he is the current
president of the Darlington Record Club. Drivers earn entry into
the club by being the fastest qualifier for their respective car
manufacturer each year for the Southern 500 race at Darlington
Raceway.

 &HT;    Tight points race prompts anticipation at Atlanta track
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Atlanta Motor Speedway officials are preparing for what might be
the track's most highly-anticipated Winston Cup race since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   AMS officials held extensive meetings this week to discuss plans
for the Nov. 19 NAPA AutoCare 500. If the Winston Cup points
standings race remain as close as it has, and the sport's biggest
names, including Dale Earnhardt, Jeff Gordon and Dale Jarrett, stay
in contention, the AMS event will attract unprecedented ticket
sales and media attention.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jarrett fans have been calling the track after Jarrett
moved past Earnhardt into the No. 2 position last week. Seven
drivers are within 307 points of leader Bobby Labonte with 15 races
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   AMS has already sold out of infield parking, but tickets are
available for the race.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, five drivers _ Davey Allison, Bill Elliott,
Alan Kulwicki, Kyle Petty and Harry Gant _ were mathematically
eligible for the Winston Cup championship heading into the season
finale at Atlanta. It was also the circuit's debut event for rookie
phenom, Jeff Gordon, and final race for legendary driver Richard
Petty. The late Kulwicki didn't win, but scored enough points to
hoist the Winston Cup trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Busch circuit honors Irwin
</P>
<P>
   In the Busch Series, the No. 42 Chevy is co-sponsored by
BellSouth Mobility. The car was driven by the late Kenny Irwin in
10 Busch races earlier this year. Sterling Marlin will finish out
the final six races on the team's schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The Busch car's number will be switched to No. 01 to honor the
memory of Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny was a great teammate and competitor and is greatly
missed,'' Marlin said. ``Kenny would've wanted us to finish the
season and the team hopes to make him proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Marlin is slated to enter the Busch events at Bristol,
Darlington, Richmond, Charlotte, Memphis and Homestead-Miami.
</P>
<P>
   MB2's sponsor search
</P>
<P>
   There is a remote possibility Johnny Benson could drive his
final race of the season for MB2 Motorsports at the Brickyard 400
on Aug. 5. The organization cannot fund the race team after the
next race without the assistance of a primary sponsor. MB2 is
talking to at least four businesses and could reach an agreement in
the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   If MB2 fails to sign a sponsor, look for Benson to appear as an
interim or relief driver for other teams for the rest of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Benson is under contract with MB2 for the 2001-02 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett makes move back into points race
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the Winston Cup points standings, ``repeat champion''
are two words many NASCAR fans haven't mentioned this season until
now.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jarrett, who won the 1999 title, has come out of nowhere to
threaten again as the stock-car racing's season speeds down its
final stretch.
</P>
<P>
   With 15 races remaining, the Ford No. 88 has slipped past Dale
Earnhardt for the runner-up position in points behind Bobby
Labonte. It's perfect timing for Jarrett, as he is also the
defending champion of the Brickyard 400, which is the next stop for
the major-league circuit on Aug. 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did everything just right here (at Indianapolis) last
year,'' Jarrett said. ``We had a really good car. It was fast on
new tires, and it was fast on old tires. We did the right strategy
and almost everything went just perfect. Hopefully, we can do that
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett is doing the same thing he did to win the title last
year: consistent top-10 finishes (11 in 19 races). It also helps
that no one has raced away with points lead like he did last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Sibling rivalry takes on new meaning behind the wheel
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR is a family affair, especially when it comes to brothers.
Three sets of brothers participate in the top three series of
stock-car racing: the Bodines (Geoffrey and Brett in Winston Cup
and Todd in Busch Grand National), the Wallaces (Rusty and Kenny in
Winston Cup and Mike in Craftsman Trucks), and the Greens (Busch
drivers David, Mark and Jeff).
</P>
<P>
   It is rare when three siblings compete against each other
full-time in one series. In the CarQuest 250 Saturday at St. Louis,
the Green brothers will race against each other for a record 50th
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year has been very special for me in many ways,'' said
Jeff, who leads the Busch points standings. ``Not only has this
been a dream season for me performance-wise, but being able to
reach a milestone with my brothers is preichael Waltrip's worries
are over for at least the next 17 months. The new owner of the his
race team, Jim Smith, revealed his future plans for Ultra
Motorsports. Waltrip and crew chief Bobby Kennedy will be retained
through the 2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, however, did announce some immediate changes: For the
last five races of this season, Waltrip will switch from a Chevy to
a Ford and use Penske engines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love our driver, we love our crew chief, and we love
working with our sponsor,'' said Smith, who bought the team from
Jim Mattei.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the switch to Ford will give us the best race car,
and the switch to Penske will give us the best engines,'' Smith
said. ``If we're going to be the best _ and, believe me, that is
our top priority _ then we need to have the best on our side. We
think this is a giant step in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Needed: Crew chief, driver
</P>
<P>
   Long-time Winston Cup team owner Junie Donlavey will announce a
new driver and crew chief within several days.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie driver Ed Berrier and crew chief Dean Johnson left the
No. 09 Ford team last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the hard work that everyone has put into this program,
we were not getting the results we know we can produce,'' Donlavey
said. ``It's not any one person's fault. Everyone put forth their
best effort but there was a lack of chemistry on this team, and Ed
and Dean and I agreed that it would be best for everyone if we
ended the relationship and moved forward.''
</P>
<P>
   No contest in the Busch Series
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Dale Jarrett had the Winston Cup championship wrapped
up by mid-summer, while the Busch title went down to the
next-to-the-last event. This season, the opposite is happening on
the two circuits.
</P>
<P>
   While as many as 10 contenders are battling it out on the top
circuit, Jeff Green leads the Busch standings by a whopping 552
points.
</P>
<P>

LONE VOICE NO MATCH FOR MACHINE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa , Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   So, this new telephone
mysteriously shows up in the mail along with a note from the phone
company thanking us for ordering Caller ID. I ask around the house.
There has been no order, no interest at all in getting Caller ID.
<TEXT>
<P>
   We try not to encourage phone companies. For a long time the
automatic response has been, ``No thank you. We do not want to
change phones or phone companies.''
</P>
<P>
   But this bugs me. I don't want the service. I don't want the
phone. I don't want to pay to send the phone back.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the deal is if you order Caller ID, for which you
will be charged a certain extra sum every month on the phone bill,
they send you a new phone as a bonus.
</P>
<P>
   I call the phone company to tell them I don't want either. But
you don't just call the phone company any more. You enter voice
mail hell.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has the phone company convinced the rest of us we need
voice mail, it has built its own impenetrable fortress. Sometimes
we like voice mail. It's a great way to slither when you don't
really want to talk to someone but need to go on record as at least
making the attempt.
</P>
<P>
   However, it seems that, of all places, the phone company should
be reachable by phone.
</P>
<P>
   I go through the options and there is nothing for someone
wishing to report an unwanted phone.
</P>
<P>
   No recording is saying, ``Press 3 if you don't like what we sent
you.''
</P>
<P>
   I keep punching buttons until I get the one for customer service
but that sinks me even deeper in the land of the well-modulated
voice offering options but no people.
</P>
<P>
   I finally choose the one that tells rotary phone callers to stay
on the line. I imagine that they provide this service for the three
people in the country who really do have phones that must be
cranked and who will be directed to a clunky old switchboard in
Iowa staffed by someone in a print dress and rolled hair practicing
her Lily Tomlin ``one ringy dingy'' imitation.
</P>
<P>
   I get her. She's real and I'm grateful. I tell her my troubles
and she says she'd like to help but I need to talk to someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it has to be a real person,'' I plead. ``Don't send me
back to voice mail.''
</P>
<P>
   She promises she is transferring me to someone who talks.
</P>
<P>
   The line is busy. I imagine Lily bent over laughing. I don't
want to hang up because it will cut my only living link with the
phone company.
</P>
<P>
   The line goes dead.
</P>
<P>
   I wait until the next day and start over and I never penetrate
the wall. By the third day I get a breathing human being. She says
she'll take the customer ID charge off my account, although it will
take a couple of billing cycles. She has no idea how it happened.
</P>
<P>
   What about the phone? Will they come and get it? She pauses as
if she's thinking and then says, ``Keep it.''
</P>
<P>
   Keep the phone I didn't order? Was she testing my integrity? If
I nab the phone will that suggest a larcenous nature that might
also fib about not wanting Caller ID?
</P>
<P>
   It's a hassle to send it back, she says. Surely, I could use a
new phone.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I could and replaced the kitchen phone, which has been
there so long the numbers were rubbed off the buttons.
</P>
<P>
   My new phone rang the next night and guess who? It was a
customer service rep from the phone company. I figured someone
snitched and I was about to confess to having a hot phone when he
said he didn't care about my telephones. He wanted to sign me up
for DSL service.

   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ More than 10 years ago I test
drove a 12-cylinder BMW that cost more than my house. One of the
features packed into this luxury high-performance car was a
hands-free telephone. The phone wasn't hooked up, but I was told
that the voices of the driver and passengers were picked up clearly
by a built-in microphone. The person on the other end of the
conversation was heard through the car's excellent speaker system,
which automatically muted other signals going to the speakers when
the phone was in use. I considered this a nifty development. Now I
own a hands-free telephone that doesn't require the purchase of a
$150,000 car. It's a cell phone. Unfortunately, America is turning
into a nation of Nervous Nellies determined to have the government
protect them from all risks. Chronically nervous Americans have
targeted cell phone use for government regulation, oversight and
criminalization. (Rowland Nethaway is senior editor of the Waco

trash at the annual Marshall clean-up isn't a problem for me. I
guess you could say I've been nothing but a muckraker all my life.
My first real job was picking up trash off the parking lot of a
foundry that employed about 500 people. It seemed like a good deal
to me, I got paid $40 a week to keep it clean no matter how many
hours I worked. If I could keep it clean by working two hours a
week, that was a cool 20 bucks an hour. (Latham, Marshall News

   MINTER-COLUMN _ FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ ATLANTA _ The notion that
some things never change has gone out the window in the 21st
century. Everything changes. If you don't believe it, look what's
happening in the Army, the Navy, the Air Force and even in the
Marines. According to a story in USA Today, basic training has gone
to what amounts to social promotions in public schools. Everybody
graduates. The new Army is bending over backward to help sad-sack
trainees. Instead of being thrown to the mercy of tough old
sergeants, recruits who arrive too soft and flabby for regular
training get an easier course. The nervous and fearful get
counseling to calm them down. (Jim Minter is a former editor of The

   ``The people who are in charge of explaining American politics

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _Following a consistent 52-year pattern, the
Palestinians have managed again to make the least of an

   BORDERS-COLUMN _ At least it's easy to come up with an excuse

climate of 90 degrees with a bit of shade and some air stirring
seems fairly tolerable after a full day of 103-degree weather in

   MCNEELY-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Chase Untermeyer of Houston, a

Bush, thinks Dick Cheney will be a great running mate. Cheney was
chief of staff for President Gerald Ford when Bush headed the
Central Intelligence Agency. Brent Scowcroft was national security

   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ More than 10 years ago I test
drove a 12-cylinder BMW that cost more than my house. One of the
features packed into this luxury high-performance car was a
hands-free telephone. The phone wasn't hooked up, but I was told
that the voices of the driver and passengers were picked up clearly
by a built-in microphone. The person on the other end of the
conversation was heard through the car's excellent speaker system,
which automatically muted other signals going to the speakers when
the phone was in use. I considered this a nifty development. Now I
own a hands-free telephone that doesn't require the purchase of a
$150,000 car. It's a cell phone. Unfortunately, America is turning
into a nation of Nervous Nellies determined to have the government
protect them from all risks. Chronically nervous Americans have
targeted cell phone use for government regulation, oversight and
criminalization. (Rowland Nethaway is senior editor of the Waco
Tribune-Herald) MOVED.LATHAM-COLUMN _ MARSHALL, Texas _ Picking up
trash at the annual Marshall clean-up isn't a problem for me. I
guess you could say I've been nothing but a muckraker all my life.
My first real job was picking up trash off the parking lot of a
foundry that employed about 500 people. It seemed like a good deal
to me, I got paid $40 a week to keep it clean no matter how many
hours I worked. If I could keep it clean by working two hours a
week, that was a cool 20 bucks an hour. (Latham, Marshall News
Messenger) MOVED.

<P>
   MINTER-COLUMN _ FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ ATLANTA _ The notion that
some things never change has gone out the window in the 21st
century. Everything changes. If you don't believe it, look what's
happening in the Army, the Navy, the Air Force and even in the
Marines. According to a story in USA Today, basic training has gone
to what amounts to social promotions in public schools. Everybody
graduates. The new Army is bending over backward to help sad-sack
trainees. Instead of being thrown to the mercy of tough old
sergeants, recruits who arrive too soft and flabby for regular
training get an easier course. The nervous and fearful get
counseling to calm them down. (Jim Minter is a former editor of The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

   ATTENTION EDITORIAL, OP-ED AND POLITICAL EDITORS
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who are in charge of explaining American politics
to the American people don't understand American politics. They
think it's largely about imagery, but it's really about reality.
The national conventions are the occasions when the swing voters
finally pause to take note of the real national circumstances that
will determine their votes.'' This excerpt is from Dayton Daily
News editorial writer Martin Gottlieb's new e-book _ ``Campaigns
Don't Count: How the Media Get American Politics All Wrong.'' The
book, which is available free in its entirety at
www.coxnews.com/2000, is the topic of a full page layout that will
run on Sunday, July 30 in the Daily News. The page will be
available Wednesday, July 26 after 5 p.m. EDT with an embargo until

   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ A reader wrote that he was told a billion
means a thousand million in the United States but that in the
United Kingdom, it means a million million. Yes, a newspaper
confirmed, there is a difference _ a difference that totals 999
thousand million, which is a helluva more ones and ones than ever I
could count. (Kleinberg, Cox News Service.) MOVED THURSDAY.
</P>
<P>
   GLASS-COLUMN _ The mobile phone scene has changed since 1984,
when an attorney friend told me that he would be getting a car
phone in return for having done legal work for a pioneering telecom
provider. In time, he passed up that swap. But I bought a phone, to
the surprise of dinner hosts who directed us into their unmarked
cul-de-sacs. (Andy Glass is a columnist for Cox News Service in the

   HUNLEY _ For most of the 136 years since it became an icon of
naval history, the Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley has been
buried in the soft mud at the bottom of Charleston Harbor _ lost,
then found, but always surprisingly safe from the ravages of time.
All that will change next month when a giant crane lifts the
Hunley, encrusted with marine growth, from its watery grave into
the sunlight of a Carolina summer. For Civil War and submarine
buffs the world over, raising the Hunley will mark the realization
of a dream. For archaeologists, it is the start of a race against
time _ one that will ultimately determine how many secrets locked
inside in the 40-foot submarine are uncovered. ``The minute the
Hunley reaches the surfaces, we will have a ticking time bomb on
our hands,'' says'' says Maria Jacobsen, the archaeologist who will
direct the excavation of the submarine in a state-of-the-art
laboratory at the old Charleston Navy Yard. (Toner, Atlanta

   HUNLEY _ For most of the 136 years since it became an icon of
naval history, the Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley has been
buried in the soft mud at the bottom of Charleston Harbor _ lost,
then found, but always surprisingly safe from the ravages of time.
All that will change next month when a giant crane lifts the
Hunley, encrusted with marine growth, from its watery grave into
the sunlight of a Carolina summer. For Civil War and submarine
buffs the world over, raising the Hunley will mark the realization
of a dream. For archaeologists, it is the start of a race against
time _ one that will ultimately determine how many secrets locked
inside in the 40-foot submarine are uncovered. ``The minute the
Hunley reaches the surfaces, we will have a ticking time bomb on
our hands,'' says'' says Maria Jacobsen, the archaeologist who will
direct the excavation of the submarine in a state-of-the-art
laboratory at the old Charleston Navy Yard. (Toner, Atlanta

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: East Texas women
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ East Texas women, love 'em or leave 'em alone.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a couple of stories, as true as anything you'll read in
today's paper:
</P>
<P>
   Story No. 1
</P>
<P>
   A prospective jury panel had been called for a criminal case
involving a shooting that had resulted from a child custody
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   One of the defense attorneys, questioning the panel as a group,
asked for a show of hands of anyone who had been divorced. A number
of hands went up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who suffered a particularly ugly divorce?'' he then
asked.
</P>
<P>
   A well-dressed, grandmotherly-like lady in the fourth row raised
her hand immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``And this was, of course, a very difficult time for you,'' the
attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   The lady nodded, her face sad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever fear for your life?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Again she nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``And has this carried over into your present life?'' the
attorney asked in a most sympathetic voice. ``Do you still have
reason to be fearful?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no,'' she said, rather brightly. ``He's dead now.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a brief pause as every eye in the courtroom turned
toward her.
</P>
<P>
   She quickly added, in a reassuring manner:
</P>
<P>
   ``But I didn't kill him.''
</P>
<P>
   Story No. 2:
</P>
<P>
   A lady, who by all appearances was a very proper lady, had
stopped at a discount store with her husband to pick up a number of
items.
</P>
<P>
   When they reached the check-out line, there was a number of
people ahead of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to the car and start the air-conditioning,'' the
husband said, which at best was a lame excuse for not wanting to
stand in line.
</P>
<P>
   As he headed out the door, a woman next to the lady snorted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't that just like a man,'' she said, shaking her head with
disgust.
</P>
<P>
   This woman, wearing short shorts and a crop top, looked anything
but a lady. Her hair was a brassy yellow, and her skin, the victim
of entirely too much sun, had begun to take on the appearance of
tooled leather.
</P>
<P>
   Her voice was somewhat brassy as well, with a harsh, husky edge
that indicated there was most likely a crushed pack of king-size,
menthol cigarettes inside her large, satchel-like purse, a
purported designer-series of questionable authenticity,
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' she sniffed, ``my husband's the very same way. I spend
most of the day working in the yard in the hot sun while he sits at
his computer in the air-conditioning.''
</P>
<P>
   The lady, nodding and smiling and _ as always _ being the
pleasant kind of person that a lady is, tried to offer a bit of
encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, yard work can be quite rewarding,'' she said, ever
so sweetly.
</P>
<P>
   The woman looked at her a long moment, sighed deeply and shook
her head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honey,'' she said, smiling a sad smile, ``I'm talking about
the wrecking yard.''
</P>
<P>
   East Texas women, you can't help but love 'em.

of having left this mortal plane, but certainly in the notion that
their time in the spotlight has passed. (Simmons, Dayton Daily

<P>
   Rick Lazio, the Republican candidate for Senate in New York, is
post-everything. Born in 1958, he came along too late to be
influenced by the civil rights struggle, the Vietnam War, the '60s,
Watergate. The first presidential campaign Lazio volunteered to
work on was Gerald Ford's in 1976. This is not just a matter of
historical curiosity. Our political life is dominated by figures
who came of age in the '60s and whose views bear the mark of these
great events, just as the outlook of preceding generations was
shaped by the Cold War, World War II and the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   Think of Hillary Clinton, Lazio's opponent, who was born into a
Midwestern Republican family and whose complacent sense of the
order of things was upended by the liberal social gospel of her
Methodist church. Even Gov. George Pataki, a genial Republican who
is an ally of Lazio's _ and with whom Lazio is often compared _
became a Goldwater conservative in the '60s. Large, polarizing
events force choices, and those choices create a certain crispness
in point of view.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Lazio is genuinely suspicious of crispness. ``Rick is not
just 50-50 on the issues,'' says Peter King, a fellow member of New
York's Republican delegation in Congress. ``Within those issues he
tends to take the middle position.'' King, a conservative, takes a
rather dim view of Lazio's difference-splitting politics; Lazio
himself says that his moderate moderateness makes him an effective
legislator as well as an appealing candidate.
</P>
<P>
   On a hot Saturday morning in June, Lazio delivered the
commencement address at West Islip High School, a big two-story tan
brick structure that looks like every high school built in the
1950s. Lazio is West Islip, class of 1976 _ the school's most
famous graduate. The crowd was almost all white; about half the
graduates were Italian-American. Lazio's manner was artlessly
modest. He talked about his happy boyhood going to the beach with
his pals, and eating at the Long River Chinese Restaurant, and
clamming in the Great South Bay. (Clamming in the bay has become
Lazio shorthand both for ``authentic New Yorker'' and for
``environmentally conscious.'')
</P>
<P>
   He worked a few variations on the theme ``dare to dream.'' He
told the kids how much their parents loved them. And he closed with
a dazzling array of aphorisms: ``Treat others as you would like to
be treated. ... Honesty, loyalty and trust combine to make an
honorable life. ... Be a good child to your parents, and a good
parent to your children.'' The speech sounded as if it had been
stitched on samplers.
</P>
<P>
   I got to talking afterward with a silver-blond woman sitting
behind me. Her name was Donna Brogan, and it turned out that she
had been Lazio's classmate. The conversation went like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember anything particularly noteworthy about him?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really. He was just a nice, average guy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Smart?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, maybe a little smarter than usual.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything else come to mind?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really. He was just a nice, average guy from a nice,
average town.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a clarion call for the voters of New York: vote for Rick
Lazio, the candidate from ``Pleasantville.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Lazio comes from the dead center of Long Island. He
grew up in a home-owning, small-business world. His father, Tony,
owned a small auto-parts store, and the family _ Rick and three
older sisters _ lived in a modest Cape Cod a few blocks from the
water. Rick was just another kid biking around town, collecting
baseball cards, shooting hoops in the driveway.
</P>
<P>
   But politics, in a quotidian sense, had always been part of
Lazio's life. His father was a gregarious character, a joiner, and
he was a figure in local Republican circles. His father's wasn't
conservative Republicanism or plutocratic Republicanism or
Rockefeller Republicanism; it was, if anything, small-town, Fourth
of July Republicanism. ``I wouldn't say it was real doctrine at
all,'' says Lazio. ``It was more like rooting for a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, any search for doctrine is in vain. When I asked Lazio
about the origin of his political views, he said, ``I think the
most dominant beliefs for me are the beliefs that were transferred
to me growing up _ the sense of family, watching out for others, of
work, of not expecting to get something for nothing but expecting
that there will be a sense of responsibility that comes with
opportunities.'' Hillary Clinton had pretty much the same values
transferred to her, but values this consensual dictate nothing
about political views _ and preclude nothing, which is perhaps
their virtue in Lazio's mind. Lazio can not only work with anyone,
he can also potentially side with anyone. He does not, he says
emphatically, have a ``rigid ideology.''
</P>
<P>
   After attending Vassar, Lazio enrolled at American University
law school in Washington, and when he graduated he returned to West
Islip. His father was confined to a wheelchair after a stroke, and
Lazio felt that he was needed at home. He took a job as an
assistant district attorney and dabbled in local politics on the
side. In 1989, soon after he left the DA's office, John Cochrane,
the county Republican leader, asked Lazio to run for a seat in the
County Legislature. Lazio agreed to run, and beat the Democratic
incumbent. That same year, he married Patricia Moriarity, a nurse
and the sister of a law school buddy.
</P>
<P>
   He was a conscientious legislator, along with being handsome and
genial, and it quickly became clear that he was destined for larger
things. Here, for the first time, Lazio demonstrated an instinct
for the main chance. ``He was a cut above the typical county
legislator,'' says Patrick Halpin, a Democrat who was serving as
county executive when Lazio took office. ``However, he was not one
to embrace or advocate a cause. I frankly can't recall a situation
where he used any of his political capital to advance a cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's first and only truly extraordinary achievement in
politics was his 1992 defeat of Rep. Thomas Downey, a Democrat and
18-year incumbent whose seat appeared unassailable. Lazio declared
in early 1992 and was promptly embraced by the party as an
unusually worthy sacrificial lamb.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the spring of 1992, the House banking scandal hit, and
Downey was found to have bounced 151 checks. ABC News showed Downey
on a Jet Ski at an insurance-industry junket. A private poll showed
that Lazio went from 25 points down to 25 points up once voters
knew about these peccadilloes. Lazio made the scandal the issue,
tearing into his immensely better-financed and better-connected
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has been a tremendous relief for Republican leaders who
had grown increasingly fretful about Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's
rather sullen noncampaign campaign. Lazio is as loyal a party man
as Giuliani was solitary and refractory. Last summer, when Lazio
and Giuliani were both jockeying for position, Pataki barely made a
secret of his dislike for the mayor _ and his fondness for the
youngster from Suffolk.
</P>
<P>
   But Lazio obediently dropped out of the race last summer when
Pataki felt that he had to support Giuliani. When Lazio jumped back
in after Giuliani, beset with prostate cancer and a girlfriend,
announced two months ago that he would not run for the Senate,
Pataki immediately made it clear that he was in Lazio's camp. Other
potential challengers, including Peter King, never had a chance.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Lazio entered the race, Hillary Clinton's campaign
was finally looking like a well-oiled, if not terribly effective,
machine. Lazio had to create a campaign staff, a campaign
headquarters, a message and a schedule on the fly _ and all while
continuing to show up in Congress. Week by week, the campaign has
been getting less impromptu and more professional. Lazio hired as
his media adviser and chief strategist Mike Murphy, who engineered
John McCain's presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio already had $3.5 million in the bank when he jumped into
the race, and he has since raised another $4.5 million. (Raising
money to run against Hillary Clinton is not exactly uphill work.)
And he very quickly pulled even with Clinton in the polls, in spite
of the fact that few voters had any clear idea what he stood for or
even who he was. A recent poll showed the candidates tied; 40
percent of voters viewed Clinton negatively, while only 13 percent
viewed Lazio negatively.
</P>
<P>
   Under attack recently for allegedly turning a $16,000 profit by
trading on inside information _ the SEC is now conducting an
investigation _ Lazio looked into the camera and declared, ``All I
can say is I'm an average, middle-class guy.'' He had, he said,
talked to Pat, and she had said: ``You know what? We're honest,
decent people. I clean my own house.''
</P>
<P>
   When he travels these days with Pat and their two daughters,
Molly, 8, and Kelsey, 7, which he does as often as possible, Lazio
presents a family-values tableau that Clinton cannot match. The
Lazios project the air of unfeigned happiness that the Clintons
themselves never quite managed even in their best days.
</P>
<P>
   But pleasant though he is, Lazio has not hesitated to run a
``difficult'' campaign against Clinton. He links her name to the
word ``mud'' as often as possible. And he recently responded to an
ancient and dubiously founded tale of an anti-Semitic remark by
Clinton by saying, ``I don't know who to believe.'' Lazio is
plainly hoping that the election will ultimately be a referendum on
Hillary Clinton. Given his low profile and her consistent high
negatives in the polls, this is not an unreasonable expectation.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio arrived in Congress in 1993, before there was a Republican
majority in the House. He quickly came to be identified with the
group of moderate Republicans from the Northeast who found a lot to
like in President Clinton's New Democratic agenda. He was one of
only 40 Republicans who voted for the Family and Medical Leave Act
in 1993, and the following year he voted with the president 72
percent of the time, which placed him third in that category among
House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's world was transformed by the election of 1994, which
vaulted the Republicans to majority status in both houses. In 1995
Lazio voted with the president only 34 percent of the time, which
represents the largest swing of any of the moderates. I asked Lazio
if he had come to see the merits of the ``opportunity society''
conservatism that Jack Kemp, Newt Gingrich and others were
championing at the time _ a dynamic species of Republicanism he had
never encountered in Suffolk County. Lazio probably regarded this
as a trick question. ``I don't think so,'' he said carefully. He
added that he eschews ``harsh partisanship'' and judges each bill
on its merits. An alternative view is that Lazio recognized that he
could advance within the new leadership by being the kind of
moderate whom conservatives could work with.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio was eager for advancement; but unlike most ambitious
people, he had the kind of anodyne personality that muted conflict.
He was an insider and a team player. Lazio says that his own
natural tendency is ``to build communication among people with
diverse views and to try to get people to reason together.'' One
person who has worked closely with Lazio says more pointedly,
``He's not about to irritate people with a gratuitous press
conference or even an off-the-record comment about another
member.'' Lazio was a bridge waiting to be used.
</P>
<P>
   Good things began happening to him as soon as the new leadership
took over. Tom DeLay, the new whip, made Lazio a deputy whip
responsible for counting heads in the moderate group. As a
freshman, Lazio was given a seat on the prestigious Banking
Committee, and in 1995 he became chairman of the Housing
Subcommittee; in 1997, Speaker Gingrich granted Lazio's request to
keep his position while he also joined the Commerce Committee,
despite party rules that limit members to one of those assignments.
And the following year, after he rallied to the side of the
embattled majority leader, Dick Armey, Armey made Lazio a deputy
majority leader, thus making him the one avowed moderate in the
inner circle of leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The Northeastern moderates, known as ``the Lunch Bunch,'' had a
representative in leadership meetings; Lazio was not only the first
of these ambassadors, he was also asked to remain after his term
had ended. The moderates say that Lazio's gift for getting along
with absolutely everyone, unto the veriest bomb-thrower, served
their cause well.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has served in Congress during a time of almost
unprecedented turbulence inside the Republican Party. The party
tore itself apart over the consequences of the 1995 government
shutdown and the impeachment of Clinton; Gingrich was ultimately
deposed, and Armey came close. The moderates and the leadership
have been at war, and yet Lazio has never lost his bona fides with
either side. This is a sign either of extraordinary political
deftness or of an unwillingness to stand up and be counted.
</P>
<P>
   Even Lazio's supporters say that he rarely engages in debate,
and Peter King, the combative Nassau County Republican, observes:
``Rick's natural instinct is to not create tension or to not
exacerbate tension. On the one hand, you could say that he's a
conciliator. On the other side, you could say that he shies away
from confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when I asked Christopher Shays, a moderate from
Connecticut and a big Lazio booster, to tell me about a time Lazio
had put himself on the line, he was stumped. ``I'll get back to
you,'' he said. But he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Like almost all Republicans, Lazio voted for most of the
articles in Gingrich's Contract With America (eight out of 10) and
voted for the GOP budget bills that ultimately led to the
government shutdown. But he did not join the increasingly noisy
revolt against the leadership after the fiasco of the 1996
election.
</P>
<P>
   Both Peter King and Michael Forbes, who represents the eastern
tip of Long Island, publicly criticized Gingrich and were
thoroughly marginalized as a consequence, Forbes so much so that he
ultimately switched to the Democratic Party. Lazio supported
Gingrich to the end, enhancing his influence and preserving his
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes now speaks very bitterly about Lazio. ``Rick has been on
a singular track to advance himself,'' he says. ``We're all
ambitious, but there's a certain code you're trying to follow. The
guy does have this almost unethical approach to things.''
</P>
<P>
   One cannot, of course, easily draw the line between a prudent
circumspection and unprincipled opportunism. On the impeachment
issue, for example, Lazio charted his usual tortuous course. For
many months he took the position, favored by many Democrats and
some Republicans, that the president deserved censure rather than
impeachment. Then, a few days before the vote, when DeLay had begun
ratcheting up the pressure on the undecided, Lazio called a news
conference to announce that he would vote for two of the four
impeachment counts, thus allowing him to be on both sides of the
most contentious issue of his political career.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's voting record has remained generally moderate and
includes many votes against leadership. He voted for the Brady law,
which mandated a five-day waiting period for handgun purchases; he
is generally considered a friend to the environmental movement; he
has voted for full financing for the National Endowment for the
Arts (though he has also voted at other times to sharply cut arts
financing); he favors campaign-finance reform; he opposes ending
affirmative action in higher education.
</P>
<P>
   But Lazio has also voted for deep cuts in social programs, to
eliminate the Department of Education, for a ban on homosexuals in
the military. Many of his fellow moderates cast the same votes;
what is intriguing about Lazio's record is a pattern of voting with
the leadership and against virtually the entire body of moderates,
especially on the symbolic and social issues that most of the
moderates find embarrassing, but that conservatives like Armey and
DeLay take so seriously.
</P>
<P>
   A striking example, which his opponent has already begun to harp
on, is abortion. Lazio considers himself in favor of abortion
rights, as he told Jane O'Hea. At the same time, he regularly votes
for restrictions on access to abortion and opposes the use of
Medicaid to pay for abortions. This is not an uncommon position,
but Lazio has also voted for anti-abortion measures that virtually
all pro-abortion-rights legislators in both parties opposed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, for example, he voted in favor of the Unborn Victims of
Violence Act, a personal favorite of Dick Armey's, which would have
made it a separate offense to harm or kill a child in utero, even
if the perpetrator had no idea that the women in question was
pregnant. If the fetus _ ``in any stage of development'' _ died,
the accused would be charged with murder, which is to say that the
unborn child's life status would be equal to the mother's even if
it was only moments after conception.
</P>
<P>
   It may be possible to reconcile a vote for such a bill while
remaining in favor of abortion rights, but it's not easy to imagine
how, so I recently asked Lazio to explain to me his general views
on abortion. It's not in Lazio's nature to have general views on
something, and the subject plainly made him uncomfortable; as he
spoke he kept trailing off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what's really important about the issue is to try to
come at it with a sense of respect for people who have passionate
views on both sides,'' he said. ``I don't make either camp happy
all the time, I don't make either camp unhappy all the time, just
because I'm looking at this issue and trying to find the most
reasonable outcome for me.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about the Unborn Victims of Violence Act?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's what it said at all,'' Lazio said, when I
explained the language of the bill. In a later discussion I read
him the exact language, and Lazio said that ``many people who are
pro-choice support the idea that there is status to the fetus.'' He
also pointed out that the legislation did not criminalize abortion
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Piscitelli, spokeswoman for the National Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action League, argues that Lazio is ``doing the
minimum so that he can say to the sizable pro-choice majority in
New York, 'Hey, I'm in favor of choice,' but then he's not really
being there when he's needed, not really being pro-choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Forbes, who is himself unabashedly anti-abortion, says,
``Rick Lazio is no pro-life person; that's just Rick Lazio in
pursuit of the Conservative Party line.'' Or perhaps, since Lazio
could have satisfied the Conservatives simply by voting against
``partial birth'' abortion, it was Lazio currying favor with Armey
and his army.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has been thinking about the Senate race since November
1998, when Chuck Schumer toppled Alfonse D'Amato. ``We talked about
it the night Al D'Amato lost,'' says one of Lazio's advisers.
</P>
<P>
   One of Lazio's great problems will be convincing voters that he
is grown-up enough to be a senator: New Yorkers do not want to feel
that they're replacing Daniel Patrick Moynihan with Beaver Cleaver.
And Lazio cannot afford to dissipate his family-values advantage,
which might well happen should the SEC investigation of his trading
patterns turn up anything untoward.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Lazio may succeed in parrying Hillary Clinton's
ideological thrusts and still be left with questions about his
character. But voters tend to reserve the word ``character'' to
describe how a candidate behaves at moments of difficulty. It's not
enough, and perhaps not even necessary, for the people we elect to
be good children to their parents and good parents to their
children. They have to make hard choices; and Lazio, the man who
admires Dick Armey, may still have something to prove in that
regard.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps he doesn't. If voters no longer feel that they're
entrusting large choices to politicians _ and perhaps they don't _
then character may well be a thing of the past, too.

 (ART ADV: Photos of genetically altered mice are available on
Newscom or by calling William Gonzalez at 212-499-3355.) 
 By LAWRENCE OSBORNE  
 c.2000 Lawrence Osborne  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Inside a claustrophobic plastic laboratory container, two
brown-coated mice are poring over a new litter of grublike pups. A
lab technician dips a pair of forceps into a tub of disinfectant
and then grabs one by the tail. It is Papa, and he begins squeaking
and wriggling as he is hoisted from the container. ``He's the
normal one,'' says Muriel Davisson, a prominent mouse genetics
researcher. ``It's the female who's the mutant. Now look at her.''
</P>
<P>
   The mother indeed looks unusual. Perpetually off balance, she
stumbles around her tiny offspring. Her coat is tatty, striated by
pale lines, and her face is distinctly lopsided. Her mousy gaze
looks cross-eyed; she is also noticeably puny. I scan the
identification tag on the container: TS65DN.
</P>
<P>
   '``DN' stands for Down syndrome,'' Davisson says quietly over my
shoulder. ``We're mating her with a normal mouse to see how Down
genes get passed on to offspring. Have you ever seen a mouse with
Down syndrome?''
</P>
<P>
   I have to admit that I have not.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not surprising,'' Davisson says. ``They're extremely
rare in the wild. They get eaten in two seconds. But here, they get
to live and have pups _ Down syndrome pups.''
</P>
<P>
   We pick up the Down mother and examine her twitching, compressed
face. ``She's only a year old,'' says Joiel Davies, a research
assistant. ``But she already looks like an old lady.''
</P>
<P>
   What about the pups? Davisson points her forceps at two of them.
``As you can see,'' she goes on, ``these two likely have Down as
well. They're beginning to twitch. Down, of course, is an entirely
genetic disease. That's why these mice are so crucial to us.''
</P>
<P>
   In humans, Down arises as a result of a duplication of
chromosome 21. In mice, it is chromosome 16 that gets doubled. The
proteins in human chromosome 21 and mouse chromosome 16 are very
similar but not identical. Thus, the mice have a disorder something
like Down, if not corresponding exactly to it. ``It's not 100
percent,'' Davisson admits. ``But it's close enough. It's mouse
Down.''
</P>
<P>
   We are standing in one of the 47 ``mouse rooms'' of the Jackson
Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine, one of the world's foremost
facilities for breeding and studying mice. This room alone holds
34,000 animals. The mice are stored in racks of clear plastic
containers, each one fitted with an exhaust pipe that connects to
the ceiling and siphons off used air. Each unit is equipped with
pine shavings, pellets and a water bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the transparent boxes sit every variety of mouse
imaginable: albino mice, black mice, bald mice, piebald mice, fat
mice, thin mice, bored mice, epileptic mice. There are more
varieties of mice here than in any natural ecosystem, and each one
has a specific scientific use. For the Jackson rodents are
unwitting actors in cutting-edge research into the relationship
between genetics and human disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``JAX mice,'' as the Jackson mice are known to scientists, are
bred or tailored to carry diseases that mirror those of humans.
Through either crossbreeding or genetic engineering _ that is, by
adding or ``knocking out'' specific genes _ Jackson scientists
produce ``transgenic model mice.'' These rodents have been
programmed from birth to develop tumors, inherit glaucoma or
reproduce milder pathologies, like obesity.
</P>
<P>
   The genetically engineered mouse strains have become the hottest
items on most labs' shopping lists. In fact, although the use of
animals as lab subjects had been declining in recent decades, the
boom in transgenic mice has reversed that trend. The rise is wholly
attributable to genetics research. Cheaper to breed than primates
yet genetically similar to humans, mice are playing a key role in
the development of gene therapies _ and figure centrally in
research aiming to pinpoint the genetic basis of human disease.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, so valued is the mouse that it is the only other mammal
whose full genetic code is being parsed by the National Institutes
of Health and Celera Genomics, the team that recently completed the
Human Genome Project. (The mouse sequence is expected by December.)
Referred to as ``fuzzy test tubes'' by scientists, mice are now
worth their weight in gold. ``The mouse,'' the journal Science
recently trumpeted, ``is taking over in the lab as a model of human
genetics.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jackson Laboratory is the world's most diverse ``mouse
ranch.'' It maintains 2,500 strains of mice for sale, of which 33
are produced in large quantities. (Conveniently, mice reproduce
once every three months.) Twenty-five million mice are bred every
year for lab research _ twice as many as in 1990. ``The
mouse-wrangling business is booming,'' says Luther Young, a Jackson
official, using another term from the horse trade. Although
Jackson, which had $59 million in revenues last year, is a
nonprofit institution, the overall mouse industry is a $200 million
affair.
</P>
<P>
   The mouse industry's astonishing growth has been accompanied by
controversy. For rather arbitrary reasons, the Department of
Agriculture has long exempted mice from the provisions of the 1966
Animal Welfare Act, which established standards of care for lab
animals. This loophole, critics say, has made it possible for
scientists to manipulate mice in vast numbers, cruelly or
otherwise. Curiously, the act contains a category known as Other
Animals, which includes ferrets, armadillos, spotted hyenas,
chinchillas and woodchucks, but not the common mouse. The USDA's
lab-animal census therefore counts only 1.2 million animals in
American institutions, whereas the real total is probably closer to
50 million. And almost all of them are mice.
</P>
<P>
   Today's frenzied market for mice _ thousands of varieties, with
prices that can't be beat! _ might well change as a result of a
lawsuit brought by animal rights groups determined to bring mice
under the umbrella of the 1966 law. Last month, the U.S. District
Court in Washington ruled for the Alternatives Research and
Development Foundation in its suit against the Department of
Agriculture. If the government does not file an appeal, the cost of
caring for mice could skyrocket by 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Such a development could put the brakes on the mouse industry.
Some critics would welcome just that. John McArdle, director of the
group that brought the lawsuit, says: ``I'm sure Jackson has high
standards, but it's the scale of the thing that creeps me out.
Overall, the mouse industry is a lucrative fad, driven by money and
by corporate greed.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Bult, a scientist at Jackson who specializes in turning
genetic research into databases, disagrees. Experiments on mutant
mice, she argues, ``will yield an immense number of gene targets
for pharmaceutical companies.'' Indeed, criticism of the
mouse-wrangling industry profoundly irritates most scientists,
including Davisson. ``Our mice may be bored,'' she says, rolling
her eyes, ``but mistreated? Look around you.''
</P>
<P>
   The room is indeed spotlessly clean and calm. There is barely a
sound from the 34,000 inmates _ a solitary squeak here and there.
(The room gets noisy at night, I'm told, when the lights are shut
off and the nocturnal creatures perk up.)
</P>
<P>
   We dip into the next plastic container. Inside are two albino
mice with fragile pink eyes. As soon as the roof of their little
world is lifted they begin jerking their heads upward, tilting
their ears from side to side and sniffing. Davisson explains that
these strains have an inborn defect of the inner ear that
unbalances them and causes them to cock their heads skyward
continually. The researchers, rather poetically, call them
Stargazers.
</P>
<P>
   A few containers down, another white specimen scoots around his
pine shavings in a relentless figure-eight pattern. He is known as
a Waltzer. Below him, a black mouse bangs his head against the
plastic repetitively. This is a Punk Rocker. And there are more,
usually bearing names that express their genetic dysfunction:
Fidget, Fat, Shiver and so on.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, people have bred mutant mice. The ancient Cretans
admired albinos and occasionally had them nest in their temples.
Waltzers were cherished by the ancient Chinese. In the West,
eccentric ``mouse fanciers'' began keeping mutants as pets in the
19th century. These hobbyists caught the attention of scientists,
who wondered if they might have more serious uses. In 1909, a young
Harvard researcher named Clarence Cook Little started up his own
mouse colony. Fascinated by inherited mutations among rodents, he
became convinced that they might offer a way to understand a
genetic basis for cancer in humans.
</P>
<P>
   That year, Little developed the first inbred mouse strain by
mating brothers and sisters. These inbreds did not have the
mixed-colored pelts of wild mice; their consistently brown pelts
betrayed their artificiality. In 1921, scientists used some of
Little's mice to create a tumor-prone creature called the ``A
strain.'' The era of the laboratory mouse was well under way.
</P>
<P>
   In 1929, Little founded the Jackson Laboratory. Cancer became
the ranch's principal focus. In an early experiment, females that
were highly susceptible to mammary tumors were crossbred with
healthy strains to trace the tumor inheritance in the offspring. At
the same time as it began pioneering the genetics of cancer,
Jackson also began selling mice. By 1945, about 9,000 Swiss white
mice were being shipped out every week at 20 cents apiece. Last
year, Jackson shipped 1.7 million mice to 12,000 labs worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   As I walk through the lab's sunny upstairs corridors, where a
mouse is never seen except on a poster, I'm surprised at how airy
and optimistically healthy it feels. The wood-finished walls are
covered with cute prints of mice in idyllic settings. There is an
adorable Mus musculus crawling ecstatically over a chunk of Gouda
instead of languishing inside a Tupperware-like box. There is a
Meriones americanus, or jumping mouse, frolicking among stalks of
maize. Another poster shows a small girl in a hospital bed holding
a teddybear. ``It's the animals you don't see,'' it says, ``that
really helped her recover.''
</P>
<P>
   In the library, I meet Ken Paigen, Jackson's director. Here
there are glass sculptures of mice as well as Hopi kachina dolls of
mice and a bizarre print showing quill-wielding mice laboring over
Japanese calligraphy. It's a veritable shrine. ``Lovely, aren't
they?'' Paigen murmurs. ``They're fascinating animals, really.''
</P>
<P>
   Paigen is a former Berkeley genetics professor who came to Bar
Harbor in 1989. ``What we're doing here is mapping out the
underlying reasons why you and I get sick,'' he says. ``We're
investigating the genetic pathways of illness, unraveling the
mysteries of the gene.'' Every disease, he points out, has
susceptible and resistant strains. ``Why are there different
outcomes in different mice with the same disease? Because of their
genes. We're out to find these modifying genes.''
</P>
<P>
   Each human, Paigen explains, has up to 100,000 different
proteins in his or her body. Most current medicines target only
about 400 of them and work according to inadequately blunt
statistical averages. ``Imagine a medicine tailored to an
individual's precise genetic makeup,'' he says, eyes twinkling.
``We could invent a whole new medicine! It's definitely the
medicine of the 21st century. And the mouse is the key.''
</P>
<P>
   But why not the woodchuck or some higher mammal? For one thing,
mice have a long history in science; researchers know a great deal
about them. ``And then,'' he continues, ``they breed so quickly
that we can study three generations or more a year. That's vital
when you're studying inheritance.'' He pauses and twiddles his
thumbs. ``They're also extremely cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's 33 staff scientists work on everything from diabetes
to lupus. For some maladies, an appropriate model mouse already
exists in nature. (Blind mice, after all, aren't just found in
nursery rhymes.) But to create model mice for many human diseases,
healthy mice must be injected with potent drugs _ hormones,
viruses, antibiotics _ that cause novel mutations. Such trickery is
growing ever more sophisticated. ``Nowadays, we can even transfer
genes across species,'' Paigen says.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Knowles, associate director of the lab, breeds cancerous
tumors in her Black 6 mice. (``A nice, docile mouse,'' she says.
``Good breeder.'') To engineer her mutants, she injects embryos
with a lethal monkey virus, Simian Virus 40; it triggers cancerous
tumors almost identical to those in humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the verge of understanding how tumors arise,'' she
says. ``The thing is, these tumors will not grow in normal B6's. So
we know that the B6 has a genetic defense against them.'' By
planting the tumor into the B6, then breeding it with normal
members of its own strain, Knowles can observe how the propensity
to grow or not grow tumors is transmitted by genes: over 10 or so
generations, a revealing pattern of resistance and nonresistance
will emerge.
</P>
<P>
   ``A mouse reaches sexual maturity in six weeks,'' Knowles says
as she shows me gently around her lab. ``Obviously, that makes it
the ideal testing ground for genetic pathways.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, none of this radiant scientific serenity cuts much
ice with animal rights advocates. ``These are Frankenstein mice,
pure and simple,'' says Dean Smith of the American Anti-Vivisection
Society outside Philadelphia. ``These animals are being programmed
to die of cancer! It's horrendous. Basically, they're cheap and
there's no federal regulation covering them. You can do whatever
you want with them.'' Smith adamantly insists, moreover, that
computer simulations and models can replace animals one day.
``Besides,'' he adds, echoing a familiar refrain of animal rights
advocates, ``the health benefits of using mice are exaggerated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From my perspective, it's simple,'' Ken Paigen says. ``It's
mice or us, basically. All modern medicine is based on animal
experimentation. Computer models are definitely inadequate.''
</P>
<P>
   Harold Varmus, president of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center in New York, is also not impressed by the utopian
possibility of dispensing with lab mice. He admits, though, that
gene experimentation will not yield wonder medicines straight away.
``Is the mouse oversold?'' he says. ``Sometimes. But where's the
exact line between pure research and medicine development?
Actually, the whole trajectory of cancer research is now away from
cultures in the petri dish toward what happens inside the live
animal. Mouse and human genetics aren't a perfect match, but
they're close enough. It's a proven tool of huge value.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   What I remember most about entering Ronald Reagan's suite early
on the third evening of the 1980 Republican convention, the night
of his nomination, was the silence. It's not that there weren't
plenty of people around. William J. Casey, Reagan's campaign
manager, Richard Wirthlin, his pollster, and his advisers Peter
Hannaford, Michael Deaver and Edwin Meese were all there in the
candidate's elegantly appointed rooms on the 69th floor of the
Detroit Plaza Hotel. So, too, was Reagan, dressed in a casual shirt
and tan slacks. The entire group was seated on a large U-shaped
couch, hushed, as if they were watching some spellbinding movie on
TV.
</P>
<P>
   The silence in the room was in marked contrast to the steadily
rising noise at the Joe Louis Arena. There, word was spreading that
Reagan was going to choose Gerald Ford, the former president and
his bitter adversary in the 1976 primaries, to be his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   As Reagan's foreign policy adviser, I didn't have much business
getting involved in the selection of a vice president. But as
someone who signed on with Reagan because I admired his principled
criticism of the foreign policy of the Nixon, Ford and Carter
administrations, I couldn't help venturing to the suite to see what
was going on. And so, at 5:30 in the evening, before I was to head
over to the convention, I walked up the single flight of stairs
that separated Reagan's floor from mine. It didn't take long for my
suspicions to be confirmed. As I stepped into the hallway, there,
coming out of Reagan's rooms and flanked by his Secret Service
detail, was a tanned and fit Gerald Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Once the former president and I had exchanged pleasantries, I
made my way past security to Reagan's suite. Alone among those
gathered on the couch, the nominee looked up and greeted me. I
asked if he needed anything before I left for the arena. ``Oh,
no,'' he replied, ``but thanks.''
</P>
<P>
   As I turned to leave, he asked, ``What do you think of the Ford
deal?'' ``What deal?'' I responded, genuinely surprised that the
two parties were already working out details. In addition to the
vice-presidential slot, Reagan said, ``Ford wants Kissinger as
secretary of state and Greenspan at Treasury.'' My instant response
was, ``That is the craziest deal I have ever heard of.'' And it
was.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, both major presidential candidates have conducted
highly structured searches for their running mates. Richard Cheney,
the former secretary of defense, spent months vetting candidates
for George W. Bush before getting the nod himself. Former Secretary
of State Warren Christopher has been doing the same for Al Gore,
who has yet to name his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Though it was only 20 years ago, the process in 1980 could not
have been more different from the one today. It is hard to imagine
an unexpected vice-presidential pick at the last minute, like John
Kennedy's selection of Lyndon Johnson in 1960, Richard Nixon's
choice of Spiro Agnew in 1968 or even George Bush Sr.'s elevation
of Dan Quayle in 1988 _ all of which caught the candidates'
advisers by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Ronald Reagan's nomination of Governor Bush's father
that bears special telling. Reagan's selection of Bush in Detroit
represented a turnabout within six hours; it came only when the
negotiations with Ford, having taken on a life of their own,
appeared to have reached an impasse. Had the talks succeeded and
had Ford been selected, the Reagan campaign, crippled by
infighting, might well have lost to the Carter-Mondale ticket in
the fall. Had Reagan and Ford managed to win the election, it's
very likely that their administration would have been hobbled by an
unworkable power-sharing arrangement. It's also possible that the
Republicans might have a different candidate today.
</P>
<P>
   There are many plausible versions of how and why Reagan chose
George Bush as his running mate, but most are wide of the mark. One
conventional view is that Reagan, about to be nominated, recognized
that he ``needed a moderate'' like Bush to balance the ticket;
another version has it that Reagan, supposedly unschooled in
foreign affairs, saw the wisdom of naming someone with extensive
experience in the field to offset his own shortcomings. Yet another
explanation holds that Reagan, a Californian, needed ``geographic
balance'' and got that in Bush, with his Connecticut and Texas
lineage.
</P>
<P>
   These explanations are wrong. George Bush was picked at the very
last moment and largely by a combination of chance and some
behind-the-scenes maneuvering. Many Reagan advisers have claimed a
deal was never close. The post-convention media commentary has
largely reflected this view. In fact, Meese and Deaver have gone so
far as to declare that Bush was their first choice all along. I
take exception to their account. I saw a very different story
unfold, and saw it from a privileged vantage point. From the moment
I walked into that suite until the moment Bush was finally
selected, I was the only person to remain in Reagan's presence
throughout the adventure. With detailed notes to back up my memory,
this is what I saw at the dawn of the Reagan Revolution on that
long night in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan's search for a vice president started as soon as
he clinched the nomination with a string of primary victories in
the spring of 1980. Before long, a short list of prospective
running mates had been put together, including Howard Baker,
William Simon, Jack Kemp, Richard Lugar, Paul Laxalt and George
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   None of these prospective running mates were actually ``vetted''
in the way the process works today. Reagan knew all these men in
varying degrees, but as was his style, he expected his advisers to
do what was necessary to prune the list. The job fell largely to Ed
Meese, who knew Reagan's mind better than anyone except Nancy
Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until several weeks before the convention that Gerald
Ford's name entered into the mix. While it has never been
established how it happened, most attribute it to Bryce Harlow, a
respected adviser to Eisenhower, Nixon and Ford. Harlow probably
initiated the idea in a discussion with his friend, William Casey,
who then took it to Reagan and Meese.
</P>
<P>
   As the convention approached, the Ford rumors became stronger.
Although Reagan was running even with or behind President Carter in
most polls, the idea struck several of us on the senior staff as a
highly impractical, if not silly, idea. After all, Reagan and Ford
had fought intensely for the nomination in 1976. In 1980, the GOP
platform carried Reagan's conservative message down the line. Its
foreign policy planks in particular were, under cover of assailing
Carter, a de facto indictment of the Nixon-Ford-Kissinger policy of
detente with the Soviet Union. Unlike many of his predecessors,
Reagan actually believed in the platform and was determined to see
it put in place. The platform alone, we thought, would make a
Reagan-Ford ticket unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   In Reagan's suite, however, the unthinkable had become the
possible. In less than 24 hours, Reagan was going to have to go
before the convention to announce his vice-presidential nominee.
And yet for reasons that to this day remain baffling, not only had
Reagan given his political advisers free rein to negotiate with
Ford, he had also refrained from initiating conversations with
other potential running mates. With no alternate plan in sight, it
seemed that Reagan was prepared to embrace the wing of the
Republican Party that had ridiculed him, probably disliked him and
would surely do its best to undermine his agenda.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:50 p.m., Casey and Meese, who had left the suite shortly
after my arrival, returned. They seemed pensive. Lyn Nofziger, a
longtime aide, joined us a few minutes later, asking, ``What did
Ford want?'' Reagan again described the deal being negotiated,
complete with Ford's demands for Kissinger and Alan Greenspan,
adding, ``I thought that was more than a little sacrifice.'' Then
Reagan went to his bedroom to take a short nap. He knew it would be
a long night.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 6:30, Kissinger entered the suite to talk to
Meese, evidence that a serious negotiation was indeed in progress.
Half an hour later, he emerged; we chatted briefly, but Kissinger
revealed nothing of the talks. Meese, who was similarly guarded,
said that Kissinger wanted to proceed with discussions. This was
serious.
</P>
<P>
   And so I did something rash: I decided to try to contact George
Bush. Until that moment, the campaign inner circle had treated
important issues in a collegial manner; there had been no secrets
among us. But on this issue, Casey, Meese, Wirthlin and Deaver were
keeping the lid on. If my colleagues could play it close to the
vest on such a crucial issue, it was a game that could be played by
others as well.
</P>
<P>
   Although nominally still on a list of frequently mentioned
running mates, George Bush was not really on Reagan's radar screen.
Apart from serious policy differences, Bush had refused to admit
defeat in the primary battles despite being vanquished by Reagan in
29 of 33 primaries and did not withdraw from the race until just
before the California primary in June. Reagan considered the
belated departure willful and unnecessary and was offended by it.
Still, I thought Bush a viable alternative to Ford. Despite the
unsettled relations between the two, Bush could bring more to the
ticket to help Reagan than anyone on the list of choices.
</P>
<P>
   There was no question that a Bush candidacy would be a hard
sell. Among Reagan's advisers, Nofziger and Casey viewed Bush as a
liberal, and others were almost unanimously against him, some even
contemptuous. I considered Bush a capable man whose positions were
actually much closer to Reagan's than were Ford's, especially on
foreign policy and defense matters. In 1978, Bush had requested my
assistance on his campaign, but my commitment to Reagan was firm.
Of the Reagan inner circle, I had the clearest channel to Bush and
knew him the best.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 7:30, I reached Stefan Halper, a Bush aide.
Talking to him from the nearly empty suite, I asked him, in as
circumspect a manner as possible, to seek Bush's assurance that he
could support the platform ``with no exceptions.'' Halper knew what
I meant: Was Bush interested in the job? Would he implicitly
abandon his support for abortion and his opposition to supply-side
economics by embracing the platform? I then called an old friend,
Richard Fairbanks, to ask him to approach Bush with the same
question. I wanted two sources of independent confirmation and knew
Fairbanks was close to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Reagan emerged from his bedroom refreshed by the
catnap and sat down in front of three muted television sets in the
suite. Within moments, Gerald Ford appeared on CBS with Walter
Cronkite, and Reagan asked that the volume be turned up. Cronkite
wasted no time asking Ford if he and Reagan were discussing a
``co-presidency,'' which Ford affirmed by not disagreeing. Reagan
looked appalled.
</P>
<P>
   After the broadcast, the room cleared out. Reagan and I were
alone. Reluctant to question him, but knowing that another track
could never be started unless he agreed to it, I asked Reagan why
he would not simply issue a statement denying that he had agreed to
a co-presidency. There was a sense of resignation in his voice when
he said, ``I can't.'' After a few seconds, he said aloud, almost
rhetorically, ``Who else is there?''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's Bush,'' I suggested, half expecting him to close off
the discussion. Instead, he paused and then said, ``I can't take
him; that 'voodoo economic policy' charge and his stand on abortion
are wrong.'' Sensing an opportunity, I reached for a copy of the
platform lying on the coffee table, passed it to him and said,
``Governor, this is your platform, every word of it.'' I added that
Martin Anderson, Reagan's chief domestic policy adviser, Peter
Hannaford and I had scrutinized it carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you could be assured that George Bush would support this
platform in every detail,'' I asked, ``would you reconsider Bush?''
Reagan mulled this for a moment and then said, deliberately,
``Well, if you put it that way, I would agree to reconsider.'' The
opening emerged.
</P>
<P>
   At 7:50 Fairbanks called to say that Bush could indeed embrace
the platform; soon thereafter, Halper phoned with the same message.
Meanwhile, negotiations with Ford continued upstairs on the 70th
floor, with Casey, Meese, Deaver and Wirthlin representing Reagan,
and Greenspan, Kissinger and the Ford advisers John O. Marsh,
Robert Barrett representing the former president. Reagan continued
to sit before the televisions, snacking on his favorite jelly
beans. Sen. Bob Dole appeared with the television commentator Max
Robinson and declared that ``Ford and Reagan can work it out.''
Reagan commented, softly: ``No, Bob. I cannot give him what he
wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing another opening, I then informed Reagan that Bush had
given unequivocal assurances that he could embrace and defend the
entire platform, emphasizing ``with no exceptions.'' He listened
carefully, but did not respond. I simply could not read his
reaction, and the thought crossed my mind that he was angry that I
had opened a channel to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   At 8:05, Reagan announced to no one in particular, doesn't Ford
``realize there is no way in the world I can accept? What kind of
presidential candidate would I be in the eyes of the world if I
were to give in to such demands?'' It seemed odd that despite his
instincts, Reagan did not call a halt to the talks. It seemed odd,
too, that so many of those who felt uncomfortable about the deal
remained quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Just before 8:30, Meese reported progress: Ford had modified his
demands and now wanted to be ``chairman'' of the National Security
Council. The notion should have been rejected outright, as the
president is the head of the NSC. A few minutes later, Anderson and
Deaver rejoined the group in the suite, and Deaver told Reagan that
Ford would like to speak to him on the phone. At 8:55, Reagan went
into his bedroom to call Ford. He returned five minutes later,
reporting that Ford had told him that Kissinger ``now takes himself
out'' of the running for secretary of state. It was clear that Ford
and Greenspan had not taken themselves out of anything.
</P>
<P>
   By 9:30, Sam Donaldson was reporting that Reagan would go to the
arena with Ford in a matter of hours, reinforcing speculation about
the ``dream ticket,'' and at 9:45, Cronkite announced that Ford and
Kissinger were meeting with Reagan operatives. At 9:50, Meese came
into the room: ``We're wanted upstairs'' in Ford's suite.
</P>
<P>
   At 10:05, former Treasury Secretary William Simon entered, and
Reagan and I sat with him in a corner. Simon, who had been
mentioned as a vice-presidential candidate, was determined to stop
the deal in its tracks, which was surprising since he had served in
Ford's cabinet. ``Ron, take me out of this,'' he told Reagan. ``But
under no circumstances take Ford.'' Simon, never a man to mince
words, left; he had made a deep impression on Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   By 10:45, Casey and Meese returned to the suite to present the
latest version of the deal. ``It's kind of hard to describe how it
would work in practice,'' Meese began. ``The president will
nominate the secretaries of state and treasury, with the veto of
the vice president. The vice president will name the director of
the Office of Management and Budget and the national security
adviser with the veto of the president. It boils down to a mutual
veto power.'' In this version, Kissinger, ``taken out'' as
secretary of state, would run foreign policy from the vice
president's office.
</P>
<P>
   At that late hour, despite its obvious and fundamental flaws and
without any sort of backup plan, our side seemed determined to try
to make this constantly changing arrangement work. It was almost
surreal: how could a president limit his constitutional powers and
prerogatives by allowing a vice president to veto his choices?
</P>
<P>
   Just before 11, Nancy Reagan and the Reagan children came in to
watch the convention roll call. At 11:13, Montana put Reagan over
the top, and there was jubilation. At the moment of triumph,
though, the negotiators were not present; they remained upstairs,
locked in discussions. Meanwhile, the convention was drawing to a
close _ if the Ford talks went on much longer, and failed, there
would be no way to heal the disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of the preceding hour, I had told Hannaford,
Anderson and Nofziger that a channel had been opened to Bush and
that Bush was on board with the platform. Hannaford then began to
argue that the logjam had to be broken. He collected Deaver and
Nofziger at the entrance to the suite and mounted the stairs to
tell the negotiators that a decision was needed.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:25, the negotiators returned; Casey reported that ``the
answer is probably no.'' Five minutes later, Ford, accompanied by
Barrett, entered the suite to talk with Reagan, and we left the
room. The two men spent a few minutes alone, and at 11:35, Ford
departed. We rushed back into the room, and Reagan said: ``I have
to say the answer is no. All this time, my gut instinct has been
that this is not the right thing. I have affection and respect for
Ford. He said he would go all out to help.'' There was complete
silence.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan glanced around and asked those assembled _ a group that
included Casey, Meese, Wirthlin, Hannaford, Deaver and me _ ``Well,
what do we do now?'' There was no immediate response. No one
offered an alternate plan. No one tossed out a name.
</P>
<P>
   Expecting instant opposition, I ventured, ``We call Bush.'' Once
more, silence. Reagan again looked at each of us; hearing no
objection, he said, ``Well, let's get Bush on the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   At precisely 11:38, the phone was in Reagan's hand; though they
barely knew each other, Reagan dove right in. ``George,'' he said
warmly, ``I would like to go over there and tell them that I am
recommending you for vice president. Could I ask you one thing _ do
I have your permission to make an announcement that you support the
platform across the board?'' We could hear Bush agreeing at the
other end. Reagan then left for the convention center where,
shortly after midnight, he took the podium to praise Ford and then
to announce his running mate, George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   And so it came to pass that Ronald Reagan averted what would
have been a disaster for his candidacy and the Republican Party.
The following morning, Ed Meese called us together and declared the
official line should be that the process of selecting a running
mate had been orderly and measured and that there ``never was a
deal with Ford'' for the vice presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, he's right, since no deal was ever consummated.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, while on the campaign plane, I asked Deaver what
was in his mind as he sat in those discussions. He thought for a
moment and said, ``Look, I'm a guy from Sacramento, Calif., and
there I was sitting at a negotiating table with Henry Kissinger,
and Kissinger had negotiated with Mao.'' Astonished, I waited for
something more, then asked, ``And so, that's it?'' He looked at me
as if I didn't understand and said, sharply: ``Of course that's it.
I was sitting right there!''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Kissinger, no stranger to balky negotiations,
later told The Washington Post that ``if it had been possible for
both the principals to go to bed, sleep on it, meet again in the
morning, we could have wrapped up this thing in two hours in the
morning,'' adding, ``That's how close it was.'' And I believe him.

&HT;     CHELSEA WILL PLAY HOOKEY THIS FALL TO HELP HILLARY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By HELEN THOMAS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Chelsea Clinton will miss classes at Stanford
University this fall to help her mother campaign for a Senate seat
from New York and to be around the White House when her father
winds up his last few months as president, according to a White
House aide.
</P>
<P>
   The aide said that Chelsea, 20, a senior at Stanford, will still
be able to graduate in June because she has racked up enough
credits.
</P>
<P>
   After zealously guarding her privacy for years, the President
and Mrs. Clinton are allowing the public spotlight to fall on their
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Chelsea was very visible as her father's companion during the
Mideast summit talks and walks at Camp David. She even attended
dinners with the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat where the substantive issues were discussed.
</P>
<P>
   So it was natural that she would be sitting in the White House
press room when a despondent Clinton announced the collapse of the
intensive, two-week-long negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   She kept her eyes on the podium and avoided contact with the
reporters in the room.
</P>
<P>
   While Americans will see more of her in the limelight of the
White House, she actually has had more public exposure abroad,
having traveled to several continents with her mother.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   White House aides were shocked by the vitriolic fundraising
letters sent by William Powers, New York Republican chairman,
demonizing Hillary Rodham Clinton and her senatorial candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Powers hardly skipped any derogatory adjectives in his missives
soliciting donations from the party faithful.
</P>
<P>
   One letter addressed to ``Dear Friend'' called the first lady
``opportunistic, hypocritical, and egotistical.`` Powers goes on to
say she is ``abrasive and annoying, brash and bitter, calculating
and scheming, distant and deceitful, polarizing and power hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that ``in her ruthless quest for power, she claims to
be a 'New Democrat' but ``she's a fraud, a phony and a pretender.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only a matter of time,'' Powers wrote, ``before she
attempts to become President Hillary Rodham Clinton. Our nation
couldn't survive that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It just shows that some campaigns spend more time on personal
insults than on the substantive issues and that's the only way they
can attempt to get elected,'' a White House aide said.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent editorial, the Buffalo News said: ``Powers' bitter
personal attack on Democratic candidate Hillary Rodham
Clinton...should be an embarrassment to both the party and its
candidate who has publicly aspired to a higher standard.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper editorial also commented that Powers' blast puts
the credibility of her opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio's, ``on the line
when it comes to mounting an issue-oriented campaign that he
promised and the voters deserved.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only in America: At a ceremony in the White House State Dining
Room, President Clinton presented Connie Mariano, the White House
physician, with shoulder boards promoting her to the rank of rear
admiral in the Navy. Mariano's Filipino-American relatives burst
with pride as they witnessed her promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano, 45, a White House staffer since February 1994, has come
a long way for a woman in the Navy hierarchy. Always calm and
professional, she likes to point out that her father, Angel
Mariano, served six admirals as a steward, the only job Filipinos
could hold when he joined the Navy shortly after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Basking in the warmth of well wishers and old friends, Mariano
said: ``I am pleased to stand before you today as proof that
Filipino-Americans in the Navy no longer must go through the
kitchen, the back door or garage.''
</P>
<P>
   She and her medical staff have administered to the president and
vice president and their families as well as the hundreds of
employees in the White House compound.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of Clinton's term in January, Mariano may take
another command or retire from the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The late pharmaceutical tycoon Justin Dart, Sr., a powerful
member of President Ronald Reagan's ``kitchen cabinet,'' might have
been startled at the high praise his son heaped on President
Clinton at a ceremony commemorating the 10th anniversary of the
American With Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   Wheelchair-bound from a post-polio affliction, Justin Dart Jr.,
is considered the father of the campaign to have the disabilities
law enacted during the Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   He told the ceremony at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Memorial: ``I
love Bill Clinton. But even if I didn't, his record would command
my respect...Like Abraham Lincoln, Bill Clinton has fought to
preserve the authority of our federal union to guarantee the rights
of its citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Dart told the president that his ``continuing leadership'' was
needed ``to help millions of disabled Americans who are still
unemployed, poor, in prison and in nursing institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, delivered a moving speech and
``signed'' his remarks when he related that his commitment to
disability was aroused by his brother, Frank, who died a month ago.
As a young man Frank Harkin couldn't get a driver's license because
he was told `deaf people don't drive.''
</P>
<P>
   Harkin said that when his brother was sent to school for the
``deaf and dumb,'' he said, ``I may be deaf but I'm not dumb.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons traveled twice to Fayetteville, Ark., to visit
their old friend, Diane Blair, a professor at the University of
Arkansas, before she died of lung cancer. They also attended a
memorial service for her in Fayetteville where the first lady
spoke, telling several stories about her friendship with Blair who
shared her feminist outlook and love of tennis. Mrs. Clinton said
Blair who had good eyesight and ``never dropped a stitch when
working on needlepoint'' sometimes wore oversize glasses as a gag.
</P>
<P>
   The president laughed at times during a video showing Blair as a
young girl on a tricycle, as a professor addressing her students at
commencement and as a ``prankster wearing a Richard Nixon mask and
flashing the V sign.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Richard Cheney, who is Texas Gov. George W. Bush's choice of
running mate, is going to have a hard time defining himself as an
``outsider'' the way Bush would like to depict the GOP ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians from both parties are typically tempted to distance
themselves from Washington when they run for high office.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, 59, is a Washington fixture, having arrived first as a
congressional aide years ago. He later became a Nixon
administration aide, President Ford's White House chief of staff, a
six-term congressman from Wyoming and defense secretary in
President Bush's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he rushed back to Wyoming from Texas where he is an
oil company CEO, to register to vote in his native state. But he
and his wife still maintain a home in McLean, Va., a wealthy suburb
of Washington.

&HT;     SAN ANTONIO GOES AFTER PROVACATIVE WEB SITES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROY BRAGG  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The controversy that has swirled around
Rackspace.com this week for hosting Web sites displaying
provocative images of nude children isn't the San Antonio company's
first brush with the issue.
</P>
<P>
   On May 5, Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon slapped the firm,
which offers Web space for hire, with a cease-and-desist order for
hosting a Web site that contained sexually explicit photos of
girls.
</P>
<P>
   Rackspace.com officials moved very quickly to remove the site,
Nixon spokesman Scott Holste said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very cooperative with us,'' Holste said of year-old
Rackspace.com. ``As soon as they got that order faxed to them, they
took that site down. It was a situation where Rackspace was caught
in the middle, but they reacted well.''
</P>
<P>
   In issuing the cease-and-desist order, Missouri's Nixon claimed
the Web site, which is now defunct, violated that state's consumer
protection laws by falsely claiming that advertising and selling
the images of children did not violate federal law.
</P>
<P>
   But Rackspace.com was hit with criticism again this week, when
an anti-child pornography group complained that it has been hosting
more than a dozen Internet sites that feature pictures of nude
children, and the company was confronted by the San Antonio
Express-News.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Rackspace.com's chief executive, Graham Weston,
vowed to follow through on his promise, made a day earlier, to
remove the 13 sexually explicit sites -- all of which prominently
feature pictures of nude minors -- from the company's computer
servers.
</P>
<P>
   And he promised to remove any further sites brought to his
attention that depict children in any sexually explicit situations.
Rackspace.com will continue its policy of offering free server
space to any child-advocacy organization, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Had the sites been deemed illegal by law enforcement or a court
order, Rackspace.com could've pulled the plug immediately, Weston
said. But since the cancellation of service is based instead on
Rackspace.com's desire to get rid of the sites, the contracts
stipulate the company give the site owners 30 days' notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I doubt it will take most of them that long (to move
their sites off Rackspace.com servers),'' Weston said.
</P>
<P>
   Weston defended his actions in the handling of the situation,
saying that it's impossible for him or his 130-person staff to
monitor the tens of thousands of Web pages on the company's 2,000
servers.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with Better A Millstone, a Monterey, Calif.-based
children's advocacy group, said they have tried since April to
convince Rackspace.com's staff to shut down the controversial
sites, but were stonewalled.
</P>
<P>
   The Rackspace.com staff, Weston said, was following company
policy, which was to remove illegal pages. None of the pages
involved, however, has been found to be pornographic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know every single thing that goes on (at
Rackspace.com),'' he said. ``I didn't have any knowledge of these
sites. We have never condoned (those types of images), and we have
gone a step further than any other company would.''
</P>
<P>
   He likened his position to that of a cyberlandlord.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like we own an apartment complex,'' he said. ``What you
do in your unit, we don't know about (until someone complains).''
</P>
<P>
   The Web-hosting business is based on computer servers, which are
housed en masse in big rooms dubbed ``server farms.'' Companies
contract with Rackspace.com to rent a server, and that company is
responsible for the content that's placed on it, Weston said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like they send us material and we put it up for
them,'' he said. ``They don't share information with us. They get
full access. We give them passwords, and they do everything else.
We're not involved in what they do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's technically impossible to (watch all of the sites
generated by customers),'' he said. ``We'd need an army of people
to pull that off. And that's why we rely on people to call us and
alert us to these sites.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had been illegal, we'd have already shut them down,''
he said. ``We don't like what they show. We decided to take a stand
on it. And we're probably the only company that has taken this
stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Aaron, who runs San Francisco-based MySpace.com, an online
storage company that also hosts Web pages, says his company's
policy is to remove any material that exploits children, even if it
doesn't fit the legal definition of child pornography.
</P>
<P>
   When Better A Millstone notified MySpace.com of objectionable
material last year, the staff was at a company party. But the site
was yanked within an hour, said Aaron and Better A Millstone
founder Mike Echols.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron agreed with Weston's assessment that it's impossible to
police every Web page stored on a firm's computer servers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be brought to our attention because of the privacy
involved,'' he said. ``We aren't aware of what (consumers) are
storing. We rely on people out there, surfing the Web, who see the
pages and call us.''
</P>
<P>
   Children's advocates applauded Rackspace.com's move. Julie
Posey, who runs the Lafayette, Colo.-based site Pedowatch.org, said
explicit pictures of children can be found all over the Internet
and on the servers of lots of companies besides Rackspace.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all over the Web,'' Posey said.
</P>
<P>
   Echols was pleased but wary of Rackspace.com's change of heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to see it, but I'm not happy to see his remarks,''
Echols said of Weston. ``He hasn't gotten religion yet.''
</P>
<P>
   By that, Echols meant that Rackspace.com only reacted because of
pressure exerted by his group and the Express-News inquiry into the
sites. He said his organization is prepared to bring more pressure
onto Rackspace.com.
</P>
<P>
   Echols wants Weston's company to become more aggressive in
seeking out and eliminating all exploitative pictures of children
off the company's servers, even before complaints arrive.
</P>
<P>
   He said Better A Millstone can influence the company's policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can organize and we can send hundreds of e-mails to their
other customers,'' he said. ``We've done it before. We've sent out
e-mails hundreds at a whack.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will leave them in droves.''

&HT;     SCIENCE GIVE EYES TO BLIND SUBTERRANEAN FISH 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In caves in northeastern Mexico, underground
ponds house eerie occupants: ghostly fish without eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The subterranean darkness made eyes unnecessary. So evolution
eliminated them hundreds of thousands or millions of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Experimenters have figured out how to restore eyes to these
creatures by indirectly switching on the gene or genes that
regulate eye development.
</P>
<P>
   These blind cave fish are unwittingly helping scientists better
understand one of the most fascinating phenomena in evolution:
atavisms.
</P>
<P>
   Atavisms are supposedly vanished evolutionary traits that, from
time to time, reappear in a plant or animal species.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the ancestors of modern horses had multiple toes.
The genes for multiple toes still exist in modern horses, but are
silent, genetically speaking. Still, in very rare instances, a
naturalist records seeing a horse with at least partial formation
of toes.
</P>
<P>
   Now two University of Maryland researchers have figured how to
bring atavisms back to life _ so to speak _ in blind cave fish, by
making them grow eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Their achievement is a bizarre example of how primeval traits
that we carry in our genes are no longer expressed _ to use
genetics lingo _ because we don't need them and they have been
excised by evolution.
</P>
<P>
   All that remains is a genetic record of those traits, a record
that passes via DNA down through the eons. It's like an attic full
of instruction manuals for antique devices like crystal radios and
kerosene lamps.
</P>
<P>
   Some day, perhaps, a nuclear war will wreak havoc on
civilization; at that time those old instruction manuals could be
useful, because humanity might again have to make crystal radios
and kerosene lamps. Nature works like that, too: When the
environment changes radically, it selects for survival the lucky
few blessed with atavistic traits that prove ideal for the new
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, humans with extremely heavy body hair are rare
nowadays, but they'd rank among the most likely survivors of a
future ice age.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to blind cave fish: They're a few inches
long and a pale yellowish-white or pinkish-white color. They are
descendants of an older, sighted fish species that still inhabits
surface waters.
</P>
<P>
   Over geological time, underground streams carved caves. A few
fish were sucked into the caves and thrived there. Over hundreds of
thousands or millions of years, their eyes proved useless in the
dark. Hence their eyes gradually disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   But the blind cave fish retained some basic structural
components of eyes. (Likewise, modern snakes, which are legless,
retain useless pelvic girdles that once supported their ancestors'
limbs.)
</P>
<P>
   The Maryland scientists, Yoshiyuki Yamamoto and William R.
Jeffery, have given blind cave fish back their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   They did it by removing lenses from the eyes of their sighted
cousins, then implanting the lenses in the eyes of young blind cave
fish.
</P>
<P>
   To their amazement, the blind cave fish grew fully restored
eyes, each of which included ``a distinct pupil, cornea and iris,''
according to a summary of their work released by the University of
Maryland. Somehow, they infer, the lens implantation told the fish
genes to trigger the formation of complete eyes.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether the eyes can actually see, however. For
now, ``we are not sure what gene is inactivating cave fish (eye
genes)'' in untreated fish, Yamamoto said in a phone interview
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   An extended report by Yamamoto and Jeffery on their work appears
in Friday's issue of Science magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Yamamoto, 34, has a doctorate in biology. Until 1997 Jeffery was
a researcher at the Bodega Marine Laboratory, which is run by
UC-Davis at Bodega Bay. Now 56, he chairs the biology department at
the University of Maryland at College Park.
</P>
<P>
   Gruelling effort, and no small amount of danger, was required to
recover the blind cave fish from their otherworldly habitat,
hundreds of feet beneath the Mexican desert.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffery credits David Martasian and his cave-exploring
colleagues at the Bodega Marine Laboratory for helping obtain the
fish used in the experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Several times in recent years, Martasian has descended into the
Mexican caves on his belly. Wielding a flashlight and wearing a
miner's helmet, he has crawled through muddy, narrow passageways
into the depths. Usually he is accompanied by several other
explorers.
</P>
<P>
   During Martasian's descents, shy vampire bats hang from the
ceiling and nervously monitor the unfamiliar sound of his huffing
and puffing.
</P>
<P>
   With luck, after crawling for hundreds of feet, the 31-year-old
biologist hears the sound of dripping water: ``You shine the
flashlight and there are all these little white fish swimming
around. . . . It's really cool.''
</P>
<P>
   And none of them has eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Martasian fears for the future of the blind cave fish.
</P>
<P>
   Although they inhabit one of the world's most isolated
ecosystems, the little creatures are threatened by human
activities. On the surface, farmers burn foliage in order to open
up more agricultural land.
</P>
<P>
   Normally foliage stabilizes soil movement. Hence its
disappearance allows rain to wash more mud into the caves. As a
result, the mud buries the dark ponds and their sightless little
inhabitants.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It happened while I was working out at my local gym not long
ago, warming up on a treadmill and humming a jazzy tune. From the
treadmill next to me came the sound of a woman giving a speech
about economic policy. I turned to look, and sure enough, a fellow
exerciser was reading out loud from a set of 3-by-5 index cards she
held firmly while she ran 12-minute miles.
</P>
<P>
   Another time, another song. A man on an adjacent Stairmaster was
editing legal articles, scribbling in the margins (and dotting the
pages with perspiration) as he listened to music on his headphones.
</P>
<P>
   Still another afternoon, a phone rang. It was the Lifecycle next
to me. A man wearing a ``Just Do It'' T-shirt answered his cell
phone and gazed up at a ceiling-mounted television tuned to a
financial channel. ``Sell!'' he shouted.
</P>
<P>
   This was beginning to feel like a trend. Eager to learn more, I
sought out the man on the Stairmaster and asked him why he had
chosen to take his work to his workout.
</P>
<P>
   He turned out to be Ken Anderson, a 44-year-old law professor at
American University in Washington, who replied that he was pressed
for time, juggling his family, job and five workouts a week. ``It's
the only way I can justify my time at the gym,'' he said. ``I can't
afford to be checked out of the day for two straight hours. It's a
time management thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Occhipinti, the president of American Fitness Professionals
and Associates, a certification and educational organization in
Ship Bottom, N.J., confirms that Anderson has lots of company.
``It's a fitness trend of big cities and affluent suburbs, where
people need information and are very stressed,'' Occhipinti said.
``It's a symptom of our time.''
</P>
<P>
   Health clubs, once havens for relaxation, have responded to the
new demands by providing equipment that enables members to mix
efficiency with exercise. Televisions are tuned to the news,
courtesy phones are within easy reach, and at some clubs, Netpulse
stations (computers providing Internet access) are attached to
Lifecycle and Stairmaster machines. They enable members to do work
(and earn frequent-flier miles from Netpulse's airline sponsors for
every mile they pedal or step), from their gym-desks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fact of life that people are busy,'' said Maeve
McCaffrey, a spokeswoman for the International Health, Racquet and
Sportsclub Association, a trade group in Boston. ``If members need
to be productive while they exercise, we are going to do everything
we can to make it easier for them to enjoy their time at the gym.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is convinced that this is a good idea. ``Doing
anything while on the treadmill is dangerous,'' said Dr. Nicholas
DiNubile, an orthopedic surgeon in Havertown, Pa., who is an
adviser to the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports.
``Talking on cell phones or reading while exercising can cause
nerve strain in the head and neck. Workout form is important.''
</P>
<P>
   Multitasking may be an efficient use of gym time, but it
compromises the quality of a workout, said Matt Johns, the former
director of operations at the Regency Sport and Health Club in
McLean, Va. ``You still burn calories, but the workout is not the
same,'' he said. ``There has to be a mind-body connection.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Brown, a behavioral scientist with the federal Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, said that although there was
little research on working while working out, ``in general,
disassociating from the exercise experience, by doing something
other than exercise, can lead to risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Occhipinti knows that firsthand: he once saw a man fall and
break his arm while reading on a treadmill. But he adds that health
clubs are reluctant to reproach their clients. ``It's a delicate
situation,'' he said. ``You don't want to offend or upset the
client. We try to educate them about safety, but people are going
to do what they want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Cotton, the chief exercise physiologist for the American
Council on Exercise, a nonprofit watchdog organization in San
Diego, agreed. ``Clubs provide all sorts of equipment _ TVs,
Netpulse, E-Zone,'' he said. ``It would be difficult to tell
someone not to use it.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond safety, however, is another concern. Despite the lack of
research, many experts share the view that people who take their
work to their workout are missing a prime benefit of exercise: its
ability to reduce stress. ``Exercise is one of the few leisure
activities for relaxation,'' DiNubile said. ``Working while working
out is a missed opportunity at stress reduction.''
</P>
<P>
   But he won't find much sympathy at my health club. ``Working
while working out is stress-reducing,'' Anderson said. ``I'm away
from my office, the computer, and I'm further ahead in my work.
It's a sanity-saving device.''

 ANTIQUERS SEEKING AMERICANA FLOCK TO NEW HAMPSHIRE

 (ART ADV: Photos of antiques from last year's New Hampshire shows
are available on Newscom or by calling William Gonzalez at c.2000 Hearst Communications Inc.
 World rights 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In August 1957, the first New Hampshire Antiques Show _
sponsored by the New Hampshire Antiques Dealers Association _ was
held in two small rooms in Concord's New Hampshire Highway Hotel.
Seventeen dealers displayed Windsor chairs, hand-carved decoys,
pewter chargers, step-back cupboards and other American treasures.
</P>
<P>
   According to East Hebron, N.H., dealer Howard Oedel, one of the
event's founders and still an exhibitor, the show attracted a
lively following right from the beginning. ``The original group was
small,'' Oedel recalls, ``but enthusiasm was high and the caliber
of objects exceptional.''
</P>
<P>
   Few of those pioneers could have imagined that 43 years later,
the NHADA New Hampshire Antiques Show _ now held in the Center of
New Hampshire Holiday Inn in Manchester _ would still be going
strong, attracting thousands of enthusiasts annually and sparking a
weeklong celebration of Americana.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the antiquing highlight of the summer,'' says collector,
appraiser and ``Country Living'' contributing editor Helaine
Fendelman, who has attended the show for nearly 20 years. ``There
are so many things to see and so many dealers to speak with. Simply
observing the wide range of objects is an education process in
itself''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the variety of items offered for sale _ painted
furniture, trade signs, folk portraits, redware pottery, and
colorful quilts to name but a few _ regulars share a sense of
excitement about seeing so many high-quality pieces in one place.
</P>
<P>
   ``People plan vacations around this show and travel long
distances to get here,'' says Judith Milne, co-owner of Judith &AMP;
James Milne Antiques in New York City, and a first-time exhibitor
at the NHADA New Hampshire Antiques Show. ``It's one of the major
destinations on the antiquer's calendar: New York City in January,
Philadelphia in April and New Hampshire in August.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, New Hampshire's Antiques Week begins on August 5 with
a live auction and ends with the week's cornerstone event, the
65-dealer NHADA New Hampshire Antiques Show, August 10 to 12. The
week's events include the Americana Celebration Antiques Show on
August 8 and the Mid-Week in Manchester show on August 9 and 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``People wait all year long for this show,'' says Rye, N.H.,
dealer Russ Goldberger, a nine-year participant, along with his
wife, Karen. ``Exhibitors often hold on to their best pieces for a
good part of the year to bring them here.''
</P>
<P>
   What people consider to be their ``best'' has changed over the
years. Oedel notes that when he started doing the show 43 years
ago, ``art pottery, Dedham pottery and ephemera weren't really
collected; today they're in demand.''
</P>
<P>
   At last year's show, some of the top-quality items included
Victorian alphabet blocks, blue-and-white transferware, Hitchcock
chairs, green-glass apothecary bottles, a circa 1880 folk art
birdhouse and 18th- and 19th-century pewter.
</P>
<P>
   While novices and seasoned attendees alike know that it's a good
idea to arrive at an antiques show early for the best chance to
score the great items, Goldberger advises checking back
periodically throughout the show's run, explaining that most
dealers park antiques-filled trucks nearby so they can restock
their booths as pieces sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're interested in American country antiques, this event
is something you need to experience at least once in your life,''
Goldberger says. ``But don't be surprised if you start coming back
year after year.''
</P>
<P>
   PLANNING YOUR TRIP
</P>
<P>
   While in Manchester, you will not fail to see the Amoskeag
Mills, built in the 19th century. This complex of brick buildings
still stretches for a mile along the Merrimack River and was once
the largest textile factory in the world. The mill buildings now
house dozens of other industries.
</P>
<P>
   Manchester has an excellent fine art museum, the Currier Gallery
of Art, with collections of American decorative art and paintings
by significant Americans ranging from 19th-century portraitist Ammi
Phillips to such 20th-century artists as Andrew Wyeth, Edward
Hopper and Georgia O'Keefe.(Web site: www.currier.org)
</P>
<P>
   The Zimmerman house designed by Frank Lloyd Wright belongs to
the Currier and is open Friday through Monday. Visitors must take a
guided tour ($7) with advance reservations required. (603-626-4156)
</P>
<P>
   Nearby Concord, with a population of just over 36,000 people,
has been the capital of New Hampshire since 1808. The state
Legislature _ with 424 representatives, the largest in the nation _
still meets in its original chambers. The New Hampshire State
House, built in 1819, has exhibits about the state's history and is
open year-round.
</P>
<P>
   South of Manchester is America's Stonehenge _ 4,000-year-old
granite slabs of unknown origin. Their alignment suggests to
scientists that they were part of an ancient calendar constructed
by people who had sophisticated knowledge of the movements of the
sun, moon and stars. (Admission: $7.95. For more information, call
603-893-8300.)
</P>
<P>
   Accommodations in the Manchester area range from the 250-room
Center of New Hampshire Holiday Inn (603-625-1000) to cozy country
inns like the four-room Stillmeadow B&AMP;B (603-329-8381.) For a free
New Hampshire visitors' guide call 800-386-4664.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the antiques shows offer food on site. In addition,
two dealer favorites in Manchester are Cafe Pavone (603-622-5488)
and Shorty's Mexican Roadhouse (603-625-1730).

<P>
   One of the joys of living with pets is catching a glimpse of
what makes them tick. What we learn about our pets from experts,
friends, and, especially, our own observations _ sometimes
surprises us but ultimately helps us take better care of them. With
long-running contact, however, we sometimes come to take our pets
for granted. That's when we may miss a clue to understanding pet
behavior. Here are some situations that deserve a closer look.
</P>
<P>
   To communicate with our pets we need to listen as well as talk
to them. Does a dog howl, for instance, from loneliness? A dog that
is isolated from its family, either canine or human, may indeed cry
out for company, just as wolves locate one another in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   With their heightened pack identity, beagles especially are
prone to plaintive howling when left alone. But some breeds, like
my schipperke, Momo, who is rarely left all alone, just can't
resist replying to other dogs' howling. It is another throwback to
their wolf heritage: The pack sings as one recreationally early in
the morning and in the evening to initiate the hunt. In Momo's
case, the daily one o'clock firehouse siren inspires him to warble
along and other neighborhood dogs often join in the vocalizing.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first signs of illness for any animal is loss of
appetite. But is your cat sick or just a finicky eater? If it turns
food away, make sure first that there isn't a health problem by
asking your vet. After that, look on food preference as a
potentially serious problem in itself.
</P>
<P>
   According to ``CatWatch,'' the newsletter of the Cornell
University Feline Health Center in Ithaca, N.Y., some cats would
rather starve than eat food they don't like, and preferences can be
set as early as six months. Kittens raised on a varied diet develop
democratic palates.
</P>
<P>
   Housebreaking dogs calls for the use of a crate, but is it
really true that dogs never soil their crate? Most animals try to
keep their sleeping area clean, but that doesn't mean you can count
on it. Puppies have to learn control, and they can't be expected to
wait for unreasonably long periods. A puppy should be taken outside
immediately after eating and drinking, and no adult dog should have
to wait longer than 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   No dog _ adult or puppy _ should be held in a crate for more
than four hours at a stretch. The crate should be large enough for
the dog to stand, turn around and lie down comfortably, but not so
large that there will be room set aside for eliminating.
</P>
<P>
   And when the dog is in the yard, how best to fence it in?
``Invisible,'' that is, electric- or sonar-producing fences, keep
the landscape clear and may cost less than traditional fencing.
Pain, however, is the tool. Even if, as some argue, the pain may be
mild, you must decide if you desire these conditions for your pet's
overall well-being.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the fences are rendered ineffectual when dogs dash
through them in hot pursuit of a squirrel or another dog, then
won't come back for fear of the shock that awaits them. If you
don't want to erect a wooden fence, try planting evergreens around
your property, then linking them with barely visible garden wire.
</P>
<P>
   Taking your dog with you on outings is fun, but the dog should
ride inside the cab if you drive a pickup truck. Sudden braking,
swerves or bumps in the road can send a dog flying out of the back
of the truck and airborne debris can also cause injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``If absolutely necessary,'' recommends Michael Kaufmann, the
American Humane Association's director of educational programs, in
Englewood, Colo., ``a dog can be put in a crate that is securely
fastened to the truck bed.'' Some states have laws against dogs
riding in the backs of trucks.
</P>
<P>
   For cats, outdoor adventures often include vigorous tree
climbing. Cats love to sink their claws into rough bark and shoot
straight up the trunk. Sometimes, though, they glue themselves to a
branch and refuse to come down. The reason is not that they're
afraid of the height, but that their anatomy is better suited to
ascent than descent.
</P>
<P>
   John Hermanson, associate professor of biomedical sciences at
Cornell University's College of Veterinary Medicine, in Ithaca,
N.Y., explains, ``Squirrels and some other arboreal mammals have
specialized capabilities that allow them to rotate their ankles
nearly 180 degrees while climbing head-first down the trunk of a
tree.'' Since cats don't have this ability, you may have to haul
out the ladder to help them down. You can try benign neglect first:
Cats often creep down by themselves without the stress of people
surrounding them.
</P>
<P>
   One situation fraught with tension is a dogfight. Even though
your dog may be on a leash, someone else's may not be. Or two dogs
might be playing seemingly peacefully in the park when_ without
warning _ a fight breaks out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first instinct _ to try to break up the fight by yelling
or grabbing our dogs _ is not the correct solution,'' warns Michael
Kaufmann of the AHA. In the intensity of the moment, your own dog
could inadvertently bite you; yelling only heightens the emotional
turmoil. Instead, drop your leash and pause.
</P>
<P>
   Most dogfights, however terrifying, last only seconds. But if a
small dog is being victimized or if the fight doesn't end promptly,
try spraying the dogs with a hose, swinging a big stick or throwing
clothing into the fray to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the inner workings of our pets, the one we may least
understand is the powerful, seemingly interpsychic connection
between them and us. Rupert Sheldrake examines the ways animals
tune in to our behavior in his book ``Dogs That Know When Their
Owners Are Coming Home'' (Crown; 1999; $25).
</P>
<P>
   According to Sheldrake, the bonds between our companion animals
and ourselves may be so strong that they create a ``morphic
field,'' a physical connection that enables them to locate us
across distances and to anticipate our actions even before we
consciously know them ourselves. The deeper our bonds, it seems,
the more we learn about the nature of life itself.

<TEXT>
<P>
   I felt the screaming jolt, the split-second whine. Out in the
field behind the farmhouse, I was a curious child, too close to an
unsupervised, snarling buzz saw. One minute my left hand was tanned
brown from the Canadian summer, with slender fingers stained from
wild strawberries. One bump and one scream of the buzz saw later,
it was a bloody, mangled mess.
</P>
<P>
   That night Dr. Trefry cut it off. It was 1947. I was 14 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   I loathed my handless arm. For weeks I wouldn't even look at it
_ the monster arm that made me different. I tested out cans and
can'ts: Will boys like a 14-year-old girl with just one hand?
Braiding pigtails, playing the piano, tying shoes _ can I do it
with just one hand?
</P>
<P>
   I hated _ still hate _ the everyday game of ``let's pretend'':
people looking, looking twice, then pretending they didn't notice.
I wanted them to say, ``What happened to your hand?'' I wanted them
to make it ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   In a can-do family, my daddy saw me looking out at a world
defined by what I could not do. Daddy agonized. I was his youngest
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   He was braiding my pigtails, wrapping the ends in rubber bands
one day. ``Shall I tell you a secret, Mary, sweetheart?'' he asked.
``When Bertie first heard that you lost your hand, do you know what
he said to me?''
</P>
<P>
   I waited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bertie told me, `Now Mary can't ride her bicycle.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bertie was my little brother, not yet 7. I suspected he was
eyeing my new British Raleigh with its hand-grip brakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``And do you know what I said to him?'' Daddy paused. ``I told
him, `Well, I don't know why not.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why not'': I tacked the words in my heart like a
banner. And not just the words, but his believing in me.
</P>
<P>
   Mother, who wouldn't let any Taylor hide behind the nonsense of
``I can't,'' enrolled me at the college up the street for Hammond
organ lessons. I would play the keyboards with one hand and two
feet. And excuses about not doing dishes? ``A Taylor never says `I
can't,''' she would remind me as she lined me up with the rest. And
then she sat me down and taught me to crochet.
</P>
<P>
   When I lost my hand, the preacher's wife hoped out loud that God
would grow it back. He didn't.
</P>
<P>
   But he gave me daily triumphs.
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes, I have I-wish-I-had-my-hand days. I hate
eat-while-standing refreshments of every kind. If my one hand holds
the saucer, what hand will bring the cup of coffee to my lips?
</P>
<P>
   I hate every bottle cap that I can't open with just one hand.
And necklaces that I can't latch with just one hand. And bracelets
that won't slip on.
</P>
<P>
   I've had nightmares. After I wrenched my good shoulder a while
ago, my ultimate nightmare awoke me with cold sweats: my one and
only hand immobilized. I have no spare. I shudder at what-if's:
What if I couldn't dress myself? Drive to work? Wipe my bottom?
Write? Or feed myself? The aching terror of being dependent haunts
me.
</P>
<P>
   But you know what? It was hard to beat the high of seeing my
daughter skipping to church in her Easter Sunday dress that I
sewed. Or setting a record at the auction with a quilted wall
hanging that I pieced.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere deep inside, my cheering section shouts and stomps and
waves each time I do something someone thought I couldn't. When I
pinned my daughter's diapers. When I made the college volleyball
all-stars. When I tie my shoelaces. When I set my hair in curlers.
Small victories.
</P>
<P>
   Something cheers inside.
</P>

   ANTIQUERS SEEKING AMERICANA FLOCK TO NEW HAMPSHIRE
</P>
<P>
   NH-ANTIQUES-LIFEBEAT _ A week-long show in Manchester, N.H.,
sponsored by the New Hampshire Antiques Dealers Associaton, has
become ``the antiquing highlight of the summer,'' according to one
collector. ``People plan vacations around this show and travel long
distances to get here,'' says another. This year's show will take
place from August 5 to 12, but even if you miss it, there are
interesting things to see in and around Manchester.

   WORKING-WORKOUT-LIFEBEAT_ Work is the latest thing in working
out. Pressed for time, more and more people are bringing their
briefcases to the gym and ``multitasking'' while on the treadmill
or exercise bike. Doctors think this detracts from the exercise
experience, one benefit of which is to reduce stress. However, gyms
are cooperating with their clients. Some have even attached
Netpulse stations (computers providing Internet access) to their
Lifecycles and Stairmasters. By Daphne Palmer Geanacopoulos.

   JUST-ONE-HAND-LIFEBEAT _ In one second on a hot summer day in
1947, Mary Taylor Previte, now a New Jersey assemblywoman, lost her
left hand to a buzz saw. However, her parents wouldn't let her feel
sorry for herself. They encouraged her to do everything that she
would have done had the accident not occurred. Since then, she
recounts, whenever she does something that someone thought she
couldn't, ``something cheers inside.'' By Mary Taylor Previte.

   PETS-PSYCHOLOGY-LIFEBEAT _ Pets have both consciousness and
emotions. And one of the joys of living with them is catching a
glimpse of what makes them tick. Pets behave as they do for many
reasons. Why is your dog howling? Why isn't your cat eating? What's
the best way to housebreak your dog? The answers to these and other
questions are rooted in animal psychology. By Toni Gardner.

   TAKE-BOS  
 UNDATED: ... -- him.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He didn't have any football heroes because he didn't have any
interest in the game. He was as slow and timid as he was large, a
target for roving bullies, and it wasn't until he was 13 that he
``realized I didn't have to take this crap.''
</P>
<P>
   But he got a lot more out of those Albion adventures than black
eyes and bloody noses. ``It was sport in its purest form,'' says
Long. ``That's where I developed a love for competition. No adults.
Just kids playing all day long. And we seemed to settle things OK
for ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   That also was the case at home. The bond was ironclad, if not
traditional. ``I was fortunate,'' says Long, ``to have family
members who cared very much about me.'' It wasn't the classic
nuclear lineup. But the affection he received from his mother's
four brothers _ John, George, Mike, and Bill Mullan _ Bill's wife,
Aida; Mike's wife, Edie; and above all, Howie's maternal
grandmother, Elizabeth, known to one and all as ``Ma'' before her
death two years ago, was just as enduring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Howie didn't have a conventional upbringing,'' says Millen,
who got to know Long's family well during their Raider days. ``But
Ma Mullan loved him to death.''
</P>
<P>
   So much so, says Capone with a laugh, ``that if Ma walked into a
room and there was a dead body and Howie was standing on the other
side with a smoking gun, she'd say, `My Howie couldn't have done
that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe not to that extreme, but Long recalls, ``My
grandmother always thought that I was going to be something
special. Why I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone seemed to know one thing _ he wasn't going to be
especially successful if his environment didn't change drastically.
``I lacked discipline and direction,'' says Long, and in the
tumultuous days of court-ordered busing to integrate Boston's
schools, he also lacked a desire to attend class.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was supposed to go to Charlestown High,'' he says, ``But it
was surrounded by police. A lot of kids weren't going to school at
all. I think because no one was going, I wasn't about to say,
`Well, I'll be the first one to go to school.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So as a 13-year-old high school freshman, he majored in truancy.
Long says he missed 45 days of classes. Other published estimates
have ranged from 40 to 60. ``It's like trying to figure out exactly
how many billions Bill Gates has,'' says Long. ``The number's so
big, who really knows for sure? But it's somewhere in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ma Mullan wasn't amused. She decided it was time to get her
grandson to a place where he could study something other than
skipping school. A family council was convened at 7 Albion, and
Bill Mullan _ who worked two jobs, at the Boston Housing Authority
and as a part-time painter, to pay for the split-level home in
Milford where he lived with his wife and four children _ agreed to
take in a fifth.
</P>
<P>
   The Mullans considered this a chance to escape the volatile
atmosphere that had left Long's hometown under siege; Long had his
doubts. ``I tended to think in terms of the box,'' he says. ``I
thought you don't go outside the box, don't go outside that
realm.''
</P>
<P>
   But the lengths to which the Mullans were willing to go for him
made him sure of one thing: ``My uncles were great examples of
being someone your family could be proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he had a long way to go to join them, starting 40 miles
away.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Soon after that season-opening football epiphany, Bill Mullan
showed up outside the guidance office at Milford High with his
nephew. The mission: to get involved with football. To see if
athletic director and football coach Dick Corbin could use a big,
raw kid who wanted to be part of something.
</P>
<P>
   Corbin chanced upon the two in the hall. He was immediately
struck by several things. The new kid was big but quiet,
respectful. He and his uncle were refreshingly honest about the
boy's lack of football experience and scholastic inclination.
Corbin liked the way the boy made eye contact with him when he
spoke. And he admired the uncle's volunteerism in the name of
family. That was it. He took the two down to the locker room. He
would gladly give the new kid a chance, nothing more. No
expectations. No illusions. ``I certainly wasn't there because he
thought I'd lift the team's grade-point average,'' Long says.
</P>
<P>
   But that was hardly the extent of Corbin's and his wife Ruth
Ann's involvement with Long. ``I had some older kids, juniors and
seniors, who I put on him,'' says Corbin, who later became a
Harvard assistant under Joe Restic and now is Sharon High's AD,
``to give him direction and make him feel more at home.''
</P>
<P>
   And Long was deeply grateful for the attention. ``I felt like an
outsider when I went to Milford,'' he says, ``but then I met these
guys. I was fortunate to have become a member of the football team.
What the football team did for me was give me a sense of
belonging.''
</P>
<P>
   There's the other half of the equation. Maybe deep down, Long
felt out of place on the gridiron. But that uncertainty was
entirely self-generated. The people in his life _ his grandmother
and uncles, his cousins, his teammates, the Corbins, and later his
coaches in college and the pros _ displayed no such reservations.
They embraced him unequivocally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mind-boggling to think of the sacrifices that were made
in my behalf by so many people who never expected a thing,'' Long
says.
</P>
<P>
   As Ruth Ann Corbin puts it, almost incredulously: ``We never
knew he was going to be famous.''
</P>
<P>
   She says this not to exalt some noble gesture on her or anyone
else's part but merely to indicate that people helped Long because
they wanted to. He was that kind of kid _ not troubled or
troubling, just needing a little guidance. Ruth Ann, a longtime
high school English teacher at Blackstone Valley Regional, helped
provide it by tutoring Long in English and history, spending
endless hours at the Corbins' dining room table during the summer.
Dick helped provide it by nurturing Long as a player _ good enough
to help the 1975 Scarlet Hawks win the state title his junior year
_ but even more as a surrogate counselor, helping steer him away
from higher-profile, high-pressure colleges like Maryland and
Syracuse and Boston College and toward a smaller-scale atmosphere,
Villanova's, where his chance of thriving would be enhanced. And
Uncle Billy helped provide it by keeping his ward in line.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Mullan was a stickler for discipline, and certain rules
were inflexible. ``I was the only 220-pound kid in the neighborhood
who had a 9 o'clock curfew,'' says Long.
</P>
<P>
   Not that young Howie didn't push the envelope. Two of the older
players who initially guided Long and quickly befriended him, Tom
Cullen and Pat Cornelius, ``boosted him through the window some
nights,'' recalls Cullen, now the AD at Amherst High.
</P>
<P>
   Uncle Billy had his suspicions, and one night, he set a trap.
``His uncle left a stack of tires under the window,'' says Cullen,
``and Howie made all kinds of noise climbing over them.''
</P>
<P>
   Long recalls the fallout from that arrival as ``one of five life
sentences I served'' while living with his uncle. ``I was always
getting grounded for life. It was a poor man's Walpole prison.''
</P>
<P>
   The facetiousness can't mask the affection. Long is devoted to
his uncle, who, through Corbin, declined to be interviewed but told
the former Milford coach last week, ``Howie realizes how much I
loved him.''
</P>
<P>
   With no visions of some grand reward. As Cullen put it recently
when he talked to Long, ``No disrespect, Howie, but you weren't
that good a player when you started out.''
</P>
<P>
   What he was, from the inauspicious beginning, ``was just so
appreciative of anything you did for him,'' says Ruth Ann Corbin.
Like when he attended a summer football camp with the Corbins and
he'd worn out his socks halfway through his stay; Ruth Ann bought
him a dozen pair ``for $3.99 or something at Bradlees,'' and Howie
acted as if he'd just received an Armani wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   Cullen believes Long was fortunate to come under the care and
guidance of the Corbins, just as he was that other people entered
his life at opportune times.
</P>
<P>
   There was his future wife, whom he met at Villanova and who
helped tutor him there. There was Lou Ferry, his position coach
with the Wildcats and a former NFL player who told pro scouts,
``This kid is just starting to learn football. If he gets with an
organization that shows some patience, you're going to have one
great football player.'' There was Restic, then a Miford resident,
who made Long a late addition to the North squad for the Blue-Gray
college all-star game; after Long won defensive MVP honors, pro
teams belatedly began to crank up their interest. There was
Leggett, who considers Long ``like a son to me'' and promised him
as a rookie, ``If you listen to me, I'm going to make you All-Pro,
I'm going to make you a lot of money, and I'm going to put you in
the Hall of Fame.'' There were his mentors among the Raiders
veterans, such as future Hall of Fame offensive linemen Art Shell
and Gene Upshaw, who waged some bloodcurdling battles with Long in
practice. ``He was crazy,'' says Upshaw, now executive director of
the NFL Players Association. ``When I say crazy, I mean intense. He
was always willing to take advice, learn how to go after guys.
Howie figured, `We're out here _ let's go.' It didn't matter to him
if you were in pads or just your underwear; it's football `and
let's go at it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There was Millen the iconoclast, who used to scorn Villanova's
virtually imperceptible impact on the NFL but made Long an honorary
alumnus of Millen's alma mater _ Penn State _ after the Wildcats
temporarily dropped football. ``I'd prepare him for the guys he was
going to play against,'' says Millen. ``I'd say, `This guy's from
USC,' and Howie would say, `I hate him.' Or I'd say, `This guy's
from Nebraska,' and Howie would say, `I really hate him.' And then
he'd go out and destroy them.''
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, there was Long himself. And that was the main
ingredient, despite his self-deprecation. ``Howie had a lot of
influences,'' says Mike Sayles, a successful businessman who was a
senior soccer player when Long entered Milford and remains one of
his closest friends. ``A lot of them played instrumental roles in
helping him along. But Howie's the one who's responsible for where
he is today.''
</P>
<P>
   Where he is is on the doorstep of becoming the first Boston-bred
Hall of Famer. Or is it the first Milford-bred Hall of Famer?
Cullen shakes his head over the tug-of-war surrounding claims to
Long. ``This was like college for Howie,'' he says. ``He came here
for three years and did what he had to do. But his roots are in
Charlestown. I always say, `His home is in his heart.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Where he seems to have plenty of room. ``The Hall of Fame is an
individual thing,'' says Long. ``But I hope a lot of people can
take a little piece of this and feel they're in the Hall.''

BLEDSOE HAS A FEW PASSING THOUGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ Three days and counting to Miller Time and
the kickoff of the Bill Belichick era _ or at least the preseason
portion of the Belichick era.
</P>
<P>
   With Dennis Miller's Monday night opener _ New England and San
Francisco have been invited along for the festivities _ fast
approaching, Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe Thursday touched
several bases and summed up where his team is at this point in
training camp at Bryant College.
</P>
<P>
   --On exhibition games and Belichick's plan to get a good look at
quarterbacks Michael Bishop and Tom Brady Monday night and probably
again Friday at Detroit: ``I'd be happy with two preseason games.
I'd be ready to go. Five preseason games is a lot and I don't feel
I need to play all those games to be ready for the season, but
that's what we have. So I'll see a little bit of time in the first
two and then we'll pick it up for the last three.''
</P>
<P>
   --On Bishop: ``Mike's making a lot of progress. He's playing
much smarter football than he was a year ago. I think he has a much
better understanding of the offense and what's expected of him in
the passing game. I think he's really coming along.''
</P>
<P>
   --On the running game: ``You really don't know much about your
running game until you get into a game situation. But Kevin Faulk
has been running the ball very well. It looks like he's ready to
step into that role and maybe be a full-time back for us. He's
really doing a good job. We'll see.'' --On the team's
injury-wracked and makeshift offensive line that Thursday still had
second-year center Damien Woody as its most experienced player:
``They're doing well and I think Dante (Scarnecchia) is doing a
great job with them. The important thing for the young guys coming
in is to be in the right place and block the right guy, which
sounds easy but is actually an extremely complicated process. As an
offensive lineman in the league, it can be very, very complicated
to figure out who you have in the different pass protections and
different runs.''
</P>
<P>
   --On what it might be like behind that line on Monday night:
``Generally, early in the preseason you don't see a whole bunch of
looks. That should help us a little bit and then we can also
simplify things a lot with our play calls. I haven't seen the game
plan yet, but I don't anticipate coming in with seven or eight
different protections. I assume we'd just have two, three
protections where we can get somebody in front of everyone and we
should be able to do fine.''
</P>
<P>
   --On another way of looking at the patchwork line: ``You can
look at it two ways. One, yeah it is a little bit of a concern to
go into these games with a lot of untested linemen. But the flip
side of that is that you get a lot of young guys with some
experience who normally wouldn't have had it. Hopefully it will
benefit us down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   --On life ABC _ After Ben Coates: ``Those guys (tight ends Eric
Bjornson and Rod Rutledge) are playing well. They each have,
obviously, their own strengths. Rod is an excellent blocker who has
become much more proficient as a receiver. He's catching the ball
very well and he's become a much better route runner over the past
couple years. Eric is an excellent receiving tight end with good
speed and good hands and knows how to get open. He catches the ball
well but he's a little bit light (he's listed at 240 pounds to
Rutledge's 270) so we're not going to ask him to take on defensive
ends too much if we can avoid it. I think those two guys combined
should serve us well.''
</P>
<P>
   --On the offense overall: ``I think we can be explosive. I
really like the offensive scheme and I like Charlie (Weis) and his
philosophy on offense. I think we're going to be able to score
points. I don't think we have an incredible amount of depth at a
lot of positions, but if we stay healthy, I think that with this
scheme we can put up a lot of points.''

WEB FIRMS CAST WIDE NET OVER CONVENTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SAM ALLIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Political conventions, as many have noted, are cases of too many
people chasing too few stories. So when reporters find a convention
story _ any story _ fit to print, they chew on it like rottweilers.
</P>
<P>
   This year, it's The Revolutionary Impact Of Online Media On
Convention Coverage. A lot of breathless prose has been devoted to
the advent of Web cameras, interactivity and Internet skyboxes at
the Republican and Democratic powwows this summer. Speculation
abounds that the magic of wireless technology will provide an
immediacy and informality desperately needed to stem the flagging
interest of the American public in these affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But online outfits like America Online concede the hype
could dwarf the product, and their predictions remain relatively
modest. ``The conventions are important test cases for our medium
to get the coverage and tools down pat before the debates,'' says
Kathleen deLaski, AOL's director of political and governmental
programming. ``We want to demonstrate what is possible in a fully
wired world.''
</P>
<P>
   If AOL is wary of the hype, other online content providers run
for the door at the mere mention of it. They maintain that the
quality of reporting still determines bragging rights at these
affairs and that reporters will exhaust the novelty of a 360 degree
Web camera by the end of the first day and move on to their next
meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectations for online media are way too high,'' says
Jonah Goldberg, editor of the online version of The National
Review. ``We're the antibodies, not the major organs, at these
conventions. To pretend otherwise is a huge waste of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Michael Kinsley, editor of the online magazine Slate,
``We're not claiming anything novel or revolutionary about our
coverage. We'll do what we do every day _ file constantly and
casually in Internet style.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Slate nor The National Review will have skyboxes,
essential for Web casting, because they're expensive and both
organizations say that the visuals offered are as exciting as
staring at a screen-saver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Web casting is a dumb, dumb waste of resources,''
Goldberg says. ``Look at the number of people you're reaching. It's
tiny _ political junkies and reporters.''
</P>
<P>
   While the exercise is aimed primarily at these hothouse orchids,
the branding value of a skybox banner makes sense only to the few
Web concerns who can afford it, like Yahoo! and AOL.
</P>
<P>
   ``A skybox is symbolic,'' Kinsley says. ``It means you're a
grownup, and you get to hang a banner with your name on it. When
the real grownups at the networks pan their cameras around the
hall, they'll show your banner. I shudder to think what they
cost.''
</P>
<P>
   It costs, about $50,000 at Philadelphia, payable to the various
vendors who build and outfit the space, and then return it to its
original state.
</P>
<P>
   What will indisputably be new at the conventions is the
interactivity that the online media will bring to them. Users will
be able to pick and choose what they want to watch and, perhaps
more important, when. There will be endless opportunities to chat
with other users, political figures and talking heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's revolutionary is that, unlike TV or print, there are no
time or space limitations on the net,'' says Michael Bustamante,
communications director for voter.com, a political Web site that
will provide 10 interactive ``kiosks'' at key convention locations
at Philadelphia and a whopping 90 at Los Angeles. ``You can see at
3 a.m. on Thursday what happened on Monday without going through
the trash for Monday's papers.''
</P>
<P>
   The last word in convention Web cams belongs to
pseudopolitics.com, a new offshoot of pseudo.com, which bills
itself as the world's largest interactive Internet video network.
Pseudopolitics will have a handful of Web cameras to maintain a
360-degree, 24-hour sweep of the convention hall. It has provided
enough bandwidth to accommodate 100,000 viewers at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Just what viewers will witness in the middle of the night is
anyone's guess. Barring the unexpected, the scene in the small
hours should make C-Span look like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie. Jacob
Weisberg, Slate's chief political reporter, could not resist: ``The
Web cam offers an unprecedented opportunity to see what janitors
are doing at 3 a.m.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg dismisses the video quality. ``RealPlayer sucks on a
regular modem,'' he says. ``So why would you do it? Why not just
turn on your TV?''
</P>
<P>
   Because, says pseudopolitics managing editor Sam Hollander,
viewers will be able to focus on any part of the 360-degree vista
they choose when the convention is in session. ``No one else in
Philadelphia will have these,'' says Hollander about the cameras.
``It will provide a much more immersive, interactive experience.
You choose what you want to look at and listen to.''
</P>
<P>
   Viewers could, for example, isolate the Massachusetts delegation
and stare at it as long as they want _ providing they are among the
100,000 people at any one time to get access.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the television networks, which historically have declined
to pool resources, many online outfits are in cahoots to save
money. Pseudopolitics, for example, will partner with Salon.com,
George Magazine and The New York Observer for content. Each evening
of the Republican convention, Salon will broadcast an hour-long
show online from the pseudopolitics skybox.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the conventions, Yahoo! will provide updates from the
floor to its Yahoo! FinanceVision service, which offers live
coverage of the financial markets. For its video streams, it will
rely on C-Span, which is also the pool television feed for the
Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   C-Span will have 12 cameras there. Viewers will be able to
choose from one of four angles to watch the proceedings. Perhaps
the most interesting will be a view over the shoulder of C-Span
producer Gary Ellenwood, who will orchestrate all of the pool
cameras.
</P>
<P>
   AOL, which also will use C-Span for video streaming, has formed
content partnerships with CBS News, Time, The New York Times and
the Associated Press. Like all of the online media, AOL will
provide endless opportunities for members to rate speeches, endure
pundits and palaver over events as they occur.
</P>
<P>
   Slate will provide, among other things, a running conversation
between Democratic and Republican speech writers throughout the
convention. ``Half an hour after Bush's acceptance speech, there
should be four or five takes on it on Slate,'' Kinsley says.
</P>
<P>
   If he avoids the breathless, Kinsley believes nonetheless that
the conventions offer online media the chance to strut their stuff
for new audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will only be better if you believe as I do that writing
allows for more serious reflection than talking,'' he cautions.
``I'm not anticipating putting the talking heads out of business,
but if we get 10-20 percent of their audience in addition to our
own, that will be fine. But there will be no great spike for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditto for Salon, whose online eclat has been overshadowed by
recent financial woes. Kerry Lauerman, its Washington bureau chief,
maintains that those online publications with existing audiences
will fare much better than new ones who must create their own. ``We
spent a year developing our political coverage,'' he says. ``It was
baptism by fire for us in the primaries, but we established our
name.''
</P>
<P>
   Lauerman concedes online convention news would lose to a network
sitcom. ``If it's `Will and Grace' versus Liddy Dole, people will
choose `Will and Grace,' '' he says. ``But if you're at work and
you wonder what's happening at the convention, this is an appealing
option.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of online media certainly can't hurt the
conventions. Television has already killed them, Weisberg notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a huge amount of hype about the online media,'' he
says. ``On the other hand, something interesting is bound to come
out of all this. We just don't know what yet.''

HOW THE BEAT WILL GO ON, AFTER NAPSTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget Don McLean and the old war horse ``American Pie.''
Friday, July 28, will go down in history as the day the music died
_ at least for the 20 million or so users of Napster.
</P>
<P>
   In the past nine months the wildly popular music-swapping
service has become a sort of cultural glue that defines a
generation that has grown up on the Internet. That was set to end
Friday night at midnight (Pacific Daylight Time), when the court
order to shut the service down went into effect.
</P>
<P>
   So what happens next? Will some other college dropout in a
baseball cap emerge as the poster child for digital music on the
Internet? Will millions of irate Napster users migrate to other
file-sharing services, sparking another slew of lawsuits? Or will
the recording industry figure out how to woo Napster users by
marketing its products online?
</P>
<P>
   It all comes down to a simple verb. Napster defenders insist
that music needs to (itals)be(unitals) free, while record-label
execs contend that music just needs to (itals)feel(unitals) free.
And therein lies the crux of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   The folks in the ``be free'' camp include free-speech zealots,
open-source advocates, and millions of college students and
teenagers accustomed to collecting and listening to music online.
These folks will likely migrate to (and aggressively promote) other
file-sharing programs available online. The Napster chat rooms were
abuzz with options Thursday as users pointed one another to Web
sites like www.napigator.com or www.cuteMX.com and to programs like
Gnutella, Freenet, or Scour Exchange. (The founder of Napigator
said traffic to his site had tripled Thursday.)
</P>
<P>
   A user who goes by the handle Knotpine put it this way: ``We
will find new ways to download music . . . and there is no way on
earth that the music industry or anyone else can stop it.'' Others
spoke in revolutionary terms: ``We need to attack! We need to
provoke a riot!'' wrote a user called Operatorz.
</P>
<P>
   John Perry Barlow, former songwriter for the Grateful Dead and a
champion of free information online, was quick to advocate radical
action. ``I suggest massive civil disobedience,'' he wrote shortly
after the ruling came down. Thursday he said that the injunction
would create a backlash that is unstoppable _ and ultimately more
threatening to the record industry. The folks who are developing
other file-swapping programs will now work harder to create systems
that are impossible to trace. ``In that sense, (the record labels)
have created a whole new class of Hezbollah,'' he said. ``They have
radicalized the Internet community. Instead of developing networks
to address a problem, they are now doing it to make a political
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Ian Clarke, in fact, is one of those people. The 23-year-old
Irish computer engineer is the mastermind behind Freenet, a
decentralized file-sharing network that offers complete anonymity
for its users. Napster shares all of its files through a central
server that can be shut down, but Freenet creates a spiderweblike
network of computers with no central source, making it impossible
to shut down. ``The ruling is sad, and it is dangerous,'' he said
Thursday. ``It also demonstrates that when you design a network to
promote free speech, you must design it so it isn't susceptible to
the form of legal attack that Napster has seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, recording-industry executives don't agree that music
needs to be free. But while they have been lagging behind in
getting their product online, their marketing executives have
absorbed one critical lesson from Napster: Music needs to feel
free. That was the rallying cry at Plug-In, a digital music
conference in New York that ended the day before the Napster
decision. At that conference, the ``be free'' folks sparred openly
with the ``feel free'' contingent. When Elizabeth Brooks, Napster's
vice president of marketing, said, ``We absolutely respect
copyright,'' Ted Cohen, EMI's vice president of new media, snapped
back, ``How many payments have you made?''
</P>
<P>
   But Cohen, an industry veteran, also said that he would be
willing to work with Napster under the right circumstances. That's
where the ``feel free'' notion comes in. All of the major record
companies and scores of Internet start-up companies are struggling
to develop online music services that make money but seem free to
consumers. Ultimately, these services will enable users to listen
to digital music not only on their computers, but also on stereos,
portable players, and even cell phones. Some, like EMI, are
planning to launch music-subscription services, which, like cable
television, seem free to users who simply turn on the switch
whenever they feel like it. The Internet company eMusic, in fact,
launched a subscription service this week; it has gained licenses
from scores of independent labels whose music is featured on the
service.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, musicbank, a San Francisco-based start-up, has been
negotiating licensing deals with the major record companies to
offer a service that will enable users to store music they own in
an online locker that they can access from any computer hooked up
to the Internet. This week, it signed a deal with Universal Music
Group, the major record label that is widely viewed as the least
likely to work with Internet start-ups and the most protective of
its music catalog. Users won't pay a dime for musicbank's service,
which is set to launch in September. The service will support
itself with advertisements; like radio, it simply feels free.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first to sign agreements with all the labels will be well
ahead of the pack,'' said musicbank cofounder Pierce Ledbetter.
</P>
<P>
   And so the race is on to become the It brand in the post-Napster
era. A company called Click Radio offers a personalized Net radio
service that enables users to customize their song lists. Its
source of revenue: advertising. Another new company, called
Gigabeat, just launched a music portal that suggests music to its
users. Ditto for Music Buddha, which offers a music-recommendation
service.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these start-ups were founded by young engineers who seem
similar to Napster founder Shawn Fanning. The difference is that
they are not openly defying the music industry. And they're all
trying to capitalize on the Napster ruling by touting their
companies as ``legal alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the major labels are trying to figure out how to use
the idea of Napster and make money at the same time. One idea
encourages music sharing as a kind of viral marketing scheme. For
instance, one user buys a digital version of an album and then
sends it to a friend. That friend has two days to decide whether to
buy the music before it expires. In addition, the labels are also
quietly exploring ways to launch Napster-like sharing services that
make money via advertising or subscription fees.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the Napster revolution? Isn't part of its appeal
based in its underground status? ``It's like any revolution,'' said
Talal Shaloom, senior vice president of media at the Internet
security company InterTrust. ``The revolutionaries never get to see
the promised land.''
</P>
<P>
   That very notion infuriates the folks who started the movement
and who are now more determined than ever that music must be free.
``You cannot kill it,'' said Barlow.
</P>
<P>
   But many observers think that it will be business as usual in
the recording industry once the dust has settled around the Napster
case. The powers that be in the entertainment industry, after all,
can just keep suing and suing and suing while they buy time to
develop their own digital delivery systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you combat a black market?'' asked Shaloom. ``You don't
go after the pirateers. You compete. You create value.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the ``feel free'' folks are beating the ``be free''
folks, at least in the courts. Meanwhile, the developers of
alternative systems are vowing to keep the music flowing. That
tension has yet to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before the decision, Napster CEO Hank Barry was asked
what would happen if his company lost the case. ``Maybe we'd have
the Napster memorial site,'' he said, without smiling. It doesn't
look like anyone will need it. One way or the other, digital music
will be available online.

DIDO GIVES THANKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Career boosts can come from unexpected sources. Try this one: A
new English singer named Dido suddenly gets a package in the mail
from chart-topping rapper Eminem. It's a copy of Eminem's song,
``Stan,'' complete with an added sample of Dido's voice lifted from
her tune, ``Thank You.'' Eminem asks permission to use the sample
and she says yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know the real story of how he got a hold of the
record,'' says Dido. ``The story I got is that (Eminem and his
management) heard it on TV and sampled it. Then they sent me a copy
of their song and I loved it. I thought it was great. I love the
way they made a sweet song about, basically, a psycho-obsessional
fan.''
</P>
<P>
   That description is putting it mildly. The song ``Stan'' is
about a male groupie who goes nuts because the protagonist, Slim
Shady, won't see him or send an autograph. So the fan drives off a
bridge, killing himself and his pregnant wife. The song is now a
hit on rock radio, though its subject matter has forced Dido to
answer some tough questions about why she would give permission to
sample her voice on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, some people have accused me of being homophobic and
misogynistic,'' she says. ``But I tell them, `Wait a minute. Let's
back up here. Just because someone sampled my track doesn't mean
that I'm a horrific character.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Eminem's album. I think he's a great entertainer. Yes,
he's out to shock, but that's his thing.''
</P>
<P>
   So who exactly is Dido (pronounced DYE-doe)?
</P>
<P>
   She's a former literary agent who grew up in London right around
the corner from pop-soul singer Sade (one of her early influences)
and is now 28. She was given the name Dido by her mother, who loved
classical literature. Dido is a queen in Virgil's ``Aeneid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a name that people typically call their children.
It's a pretty cruel thing to do, I'd say,'' notes Dido. ``I took
some bullying when I was younger because of the name, but you know,
you have to fight to counteract such things and that was actually
good for me.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also a great show-business name, because people certainly
remember it. ``My mother says, `You have a nice name now, don't
you?' '' Dido says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, Dido was singing for fun, but spending most of
her time at her day job and working nights to get a law degree.
``But I burned out,'' she says. ``So I finally said, `Let me try
doing music.' ''
</P>
<P>
   She was in a band called Faithless, then opted to go solo, which
led to some dates on the Lilith Fair tour and to her solo CD, ``No
Angel,'' an instantly likable, ambient-pop record that includes the
sampled tune ``Thank You.'' It's a love song addressed to a
boyfriend (``Darling, I want to thank you for giving me the best
day of my life'') and is one of many personal songs on the CD.
Other songs express self-determination, plus the will to go on
after a romantic loss, self-acceptance (the song ``Honestly Ok'')
and a tune from which the CD title was taken, ``I'm No Angel,''
with the verse, ``I'm no angel, but please don't think I can't
cry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote that song as an apology to my boyfriend,'' she says.
``The whole point of the album is being human and not being afraid
to make mistakes, never regretting what you've done, and learning
from your mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Dido has a beautiful voice that has been compared to those of
Beth Orton and Sarah McLachlan. ``Beth Orton is on my same label,
but she's more of a folkie than I am,'' says Dido. ``As for Sarah,
I never heard her stuff before I came over to America, but when I
heard her at Lilith, I was blown away. I don't mind being compared
to people, as long as they are people that I like. These people are
great singers and I buy their albums.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was making my album, I was into Wiliam Orbit, Massive
Attack, and Portishead,'' adds Dido. ``And when I was younger, I
was really into the Police.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of Dido's songs were written on guitar and piano, but a
couple are written around loops provided by Pascal Gabriel from
Belgium, who appears on the album credits as P. Gabriel. That has
made some people wonder if that stood for Peter Gabriel, but Dido
says, ``I wish!''
</P>
<P>
   The way she's going right now, Peter Gabriel and the rest of the
music world will know about her soon enough.
</P>

   Godsmack moves up in Ozzfest: Boston's Godsmack has just gone
triple platinum (3 million sold) with its self-titled debut album,
which keeps spawning hits. Godsmack has also moved up the pecking
order for Ozzfest. Godsmack plays third to last, followed only by
Pantera and the man himself, Ozzy Osbourne. ``It's all good,''
Godsmack singer Sully Erna says from the road, ``though I must
admit we're kind of burnt out.''
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense that Godsmack is somewhat fried after being on
the road almost continuously for the past two years. ``But we'll
get a break after Ozzfest,'' Erna says. ``I plan to just sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Erna adds that it has been a real thrill to be followed at
Ozzfest by Pantera. ``They're the kings. There is no heavier band
than Pantera,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Godsmack was to have issued its second album later this summer,
but the release date has been pushed to Halloween. There's no title
yet for the album, though. ``We're still working that out,'' says
Erna.

 &HT;    CAN'T SETTLE JERUSALEM? LEAVE IT IN GOD'S HANDS

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ When low-level negotiators can't settle a dispute,
they usually ``bump it upstairs'' for a decision.
</P>
<P>
   So, why not turn to The Man Upstairs(CQ) to settle the dispute
over the holy city of Jerusalem?
</P>
<P>
   Some Israeli academics suggest Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators break their deadlock over the city by giving God
sovereignty over the most sacred _ and disputed _ areas.
</P>
<P>
   It's an idea that Jordan's late King Hussein repeatedly
advocated. The intent is to break the stalemate on a largely
symbolic issue with a symbolic solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful idea,'' said Ruth Lapidoth, one of several
scholars who advise Israeli negotiators. ``Sovereignty is an
abstract notion that makes people's feelings very strong. It's a
symbolic notion that makes it very difficult to compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the issue of sovereignty, which means ``supreme
power,'' in Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary, should be set
aside for 20 or 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that time, either you say sovereignty belongs to God or you
say each side shares sovereignty,'' said Lapidoth, who is a law
professor at Jerusalem's Hebrew University and a researcher at the
Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem was the biggest snag in the recently failed, 15-day,
Camp David summit. Negotiators announced Thursday that they would
start low-level meetings in the region on Sunday and the talks are
sure to turn to the city once again.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has controlled the entire city since capturing its
eastern areas in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
</P>
<P>
   Most agree that sovereignty has little impact on daily life.
Israeli negotiators, in broad terms, already appear willing to give
Palestinians near-total control their own neighborhoods. There are
a number of ideas, including joint police forces or a city borough
system, that could lead to practical solutions.
</P>
<P>
   But, Israelis refuse to cede sovereignty, and Palestinians won't
take a deal without it.
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion to hand sovereignty to God was noted Thursday in
Israel's Ha'aretz daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   But, Palestinian spokeswoman Hanan Ashrawi Friday said the
dispute should be settled through more ``terrestrial'' ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of sovereignty belonging to God is very hard to
define. I mean, who will issue visas?'' she said. ``Abstract powers
sometimes have a hard time organizing lights and garbage collection
and transportation. It will be better to have a human agreement,
and I'm sure God will approve.''

GOP IS ALL GEARED UP AND ROLLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA -- They are carrying things to great heights here
at the GOP convention, and nobody's taking things higher than Ed
Castor.
</P>
<P>
   He's the crane operator working a $1 million German-made Krupp
boom crane who lifted the letters on the signature sign. Every
network telecast here will typically open with a shot of the
``Comcast, Proud Host, Republican Convention'' at the First Union
center. That is, if Castor gets the spelling right and doesn't mix
up his letters dangling one at a time from the tip of his 170-foot
long fishing rod.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can put 300 feet on that,'' said Castor matter-of-factly
Wednesday as his ``jib'' on the end of the boom wafted back and
forth in winds gusting up to 40 mph. ``I just took a section out
that had it out 200 feet.'' So who's in charge of spelling the
words right, I asked some rain-coated ground supervisors? ``Him!''
they said, pointing to Ed.
</P>
<P>
   But the man in charge of the whole shebang is Andy Card, the
former Massachusetts legislator who is running the convention for
Bush &AMP; Bush Inc., the family dynasty that is set to nominate their
second president in 12 years. Card, a longtime associate of the
clan, represents the auto industry in D.C. when he's not helping
Bushes run for president. And he's thrilled with Governor George W.
Bush's selection of Dick Cheney as running mate. ``When they asked
me to take this job,'' said Card in a brief interview, ``the first
person I called was Cheney,'' to ask him what he thought.'' The
quintessential insider's insider, Cheney's selection is a
reassuring development to a lot of party officials.
</P>
<P>
   There are hundreds of GOP insiders who made it a point to
inquire ``What does Cheney think?'' over the past 25 years,
covering the span the VP designee ran Gerald Ford's White House
staff, joined the GOP leadership during a decade as Wyoming's lone
congressman, and ran the Defense Department for Bush Sr. in the
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   There's another Bay Stater _ an adopted one _ who is Card's
official convention spokeswoman: Leslie Goodman, a veteran party
operative from New York and California, has been hanging her
chapeau at Harvard's Kennedy School for several seasons. ``I've
been here for two-and-a-half months,'' she said during one media
stop, cell phone in one ear, and two staff aides whispering into
another, and a smart suede shoulder bag stuffed with bumpf hanging
off one shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Hers is a maddening chore; there are 15,000 media types
descending upon the City of Brotherly Love, and Goodman is supposed
to have the answers they demand. It is Card who presides over the
daily media feeding, and he's promising to deliver a convention
``very different from what you have seen in the past . . . it will
all be different.''
</P>
<P>
   Card's self-assurance reflects the confidence of the Bush
campaign: they seem to think they have this election won, if they
just don't blow it. The poll numbers shift a little here and there,
but no poll has had Al Gore up, all year so far, and Bush is ahead
in a lot more states. The choice of Cheney is reassuring to a lot
of Republicans who didn't want any nasty surprises.
</P>
<P>
   One exploitable issue will be abortion _ Cheney and Bush are
both prolife. Another distant cloud on the horizon is gasoline
prices; Bush and Cheney were both oil company bosses in Texas. But
it is impossible to find a Republican here who deems Bush-Cheney a
losing ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are selecting the next president and vice president of this
country here, and the party knows that,'' Card said. Veteran (car)
marketer that he is, Card has a slogan, ``the four P's,'' to
delineate themes of the convention broadcasts opening Monday night:
``Principles, people, partnerships, and picking-a-president.''
That's five ``P's'' by my count, but Andy throws in more: ``this is
not about a party, it's about picking a president.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans had a ``16-day program rollout'' script and are
following it. GOP conclaves are always tightly scripted and
masterfully buttoned-down. This may be the most-scripted and
best-buttoned-down. The potentially divisive issue of excising
antiabortion language from the platform has been squashed. The GOP
Platform Committee will do its work off-site, meeting through
Saturday. Prochoice Republicans have been informed there will be no
tinkering with the antiabortion platform language.
</P>
<P>
   Opening night is heavy on the ``compassion'' theme'' with worthy
teachers, pastors, and adoption experts, sprinkled among
``compassion videos.'' These are unusual topics for convention
prime time, but Card justifies the scheme as showing ``how the
country is involved in leaving no child behind.'' That sounds
suspiciously like Hillary's ``It Takes a Village to Raise a Child''
book, but no one here encourages that kind of thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night is wall-to-wall patriotism, with Vietnam vets and
General Stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf remote-casting from the
battleship New Jersey. John McCain will wind it up with a 20-minute
speech that will be closely watched for degree of warmth toward
Bush, who roughed him up plenty during primary skirmishes.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP brass thought of everything, down to harnessing the
hot-air power of volunteers who began blowing up 150,000 balloons
for the big drop at the conclusion of Bush's acceptance speech. The
party's PR plans took a hit with the Concorde plane crash stepping
on Bush's selection of Cheney. But otherwise, to the extent
possible, this party is geared up, buttoned-down, and rolling as
planned to what the participants honestly anticipate will be a
glorious victory in November.

AS NORTEL NETWORKS RACES ON, LUCENT STRUGGLES TO CATCH UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It turns out you can teach some old dogs new tricks. And in the
new economy, the dog that learns the new tricks gets the bone; the
one that doesn't gets treated like a dog on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Two old dogs _ Nortel Networks and Lucent Technologies _
reported their earnings this week. Both companies have been around
for a while, albeit under different names, and both have become
behemoths selling equipment to the world's big telephone carriers.
</P>
<P>
   But that is where the similarities end. Lucent reported
disappointing earnings and warned that it would struggle for the
next two quarters at least. Nortel had terrific earnings and
promised more of the same for the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel stock is up almost fivefold since the beginning of 1999
and now commands a market value of $235 billion. Lucent's stock is
down 40 percent from its 1999 high; its market value is $156
billion, even though its sales are greater.
</P>
<P>
   Why the divergence? The simple answer is that Nortel figured out
which way the world was heading and got their first. Lucent started
late and hasn't yet found a way to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   The race between the two giants is of more than passing
interest. Lucent has a large work force in Massachusetts and just
this week spent $1.3 billion to acquire Spring Tide Networks, a
Maynard, Mass. start-up. Nortel this week said it wanted to hire
1,800 people to work at its Massachusetts facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The telecom business is facing what Harvard Business School
professor Clayton Christensen calls ``disruptive change.'' The rise
of the Internet and the demand for systems that can carry data as
well as voice has created a need for a whole new generation of
telecommunications gear.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional voice equipment that Lucent and Nortel make has
become a mature market. The action has shifted to the new stuff _
fiber-optic products.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel recognized that tilt in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became really clear that we needed to make a big shift and
I mean big shift,'' chief executive John Roth explained in an
interview with the Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel's radar may have been keener because some of its
customers were the newer, more forward-thinking carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys were building networks from the ground up and they
wanted the latest and greatest stuff,'' said Richard Crable, an
analyst with Loomis Sayles.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent, by contrast, sold mainly to the established carriers,
AT&AMP;T and the Baby Bells, and that group anticipated a much slower
transition to the new world.
</P>
<P>
   In this case the future came sooner rather than later and Nortel
was ready for it. In the most recent quarter Nortel sold an
estimated $1.5 billion to $2 billion worth of new-generation gear,
according to Crable. Lucent sales of comparable products was only
$192 million.
</P>
<P>
   But anticipation is only half the battle. The other half is
execution. Here, too, differences have emerged between the two
rivals. Both companies have relied on acquisitions to speed their
entrance into new markets.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel spent $7 billion to buy Bay Networks of California two
years ago. Soon after Lucent spent $20 billion to buy Ascend
Communications, a California company that previously had acquired
Cascade Communications, a hot Massachusetts firm.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Nortel has successfully integrated Bay. The
integration of Ascend has not gone as smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have bailed out of Ascend like men going overboard,''
said Howard Anderson, senior managing director of YankeeTek
Ventures in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those bailing out started their own telecom companies,
becoming Lucent rivals in the process.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999 Lucent paid $900 million for Nexabit Networks, a
Marlborough, Mass. company that was developing a new-generation
router.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nexabit router was widely perceived to be a neat product
but we haven't seen any volume shipment yet,'' said Andrew Cray, an
analyst with the Aberdeen Group in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Recently Nexabit's founder left Lucent and set up a competing
firm across the street.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel and Lucent have plenty of company in the telecom
business. A host of young pups, including Sycamore Networks in
Massachusetts and Juniper Networks in Silicon Valley, are
challenging the old dogs. A group of European gear makers are
trying to sell into the same market.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, Nortel is well-positioned in the race to the
future. Asked what would have happened to his company had it not
moved quickly enough, Nortel's Roth told the Journal: ``We would
have looked like some our competitors . . . not as interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Take that Lucent.

<P>
   McLEAN, Va. _ It can be a tricky business, trying to export a
New England retail icon south _ just ask Filene's Basement, whose
drawing power seemed to wane beyond area code 617.
</P>
<P>
   So, in opening its first full-price store outside of Maine this
week, L. L. Bean Inc. is taking no chances.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the new store is crucial to a plan for boosting flat
sales by winning over new customers who live in faraway places
where L. L. Bean lore and legend are less familiar.
</P>
<P>
   To instantly acclimate outlanders to a tradition that began in
1912, the new store seeks to recreate a bit of Freeport, Maine, in
a most unMainelike shopping mall near Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   No expense has been spared. At this retail shrine to the
duckboot and the kayak, there's an indoor waterfall, a trout pond,
and a climbing wall for children _ though the store will not be
open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year ``to accommodate,'' as company
founder Leon Leonwood Bean once said, ``sportsmen who appear at the
store at any hour of the day or night, en route to their favorite
fishing hole or hunting ground,'' a la Freeport.
</P>
<P>
   As a grandson of L. L., president Leon A. Gorman knows there can
be a downside to the venerable past.
</P>
<P>
   If his company is to move forward, he believes, it must dispel
the widely held view that L. L. Bean mostly sells old-fashioned
gear for surviving New England winters.
</P>
<P>
   Gorman said of consumers: ``They know us a little differently
than the way we want them to know us.''
</P>
<P>
   To regain the momentum it enjoyed when preppy fashions had their
heyday, the company must convince folks who don't care about the
Red Sox or the color of their chowder that L. L. Bean is a
contemporary retailer for all seasons and a merchant for all
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the new store fits in. Think of it as a missionary
outpost in a foreign country. In part, the store's job is to create
awareness and spread the gospel as L. L. Bean seeks converts in
geographies far beyond the Connecticut River.
</P>
<P>
   Let folks from mid-Atlantic states see the store and feel the
merchandise; let them experience firsthand the mystique of quality
and service, and over time, they'll become as loyal to L. L. Bean
as someone from Bangor, Berwick, or Bar Harbor. Kate Stevenson,
associate director of the National Park Service, cut the ribbon; 5
percent of sales from the grand opening weekend will be donated to
the National Park Foundation, which helps support the national
parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came down here for business-growth reasons, but also for
brand-building reasons, and the latter may be more important,''
Gorman said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few years, Gorman plans to open three to five
stores in states such as Maryland and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will tell us if the Bean concept is exportable,'' Gorman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Add new stores to the mix, and Gorman thinks they'll improve
catalog and Web site sales as well. If all goes according to plan,
privately held L. L. Bean aims to reach $1.3 billion in annual
sales within a few years.
</P>
<P>
   That would be about 30 percent higher than 1999 sales of $1.06
billion, up from $1.03 billion in 1998. Catalog sales accounted for
78 percent of the total; Internet sales for 9 percent. Besides its
famous store in Freeport, the company operates 12 outlet stores.
</P>
<P>
   New stores offer another advantage. A big chunk of L. L. Bean's
catalog business comes during the holidays. New stores should help
L. L. Bean become more of a 12-month business.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, exporting L. L. Bean's magic south wouldn't
seem much of a challenge. After all, if something has thrived in
Maine, why shouldn't it work somewhere else?
</P>
<P>
   Not all New England retail legends have traveled well.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, Filene's Basement has been beloved by generations of
locals. Yet when it opened satellite stores outside its home turf,
it eventually ran into trouble, winding up in Chapter 11.
</P>
<P>
   While there are many complex reasons why Filene's Basement was
recently acquired by an Ohio department-store chain, there is also
a simple one: To a Bostonian, Filene's Basement will always be
unique. But to consumers visiting the chain's outposts in Minnesota
or Illinois, Filene's Basement was just another store.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say expansion can't work. One local retailer that
has had success beyond New England is Legal Sea Foods Inc., which
operates about half of its 21 restaurants outside the region.
</P>
<P>
   As it roamed far from the Hub, Legal Sea Foods had to make
changes, adding more crab dishes and cream sauces to its menu to
keep new customers happy in Baltimore and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't take an exact template from one area and replicate
it in another,'' said Legal Sea Food chief executive Roger
Berkowitz.
</P>
<P>
   Hhow L. L. Bean fares beyond New England is anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the moment for expansion may not be the most
auspicious. Like many apparel retailers, including Lands' End Inc.
and Eddie Bauer, L. L. Bean has seen soft sales recently.
</P>
<P>
   According to catalog-industry consultant Maxwell Sroge, clothing
trends seem to be working against some catalogers.
</P>
<P>
   ``L. L. Bean and Lands' End are not exactly at the cutting edge
of fashion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Opening new stores is only part of a strategy to boost sales.
Fashion figures into it too. Last year, L. L. Bean launched a
women's career-wear line called Freeport Studio that aims beyond
the sensible-shoe crowd. While early results did not meet
optimistic expectations, recent sales have improved, Gorman said.
</P>
<P>
   L. L. Bean also looked for a lift from an ad campaign with the
message, ``Start here, go anywhere.'' But L. L. Bean and its ad
agency, Mullen of Wenham, recently parted ways.
</P>
<P>
   Such issues aside, the opening of new stores could put
88-year-old L. L. Bean at the forefront of 21st-century retail.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, the conventional wisdom held that retailers
that sold goods only online would persuade busy consumers to
abandon brick-and-mortar stores for Internet convenience.
</P>
<P>
   But stocking warehouses, shipping orders, and handling returns _
something L. L. Bean and Lands' End have excelled at for years _
proved too much for many Internet upstarts.
</P>
<P>
   Now the revisionist thinking is that the shrewd retailer of the
21st century will employ a ``brick-and-click'' strategy, one that
lets consumers choose how they want to buy goods _ at a store, on
the Web, or through a catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Under this formula, each channel reinforces the other two. A
store makes many consumers feel more comfortable about buying goods
from the retailer's Web site. And some consumers like referring to
a catalog as they make purchases from a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It creates all sorts of synergies,'' Sroge said of this
approach. ``The catalog promotes the brand, and the store promotes
the Web site. It's like a retail triple play.''

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ When low-level negotiators can't settle a dispute,
they usually ``bump it upstairs'' for a decision.
</P>
<P>
   So, why not turn to The Man Upstairs(CQ) to settle the dispute
over the holy city of Jerusalem?
</P>
<P>
   Some Israeli academics suggest Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators break their deadlock over the city by giving God
sovereignty over the most sacred _ and disputed _ areas.
</P>
<P>
   It's an idea that Jordan's late King Hussein repeatedly
advocated. The intent is to break the stalemate on a largely
symbolic issue with a symbolic solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful idea,'' said Ruth Lapidoth, one of several
scholars who advise Israeli negotiators. ``Sovereignty is an
abstract notion that makes people's feelings very strong. It's a
symbolic notion that makes it very difficult to compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the issue of sovereignty, which means ``supreme
power,'' in Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary, should be set
aside for 20 or 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that time, either you say sovereignty belongs to God or you
say each side shares sovereignty,'' said Lapidoth, who is a law
professor at Jerusalem's Hebrew University and a researcher at the
Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem was the biggest snag in the recently failed, 15-day,
Camp David summit. Negotiators announced Thursday that they would
start low-level meetings in the region on Sunday and the talks are
sure to turn to the city once again.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has controlled the entire city since capturing its
eastern areas in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
</P>
<P>
   Most agree that sovereignty has little impact on daily life.
Israeli negotiators, in broad terms, already appear willing to give
Palestinians near-total control their own neighborhoods. There are
a number of ideas, including joint police forces or a city borough
system, that could lead to practical solutions.
</P>
<P>
   But, Israelis refuse to cede sovereignty, and Palestinians won't
take a deal without it.
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion to hand sovereignty to God was noted Thursday in
Israel's Ha'aretz daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   But, Palestinian spokeswoman Hanan Ashrawi Friday said the
dispute should be settled through more ``terrestrial'' ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of sovereignty belonging to God is very hard to
define. I mean, who will issue visas?'' she said. ``Abstract powers
sometimes have a hard time organizing lights and garbage collection
and transportation. It will be better to have a human agreement,
and I'm sure God will approve.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Andy Pike, 29, a Boston investment banker, wants it every
morning, but it's now a sort of forbidden pleasure. He didn't even
realize how much he liked it, that feeling of power it bestowed,
until he had to stop doing it just to fit in around the office.
</P>
<P>
   Pike wants to wear a suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a uniform,'' said Pike, whose firm approved casual day
everyday this summer for the first time. ``You just get up in the
morning and grab a suit. When you're in a meeting with older men,
the suit makes you feel more like an equal.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray-haired traditionalists aren't the only ones balking as
corporate America leaps onto the Casual-Day bandwagon. Resisters of
this trend now encompass a broad cross-section of workers,
including younger men and minorities scratching to make their first
big marks in their careers. Some complain that their Polo shirts
and Gap khakis invite questions about how to fix the copy machine
jam or mail an express package.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still more accustomed to wearing a suit than not wearing
one,'' said Ed Colbert, a Boston attorney in his early 30s whose
firm, Looney and Grossman, is intensely debating whether to extend
five-day casual day beyond this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Men have clearly struggled more with casual day than women, who
have never stuck to a corporate uniform and who have a wider
selection when it comes to choosing attire. Psychologists say many
men, to some degree, see casual day as yet another arena where they
have to compete. Indeed the jungle of casual fashion requires a
mix-and-match ability and a fashion sense that many men say they
don't possess.
</P>
<P>
   ``When everyone wears the same suit, there's less competition,''
said clinical psychologist Jerrold Lee Shapiro, adding that men's
suits can be thought of like competition-reducing school uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Some employers and workers say they don't like the way
dress-down day has turned into leisure day, affecting not only
attire but behavior. They aren't surprised by a national study this
year showing that 44 percent of firms that allow casual dress at
least one day a week, saw an increase in tardiness and absenteeim
among staff. Flirtatious behavior went up in 30 percent at these
firms, according to the study by Jackson Lewis, a New York
employment law firm.
</P>
<P>
   While clearly an overwhelming majority of workers see casual
dress policies as a popular job perk, a small but increasingly
vocal group dismiss it as a mere passing fad.
</P>
<P>
   They say these policies are naively supported by young
professionals who never had to scramble to win new clients, even if
only marginally through the image of suits and ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``They take it for granted that they're a genius because they
get paid so much,'' said John Dineen, 72, a partner at Peabody and
Arnold. ``They don't remember the hard times when you had to hustle
for business.''
</P>
<P>
   While some men's retailers hope to revive the suit this fall
with dress-up Thursdays, many workers see no way to reverse the
casualization of work attire. Consider that in 1992, 24 percent of
American companies offered at least one day of casual dress. Last
year, about 95 percent of companies had some kind of casual day
policy, according to the Society for Human Resource Management, a
trade group for personnel managers.
</P>
<P>
   While this same group reports a slight dip for this year _ 87
percent permit at least one day of casual attire _ it remains to be
seen if this is a part of a real backlash or a blip in the trend
that began when Silicon Valley high-tech entrepreneurs went to work
in jeans and T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   That level of informality, however, isn't the acceptable
``business casual'' as defined by most companies. In fact, many
companies that find casualness has gone too far have issued memos
that clearly ban such things as halter tops, stretch pants, jeans
and shirts without collars.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, the every day casual day movement took off last fall
after one of city's biggest law firms, Hale and Dorr, announced its
lawyers would no longer be required to wear suits.
</P>
<P>
   As casual clothes have spread from Fridays to all days and
summers only to every month, some people complain of a new fashion
facism. Donning a suit _ when you aren't seeing a client or
attending a formal meeting _ can project the image of being stuck
in the past or shamelessly seeking the approval of the firm's
old-liners.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some internal pressure to conform and not wear a
suit,'' said a Hale &AMP; Dorr law associate in his 30s who asked that
his name not be revealed. ``If you wear a suit, people ask, `Did
you go to court today?' or `What did you do that was so important?'
''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Olohan, 30, an associate at the law firm, Nutter, McClennen
and Fish, said he likes the suit-and-tie uniform for lawyers, and
doesn't understand why the legal profession is copying the attire
of high-tech geeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good thing we don't depend on first-degree murder
defendants as our clients,'' he said. ``We'd all be wearing orange
jump suits.''
</P>
<P>
   What to wear to work carries a particular significance for
minority professionals, said Monroe ``Bud'' Moseley, vice president
of a Boston executive-search firm. While informal dress can lead to
a less stratified work environment, a plus for many minorities, it
can also be ``an additional opportunity'' to diminish the status of
minority professionals, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Golden Hebsgaard, executive director of the Boston Law
Firm Group, which advocates for more minority recruitment at law
firms, said, ``Casual day standards may not be the same'' for
minority workers. She advises young minority attorneys to stay on
the conservative side of ``business casual,'' which means
well-pressed slacks and collared shirts.
</P>
<P>
   A 34-year-old attorney at one of Boston's largest firms, who is
African-American, gave the sobering observation that even when he's
dressed in a suit, he is often mistaken for working as a paralegal
or a member of the support staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think, `He's black, he's can't be a lawyer,'' said this
attorney, who asked to remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Boston College sociologist Charles Derber said he thinks anxiety
about casual business dress also reflects a persistent insecurity
among today's workers, even in a good economy, about just where
they stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in this boom period, workers are struggling with the
rapidly changing work environment,'' he said. ``Maybe people are
looking for some trappings of order.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston venture capitalist Bill Collatos predicted that the end
of the boom, a recession, will ultimately be what rains on the
dress-down day parade. Though he enjoys the benefits of casual
attire, he always hears his father's saying, ``A tie is the
cheapest form of dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that people remember the attire of two men _ Steve
Case, chairman of America Online, and Gerald Levin, chairman of
Time Warner _ during their momentous press conference in January
when AOL bought Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Case was wearing a tie, and Levin had on only a shirt,''
Collatos said. ``And remember who was buying whom.''

change that, however, joining the boards of seven corporations and
investing in some of those firms. He also went to work as a
consultant for Philip Morris, the largest cigarette manufacturer
and one of the companies paying the state $4.8 billion to settle a
lawsuit that Miller filed. Now that he has been appointed to the

   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ More than 10 years ago I test
drove a 12-cylinder BMW that cost more than my house. One of the
features packed into this luxury high-performance car was a
hands-free telephone. The phone wasn't hooked up, but I was told
that the voices of the driver and passengers were picked up clearly
by a built-in microphone. The person on the other end of the
conversation was heard through the car's excellent speaker system,
which automatically muted other signals going to the speakers when
the phone was in use. I considered this a nifty development.

   MINTER-COLUMN _ FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ ATLANTA _ The notion that
some things never change has gone out the window in the 21st
century. Everything changes. If you don't believe it, look what's
happening in the Army, the Navy, the Air Force and even in the
Marines. According to a story in USA Today, basic training has gone
to what amounts to social promotions in public schools. Everybody
graduates. The new Army is bending over backward to help sad-sack
trainees. Instead of being thrown to the mercy of tough old
sergeants, recruits who arrive too soft and flabby for regular
training get an easier course. The nervous and fearful get
counseling to calm them down. (Jim Minter is a former editor of The

REPUBLICAN TICKET LETS A MILITARY CONNECTION SLIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WALTER V. ROBINSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Republican Party, through 12 straight presidential
elections, from Eisenhower in 1952 until Dole in 1996, matched its
muscular approach to national defense by fielding candidates who
had served in wartime.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the service was heroic, as with Robert Dole. Sometimes
it was mundane, as with Ronald Reagan's three years stateside with
the US Army and Army Air Corps during World War II. Still, they
served.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 GOP ticket has only the slightest connection to that
long gray line. The question is: Will voters care?
</P>
<P>
   During the Vietnam War, Texas Governor George W. Bush compiled a
spotty attendance record in a Texas Air National Guard billet
arranged through family political connections. And this week, he
chose a running mate, Dick Cheney, whose extended student life _
and the fortuitous conception of his first child _ insulated him
from any military service during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   With Second World War and Korean War veterans dying by the
thousands every day, and the Cold War itself just a distant memory,
the notion of military service as an invaluable part of a political
resume may be passing into history just as quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in picking Cheney as his running mate, Bush passed over
two decorated Vietnam veterans, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge and
Nebraska Senator Chuck Hagel _ even though his general election
oppponent, Vice President Al Gore, spent five months in Vietnam and
might yet ask someone like Senator John F. Kerry, a decorated
Vietnam veteran, to join him on the Democratic ticket.
</P>
<P>
   As political strategists in both parties mulled over the Cheney
choice Thursday, they saw little risk in Bush's move: After all, in
1992, Bill Clinton, who actively avoided service during the Vietnam
War, took the White House away from President Bush, who was the
Navy's youngest pilot during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   William D. McInturff, a Republican poll taker who worked earlier
this year for Senator John McCain, said a Vietnam War credential
retains potential for drawing voters. But, McInturff said, ``Bill
Clinton changed the equation. If he could dodge the draft and be
elected president, it will be hard for the Democrats to say that
Governor Bush's National Guard service or Dick Cheney's deferments
are disqualifying.''
</P>
<P>
   By his reckoning, and that of California-based Democratic
strategist William A. Carrick, the bulk of the electorate is now
concentrated in two generations for whom military service has
become increasingly rare.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics maintained by the Selective Service System and the
Department of Veterans Affairs suggest that Bush and Cheney are
more typical of the Vietnam-era generation than, say, Gore and
Kerry. And very few voters under age 45 have served in the military
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Between July 1, 1964 and June 30, 1973, just before Bush won an
early release from the National Guard to attend Harvard Business
School, 18.3 million men registered with Selective Service. Just
8.8 million of them, including 1.7 million draftees, served on
active duty. And of those who served on active duty, just 2.6
million served in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   As of mid-1966, when Cheney's daughter was born, there were more
draft-age fathers deferred from service, 3.5 million, than the
total number of men and women who served in Vietnam throughout the
war.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, McInturff and Carrick both pointed to evidence that the
military credential still draws votes. And McInturff, like
Democrats who see partisan advantage in Cheney's selection, said
Gore's military experience might appeal to a class of voters who
are dependable GOP voters _ older white voters in Midwestern swing
states who normally vote Republican.
</P>
<P>
   For now, at least, Bush holds an overwhelming edge among such
voters, many of whom are veterans, polls show. It is for that
reason, McInturff said, that it is important that Bush counter any
impression that he received preferential treatment in the National
Guard. The Cheney choice may help, he said, because Cheney served
as defense secretary under Bush's father.
</P>
<P>
   But making the case against preferential treatment may be hard.
There is strong evidence that in 1968, the son of George H.W. Bush,
then a Houston congressman, was vaulted to the top of a long
waiting list because a friend of the elder Bush made a call to
Texas House Speaker Ben Barnes, who often helped place the sons of
political allies in the Texas Guard. Both Bushes have denied any
knowledge of the intercession.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, despite a low score on a pilot aptitude test, was also
quickly approved for pilot training, and a commission as a second
lieutenant. After 18 months of pilot training, Bush in June 1970
joined the ranks of part-time fighter pilots at Ellington Field in
Houston. He had a four-year flying commitment remaining at that
point.
</P>
<P>
   In his autobiography, Bush wrote that he flew with his unit for
several years. But the Globe reported recently that Bush abruptly
ceased flying 22 months later, in April 1972, and did not fly
again.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he stopped flying because he moved to Alabama in
May 1972 to work on a US Senate campaign for several months, and
that he performed alternative duty with an Alabama Guard unit. But
there are no records that Bush ever did such duty. And in May 1973,
a half year after Bush returned from Alabama, Bush's two commanders
in Houston said he had not been seen at his unit in 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Both men have since died, and Bush has said he did perform duty.
He said he could no longer fly the F-102 fighter-interceptor he had
been trained on because the unit was switching to a newer jet. As a
result, he was released from the remainder of his commitment just
after he started Harvard in September 1973.
</P>
<P>
   But the unit's own records show, and its former commander,
retired Major General Bobby W. Hodges, said that the F-102 was
still being flown until the year after Bush left the Guard. Hodges,
in a recent interview, echoed the opinion of one of his
subordinates: It was his recollection that Bush did not return to
the Houston unit, instead finishing his military commitment in
Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he (Bush) had come back to Houston, I would have kept him
flying the 102 until he got out,'' Hodges, who is an admirer of
Bush, said. ``But I don't recall him coming back at all.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some records showing Bush attended some drills in
mid-1973, but his official discharge papers that summarize his
truncated service in the Guard do not credit Bush with any drills
after April 1972 _ 18 months before his discharge.
</P>
<P>
   Deepening the mystery, Bush was removed from flight status in
August 1972 for failing to take his annual flight physical. Bush's
campaign aides have said he did not take the physical because he
was in Alabama and his personal physician was in Houston. But
flight physicals can be administered only by certified Air Force
flight surgeons, and there were some assigned at the time to
Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, where Bush was living.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews in May, a Bush aide and a retired Guard personnel
officer who has assisted the Bush campaign in assessing the
governor's records suggested that Bush might have lost interest in
the Guard during that year.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney _ unlike Clinton, who took controversial steps to avoid
the draft _ appears to have played by the rules, according to
Selective Service records. In 1959, the year he finished high
school in Wyoming, Cheney registered with his local Selective
Service board. For almost all of the next six years, until he
graduated from college in 1965, he maintained a student deferment.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney was briefly cleared for possible induction, but he
regained his student deferment when he entered graduate school that
Fall. In October 1965, the Selective Service system put childless
married men in the same draftable status as single men. In January
1966, Cheney received the more prefereable, and durable
classification of 3-A, exempting him from any chance of service
because his wife was 10 weeks pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett, the campaign spokesman, Thursday quoted Cheney as
saying, ``I know where babies come from. And the draft board had
nothing to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman said Cheney's deferments a generation ago pale in
comparison to the defense and foreign policy experience he would
bring to a Bush White House after his four years at Defense, and as
the overseer of the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the Democrats recognized his wisdom, judgment, and
experience when they confirmed him for that job,'' Bartlett said.
The votes to confirm Cheney included that of then-Senator Al Gore.

MOCEANU LOOKING TO GET BACK ON THE BEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ She will not talk about the lawsuit, the restraining
order, or any of the domestic nastiness that once plucked her off
the sports pages and dumped her into the tabloids. ``My family
situation is a closed subject,'' Dominique Moceanu says flatly.
``I'm here to talk about gymnastics.''
</P>
<P>
   After a hellish time when Moceanu ran away from home, sued her
parents to get her independence, then got a court order to keep her
father away, going back to the familiar simplicity of bars, beam,
vault, and floor has been a welcome refuge.
</P>
<P>
   The gym had been her home since she was 3, but when Moceanu went
back last year to work toward a return trip to the Olympics, she
went back in somebody else's body.
</P>
<P>
   She had been the youngest (14) and tiniest (4 feet 5 inches, 75
pounds) of the Magnificent Seven who found gold in Atlanta. Now,
Moceanu is nine inches taller and significantly (she won't say how
much) heavier. ``When I was little, I could flip around very
fast,'' she says. ``But just a couple of inches throws you off. I
had to relearn everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Why even bother? Why put yourself through a brutal grind just to
go where you've already been? ``A lot of the time people are, like,
`Why do you want to come back?' '', acknowledges Moceanu, who is
competing in the women's prelims at the US championships at the
Kiel Center. ``You've done it once, and you've got a gold.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody else had moved on after Atlanta. Kerri Strug and Amy
Chow had gone on to college. Dominique Dawes had gone to Broadway,
then to college. Shannon Miller, Amanda Borden, and Jaycie Phelps
retired. Moceanu was the only one who returned for the 1997 world
championships. She was still only 15. Where else was she going to
go?
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Moceanu hadn't planned on continuing on to Sydney. ``I
was just tired of everything and wanted to get a break from it,''
she says. ``I didn't know if I wanted to do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu's personal life, meanwhile, was coming apart. Her
father, Dumitru, had looted her trust fund of millions to fund his
Houston gym. In the fall of 1998, when she'd just turned 17,
Moceanu asked to be declared a legal adult. Then she got the
restraining order to keep her father from stalking her. (Moceanu
has since made peace with her parents and lives with her mother and
sister in Ohio.)
</P>
<P>
   She moved from Houston to Orlando to Colorado Springs and
finally to Cincinnati, where she began training this year with
coach Mary Lee Tracy alongside Olympic contenders Alyssa Beckerman
and Morgan White.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was going to be hard, and it definitely was,''
Moceanu says. ``But if you set your mind to do something and you
have the right people around you to help you, anything is
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the road back was more demanding than Moceanu had imagined.
She hadn't competed in two years, and she looked it. After he
glimpsed Moceanu at his first monthly boot camp in January, US team
coordinator Bela Karolyi, Moceanu's old coach, declared that she
was kidding herself, that she was looking for short cuts, and he
refused to invite her back.
</P>
<P>
   There were no short cuts, Moceanu finally realized, and set to
whipping her womanly frame back into competitive shape with
twice-daily four-hour workouts. Then she went to the US Classic
earlier this month and placed fifth, easily qualifying for
nationals. ``That helped me get all my jitters out,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Still, getting back on the Olympic squad is an uphill quest.
There are only six roster places, and Moceanu needs to be in the
top three after nationals and next month's trials at the
FleetCenter to get an automatic spot. All but one of last year's
world team members are in the chase, and Miller, Chow, Dawes, and
Phelps are all making comebacks, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to give it 100 percent and know that I can look back
and say I tried and I did the best that I could,'' Moceanu says.
``It would mean the world to me. I would be in tears just to be
back up there and bring home a medal.''

 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It wasn't easy to find a tree to provide camouflage _ at 6 feet
1 inch, 220 pounds, the new kid was a pubescent redwood himself _
but that's what he wanted. Something to stand behind so he wouldn't
stand out.
</P>
<P>
   At 14, Howie Long had arrived in Milford, Mass. with a
misleading label. Despite the rough-and-tumble presumptions
inspired by the deluxe physical package and the hardscrabble return
address _ 7 Albion Place, Charlestown _ there wasn't a lick of
aggressiveness or intimidation in him.
</P>
<P>
   Being uprooted from inner-city intimacy to suburban sprawl, he
``might as well have been moving to Europe, there were so many
differences socially,'' as far as he was concerned after his
grandmother, the family matriarch, had mandated the relocation to
salvage his education and his future. And he was basically shy, a
bit awkward in these foreign surroundings 40 miles west of downtown
Boston on the map but a world removed in the mind. He was a
curiosity seeker who didn't want anyone seeing him as a curiosity.
So he stood behind his hardwood shield and peeked at the strange,
fascinating autumn ritual unfolding in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   A red-and-white phalanx of his fellow students, lined up two by
two as if they were boarding Noah's ark, marched purposefully over
a wooden footbridge traversing a brook and linking acres of
practice space _ more green in one glance than he'd maybe seen in
his whole life in the city _ with the football stadium behind the
high school. And suddenly, where there had been synchronization,
now there was hysteria: cheerleaders cartwheeling around the goal
posts; the red-and-white legion's leaders bursting through a huge
horseshoe banner framing the uprights and featuring a giant scarlet
hawk, the school logo; and then the Scarlet Hawks themselves
shredding the welcoming artwork, the wings on either side of their
helmets making it look as if they just might take flight from the
end zone; the aluminum stands shaking beneath the 1,200 pairs of
stomping feet and bellowing lungs on either side of the field; the
band high-stepping smartly around the adjacent track that was wider
than some of the streets he'd frequented back home; the cacophonous
voices accompanying the strains of the Fighting Irish pep song,
with the key exhortation modified to cheer, cheer for ``Milford
High'' rather than ``old Notre Dame.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Norman Rockwell couldn't have painted it better,'' the new kid
thought. Only one thing was missing from the enchanting tableau:
Him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy,'' Long told himself, ``I want to be part of this.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Funny thing, this business of belonging. It can be a two-way
street. And Howard Matthew Moses Long _ as his grandmother was wont
to call him in her sterner moments _ unwittingly traveled it in
both directions before winding up somehow with a harmonious
convergence rather than a head-on collision.
</P>
<P>
   Belonging. He had a visceral fear of its potential absence. But
that was rendered groundless by the fact that he was engulfed in it
virtually every uncharted step he took. As a result, he's at a
place where he can no longer deny it: at the threshold of the Pro
Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, where Saturday he will be
ushered into immortality as a member of the Class of 2000, along
with former San Francisco 49ers Joe Montana, Ronnie Lott, and Dave
Wilcox, plus Pittsburgh Steelers owner Dan Rooney.
</P>
<P>
   The awe is evident as Long sits in his bucolic manse in
Charlottesville, Va. _ headquarters for the center of his universe:
wife Diane and sons Christopher, 15; Kyle, 11; and Howie, 10 _ and
considers the scope of his achievement in purely numerical terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about it this way,'' says Long, 40. ``There have been
over 18,000 players in the National Football League. Of those, 171
(strictly) players are in the Hall of Fame. And of those, seven are
defensive ends. And now I'm joining them. Do you know how that
makes me feel?''
</P>
<P>
   Overwhelmed, obviously. But more important, accepted. Which is
something he never felt _ or allowed himself to feel _ for even one
play during three years at Milford High, four at Villanova, and 13
with the Oakland-Los Angeles Raiders (1981-93). Especially at the
last, most elite level. The eight Pro Bowl berths and the 1984
Super Bowl championship ring and the universal acclaim that ``for
five years, he was untouchable,'' as former Raiders teammate Matt
Millen puts it, meant nothing to Long. You couldn't take your
reputation out of the bank in times of crisis, so he ignored his.
All that mattered was that the next snap of the ball could expose
his overriding sense of inadequacy.
</P>
<P>
   That's what fueled him to play the position as voraciously as
any man in the game's history. It's what longtime Raiders line
coach, Earl Leggett, who will present him for enshrinement,
recognized during their first lengthy conversation after Long was
Oakland's surprise second-round selection, the 48th overall, in the
1981 NFL draft: ``He was afraid _ afraid of not being a success.''
</P>
<P>
   Millen, now Long's teammate in the Fox NFL broadcasting lineup,
saw the corollary: ``The man's greatest asset was his insecurity.
He never thought he was good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Long supplies the almost mournful epilogue: ``I never enjoyed my
13-year career. It wasn't until afterward that I looked back and
thought I was pretty good. It was a 300-round fight, and you can't
sit around and say, `That was a great round.' It's on to the next
round.''
</P>
<P>
   Until finally, if you're lucky, you've knocked out all the
self-doubts. Long will receive that message Saturday, etched in
bronze. His bust in Canton will be the evidence of what he has come
to suspect more and more strongly since he transferred effortlessly
from a Hall of Fame career to a studio of fame career: ``I don't
have anything left to prove to anybody. I've had my time in the
sun. Everything else now is gravy.''
</P>
<P>
   Stirring this mix of metaphors, the fact is that the glare never
has been brighter, and if anything, the bowl is overflowing.
</P>
<P>
   Long's visibility has increased exponentially in his
post-football life. He would be enough of a household fixture just
for his featured studio analyst's work on Fox. But beyond that are
his ubiquitous television commercials for Radio Shack _ in which
his banter with his pretend spouse is so convincing that many
people think he's married to his costar, Teri Hatcher, rather than
his college sweetheart, Diane Addonizio _ and Coors.
</P>
<P>
   And there is his burgeoning film career, which includes a
supporting role to John Travolta in 1996's ``Broken Arrow'';
headliner status in the 1998 action adventure ``Firestorm''; and
support for Kevin Costner and Kurt Russell in the upcoming ``3,000
Miles To Graceland.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems his granite looks, conveying at once severity and
serenity, and his demeanor, sardonic yet somehow soft and
reassuring, are irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's at the top of his game in all areas,'' says his manager,
Brian Medavoy. ``The hardest part is not getting him jobs, because
everybody loves him. It's availability.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because show business ambition is low on his priority
list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live in Charlottesville (not Hollywood),'' Long says. ``I
don't go to meetings. I tell (his management people), `If somebody
wants me and I can do it, I'd love to go out there.' But I don't
actively pursue it.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Long's major focus is devoting time to his wife, a
college classics scholar and former corporate attorney whom he
calls ``my rock, my best friend, my everything,'' and his sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really impresses me is the way he is with his family,''
says former Villanova assistant Bob Capone, who recruited Long. ``I
told him, `It's almost like you've got a degree in child
psychology.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's one reason Long has turned part of his property
into a playground shrine, replete with a batting cage and pitching
machine, plus a basketball court with lights. Perhaps that's why he
considers his favorite indulgence ``watching my kids play. I'd
rather have 14 kids playing in my yard than not know where my kids
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the prevailing wisdom, that is not a reflex
counteraction to his childhood.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His mother and father, Howard and Margaret, who separated when
he was 11, were not a presence in his formative years. He lived
through adolescence in Charlestown, which some consider a code word
for ``mean streets.'' But that doesn't automatically define a
Dickensian youth. Fifteen years later, Long still bristles at a
national magazine profile he considers to have overdone the urban
urchin angle _ ``Let's not beat this poor white kid thing to
death'' _ and his wary relatives generally shun the press, the
feeling of victimization lingering and hurting.
</P>
<P>
   What he grew up on, Long maintains, were close-knit streets.
Outside the three-decker on Albion where he lived for most of his
first 14 years, he and his friends would engage in endless games of
street hockey. The street was a dead end, so narrow that cars had
to park halfway up on the sidewalk to let traffic through, and if
two vehicles were headed in opposite directions, one would have to
back up so the other could get by. The clatter of the elevated
Orange Line running behind the street provided the background
music, and in those days of the Big, Bad Bruins, Long imagined it
was serenading Albion's answer to Bobby Orr _ him.

BUSH'S EXPLOITATION OF CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Using children as election props is often exploitative, since
your average 11-year-old usually does not ask, ``Sir, why did you
slash funds in your second term for school construction?''
</P>
<P>
   In that spirit, it will be a great day when George W. Bush meets
a child he cannot exploit.
</P>
<P>
   Recently Bush campaigned at a social service agency in Michigan.
He promoted his proposals for adoption in front of banners that
said ``Strong Families, Safe Children.'' The top child in the photo
op was 11-year-old David Claire.
</P>
<P>
   In one photograph, Claire smiled confidently, folding his arms
and gazing out toward the crowd as if he, not Bush, were the
candidate. The only thing missing was a look of shock on the face
of Bush. It would have been a wonderful moment in presidential
politics if the confident smile and satisfied gaze came after
Claire had asked Bush the following questions:
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush, it is nice that you came to be with children
today in Michigan. It is nice that you support adoption. But I have
several reports here in my hand I want to ask you about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is it, sir, that, according to the Children's Rights
Council, a nonprofit organization that is trying to reform child
custody laws, your state, Texas:
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the fourth worst ranked state out of the 50 and the
District of Columbia to raise a child?
</P>
<P>
   ``Has higher percentages of children not immunized than Alabama
or Mississippi, or nearly twice the percentage of nonimmunized
children as liberal/commie Massachusetts?
</P>
<P>
   ``Is tied for the nation's third worst dropout rate?
</P>
<P>
   ``Is tied for the third worst percentage of children in poverty?
</P>
<P>
   ``Is sixth worst in delivering prenatal care?
</P>
<P>
   ``Has fallen from 29th place as a best state to raise a child
under softheaded liberal Ann Richards to 48th under your
`compassionate conservatism?' ''
</P>
<P>
   (Bush mutters that you can always use stats to support your
position).
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, Mr. Governor, I also have here a report from the Food
Research and Action Center, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization
that tracks hunger in the United States. Their report shows that
Texas ranks 44th in the nation for the ratio of school lunches
served in summer programs. Mr. Governor, how can children pass your
standardized tests if they do not eat?''
</P>
<P>
   (Bush mutters something about liberal conspiracies)
</P>
<P>
   ``But Mr. Governor, according Kids Count 2000 by the Annie E.
Casey Foundation, which is very highly respected. Your state does
not do much better. Can you explain why this report has your state
ranked:
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty-fourth in child poverty;
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty-fifth in teen dropout rates;
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortieth in teenage employment?
</P>
<P>
   (Bush scribbles a note to have the FBI wiretap the kid).
</P>
<P>
   ``But Mr. Governor, according to the Children's Defense Fund,
another respected organization, your state looks just as bad. Can
you explain why this report has your state ranked:
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty-sixth in child poverty;
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty-seventh in child immunization;
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty-fifth in early prenatal care;
</P>
<P>
   ``Dead last, 51st, in children lacking health insurance?''
</P>
<P>
   (Bush aides plan photo op at a Dallas pediatrics unit).
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr Governor, the Urban Institute did a study of income
inequality in 13 states, Alabama, California, Colorado, Florida,
Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Jersey, New
York, Washington, Wisconsin, and your state. Why is it in this
study that Texas finishes second only to Mississippi in both
inequality among all children, including two-parent families?
</P>
<P>
   (Bush whispers to an aide to arrange a photo op with the Dallas
Cowboys)
</P>
<P>
   ``But Mr. Governor, according to the Urban Institute, New York,
California and Florida all have plenty of poverty and plenty of
new, foreign-speaking immigrants. They all have about the same
percentage of children below poverty as Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``But why is it, sir, that California and Florida have rates of
uninsured children that are a third less than your state?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is it that New York's percentage of uninsured children is
only half that of your state?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is it that the Urban Institute ranks your state 49th in
children with health insurance?''
</P>
<P>
   (Bush whispers to another aide to set up a photo op with the
Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders)
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, Mr. Governor, for listening to my questions. I know
the American people are waiting to hear how you will do for
America's children what you have done for Texas's children. I have
just one last question. I have here a June story from the Houston
Chronicle. It says your state has `nearly gutted' its school-based
health clinics. If you are for `Strong Families and Safe Children,'
why would you do that, sir?''
</P>
<P>
   (Bush scribbles note: ``Another reason to appoint more good
Supreme Court justices like Antonin Scalia.'')

DEFT TOUCH KEEPS `FIVE SENSES' FROM BEING DULL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
THE FIVE SENSES 
Written and directed by: Jeremy Podeswa 
Starring: Gabrielle Rose, Nadia Litz, Molly Parker, Mary Louise
Parker, Marco Leonardi, Daniel MacIvor, Philippe Volter, Pascale
Bussieres 
Running time: 105 minutes 
Rated: R (sexuality and language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Five Senses,'' with its interweaving of five alienated
people, living in the same building in Toronto, emerging from their
respective states of isolation through their senses, sounds
suffocatingly schematic in outline. The five senses _ touch, sight,
taste, smell, and hearing _ are as prominently spotlit as the
actors. What saves the film from falling on its face is the light
touch of writer-director Jeremy Podeswa. ``The Five Senses'' is a
deft, elegant, melancholy tapestry of flawed outreach, and the big
reason it succeeds is Podeswa's courage in dispensing with a lot of
exposition and trusting the audience _ and the faces of the actors
_ to fill a lot of what otherwise would be gaps.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't do to hit too hard the melodramatic device that gets
the film rolling when massage therapist Gabrielle Rose, who is
stung by how out of touch she is with her teenage daughter (Nadia
Litz), asks the latter to take a client's child for a walk in the
park across the street. The daughter, dreamy and voyeuristic, loses
sight of the child. When the missing child can't be found, the
outlook turns grim. The teenage girl doesn't dare tell her mother
she's attracted to a young boy she met, who shares her interest in
voyeurism. The teenager herself hasn't figured out where she wants
to go with her feelings, or even what they are. Meanwhile, the
search for the little girl intensifies, along with everyone's
anxiety levels.
</P>
<P>
   Mary-Louise Parker's commercial baker, Rona, whose custom-made
party cakes look great but taste bland, finds her anxiety level
rising on the eve of the arrival of a chef, Roberto, whom she met
while vacationing in Italy. At the time, it seemed like a good idea
to continue the fling that had brought zest and savor to her life,
but now that he's coming to visit her on her home turf, she's not
so sure. She discusses the situation with her longtime pal, Daniel
MacIvor's Robert, a professional housecleaner who insists that he
can smell love, and means to look up all his former lovers, male
and female, to see if he can sniff some out in order to fill what
has become an amorous void in his life.
</P>
<P>
   The often catty repartee of Rona and Robert is as close as the
film comes to comic relief, a quality that does not figure much in
the life of their neighbor, Richard (Philippe Volter). He's an eye
doctor who is losing his hearing, and with sad desperation is
trying to amass a sonic memory bank against the day when he will be
completely deaf. These efforts include a phone call to his young
daughter, living in France with his estranged wife. There's a
danger that the senses will supersede the people embodying them.
But Podeswa stays cool and stays tasteful, and the actors carry
``The Five Senses'' past its pitfalls.

AN IRREVERENT LOOK AT DOWN UNDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
IN A SUNBURNED COUNTRY 
By Bill Bryson. 
Broadway Books. 307 pp. $25 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sitting in a hotel bar in Canberra on about his fifth beer, Bill
Bryson is taking notes on how absolutely dull Australia's capital
city is, and makes a notation ``Buy socks.'' Inspiration flashes,
and he draws a cartoon of two salmon resting in a pool midway
through their exhausting swim upstream to spawn. One salmon tells
the other that solitary sex would be easier.
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of comment you don't get from most travel
writers, and it is what makes Bill Bryson so much fun. For a while,
as he proclaims his love for Australia in the preface, there is
fear that Bryson might have softened, lost his edge _ but fear not.
</P>
<P>
   Travel writers don't always pay for their trips, and hence tend
to paint glorious pictures and omit the nitty-gritty that the rest
of us encounter _ the absence of laundromats in Vail, Colo., say,
or what happens to a jar of freeze-dried coffee in your luggage on
an overseas flight.
</P>
<P>
   Bryson writes with a frankness that probably gives the tourist
bureau fits, but the places he visits seem no less attractive for
his humorous honesty (certainly the Appalachian Trail hasn't
suffered much from his best-selling ``A Walk in the Woods''). The
quirks he focuses on provide a fuller sense of where he has been,
such as the little Australian town that has a combination
pet-supply-and-pornography store. He is fascinated, almost
obsessed, by the fact that, in December 1967, Prime Minister Harold
Holt went for a dip in the ocean and was never seen again. Bryson
even visits the site of what he calls the Swim That Needs No Towel,
where a guide tells him that Australia has built a memorial to Holt
_ a municipal swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that Bryson has logged some considerable hours of
dull research (his bibliography lists 66 books) so that he can
present his readers with the more interesting highlights, such as
the discovery of an ant _ the missing link between wasps and ants,
actually _ thought to be extinct. There followed a lapse of 50
years before anybody was able to find such an ant again, and the
second sighting came by accident, when the expedition's truck broke
down 800 miles from the site where scientists hoped to find the
creature.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on this, Bryson notes that Australia is ``at once
staggeringly empty and yet packed with stuff. Interesting stuff,
ancient stuff, stuff not readily explained.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aborigines, for example, must have come to Australia by raft
or boat _ long before anybody else was using either. Once they
arrived, however, they forsook seafaring and apparently forgot
about it. The author grows somber when discussing the plight of
these people, whose treatment brings to mind that of Native
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Bryson gives us a feel for Australia's vastness as he crosses
parts of it by train and automobile. Instead of singing Ninety-nine
Bottles of Beer on the Wall,'' he copes with the bleak Outback by
making up ``approximately forty-seven'' new verses to Australia's
unofficial national anthem, ``Waltzing Matilda.'' (The bawdy stanza
he reveals to readers makes about as much sense as the original.)
So sparse is some of the countryside that ranches have to be
enormous to support their livestock. Australia's biggest ranch is
larger than Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   While everyone knows some part of the story of how rabbits were
brought in and overran Australia, devouring everything in sight,
Bryson gives us an update. A deliberately introduced virus that
affected rabbits and nothing else killed 99.9 percent of them. The
10th of a percent that survived were, of course, resistant to the
virus, so rabbits are on the rise again.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a number of Australia's unique creatures are
endangered, many being killed by, of all things, the common cat, of
which there are 12 million thriving in the country's wilds. People
are slow to recognize that species are disappearing because most of
them are nocturnal and seldom seen.
</P>
<P>
   Bryson's favorite animal-disappearance story involves a
naturalist named Gerard Krefft, who, he recounts, ``in 1857 caught
two very rare pig-footed bandicoots. Unfortunately for science and
for the bandicoots, Krefft soon afterward grew hungry and ate them.
They were, as far as anyone can tell, the last of the species.''

`NUTTY' MURPHY GOES FOR LATEX, NOT LAUGHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
NUTTY PROFESSOR II: THE KLUMPS 
Directed by: Peter Segal 
Screenplay by: Barry Blaustein &AMP; David Sheffield, Paul &AMP; Chris
Weitz 
Starring: Eddie Murphy, Janet Jackson, Larry Miller, John Ales,
Jamal Mixon 
Running time: 105 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (crude humor and sex-related material) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a whole lotta latex goin' on in ``Nutty Professor II:
The Klumps.'' The trouble is that not enough else is going on,
apart from marathon workdays for Eddie Murphy. Except for the latex
Martin Lawrence got away with in ``Big Momma's House,'' Murphy
corners the market on the stuff in ``Nutty Professor II.'' Of
course, Murphy got there first. The Klump family, which stole his
first ``Nutty Professor'' movie, can be viewed as a six-pack of Big
Mommas, with Murphy, then as now, playing all the Klumps except for
the teenaged one embodied by Jamal Mixon. Here they get a lot more
screen time than they did the first time around. But while their
roles are _ no double entendre intended _ meatier, they can do only
so much to ward off sequelitis.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``Nutty Professor'' delivers laughs, especially if you
like flatulence jokes. Some, like those involving the indignities
of aging, are laid on pretty thick, especially when it comes to
salty but saggy grandma, who all but runs corpulent Sherman's
troublemaking alter ego, Buddy Love, off the screen. Buddy's back,
embodying repressed Sherman's inner sex maniac. It must have been a
relief for Murphy to play Buddy, if only because it meant he didn't
have to climb into makeup and a big rubbery envelope that day, as
he did when playing each of the five Klumps.
</P>
<P>
   More interesting than the film is the way it was made. Murphy
played one Klump per day until a given scene was completed. Then
all the footage would be edited together. The result is more of a
tribute to Murphy's concentration and memory than to his comic
inventiveness. Even Buddy isn't quite as outlandishly devilish this
time around. He's merely larcenous, out to steal Sherman's new
invention, a beaker of youth serum, so he can sell it to a
pharmaceutical company for big bucks before the university does.
</P>
<P>
   Since Sherman already won Denise's heart the first time around,
when Jada Pinkett played her, there isn't that much for Janet
Jackson to do as Denise this time around, although she does it
prettily, right down to putting on an enthusiastic face when she
sits down to Klump family dinners and, later, forgiving Sherman for
the words Buddy puts in his mouth. The first movie peaked with the
Klump dining room scene. This time, there are a couple of Klump
bedroom scenes that will make nobody's heart beat faster, and an
eating scene in which the Klumps wipe out an establishment foolish
enough to offer an all-you-can-eat buffet. Otherwise, no bodily
function is neglected in this film, whose theme repeatedly
confronts the ways in which the body betrays, or at least
embarrasses, one.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody can say that Murphy doesn't knock himself out to keep the
laughs coming in ``Nutty Professor II.'' Some are rudely funny,
including a sight gag involving Larry Miller's sleazy university
president and a giant hamster. But there just aren't enough
successful jokes and sight gags to get around the fact that a lot
of ``Nutty Professor II'' plays like filler. You know a film is
desperate when it throws in a lame ``Star Wars'' gag, as ``Nutty
Professor'' does. The Klumps are as sweet as they are crude. That's
the secret of their appeal. That and their ability to always be
bickering yet loving. But ``Nutty Professor II'' is neither funny
nor endearing enough to conceal the fact that, like its star, it
fills the screen with a lot of padding. Less rubbery and more nutty
would have been better.

JO DEE MESSINA SHARES THE GOOD TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A work ethic was deeply ingrained in Jo Dee Messina from an
early age. She grew up in the Boston suburb of Holliston, where she
was one of four children of a single mom who worked long hours to
make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom worked until she was falling off her seat,'' says
Messina, noting how her mother, Mary, did everything fromrun an
answering service to serve as a substitute math teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Messina watched and learned and, now, by dint of her own hard
work as a country singer who wouldn't accept failure, has become
one of the biggest stars in Nashville. Messina's last album, ``I'm
Alright,'' sold 2 million copies. She also became the first country
female to notch three consecutive No. 1 singles _ an incredible
feat considering that only two years before, she was starving and
didn't have enough money to buy a Christmas tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't have a lot of time for myself, but it doesn't
bother me,'' says Messina, 28. ``I love to work _ and I get a lot
of happiness out of working, so to work all of the time doesn't
bother me. I truly believe you have to work hard for the things you
get out of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Messina has continued to perform 200-plus shows per year. She
also has a new CD, ``Burn,'' due Tuesday _ an edgier record than
her last, filled with exuberant songs of survival and hope that
form a logical step forward from ``I'm Alright.''
</P>
<P>
   She no longer gets to Holliston very often _ only about once a
year _ but has taken many of the touchstones from those days with
her. Her mom and her aunt run her fan club. Several friends from
Holliston work for her in various capacities.
</P>
<P>
   Messina does not forget early loyalties, and now that she has
had some success, she is giving back in ways that even have her
business managers nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get hollered at all the time to stop giving it all away!''
says Messina. ``But I'm now able to take care of those around me
and it feels great. My sister has four kids, and I help her with
them. And my mother lives (in Nashville) and I help her. And I help
with miscellaneous things here and there. Some things you read
about, some you don't. . . . I really believe the best part of this
career is being able to help other people.''
</P>
<P>
   An example was when someone left a letter at the merchandise
stand at one of her shows, describing a person who needed a
wheelchair ramp to a van. ``I didn't get the letter until two shows
afterward,'' Messina says. ``Then I read the note to an audience
and said, `Let's set up a box by the T-shirt stand. Throw your
spare change in and whatever you get, I'll match it and we'll send
it to this guy.' So that's what we did.''
</P>
<P>
   As we speak on the phone from her Nashville home, Messina is
almost embarrassed because, that morning, her coproducer, Tim
McGraw (who is also a multiplatinum performer), presented her with
a gift of a 1957 silver Thunderbird in honor of her success. Why a
silver Thunderbird? It's the title of one of her songs.
</P>
<P>
   Messina is rare in this day and age when celebrity usually means
self-indulgent displays of wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as going out and spending a lot of money, I don't do it
for myself,'' she says. ``I can look at something, and whether it
costs $10 or $10,000, I don't know the difference and it just
doesn't matter to me. I'm totally not consumed by price tags.''
</P>
<P>
   She is even embarrassed that her fiance, Don Muzquiz, who is
also her tour manager, gave her a diamond ring that she considered
too extravagant. ``I almost downsized it,'' she says. ``It screams
money and I can't stand that. Money is important to live, but it
doesn't make you a good or a bad person. It doesn't mean you're
better than, or not as good as, another person.''
</P>
<P>
   This philosophy was likewise ingrained during her Holliston
childhood, where her family never had much money. ``Good God, no.
We were lower middle-class, but as middle-class as my mother could
make it,'' she says. ``My mother raised us by herself. Here's a
woman who has four kids and she's trying to keep a roof over their
head in Massachusetts, where the taxes are extraordinary and the
cost of living is higher than normal. And she just did the best she
could. She didn't have a lot, but we had a lot of love and a very
close family. And that's what is most important.''
</P>
<P>
   Messina has sometimes been said to be estranged from her father,
Vincent, who was an athletic director and football coach in
Holliston, and is now a school principal in St. Johnsbury, Vt. Yet
the truth is that she's on good terms with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We e-mail each other all the time,'' she says. ``He's one of
my biggest fans, and I'm his. My dad didn't live with us, but I get
a lot of my energy from him. He'd always come over and spot me in
gymnastics. There's no hard feelings there. He's my dad.''
</P>
<P>
   Like fellow Nashville sensations the Dixie Chicks, Messina has a
young, passionate audience that relates to her effervescent
personality and her will to succeed. ``I have a huge teenage fan
base,'' says Messina. ``Seventy percent of my crowd is under 25. I
haven't been able to figure out why. Maybe it's because I'm a kid
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Messina's new album captures her spirit in such songs as the
rocking ``Dare to Dream'' (``We're still young and in love . . . We
believe we can do something if we dare to dream''), the ballad
``Burn'' (``Be anyone you want to be / Bring alive your
fantasies''), the sexy ``Closer,'' the change-of-pace, socially
conscious ``Angeline'' (a warning to a young girl ``hanging out
with the wrong crowd''), and the percolating ``Saturday Night''
(``Let the night begin'').
</P>
<P>
   Though most of the songs were penned by female songwriters
(Messina didn't write anything for this album, though she has
written before), Messina says she didn't realize the preponderance
of female-written songs until someone pointed it out. ``I was just
looking for good songs that I could relate to,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did she consciously look for songs that express the ``I'm
Alright'' philosophy for which she's become known.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the way I've evolved,'' she says. ``When we were
searching for songs, they would have to hit me and be something
that I feel. And it just so happened that (survivor songs) struck
me. I'd listen to them and say, `You go, girl! I know how that is.'
These were the songs I gravitated to.''

   Entertainment and culture stories from The N.Y. Times News
Service for Saturday, July 29.
</P>
<P>
   BIBLE-ARCHAEOLOGY (Undated) _ A striking shift is now under way
in how a number of archaeologists understand Israel's past. Their
interpretations challenge some of the Bible's best-known stories,
while other finds have turned up new information that supplements
Scripture _ for example, on what happened to Jerusalem after it was
captured by the Babylonians 2,600 years ago. By Gustav Niebuhr.
</P>
<P>
   TRILLING-LITERARY-CRITICISM (Undated) _ How quaint the literary
criticism of Lionel Trilling can seem, now that successive waves of
structuralism, deconstruction, cultural studies, post-colonialism
and other literary technologies have transformed university
departments of literature. But what makes his pieces of continuing
importance is not Trilling's judgment that the Kinsey Report
fetishizes science or that Kipling gave nationalism a bad name. The
essays' subjects really were occasions for Trilling to brood on
much larger themes that, far from being dated or quaint, have lost
none of their urgency. By Edward Rothstein.
</P>
<P>
   SWASTIKAS-REDEEM (Undated) _ Before the Nazi party adopted the
swastika and turned it into the most potent icon of racial hatred,
it traveled the world as a good luck symbol. Buddha's footprints
were said to be swastikas. Synagogues in North Africa, Palestine
and Hartford, Conn., were built with swastika mosaics. Now there is
a small movement afoot to help ``the swastika get on with its
benign life,'' to separate it from ``the sins of the Nazis.'' Is
that really possible? Should it be possible? By Sarah Boxer.

&HT;        WITH CHENEY AT HELM, HALLIBURTON BANKROLLED GOP
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Anand Giridharadas  
 &HT;    c. 2000 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (July 28) - The private sector may have taken Dick
Cheney out of politics, but it did not take the politics out of
Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking the helm at the world's largest oil services
company, Cheney has been an active financial patron of Republican
causes - and appears to have led his firm to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas-based Halliburton Company - where Cheney has been
chief executive since 1995 - has become a stalwart backer of
conservative causes, pumping hundreds of thousands of dollars into
Republican war chests since Cheney's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Keith, a vice president at Halliburton, said Cheney's
position had brought the company higher visibility in Washington.
And records suggest that visibility was buttressed by a stream of
cash from the company's political fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know him and he has been a presence up there. If you have
a personal knowledge of somebody, you might pay more attention to
them,'' she said. ``We try to persuade Congress to see things our
way. I would think his stature adds immeasurably to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Cheney took over, Halliburton has given around $400,000
each election cycle, totaling $1.2 million over six years. All but
$40,000 of it has gone to Republicans, either as soft money - the
loosely regulated gifts to parties - or through political action
committees, which fund clusters of political candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Before Cheney arrived, Halliburton's political contributions
were far smaller and fell somewhat more evenly between the parties.
In the 1992 cycle, the company gave $67,000, a quarter of it to
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have seized on Cheney's selection as an opportunity to
color the ticket as an instrument of ultra-conservative corporate
interests, particularly the oil industry. Texas Gov. George W. Bush
is also a former Texas oilman.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Cheney got to Halliburton, their donations to the
Republican party shot up,'' said Democratic National Committee
spokesman Jenny Backus. ``It is no secret that captains of big
industry see Bush as their guy. I think the American people are
going to reject that. They don't want a government of big oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney himself has donated $52,000 to Republicans since joining
the company. His giving list favors the most conservative members
of Congress: Sens. Trent Lott of Mississippi, Phil Gramm of Texas
and John Ashcroft of Missouri, as well as Reps. Henry Hyde of
Illinois, and Dick Armey and Tom Delay of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton has given most of its money to the political action
committees and to the Republican party, which in turn spends it on
individual races. Company officials have also spent tens of
thousands of dollars sponsoring the annual House-Senate dinners,
which earns them invitations to mingle with party bigwigs.
</P>
<P>
   Even the personal donations of company employees go
overwhelmingly to the Republicans. Federal Election Commission
records show nearly 300 gifts in the last decade, all but a handful
to the GOP. More recently, 17 employees wrote checks to the Bush
campaign. Most of them gave the maximum $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think I'm the token Democrat at Halliburton,'' said
Keith, who gave Bill Clinton $1,000 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Already in this election cycle, the company and its employees
have put $293,000 into political coffers, and only $9,000 of it to
Democrats. That includes $124,000 to the political committees and
$129,000 in soft money. The company gave $500,000 in the 1998
off-year election, and $418,000 in the 1996 race.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republican National Convention, which begins
Monday in Philadelphia, will be a big, boisterous affair,
expensive, tightly scripted, colorful and occasionally dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   But is it important? Will it mean something in the great
democratic process? Or will it be a relic from another era, an
excuse for delegates to take a nice trip, to party and get free
political memorabilia?
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers and delegates insist conventions play an important
role, even though the two most important jobs _ selecting a nominee
and writing a party platform _ will already be done.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, conventions have become sophisticated exercises in
public relations and the art of throwing elaborate parties.
Educating the public and energizing party activists _ what one
political operative calls ``cheer practice'' _ are the most
important byproducts of conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Washington state Rep. Jennifer Dunn, a convention co-chairwoman
who will be attending her seventh convention, said the gathering in
Philadelphia is significant even though it will have no surprises
or intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of convention that every political leader
loves to see and every political pundit hates,'' she said. With no
issue or question to be settled, Dunn said, the convention will
reward people who've worked hard for Republican causes. For the few
who will watch it from afar, ``it will project'' GOP issues.
</P>
<P>
   Polly McWhorter could be Exhibit A for Dunn. A retired teacher
from Auburn, McWhorter has been a loyal and reliable GOP activist
for three decades. The convention, she says, is the big payoff for
all that effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a very exciting thing to go and see how it all works
at the very top of the process,'' said McWhorter, 77. ``And I just
think its going to be a really thrilling thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   For most Americans, however, the words thrilling and convention
do not fit together. Dull and tedious are heard more frequently.
Television ratings have fallen for each of the past three
conventions. Indeed, one of the most memorable moments of the last
Republican convention in 1996 was when Ted Koppel packed up and
left in the middle of it, complaining there was no news to cover.
</P>
<P>
   What excitement there is will likely come from outside the
convention hall. More than 20,000 protesters have converged on
Philadelphia to draw attention to an array of topics, including the
death penalty, global trade, police brutality and the need to find
a cure for AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Only two protest rallies have been officially sanctioned,
however. The first will come on Saturday when protesters stage
their March for universal health care. The Unity 2000 march and
rally will follow on Sunday. Additional events are planned Monday
to draw attention to poor and homeless families and Tuesday to
protest the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Another sideshow is the Shadow Convention organized by
influential Republican Arianna Huffington, designed to focus on
issues that the traditional parties ``just won't touch'' such as
poverty, campaign finance reform and the drug war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parties' flimsy and farcical platform process points up
the vacuum at the center of what we call our political debate.
Their addiction to massive doses of campaign cash has distorted our
policy priorities and led to the neglect of critical issues,''
Huffington said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the speakers scheduled to appear at the Shadow Convention
are Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz. (who also will speak at the real
convention), Russ Feingold, D-Wis., and Paul Wellstone, D-Minn.;
actor Warren Beatty; comedian Al Franken; the Rev. Jesse Jackson;
and former GOP vice presidential candidate and former Housing
Secretary Jack Kemp.
</P>
<P>
   GOP convention planners are so sensitive about the public's
short attention span and competition from the Shadow Convention
they are going to great lengths to quicken the pace and attempt to
add spice to the proceedings. Republicans are striving to keep
speeches to 5 minutes or less and by showcasing ``real people''
rather than politicians.
</P>
<P>
   The convention is built around a theme a day and a noticeable
shortage of politicians with major speaking roles.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there will be people like retired Gen. H. Norman
Schwarzkopf, who will appear Tuesday evening via satellite from the
USS New Jersey to underscore the importance of military readiness.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, California small-business owner Hector Barreto
will be the GOP's human face of its commitment to Latino voters.
Barreto will discuss diversity. Also on Wednesday, single mother
Kim Jennings from Arkansas will discuss the need for tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   The convention also will offer a prominent spot to Erik
Weihenmayer, who has climbed some of the world's tallest mountains
despite being blind. Weihenmayer will lead the Pledge of Allegiance
on the convention's first night.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Larry Craig, a Republican from Idaho who is responsible for
getting the party's message out to the public, said the convention
is important even when public interest is low.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're going to hear from both conventions are the
priorities of both of the parties. Those priorities are ultimately
going to make it into policy,'' he said. ``And it's significant. It
really is.''
</P>
<P>
   But Craig and Dunn are invited to all the A-list parties and
receptions underwritten by corporations and wealthy interest groups
that run non-stop through convention week.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers of the GOP fully recognize the public's
disinterest in their marquee event and they have taken pains to
attract attention and entertain viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Those efforts, however, could not convince the networks. Just as
they did four years ago, the networks are avoiding the convention.
The problem was so acute that in 1996 the Republicans spent $1.3
million to buy time on the Family Channel.
</P>
<P>
   That won't happen this year because GOP organizers believe there
will be sufficient coverage by cable stations and over the
Internet. The heavy-duty lifting will be left to cable stations
such as CNN and C-SPAN, which will televise both conventions
gavel-to-gavel.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the audience will be small. In 1992, less than
one-third of the available audience watched any of the events,
according to the networks. Viewership fell even more in 1996, when
less than 20 percent of people watched.
</P>
<P>
   None of this comes cheap. While TV audiences have declined, the
cost of staging conventions has soared.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican convention will cost $63 million, while Democrats
say they expect to spend $35 million. Each party gets $13 million
in public money for conventions. Much of the rest is raised through
corporate donations.

   BIBLE-ARCHAEOLOGY (Undated) _ A striking shift is now under way
in how a number of archaeologists understand Israel's past. Their
interpretations challenge some of the Bible's best-known stories,

Scripture _ for example, on what happened to Jerusalem after it was

   TRILLING-LITERARY-CRITICISM (Undated) _ How quaint the literary
criticism of Lionel Trilling can seem, now that successive waves of
structuralism, deconstruction, cultural studies, post-colonialism
and other literary technologies have transformed university
departments of literature. But what makes his pieces of continuing
importance is not Trilling's judgment that the Kinsey Report
fetishizes science or that Kipling gave nationalism a bad name. The
essays' subjects really were occasions for Trilling to brood on
much larger themes that, far from being dated or quaint, have lost
none of their urgency. By Edward Rothstein.

<P>
   SWASTIKAS-REDEEM (Undated) _ Before the Nazi party adopted the
swastika and turned it into the most potent icon of racial hatred,
it traveled the world as a good luck symbol. Buddha's footprints
were said to be swastikas. Synagogues in North Africa, Palestine
and Hartford, Conn., were built with swastika mosaics. Now there is
a small movement afoot to help ``the swastika get on with its
benign life,'' to separate it from ``the sins of the Nazis.'' Is
that really possible? Should it be possible? By Sarah Boxer.

NADER GOING ALL OUT IN 2000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY   
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ralph Nader has been mentioned as a presidential candidate in
each of the past four decades, but this year, at the age of 66, he
has finally taken to the campaign trail in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   The consumer advocate and Green Party candidate is campaigning
against what he calls a ``government by global corporations'' that
has warped American democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In presidential preference polls, Nader shows up in single
digits. Still, some supporters of Democratic candidate Al Gore
worry that Nader will drain votes from the vice president,
ultimately helping Republican George W. Bush win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Nader has scorn for both major parties, arguing relentlessly
that they have ``surrendered to large corporations.''
</P>
<P>
   He pledges to pull the United States out of the World Trade
Organization and the North American Free Trade Agreement. Nader
would end what he calls the WTO's ``kangaroo courts'' and ``global
secrecy,'' and pledges to act against repressions by foreign
dictatorships ``that are the bottom line enhancers to U.S.
corporations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who talks of `free trade' doesn't know what he or she
is talking about,'' Nader said in an interview. What is
impoverishing much of the world, he said, is ``corporate-managed
trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Third-party campaigns in American politics often blossom in the
summer. They tend to wilt in the fall as voters look at the
consequences of their vote and want it to count in electing a
president.
</P>
<P>
   Nader is blooming at the moment, particularly in places across
the country with pockets of liberal voters. In Bellingham, Wash.,
activist Del Lowery recently called an organizational meeting for
Nader at the suggestion of Nader's state campaign. More than 100
people turned out.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene Hogan, chairman of the Western Washington University
political science department, wasn't surprised. He said there is a
deep reservoir of activists that Nader can tap.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a big Bill Bradley campaign up here, as well as a lot
of people for John McCain,'' Hogan said. ``We were a hotbed of
organization against the World Trade Organization meeting in
Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, Nader published a best-selling book, ``Unsafe at Any
Speed,'' that exposed safety problems with the Corvair, made by
General Motors. The automobile manufacturer responded by putting
private detectives on his tail. GM ultimately was forced to
apologize to Nader before a Senate committee, turning its worst
critic into a national folk hero.
</P>
<P>
   As the demanding parent of America's consumer movement, Nader
has been a public figure for a third of a century. He was on the
ballot in several states in 1996 _ he took 2.6 percent of
Washington's vote _ but Nader did not actively campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But this year he aims to raise $5 million and propel his way
into this fall's presidential debates.
</P>
<P>
   A famously private man, Nader recently disclosed a net worth
wealth of $3.8 million _ much of it in technology stocks. Unlike
Gore and Bush, he refuses to release his income tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   Nader describes Thomas Jefferson as his model president, and his
campaign as a model of ``Jeffersonian democracy.'' He claims to be
courting support with a message that ``resonates with conservatives
as well as liberals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Conservatives like to have clean air and clean water like
anyone else,'' Nader said.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to find signs of Jefferson's less-government
philosophy, or anything conservative at all, in Nader's pledges or
the Greens' campaign platform.
</P>
<P>
   Nader supports a federally financed universal health care system
and ``total public financing'' of campaigns. He speaks of
appropriating prime time hours from commercial TV stations to put
on public service programming.
</P>
<P>
   The Greens' platform is a curious combination of 1890s
monopoly-busting populism, 1930s-style protectionism and 1960s
social democracy, with calls for a cradle-to-grave welfare state
paid for by the well-off.
</P>
<P>
   The party's platform pledges a six-hour work day with no cut in
pay, along with one-year paid educational leave for every seven
years worked. Free child care would be provided, along with free
education through graduate school.
</P>
<P>
   Americans would get a guaranteed family income of at least
$26,000 per year for a parent with three children, with an extra
$3,250 per child.
</P>
<P>
   The party platform proposes a simple formula for how to pay for
all these benefits: ``Build into the progressive income tax a 100
percent tax on all income over 10 times the minimum wage.''
</P>
<P>
   The Greens make the Justice Department's anti-trust lawsuit
against Microsoft Corp. look like an act of pacifism. The platform
of Nader's party would ``require breakup of any firm with more than
10 percent market share unless it makes a compelling case every
five years in a public regulatory proceeding.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls show Nader taking support away from Gore in
California, Michigan, Oregon and other states. Bush supporters are
hard-put to restrain their glee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three out of every four votes Ralph Nader is getting come from
Al Gore,'' a senior Bush adviser told reporters recently.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Rep. Norm Dicks of Washington, a Gore
confidante, concurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked with Nader when I was on Senator (Warren) Magnuson's
staff,'' Dicks said, ``but I have to say that a vote for Ralph
Nader helps George W. Bush. People will just have to weigh the
consequences of throwing their votes away.''
</P>
<P>
   Some long-committed liberals face a wrenching decision. They are
drawn to Nader but repelled at the prospect of helping bring about
a Bush presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm torn. What I'm weighing is the potential damage with Bush
vs. the strength of message that Nader would send,'' said Seattle
City Councilman Nick Licata, a member of the local Green Party.
</P>
<P>
   Nader has little patience for those who would depict him as a
spoiler, or who say that his candidacy would lead to Bush-appointed
Supreme Court justices who would roll back abortion rights and
safeguards of individual liberties.
</P>
<P>
   He cited such progressive GOP Supreme Court appointees as Earl
Warren, William Brennan, Harry Blackmun and David Souter. ``Not
bad, and all (appointed by) Republicans,'' Nader noted.
</P>
<P>
   He also argued that a flood of Nader votes would help the
Democrats regain control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lets just say I cost Al Gore the election because there is an
outpouring of progressive support for my candidacy,'' Nader said.
``The same logic means Dick Gephardt becomes speaker of the House.
Very few Green Party members are running for Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That wouldn't be so bad for the Democrats, to control the
House. A Republican president could not do anything,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The Greens argue that because corporations control both major
parties, causing the Democrats to lose an election makes no
difference in how the country fares. In recent months, however, TV
screens have carried a different message.
</P>
<P>
   Major corporate interests have taken to the airwaves with
denunciations of Clinton-Gore proposals. The Business Roundtable
has decried the administration's patients bill-of-rights
legislation. The pharmaceutical industry has blanketed the airwaves
with TV spots decrying proposed coverage of prescription drugs
under Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Nader scoffs at the apparent conflicts between the
administration and corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough is never enough for big corporations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democratic Party can give corporations 90 percent of what
they want; they still want the 10 percent'' they don't have.
</P>
<P>
   The debate goes on. For many liberals, it centers on a choice of
dreams or what is achievable.
</P>
<P>
   In Bellingham, activist Lowery promises not to budge from Nader.
``I'm getting old,'' he said, ``and I should be able to vote for
somebody I like before I die.''

&HT;     SHE NEVER LOST LOVE OF THE GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DWIGHT CHAPIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _When Leone Patterson decided to give up
international basketball in 1996, New Zealand coach Carl Dickel
implored her to keep playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked me if I couldn't hold on for just another four
years,'' Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   But she had to say no. She was in her 30s, and had played nearly
a decade for the New Zealand national team. So, even though she was
the captain of the squad, which was slowly building toward a
possible berth in the 2000 Olympics, it was time to move on.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson was set on pursuing a business career, and the
accounting firm she was working for had transferred her to the San
Francisco area.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in the background, though, basketball still tugged at
her. As a pastime, she began playing in leagues like the San
Francisco Bay Area Pro-Am, against good competition, including
several WNBA players.
</P>
<P>
   The skill, and the love of the game, were still there.
</P>
<P>
   She kept in contact with Dickel, who brought the New Zealand
national team here in November to play several college squads.
Patterson was then a member of a Pro-Am all-star team that was
meeting the same area's collegians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did better against them than New Zealand did,'' Patterson
said. ``I thought then that I still could be a part the national
team.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing led to several others, including three exhausting
plane trips home and back for Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   In early January, despite the fact that she had been away from
international competition for more than three years, she made the
cut from 24 to 16 players. Last month, at 37, she was on New
Zealand's final Olympic Games roster of 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been hard,'' she said. ``All the other players have their
own coaches and trainers. I have to do all my training on my own.
But I've been helped a lot by Chiron, the biotech firm in
Emeryville that I work for, and my boss, David Smith. They've been
really supportive. When I told David that I was keen on trying for
the Olympics, he said, `That's great. So what's the problem?'''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson, a slim, 6-foot-1 forward who played at Chapman
College in Southern
</P>
<P>
   California and has lived six years in the United States, is a
member of the Marin team in the Pro-Am league this summer, and
scrimmages against male players whenever she can. She also had a
tryout with the WNBA Los Angeles Sparks and works out frequently at
Stanford with ex-Cardinal players turned pro.
</P>
<P>
   But this is different, because it will be the first Olympic
appearance ever for the New Zealand women's team.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some feeling that we didn't deserve to be there,''
she said. ``Australia, as the host nation, got an automatic bid, so
we were able to qualify in the Oceania zone. But then we played
Slovakia (one of the higher-rated European teams), and even though
they had six players taller than our tallest player, we won one
game against them and lost the other two by less than four points.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really turned our team around in terms of confidence.
After we beat Slovakia, we said, `You know what? We deserve to be
in the Olympics.'''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson has stopped worrying about her own level of play, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was one of the better players when I left New Zealand in
`96,'' she said, ``and I left on a high note. So it was quite a bit
of a risk, from a pride standpoint, to put myself on the line
again. It's been very satisfying to me to learn that I can still do
it, that it's still there.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson hasn't decided exactly what's next, basketball-wise,
after Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just assessing things as they come now,`` she said.
</P>
<P>
   But she has her green card, and likely will keep working in the
Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Work here is much more challenging than back home,`` she said.
``There are no biotech companies in New Zealand. But my family is
all there, and I still have a house there. I can't afford to buy
one here.``

</P>
<P>
   In the four years since we first encountered Sherman Klump, the
overweight genetics nerd has traded Jada Pinkett for Janet Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   It distinguishes Eddie Murphy's first ``Nutty Professor`` remake
from its more raucous, extra-strength redux.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nutty Professor II'' is about how the Klumps (all five of the
grown-ups are played by Murphy) are the engorged American Family,
made flagrantly obese lest you mistake them for people who would
fit comfortably within the confines of a sitcom. And what lies
beneath the geriatric sex talk, incendiary flatulence, sagging
breasts and sprints to the buffet spread is a family saga about
home fires and familial oneness and the time-honored acquisition of
a daughter-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   After years of crushing on Jackson's Professor Denise Gains,
Sherman has asked her to marry him, or rather he's thrown a
pheromone at some CGI fireflies to do the magic. Apparently,
wedding bells and chow bells make the same joyful noise: Mama Klump
starts a kitchen-bound outfitting for Denise in the wedding gown
she was married in.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman, for his part, is experiencing jitters that make him
turn into the Eddie Murphy-who-looks-like-Eddie Murphy, but who
flails and shouts like Little Richard.
</P>
<P>
   Just in time for Sherman's wedding, this Murphy _ the
ultra-randy Buddy Love _ has returned to resume the battle of the
``Ehhhddeees`` (to borrow a Murphy coinage from ``Raw``) in the
not-inappropriate guise of an erection, jabbing at Sherman's tux
during a riotous dream-time wedding to Denise.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy's head pops through the zipper like a Trojan condom
jack-in-the-box; the rest of him crawls through the seat of his
pants. He's both brilliant secretion and horrendous excretion: For
those of you keeping score at home, they're one and the same. The
seam is split on the fabric of good taste, but it's a lewd image
with the summer's only psychological yuck, a declaration of war
between a fat man and his skinny id.
</P>
<P>
   It immediately kicks ``Nutty Professor II'' into a chaotic quest
for control, something Murphy's love interest has had for years.
(Convincing any Jackson to star in a gene-manipulation comedy, by
the way, passes for shrewd.) A shrink informs Sherman that there's
a little Buddy Love dying to get out of everybody's zipper, but
Sherman's case is more acute.
</P>
<P>
   It's like Teddy Pendergrass trying to suppress his inner Sisqo -
that hyperactive sexual question mark dubiously wild about thongs,
who, for 15 minutes, seized hold of America and, for 15 seconds,
the film's soundtrack. Sherman has just discovered the formula for
the fountain of youth, and a big pharmaceutical outfit is offering
Sherman's university a hefty sum. But since Sherman extracted Buddy
Love from his DNA makeup, and Buddy has come to crass life thanks
to a moment of weird science starring a single dog hair, he wants
to sell Sherman's formula, while poor Sherman's IQ free falls.
</P>
<P>
   The film becomes a beat-the-clock story, written by a four-man
crew that includes ``Mr. Show`` co-creator Steve Oedekerk and the
``American Pie`` production team _ ``Chuck and Buck`` actors Paul
and Chris Weitz.
</P>
<P>
   The film's narrative pleasures pale next to the marginalia and
incidentals that Murphy supplies. ``NP II's'' sketch affinities and
gross-out factor are all-you-can-eat, so is the doppelganging.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a hamster that's in heat and shoots its droppings,
Murphy inhabiting a runaway toddler with a lactation fixation that
almost surpasses Jim Carrey's in ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene,'' and the
triumphant return of the sexed-up Granny Klump, who sans her
dentures is as nasty as she wants to be. No disrespect to Peter
``Tommy Boy'' Segal, but his tasks as a director seem limited to
Eddie-wrangling, getting prime reaction shots and seeing that the
hamster launchings hit the extras properly.
</P>
<P>
   Segal's juggling, which gets understandably sluggish by the
finale, is impressive. But the movie's real point of interest _
Murphy to the infinite power _ seems out of his hands. If you want
a clue as to how deep Murphy's inspiration reaches, simply watch
his mouth and eyes in the quick reaction-shot cutaways. The
difference between Carrey and Murphy is the difference between
refraction and embodiment.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy is playing six characters, which brings him closer to the
human comedy of Peter Sellers than Carrey's contortionist
caricatures, which only recently have discovered moderation and
compassion. One man's an ebullient, scary comic strip, the other's
a graphic novel.
</P>
<P>
   And from under Rick Baker's eerily astute prosthetic makeup,
Murphy affectionately saves the Klumps from fatsploitation, giving
them a boundless humanity that imparts black familial
keepin'-it-realism, while letting the rest of America in on the
joke.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, meanwhile, is locked in a reflexive battle of his own
between his lovable-cuddly side and the crass self of yore. His
Buddy Love isn't so much a surrogate for old-school Murphy so much
as the stand-up that ``Delirious'' and ``Raw'' hath wrought.
</P>
<P>
   The Buddy-Sherman skirmish is about the debasement and
subsequent rescue of black comedy from the clutches of ``Comic
View'' and the sorely missed, defunct ``Russell Simmon's Def Jam.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as staggering as Murphy is, the problem remains - how can
Jackson's Denise love Sherman as hard as she does? It's a little
disappointing that the film is so literal about the Buddy-as-dog
bit, keeping him mostly away from Jackson, though she did once
declare that nasty boys don't mean a thing. Finding Sherman's
insult of her mother merely odd, Denise clearly represents the
love-is-blind lobby. Does love have a nose? Maybe she just agrees
that as flicks about dangerously flatulent families go, this one's
a gas.

BUCHANAN STILL RUNNING HARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHARLES POPE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pat Buchanan is running hard for president again,
rebellious and incendiary as ever. But this time, he's a rebel
without a party _ the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   The 61-year-old Buchanan, who was a senior aide to such
Republican icons as Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan and who, as a
candidate for the GOP presidential nomination in 1996 scared the
daylights out of Bob Dole, walked away from the party last October
to join the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons _ and the words _ were vintage Buchanan. The
Republican Party and its candidates, he said, were going soft,
sacrificing long-held values, even diminishing the Constitution.
According to Buchanan, both the Republican and Democratic parties
had become ``front groups for corporate power and special
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, Buchanan said in an interview, Republicans are
nearly indistinguishable from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are Xerox copies of each other,'' Buchanan said of
Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush, citing such issues
as trade, immigration and defense. ``The Republicans have been
Clintonized. It's like professional wrestling. ... They engage in a
wild brawl and then afterward you go into a bar and they're buying
each other a beer.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan made the same point in a speech earlier this year.
``Clinton hails NAFTA, GATT, the WTO and globalization, and like
trained seals, Republicans clap in unison,'' he said. ``Mr. Clinton
favors open borders, a million new immigrants a year and handing
over high-tech jobs to low-wage workers from foreign lands. Bush
and (John) McCain cheer him on, and the congressional Republicans
applaud.''
</P>
<P>
   While he walked away from the party that sustained him for so
many years, Buchanan did not abandon the views that make him such a
political flash point. Indeed, those views remain the anchor of his
long-shot presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He opposes racial preferences in any form, promises to ``defend
our borders'' and slash the number of immigrants entering this
country. He wants to sharply reduce foreign aid, void global trade
agreements such as NAFTA and put an end to more liberal commerce
with China. He would severely limit U.S. military involvement in
places such as Kosovo. He would loosen America's ties to the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Critics accuse Buchanan of being an isolationist, a charge he
rejects. ``I think America ought to be involved in the world,'' he
said in the interview. ``All I want to isolate America from is from
wars that don't involve U.S. interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan vows to be tough on crime, underscoring that pledge
with one of his best applause lines. ``When I raise my hand and
take that oath of office, I promise you, the first thing I do, I'll
turn to Bill Clinton and say, `I'm president, sir, and I'm the
chief law enforcement officer, and you have a right to remain
silent.'''
</P>
<P>
   What he wants, in short, is to take a right-hand turn from the
``cattle-fed conservatives inside the Beltway'' who control today's
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan has undeniable charisma and had some successes in
previous campaigns. But this time, while Buchanan's supporters may
be just as passionate as in the past, they are not nearly as
numerous. Buchanan's campaign is limping along, registering about 6
percent, according to a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll. That
compares with about 9 percent for the other third-party candidate,
Ralph Nader of the Green Party.
</P>
<P>
   It is far less support than Buchanan got in 1996. Then, as a
Republican, Buchanan tapped into voters' nervousness about the
economy, about jobs being siphoned overseas and a general unease
about the United States' stature in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Those issues have all but disappeared in the roaring economy.
Peace has broken out across much of the globe, calming fears about
America's role in the world. All of that has drained the vigor _
and the attention _ from Buchanan's best audience, disaffected
white males.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the support he inspires burns hot. It includes
influential _ and rich _ conservative insiders such as Roger
Milliken, a billionaire textile magnate from South Carolina who has
stood with and financed Buchanan for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not the handmaiden of any other interest except the
nation's interest,'' said Jock Nash, Milliken's representative in
Washington. ``We love the guy. He's for America first, friends
second and everything else third. He's his own man. He doesn't give
some stock answer written for him by some technocrat. He's without
guile.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan vehemently disputes suggestions that he traffics in
discrimination. He rejects charges that he is locking arms with
anti-Semites or far-right militia groups.
</P>
<P>
   But in the tone that made him a nationally known television
personality on such shows as CNN's ``Crossfire,'' Buchanan refuses
to apologize for his beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our campaign and our Buchanan brigades and our new Reform
Party, they are folks who want to fight,'' he said during a news
conference last week. ``They are folks who are willing to stand up
and go down to defeat. They are folks who don't care what The
Washington Post or the Washington press corps says about them. They
believe ideas and ideals matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan is right about that. In 1996, he seriously challenged
Kansas Sen. Dole, the eventual GOP nominee, in the early primaries.
</P>
<P>
   He later was criticized for fatally weakening Dole by forcing
him to embrace a more conservative platform that voters rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as then, Buchanan's pitch is strident and unbending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither party speaks for the forgotten Americans whose jobs
were sent overseas to finance the boom market of the 1990s that the
rest of us enjoy,'' he said in his farewell speech to the
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   His glory days, however, appear to be behind him. This year, he
is fighting a bitter battle within the Reform Party to earn its
nomination. He is also fighting _ on the airwaves as well as in
court _ a decision by the Commission on Presidential Debates to
lock him out of the fall contests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two Beltway thugs have ganged up to be beat up the new boy on
the block,'' Buchanan said during a July 20 news conference. ``Why
are they reflectively hostile to the idea of third parties? Quite
simply, they don't control us. They don't have a golden hook in us.
We speak our own minds; we speak our beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   In the biggest fight of all, he is locked in a tight struggle
with John Hagelin, the former Natural Law Party nominee, to carry
the Reform Party banner in November. The outcome is meaningful,
because whoever is the nominee will qualify for $12.5 million in
federal matching funds. Buchanan says he can't campaign without the
money, and he can't win unless he's allowed to take part in the
debates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective is clearly to get this nomination, to secure the
$12.5 million which we are due, to get us on the ballot in all 50
states, then to go hard from the 15th of August to the 20th of
September,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If he earns the nomination and, more important, gets into the
debates, Buchanan is confident the votes will come. ``I think these
issues will resonate, I think we can make a persuasive case.''

HERE'S THE SUNNY SIDE OF K.D. LANG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GENE STOUT  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Singer-songwriter k.d. lang is enjoying an invincible summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Performing in the summertime is the very best,'' lang said in
a phone interview from Los Angeles. ``There's lots of fresh air,
you get to be outside and you get rejuvenated by the sunshine.''
</P>
<P>
   Summertime was an appropriate time for lang to launch her latest
tour. Her new retro-pop album, ``Invincible Summer,'' was inspired
by her move several years ago to Southern California _ the land of
endless summers _ and several years of self-discovery.
</P>
<P>
   The lush, romantic ``Summerfling'' sets the tone for an album
that recalls the wistfulness and good vibrations of the Beach Boys
and the Mamas and the Papas, as well as the sun-kissed sounds of
'60s bossa nova.
</P>
<P>
   The sweet, sometimes melancholy collection includes ``It's
Happening to You,'' a psychedelia-tinged love song inspired by a
day at the beach, and ``Love's Great Ocean,'' a Roy
Orbison-inspired tune written with longtime songwriting partner Ben
Mink.
</P>
<P>
   The album's title comes from a line by writer Albert Camus: ``In
the depths of winter, I finally learned that within me there lay an
invincible summer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The album is very positive and it reflects where I am in my
life,'' lang said. ``But I'm certainly well aware that this will
pass. Unfortunately, that's just the way of life. I think I'm just
trying to appreciate the moment, but being realistic as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The personal journeys that led to lang's ``Invincible Summer''
began in the mid-'90s after an exhaustive tour in support of her
``All You Can Eat'' album.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really burned out because I had been touring and
recording since I was about 21 _ about 15 years straight,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I just needed to stop and take stock, I guess, and reflect
on what I had accomplished. Because when you're on the treadmill,
you don't really see any results.''
</P>
<P>
   The eclectic Canadian-born singer took about four years off,
going back to work just long enough to record ``Drag,'' the 1997
follow-up to ``All You Can Eat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Drag'' was a wonderful album, exploring human need and
addiction through such songs as ``Don't Smoke in Bed,'' ``Smoke
Rings'' and Steve Miller's ``The Joker.'' But the album's title
might have described lang's growing sense of ennui.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the music business, you become very isolated just being
backstage, in a car, in a hotel room, not having any real
day-to-day life with any real people,'' lang said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I took some time to sort of settle down, get a house, get a
new dog, have a relationship and look at my career. And I
discovered that those things were powerful, powerful influences on
my personality and my relationship toward my music. And I found
that I really did love music.''
</P>
<P>
   Lang, who began her career in the early '80s as a ``torch 'n'
twang'' singer inspired by the music of Patsy Cline, left her
native Canada and bought a home in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd go to the Home Depot and had like 25 people working on my
house. I went to see Wynonna Judd at the Greek Theater and did
things I never really had a chance to do for a very substantial
part of my adult life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I realized that life is art and that music is my craft. It
took a huge burden off my music because I realized that I don't
have to put all of my artistic nature into an album. It's just an
album. I don't have anything to prove anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The theme of ``Invincible Summer'' was in place before lang had
written any songs. ``I shot the album cover before I recorded the
record. I designed the songs around the idea of my head space. The
concept was fairly focused from the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Memories of childhood and youth played a role in the songwriting
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think of my childhood, I think very often of summer
things. And summer just reflects so many attitudes. When you're in
a comfortable stage in a relationship it's kind of like summer to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-producing the album with lang was Damian LeGassick, who has
worked with Madonna and techno artist William Orbit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to update my sound and have some new blood,'' lang
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took the k.d. lang sound and, using the same musicians that
I've worked with for years and years, updated it without
overproducing it or making it a dance record. There's a little bit
of a new lacquer on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Though lang began her career as an alternative-country artist,
her connection to Nashville today is almost nil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have a connection with country music in my soul,'' she
said. ``And I would expect that two or three records down the road
I'll make the most legitimate, the most raw and the most
straight-ahead country record I've made yet. I can feel it. I just
have to sit down and write it. It'll be thrilling because I love
country.''

PROPER CASING WILL RESIST ROT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July   30, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. The trim around my exterior doors is decaying. You can chip
out wood with your fingernail. This softness goes halfway up the
trim from the floor. The trim is only five years old. Can I restore
it or replace it?
</P>
<P>
   BRANDY BRANDON, Acton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The trim may be too thin to try to dig out the decay and fill
with an epoxy wood filler. The reason the decay occurred is, I
think, because the casing (the trim) was applied and then caulked.
The idea was to keep out moisture, but if any moisture got behind
the trim it was trapped, causing the decay. Old-fashioned casing
was installed loose, uncaulked, so if moisture got behind it, it
would drain away, allowing the casing to last longer.
</P>
<P>
   So, to replace, try this: Use pressure-treated wood to avoid a
similar semi-disaster in the future. Such wood takes primer and
paint and/or stain very well. Cut off the old trim, being sure to
take all the decayed wood. Cut a new trim to match the old, and
nail it. Do not caulk it, except where the two pieces meet. Or,
replace the whole casing.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I spilled ammonia on an old dark oak table, and you can
imagine what happened. It made a big white spot. Can I remove that
spot, or do I have to refinish the top?
</P>
<P>
   J.F., Boxford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I think the ammonia bleached the finish, so the top must be
refinished. Usually, cloudy stains such as water rings from a glass
left on the table, or from heat, are on the very top of the finish,
and can be rubbed off with an abrasive. But you can still try the
abrasive technique on the ammonia stain. Rub the stain with
toothpaste, which has an abrasive in it. If the stain is reduced,
keep at it. If not, refinish.
</P>
<P>
   Sand the top to the bare wood, apply a penetrating oil stain to
match the old color, and apply two or three thin coats of an
oil-based polyurethane varnish.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I live on the waterfont and get a lot of storms. I noticed
that lighthouses have orange-shingled roofs, but roofers don't seem
to know why. Do you? I figure if lighthouses, subject to high winds
and bad weather, have roofs that stand up to the weather, I could
install a similar roof on my house. My roof shingles tend to blow
off more than normal, or more than on houses inland. What is the
best shingle to resist winds and bad weather?
</P>
<P>
   JAMES ADAMS, Quincy, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I looked up the lighthouses in the western Great Lakes (my
old stomping grounds), and many had orange or red roofs, similar to
those in the East. While some of those roofs are asphalt, I imagine
some are clay tile, very durable and resistant to blowing off. And,
very expensive. There are companies that do tiles, but they are not
that common anywhere except in the South and Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   For you, I think organic shingles will work well. Organic
shingles have a saturated felt core, as opposed to modern shingles
that have a fiberglass core. All are covered with asphalt, and
gravel for color. Organics are more flexible than fiberglass, and
should resist winds better.
</P>
<P>
   Also, have the roofer put a slather of roofing cement under each
shingle along the edge of the roof, where the roof goes up at an
angle. This roofing cement should also go under the shingles along
the eave edge of the roof. It is along the edges that wind often
gets a bite, and mostly edge shingles get blown away.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The black stripes on my aluminum awnings are faded. Can I
paint them with black paint? I think the paint is baked enamel. I
want to keep the contrasting white, which is in good shape.
</P>
<P>
   SAM DANIELS, Arlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Sand the stripes reasonably heavily, then wash with Spic and
Span and water. Let dry, and paint with a thin coat of an oil-based
primer and finish with latex house paint. Or, use a Krylon aerosol
spray primer and finish. Mask the stripes thoroughly to avoid
getting paint where you don't want it.
</P>
<P>
   While expensive (as paints go), the Krylon spray cans are a
convenient way to spray certain painting projects.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The bathroom in my 1850 house is 7 by 12 feet, and runs
parallel to the roofline. There is an attic above the suspended
ceiling, and five horizontal beams connecting the two walls, which
act as a base for the flat ceiling (attic floor). I'd like to
remove the existing ceiling and make it a cathedral ceiling. Can I
take those horizontal beams down?
</P>
<P>
   LEVON Chorbajian, Billerica, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I think you can, especially since their full length will not
be removed, with their remaining length over the adjacent bedroom
ceiling. But to be safe and legal, consult an architect or
structural engineer, for a fee, to make sure you can, and how to do
it.
</P>
<P>
   You might be allowed to remove all the beams or just one, two,
or three. If you have to leave some, they can act as a decorative
part of that cathedral ceiling.

OW THE BEAT WILL GO ON, AFTER NAPSTER

<P>
   Forget Don McLean and the old war horse ``American Pie.''
Friday, July 28, will go down in history as the day the music died
_ at least for the 20 million or so users of Napster.
</P>
<P>
   In the past nine months the wildly popular music-swapping
service has become a sort of cultural glue that defines a
generation that has grown up on the Internet. That was set to end
Friday night at midnight (Pacific Daylight Time), when the court
order to shut the service down went into effect.
</P>
<P>
   So what happens next? Will some other college dropout in a
baseball cap emerge as the poster child for digital music on the
Internet? Will millions of irate Napster users migrate to other
file-sharing services, sparking another slew of lawsuits? Or will
the recording industry figure out how to woo Napster users by
marketing its products online?
</P>
<P>
   It all comes down to a simple verb. Napster defenders insist
that music needs to (itals)be(unitals) free, while record-label
execs contend that music just needs to (itals)feel(unitals) free.
And therein lies the crux of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   The folks in the ``be free'' camp include free-speech zealots,
open-source advocates, and millions of college students and
teenagers accustomed to collecting and listening to music online.
These folks will likely migrate to (and aggressively promote) other
file-sharing programs available online. The Napster chat rooms were
abuzz with options Thursday as users pointed one another to Web
sites like www.napigator.com or www.cuteMX.com and to programs like
Gnutella, Freenet, or Scour Exchange. (The founder of Napigator
said traffic to his site had tripled Thursday.)
</P>
<P>
   A user who goes by the handle Knotpine put it this way: ``We
will find new ways to download music . . . and there is no way on
earth that the music industry or anyone else can stop it.'' Others
spoke in revolutionary terms: ``We need to attack! We need to
provoke a riot!'' wrote a user called Operatorz.
</P>
<P>
   John Perry Barlow, former songwriter for the Grateful Dead and a
champion of free information online, was quick to advocate radical
action. ``I suggest massive civil disobedience,'' he wrote shortly
after the ruling came down. Thursday he said that the injunction
would create a backlash that is unstoppable _ and ultimately more
threatening to the record industry. The folks who are developing
other file-swapping programs will now work harder to create systems
that are impossible to trace. ``In that sense, (the record labels)
have created a whole new class of Hezbollah,'' he said. ``They have
radicalized the Internet community. Instead of developing networks
to address a problem, they are now doing it to make a political
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Ian Clarke, in fact, is one of those people. The 23-year-old
Irish computer engineer is the mastermind behind Freenet, a
decentralized file-sharing network that offers complete anonymity
for its users. Napster shares all of its files through a central
server that can be shut down, but Freenet creates a spiderweblike
network of computers with no central source, making it impossible
to shut down. ``The ruling is sad, and it is dangerous,'' he said
Thursday. ``It also demonstrates that when you design a network to
promote free speech, you must design it so it isn't susceptible to
the form of legal attack that Napster has seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, recording-industry executives don't agree that music
needs to be free. But while they have been lagging behind in
getting their product online, their marketing executives have
absorbed one critical lesson from Napster: Music needs to feel
free. That was the rallying cry at Plug-In, a digital music
conference in New York that ended the day before the Napster
decision. At that conference, the ``be free'' folks sparred openly
with the ``feel free'' contingent. When Elizabeth Brooks, Napster's
vice president of marketing, said, ``We absolutely respect
copyright,'' Ted Cohen, EMI's vice president of new media, snapped
back, ``How many payments have you made?''
</P>
<P>
   But Cohen, an industry veteran, also said that he would be
willing to work with Napster under the right circumstances. That's
where the ``feel free'' notion comes in. All of the major record
companies and scores of Internet start-up companies are struggling
to develop online music services that make money but seem free to
consumers. Ultimately, these services will enable users to listen
to digital music not only on their computers, but also on stereos,
portable players, and even cell phones. Some, like EMI, are
planning to launch music-subscription services, which, like cable
television, seem free to users who simply turn on the switch
whenever they feel like it. The Internet company eMusic, in fact,
launched a subscription service this week; it has gained licenses
from scores of independent labels whose music is featured on the
service.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, musicbank, a San Francisco-based start-up, has been
negotiating licensing deals with the major record companies to
offer a service that will enable users to store music they own in
an online locker that they can access from any computer hooked up
to the Internet. This week, it signed a deal with Universal Music
Group, the major record label that is widely viewed as the least
likely to work with Internet start-ups and the most protective of
its music catalog. Users won't pay a dime for musicbank's service,
which is set to launch in September. The service will support
itself with advertisements; like radio, it simply feels free.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first to sign agreements with all the labels will be well
ahead of the pack,'' said musicbank cofounder Pierce Ledbetter.
</P>
<P>
   And so the race is on to become the It brand in the post-Napster
era. A company called Click Radio offers a personalized Net radio
service that enables users to customize their song lists. Its
source of revenue: advertising. Another new company, called
Gigabeat, just launched a music portal that suggests music to its
users. Ditto for Music Buddha, which offers a music-recommendation
service.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these start-ups were founded by young engineers who seem
similar to Napster founder Shawn Fanning. The difference is that
they are not openly defying the music industry. And they're all
trying to capitalize on the Napster ruling by touting their
companies as ``legal alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the major labels are trying to figure out how to use
the idea of Napster and make money at the same time. One idea
encourages music sharing as a kind of viral marketing scheme. For
instance, one user buys a digital version of an album and then
sends it to a friend. That friend has two days to decide whether to
buy the music before it expires. In addition, the labels are also
quietly exploring ways to launch Napster-like sharing services that
make money via advertising or subscription fees.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the Napster revolution? Isn't part of its appeal
based in its underground status? ``It's like any revolution,'' said
Talal Shaloom, senior vice president of media at the Internet
security company InterTrust. ``The revolutionaries never get to see
the promised land.''
</P>
<P>
   That very notion infuriates the folks who started the movement
and who are now more determined than ever that music must be free.
``You cannot kill it,'' said Barlow.
</P>
<P>
   But many observers think that it will be business as usual in
the recording industry once the dust has settled around the Napster
case. The powers that be in the entertainment industry, after all,
can just keep suing and suing and suing while they buy time to
develop their own digital delivery systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you combat a black market?'' asked Shaloom. ``You don't
go after the pirateers. You compete. You create value.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the ``feel free'' folks are beating the ``be free''
folks, at least in the courts. Meanwhile, the developers of
alternative systems are vowing to keep the music flowing. That
tension has yet to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before the decision, Napster CEO Hank Barry was asked
what would happen if his company lost the case. ``Maybe we'd have
the Napster memorial site,'' he said, without smiling. It doesn't
look like anyone will need it. One way or the other, digital music
will be available online.

 OFFICE CASUAL-DRESS POLICIES SPARK A BACKLASH  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Andy Pike, 29, a Boston investment banker, wants it every
morning, but it's now a sort of forbidden pleasure. He didn't even
realize how much he liked it, that feeling of power it bestowed,
until he had to stop doing it just to fit in around the office.
</P>
<P>
   Pike wants to wear a suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a uniform,'' said Pike, whose firm approved casual day
everyday this summer for the first time. ``You just get up in the
morning and grab a suit. When you're in a meeting with older men,
the suit makes you feel more like an equal.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray-haired traditionalists aren't the only ones balking as
corporate America leaps onto the Casual-Day bandwagon. Resisters of
this trend now encompass a broad cross-section of workers,
including younger men and minorities scratching to make their first
big marks in their careers. Some complain that their Polo shirts
and Gap khakis invite questions about how to fix the copy machine
jam or mail an express package.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still more accustomed to wearing a suit than not wearing
one,'' said Ed Colbert, a Boston attorney in his early 30s whose
firm, Looney and Grossman, is intensely debating whether to extend
five-day casual day beyond this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Men have clearly struggled more with casual day than women, who
have never stuck to a corporate uniform and who have a wider
selection when it comes to choosing attire. Psychologists say many
men, to some degree, see casual day as yet another arena where they
have to compete. Indeed the jungle of casual fashion requires a
mix-and-match ability and a fashion sense that many men say they
don't possess.
</P>
<P>
   ``When everyone wears the same suit, there's less competition,''
said clinical psychologist Jerrold Lee Shapiro, adding that men's
suits can be thought of like competition-reducing school uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Some employers and workers say they don't like the way
dress-down day has turned into leisure day, affecting not only
attire but behavior. They aren't surprised by a national study this
year showing that 44 percent of firms that allow casual dress at
least one day a week, saw an increase in tardiness and absenteeim
among staff. Flirtatious behavior went up in 30 percent at these
firms, according to the study by Jackson Lewis, a New York
employment law firm.
</P>
<P>
   While clearly an overwhelming majority of workers see casual
dress policies as a popular job perk, a small but increasingly
vocal group dismiss it as a mere passing fad.
</P>
<P>
   They say these policies are naively supported by young
professionals who never had to scramble to win new clients, even if
only marginally through the image of suits and ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``They take it for granted that they're a genius because they
get paid so much,'' said John Dineen, 72, a partner at Peabody and
Arnold. ``They don't remember the hard times when you had to hustle
for business.''
</P>
<P>
   While some men's retailers hope to revive the suit this fall
with dress-up Thursdays, many workers see no way to reverse the
casualization of work attire. Consider that in 1992, 24 percent of
American companies offered at least one day of casual dress. Last
year, about 95 percent of companies had some kind of casual day
policy, according to the Society for Human Resource Management, a
trade group for personnel managers.
</P>
<P>
   While this same group reports a slight dip for this year _ 87
percent permit at least one day of casual attire _ it remains to be
seen if this is a part of a real backlash or a blip in the trend
that began when Silicon Valley high-tech entrepreneurs went to work
in jeans and T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   That level of informality, however, isn't the acceptable
``business casual'' as defined by most companies. In fact, many
companies that find casualness has gone too far have issued memos
that clearly ban such things as halter tops, stretch pants, jeans
and shirts without collars.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, the every day casual day movement took off last fall
after one of city's biggest law firms, Hale and Dorr, announced its
lawyers would no longer be required to wear suits.
</P>
<P>
   As casual clothes have spread from Fridays to all days and
summers only to every month, some people complain of a new fashion
facism. Donning a suit _ when you aren't seeing a client or
attending a formal meeting _ can project the image of being stuck
in the past or shamelessly seeking the approval of the firm's
old-liners.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some internal pressure to conform and not wear a
suit,'' said a Hale &AMP; Dorr law associate in his 30s who asked that
his name not be revealed. ``If you wear a suit, people ask, `Did
you go to court today?' or `What did you do that was so important?'
''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Olohan, 30, an associate at the law firm, Nutter, McClennen
and Fish, said he likes the suit-and-tie uniform for lawyers, and
doesn't understand why the legal profession is copying the attire
of high-tech geeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good thing we don't depend on first-degree murder
defendants as our clients,'' he said. ``We'd all be wearing orange
jump suits.''
</P>
<P>
   What to wear to work carries a particular significance for
minority professionals, said Monroe ``Bud'' Moseley, vice president
of a Boston executive-search firm. While informal dress can lead to
a less stratified work environment, a plus for many minorities, it
can also be ``an additional opportunity'' to diminish the status of
minority professionals, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Golden Hebsgaard, executive director of the Boston Law
Firm Group, which advocates for more minority recruitment at law
firms, said, ``Casual day standards may not be the same'' for
minority workers. She advises young minority attorneys to stay on
the conservative side of ``business casual,'' which means
well-pressed slacks and collared shirts.
</P>
<P>
   A 34-year-old attorney at one of Boston's largest firms, who is
African-American, gave the sobering observation that even when he's
dressed in a suit, he is often mistaken for working as a paralegal
or a member of the support staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think, `He's black, he's can't be a lawyer,'' said this
attorney, who asked to remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Boston College sociologist Charles Derber said he thinks anxiety
about casual business dress also reflects a persistent insecurity
among today's workers, even in a good economy, about just where
they stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in this boom period, workers are struggling with the
rapidly changing work environment,'' he said. ``Maybe people are
looking for some trappings of order.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston venture capitalist Bill Collatos predicted that the end
of the boom, a recession, will ultimately be what rains on the
dress-down day parade. Though he enjoys the benefits of casual
attire, he always hears his father's saying, ``A tie is the
cheapest form of dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that people remember the attire of two men _ Steve
Case, chairman of America Online, and Gerald Levin, chairman of
Time Warner _ during their momentous press conference in January
when AOL bought Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Case was wearing a tie, and Levin had on only a shirt,''
Collatos said. ``And remember who was buying whom.''

 ANDREA NICHOLSON MAKES BUYING SWIMWEAR A LITTLE BIT EASIER  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEYMOUTH, Mass. _ In a strip-mall storefront near the former
naval air base lies an emotional front line for body-image angst.
And Andrea Nicholson may as well be the Florence Nightingale of
this battlefield, selling swimsuits at Ujena to women who mostly
see flawed hips, abdomens, or chests taunting them in the dressing
room mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   For four summers Nicholson, a 20-year-old dental hygienist in
training, has had what seems like a simple job: Be attentive. Keep
the store clean. Watch that the clip hangers don't snag the
merchandise. And most important, make sure customers leave with the
most flattering suits.
</P>
<P>
   The last is the difficult part _ convincing women that they can
look good in a bathing suit.
</P>
<P>
   One recent cloudy day, a middle-aged shopper heads straight to
the racks, quickly scours them for two-piece suits, and strides
into a fitting room. A few minutes later, the customer hands over
the pile of rejects and leaves before Nicholson can say, ``May I
help you?''
</P>
<P>
   This Nicholson knows for certain: She's not the only woman who
would like the figure of a supermodel, even though she's fit and
thin enough that some customers might be satisfied to swap bodies
with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see women in here that are beautiful. Look awesome in
bathing suits. Everybody has something about their bodies that
they're self-conscious about,'' Nicholson says. ``It definitely
makes me feel more comfortable with the fact that it's just not me
who feels that way. You can pick your body apart and let it consume
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson's neighbor, Peter O'Keefe, who owns two Ujena
franchises, told her she could work for him when she turned 16.
She's been here every summer since then, and now earns money for
college textbooks while getting an education she never expected in
self-image and fragile psyches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing my boss ever said to me is `Don't ever let
somebody leave the store looking bad.' I thought, `How can I say
that to them?' But they're very open to other people's advice. We
usually tell them if something doesn't look right,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just helping them look good in a bathing suit,'' she
adds. ``You're boosting their self-esteem.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson tries to stanch customers' frustration by making sure
they have the right size, immediately. But alas, on this particular
morning, the only person in the store who seems happy _ besides
Nicholson _ is the delivery man.
</P>
<P>
   What is it about guys and bathing suits?
</P>
<P>
   She thinks it's ``ridiculous'' when women let their boyfriends
or husbands choose the bathing suit they buy instead of just
offering advice. ``There are some guys who are angels. But guys are
guys,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I tell boys I work at a bathing-suits store, it's like
`ooooh,' '' she adds. Then the wisecracks start: Do you model them?
``It's not like that,'' says Nicholson, who, on this particular
day, is wearing a handkerchief-print sundress and platform sandals,
not the merchandise, at work. ``It's just retail.''
</P>
<P>
   This retail store specializes in D cups, allowing customers to
choose the bra of a two-piece suit in one size and the bottoms in
another. So maybe it's to be expected that the figure dilemma most
of Nicholson's customers face is above, not below, the waist. ``So
many girls, even myself, have big chests,'' she says. ``It's a
self-conscious thing. You're showing more than you want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Her advice? Go up a size in the top and down one size for
bottoms because they stretch when they hit water. Sagging bikinis,
Nicholson notes, like everything else that sags, can be really
unattractive.
</P>
<P>
   Think again, she adds, before opting for a one-piece suit to
cover a large chest. Often maillots offer little support _ even
with those elastic-bands-as-underwires _ and hence don't always
look best. Surprisingly, bandeau tops look better on many women
than customers believe. Larger-busted women should consider a
properly fitting bikini, as should more average sizes. A 34B woman
should pick a medium-size top, she says, pointing to a wall of
suits, and ``take the pads out.''
</P>
<P>
   To the customer concerned about her hips (but not her belly),
Nicholson suggests that string bikini bottoms _ believe it or not _
can be slenderizing. ``Sometimes if you have chubby legs,'' she
advises skeptical customers, ``it's best not to get something
fuller.'' And it takes ``pencil-thin legs'' to make shorts-style
bottoms flattering. ``I can't wear them for anything,'' Nicholson
says.
</P>
<P>
   What about skirted suits? Here Nicholson is the equivocating
saleswoman. ``Um,'' she says, ``people like the coverage. A lot of
mothers come in for tankinis and skirts.''
</P>
<P>
   And style? Thongs are popular this year. ``To each his own,''
Nicholson says. Matching mother/daughter suits, she adds, are
``very cute.'' And silver lame is a trend on the upswing.
</P>
<P>
   To the customers who wander in looking for beach chairs or
plastic nose protectors to block the sun, Nicholson says sorry, she
sells only bathing suits and cover-ups.
</P>
<P>
   During the lull between customers, Nicholson vacuums the gray
industrial-grade carpeting or straightens the racks and racks of
bikinis, strings everywhere. She wipes down the two tanning beds,
tucked in the back of the store, after each use.
</P>
<P>
   After watching customers, many of whom ``are addicted'' to the
20 minutes of solitude under the tanning lights, Nicholson was
moved to try it herself. She was so nervous the first time she
tanned that she accidentally left on her socks. Now, she does it
once a week, for free, and hopes she's not doing it often enough to
tempt skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   So it's hard to tell from looking at her that, between work and
summer school, Nicholson doesn't get much chance to go to the beach
in the cornflower blue string bikini that she bought with an
employee discount at Ujena.
</P>
<P>
   But when she does, she says, ``I get so excited when I see a
Ujena suit.''

   Robert Wright, the longtime chief of broadcasting giant NBC,
will take the post of vice chairman of the board for General
Electric (GE:NYSE), the television network's parent, GE, announced
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, 57, will continue at NBC's helm, a seat he has occupied
for nearly 14 years, and will be responsible for overseeing GE's
media interest in his new role, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob's a visionary with a great strategic mind, and he's a
strong business leader with outstanding people skills,'' GE
chairman and chief executive Jack Welch said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, analyst Lawrence Horan said, NBC could play an
increasingly vital role as GE puts an added emphasis on the
communications and information fields. GE's decision to broaden
Wright's influence, he added, reflects that commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giving Wright additional leadership responsibilities is
important,'' saod Horan, who follows the company for Parker/Hunter.
``It raises his strategic importance.''
</P>
<P>
   Welch plans to retire in 2001, and analysts who track the
company have said the presidents of GE Medical Systems, GE Power
Systems and GE Aircraft Engines are the apparent frontrunners for
Welch's position.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of GE were down 1 3/8, or 3 percent, to 51 1/8 in
afternoon trading.

&HT;     SOCCER STAR TO SHINE IN SYDNEY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   In one sense, Tiffeny Milbrett highlights the glorious recent
past in U.S. women's soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Milbrett, a native of Port- land, Ore., scored the deciding goal
in the gold-medal game at the 1996 Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Nicknamed ``Kawasaki 5000'' for her speed on the field, she also
led the team in scoring during its run to the 1999 Women's World
Cup title.
</P>
<P>
   Golden memories, for sure.
</P>
<P>
   But the 27-year-old Milbrett also represents the future of her
sport.
</P>
<P>
   Milbrett not only will play a critical role in the team's quest
for a second Olympic gold in September, she also will rev her
engine for the high-visibility New York franchise in the Women's
United Soccer Association inaugural season next year.
</P>
<P>
   Tony DiCicco, the WUSA's acting commissioner, said the 5-foot-2,
130-pound forward can live up to the marquee billing.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways,'' said DiCicco, ``Tiffeny is considered our most
dangerous player. She will be playing for the New York team, and
her star qualities will be very visible.''
</P>
<P>
   DiCicco coached the women's national team for six years before
he resigned last fall to help start the professional league. He
predicted that Milbrett, with an engaging personality, would be a
good fit in the spotlight of the Big Apple.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is a bit of a nut,'' DiCicco said. ``Tiffeny and Julie
Foudy, they will say anything, and it's all genuine. But the real
reason she'll be in New York is her star quality. We needed a
big-time star there. She was one of the few we considered, and she
was excited to go.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with the national media in May, Milbrett brushed
off a suggestion that the women's team needed to win a gold medal
in Sydney to boost the pro league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we want to win (the gold), for sure,'' Milbrett said.
``(But) I don't think the pressure to have to win is there. I think
most definitely that pressure was there in 1999 (at the World Cup).
This year, it's not so much pressure from the outside anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   As the U.S. team has stormed through Europe in its Olympic
preparation, Milbrett has been hotter than a South Texas summer
day.
</P>
<P>
   She has scored three goals in six games this month, and DiCicco
sees a different player than the one who joined the national team
on a limited basis in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiffeny was always a tremendous talent,'' DiCicco said in a
telephone interview. ``She was one player who had scoring instincts
and tremendous acceleration. She shot righty or lefty. The
difference now is, she's more mature.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in the early '90s, Milbrett lacked high-level
endurance and needed ``bushels'' of opportunities to score a goal,
DiCicco said.
</P>
<P>
   She beat Brazil with the only goal of the game in the DFB 100th
Anniversary Tournament in Germany on July 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' DiCicco said, ``she doesn't need a bushel-full of
opportunities, and that's a sign of maturity. She can win a game
for you in the 90th minute. I think she wants to be known as the
best striker in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past four years, Milbrett has been overshadowed to an
extent by teammates Mia Hamm and Brandi Chastain.
</P>
<P>
   But Milbrett believes that name recognition is high for all the
players among fans who have purchased tickets and sat in the stands
for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite possibly, people who don't attend our games know only a
couple of names,'' Milbrett said. ``But the people who come to our
games, they know everybody's names. I noticed that back in 1998 at
the U.S. Cup in Boston, against Mexico. That's when I noticed a
change in the crowd -- the excitement, the passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they knew everyone's names. I was shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Milbrett, who has eight goals and eight assists in 18 games this
year, said players have adjusted to life under first-year U.S. head
coach April Heinrichs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was nervous at first,'' Milbrett said. ``But we've
gained confidence with her, because we've had time to learn her
style. Nobody knew her style. Nobody had spent too much time around
her as a head coach. But everything is fine. Now, it's just back to
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Milbrett, one of the team's all-time leaders in minutes, goals
and assists, predicted the change from DiCicco to Heinrichs would
yield positive results at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The national team had been under the same coaches for six
years,'' she said.

 &HT;    FOR FRENCH, CRASH OF CONCORDE ALSO MARKS DEATH OF A GREAT SYMBOL
 &HT;    For Use Sun., July 30 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GONESSE, France _ Outside his creme-colored house on a quiet
flowered suburban street, Marc Girel trims his roses with an eye on
the cloud-filled sky.
</P>
<P>
   Every few minutes, a passenger jet flies over Girel's house from
Charles De Gaulle International Airport three miles away. The
68-year-old retired civil engineer takes pleasure in the sound _
some would say, noise _ made by the jets because of his lifelong
love affair with airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   But today, something is missing. ``It's not the same,'' he says,
after pausing with his clippers to watch a plane pass overhead. ``I
miss the Concorde.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, one of Air France's six supersonic Concordes crashed
less than two minutes after take-off, killing 114 people in a
violent white-hot explosion that disintegrated the aircraft and
incinerated a small hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The accident site is a short drive from Girel's house, where the
Concorde's passage overhead had been a daily highlight.
</P>
<P>
   The thunderous roar made by the world's only supersonic
passenger plane was so distinct that Girel could hear it long
before he could see it. ``A lot of my neighbors hate that sound _
that roar, really. But for me, it was a familiar comfort. It was a
sound of France.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a sound the French may not hear for a while. Air France
grounded its Concorde fleet indefinitely as government
investigators try to piece together what brought the elegant
aircraft to earth. It was the Concorde's first fatal accident in
the 31 years since its maiden flight.
</P>
<P>
   For many like Girel, the crash of what the French call ``the
great white bird'' signaled the passing of an era _ the death of a
great symbol.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde _ originally the dream of legendary leader Charles
de Gaulle _ long has been an important symbol not only of European
technology and design, but also of a success that is decidedly not
American.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the influential daily Le Figaro wrote that
the Concorde after three decades remained the envy of even the
Americans. ``In 2000, this plane, whose technology goes back to the
1960s, still incarnates modernity,'' the newspaper wrote. ``It also
represents genius of Europeans.''
</P>
<P>
   Andre Turcat, the test pilot who first flew the Concorde in 1969
is a national hero _ the French equivalent of America's Chuck
Yeager. The plane flown by Turcat is honored in a museum with the
machines of Louis Bleriot and other Gallic aeronautical pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where it has become painfully ordinary to have a
Big Mac combo for lunch washed down by a Coke, and then head home
to veg on the couch with reruns of ``Frazier'' and ``Friends,''
such symbols are few and far between.
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of Europeans, the Concorde represented more than a
symbol of European technical virility; it embodied the spirit of
triumph unbridled by a concern for the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, after all, killed their supersonic transport
because the insipid Yankee bean-counters in the 1960s deemed it
unprofitable. It took the visionary French _ and reluctant Britons
_ to persevere in the quest for the elegant super-fast aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   They built Concorde to prove a point _ the point being that they
could build it.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, it was our moon landing,'' Girel said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Concorde has had about the same commercial success
as a moon trip. With one-way tickets costing $5,000, the cramped
supersonic airliner has been steadily losing passengers to slower
but cheaper competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Also, like the space program, the Concorde was an idealistic
government product. French and British taxpayers spent about $2.5
billion to develop the aircraft, and only 16 were built. Three were
retired in recent years, leaving Britain's British Airways with
seven and France's Air France with six before the crash.
</P>
<P>
   In 24 years of passenger service, the Concorde held a flawless
safety record. But with technology more than 30 years old, the
remaining Concordes are scheduled to be taken out of scheduled
service by the end of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere in the world is a successor to the Concorde on the
drawing board. Boeing has lost interest in the idea, and European
aircraft manufacturer Airbus, the only other manufacturer capable
of building such a plane, is focusing on its triple-decker super
jumbo-jet the A3XX. It is expected to be the largest passenger
plane in the world with more than 650 seats.
</P>
<P>
   French experts have estimated that it would cost upwards of $25
billion to develop a 250-seat supersonic passenger plane _ twice as
much as the Airbus is investing in the A3XX.
</P>
<P>
   While France can claim other famous technical marvels such as
the TGV _ the train that speeds along at nearly 200 mph _ it is
easy to get the feeling here that the country is being left behind
technologically.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, which the French are eagerly embracing, is clearly
the domain of the United States, with up to 80 percent of European
Internet traffic routed across the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps seeking to recapture the mythic success of the Concorde,
France this year embarked on a quest to find its successor. The
government has funded 19 research projects, intended to gauge the
prospects of a post-Concorde project.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the nation must cope with this week's grim reality. The
nearly universal feeling among people on the street has been
profound grief for the people killed in the crash _ and a sense of
melancholy for the Concorde itself.
</P>
<P>
   Le Figaro, the French daily, put it this way the day after the
crash: ``Without doubt, Concorde died yesterday at the age of 31,''
Le Figaro said. ``For France this is a double day of mourning. All
that will remain is the myth of the beautiful white bird. The
Concorde represented a France which sought to convince itself that
it was still the center of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Andre Arnould, the owner of a small tobacco shop in Gonesse,
said on Friday that he has been depressed all week. ``I think it's
because the Concorde was so perfect, such an ideal _ and then to
crash, it hurts, really,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A myth crashed with the Concorde Tuesday, said the daily
Paris-Normandie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Symbol of triumphant technology, speed and luxury, European
know-how and competition with the United States, the plane
incarnates our end of the century.''

UPDATE: MP3, EMI REACH AGREEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by clients of The New York Times News Service) (Eds: Stock
figures are not up to the minute.) 
 By TIM ARANGO   
 c.2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Online music distributor MP3.com (MPPP:Nasdaq) reached a
settlement with another major record label, giving the former
adversary of the recording industry licensing agreements with three
of the five major record labels, the companies said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement will allow MP3.com to offer songs owned by EMI
for its My.MP3.com service. Major record label content was pulled
from the service in May pending resolution of the lawsuits. In
April, a judge found that the company violated copyright law. The
MyMP3.com service offers a digital locker in cyberspace where
people can store and download music for free _ but only if they own
the compact disc first.
</P>
<P>
   The service will not resume until MP3.com secures agreements
with all five major record labels, said Michael Robertson,
MP3.com's chief executive officer, in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com settled with Time Warner's (TWX:NYSE) Warner Music Group
and Bertelsmann's BMG Entertainment in early June. It still has
lawsuits pending with Seagram's (VO:NYSE) Universal Music Group and
Sony's (SNE:NYSE) Sony Music Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   In its recent quarter, the company took a $150 million charge,
money that was set aside to pay the costs of the legal battles. The
charge still gives the company about $150 million in cash,
Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   A settlement with Sony is not imminent, according to a source
close to that company. A representative from Universal could not be
immediately reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego-based MP3.com was off 3/4, or 7 percent, at 9 9/16.
Its 52-week high is 64 5/8.

&HT;     TIGER BURNS BRIGHT, EVEN WITH NON-GOLFERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By WILLIAM WONG  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One hates to be part of the herd, but I cannot help but add to
the
</P>
<P>
   chorus of golf writers and commentators who have run out of
superlatives to describe the Tiger Woods who made golf history last
weekend at the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, golf isn't something that excites me. I don't play, and
when
</P>
<P>
   Woods isn't playing, I don't watch golf tournaments on TV. When
he is playing, apparently a lot of people are like me. We watch.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the British Open, Woods was the odds-on favorite, and
he
</P>
<P>
   didn't disappoint. For a short while on Sunday, David Duval, the
world's
</P>
<P>
   second-rated golfer, gave Woods a run, causing Tiger fans some
moments of
</P>
<P>
   anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Then Duval's game fell apart in the final nine holes. Woods won
</P>
<P>
   comfortably.
</P>
<P>
   What is it about this 24-year-old prodigy _ other than the
youth, good
</P>
<P>
   looks, talent, intelligence, exemplary work ethic and wealth _
that
</P>
<P>
   fascinates me and many other non-golfers?
</P>
<P>
   After Woods won the Master's in April 1997, I wrote that,
whether he liked
</P>
<P>
   it or not, Woods had become an icon to both African Americans
and Asian
</P>
<P>
   Americans. Because he is a one-man United Nations, he had the
potential to
</P>
<P>
   bring together ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   Even in our celebrity-drenched culture, Woods holds a special
place. Few
</P>
<P>
   people or things promoted in the ubiquitous media live up to the
hype, but
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods does.
</P>
<P>
   After he won the Master's, golf writers anointed him the
successor to the
</P>
<P>
   great Jack Nicklaus. But Woods faltered somewhat until mid-1999,
when he
</P>
<P>
   worked out kinks in his stroke and his game turned around.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he had been favored to win each of the most recent
Grand Slam tournaments (the Master's, U.S. Open, British Open and
Professional Golf Association) and did win three of them.
</P>
<P>
   But has he brought fractious racial and ethnic groups in the
United
</P>
<P>
   States closer together? Hardly, but it was unrealistic of me or
anyone
</P>
<P>
   else to expect that of him.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Earl Woods, has been the most prominent proselytizer
of
</P>
<P>
   Tiger's messianic potential. At a dinner honoring Woods as
America's
</P>
<P>
   outstanding college golfer of 1996, Earl Woods said, ``This
young man is
</P>
<P>
   going to be able to help so many people. He will transcend this
game and
</P>
<P>
   bring to the world a humanitarianism which has never been known
before.
</P>
<P>
   The world will be a better place to live in by virtue of his
existence and
</P>
<P>
   his presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods has enriched himself, the men's golf tour, TV networks and
</P>
<P>
   corporations pay him to endorse their products. He has inspired
young
</P>
<P>
   people of different ethnic groups to try the game once thought
to be the
</P>
<P>
   exclusive preserve of rich white people.
</P>
<P>
   It appears, however, that the golfer himself isn't embracing the
mantle of
</P>
<P>
   world savior. As Sports Illustrated wrote in its April 3, 2000,
cover

 &HT;    FOR FRENCH, CRASH OF CONCORDE ALSO MARKS DEATH OF A GREAT SYMBOL
 &HT;    For Use Sun., July 30 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GONESSE, France _ Outside his creme-colored house on a quiet
flowered suburban street, Marc Girel trims his roses with an eye on
the cloud-filled sky.
</P>
<P>
   Every few minutes, a passenger jet flies over Girel's house from
Charles De Gaulle International Airport three miles away. The
68-year-old retired civil engineer takes pleasure in the sound _
some would say, noise _ made by the jets because of his lifelong
love affair with airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   But today, something is missing. ``It's not the same,'' he says,
after pausing with his clippers to watch a plane pass overhead. ``I
miss the Concorde.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, one of Air France's six supersonic Concordes crashed
less than two minutes after take-off, killing 114 people in a
violent white-hot explosion that disintegrated the aircraft and
incinerated a small hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The accident site is a short drive from Girel's house, where the
Concorde's passage overhead had been a daily highlight.
</P>
<P>
   The thunderous roar made by the world's only supersonic
passenger plane was so distinct that Girel could hear it long
before he could see it. ``A lot of my neighbors hate that sound _
that roar, really. But for me, it was a familiar comfort. It was a
sound of France.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a sound the French may not hear for a while. Air France
grounded its Concorde fleet indefinitely as government
investigators try to piece together what brought the elegant
aircraft to earth. It was the Concorde's first fatal accident in
the 31 years since its maiden flight.
</P>
<P>
   For many like Girel, the crash of what the French call ``the
great white bird'' signaled the passing of an era _ the death of a
great symbol.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde _ originally the dream of legendary leader Charles
de Gaulle _ long has been an important symbol not only of European
technology and design, but also of a success that is decidedly not
American.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the influential daily Le Figaro wrote that
the Concorde after three decades remained the envy of even the
Americans. ``In 2000, this plane, whose technology goes back to the
1960s, still incarnates modernity,'' the newspaper wrote. ``It also
represents genius of Europeans.''
</P>
<P>
   Andre Turcat, the test pilot who first flew the Concorde in 1969
is a national hero _ the French equivalent of America's Chuck
Yeager. The plane flown by Turcat is honored in a museum with the
machines of Louis Bleriot and other Gallic aeronautical pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where it has become painfully ordinary to have a
Big Mac combo for lunch washed down by a Coke, and then head home
to veg on the couch with reruns of ``Frazier'' and ``Friends,''
such symbols are few and far between.
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of Europeans, the Concorde represented more than a
symbol of European technical virility; it embodied the spirit of
triumph unbridled by a concern for the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, after all, killed their supersonic transport
because the insipid Yankee bean-counters in the 1960s deemed it
unprofitable. It took the visionary French _ and reluctant Britons
_ to persevere in the quest for the elegant super-fast aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   They built Concorde to prove a point _ the point being that they
could build it.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, it was our moon landing,'' Girel said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Concorde has had about the same commercial success
as a moon trip. With one-way tickets costing $5,000, the cramped
supersonic airliner has been steadily losing passengers to slower
but cheaper competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Also, like the space program, the Concorde was an idealistic
government product. French and British taxpayers spent about $2.5
billion to develop the aircraft, and only 16 were built. Three were
retired in recent years, leaving Britain's British Airways with
seven and France's Air France with six before the crash.
</P>
<P>
   In 24 years of passenger service, the Concorde held a flawless
safety record. But with technology more than 30 years old, the
remaining Concordes are scheduled to be taken out of scheduled
service by the end of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere in the world is a successor to the Concorde on the
drawing board. Boeing has lost interest in the idea, and European
aircraft manufacturer Airbus, the only other manufacturer capable
of building such a plane, is focusing on its triple-decker super
jumbo-jet the A3XX. It is expected to be the largest passenger
plane in the world with more than 650 seats.
</P>
<P>
   French experts have estimated that it would cost upwards of $25
billion to develop a 250-seat supersonic passenger plane _ twice as
much as the Airbus is investing in the A3XX.
</P>
<P>
   While France can claim other famous technical marvels such as
the TGV _ the train that speeds along at nearly 200 mph _ it is
easy to get the feeling here that the country is being left behind
technologically.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, which the French are eagerly embracing, is clearly
the domain of the United States, with up to 80 percent of European
Internet traffic routed across the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps seeking to recapture the mythic success of the Concorde,
France this year embarked on a quest to find its successor. The
government has funded 19 research projects, intended to gauge the
prospects of a post-Concorde project.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the nation must cope with this week's grim reality. The
nearly universal feeling among people on the street has been
profound grief for the people killed in the crash _ and a sense of
melancholy for the Concorde itself.
</P>
<P>
   Le Figaro, the French daily, put it this way the day after the
crash: ``Without doubt, Concorde died yesterday at the age of 31,''
Le Figaro said. ``For France this is a double day of mourning. All
that will remain is the myth of the beautiful white bird. The
Concorde represented a France which sought to convince itself that
it was still the center of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Andre Arnould, the owner of a small tobacco shop in Gonesse,
said on Friday that he has been depressed all week. ``I think it's
because the Concorde was so perfect, such an ideal _ and then to
crash, it hurts, really,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A myth crashed with the Concorde Tuesday, said the daily
Paris-Normandie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Symbol of triumphant technology, speed and luxury, European
know-how and competition with the United States, the plane
incarnates our end of the century.''

 iVILLAGE DROPS NEARLY 10 PERCENT ON WIDER-THAN-EXPECTED LOSS  
(For use by clients of The New York Times News Service) (Eds: Stock
figures are not up to the minute.) 
 By JENNIFER BAYOT   
 c.2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shares of iVillage (IVIL:Nasdaq) fell 10 percent Friday after
the women's Web site reported a wider-than-expected second-quarter
loss and said it would replace CEO Candice Carpenter with President
Doug McCormick.
</P>
<P>
   New York-based iVillage was off 21/32, or 10 percent, to 5 7/8.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter, one of the company's co-founders, will become
chairwoman on Aug. 1 and assist in developing iVillage's long-term
strategies of garnering global partnerships, building corporate
alliances and bringing the brand to other media.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is becoming more important to put a face on our brand to
help connect women to it,'' Carpenter said in a statement. ``In
addition to leveraging the brand in other media and forging
relationships, I am eager to spend more time in this role,
representing the brand to women here and around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Before joining iVillage two years ago, McCormick served as CEO
at Lifetime Television. During his six-year tenure there, he
created the programming and marketing strategy ``Television for
Women,'' credited with increasing the network's market value by $3
billion.
</P>
<P>
   iVillage posted a second-quarter net loss of $19.9 million, or
94 cents a share, vs. a loss of $15 million, or 63 cents a share,
in the same period a year ago. The figure excludes one-time charges
of $8.1 million related to iVillage's investment positions and $9.3
million from discontinued operations. Wall Street analysts had
expected a loss of 88 cents a share, according to First
Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue in the quarter tripled to $19.4 million from $6.4
million in the second quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   At June 30, iVillage had $77.8 million in cash, cash equivalents
and restricted cash on its balance sheet, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   iVillage.com features 16 channels that focus on issues like
fitness, money and parenting. iVillage provides interactive
services, peer support and online access to experts and tailored
shopping opportunities.

UPDATE: AVICI AIMS TO FIND RIGHT ROUTE IN NETWORKING MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by clients of The New York Times News Service) (Eds: Stock
figures are not up to the minute.) 
 By CAROLYN KOO   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ``vici''in Avici translates from Latin to ``I conquered,''
but Avici Systems (AVCI:Nasdaq), which went public on Friday, would
have to subdue both of its immense rivals, Cisco (CSCO:Nasdaq) and
Juniper Networks (JNPR:Nasdaq), before it could truly invoke Julius
Caesar's famed statement of braggadocio.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have been increasingly attracted to Internet
communications equipment makers, as the search for newer, faster
and better ways to negotiate the ever-burgeoning traffic on the Web
continues. Avici claims to take advantage of that trend with its
core router. A router is a device that connects computers and
computer systems, moving and directing traffic between them. Though
a newcomer to the market, Avici is betting that the technological
promise of its product will outweigh the company's rather sparse
financial statements in its debut.
</P>
<P>
   Avici, which is 16.6 percent owned by Nortel Networks (NT:NYSE),
leapt 223 percent, or 6 3/16, to 100 1/8 in its open.
</P>
<P>
   The public offering of 7 million shares was priced at $31 a
share Thursday night, raising $217 million.
</P>
<P>
   The IPO price reflected strong investor interest, since it was
well above the initial range of $18 to $20 a share. However, that
price range was raised to $28 to $30 earlier this week when the
size of the offering was increased from 6 million shares. Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter is the lead underwriter of the offering.
</P>
<P>
   Avici's Competition
</P>
<P>
   Avici is trying to break into a networking market currently
controlled by two companies. With a market share of just over 80
percent, Cisco dominates. And Juniper follows, holding a 15 percent
to nearly 20 percent market share.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the market is expected to expand to about $12 billion
by 2003, from an estimated $1.5 billion this year and more than
$600 million last year, according to telecommunications research
firm RHK. ``That's why everyone and their uncle is trying to get
into the market,'' says Raj Mehta, an analyst at RHK.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, more competition coming from Alcatel
(ALA:NYSE) and Lucent (LU:NYSE) (which bought Avici's rival,
Nexabit Networks, last year), as well as from privately held
Charlotte's Web Networks, IronBridge Networks and Pluris.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all ties into market opportunity and the need for a data
infrastructure. We have at least five years of build-out ahead of
us,'' Mehta said. ``There's such a massive need for new equipment.
The router is the basic building block of that infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   Still in Its Infancy
</P>
<P>
   Avici, based in the Boston suburb of North Billerica, Mass., has
a tiny slice of market share of less than 1 percent. But its
product only became commercially available in the fourth quarter of
1999. The company says its terabit switch router can move traffic
with greater power and at higher speeds than its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   There's little evidence yet of Avici's claims, since the company
has only one customer, GST Telecommunications (GSTX:Nasdaq), which
recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
   Its product, however, is in trials with Williams Communications
Group (WCG:NYSE) and Enron (ENE:NYSE) subsidiary Enron Broadband
Services. Williams and Enron both happen to be Avici stockholders.
(Enron switched from using Cisco equipment.) Should the trials _
first in a laboratory and then in a live network _ be successful,
Williams and Enron have committed to buy $45 million of Avici
equipment through 2001. Those trials can take the better part of a
year, according to Martin Pyykkonen, an analyst at CIBC World
Markets. He rates Cisco a buy and Juniper a strong buy, and his
firm has no underwriting relationship with Cisco, Juniper or Avici.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T (T:NYSE) has completed laboratory testing of the terabit
switch router and will soon enter field trials, which should be
completed by the end of 2000, according to Avici's initial public
offering registration statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Compatibility Is Key
</P>
<P>
   Another important technical point concerns the software
component of Avici's product. It is crucial that Avici's core
router be compatible, or interoperate, with Cisco's and, to a
lesser extent, Juniper's routers because of their predominance in
existing networks.
</P>
<P>
   Pyykkonen questioned whether Avici's software is sufficiently
developed for compatibility because if not, it could take some time
to do so. ``Cisco operates three-quarters of the Internet backbone
technology,'' Pyykkonen said. ``Avici's product needs to
interoperate with Cisco gear at the software level. It took a two-
to three-year research and development effort from Juniper to get
their code up to speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehta of RHK conceded that Avici's software is still maturing,
but he is convinced that it is on track to becoming ``stable and
reliable. We don't have performance metrics, but we expect it to be
very competitive,'' he continued. ``We participated in a live
trial, so we have firsthand expectations.'' That trial took place
in April.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers Crunch
</P>
<P>
   Though the company's technology is encouraging, its numbers are
not. After filing for its IPO on May 18, Avici has been cautious
about bringing its shares to market, ``the reason being the current
market environment is no longer disposed to look kindly upon
startups with meager revenues and small customer bases,'' said
Yusuf Haque, an analyst at financial portal 123Jump.com.
</P>
<P>
   Like many companies that have gone public, the company sustained
a loss, of $16.7 million, on sales of $504,000, in the quarter
ended March 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bit of a leap of faith to go public with no hard
revenue,'' said David Toung, an analyst at Argus Research. He rates
both Cisco and Juniper a buy and his firm does not participate in
underwriting.
</P>
<P>
   But Avici's financial position may not even matter. Pyykkonen
said that it is unlikely to dampen investor enthusiasm for the
company's shares, especially with Juniper just crossing into
profitability in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999. ``There's a
huge gap between credibility and investor perception for
dot-coms,'' he said. ``But in this space, the models are pretty
well established. The path to profitability is pretty clear and
institutional investors understand that path.''
</P>
<P>
   The financial outlook is also somewhat positive, with $2.2
million in sales expected for the quarter ended June 30. But the
company's loss is expected to grow to $26 million to $27.2 million.
``With positive gross margins and sales growing faster than
expenses, the company is moving closer to profits than Corio
(CRIO:Nasdaq), which pulled in a successful initial public offering
last week,'' said George Nichols, a stock analyst at
Morningstar.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crucial variable to watch on first-day trading will be
volumes,'' Haque said. A low volume, under 10 million, is a good
indication that IPO investors are keen to hold onto the stock in
the aftermarket, he said. ``Consider also that optical networking
IPOs are often highly valued, and the investor temptation to flip
on the first day may be too much to resist if the price begins to
skyrocket,'' Haque continued. ``This, therefore, may be a highly
volatile stock for the few days subsequent to the pricing.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, the stock ``should have a great opening, but there's not
much business to value right now, beyond the firm's promising
technology,'' Nichols said. ``Until Avici expands beyond one
customer and one product, valuing its stock will be more art than
science.''

 &HT;    RUSSIA'S PUTIN DECLARES ERA OF 'OLIGARCHS' OVER
 &HT;    (700&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    With list of oligarchs attached at end of story.
 &HT;    By MARGARET COKER 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to a truce
Friday with the country's top tycoons, promising to spare them
government investigation into their alleged wrongdoing, but warning
that the era of their excessive political and financial influence
had come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   In a closed-door Kremlin meeting with 21 so-called
``oligarchs,'' Putin promised not to overturn the privatization
deals from the mid-1990s that made them fabulously wealthy at the
expense of the country as a whole. At the same time, he told them
that they were responsible to help lift Russia's economic doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   However, analysts said the meeting was aimed at overhauling the
oligarch's pecking order _ not reforming the system that has
crippled Russia's investment climate and caused rampant poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (the oligarch meeting) was a play produced for public
consumption, not necessarily a reflection of reality. Many
questions remain (like whether) the show was just a cover for
installing new, more Putin-friendly, oligarchs, and whether the
business climate will actually improve because of this,'' said
Peter Ekman, a Moscow-based financial commentator.
</P>
<P>
   During Russia's 1996 presidential elections, the oligarchs
emerged as political and financial heavyweights when they agreed to
throw their wealth and media resources behind then-President Boris
Yeltsin in his battle against a strong Communist challenger.
</P>
<P>
   After Yeltsin's re-election, these tycoons grew even richer from
their access to the Kremlin, which allowed them to participate in
and win lucrative privatization deals and circumvent national laws
and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian public hates these businessmen for the way they
acquired their wealth while the country was collapsing,'' said
Yevgeny Volk, the head of the Heritage Foundation in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Putin had invited a select group of these business leaders to
the Kremlin Friday after a spate of unprecedented attacks by his
government on many of the oligarchs' businesses. For example,
federal officials arrested _ and temporarily jailed _ media mogul
Vladimir Gusinsky, after raiding the offices of several of his
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who was elected in March, pledged to make all equal
before the government and the law, and the ensuing police actions
have been interpreted by some as the government's effort to show
the tycoons their place.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of the Friday meeting, the businessmen expected a
kiss-and-make-up session. Putin appeared to concede on their main
concern, that the government would revise privatization results and
leave them penniless.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president said again that the government would not review
the results of privatization. At the same time he made clear that
from now on, government structures would not aid businesses in
their work or battles,'' government spokeswoman Natalya Timakova
said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, as customary, did not make a public statement, preferring
to work through his press service.
</P>
<P>
   For all of Putin's sharp words, businessmen left the Kremlin in
smiles. Mikhail Khordokovsky, who owns Russia's third-largest oil
company, told reporters that many issues had been cleared up during
the two-hour, 40-minute meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have hints on how we have to deal with the government
in the future. We were told what the rules of the game are (under
Putin,)'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Potanin, who controls Russia's largest
telecommunications company and has been accused of tax evasion,
told reporters that the era of oligarchs ``was over.''
</P>
<P>
   However, other evidence exists that indeed it is not.
</P>
<P>
   While the Kremlin has opened tax evasion cases against many
leading businessmen in recent weeks, many notable tycoons have
escaped official scrutiny. In fact, men like Roman Abramovich and
Oleg Derikpasa have seen their empires grow under the Putin regime
under questionable circumstances similar to the Yeltsin-era
privatization deals.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that Putin's words would soon be put to the test,
when the results of the latest government sale of a state-owned oil
company is announced Sept. 18. Rumors are already flying that
Abramovich has fixed the privatization deal, and will win the
tender without competition.

BUSH GETS HIS CHANCE TO SHOW HE'S `READY' 
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   This has been something of a rollercoaster year for George W.
Bush. Last autumn, his nomination as the Republican presidential
candidate seemed inevitable: the governor of Texas boasted a decent
record, a likeable character, a well-known name, a new slogan
(''compassionate conservatism'') and the most formidable money
machine modern politics has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the McCain insurgency; by February Bush had quashed
the turbulent senator, but only by spending virtually all his
$70-million treasure trove and losing a good deal of both his
likeability and his moderateness. A snarling right-winger, he won
his party's nomination, but had apparently handed the November
election to Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the Republican convention beckoning next week in
Philadelphia, Bush has repainted himself once again. The
likeability is back; so is much of the moderation; and he has added
considerably more depth to the portrait.
</P>
<P>
   For the past four months, the supposedly lightweight Bush has
dominated the presidential campaign, unfurling policy after policy
and surrounding himself with serious-looking advisers; meanwhile,
Gore, the supposed policy wonk, has seemed stuck in a series of
tired relaunches.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is slightly ahead in the polls; and unless something
terrible happens at what promises to be a heavily overscripted
convention, he can expect to increase his lead.
</P>
<P>
   Where does this leave Bush? In with a real chance. Of course,
Gore will get his own post-nomination bounce in the polls after the
Democratic convention later in August. When it matters, in
November, the vice president may have the edge: Gore has the
incumbent's benefit of a remarkably strong economy (so far) and he
is an impressively brutal debater, whereas Bush's showing against
McCain was dismal.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how endearing Bush seems at the podium next Thursday
night, the appeal of his new self-portrait will not really be
tested until his televised contests with Gore in October.
</P>
<P>
   With that caveat, there is still plenty to be said _ much of it
good _ about the Bush who comes to Philadelphia. Those who worry
about him tend to bring up two charges. They are the ones that
dogged the rise to the presidency of another western conservative
governor, Ronald Reagan. Bush is said to be too extreme and lacking
the intellectual capacity to be president. Those charges ring
hollow.
</P>
<P>
   On some counts, Bush does seem too conservative. He has been a
strong opponent of gun control, something that will deservedly do
him few favors with women voters. Texas also has a poor
environmental record, which Gore will blame, not altogether
unfairly, on Bush's ties to the energy industry.
</P>
<P>
   And, despite the popularity of the death penalty in the United
States, Bush's record as a serial executioner may come back to
haunt him, particularly if it becomes clear that some innocent
people have been executed.
</P>
<P>
   Probably none of these issues will cost Bush the election. The
previous Republican candidate, Bob Dole, lost his way with
independent voters, the ``soccer moms'' of lore, by seeming
socially illiberal yet fiscally profligate. On the key social issue
of abortion, Bush may have done just enough to win himself a pass.
Officially, he has stuck to the anti-abortion record of the
Christian right; but there have been enough nods and winks to guess
that Bush, like his father, would not strive hard to outlaw it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on taxes, the economy is helping. Like Dole, Bush put
forward a big tax cut. The new predictions for future budget
surpluses have not only made that seem a bit less reckless;
crucially, they have encouraged Gore to offer a big cut of his own.
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, Bush can claim to be a genuine reformer in
the vital matter of education. It would be better if he openly
campaigned for vouchers; but he is a far keener proponent of
structural reform in the public-school system than Gore, who is
firmly on the side of the teachers' unions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has also been much braver about Social Security: Unlike
Gore, he would allow people to invest some of their public pension
in the stockmarket. Compassionate conservatism also introduces
fresh ideas about making more use of the private sector and
churches in helping America's poor.
</P>
<P>
   In foreign policy, too, Bush deserves some credit. He has been
more solid than Gore on free trade. There are question marks about
his grip of the missile-defense debate, and more generally of basic
facts about the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   But the man who once called Greeks ``Grecians'' has tried to
bone up on the issues and to provide himself with competent
advisers. A Bush administration with Richard Cheney as vice
president and perhaps Colin Powell as secretary of state would be a
force to be reckoned with abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Take these policies, add Bush's long record of working together
with the Democrats in Texas and his Reaganesque record of picking
good advisers, and he surely has a plausible candidacy. Of course,
one can wish for more _ much more.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike McCain, Bush will not shake up Washington's lamentable
system of money politics. On the other hand, there is precious
little hope of Gore doing so either. Bush may not be the perfect
candidate; but now his challenge is merely to prove he is a better
one than the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Purely in terms of the policies, Bush is certainly ready for
that comparison. But the next three months will probably be even
more about character: not just intellect, but temperament. The
American people, most of whom have paid scant attention to the
events so far, will have to get used to Bush, and to trust him.
</P>
<P>
   This was the part of the test that that other supposedly
ignorant western governor, Reagan, passed so triumphantly 20 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans may decide whether Bush is ``ready'' in this
sense only when they come to pull the lever on Nov. 7. Philadelphia
offers his first real chance to convince them that he is.

CHENEY ADDS LITTLE TO THE TICKET AND DETRACTS LESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: Commentary Editors - This is ``Lexington'' column)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 From The Economist magazine

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   When George W. Bush first described the running mate he wanted,
he said his choice would be ``electrifying.'' It ``would make your
eyes light up.''
</P>
<P>
   That was when his campaign wanted a bright new face _ someone
who would reshape the political landscape and epitomize the
generational change by moving the Republican Party away from those
ghastly people in Congress. Evidently Bush has now had second
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney is a rock-solid candidate, with all the charisma of
that inorganic substance. He fulfills the Hippocratic requirements
of a vice president (''First, do no harm''). He will not
contradict, embarrass or outshine Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Vice presidents are sometimes required to be the campaign's
attack dog. Cheney is easy-going, civil and patient, more like a
guide dog for the blind than the Hound of the Baskervilles.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, those may prove useful qualities. Cheney has
managed to play influential roles in Washington for a quarter of a
century _ most recently as defense secretary for Bush's father and
before that as No.2 in the Republican Party's hierarchy in the
House _ without making too many enemies in his own party (both
wings of which applauded this week's choice) or even among
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In picking his running mate, it was the cautious side of Bush's
personality that came to the fore.
</P>
<P>
   Caution has limitations as well as merits. One of Cheney's
advantages is that he seems to be no slash-and-burn Republican, no
Newt Gingrich. But note how he comes by this reputation: as a
leader of the generation that preceded the Republican revolution of
1994, not the one still recovering from it. When Cheney left
Congress to join President Bush's cabinet, the man who stepped into
his job as House minority whip was none other than the gentleman
from Georgia, Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney finally ends the Gingrich revolution. He brings the party
full circle. Personifying the status quo ante, he backs up Bush's
claim to be a new kind of Republican only if you think that going
back a political generation counts as going forward.
</P>
<P>
   But Cheney does fulfill the two other requirements Bush made
when he drew up the vice-presidential job specifications: that he
could step into the president's shoes if need be, and that he
should get along well with Bush personally. Even here, though, he
does so in ways that have a downside.
</P>
<P>
   To say that Cheney is qualified to take over the presidency is
putting it mildly. In terms of executive experience, he is probably
the running mate best qualified to be president in modern times. He
was in the Oval Office at a daunting time in recent White House
history _ when Gerald Ford set about rebuilding the executive
branch of government after the disasters of Watergate (Ford picked
Cheney to be his White House chief of staff at the ripe age of 34).
More recently, he actually served as defense secretary during a
war: the one in the Gulf, in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has borrowed this splendid curriculum vitae to provide
himself with some surrogate gravitas and instant credibility in
foreign affairs. This is widely seen in America as a smart campaign
move. For the rest of the world it could prove more than that.
</P>
<P>
   Bush himself brings _ how to put this politely? _ no great
burden of preconception about the world's affairs. His
foreign-policy advisers do not lack for experience; but they also
include more than the normal ration of people who want to make some
radical changes in foreign and military policy (step forward
Richard Perle, Ronald Reagan's Soviet-squashing ``prince of
darkness''). Having a relatively cautious old buffer around to wag
a wary paw is obviously an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if the president himself is relying partly on the
foreign-policy judgments of others, Cheney's prudence and rather
mainstream hawkishness may not be enough. Especially when dealing
with new strategic threats, America may need a vice president who
can stand up and shove Bush in one direction or another _ and it is
not clear that Cheney would do that. This is one area where you
might want the vice president to bark more forcefully.
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said for the other quality that got Cheney
picked: loyalty. Even by the paranoid standards of American
politics, Bush insists on and inspires undivided allegiance. He
said a big reason for picking Cheney was his confidence that he
could work well with him, a judgment based partly on Cheney's
service with Bush's father. The younger Bush was disgusted by the
people who abandoned the elder one in the latter days of that
troubled presidency. Loyalty, argues the governor of Texas, is the
glue that keeps his campaign staff a successful unit.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, loyalty has much to commend it. Bush's team remained
remarkably undivided even during the dark days (for them) of the
McCain insurgency. But so much is loyalty prized in this circle
that there is a real danger that Bush will shut himself off from
the variety and richness of views that comes from getting
conflicting advice.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Eisenhower, the modern president with the greatest
organizational experience, once said: ``I know of only one way in
which you can be sure you have done your best to make a wise
decision. You must get courageous men of strong views, and let them
debate with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not the Bush style. He surrounds himself with
long-serving allies. Many of them are no doubt highly capable
people. But there is a danger that they are too similar for Bush's
own good. Cheney, who until this week was the chief executive of
Halliburton, is even an oilman too.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is that the Bush campaign, even more than most, will
rise and fall on the candidate's own qualities. Cheney's lack of a
dowry in the form of votes from his home state expresses this
nicely (most of his political career was in Wyoming, which has a
grand total of three electoral-college votes, and where Democrats
are anyway on the endangered-species list).
</P>
<P>
   He adds little to the ticket and detracts less. The real lesson
from the Cheney nomination concerns Bush's growing self-confidence.
The name at the head of the ticket is the only one that matters.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything else, the choice of Cheney says that the
governor of Texas thinks he can win this li'l election all on his
own.

POST-SUMMIT TALK MORE CONDUCIVE TO GUNFIRE THAN NEGOTIATION

<P>
   Their return from Camp David was markedly different. Yasser
Arafat came home a hero, absorbing praise for not having buckled to
Israeli and American pressure. Ehud Barak came back to a crumbled
government, angrily blaming the collapse of the 15-day summit on
Arafat. The Palestinian, he said, had failed to make the ``historic
decisions necessary to end the conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's reply is simple. ``The Arab leader has not been born
who would give up Jerusalem,'' he reportedly told Bill Clinton
during a heated exchange.
</P>
<P>
   It was Jerusalem that unravelled the negotiations, though the
Palestinians say there were also no firm agreements on the right of
return of the Palestinian refugees, or where the borders of a
future Palestinian state would lie.
</P>
<P>
   The news blackout that persisted through the summit has turned
into storytelling. The Palestinians say Barak was offering them
sovereignty over several districts on the edge of Jerusalem's
municipal borders _ Israeli sources say these included Beit Hanina,
Kalandia and Shuafatin _ in return for Israel annexing three large
Jewish settlements, Maale Edumim, Gush Etzion and Givat Zeev, and
making them part of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   In the Old City and areas adjacent to it, the offer was
apparently ``broad civilian and administrative autonomy'' over
Palestinian neighborhoods, including the Muslim and Christian
quarters within the Old City, and ``signs of sovereignty'' at the
Dome of the Rock. Israel would retain ``residual sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   By Israeli standards, these are far-reaching concessions. Barak
described on July 25 how he had offered Arafat a redrawn, and in
effect divided, Jerusalem. Clinton went out of his way to praise
him for his ``very bold decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is barely any Arab leader who could have countenanced
these new arrangements, let alone Arafat. Apart from its numerous
Muslim and Christian shrines, the Old City is home to 37,000
Palestinians, against 3,000 Jews. And like the rest of East
Jerusalem, in international law it is occupied territory.
</P>
<P>
   The depressing thing is that since the talks did not lead to a
deal, all the positions taken at Camp David are now ``null and
void.'' Although they broke important taboos, they will not, at
least in theory, be the point of departure for future talks.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, like Barak, put his name to a statement reasserting that
negotiations based on United Nations resolutions were the only way
to reach an agreement, and committing the two sides to avoid
unilateral actions that prejudge the outcome of talks.
</P>
<P>
   This was a signal to Israel to ease up on settlement
construction. But mainly it was a message to Arafat about his
declared intention, endorsed by the PLO's Central Council earlier
this month, to announce a state by Sept. 13, the deadline both
sides have accepted for reaching a final agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Alive to the consequences of a unilateral declaration _ Barak
has said Israel would respond with unilateral steps of its own,
possibly annexing settlements, and America's Congress is preparing
laws to stop all aid _ Arafat is anxious to find some way out.
Doing nothing is probably not an option.
</P>
<P>
   But if negotiations on an interim deal could restart, Arafat
might be able to fudge the statehood declaration in exchange for
Israeli recognition of a Palestinian state in principle, and
another swathe of West Bank territory.
</P>
<P>
   For the ``third redeployment'' that is still owed the
Palestinians under the Oslo accords, Arafat, who now controls only
40 percent of the West Bank, has asked for another 45 percent.
Benjamin Netanyahu, when he was Israel's prime minister, offered 1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative to negotiations could be grim. Israeli
intelligence experts believe that with the West Bank and Gaza now
convolutedly carved up between the Palestinian Authority and the
Israeli army and settlers, a declaration of independence by Arafat
would trigger widespread and violent demonstrations that could
quickly grow into wholesale military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   If his armed policemen side with the demonstrators, as they have
done in isolated incidents in the past, Arafat would have a hard
job quelling the clashes even if he wanted to.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army issued machineguns and sniper rifles to
settlers in the northern West Bank this week, and urged them to
help with fencing and fortification work around their settlements.
The chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, gave warning that if a
body of Palestinian civilians marched on any settlement, the army
would regard this as a mortal danger to Israeli citizens.
</P>
<P>
   With this kind of talk in the air, the post-summit atmosphere in
Israel is hardly conducive to reopening negotiations. Barak, in a
somber address to ``the citizens of Israel'' from Frederick, Md.,
on Tuesday, seemed to anticipate violent times ahead. We will know
how to unite, he said, as we have so many times in the past.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Barak urgently needs to shore up his ragged government. He
prefers to do so with parties of the center, or even the right,
rather than try to rule with a minority leftist coalition dependent
on the votes of the Arab parties.
</P>
<P>
   But if peace talks with the Palestinians continue to dominate
the government's agenda, the parties that abandoned him before Camp
David _ Shas, the National Religious Party, and the Russian
immigrant party Yisrael B'Aliyah _ are unlikely to agree to return.
Even more damning, in the eyes of these parties, is the gradual
emergence of Barak's position on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Key members of the Likud, the main opposition party, said they
would rather leave the party than participate in a Labour-Likud
coalition under Barak. Wednesday, the Likud leader, Ariel Sharon,
promised publicly that he would not enter into such an arrangement
_ although several of his colleagues maintain that he would if
Barak asked him.
</P>
<P>
   On the prime minister's left, the Meretz Party, and possibly
some members of his own Labor Party, would turn against him if he
struck a deal with the Likud.
</P>
<P>
   Peaceniks in Israel are trying to find consolation in the fact
that Israel's decades-long, dogmatic insistence that Jerusalem is
non-negotiable has now been irrevocably punctured. Barak spoke
approvingly of the debate that the summit has generated inside
Israeli society over what parts of the area that Israel arbitrarily
defined as Jerusalem in 1967 are in fact of overwhelming national
importance to the Jewish state and Jewish identity.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that the Palestinian state, too, can have its capital
in parts of Jerusalem has been put on the table. Clinton says it
needs time for the idea to percolate among both nations. But the
clock, as Clinton also noted, is ticking against us all.

   Maybe they should take tips from the leaders of millennial
cults. They aren't yet predicting the apocalypse, but the heads of
government who gather each year at the G8 summit do tend to make
startling pledges.
</P>
<P>
   As the most powerful people in the world (the leaders of the
seven big industrial democracies plus Russia, together with the
president of the European Commission), they promise every summer to
tackle some of its worst troubles: poverty, disease, warfare, crime
and pollution, to name but a few.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a year on, they face the occupational hazard of humbler
soothsayers everywhere: how to explain to their followers why
nothing much has changed.
</P>
<P>
   At this year's summit in Okinawa between July 21 and July 23,
they found an answer: say it all again with feeling, plus Internet
initiatives. But respect tradition as well.
</P>
<P>
   That is presumably why their communique was laced as usual with
the anesthetizing gunk of globocratese _ ``partnership among
stakeholders,'' ``step changes,'' ``cultural diversity,'' even
``deeper peace of mind.''.
</P>
<P>
   On a more concrete level _ what had actually been done since
last year _ there was less to say. The leaders could only
``reaffirm'' last year's big idea: to speed up the Heavily Indebted
Poor Countries (HIPC) scheme, meant to cut the debts of 41 of the
world's poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   When they met in Cologne a year ago, the G8 set as a target that
25 of these countries should receive debt relief by the end of this
year. So far only nine have qualified, and of those, only one _
Uganda _ has reached ``completion point,'' making it eligible for
cancellation of some of its debt. The others have reached
``decision point,'' allowing them partial relief.
</P>
<P>
   The delays can partly be blamed on the poor countries' own
corruption or war-mongering. But some, such as Tanzania, one of the
nine qualifiers, complain that last year's decision to make HIPC
``broader, deeper and faster'' actually increased the number of
hoops they have to jump through.
</P>
<P>
   This year's new idea, meriting its own ``Okinawa Charter,'' is
that something must be done about the ``digital divide'' caused by
unequal access to information technology. The leaders agreed to
establish a ``Digital Opportunity Taskforce'' _ yes, ``dotforce'' _
to help spread the wonders of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   They are right to worry about the potential for technology to
widen the gulf between rich and poor. But it is hard to dispel the
impression that the main thing was to give the summiteers something
new to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   In more measurable promises, of more immediate import to the
world's poorest people, the leaders endorsed specific targets and
timetables for the spread of primary education (to be universal by
2015) and the eradication of diseases (deaths from TB, for
instance, to be cut by half, and HIV/AIDS-infection among young
people to be reduced by 25 percent by 2010). It would be wonderful
if these could be met. A number of global initiatives are in the
works. Progress reports next year!
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible not to mock when governments skirt politically
difficult issues such as trade liberalization in favor of bland
generalities. Or when they fearlessly proclaim unpopular truths
such as: ``Every child deserves a good education''; or ``Health is
key to prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   They even addressed aging _ oddly failing to pledge that they
would wipe it out by 2020, and instead plunging further into
controversy by promising to ``promote a culture that values the
experience and knowledge that comes with age.'' That was brave.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders said they would keep in touch (by e-mail, of course)
between now and the 2001 summit in Genoa. It is the least they can
do now that ``a new era dawns''; it is probably also the most they
will do.
</P>
<P>
   How about using this exciting new channel of communication to
concentrate next year's agenda on action, not self-indulgent
blather? Alternatively, how about abandoning this sorry exercise
altogether?

FORMER CIA WHISTLEBLOWER IN CUBA DOT-COM VENTURE  
 &HT;

<P>
   The forbidden fruit always tastes the best _ or so Philip Agee,
a former CIA whistleblower, is hoping. He has set up a
joint-venture dot.com company with Fidel Castro's government to
encourage Americans to defy their government by holidaying on the
forbidden island.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the U.S. House of Representatives has voted to soften
the travel ban to Cuba, the prospect of their actually making the
trip seems less implausible.
</P>
<P>
   Agee's Web site, called Cubalinda.com and designed for the
American market, offers travellers an ``unforgettable adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   The thrill, he assured potential clients ahead of next week's
Havana carnival, would be provided by the exotic dancers and
festival floats, rather than the firm hand of an immigration
official on the shoulder when visitors returned to the United
States after breaking the travel ban against the island.
</P>
<P>
   Agee has been a thorn in the Americans' side ever since he left
the CIA at the end of the 1960s to write books denouncing the
United States for dirty wars across Latin America. Now he wants to
further a rebellion against the American embargo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see people ignore the law,'' he says. ``That's
what happened in the 1920s with prohibition; all our grandfathers
were making bathtub gin.''
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, American law bans the spending of any money in
Cuba, rather than visits outright. Exceptions are made for
academics, students, musicians and others who can get special
permits. Some institutions, like Harvard University, have general
licenses allowing any member to visit Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could join a photo club in Maine online, which has a
general license,'' explains Agee, ``and then legally come to take
pictures of the carnival.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans say that more than 160,000 American citizens visited
the island last year, many of them legally.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the response to his Web site so far, there is plenty
of potential interest. Agee says he got more than 600,000 clicks
during its first three months. Not all the messages were friendly,
however, particularly those from exiles in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Americans have begun to hint at an easing of the
sanctions that have been in place for the last 38 years, it may be
that adventurous American sorts will feel readier to take the risk
right away.
</P>
<P>
   Cubalinda insists that even now there is no real risk for
American visitors. ``To our knowledge, no one has ever been
prosecuted for simply visiting Cuba,'' it declares. ``It is simply
a law designed to intimidate, but it is not enforced.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Agee himself, he makes no apologies for advocating a
breaking of the travel ban. ``I stayed away from the United States
for 17 years on legal advice,'' he says. ``If I find I can't go
back now, it will not bother me in the least.''

TELECOM TYCOON AIMS TO WIN POWER IN THAILAND  
 &HT;    
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
   From The Economist magazine  
 c.2000 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   It is too soon to write off Thaksin Shinawatra, the telecom
tycoon who wants to rule Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   His new party suffered a blow last Sunday, when Bangkok's voters
turned out in droves to choose a new governor. His candidate
managed to push the man from the ruling Democrat Party into third
place. But she lost heavily to Samak Sundaravej, a veteran
conservative whom most people seemed to think could get something
done about the capital's many problems.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Thaksin is hoping that the parliamentary elections, which
must be called later this year, will be a very different story.
</P>
<P>
   They may be. Since forming the Thai Rak Thai party in 1998,
Thaksin has emerged as the main threat to Chuan Leekpai and the
ruling Democrats. Chuan became prime minister in November 1997 and
has done well to last this long, given the notoriously short
lifespan of Thai governments and the unwieldy seven-party coalition
with which he started.
</P>
<P>
   But a spate of no-confidence motions, a walkout by a large
number of opposition MPs last month in an attempt to force an
earlier general election and some controversial reforms leave his
government vulnerable to opposition attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Thaksin, who stands on a pro-business platform, has been
sharpening his knives.
</P>
<P>
   Winning the governor's election in Bangkok would have been the
ideal start. In any event, Samak's toughness and previous
experience in government won the day. But his party is a local
affair.
</P>
<P>
   Thaksin has good reason to be more optimistic about the national
elections, where the advantages of incumbency and mass campaigning
benefit big parties. To compete better with the Democrats, Thaksin
has convinced more than 100 MPs from smaller parties to defect to
his Thai Rak Thai party.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these faces from the past may undermine his fresh,
reforming image. So, too, might widespread accusations that he is
paying MPs to change sides. Nevertheless, he is betting that their
political connections in the upcoming election will be invaluable.
</P>
<P>
   The poll will be the first national one to be held under the new
1997 constitution and monitored by a new electoral commission. In
theory this should make it easier for unknown candidates to win
seats.
</P>
<P>
   The new commission showed some toughness in Thailand's
first-ever Senate elections in March, when it disqualified several
candidates for campaign violations such as vote-buying, and ordered
many reruns. But the commission may not dare to act as bravely
during a general election.
</P>
<P>
   Sunai Phasuk, an academic with the Asian Network for Free
Elections, says a tough electoral commission will be essential for
an honest and free poll, but he does not expect it to bare its
teeth and eliminate cheating candidates entirely. He points out
that around a quarter of the 200 new senators who were elected were
disqualified in one of the earlier rounds, but nevertheless
eventually prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   If Thailand's voters do reject incumbent politicians in favor of
fresh faces, it will mark a genuine break with the past. But unless
that happens it looks as if the Democrats and Thai Rak Thai will
emerge as the two main forces in the new parliament.
</P>
<P>
   That would open the door for a frantic scramble to gain the
support of smaller parties. This being Thailand, there are bound to
be plenty of scandals along the way.

IS JAPAN'S REAL ESTATE MARKET AT LAST NEARING A BOTTOM?  
 &HT;    
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
   From The Economist magazine  
 c.2000 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   For all the fickleness of Japan's stop-and-go economic
performance over the last ten years, the economy has had one
reliable feature: falling property prices. Since 1990, the value of
Japanese real estate has plunged by over 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Tokyo, commercial property has shed more than three-quarters
of its value. This deflationary wrecking ball is still hard at
work. Leading a nasty selloff of Japanese shares this week were the
same companies that have haunted the market ever since the property
bubble burst: construction firms, property developers and the banks
that financed their now-crumbling empires.
</P>
<P>
   At last, though, a glimmer of light is intruding on the gloom.
Refreshingly, it does not come from the usual quick fixes that are
favored by the government _ public land purchases, accounting
tricks and bail-outs. Rather, Japan is aiming its new reforms
squarely at the market's more deep-seated financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   Bank loans finance almost all Japanese property purchases. The
poor health of their customers and the sorry state of their own
finances have, however, put banks off property loans. So developers
have no money for new investments. Japan hopes to break this
gridlock with new financial tools, imported from America's
sophisticated capital markets.
</P>
<P>
   One much-trumpeted development is the arrival of commercial
mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), bonds serviced out of the
proceeds of property loans, and secured on the value of commercial
property and the rent that it produces.
</P>
<P>
   For lenders, these bonds have one big advantage over ordinary
property loans. They are traded in a secondary market, which
attracts pension funds and other investors.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowers, meanwhile, can finance their property development
``off balance sheet'': beneficial ownership of a building and the
debt that financed it are transferred to a separate company
specially set up for the purpose. In this way, they can tidy up
their balance sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, in part, the attraction in Japan, where big, heavily
indebted property developers such as Sumitomo Realty have started
using the CMBS market to trim their borrowings.
</P>
<P>
   Moodys, an American credit-rating agency, expects new CMBS
issues this year of as much as 700 billion yen ($6.4 billion), more
than four times the amount sold last year, when the first CMBS
issue appeared.
</P>
<P>
   CMBS issues can be backed not just by healthy mortgages but also
by pools of non-performing property loans, of which there is no
shortage in Japan. Pioneering this part of the market are American
investors such as Cerberus, Lonestar, Morgan Stanley and Goldman
Sachs, which have been quietly buying deeply discounted portfolios
of non-performing loans from the banks. Industry sources say these
foreigners have invested $7 billion to $10 billion in such loans.
</P>
<P>
   Provoking even louder cheers is the pending introduction of
real-estate investment trusts (REITs), perhaps early next year. A
REIT is a specialized property investor. Like CMBS issues, REITs
offer holders of their securities the comfort of secondary trading:
their shares are listed on the stockmarket.
</P>
<P>
   One sign of official enthusiasm for REITs in Japan is the
unusual speed with which the required legal and tax arrangements
are being put in place. Sensing, perhaps, the government's resolve
to make the market work, property developers and investors have
announced their own initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Nomura, a securities firm, has teamed up with Mitsui Fudosan, a
big property company, to develop REITs. Mitsubishi Estate, another
big property developer, plans a REIT with Tokio Marine &AMP; Fire and
Dai-Ichi Mutual, two insurers. Sumitomo Life, Mitsubishi Trust and
Mitsui Fudosan, meanwhile, are putting together a property index
that will help the markets new investors to track their
performance.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM -- STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One unanswered question, however, is why Japan needs REITs at
all. Unlike America, all the big property companies are listed on
the stock market. Investors wanting to trade in the property market
can deal in the shares of these companies.
</P>
<P>
   As Etsusuke Masuda of HSBC, a British bank, points out, the
result will be that REITs will compete for investors with existing
property companies, with REITs holding several important
advantages. These will include: exemption from corporate taxes,
provided they pay most of their earnings out in dividends; balance
sheets that do not groan under mountainous debts; and no nagging
fears of hidden losses tucked away in dummy companies.
</P>
<P>
   The existing property companies are the most aggressive
promoters of Japanese REITs, so there will inevitably be some
conflicts of interest. If the property companies transfer some
existing assets into REITs, their own balance sheets are likely to
weaken further. This is because the market will probably demand
that REITs invest only in prime property, at least at first,
leaving the property companies with all the rubbish.
</P>
<P>
   Even if REITs invest only in new property development, they are
likely to attract investors who would otherwise have bought
property-company shares. Either way, REITs will hurt property
companies' share prices, suggesting that the latter have not yet
thought through their enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market, says Masuda, is ahead of them. After a
REIT-inspired rally earlier this year, their share prices have
collapsed again.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is timing. In America, REITS flourished only
after the CMBS market had taken off. Investors first acquired a
taste for low-risk bonds; only then did they start making racier
equity investments in property.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese CMBS market, however, is in its infancy.
Mortgage-backed bond issues require a sophisticated appreciation of
credit risk. Every issue is sliced up into several tranches, with
each one carefully priced according to the likelihood that
investors will get their money back.
</P>
<P>
   But in Japan deadbeat borrowers pay little more interest than
the best credits.
</P>
<P>
   Also lacking is the catalytic role that America's Resolution
Trust Corporation (RTC) played in creating the CMBS market, by
repackaging large volumes of bad loans for sale at market-clearing
prices. Japan's version of the RTC, the Resolution and Collection
Corporation (RCC), has no such plans. It fears a public outcry
should it start selling discounted loans. Most would be bought by
foreigners, who would then seem to benefit at the expense of the
Japanese taxpayer.
</P>
<P>
   More important, discounted sales would require more public money
for the RCC, which Japan's politicians would resist.
</P>
<P>
   Yet without such fire sales, investors may have no confidence
that prices have cleared properly. ING Barings, an investment bank,
guesses that as much as 19-trillion-yen-worth of property is still
hanging over the market _ tied up in bad loans or hidden as
security behind banks bad loans.
</P>
<P>
   Until this hits the market, all the effort that Japan is putting
into developing mortgage-backed securities, REITs and other foreign
exotica, welcome as they are, will seem rather beside the point.

REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS MIGHT HAVE GOT IT RIGHT THIS TIME  
 &HT;    
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
   From The Economist magazine  
 c.2000 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There must be something to this
compassionate-conservatism business. It claims it can help even the
most disadvantaged. And there is evidence to support this.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, one of the stupidest, most self-destructive groups in
America has started to improve its behavior. We refer, of course,
to the Republicans in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The majority party in Congress usually sticks to the same
script. It works itself into a lather, demands vast tax cuts, fails
to agree on its spending proposals in an orderly fashion, and then
stages a big confrontation with the president over the final
make-up of the budget.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, the president wins that battle, largely because the
public does not much care about the tax cut on which Congress has
lavished so much care.
</P>
<P>
   Not this year. For the first time in living memory, the House of
Representatives may pass every one of the 13 bills that make up the
budget before it breaks for a recess at the end of July. The Senate
is only a little behind that cracking pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't ever remember there being this sort of turbocharged
activity in July,'' says Bob Reischauer, a former head of the
Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Republicans dumped all their tax cuts into one
basket _ a proposed income-tax reduction of $792 billion. This
year, they have parcelled out the cuts into bite-sized chunks.
</P>
<P>
   They have passed a bill to end the ``marriage penalty,'' the
extra tax that married couples pay above two people who file their
taxes separately (this would be worth some $290 billion over ten
years); and they propose to scale back the ``death tax'' on
inherited property ($100 billion). Both measures command widespread
support, which makes them harder for the president to veto.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there have been costs. Republicans who came into
office in 1994 as fiscal lions have abandoned their budget
principles and are going out like lambs. Unless there is a
last-minute change, Congress is likely to spend at least 7 percent
more than the limit it had previously promised to stick to.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Moore of the libertarian Cato Institute reckons the
106th Congress (1999-2000) is likely to boost spending in all by 11
percent, making it the most profligate since the 95th (1977-78),
when Jimmy Carter was president.
</P>
<P>
   This splurge has involved ignoring all sorts of self-imposed
restrictions on spending. For example, tax cuts are supposed to be
offset by equal amounts of spending cuts. Congress has ignored that
rule and dipped into the surplus _ which is also formally
forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   Special ``caps'' are supposed to prevent spending above pre-set
limits. These caps have been routinely ignored, were raised in
1997, and are now being ignored again. Obviously, the increase in
tax revenues and the forecast expansion of the budget surplus make
all this possible. But those forecasts assume spending restraint
that Congress is not showing.
</P>
<P>
   There is not even any guarantee that the Republicans will end up
with an amicable settlement with the president this year. Clinton
has promised to veto the Republicans' tax cuts unless Congress
agrees to his version of a bill to improve medical coverage. He has
separately threatened to veto some of the spending proposals
(because they are too small).
</P>
<P>
   Still, compared with the last few years, the Republicans in
Congress have been clever. They have passed tax cuts people have
liked. They are not cutting popular government agencies. They have
their answer ready to the deadly charge of being a ``do-nothing
Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   To politicians in an election year, that is pretty much all that
matters.

LIMITING CAMP DAVID'S DAMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Attention: Commentary editors)
 &HT;    
 From The Economist magazine  
 c.2000 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Locked in a comfortless marriage, Israelis and Palestinians can
manage neither reconciliation nor divorce. The collapse of the
15-day marathon at Camp David showed that even the most zealous
marriage-guidance counselor couldn't do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   If Bill Clinton was not able, in pressure-cooker conditions, to
get Ehud Barak and Yasser Arafat to compromise their positions, it
probably means that those positions, at least in the short term,
are irreconcilable. Yet history dictates that there can be no
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   The reluctant partners have to find some less-than-perfect way
of coexisting on their patch of land. The statement released by the
White House as the summit broke up without agreement Tuesday said
that the two understood ``the importance of avoiding unilateral
actions that prejudge the outcome of negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, both Arafat and Barak are anxious to avoid the
direct, and probably bloody, clash that would follow if the
Palestinians go ahead and declare themselves an independent state
without Israel's agreement, and if Israel in return annexes bits of
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Their good intentions may melt in the heat of the summit's
post-mortems. Arafat, who is returning a hero, having resisted an
equivocal Israeli offer on East Jerusalem, short of the sovereignty
that his people see as their right, can afford to be more generous
in his assessment than Barak, who is returning to a messy domestic
scene, and is therefore blaming Arafat squarely for his obstinacy
in refusing the best offer the Palestinians are likely to get.
</P>
<P>
   Only a little more diplomatically, the Americans are also
blaming Arafat, which confirms Arab suspicions that, despite
Clinton's heroic dedication to deadlock-breaking, America's
pro-Israeli bias lives on.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, there seems little point in continuing the
search for a solution on Jerusalem _ though it is important in the
meantime that Israel does not make a bad situation worse by
unilaterally building more Jewish settlements in the Arab parts of
the city.
</P>
<P>
   So far as one can tell, the two leaders did fairly well on the
other big questions, including the borders of a Palestinian state.
The debate, airing taboo subjects, was useful in itself. But the
domestic vulnerability of both Barak and Arafat led them to insist
that the concessions they have made be kept secret _ which means
that they can now be spun into something rather different.
</P>
<P>
   As the Syrians and Israelis have already discovered, when
nothing is down on paper, it is difficult for new talks to start
from where the old ones broke off.
</P>
<P>
   The aim now has to be damage control. Above all, there must be
interim arrangements to preserve a sense of momentum, and soften
the coming confrontation over statehood. It is not possible to
leave things as they are.
</P>
<P>
   In the belief that it would help Barak to be elected, Arafat
broke an earlier pledge to announce statehood unilaterally. Without
considerable help, he will not be able to break, or modify, his
second pledge to declare it by Sept. 13, the date by which a final
agreement should have been signed.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Palestinian statehood is no big deal. The Israelis now
accept that it would be part of any final agreement. The
Palestinians currently control only about 40 percent of the West
Bank and Gaza, in non-contiguous chunks. Palestinian independence,
say the Palestinians themselves, would, at this stage, be
sovereignty over ``statelets in Israel's belly.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor, for that matter, is Israel's threat to annex further
territory the menace it is made out to be. So long as Barak remains
in charge, he is likely to annex only the Jewish settlements that
he is anyhow determined to keep.
</P>
<P>
   However, if either action is performed in a deliberately
provocative way, the results could be tragic.
</P>
<P>
   People on both sides of the line are in fiery mood, angry both
with each other, and with their own government. Right-wing Israeli
settlers believe Barak to be giving away the store; Palestinians
are sick to their hearts with the unending frustrations of their
trapped existence. Even this week, radical Palestinians have been
demonstrating in Gaza, calling for a resumption of the intifada,
the youthful uprising of the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But, as the Israeli army solemnly warns its government, a new
uprising would not be stone-throwing boys versus Israel's rubber
bullets. The West Bank and Gaza are now rich in weaponry. And if
things get out of hand, the swollen Palestinian police could join
the battle, rather than prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   How to avert this clash? Perhaps by incorporating discussion of
Palestinian statehood in a new set of interim negotiations. Going
back to the interim business is a sad, boring comedown after the
high expectations of a full agreement, but it may now, after the
collapse of the summit, be the most useful approach.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Oslo calendar, Israel still owes the
Palestinians another withdrawal, and should be releasing more
political prisoners. A generous interpretation of both measures
might recapture some of the goodwill that has been forfeited at
Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   And Palestinian statehood, a threat only if Israel perceives it
as such, would not change the reality on the ground, if carried out
on agreed terms. Nor would it make life better for most
Palestinians, let alone bring a permanent settlement closer.
</P>
<P>
   But if it stopped this sad, bad marriage from going up in
flames, that, for the moment, might be blessing enough.

LOOMING DISASTER FOR AMERICA'S MOBILE-PHONE INDUSTRY  
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
   From The Economist magazine  
 c.2000 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   There are lots of reasons to question Deutsche Telekom's
$46.5-billion bid for VoiceStream, ranging from political
objections to its steep valuation of the American firm's customers.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the most serious has hardly been mentioned. Deutsche
Telekom wants VoiceStream in part to win an American license for
the next generation of wireless services, known as 3G, which will
carry broadband data as well as voice.
</P>
<P>
   Those licenses are due to be auctioned this September; the bid
registration deadline is next week. But most of the licenses may be
virtually worthless for some time _ and with them any hope for 3G
spreading through America anywhere near as quickly as it takes hold
in Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   This is a looming disaster for America's mobile-phone industry.
The problem is that it has run out of room to grow: many of the
frequencies most appropriate for new voice and data services are
already being used by anybody from military-communications to
security-alarm firms, a legacy of America's over-generous spectrum
allocation in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The sweetest band of all, that in the 700 megahertz range, where
signals can travel easily through buildings, is occupied by UHF TV
channels that are used by about 100 stations scattered around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) plans to auction off
this band to mobile-phone firms for 3G networks and any other
advanced services that winners may dream up. Among the firms
expected to register next week as bidders are AT&AMP;T, WorldCom, SBC
and VoiceStream, along with such giants from the computer and media
world as Microsoft, AOL-TimeWarner and maybe even Cisco. Total
bidding could reach $50 billion, exceeding even the record $35.5
billion raised by the British government's auction in March.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike previous auctions, the winning bidders will not be
free to roll out services as soon as they can build the networks.
The FCC is selling the spectrum ``encumbered,'' which is to say
already occupied by television stations in most regions.
</P>
<P>
   It will be up to the winning bidders somehow to coax the
stations to give up their valuable frequencies; but most stations
have refused to budge, since this would usually mean going off the
air entirely.
</P>
<P>
   If the stations do not give way, the wireless licenses will, in
effect, be useless. Although the stations are due to give the
spectrum back in 2006, when they switch to digital broadcasting on
different frequencies, they will not have do so if fewer than 85
percent of viewers have switched to digital receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Since it took 22 years for color TV to reach 85 percent of
Americans, and 16 years for video recorders, broadcasters could
squat on this valuable spectrum for a decade or more.
</P>
<P>
   This is a horrifying prospect for America's mobile-phone
operators. After falling far behind Europe and Asia, they have over
the last few years raced back, with a huge investment in digital
networks. The bet is that wireless networks will be the next
Internet; after dominating the technology industry for so long,
American firms are determined not to let it now slip from their
grasp.
</P>
<P>
   But their main obstacle is a chronic shortage of spectrum across
the board, of which the encumbered UHF band is merely the most
immediate example.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with most European countries, America's airwaves are
impossibly cluttered, thanks to its having been an early adopter of
commercial wireless services of all sorts (early radio technology
was far ``leakier'' than today's, and so had to use broader
frequency bands to avoid interfering with other services). Its
local spectrum-allocation policy has also left a crazy patchwork of
available slots in different bands.
</P>
<P>
   Reed Hundt, a former FCC commissioner, estimates that by 2005
the wireless services now in use or planned will require 350-460
megahertz of spectrum, two to three times what is currently
available.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, European countries, which have been stingier over
doling out spectrum, are in better shape. Britain, for instance,
has more than 340 megahertz available, nearly twice the American
figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a crisis that could cost hundreds of billions of
dollars,'' Hundt told a conference on Tuesday. ``I'm calling on
everyone here to wake up to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although this problem will not be fully felt until a new
generation of wireless services beyond those now planned arises, 3G
will be the first big battleground.
</P>
<P>
   Europe and Asia will start deploying 3G networks over the next
two years. As they do so, their American rivals may find they are
unable to budge, blocked from using the licenses that have cost
them so much.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent congressional hearing on the problem, telecom
executives were raising the alarm. ``Selling off such severely
encumbered spectrum makes no sense. It's simply unusable,''
complained Dennis Strigl, chief executive of Verizon Wireless, a
joint venture between Vodafone and Verizon, which was created by a
merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE.
</P>
<P>
   Several potential bidders have asked the FCC to delay the
auctions until a solution to the dilemma is found. Given the
pressure, the FCC may be forced to push the auction back until next
year.
</P>
<P>
   How can a few small TV stations cause such trouble? Blame
Congress. In 1996 it passed a law designed to encourage the
broadcasting industry to move to digital television. In a sweep it
gave each station, in UHF and the other bands, a huge new chunk of
spectrum for digital services; it also allowed them to keep their
old analogue spectrum during the transition from one to the other.
</P>
<P>
   This was controversial for a number of reasons. First, it gave
away spectrum that could have been worth billions of dollars had it
been auctioned. Worse, it gave it to broadcasters, not the most
innovative of firms.
</P>
<P>
   And by not making them give back their old frequencies for a
decade or more, it locked up even more valuable spectrum for the
most pedestrian of uses, analogue TV broadcasting to a small and
shrinking market: viewers who still use basic aerials.
</P>
<P>
   If the UHF-broadcast market is as poor as that, why are the
stations so reluctant to give it up? Because the act of sending out
a television signal _ even if not a single person is receiving it _
brings with it a golden reward: a free channel on the local cable
network, thanks to the FCC's ``must carry'' provisions that ensure
that cable viewers can see all local stations.
</P>
<P>
   The moment a broadcaster stops transmitting a signal, it loses
its cable channel. And, since more than 65 percent of Americans now
get their television on cable, that means losing most viewers too.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcasters claim that they too are in a bind. Although the
same law requires them to start broadcasting a digital signal, a
bungled standard-setting process for receivers means that nobody is
watching. There are almost no digital TV receivers in America
today, and if the standards mess continues there will not be any
for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC has sweetened the pot by offering ``must carry'' rights
on digital cable systems for digital broadcasters, but these
represent a small fraction of cable subscribers today. Even if it
were to extend that to analogue cable, too, this would still
exclude the nearly 100 million Americans who do not subscribe to
cable.
</P>
<P>
   In similar situations in the past, the FCC has marched in and
seized spectrum, moving its occupants to other frequencies with
minimal compensation. But those tended to be niche industrial
users, such as microwave transmitters.
</P>
<P>
   Television, on the other hand, is America's passion and is not
so easily pushed around. No wonder Congress voted to spare couch
potatoes any interruption of their favourite soaps, rather than
bring in unknown new services from what was, in 1996, a relatively
sleepy wireless industry.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is discovering the price of that decision. If the
spectrum-auction winners have to pay the TV stations to leave early
(or to switch channels with stations in other bands that are
willing to sell their space), the cost could exceed even that of
the auctions themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The broadcasters can hold the wireless industry to ransom,''
warns one telecom executive.
</P>
<P>
   Congress could change the law, of course, but that would mean
defeating the broadcasting lobby, which would be neither easy nor
quick.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the controversy will hold up 3G telephony for years,
which will carry its own costs, both in the services available to
consumers and in the clout of America's high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   European technology firms are used to envying their American
rivals, even to paying over the odds for them. But as the
mobile-phone gap widens, those days may be numbered.

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Hippy dreams have a habit of ending _ particularly
when they clash with the money-making instincts of the music
industry.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the suits seemed to win another battle against peace,
love and happiness, when they were awarded a court injunction
effectively closing down Napster, a company whose software allows
its commune of users to trade songs for free.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, most of the signs are that free music may
win, man.
</P>
<P>
   Napster's software allows users to exchange songs directly,
matching them up by maintaining a central who's-got-which-song
database. This directory has been closed. But only for the time
being.
</P>
<P>
   An appeal is planned by Napster's legal team (which is headed by
the lawyer who led the antitrust team against Microsoft). And other
communal software devices will prove much harder targets to
vanquish through the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Song-trading software programs such as Gnutella have no central
bits vulnerable to legal attack. Instead, users find songs by
linking one to the other, forming a sort of network akin to the
Internet itself.
</P>
<P>
   The Recording Industry Association of America has only itself to
blame. Music lovers wanting to collect songs on their computers _
hardly an unreasonable request _ have little choice but to do so
with Napster and its like.
</P>
<P>
   True, the industry's own Secure Digital Music Initiative is
creeping along, but it is about two years too late.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the very notion of secure music may be an illusion: a
song needs to be decrypted to be played, at which point it can be
digitized and traded. Already the betting is that the RIAA and
Napster will strike a deal, averting an expensive court case. More
generally some sort of compromise about online music is likely.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, this week author Stephen King released to the Web
the first chapter of his latest serialized horror story. Users can
download it for free, but are then supposed to send $1 per chapter.
So far most have. Though such a trust-based system will not work
for all artists, it might work with some.
</P>
<P>
   Another pointer is the fact that the music industry has cried
wolf before; the first time the enemy was cassette tapes, which
also seemed to portend the end of copyright.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, tapes did little damage: most fans were willing to
pay for the real thing, to get the colorful insert and other
accompanying miscellany.
</P>
<P>
   Studies show that, if the music labels can put their songs
online in a format that is more organized and more appealing than
their illegal competitors can, fans would be willing to pay
something for that privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Internet music, like rock and roll, is here to stay.
Hey, hey. &QL;

DANFORTH REPORT SHOULD QUELL DAVIDIAN CONSPIRACY CAMPAIGN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bad news for the Mount Carmel conspiracy nuts: David Koresh set
the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us already knew that, of course, but special counsel
John Danforth made it official when he issued his preliminary
report in the latest investigation of the federal government's
handling of that Branch Davidian business back in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, a former U.S. senator from Missouri and an Episcopal
priest, is renowned in and out of government for his competence and
integrity. If Danforth says that Koresh was responsible for the
fire that consumed him and 80 or so members of his cult, we can
stop arguing about it _ Koresh was responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth's own assessment of the conclusions produced by his
investigation told us everything that we needed to know. Danforth
is most assuredly not a man who is prone to overstatement, and yet
he couldn't have been more emphatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give you these conclusions with 100 percent certainty,'' he
said as he released the preliminary report at a news conference
last week.
</P>
<P>
   He urged reporters and the public to read his preface to the
report to confirm how strongly he felt about the findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This interim report summarizes the exhaustive efforts
undertaken to date to investigate every lead and to test every
theory,'' Danforth wrote. ``There is no doubt in my mind about the
conclusions of this report.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said that the investigation not only proved that the
Davidians started the fire that destroyed their compound on April
19, 1993, but also refuted allegations that federal agents shot at
the Davidians that day and that military forces were used
illegally.
</P>
<P>
   It bears repeating: Danforth is not inclined to overstatement.
Now here's some more of his preface:
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, what is remarkable is the overwhelming evidence
exonerating the government from the charges made against it, and
the lack of any real evidence to support the charges of bad acts.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said that the lack of evidence implicating the
government in wrongdoing was ``particularly remarkable in light of
the widespread and persistent public belief that the government
engaged in bad acts at Waco.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth referred to a 1999 Time magazine poll saying that 61
percent of those surveyed believed that federal agents started the
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Amazing, isn't it? If the poll was accurate, we must conclude
that six out of every 10 Americans suspected the government of the
greatest democracy on earth of incinerating a building full of men,
women and children.
</P>
<P>
   It's especially amazing when you consider that it isn't true.
</P>
<P>
   How could so many people come to believe such a horrifying lie _
such a preposterous piece of fiction?
</P>
<P>
   Start with reckless, irresponsible members of Congress who must
have known the truth but decided that undermining the nation's
respect for law and order was a fair tradeoff for a chance to
pummel President Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno. For
Clinton/Reno haters, it was far more rewarding to blame the
government for the lethal debacle near Waco, Texas, than to concede
that it was perpetrated by a murdering, child-molesting
megalomaniac known as David Koresh.
</P>
<P>
   With some of America's most powerful lawmakers leading the
charge, it became politically and socially acceptable for seemingly
legitimate television and radio talk-show hosts to jump on the
misinformation bandwagon right along with the countless goofballs
who spend their days wondering when government agents will start
kicking down doors and methodically replacing America's hard-won
liberty with some mysterious tyranny known as the New World Order.
</P>
<P>
   And the mainstream media is not without blame. Maybe some
newspaper or TV news outlet made a serious effort to set the record
straight, but if so, it slipped by me. For the most part, the media
chose to fuel the conspiracy theories by treating unfounded
allegations against the government as if they might have some basis
in fact.
</P>
<P>
   So. Thank you, John Danforth. The truth was long overdue.

ABBOTT LABS RESTRUCTURES MANAGEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by clients of The New York Times News Service) (Eds: Stock

<P>
   Abbott Laboratories (ABT:NYSE) said Friday that its president
and chief operating officer plans to step down in August, paving
the way for a new management structure at the maker of health care
products.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Parkinson, 49, will serve as an adviser until his
retirement in January, after almost 25 years at the Abbott Park,
Ill.-based company.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the position of president and chief operating officer
will be replaced by a team of three, with each person responsible
for one of three areas: pharmaceuticals, medical products and the
company's Ross Products division, which focuses on nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Leiden, 44, will take charge of the pharmaceutical
division and maintain his responsibilities as chief scientific
officer. Richard Gonzalez, 46, will take charge of the medical
products division. Joy Amundson, already a senior vice president at
Ross Products, will take responsibility of that division. All three
will report to Miles White, chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new leadership model is part of a long-term strategic
plan to provide strong scientific focus across our businesses,''
said White in a statement. ``It provides better alignment both
strategically and scientifically for our core pharmaceutical
businesses and at the same time provides focused leadership for our
medical products businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Abbott closed Thursday trading at 40, up 1/8. There
was no action in premarket trading, according to Island ECN.

ALL MY .EXES LIVE IN TEXAS, I THINK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: A recent article made reference to dumping
files with either a .Vbs or .Js extension and also files with .Exe,
.Com and .Bat extensions. I have been unable to find any extensions
on my e-mail files.
</P>
<P>
   _ No Dots
</P>
<P>
   DEAR NO: Microsoft dumbed down Windows when they introduced 95
to keep it from scaring people, and that included hiding certain
extensions.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the goofy legacy of DOS is that file types are
identified by extensions rather than internal coding. For example,
when you click on an .Exe, Windows knows it should run it.
</P>
<P>
   That column warned about opening e-mail attachments with the
extensions you mentioned, since they are potential virus carriers.
Those extensions are among the hidden ones.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing I do every time I install Windows _ aside from

   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I moved my pixel setting to the ``most''
position and blanked out my screen. A friend got my display working
again, but everything is grainy and my daughter's games cannot be
played because the computer is only working with 16 colors. I'm
sorry I was toying with my computer, and I will never do it again.
</P>
<P>
   _ Learned My Lesson
</P>
<P>
   DEAR LESSON: Nonsense. Goobering up your computer is the only
way to learn about it. You now have the wonderful opportunity to
teach yourself all about video cards, monitors and software
drivers, you lucky guy.
</P>
<P>
   You attempted to make your system do more than it could and it
freaked. Go into Safe Mode to patch things up. Just hit F8 when you
see the ``Starting Windows'' message.
</P>
<P>
   Delete the video card and monitor from the Device Manager (Look
in System in the Control Panel), and hope that Windows recognizes
your specific hardware when you reboot. If it doesn't, you get
stuck with generic drivers that will limit you to 16 colors in a
640-by-480 display.
</P>
<P>
   Latch onto the specific drivers for your hardware at the
manufacturer's Web site, and follow the instructions that should
come with them. Then maybe your daughter will speak to you again.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I take exception with one piece of advice you
gave recently when you suggested using a program to block the ads
on Web pages. How can sites operate without income? Is there a
program to remove the ads from the newspaper page that your column
is on?
</P>
<P>
   _ Morally Outraged
</P>
<P>
   DEAR OUT: I guess it shouldn't have been a surprise to find all
those banner ads _ including one for a cheesy matchmaking service _
cluttering up your own Web site, which appears to be a
conglomeration of half-baked commentaries by semi-literate
``writers'' striving desperately to feel their own importance.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. I think that's good. The Internet is the
last frontier of independent commentary, a democracy where even a
loon is entitled to 15 minutes on the soapbox.
</P>
<P>
   But now I'm confused. I quote from your own article:
``Sponsorships ... can influence the information you read, hear or
see. Therefore, much of the news you're presented (with) should be
greeted with a measure of skepticism.''
</P>
<P>
   Couldn't have said it better myself.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and please patronize our fine advertisers.

KATHIE LEE GIFFORD FADES OUT _ QUIETLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was, of course, doomed from the start. Short of announcing
that she would divorce Frank, collaborate with Eminem, or get an
on-air sex change, there was simply no chance that Kathie Lee
Gifford's last day on the job Friday was going to live up to the
media hype of the past week _ let alone 15 years filled with the
sort of fierce adoration and unbridled loathing reserved for
controversial politicians and talk-show hosts.
</P>
<P>
   So like most highly anticipated events, Kathie Lee's final hour
co-hosting ``Live with Regis and Kathie Lee'' was strangely
anti-climactic. There were no poignant outpourings of affection, no
sly glimmers of relief, and precious little of that famous
chemistry. There wasn't, in fact, an unguarded moment. Ironically,
our (anti) hero's final hour was characterized by a marked absence
of spunk and spontaneity _ the very qualities that made her a
household name.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we scrolled back through the archives, fondly
chronicling the hairdos, the repartee, the amusing animal segments.
Famous friends (Rosie, Letterman, Howie Mandel, Susan Lucci) sent
videotaped farewells. Illustrious colleagues appeared in person,
most notably Disney chief (and Kathie Lee's boss) Michael Eisner,
to present her with a ``Mouscar'' award and a plea for one more
farewell week. Protracted departures, he sensitively pointed out,
get great ratings. Cody and Cassidy padded dutifully onstage to
deliver a gift basket of cookbooks and foodstuffs in the hope that
mom ``could learn to make cereal.'' Even Kathie Lee didn't look
amused, and who can blame her. The future is now.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, we were left with a handful of archetypal images. A
final dusting off of Regis's suit jacket (Sweet Kathie Lee). A
sassy red dress with a plunging neckline (Saucy Kathie Lee). A
written proclamation from Rudy Guiliani encapsulating her career,
prompting Kathie Lee to inquire if every scandal was included
(Teflon Kathie Lee).
</P>
<P>
   In between flashbacks and tributes she swallowed hard and
blinked back tears. Not that revisiting her quips through the years
about Regis's hemorrhoids wasn't entirely appropriate. But more
important, it relieved her of the impossible task of saying
good-bye. In the end, Kathie Lee folded her winning hand in the
noble _ but oh so disappointing _ pursuit of keeping it together.
</P>
<P>
   Champagne and cake were wheeled out. The kids made a beeline for
the dessert table. ``Good-bye, sweetie,'' said Regis. ``I love
you,'' said Kathie Lee. Then, in a last gesture she'll probably
regret for the rest of her life, Kathie Lee unfolded her napkin and
threw it over her face.
</P>
<P>
   It is, finally, a wrap.

 ART ADVISORY: With two photos, of Aphrodite Tsairis (NNS1) and Suse
Lowenstein (NNS2)
 By BOB BRAUN  
 c.2000 Newhouse News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two Libyans are on trial here for mass murder.
</P>
<P>
   But to many of the families of the 270 men, women and children
killed in the terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988,
considerably more is at stake than the fate of two Libyans.
</P>
<P>
   Especially for the relatives of 189 dead Americans -- the
largest number of American civilians ever killed in a terrorist
attack.
</P>
<P>
   To them, the ability of the American government to protect its
citizens from terrorist attack is still an issue. So is its
willingness to care more about justice than about the politics of
oil.
</P>
<P>
   So is the meaning of justice. Or vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   And how to go on living without irreplaceable children or
parents or husbands or wives or sisters or brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what justice is anymore,'' says Gerry Buser of
Glen Rock, N.J., here for the trial, which adjourned Thursday for a
three-week break. ``I don't know whether I'll find it here. But I
came to see whether I could look them in the eye. And I could.''
</P>
<P>
   Buser, 73, here with her daughter Eileen and granddaughter Kate,
lost her husband, a son, a daughter and an unborn grandchild when a
semtex bomb, placed inside a cassette tape player and wrapped in a
blue baby jumper, tore through the fuselage of a Boeing 747 at 7:02
p.m., Wednesday, Dec. 21, 1988, some 31,000 feet over the small
Scottish town of Lockerbie.
</P>
<P>
   All 259 passengers and crew members were killed. On the ground,
11 residents of a housing project in Lockerbie were vaporized when
the jumbo jet's engines crashed into four homes, creating an
inferno of burning aviation fuel that still haunts the memories of
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all grown up now, but my children still fear the sound
of the wind,'' says Donald Bogie of Lockerbie. ``It was the wind
that carried the flames through the town.''
</P>
<P>
   Debris from the disintegrating plane was strewn over 850 square
miles. Local residents still fear they may yet find grisly
reminders of the tragedy. The bodies of 17 victims were never
found.
</P>
<P>
   For 12 years, a criminal trial is what many of the victims'
families wanted -- a way to obtain justice, to fix blame, to learn
what has been heretofore hidden in the secret files of American and
Scottish investigators.
</P>
<P>
   A trial, yes, but, to some, not this trial. Not here in an
abandoned NATO air force base. Not here among a mixed collection of
empty and expensively refurbished buildings adjacent to a Dutch
military museum surrounded by hulks of decommissioned airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's designed to ensure few people here will even know it's
going on,'' says Susan Cohen of Cape May, N.J. She and her husband,
Daniel, have been its most ardent critics. They lost their only
child, a daughter, Theo, 20, one of 35 Syracuse University students
returning from a semester in London.
</P>
<P>
   The average age of the victims was 27. The youngest was 2
months.
</P>
<P>
   The trial takes place in a courtroom separated from spectators
by a wall of bulletproof and soundproof glass, a courtroom
populated by men and women who wear wigs, presided over by judges
in white robes emblazoned with red crosses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep thinking of `Alice in Wonderland,''' says Helen Tobin
of Hempstead, N.Y. She lost her son, Mark, 21, a Fordham student.
</P>
<P>
   This is a Scottish trial, conducted under Scottish law by
Scottish judges and, by quirk of international treaty, sited in
what is considered Scottish soil guarded by Scottish cops bearing
semi-automatic rifles and patrolled by two Scottish bomb-sniffing
dogs.
</P>
<P>
   That's the result of a compromise. The accused, Abdelbasset Ali
Mohmed al-Megrahi, 48, and Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah, 44, were
indicted by U.S. and British justice officials on Nov. 14, 1991,
but Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi refused to turn them over. After
seven years of U.N. sanctions and secret diplomacy, the U.S. and
British governments acceded to Gadhafi's demand that the two be
tried in a neutral country.
</P>
<P>
   That, to some Americans, was a betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a deal, because our government wanted the problem to go
away,'' says Susan Cohen. ``Business interests were more
important.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is no death penalty under Scottish law. One Texas
woman, Libby Purtell -- who lost a son, a daughter-in-law and a
grandchild -- sighs, ``In Texas, we would know what to do with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of its location and strict Scottish court rules against
media coverage, the trial of a terrorist attack even more lethal to
Americans than Oklahoma City has received little attention. If you
want to see it, you must come here. Family members -- and only
family members -- can view it on downlink sites, but only in
Washington, New York, London and Dumfries, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Still, to other family members, it was the best anyone could
expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The alternative was never having a trial,'' says Aphrodite
Tsairis of Franklin Lakes, N.J. She views the Camp Zeist
proceedings as a triumph of years of lobbying and pressure and
pleading.
</P>
<P>
   ``The train is on the track now, and it has a life of its own,''
says Tsairis, whose daughter, Alexia, 20, was killed in the
bombing. ``Finally, I can breathe a sigh of relief. We no longer
need to push.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial is often puzzling to the Americans, most of whom fly
here courtesy of the U.S. Justice Department's Office of Victims of
Crime. They get airfare and a week in a nearby hotel. They must pay
for meals, and they are expensive, so some have dinners of snacks
in the bar because the nearest town is a mile walk.
</P>
<P>
   It's puzzling because the lawyers do not offer statements
explaining evidence, either at the opening or in mid-trial. They
don't ``connect up'' as American lawyers do, so viewers have some
sense of narrative. And Scottish law requires corroboration of
every fact put into evidence.
</P>
<P>
   But gradually a picture has emerged that fits the prosecution's
case: A suitcase bearing the bomb -- in a cassette player
grotesquely called a ``Bombeat'' -- somehow got on an Air Malta
plane to Frankfurt, then was transferred to a Pan Am feeder flight
to London, then, although unaccompanied by a passenger, loaded into
the cargo hold of Pan Am 103 to New York.
</P>
<P>
   A cassette player that, prosecutors say, detonated in the skies
above Lockerbie on the longest night of the year, four days before
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   There are no lawyerly histrionics. The decorum of a Scottish
court won't permit it. But there has been drama. Lockerbie
residents describing the inferno, the debris, the bodies. The
reading of victims' names. A Swiss engineer who sold bomb timers to
Libyans. A Malta shopkeeper identifying Megrahi as the man who
bought the baby jumper. A travel agent describing Fhimah, an
employee of Libyan Arab Airlines, as a man with unfettered access
to luggage-bearing conveyor belts -- and luggage tags -- at Malta's
Luqa Airport.
</P>
<P>
   There's been anger, too. After former Pan Am security officials
from Frankfurt spoke of international alerts about terrorism --
warnings passengers never saw -- Helen Englehardt Hawkins of
Brooklyn, widowed by the bomb, denounced them as ``Eichmanns -- all
of them -- and they should be tried.''
</P>
<P>
   How is the trial going? ``Fine,'' says Colin Boyd, Scotland's
Lord Advocate, Scotland's Attorney General. He often visits
American relatives attending the trial. ``Hard to say,'' says Jack
Davidson, one of the Scottish defense lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   That's all they'll say, because Scottish lawyers can go to jail
for commenting on a case. So can journalists who write about them.
</P>
<P>
   The constraints on the two sides make it difficult to judge just
how solid the prosecution's case is -- or how confident the
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Much will depend on a witness scheduled to testify after the
trial's summer break ends Aug. 22. His name is Abdul Majid Giaka, a
Libyan defector -- with Megrahi, a member of the secret police --
now in an American witness protection program. He has been
identified as an eyewitness with personal knowledge of Fhimah and
Megrahi's connection to the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   If Giaka says what he is expected to say and withstands
cross-examination, the defendants might be convicted. If not, the
judges -- sitting instead of a jury, another compromise -- may
acquit.
</P>
<P>
   Or, in another peculiarity of Scottish law, the judges could
issue a verdict of ``not proven.'' It has the same effect as an
acquittal -- the accused go free and cannot be retried -- but is
not a statement of innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be like the crash all over again,'' says Helen Tobin.
``I don't know how I could survive it.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Many -- perhaps most -- Americans attending the trial believe
Fhimah and Megrahi are guilty. ``I can't look at the defendants,''
says New Hampshire physician Lestra Benello, whose son Julian, 25,
a Cambridge student, was killed in the bombing. ``I can't look into
the eyes of evil.''
</P>
<P>
   They don't buy defense contentions, outlined in a so-called
``special plea'' filed with the court, that the bombing was carried
out by the Syrian-backed Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine -- General Command (PFLP-GC). Defense attorneys already
have established Mohammed Abu Talb, a member of the group now in
prison in Sweden, was in Malta in December 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Because they are convinced of the Libyans' guilt, many relatives
may see a not guilty or not proven verdict as the last -- perhaps
most unbearable -- betrayal in a long series that began when the
United States failed to react immediately and forcefully to the
bombing, failed to act against Gadhafi and other Libyan officials
when the indictments were issued, and failed to insist on having
the trial in the United States or the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``If politics is about taking lives,'' asks Dan Tobin, 30,
Mark's brother, ``why isn't it our turn? We have such a feeling of
impotence.''
</P>
<P>
   A few relatives believe the Libyans may not be responsible. One
is Marina Larracoechea of New York. Her sister, Maria, was a flight
attendant on Pan Am 103. The American government, she says, knew
Pan Am 103 would be blown out of the sky but did nothing -- our way
of compensating Iran for the accidental shooting down of an Iranian
airline by the U.S.S. Vincennes four months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister, all those people, were sacrificed,'' she says,
adding she believes the highest government officials in the United
States, the United Kingdom and Germany -- not two Libyans -- should
be in the dock.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the trial itself -- barely noticed in world media
-- is less important to relatives than the ways they have come to
terms with their own losses. And that has everything to do with
Lockerbie and its residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't forgotten us,'' says Buser who, like many
relatives attending the trial, took a side trip to the Scottish
town. ``They show us a respect we haven't received from our own
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockerbie residents often greet American relatives at Dryfesdale
Cemetery, the site of a granite tablet bearing all the victims'
names. Christy Hunter, 22, says he comes there often. He was 10 in
1988 and recalls being led through the streets of town while
burning debris swirled about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans want to know details,'' he says. ``I tell them.''
</P>
<P>
   It is there, in Lockerbie, not 400 miles away in the
Netherlands, where many Americans have come to find peace during
the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may sound strange, but if it had to happen, I'm glad it
happened here,'' says Suse Lowenstein of Montauk, N.Y. Her son,
Alexander, 21, was on Pan Am 103. ``I find so much peace here.''
</P>
<P>
   She is resting on the grass, her back against a stone wall. A
few yards away is the cairn she built years ago on the spot where
Alexander hit the earth with so much impact his body left an
indentation.
</P>
<P>
   At least once a year, she comes to repair the cairn. Cows that
graze nearby rub their backs against it and loosen the stones. She
has put sand from Montauk inside it. A name tag Alexander wore when
he parked cars for a summer job. On this trip, she has brought a
colorful snail shell from home to hide within the hard whinstone
once quarried here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cry here, but I also laugh a lot. I have no more bitterness.
No more hate,'' says Lowenstein, who often comes in the spring to
help local farmers deliver new lambs.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is important, she says, but to be here, close to where
Alexander died, is more so.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   ``For Alexander, I have tried to live a much richer life,'' says
Lowenstein, a sculptress whose statues can be found in a number of
corporate offices.
</P>
<P>
   One of her works, a tribute to Alexander, hangs at Dryfesdale.
She places a rose on the plaque depicting a dolphin frolicking
among the waves.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a surfer and loved the sea. And he was so playful.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of her work since 1988 has dealt with the tragedy. On her
lawn in Montauk is ``Dark Elegy,'' a collection of 50 life-size
statues of Pan Am relatives -- all women -- who posed for her,
depicted as they remembered themselves at the moment they heard of
Lockberie, frozen in horror and agony.
</P>
<P>
   The women posed nude -- ``We all were stripped naked emotionally
by what happened'' -- and inside each statue are hidden mementos of
the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Only one woman is depicted twice: Lowenstein herself. One statue
shows her on her knees, her head buried in her hands. Facing it is
another, head up, hands outstretched to the woman overwhelmed by
grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's me, too. Telling myself I must live.''
</P>

 Republicans Striving for Kinder, Gentler Convention

 By BILL WALSH  
 c.2000 Newhouse News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Andrew Card was at the Republican National Convention in Houston
the night in 1992 when sharp-tongued conservative commentator Pat
Buchanan took the podium and warned that a ``religious war ... a
cultural war'' was being fought over the soul of America.
</P>
<P>
   The speech was a hit inside the convention hall, but Card feared
that it left viewers at home feeling uneasy, maybe even a bit
scared, about the Republican Party's message, as well as its
messengers.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years -- and two Democratic administrations -- later, Card
is the chief planner for the 2000 Republican convention, which
starts Monday in Philadelphia, and the message he hopes to project
this time is quite different.
</P>
<P>
   If everything goes according to Card's carefully scripted plan,
which is by no means a certainty with street protests expected and
roiling discontent inside the GOP over abortion, viewers will be
left feeling warm, fuzzy and, above all, welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``This convention is more about the word `together' than it is
about `divide,''' Card said in an interview. ``Just as Gov. Bush
has done, we're reaching out beyond those who call themselves
Republicans. This convention is about a new kind of Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   In order to entice independents and moderate Democrats into the
fold, planners hope to portray a Republican Party that people may
not recognize. The most visible sign of change will be at the
podium, which will feature a steady stream of African-American and
Hispanic speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent slots will be filled by longtime GOP stars like former
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell and Bush's
foreign policy adviser Condoleeza Rice. The minority roster also
features a Hispanic securities broker from Los Angeles who will
talk about economic opportunity and an African-American literacy
expert.
</P>
<P>
   Bush himself is expected in his acceptance speech Thursday to
acknowledge that his party has been less than a friendly haven for
minorities in the recent past. He has hit on the theme several
times while campaigning before African-American audiences and it
has been well-received.
</P>
<P>
   Just as convention planners are trying to change the face of the
party, so too are they sending notice that they care about more
than traditional Republican issues like tax cuts and a strong
national defense. In fact, those who tune in to the first day of
the convention may wonder whether a renegade Democrat has somehow
gotten hold of the schedule of events. That day will be dedicated
entirely to education and health care, the meat and potatoes of
Democratic politics for a generation.
</P>
<P>
   As the convention progresses, more traditional GOP themes will
take center stage. Days two and three of the convention will focus
on economic prosperity, national defense and tax relief, issues
that have always been near and dear to the hearts of Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the GOP convention is designed to be the
anti-convention, or at least appear that way on television.
Planners have scrapped the typical castle-turret design for the
speakers' platform and have replaced it with what will look to
viewers like a theater stage, which will morph daily into a
colorful backdrop designed to illustrate that day's chosen theme.
On day one, when speakers talk about education, they will stand in
front of a faux-classroom outfitted with desks, a blackboard and
students.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the speakers' lineup will feature ``everyday people''
rather than party poobahs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going after day-to-day people who have a story to
tell,'' said Pat Brister, the Louisiana delegation chair who is
also in charge of making sure everyone makes their on-stage cues.
</P>
<P>
   Those stories will be of the up-by-the-bootstraps variety
underscoring, in a subtle and non-threatening way, the Republicans'
message of self-reliance. Among the speakers will be a breast
cancer survivor, a blind mountain climber and a Chinese emigre who
came to the United States knowing no English and rose to become
head of the Peace Corps.
</P>
<P>
   Even the convention's theme -- ``Renewing America's Purpose.
Together'' -- is designed to sound more like a friendly invitation
than a rousing call to action.
</P>
<P>
   In still other ways, the tone of the proceedings is designed to
be reassuring and pleasant. Planners have axed from the program the
night usually dedicated to attacking the opposition. In
Philadelphia, sneering, sarcastic attacks on Democrats will be
frowned on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a totally positive, totally unifying
atmosphere,'' Brister said.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   The GOP will have less control over events outside the
convention hall. Across the street from the First Union Center, the
sports arena that will house the Republican gathering, protesters
are expected to do everything they can to get the attention of the
15,000 credentialed media representatives covering the convention.
Some of the protesters who carried the word of anti-globalization
to Seattle last year to disrupt the World Trade Organization
meeting are expected to show up in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a group working on behalf of death row inmate Mumia
Abu-Jamal is expected to be out in force to protest what they say
is a frame-up for the killing of a white Philadelphia police
officer in 1981. The protest will no doubt be fueled by a recent
suspect's beating at the hands of city police, which was caught on
videotape and broadcast worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Another wild card for convention planners is Sen. John McCain,
the upstart Arizona Republican who was Bush's closest rival for the
nomination. Although McCain has endorsed Bush, convention planners
are concerned that his speech on Tuesday could trigger a
spontaneous rally on the floor and draw attention away from the
presumptive nominee. Partly to address that fear, McCain has been
instructed to talk about national security rather his signature
issue, campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their best efforts to diffuse potential disputes in
advance of the convention, Republican leaders may have an internal
squabble on their hands. A group called the Republican Pro-Choice
Coalition says it will try to convince the party to drop the strict
pro-life plank from the platform.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Cullman, one of the coalition's leaders, said no
demonstrations are planned, but the group does intend to try to get
the microphone on the convention floor, a feat that will take the
support of at least six state delegations. She said she has been
frustrated up until now by what she sees as the GOP's intransigence
on this issue above all others.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been more civility toward us than in the past, but
when people are nice to you and say to you that you won't get your
way, you have to do what you have to do,'' Cullman said.
</P>
<P>
   One group that the GOP may not have to worry about,
surprisingly, is the conservative wing of the party whose
Buchanan-like stridency in the past has made reaching out to a
broader segment of supporters difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Schlafly of the conservative Eagle Forum, who rather
enjoyed Buchanan's controversial speech in 1992, proclaimed herself
in a recent interview to be satisfied with the format and content
of this year's convention.
</P>
<P>
   She said she hoped that planners allowed delegates to roam the
aisles and hold up signs, unlike at the 1996 convention in San
Diego. As for the direction of the party and the message convention
planners are trying to send in Philadelphia, Schlafly said she had
no concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, there is nothing to demonstrate about,'' she
said.

WITH BUSH'S BACKING, N.H. WINS FIRST ROUND TO STAY NO. 1 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July   30)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA -- Forces of the victor and the vanquished from
last winter's New Hampshire Republican primary joined hands Friday
to repel the initial attempt to dislodge the Granite State from its
pole position.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire's primary primacy survived opening challenges to
its strategic location at the front of the primary schedule in a
meeting of the Convention Rules Committee. ``My guess is that it
will remain the status quo,'' said GOP national committeeman Tom
Rath, a Concord lawyer and veteran of repeated skirmishes over New
Hampshire's way-out-of-proportion influence on the nominating
processes of both major parties.
</P>
<P>
   What was known as ``the Delaware plan'' was beaten back by
delegates from the larger states, with the active encouragement of
Rath and New Hampshire GOP chairman Steve Duprey. But there
remained a chance that over the weekend, states that want to re-jig
the schedule might succeed in winning enough votes to force a floor
fight at Monday's opening afternoon session. ``We live to fight
another day,'' said Rath at midday Friday, ``But until we have that
vote, I'm not relieved.''
</P>
<P>
   Another approach, under the label of ``flexibility,'' would give
the GOP National Committee the right to modify the primary schedule
in terms of what former GOP national chairman Haley Barbour of
Mississippi called ``time and sequence.'' Barbour said that when it
comes to scheduling presidential primaries, ``any solution has to
be bipartisan,'' because state Republican parties could not afford
to pay for primary elections in states where Democrats control the
legislature.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment, said Rath, New Hampshire remains No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need a change -- but I don't know what,'' said a
Massachusetts delegate on the Rules Committee, Mrs. Madeleine
Gelsinon of Sudbury. An elected member of the Massachusetts GOP
State Committee, she became a convention delegate by virtue of
aligning with the insurgent candidacy of Sen. John McCain, who
gobbled up Bush in the Bay State after winning New Hampshire by 20
points.
</P>
<P>
   There was a joint front Friday with the McCain elements joining
the Bush campaign in rebuffing attempts to re-jig the primary
system to diminish New Hampshire's pivotal role. Gelsinon said the
McCain chain of command passed word to her that ``they want to keep
it status quo,'' with New Hampshire remaining the primary with
primacy.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates backing alternatives such as the Delaware plan _ and
others intended to seduce the support of big states that vote after
New Hampshire, but find their influence dwarfed by the tiny Granite
State's _ faced off in a meeting room several miles from the
convention hall itself.
</P>
<P>
   Gelsinon, fitness director at the Norumbega Point retirement
community in Weston and mother of three married to an oral surgeon,
is attending her third convention. She is a pro-life Republican
whose father was a White House correspondent for a Roman Catholic
news service, a one-time Pat Buchanan supporter who broke with him
over trade, and now a McCainiac for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   She'd responded to a letter from McCain asking her to be a
delegate, and she made it when the Bush forces got swamped in the
Northeast, Bush losing every New England state but Maine. Those
results seem reflected in the delegate seating arrangements inside
the First Union Center. New Hampshire is way off in the back, and
Vermont has an obstructed view, as remote as the District of
Columbia's, reflecting the lack of juice of the District, whose
Republicans have nary a prayer of delivering the capital's vote to
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting her adopted New England perspective, Gelsinon, who
grew up in Washington, said ``New Hampshire definitely has got to
be Number One'' when primary season rolls around. Without New
Hampshire's open access to dark horse candidacies, its ease of
travel and receptivity to early and energetic candidacies, there
would have been no upstart victories like those of Reagan in '80,
George Bush Sr. in '88, Buchanan in '96 and McCain this year.
</P>
<P>
   She backed Buchanan and McCain, and recognizes the threat to
insurgent candidacies that can reconstitute a topheavy or sclerotic
party leadership if New Hampshire's role is subsumed into a
different primary scheduling scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Morton Blackwell, a Virginia delegate, appeared hopping mad when
he emerged from a morning rules panel session to tell reporters
that the current system discriminates against bigger, more
important states. ``It's rotten for our party, and rotten for our
country.''
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire is a humbler of frontrunners; the list of big
losers includes Reagan in '76 (barely beaten back by a weakened
President Ford); Bush Sr. in '80, defeated by ``I'm paying for this
microphone ...'' Ronald Reagan; Bob Dole in '88 (loser to Bush Sr.)
and Bush Sr. as president in '92, when Buchanan got a scary 37
percent to reveal Bush's weakeness there).
</P>
<P>
   But the Bush campaign, and the McCain camp which controls five
of six New England delegations, agreed it would be unwise to try to
dump New Hampshire now.

HOME VIDEO: IT'S A SEQUEL? OK, I'LL TAKE IT 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   These days, home video is especially keen on its own progeny:
those feature-length films, animated and live action, that go
straight to cassette and disc without playing in theaters. Not that
there has been too much of a critical sea change. Direct-to-video
movies still couldn't be any good, or so goes the view even of most
video dealers, who regard a movie's record on the big screen as
vital to its appeal at home.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, huge amounts of money have broadened the outlook.
Big direct-to-video movies like ``American Tail 4: The Mystery of
the Night Monster,'' released this week by Universal, are bought by
the millions of copies. Obviously they have to meet certain
standards, but film criticism per se is essentially beside the
point. It is much more important that the movie fit a mold and take
its place in a series.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real key is to expand the franchises,'' said Ken Graffeo,
Universal's senior vice president for marketing. Video movies are
numbered: for example, the live-action ``Beethoven's 3rd,'' also
released this week, the animated ``Land Before Time VII: The Stone
of Cold Fire'' (coming this fall) and the live-action ``Dragonheart
2: A New Beginning,'' to be released Aug. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, direct-to-video has leaned toward the
exploitational. Now it has become a highly lucrative assembly line
of brand-name movies that are relatively cheaply produced and often
bland as vanilla for the family audience.
</P>
<P>
   Disney fanned the direct-to-video fires in the 1990s with ``The
Lion King II: Simba's Pride'' and ``The Return of Jafar,'' which
despite its lack of a numeral was the sequel to ``Aladdin.'' The
two films, made at a fraction of the cost of the big-screen
originals, are said to have brought in a total of $500 million.
Released in 1994, Universal's ``Land Before Time 2: The Great
Valley Adventure'' kicked off a series of video sequels that has
made $1 billion worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Are they good films? Critics jumped fairly hard on the two
Disney sequels, but that could have been expected, given the
illustrious reputations of their predecessors. Actually, the best
direct-to-video sequels have good to excellent production values
and are otherwise competent enough for what they do; please
children, prime the cash cow and perpetuate the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beethoven's 3rd'' is an example. A sappy, squeaky-clean tale
of mom, dad, sis and junior and the sloppy St. Bernard that goes
along on their vacation, the film gets the job done for the average
8-year-old. ``Beethoven 4'' is currently in production. (The real
Beethoven got up to nine, remember.)
</P>
<P>
   This fall Dreamworks will edge into direct-to-video for the
first time with ``Joseph: King of Dreams,'' an animated film based
on the biblical story of the favored son sold into slavery by his
envious brothers. The studio emphasizes that it is not a sequel or
part of a series. It also points out that viewers might make a
connection with ``Prince of Egypt,'' the studio's successful
big-screen feature last year, and that many of the same people
worked on both movies.
</P>
<P>
   Will those be associations enough? Dreamworks is promoting
``Joseph'' as if it were a theater release. ``Start six months out
to get a buzz,'' said Kelley Avery, the studio's head of worldwide
video worldwide.

   `MAGNOLIA'
</P>
<P>
   Paul Thomas Anderson's mosaic mixes a half-dozen lives into an
Altmanesque swirl. While the old television mogul Earl Partridge
(Jason Robards) lies dying and lamenting past indiscretions, his
young wife (Julianne Moore) quaffs his painkillers and wails about
her own infidelities. Then, to name a few, there are the morose
former child television-quiz-show star (William H. Macy), the
present whiz kid (Jeremy Blackman) and the strutting macho cult
figure (Tom Cruise, above). None of this jells, but, Janet Maslin
wrote in The New York Times, ``what Anderson lacks in substance is
offset by his great skill with actors, his gift for shaping
resonant little individual vignettes and his extraordinary
intuition.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1999. New Line. $108.77. 188 minutes. Closed captioned. R.

<P>
   `PUPS'
</P>
<P>
   A Bonnie and Clyde for the MTV generation, Stevie (Cameron Van
Hoy) and Rocky (Mischa Barton) interrupt their walk to school to
rob a bank. Angered by neglectful families, the teen-agers shoot a
guard, take hostages and talk about the ills of society. Among
their demands are a visit from MTV, margarita mix, condoms and an
end to smoking by the FBI commander (Burt Reynolds). Written and
directed by Ash (single name only), the film ``takes a knowing look
at adolescents informed but not educated by television and movies
in a less than perfect United States'' (Lawrence Van Gelder).
</P>

   2000. Monarch. $94.95; DVD, $19.95. 103 minutes. R.
</P>
<P>
   `ROMEO MUST DIE'
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for Shakespeare in Andrzej Bartkowiak's
hip-hop-kung-fu tale of greed and revenge. Isaak (Delroy Lindo)
intimidates waterfront business owners so he can buy up their
properties. Trish (Aaliyah) is his attractive daughter, and Han
(Jet Li, the Hong Kong action star) wants to avenge the killing of
his little brother. A sleek look and well-selected soundtrack
helps, but the movie is ``overly dutiful in dragging itself through
the exercise of playing out its plot elements, ignoring the chief
lesson of its Hong Kong antecedents: Extend the martial
gymnastics'' (Elvis Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   2000. Warner. $110.97; DVD, $24.98. 115 minutes. Closed

</P>
<P>
   `THE NINTH GATE'
</P>
<P>
   Who better than Frank Langella for the role of Boris Balkan, an
evil collector of devil-inspired antiquities? Johnny Depp is Dean
Corso, the rogue book dealer whom Balkan hires to locate a volume
called ``The Nine Gates.'' Could Satan have a hand in this one?
Actually, three versions of ``Gates'' are at stake, and Corso must
stay a step ahead of Liana (Lena Olin), a dangerous widow in black,
and a sylph (Emmanuelle Seigner). Trying for both fright and
satire, Roman Polanski's film ``is about as scary as a sock-puppet
re-enactment of `The Blair Witch Project,' and not nearly as
funny'' (Mitchell).

NEW AND NOTEWORTHY MOVIES 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   ``ALICE AND MARTIN,'' starring Juliet Binoche and Alexis Loret.
Directed by Andre Techine (R, 123 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Techine's sprawling, emotional love story is the kind of movie
that makes you work a little. It takes time to figure out the
relationships between the characters, to say nothing of their
motives and feelings. But like so many of Techine's movies, ``Alice
and Martin'' repays the effort. The unlikely, complicated passion
between Martin, the troubled illegitimate son of a wealthy
industrialist, and Alice, a brittle violinist, unfolds against an
equally complicated and sometimes overcrowded background of family
secrets and shifting domestic alliances. Binoche and Loret are
superb in the title roles (A.O. Scott).
</P>
<P>
   ``BUTTERFLY,'' starring Fernando Fernan Gomez and Manuel Lozano.
Directed by Jose Luis Cuerda (R, 96 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   This gentle, devastating new film, based on short stories by the
Spanish writer Manuel Rivas, tells the story of Moncho ( Lozano), a
sensitive young boy coming of age in the months before the outbreak
of the Spanish Civil War. The movie touches on the usual
excitements and mysteries of childhood, but Moncho's relationship
with his teacher, the proudly Republican Don Gregorio, beautifully
played by Fernan Gomez, gives the story an unusual degree of pathos
and political complexity (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   ``CHICKEN RUN,'' with the voices of Mel Gibson, Miranda
Richardson and Julia Sawalha. Directed by Peter Lord and Nick Park
(G, 86 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   The first full-length feature from Aardman Animation is
immensely satisfying, a divinely relaxed and confident film that
credits youngsters' interest in a cartoon more substantial than the
standard bland musical. The movie employs modeled latex figures to
tell the story of a group of chickens desperate to escape from a
chicken farm before they are turned into pies. Park, who also
directed the fabulous Wallace and Gromit shorts, transfers all of
the deftness and imagination of his shorter films into an artful
big-screen realization. And this briskly paced epic uses Lord's
continuing satirical take on British modesty and balmy superiority.
``Chicken Run'' parodies cultural touchstones from ``Stalag 17'' to
``Star Trek'' to the loose-cannon heroics of Gibson, the voice of
Rocky, the matinee-idol flying rooster who is asked to teach the
hens to fly. Finally it shows that the hens can save themselves
through the pluck of Ginger ( Sawalha) and doesn't make a big deal
of this. It's a great eggscape from banality (Elvis Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   ``CHUCK AND BUCK,'' starring Chris Weitz and Mike White.
Directed by Miguel Arteta (R, 95 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   At the center of Arteta's funny, creepy and poignant new film is
Buck, a 27-year-old man who inhabits the mental world of a
preadolescent boy. As played by White, who also wrote the
screenplay, Buck is needy and sensitive, an object equally of
sympathy and revulsion. The film chronicles his attempt to rekindle
his childhood bond with his old friend Charlie ( Weitz), who has
grown into a distant, self-absorbed careerist. Arteta's visual
sense, White's insightful script and strong supporting performances
from Weitz and his brother Sam, as well as from Lupe Ontiveros as a
kindly theater manager, make this one of the most unusual and
affecting coming-of-age stories in some time. ``Chuck and Buck'' is
an antidote to the current epidemic of lazy nostalgia for the
innocence of childhood and therefore, magically, one of the few
truly grown-up movies you're likely to see this year (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   ``DISNEY'S `THE KID, &UR; ''' &LR;  starring Bruce Willis, Lily Tomlin and
Jean Smart. Directed by Jon Turteltaub (PG, 101 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   In this cloying throwback to Disney's modest live-action
comedies of old, Willis plays a smarmy image consultant humanized
by his encounter with his 8-year-old self (Spencer Breslin), who
arrives in Los Angeles via a toy red prop plane. By rights the
movie should be dreadful, and it is thick with therapeutic cliches,
but it occasionally soars to heights of not bad, thanks to strong
performances from Willis, Tomlin and Smart, and to Audrey Wells'
surprisingly clever script (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE EYES OF TAMMY FAYE,'' directed by Fenton Bailey and Randy
Barbato (PG-13, 79 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Tammy Faye Bakker Messner, the former wife of Jim Bakker, is
that most American of stories, a figure of tragedy and a joke. This
documentary walks us through her life, a veritable catalog of bad
marriages, lost televangelist empires, squandered relationships
with children and, despite it all, indomitable optimism. ``The Eyes
of Tammy Faye'' cries out for a little more analysis of its
subject. Instead it joyfully wallows in the backdraft of her
excesses. The directors are awfully quick to forgive Messner's lack
of self-awareness, possibly because she has a heart as big as her
hair. She was one of the first in the televangelist crowd to accept
gay men with AIDS. The movie makes a case for her because she's a
survivor; it's more of a mash note than a formal documentary, and
there's nothing wrong with that (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   ``FREQUENCY,'' starring Dennis Quaid and Jim Caviezel. Directed
by Gregory Hoblit (PG-13, 100 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   ``Back to the Future'' meets ``Field of Dreams'' meets ``It's a
Wonderful Life'' meets ``The Sixth Sense'' in this entertaining but
shamelessly sentimental supernatural soap opera with a macho heart.
Caviezel is a morose young policeman who makes contact with his
dead father, a heroic firefighter, on a ham radio and contrives to
save him from the accident that cost him his life during the 1969
World Series. From here, the two collaborate on changing other
aspects of the past and on catching a serial killer. There are
enough testosterone tears to soak Shea Stadium (Stephen Holden).

 UNDATED: (Stephen Holden).  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``GLADIATOR,'' starring Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie
Nielsen, Richard Harris and Oliver Reed. Directed by Ridley Scott
(R, 150 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   This movie is the answer to a question no one bothered to ask:
what would happen if someone decided to film the imminent extreme
football league as if it were a Chanel commercial? Scott subjects
action-packed bouts of mayhem and decapitation in the Roman
Colosseum to his glossy, inhuman directing style; it is admirable
but repellent. As the noble Roman general who ends up fighting for
his life, Crowe gives a performance with ball-of-fire intensity
suffused with a movie star's impatience. He holds the movie
together, such as it is (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   ``GHOST DOG: THE WAY OF THE SAMURAI,'' starring Forest Whitaker.
Directed by Jim Jarmusch (R, 116 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   In his new film Jarmusch does for the samurai epic and the
gangster movie what he did for the western in ``Dead Man,'' his
dreamy, elegiac deconstruction of cowboys-and-Indians mythology.
Here he has composed a ruminative, bittersweet visual essay on
brutality, honor and tribalism, which may frustrate audiences
expecting more visceral thrills. ``Ghost Dog'' is worth seeing for
Whitaker's witty, moving performance as a modern-day samurai caught
up in a Mafia vendetta, for Jarmusch's offbeat sense of cinematic
style and for the hip-hop artist RZA's brilliant musical effects
(Scott).
</P>
<P>
   ``GROOVE,'' starring Hamish Linklater, Lola Glaudini, Mackenzie
Firgens and Steve Van Wormer. Directed by Greg Harrison (R, 86
minutes).
</P>
<P>
   If you're nostalgic for chasing down a rave gig across the city
and arriving to find a pair of 16-year-olds discussing the merits
of drum and bass versus jungle, then this mostly knowing and funny
comedy is just the film for you. Even if you're not, its seductive
lack of pretension will win you over. ``Groove'' is a comedy of
moments, tracking a crowd through the ups and downs of one night of
pleasure at a rave. Harrison and his team don't try to pretend that
raves are anything new or dangerous. Rather, they're an entrenched
circuit with specific tribal complications, and this genial picture
captures them (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   ``LOSER,'' starring Jason Biggs, Mena Suvari and Greg Kinnear.
Directed by Amy Heckerling (PG-13, 93 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Admirers of Ms. Heckerling's movies _ notably ``Clueless'' and
``Fast Times at Ridgmont High'' _ may be disappointed in her latest
effort, a romantic comedy about two college students who overcome
the snobbery and cruelty of their surroundings to find true love.
The script could have used a few more drafts and a less perfunctory
climax, but Heckerling's characteristic wit and intelligence is
still in evidence. Fine performances by Biggs as the title
character, Suvari as the girl of his dreams and Kinnear as a sleazy
literature professor help make ``Loser'' more enjoyable than most
recent youth-targeted date movies (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   ``ME, MYSELF AND IRENE,'' starring Jim Carrey and Renee
Zellweger. Directed by Bobby Farrelly and Peter Farrelly (R, 100
minutes). If ``There's Something About Mary'' offended you with its
callous mockery of hair and pet care and its whimsical views of
stalking and serial killing, then this latest festival of vulgarity
from the Farrelly brothers will make you miserable. But ``Me,
Myself and Irene'' shares with their earlier movies a kind of
dopey, boyish sincerity and a good-natured sympathy for the
underdog that may prove capable of winning over even the dourest
spirits. Carrey, in one _ or is it two? _ of his most charming and
repellent performances, plays a Rhode Island state trooper with a
split personality and a giant crush on Irene, played with winning
moxie and plausible bewilderment by Zellweger (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   ``M:I-2,'' starring Tom Cruise, Thandie Newton and Anthony
Hopkins. Directed by John Woo (PG-13, 120 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Cruise returns as the daredevil secret agent Ethan Hunt in Woo's
loud, flashy, incoherent new blockbuster. The film is jampacked
with movie references _ to Hitchcock, to the first ``Mission:
Impossible'' movie and to Woo's earlier, and superior Hong Kong
action films _ but it's at once overheated and flat. The plot,
involving killer viruses, is baffling rather than twisty. The
introduction of a love interest ( Newton) who also happens to be
the bad guy's ex-girlfriend adds an element of melodrama that's
more grating than affecting. Some good car chases and explosions,
though (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE PATRIOT,'' starring Mel Gibson and Chris Cooper. Directed
by Roland Emmerich (R, 158 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   A grueling Revolutionary War epic that, at more than two and a
half hours, seems to take place in real time. The brutality and
sentimentality are effective, though the film will leave you
feeling used as you exit the theater. This sort-of prequel to
Emmerich's ``Independence Day'' stars Gibson as a gentle farmer who
leads the Colonies in wresting freedom from the Brits, using
counterintuitive methods alarmingly similar to terrorism. His
anguished masculinity is brandished like a musket. The film's chief
asset is his relationship with the young actors playing his
children; it draws on the actor's real-life feeling about his own
large brood, and his work with them is stirring (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE PERFECT STORM,'' starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg,
Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, John C. Reilly and Diane Lane.
Directed by Wolfgang Petersen (PG-13, 130 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Impressive but monotonously redundant special effects smother
the human drama in this true story (adapted from Sebastian Junger's
best-selling book) of a group of swordfishermen battling ``the
storm of the century'' off Massachusetts in 1991. Clooney is the
ship's glowering, enigmatic captain, and Wahlberg and Lane are the
appealing lovebirds who lend the movie its stingy quotient of
warmth. The early scenes, which paint a romantic portrait of the
fisherman's life in Gloucester, Mass., promise a great deal, but
the movie becomes waterlogged once it leaves shore (Holden).

 UNDATED: shore (Holden).  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``ROAD TRIP,'' starring Breckin Meyer, Seann William Scott, Amy
Smart, DJ Qualls and Tom Green. Directed by Todd Phillips (R, 91
minutes).
</P>
<P>
   ``National Lampoon's Animal House'' meets ``There's Something
About Mary'' in this gross-out farce. Four college boys led by Josh
( Meyer) embark on a desperate 1,800-mile journey from upstate New
York to Texas to intercept an X-rated dorm room video mistakenly
sent to Josh's loyal girlfriend in Austin. The fun is all in the
gags, among them the notorious French toast sequence, the
envelope-pushing sperm bank scene and the hilarious
car-jumped-over-the-bridge demolition derby. You'll laugh despite
yourself (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``RULES OF ENGAGEMENT,'' starring Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L.
Jackson. Directed by William Friedkin (R, 123 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   The two powerhouse actors muster all the technique they can
bring to bear for this by-the-numbers courtroom drama with flashes
of bruising action: it's like the world's most expensive episode of
``JAG,'' with bits of ``The Verdict'' mixed in for extra flavor.
Jones plays a shaky, alcoholic Marine lawyer brought in to defend
his fellow marine ( Jackson) against charges of military
misconduct. Since ``Rules'' makes it clear from the outset that
Jackson's character is innocent, the only suspense comes from
wondering whether Guy Pearce, as the prosecutor, will be able to
maintain his bizarre accent (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   ``SCARY MOVIE,'' starring Jon Abrahams, Carmen Electra and
Shannon Elizabeth. Directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans (R, 88 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Wayans' latest genre-film spoof doesn't so much lampoon the
``Scream'' movies as offer the latest remake, this time as
gross-out comedy. ``Scary Movie'' abounds in crude, often stale
jokes involving male genitals, female pubic hair, flatulence and
dismemberment. There are a few hilarious moments, and some that
will provoke guilty laughter, but Wayans hasn't quite figured out
how to parody movies _ like the wildly popular ``Scream'' series _
that already parody themselves (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   ``SHAFT,'' starring Samuel L. Jackson, Vanessa Williams, Jeffrey
Wright, Christian Bale, Toni Collette and Richard Roundtree. A
sequel/remake to the 1971 semiclassic, starring the always
dependable Jackson. He plays the nephew of the original Shaft
(Roundtree), and this time, Shaft is a cop. He leaves the force to
track down a racist WASP murderer (Bale), who joins forces with a
drug dealer (the flamboyant and skillful Wright) to eliminate the
hero. This may be the least politically correct movie in some time,
and though it tries to convert archetype into stereotype, it
doesn't succeed. Watching the two villains squabble for center
stage is like watching Luciano Pavarotti and Placido Domingo in a
death match for the mike. But Jackson comes out on top of this
emptily entertaining hodgepodge of retro and modern cliches
(Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   ``SMALL TIME CROOKS,'' starring Woody Allen and Tracey Ullman.
Directed and written by Allen (PG, 95 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   The sweet, funny wisp of a movie starts out as a parody of ``Big
Deal on Madonna Street,'' then turns into a child's-eye ``Bonfire
of the Vanities'' before returning to its original mode as a caper
comedy. Allen and Ullman are Ray and Frenchy Winkler, an inept
thief and ex-con and his upwardly mobile wife, whose cookie
business takes off and allows her to indulge her dream of being a
Park Avenue hostess. If the movie suffers severely from attention
deficit disorder, the jokes are funny (but mild) and the screwball
comic tone is impeccably sustained. Ullman (putting on her Fern
Rosenthal voice) and Elaine May (as Frenchy's dimwitted cousin) are
delightfully goofy (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``SUNSHINE,'' starring Ralph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz, Jennifer
Ehle, Rosemary Harris and James Frian. Directed by Istvan Szabo (R,
180 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   In Szabo's tale of 20th-century Hungarian history, Fiennes plays
three members of a wealthy Jewish Budapest family _ grandfather,
father and son _ who endure the corruption of the Austro-Hungarian
empire, the viciousness of Fascism and the brutality of Communism.
Fiennes' performances and those of Ehle and Harris (playing the
same character at different stages of life) help save the film from
melodramatic excess. Even though much of the story is crudely told,
``Sunshine'' is a serious, humane and thought-provoking attempt to
make sense of complicated and painful historical experiences
(Scott).
</P>
<P>
   ``WHAT LIES BENEATH,'' starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison
Ford. Directed by Robert Zemeckis (PG-13, 130 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Zemeckis' film takes its time in laying out the story of
high-strung Claire ( Pfeiffer), who is dissolving into hysteria on
a regular basis. Her daughter has just gone off to college, and
Claire is still recovering from the trauma of a car accident. Then
her house starts showing signs of being haunted. Her husband,
Norman ( Ford), is a driven research scientist with a secret. This
thriller is as implausibly chilling as any ``X Files'' episode. By
the last 10 minutes your interest will have long vanished
(Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   ``X-MEN,'' starring Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Hugh Jackman,
Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Halle Berry and Anna Paquin. Directed
by Bryan Singer (PG-13, 105 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   The long-awaited arrival of Marvel Comics' do-gooder mutants is
mildly fun on a couple of levels: for one, the acting duel between
Stewart (as the mutant telepath Prof. X, the X-Men's leader) and
Ian McKellen (as the mutant nemesis Magneto, who possesses the
power of supermagnetism). As these two austere hams trill their
vowels at each other you get the feeling you really are watching
members of another species in action. And Jackman scores as the
two-fisted, confrontational Wolverine, a mutant with superstrength,
an ability to heal all wounds and metal-alloy claws that shoot out
from his knuckles. He lives to fight, a boisterous tragic hero with
no complications. Otherwise the movie is an earnest affair that is
clumsy when it should be light on its feet; it takes itself even
more seriously than the comic book does, though its fans may be
overjoyed by that devotion (Mitchell).

EMMYS HAVE A HISTORY OF SNUBBING THE WORTHY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Drew Carey'' and ``Emmy'' had never been mentioned in the same
sentence until last season when the comic actor wrapped an entire
episode around being dissed by Emmy voters. The series hasn't had a
shot at winning the best comedy category because it's never earned
a nomination. At least Carey can take solace in the knowledge that
he runs with pretty good company.
</P>
<P>
   Some of television's most notable talents have come up dry on
Emmy night. Gracie Allen. Buddy Ebsen. Arthur Godfrey. Jack Paar.
Peter Graves. Ozzie Nelson. Martin Landau.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ed Sullivan Show'' was named best variety series in 1955,
but Sullivan himself never won.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Gleason and Andy Griffith were consistently passed over,
although their comedic sidekicks, Art Carney with Gleason's ``The
Honeymooners'' and Don Knotts with Griffith's self-titled series,
won five Emmys apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roseanne'' was never nominated as best comedy during its
nine-year run, and it wasn't until recently that Emmy voters found
the charming CBS series ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' worthy of
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't explain why many of the same, familiar faces
are nominated year after year in the acting categories. When John
Larroquette kept winning for ``Night Court,'' Candace Bergen for
``Murphy Brown'' or Bill Cosby for ``Cosby,'' it became so
ridiculous that Cosby yanked his name from consideration. (Did
``Frasier'' deserve to win five consecutive times?)
</P>
<P>
   The fact that ``Homicide: Life on the Street'' continually
failed to make the cut (Andre Braugher finally got the nod) and
safe, familiar, standard dramas like ``Chicago Hope'' did, was
indicative of Emmy voters' thinking.
</P>
<P>
   There have been other blunders with Emmys, such as the year
``Lonesome Dove'' lost in the miniseries category to ``War &AMP;
Remembrance,'' or when Lindsey Wagner of ``Bionic Woman'' knocked
off Sada Thompson of ``Family'' as best actress.
</P>
<P>
   Other classic snubs:
</P>
<P>
   _ Kyle Secor, ``Homicide'': Never nominated, which is astounding
considering that he probably had the most involved development of
any character on TV during his final three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   _ Scott Wolf, Neve Campbell and ``Party of Five'': Fox's
reputation as a tasteless, opportunistic network usually kills the
chances of any series that it airs. Older voters probably still
consider Fox a new network.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Roseanne'': Perhaps the most noticeable snub, ``Roseanne''
achieved a rare feat by being highly regarded by critics and
viewers. The comedy series spent most of its existence in the top
10, two of those years as the country's No. 1 program. In nine
years, it never received an Emmy nomination.
</P>
<P>
   _ Angela Lansbury, ``Murder She Wrote'': Lansbury may have been
hailed four times for her work on Broadway, but she's racked up 16
Emmy losses for a series voters simply found too weak dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sarah Michelle Gellar and ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'': It
doesn't matter that ``Buffy'' is well-written and well-crafted (its
``Hush'' episode was the best of any show this year); it skews
young and appears to be outside the range of Emmy voters.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Drew Carey'': For one or two years, this was one of the best
five sitcoms on air. But Carey is much like Roseanne: too
blue-collar for typical Emmy tastes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jane Leeves, ``Frasier'': Playing the love interest of David
Hyde Pierce's Niles on the hit sitcom has probably kept voters from
taking her seriously as a stand-alone for supporting actress.
</P>
<P>
   _ Patrick Stewart, ``Star Trek: Next Generation'': Stewart often
seemed overqualified for this role, but Emmy's oversight here
wasn't about his performance _ it was his show they didn't
particularly respect.

<P>
   In the new movie ``What Lies Beneath,'' Michelle Pfeiffer sees a
dead person before the opening credits are over. At a crowded
preview screening, viewers jumped, even though they knew what they
were in for. Throughout the movie, they jumped, sometimes screamed,
again and again, as director Robert Zemeckis threw out scares that
were often red herrings, but sometimes weren't.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer's box-office clout jumped, too. ``What Lies Beneath''
grossed $29.7 million in its opening weekend. According to the
Internet Movie Database, you'd have to go back to ``One Fine Day''
in the spring of 1997 to find a Pfeiffer movie that grossed more
than that in its entire run.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``What Lies Beneath's'' opening-weekend gross was
higher than the initial-weekend numbers for Pfeiffer's past five
starring movies combined. And yeah, you could credit that to
co-star Harrison Ford, but pairing him with a female star hasn't
proved lucrative in the recent past, as the lackluster performances
of ``Random Hearts,'' ``Sabrina'' and ``Six Days, Seven Nights''
indicate.
</P>
<P>
   No, it was fear that lured moviegoers to ``What Lies Beneath'' _
or, more accurately, the hope that they'd be in for a pretty good
scare. ``What Lies Beneath'' comes nearly a year after ``The Sixth
Sense,'' another (far superior) ghost story that created tingles on
the backs of viewers' necks. And with Sam Raimi's ``The Gift,''
about a psychic trying to divine the whereabouts of a missing girl,
due out this fall, movies about the supernatural are undergoing one
of their periodic resurrections.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are misfires (last year's well-made ``Stir of
Echoes'' had the double misfortune of having limited distribution
and arriving at nearly the same time as ``The Sixth Sense'') and
fiascoes (last year's ``The Haunting'' and ``The Haunting of Hill
House''), supernatural-themed movies appear to be with us for
eternity. Why we _ well, those of us who aren't too chicken _
continue to go to them can be a bit puzzling. After all, being
scared isn't necessarily a pleasant feeling. Is it?
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to see the dark side to be sure it exists,'' says
Donald Pritchett, director of purchasing at the Web site DVDempire
and a self-described longtime horror-film aficionado. ``There is
something about a horror film that lets us see what is out there
from the safety of our own environment. ... Look at what we gain
from horror movies: the adrenaline rush; the possibility of closer
proximity to someone who is more scared; they let us exorcise what
we sometimes wish we could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all movies _ or TV shows _ about the supernatural
are frightening. Check out the metaphysical aspects of ``Touched by
an Angel,'' ``City of Angels'' (the movie, not the TV show), ``What
Dreams May Come,'' ``Meet Joe Black'' or even ``Ghost.'' Many of
these _ successfully or not _ strive for more than does ``What Lies
Beneath,'' which aims for nothing more than to be a Hitchcock
homage/hodgepodge, what Pauline Kael called a ``boo movie'' because
it has little more ambition than to make you jump.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt ``What Lies Beneath'' got a big opening-weekend boost
by looking similar in mood to ``The Sixth Sense,'' the mega-popular
ghost story about a troubled little boy who sees dead people.
``Sense'' sailed to the all-time box-office Top 10 partly on the
strength of a key plot twist, but even more because the movie
connected with people in a way most metaphysical-themed films
don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what really struck a chord with `The Sixth Sense' is
it really looked at the question of what happens to you after
you're dead,'' said Frank Myer, president of the Dallas
Screenwriters Association. ``Everybody, on some level, worries
about that: people who believe in God, heaven or hell, but also
people who don't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What Lies Beneath'' doesn't play off of such deep themes, but
it does keep alive the notion of a restless spirit _ someone who
suffered an injustice while living and wants to correct it with the
help of someone still alive. The movie actually has more in common
with ``Stir of Echoes'' than ``The Sixth Sense,'' even though they
all share a similar plot thread.
</P>
<P>
   `` `The Sixth Sense' was a whole different kettle of fish,''
says John W. Hesley, an Arlington, Texas, psychotherapist and
co-author (with his wife, Jan) of ``Rent Two Films and Let's Talk
in the Morning.'' ``It was a real dialogue between the living and
the dead. It wasn't just that a dead person comes back and helps a
living person out, but the living person was helping the dead
person as well.''
</P>
<P>
   To a point, Cole, the haunted boy played by Haley Joel Osment in
``The Sixth Sense,'' is frightened by what he encounters. Claire,
Pfeiffer's character in ``What Lies Beneath,'' is more curious
about what the restless spirit is after _ she even (at a
psychiatrist's recommendation) has a seance. Laurel Clark, the
international secretary of the School of Metaphysics in Windyville,
Mo., says that this behavior is a manifestation of something we all
have within us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has intuitive abilities,'' Clark says. ``I think
that's the primary reason people go to these movies. (The
abilities) exist and they're real and everybody has them, and we're
able to go these movies and find out about them. People need to use
them more.''
</P>
<P>
   Fear-inspired adrenaline, spiritual angst and latent intuition
aside, though, herds of ghostly white horses couldn't drag some
people to a horror movie, no matter how benevolent. Some people
find real life to be scary enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it depends on everyone's personal makeup,'' says
Philip Eisner, a Fort Worth native who wrote the screenplay to the
underrated 1997 science-fiction/horror movie ``Event Horizon,''
which explored far darker terrors than are examined in ``What Lies
Beneath'' or ``The Sixth Sense.'' ``My father's family had escaped
from Eastern Europe during World War II, so my father never wanted
to see a war movie or a scary movie. He wanted movies like `E.T.'
His idea of an escape was a happy movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisner is a longtime fan of horror and science fiction (he's
gearing up for a four-hour Sci-Fi Channel update of Stephen King's
``Firestarter,'' due next year). He believes that the key to a
successful horror movie is simple: Give us somebody we can identify
with.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I thought was so interesting about `The Sixth Sense' was,
my wife didn't think it was scary at all,'' Eisner says. ``She said
she thought it was interesting. But it scared the hell out of me. I
was never worried about (Cole) dying. I was frightened of what he
might see next. When there's a character you're very sympathetic
to, that can make for a very frightening experience.''

PBS SPECIAL CHRONICLES LIFE OF MAVERICK SOUTHERN PREACHER
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Note language in second graf) 
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By JIM JONES 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. Will D. Campbell's one-sentence definition of
Christianity may be a little blunt, even irritating, to some.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all bastards, but God loves us anyway,'' declares
Campbell, an iconoclastic champion of civil rights and maverick
Baptist preacher who will be featured next month on a public
television special, ``God's Will,'' produced by the University of
Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   We can learn much from Campbell, an earthy spiritual gadfly and
master of one-liners who preaches a Christianity of unconditional
grace.
</P>
<P>
   He steps on toes with every comment. For example, he refers to
TV evangelists as ``electronic soul molesters.''
</P>
<P>
   When I first met Campbell, he wore a black Amish-style hat and
cowboy boots to indicate the Anabaptist-pacifist and fiery rustic
roots of his fellow Southern Baptists. He carried a hand-carved
cane.
</P>
<P>
   He has taken off the black hat. But he's still the same Will.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell has made waves since the 1960s when he and two other
ministers walked beside Elizabeth Eckford as she and eight other
black teen-agers, braved angry, shouting mobs as they walked into
all-white Central High School in Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, he had been fired as campus minister of the University
of Mississippi, where he had spoken out against racial injustice.
When he held a reception for both blacks and whites, someone put
human feces in the punch bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell was the only white person at an Atlanta meeting when
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights leaders
formed the Southern Christian Leadership Congress. He downplays his
role in the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like Dr. King had personally invited me,'' he said.
``But it is true I was the only white there.''
</P>
<P>
   When I previewed the television special, I fondly remembered a
spring day in the late 1980s when I drove over a hilly, tree-lined
road to Campbell's 40-acre farm at Mount Juliet, Tenn., east of
Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   He was wandering around his place, which gave the title to
``Forty Acres and a Goat,'' one of his 15 books. He fed a stray dog
that had wandered up to his log-cabin office, and had found a new
home.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell welcomes stray dogs, celebrities, country music stars,
famous novelists, civil rights activists and reporters _ just about
anybody _ to his home. It is a part of his ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Back in his log-cabin office, I took photos as he carried on his
daily routine, answering phone calls from Amnesty International and
other organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he drove me through the hills to a tavern for lunch.
Everyone knew him there. He plays his guitar with the band there on
Friday nights and sings country songs that he said he believes have
much to do with the religious soul of the South.
</P>
<P>
   The television special calls the tavern Campbell's church. He
marries and buries the people who come there.
</P>
<P>
   He speaks frequently across the nation and has been the subject
of four books, including ``Will Campbell: Soul of the South'' by
Thomas L. Connelly. The black-hat-wearing minister, Will B. Dunn,
in Doug Marlett's comic strip ``Kudzu'' is based on Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell loves the South, even though he was berated by many
fellow Southerners as he sought to promote racial justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The South was wrong, but it's my South,'' he says in the TV
special, which is narrated by Ossie Davis. The initial broadcast is
scheduled for 9 p.m. Aug. 25 on PBS.
</P>
<P>
   Ordained as a Baptist preacher in his hometown of Liberty,
Miss., at the West Fork Baptist Church, Campbell remembers
preaching his first sermon looking at a huge pulpit Bible presented
years earlier by the Ku Klux Klan and inscribed with the letters
``KKK.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell was a child when the Klansmen, dressed in full regalia,
came to the church. When KKK members presented the Bible,
Campbell's father, Jesse Campbell, walked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why he did it,'' Will Campbell says. ``I guess
there was something in his genes that said, `This isn't right.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Former President Jimmy Carter, United Methodist minister and
civil rights activist Jim Lawson and country music stars Tom T.
Hall, Waylon Jennings and Jessi Colter eulogize Campbell during the
special.
</P>
<P>
   Carter describes Campbell as a ``deeply religious man; one who
has a great deal of spirit _ calm, wise, witty, eloquent.''
</P>
<P>
   But Campbell takes it all in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why it's such a big deal,'' he says. ``I get
notice. I get press. I get awards. But I'm just one more Marine. I
haven't been a big man in any movement. I'm not sure I've had a
ministry. I've had a life. To me it's all a celebration. I like it.
I do believe in priesthood of the believer _ that we are all
ministers to one another.''

   MIDEAST-CLINTON (Jerusalem) _ President Clinton, seeking to

on Israel television to heap praise on Barak, promising rewards for

GHOST STORIES BECOME LOST SOULS IN FILMMAKING PROCESS
</HEADLINE>
 
 (EDS: Accompanies SCARY MOVIES)  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ROBERT PHILPOT 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A person is contacted by a spirit. The spirit wants something,
but what it wants is unclear. Meanwhile, ``things'' jump out of the
darkness _ sometimes, it's only a dog, but sometimes it's a little
more unnerving. Doors open without being touched. Nightmares
interrupt sleep. Breath becomes visible. Disembodied voices moan
and cry.
</P>
<P>
   If you've seen a ghost story during the past few years, chances
are you've seen all of that _ especially if you watched the
recently released ``What Lies Beneath.'' It sounds easy to conjure,
but screenwriters say that horror films are less formulaic than
they might appear on the surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like they're a little bit harder to write,'' says Frank
Myer, president of the Dallas Screenwriters Association. ``Because
you're creating another world where you have to establish rules,
and follow them through the end.'' Myer says that one reason ``The
Sixth Sense'' worked so well is that M. Night Shyamalan's
screenplay followed rules that supported the crucial plot twist
(''What Lies Beneath'' isn't so good about this).
</P>
<P>
   Films are a collaborative process, though, and sometimes good
intentions get lost in the collaboration, for instance when the
writer loses control of the screenplay as it goes through the
studio-producer-director wringer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard for me to say how challenging writing horror
is,'' says Philip Eisner, a Fort Worth native credited with the
screenplay for 1997's sci-fi chiller ``Event Horizon.'' ``Very
rarely does a screenplay make it to the screen intact. `The Sixth
Sense' had the advantage of the writer and director being the same
person. So you had a writer/director and you had a very powerful
star (Bruce Willis) willing to stand up for the material.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisner, a longtime horror buff, says that he wasn't so lucky
with ``Event Horizon,'' in which a crew of astronauts encounter a
malevolent presence in space.
</P>
<P>
   ``The studio was very afraid of the original script,'' he says.
``They thought it was too smart. So they said to take out some of
the science stuff and put in more of the sort of satanic stuff.
They never complained about too much gore, though. So instead of it
being a very intelligent mugging of the audience, like `Seven,' it
was a very dumb mugging. But it was still effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Myer nor Eisner, though, says that horror writers are
simply cutting corners _ nor, for that matter, do they believe that
of writers of any genre.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really love writing this stuff,'' Eisner says. ``It's just a
natural place where I'm comfortable. I don't think anyone goes out
to write a horror movie because it's a cheap and easy thing. If it
were, more people would do it.''

AT THE MOVIES: NEW TRANSLATION FOR `RIFIFI'; THE NEW ZEMECKIS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE KEHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Usually, asking a director when he first encountered
Stanislavsky is not a question about a literal meeting, but Jules
Dassin has a literal answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man himself? Shall I tell you? It was in 1923, when the
producer Morris Guest brought the Moscow Art Theater to New York. I
was a boy, and I saw this with my own eyes. John Barrymore was
playing `Hamlet' at that time, and he had heard of Stanislavsky and
his great actors. And it seems he cut big chunks out of his
`Hamlet' that night to run and see some of the Moscow Art Theater.
He made his entrance still dressed in his inky black Hamlet
costume, and rushed up to the stage and kissed the feet of the
director and the actors. I saw that!''
</P>
<P>
   Dassin, a vigorous 89, was in New York recently to introduce the
rerelease of ``Rififi,'' the classic caper film he made in France
in 1955, after the blacklist forced him to leave Hollywood. ``The
title comes from the North African tribe, the Rifs, who were in
constant conflict,'' he said. ``So it's all about melees and
conflicts and fighting, out of which the novelist Auguste Le Breton
made the word `rififi.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He went on to write `Rififi in Tokyo,' `Rififi in San
Domingo,' `Rififi in Flatbush' and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   Translating 1950s underworld slang into subtitles for 2000 posed
a problem for Dassin, who worked with Bruce Goldstein (whose
company, Rialto Pictures, has released the film in the United
States) and the journalist Lenny Borger to create a new English
text.
</P>
<P>
   ``Breton's characters spoke a very special language, and one
unknown to many parts of France outside of the Paris circle,''
Dassin said. ``When I was given the book to read, I understood
nothing of it. It was a very special argot, and I should not be
surprised if he invented some of it. To know what the book was
about, I had a guy read it to me who was a specialist.''
</P>
<P>
   Dassin, born in Middletown, Conn., and raised in the Bronx,
landed in Europe after the director Edward Dmytryk named him in the
hearings by the House Committee on Un-American Activities into
communist influence in Hollywood. Having specialized in film noir
in Hollywood (``The Naked City,'' ``Brute Force'') Dassin returned
to the genre for his first film in France, and it became a
worldwide hit.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964 he went back to the form for ``Topkapi,'' with its
famous high-wire burglary scene _ a sequence that Dassin was
surprised to find re-enacted without acknowledgment in Brian De
Palma's 1996 ``Mission: Impossible.'' ``That shocked me,'' he said.
``I think it was just too literal, the same thing. I said, `Is this
allowed?' Apparently it was.''
</P>
<P>
   After shooting ``Rififi'' in Paris, Dassin discovered Greece,
where he met and married the actress Melina Mercouri, who starred
in his 1960 film ``Never on Sunday'' as well as ``Topkapi.'' Athens
remained his home after her death in 1994. ``I stopped working
right after my wife died, to continue on with some of the
unfinished projects she undertook when she was the Greek minister
of culture. We've created a foundation in her name. And I'm trying
to get a museum built. There are wonderful educational projects in
schools, with fascinating results. That's all my time now.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Zemeckis
</P>
<P>
   One of the handful of Hollywood filmmakers still able to put a
personal stamp on his work, Robert Zemeckis made his name with big,
broad comedies like ``Back to the Future'' and ``Who Framed Roger
Rabbit.'' But since ``Forrest Gump'' in 1994, a more melancholic
strain has appeared in his films. His last two features,
``Contact'' (1997) and the current ``What Lies Beneath,'' are both
about emotionally isolated women whose attempts to break through to
others lead them to relationships, possibly hallucinated, with
otherworldly beings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someday, some scholar is going to be able to line up my movies
and watch the arc of my life,'' Zemeckis, 48, said by telephone.
``There's some thread in there about understanding the importance
of being able to develop an emotional intimacy with other people,
and the wall you come up against from time to time. It's usually
within yourself, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What Lies Beneath'' is a suspense thriller, ``written in the
language of Hitchcock,'' said Zemeckis, about an unhappy housewife
(Michelle Pfeiffer) who finds that an unwelcome entity has joined
her marriage with Harrison Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``You begin to understand more complex characters as you build
up some years,'' Zemeckis said. ``I couldn't have made this movie
15 years ago, and I couldn't have made `Contact.' That's why I
think it's important to take these little sabbaticals in between
movies. If you're not careful, just making movie after movie can
isolate you too. It's a very isolating job; even though you go all
over the world and you do all these things, it's a very, very
unrealistic way of living.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been no sabbatical for Zemeckis lately. ``What Lies
Beneath'' was made while the director was waiting for Tom Hanks to
lose weight and grow a beard for his role as a plane crash survivor
living on a desert island in ``Cast Away,'' which is to be released
at Christmas.

<P>
   ``We did the first two-thirds of `Cast Away,' and then we
stopped,'' the director said. ``I rolled the crew onto this movie,
and then rolled them back on to the end of `Cast Away,' which is
the only way I could have done it, because no one except David Lean
could stop the camera for 30 days. No one can afford to do that, so
I had to figure out an economical way, and one way was to make a
whole other movie.''
</P>
<P>
   For Zemeckis, ``Cutting for comedy and cutting for jolts is the
same. It's all timing, which ultimately comes down to individual
frames. It's exactly like leading the audience to the punch line.
You can literally be off by half a second and it won't be as
effective.''
</P>
<P>
   An Iranian's Themes
</P>
<P>
   Abbas Kiarostami's acclaimed Iranian film ``The Wind Will Carry
Us'' opens in New York on Friday accompanied by ``Kiarostami 101,''
an instructive 20-minute short assembled by the film scholar
Jamsheed Akrami. With brevity and wit, the short sketches out the
characteristic themes and images of Kiarostami's work, which many
critics place among the most beautiful being produced today.
</P>
<P>
   Akrami, who is an associate professor of film at William
Paterson University, first wrote about Kiarostami's work in the
early '70s, when the director was making films for Kanun, the
Iranian government's Institute for Intellectual Development of
Children and Adolescents. Then came the revolution, and Akrami
found a six-month visit to the United States turning into a 22-year
stay.
</P>
<P>
   There's more where these 20 minutes came from. ``When I
interviewed Abbas,'' Akrami said, ``I shot six hours of video, and
we only talked about his first two films. There's a lot more to
cover.''

DANCE REVIEW: AN INTEGRATION, IN BLOOD AND DANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The French modern-dance choreographer Mathilde
Monnier has been a major link to emerging experimental dance in
Africa. ``Pour Antigone,'' which she choreographed in 1991, is the
final dance event in Lincoln Center Festival 2000, and it is a
landmark work in this new cross-pollination.
</P>
<P>
   During much of ``Pour Antigone,'' which had its New York
premiere on Wednesday night at La Guardia High School, two sets of
dancers keep apart. The first group consists of performers from
Africa: three female and two male dancers and a virtuoso drummer.
The white performers in the second group include a male American
dancer and four Europeans (three women and one man).
</P>
<P>
   That those groups are eventually integrated, even in partnering,
is not only predictable; it is also symbolic of a theme that is
highly oblique, as is common to Monnier. On another level,
integration signifies unity, possibly even the catharsis associated
with the Greek myth of Antigone, daughter of Oedipus and Jocasta.
</P>
<P>
   Antigone is nowhere to be seen onstage, but she is sensed in her
multiple aspects. Monnier's springboard was Sophocles' tragedy
``Antigone,'' whose heroine buries her slain brother Polynices in
defiance of her uncle, Creon, ruler of Thebes, who considers him a
traitor. After Creon condemns her to be buried alive in punishment,
she commits suicide.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Pour Antigone,'' which will be repeated riday night and
Saturday at La Guardia High School (100 Amsterdam Ave., at 64th
Street), the highly individualized performers keep changing
costumes. Eventually all wind up in shades of red. Can one say that
the integration of the groups into a unified whole relates to a
blood ritual? The same red blood courses through the veins of all
mankind. The healing at the end has the casual style of the piece's
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Like much of Monnier's work, this one is open to interpretation
or even no interpretation. Its weakness is paradoxically its
strength: discrete episodes have impact, but their cumulative
aspect is questionable.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some people in the audience called the work wonderful _
which is true of the energy and wit found in specific moments.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Pour Antigone'' Monnier began a collaboration with
dancers she met in Mali and Burkina Faso. Some went to France to
study in workshops with her company, now based in Montpellier, and
joined her troupe or returned home to form troupes of their own.
</P>
<P>
   This is true of her two male dancers from Burkina Faso, Salia
Sanou and Seydou Boro, whose company performed in September at the
International New Dance Festival in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   The revelation of that festival was the number of choreographers
in Africa who use their background in traditional dance to
experiment in contemporary ways. Monnier was one of the first to
encourage their postmodern brand of eclecticism, which also runs
through ``Pour Antigone.'' Among others who studied with her is
Gnapa Beatrice Kombe, whose stunning Tchetche Co. in Ivory Coast
was also in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald K. Brown, who has worked with the Sylvain Zabli Co. in
Ivory Coast, and Ralph Lemon are American experimental
choreographers who have collaborated with African dancers. The
German neo-expressionist Susanne Linke will include dancers from
Senegal when her company, Jant-Bi, appears at the Jacob's Pillow
Dance Festival in Becket, Mass., from Aug. 9 to 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pour Antigone'' can thus be seen in a context that Monnier did
much to create. It is to her credit that she has not turned her
African collaborators into clones of her white performers, who move
in the stylized collage structures she inherited from her American
mentor, Viola Farber, once Merce Cunningham's partner.
</P>
<P>
   The work opens with a striking decor by Annie Tolleter,
corrugated walls lighted by Eric Wurtz and with costumes by
Christine Vargas. Two women pursue a long-distance dialogue at
opposite corners of the stage. Their African syllables are
emphatic, often repetitive. Blandine Yameogo, who also sings
occasionally, and Balguissa Zoungrana, sitting under a lamp, are
very much of our time. They lounge on abandoned car seats.
</P>
<P>
   After they begin a stamping dance, varied in gait and postures,
the three European women _ Corinne Garcia, Germana Civera and
Eszter Salamon _ rush out in short tunics and clunky shoes to stamp
out their geometric minimalist reply.
</P>
<P>
   The contrasting dynamics are obvious: outlined shapes for the
Europeans, performed with darting speed, while the self-contained
African solos have the looser dynamic of traditional African dance
and are packed with steps.
</P>
<P>
   Weaving throughout the work is Zani Diabate, a drummer of nuance
and humor who triumphs over the electronic rumbles of Christophe
Sechet and who ushers in Boro as a kingly figure. Sanou, something
of a Polynices, haunts the piece like a spirit with a resiliency in
his dancing that is amplified by the rest of the cast as it lies on
the floor and bounces up from it.
</P>
<P>
   Awa Kouyate, a woman who closes the piece in a healing water
ritual, moves with elegance, and Joel Luecht, the American, appears
occasionally wrapped like a mummy in white cloth. Dimitri Chamblas,
tall, quick and able to carve every shape into space with power and
energy, is a galvanizing force.
</P>
<P>
   When Monnier brings in four toy soldiers to be moved around the
floor, and Luecht stands on the head of a soldier figure, her
references to colonial or postcolonial rule take the wind out of
her wonderful chaotic sails. Herman Diephuis is listed as assistant
choreographer for a piece that nonetheless meanders in and out of
magic places.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's just say that golf is not my sport. First of all, my
hand-eye coordination is bad enough that I still button my shirt
wrong. Second, the idea of getting up at dawn for anything is out
of the question. And third, do I have to even say it? Those
clothes! Bathroom wallpaper with collars for the women, not to
mention lime green pants for the men, with navy whales _ or ducks _
embroidered on them. And all in the name of a sport, to hear
evotees describe it, that is the ultimate contest of man versus
himself. Well, here's a news flash. With ducks on your pants, you
just lost. Both of you.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why I wasn't surprised last week at the Poxabogue Golf
Center in Bridgehampton, N.Y., when a woman on the driving range
took one look at Claudia Romana and said loudly to her pro: ``Who
is she? I like her shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   She and everyone else. Romana, 36, is one of a new breed of
golfwear designers who realize that the women who wear Armani in
the boardroom have no intention of taking to the course dressed
like Emmett Kelly. There is also a new generation of Tiger Woods
disciples, young urbanites (read from minorities) and increasing
numbers of women, who are coming to the game with no frame of
reference for country club frump. And where there's a market, there
are companies like Gucci, Prada and Tommy Hilfiger all jumping on
it. In that regard, Romana's timing is impeccable: this is her
second season in a business where demand for her simple, elegant
clothes designed mostly in neutral tones instead of pastels has
steadily grown. The line, sold under the label Golf by Claudia
Romana (www.golfbycr.com), is also affordable: capri pants,
trousers, skorts, tops and dresses sell in the $55-to-$85 range.
</P>
<P>
   Rona Cherry, editor in chief of Golf Digest Woman, said the
changes in wardrobe were long overdue: ``Golf clothes have been
totally out of sync with fashion. We've noticed a big change this
year with more form-fitting clothes, cutout backs. At the U.S.
Women's Open, Pearl Sinn, a young Korean player, was wearing a
white sheer top and you could see the bra. Today, you don't have to
be stuck with Bermuda shorts anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Romana takes it even further. ``Golf clothes should look like
streetwear but still be active,'' she said. ``So many of these
companies think golfers have naturally bad taste, selling all that
canary yellow and powder puff blue. I was playing with an
attractive woman recently who looked like a mad bird-watcher. I
said, `Honey, let me help you.' You have to have all your senses
together to play golf.'' Which Romana does diligently, at this
course among others, public and private, in the New York
metropolitan area. I joined her here to `play Pox' as people say of
this hip public course, which despite _ or maybe because of _ its
inherent democracy, attracts celebrities like Cindy Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   On this particular day, Romana was by far the best-dressed woman
around, in her stone-colored capri pants and black top with white
piping and tee holders, which are her trademark. She was also
wearing men's black Nike shoes. ``I like them better than the
women's,'' she said. ``I think the white ones look dorky and they
make your feet look huge.''
</P>
<P>
   Her designs include a detachable pouch for balls, so that
form-fitting outfits stay that way. Despite my better judgment, I
put on a skort (a combination of shorts and skirt _ think culottes)
and a top. I looked like a quasi-hip suburban mom. The good news
was that the skort's accommodating stretch made it almost as comfy
as a pair of pj's.
</P>
<P>
   But as Romana stepped up to the first hole to practice her
swing, I had that sinking sensation from gym classes past and knew
I'd never make it, no matter what I was wearing. A couple appeared
behind us. The woman was dressed in Gap khakis and a white T-shirt
and looked as miserable as I did. I brightened. ``I'll try to be
fast,'' I said, and she shook her head. ``Don't worry, I'm not
good,'' she said. I smiled. ``It's hard to be worse than me.'' She
grimaced. ``I'll give it a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Romana, looking like an advertisement, hit her ball
into the wild blue yonder. The most I can say for myself was that I
was brilliant _ had we been playing miniature golf.
</P>
<P>
   After butchering the first hole, I decided that to truly test
the give in the skort, I needed to sit down immediately, preferably
with an iced tea. The woman behind us looked longingly as we turned
tail and headed for the restaurant, a superior vantage point, I
decided, to scope out the general state of golf course fashion. It
was truly ghastly. The women looked like boxy boys, in long baggy
shorts and long short-sleeved T-shirts. Romana agreed. ``I can wear
my golf trousers on the plane, just take the pouch off, and they're
fine,'' she said. ``If you're afraid to stop and get gas on the way
to the course, you're wearing a funny outfit. If it screams golf,
it's not comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Michael Caruso, editor in chief of Maximum Golf, a new monthly
magazine, agreed, when I reached him by phone. ``As golf has gotten
younger, with the advent of Tiger Woods,'' he said, ``it has also
gotten sexier. For the first time, 57 percent of players are under
40. Younger men don't have the gender barriers that older guys
have, the ones who are usually playing to escape their wives.
There's a lot more flirting out on the course. People are finding
golf sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   So much so that Maximum Golf will sponsor a singles event, Golf
in the City, at Chelsea Piers on Sept. 21. ``It'll be like an
episode of `Sex in the City' with golf clubs,'' Caruso predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Still, golf has not become as oversexed as say, tennis, whose
professional players, like Anna Kournikova, have recently been
criticized for wearing skimpy outfits. ``Golf is not about showing
panties,'' Cherry said. ``For four hours you've got to feel
comfortable and look good, a woman first and foremost.''
</P>
<P>
   Why has golf's fashion revolution taken so long? ``Women had
other battles to fight,'' she explained. ``We had to get on the
course first, and once we were there, we wanted to fit in. Look at
the working world in the 70's, with women wearing the suits and
bow-tie blouses. But now, the clothes are sophisticated, sporty and
functional.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as Romana points out, the country club culture still
holds sway in the golf world. ``A lot of clubs are restrictive
about dress codes,'' she said. ``General dress code is collar or
sleeves for women and men both, and in some clubs men have to wear
pants, no shorts. Regulation length has to hit no more than two
inches above the knee. I had much shorter things, which people
liked, but they can't wear them in their clubs. And a lot of them
require that the clothes carry their logos.'' She shrugged. ``Does
everyone really want to look like a souvenir?''
</P>
<P>
   Though Romana has a solid handle on her market, she has only
lived here for 12 years. Originally from Germany, where her parents
own a resort hotel, she was introduced to golf by a former
boyfriend during a trip to Portugal. ``I couldn't afford to play in
Germany because you had to be a member,'' she said. ``I found an
antique set of wooden clubs at a flea market and practiced in my
backyard at 5 a.m.''
</P>
<P>
   Romana (she uses her mother's maiden name) has had a variety of
fashion jobs in New York, including designing men's wear for J.
Crew. One of her happiest discoveries here has been public courses,
not only for the joy of playing, but to build her client base. She
has never advertised, relying instead on word of mouth, and women
seeing how good she looks. Beside her Internet business, she has
started doing trunk shows at country clubs, and a dozen club pro
shops now carry her line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of my customers are professional women who have to go on
company outings,'' Romana said. ``One customer said, `I can't play,
but they all loved me because I looked good.''' She smiled. ``I
always say, `I can't promise to improve your game but I can promise
you'll look better no matter how you play.'''
</P>
<P>
   Well, even if all you're doing is drinking iced tea, that is the
American way, isn't it?

   The following stories will move in the `l' category for release
Sunday, July 30.
</P>
<P>
   IBIZIA-DISCOS (Ibizia, Spain) _ Ibizia has become a clubhoppers
destination resort. There are billboards advertising discos, a
disco bus whose drivers play techno and disco package tours. Many
come here to capitalize on the availability of party drugs like
Ecstasy and Special K, but its the dance-driven decadence, the
perpetual parties and the carnivalesque clubs that are the main
attraction. Es Paradis is home to Fiesta del Agua in which the
dance floors are flooded with water. At Amnesia, the dance floor is
flooded with foam. But the best is Privilege, where last Monday
night more than 10,000 people attended a spectacle that included
midgets on stilts, Brazilian feather dancers, Puerto Rican
strippers from New York and visual distractions that include three
dozen disco balls, a wall of water and a two-story Buddha. By Jesse
McKinley.
</P>
<P>
   NITEOUT-WEBSTER (London) _ A niteout in London with Stephen
Webster, a jewelry designer, and Anastasia, his Russian-born wife.
They run into Count Andrei Tolstoy (an offshoot of the writer's
family), Jacob Dzhugashvili, an artist and great-grandson of Joseph
Stalin; Nash Tavkhelidze, godson of the former Russian Prime
Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov, and lead singer of Blast, the first
Russian band to be signed to a British label. ``What a bizarre
party,'' Webster observed.
</P>
<P>
   GOLF-FASHION (Undated) _ Alex Witchel dons a skort and
interviews Claudia Romana, one of the first golf fashion designers
to realize that women who wear Armani are not going to the course
dressed as Emmett Kelly. With photos NYT 9 and 10.
</P>
<P>
   SUITS-IRONY (Undated) _ The suit is becoming a default uniform
for the hip, but it has to be worn with a sense of irony, reports
Bob Morris. Spike Jonze, the director of ``Being John Malkovich''
is a suit guy. So is the skateboarder-turned-art dealer Aaron Rose
and when Keanu Reeves recently played a gig here with his rock
band, Dogstar, it was in a dark suit by DKNY. Then there's Mike
Mills, who has directed videos and ads for Nike and the Gap. He
wears Brooks Brothers suits. ``People expect a hip and edgy guy to
be wearing stuff from Banana Republic, and it throws them off and
puts me in a more powerful position,'' he said. ``It's the most
punk thing I can do right now.''
</P>
<P>
   JUNGER-BAR (New York) _ Sebastian Junger, the bestselling
author, has opened a bar in Manhattan. Though the Half King has
been billed as a throwback to the old-school writer's haunt, this
one has a movie business buzz to it partly because two of the
co-owners are from the movie business and partly because the film
version of Junger's book, ``The Perfect Storm,'' is a current hit.
There's little doubt that the bar's main attraction _ from the
feminine perspective, at least _ will be Junger, who has become
nearly as famous for his book jacket pose as for his
disaster-at-sea prose and who was even featured in 1997 as People
Magazine's ``Sexiest Writer Alive.'' By Douglas Century.

THE BIBLE, AS HISTORY, FLUNKS NEW ARCHAEOLOGICAL TESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Bible's account of King David is so well known that even
people who rarely crack the Good Book probably have an idea of his
greatness.
</P>
<P>
   David, Scripture says, was such a superb military leader that he
not only captured Jerusalem but also went on to make it the seat of
an empire, uniting the kingdoms of Judah and Israel. Thus began a
glorious era, later amplified by his son, King Solomon, whose
influence extended from the borders of Egypt to the Euphrates
River. Afterward, decline set in.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what if the Bible's account doesn't fit the evidence in the
ground? What if David's Jerusalem was really a rural backwater _
and the greatness of Israel and Judah lay far in the future?
</P>
<P>
   Lately, such assertions are coming from some authorities on
Israel's archaeology, who speak from the perspective of recent
finds from excavations into the ancient past. ``The way I
understand the finds, there is no evidence whatsoever for a great,
united monarchy which ruled from Jerusalem over large
territories,'' said Israel Finkelstein, the director of the
Institute of Archaeology at Tel Aviv University. King David's
Jerusalem, he added, ``was no more than a poor village at the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Statements like these have earned Finkelstein _ who is leading
excavations at Megiddo, a vitally important site for biblical
archaeology in northern Israel _ a reputation as a fascinating but
controversial scholar. His reports from Megiddo that some
structures attributed to Solomon were actually built after his
reign have touched off fierce debate in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Within a larger context, what he says reflects a striking shift
now under way in how a number of archaeologists understand Israel's
past. Their interpretations challenge some of the Bible's
best-known stories, like Joshua's conquest of Canaan. Other finds
have turned up new information that supplements Scripture, like
what happened to Jerusalem after it was captured by the Babylonians
2,600 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview by e-mail from the Megiddo site, Finkelstein
said that not long ago, ``biblical history dictated the course of
research and archaeology was used in order to `prove' the biblical
narrative.'' In that way, he said, archaeology took a back seat as
a discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that it is time to put archaeology in the front
line,'' said Finkelstein, the co-author with Neil Asher Silberman
of ``The Bible Unearthed,'' to be published in January by The Free
Press.
</P>
<P>
   His reference to past practices can be illustrated by a remark
by Yigael Yadin, an Israeli general who turned to archaeology and
who once spoke of going into the field with a spade in one hand and
the Bible in the other.
</P>
<P>
   Many archaeologists, both before and after the founding of the
modern state of Israel, shared a similar approach: seeking direct
evidence for biblical stories. This outlook was shaped either by
their religious convictions or their Zionist views, said Amy
Dockser Marcus, the author of ``The View From Nebo'' (Little
Brown), a wide-ranging and engaging book that describes in detail
the shift in archaeology taking place in Israel. The problem with
that outlook, she said, is that ``you can't help but go in and look
at material and interpret material in a certain way.'' And that,
she added, ``led to certain mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   In her book, Marcus _ formerly the Middle East correspondent for
The Wall Street Journal _ notes that Yadin believed he had
unearthed evidence in the ruins of a place called Hazor that
corroborated the biblical account of how that Canaanite city had
been destroyed. The Bible says Hazor fell to invading Israelites
led by Joshua.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, she said, an increasing number of archaeologists
have come to doubt that Joshua's campaign ever took place. Instead,
they theorize that the ancient Israelites emerged gradually and
peacefully from among the region's general population _ a
demographic evolution, not a military invasion. ``And that would
explain how their pottery is so similar to the Canaanites', and
their architecture, their script,'' Marcus said.
</P>
<P>
   Finkelstein makes the same argument: ``Archaeology has shown
that early Israel indeed emerged from the local population of late
Bronze Canaan.'' In addition, he said, archaeology has turned up no
physical remains to support the Bible's story of the Exodus:
``There is no evidence for the wanderings of the Israelites in the
Sinai desert.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how such conclusions have been received in Israel,
Finkelstein replied that they have been producing a ``quite strong
and negative'' reaction. But the anger, he said, was coming not
from strictly Orthodox Jews (``who simply ignore us,'' he said) but
from more secular Jews who prize the biblical stories for their
symbolic value to modern Israel. ``I think that the young
generation _ at least on the liberal side _ will be more open and
willing to listen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, considerable disagreement exists among archaeologists on
how to interpret many recent finds. And the new theories about
ancient Israel are emerging against the backdrop of a raging
dispute over the biblical ``minimalists,'' a group of scholars who
argue that biblical accounts of early Israel, including the stories
of David and Solomon, have little, if any, basis in history.
</P>
<P>
   (This debate was recently fought out in a lively issue of the
Biblical Archaeology Review, a bimonthly magazine published in
Washington, in which one of the minimalists, the British scholar
Philip Davies, wrote that biblical accounts of early Israel were
purely theological, not historical. In response, a major critic of
the minimalists, the American archaeologist William Dever, wrote
that ample physical evidence pointed to early Israelites living in
the region's highlands 3,200 years ago, two centuries before the
time of David and Solomon.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But if many archaeologists are far less interested in trying to
corroborate the exact biblical accounts than in how the area's
ancient history fits into the larger picture of the Middle East,
that change of perspective, Marcus said, reflects an intellectual
shift among the people doing the digging. Many current
archaeologists, she said, were born in modern Israel and don't need
a link to the biblical King David to think of themselves as part of
the Israeli nation: ``They see themselves as part of the broader
Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet while archaeology is challenging some of the biblical
narrative, it is also adding to it. At Megiddo, Finkelstein said,
he found that the period 2,900 years ago _ the century following
the rule of Solomon _ was a far more interesting and powerful time
for the Kingdom of Israel than the Bible says. Another tantalizing
discovery, in 1993, turned up a stele with an inscription referring
to the ``House of David,'' the first real evidence that refers to
the biblical king. Still other recent excavations have provided
compelling new evidence about the lives of the residents of
Jerusalem 2,600 years ago, when they were besieged by the
Babylonian army, and about the nearby people of ancient Judah who
did not go into exile in Babylon.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus said that such discoveries illustrate how archaeology can
restore information ``left on the cutting room floor,'' as it were,
by those who compiled the biblical narrative. ``Archaeology is
giving you back all this history,'' she said. ``So archaeology
doesn't just deconstruct the Bible, but reconstructs it.''

&HT;     DALLAS READY FOR ITS FIRST TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BRENT ZWERNEMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS _ Like 30 other NFL squads in training camp _ when
even teams like the Bengals prepare for the postseason _ Dallas
Cowboys owner Jerry Jones believes his team can win it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at those veterans coming in, and you look at the
speed and skill of the younger players who have never won one of
those Super Bowl rings, and they've got all of that fire and
ambition to do it,'' Jones said Thursday. ``Boy, I like that
combination.''
</P>
<P>
   How good are the Cowboys, circa 2000? They'll begin finding out
7 p.m. Sunday when they play host to the Pittsburgh Steelers at
Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   And like any camp, there's been a few surprises and
disappointments through the first two weeks. Here are some of both
in a position-by-position analysis of the Cowboys headed into the
first preseason game.
</P>
<P>
   OFFENSE
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback: Troy Aikman hasn't played in a Pro Bowl since 1996,
and will turn 34 this season. That said, Aikman seems genuinely
enthused about the new weapons in his offense and a return to a
timing-based offense he helped make so successful in the mid 1990s.
Backup Randall Cunningham is 37 but hasn't lost any zip on his
pass, although his scrambling abilities have slowed a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Running back: Emmitt Smith isn't showing any signs of slowing,
and with a healthy couple of years could break Walter Payton's
career rushing record. (He has 13,963 yards to Payton's 16,726.)
His backup, Chris Warren, has shown signs of moodiness after
starting so many years in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Fullback: Robert Thomas has settled into this position after
fighting for a roster spot as a backup linebacker less than a year
ago. Aikman said Thomas has shown some of the same instincts as his
predecessor, Daryl ``Moose'' Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver: Joey Galloway hasn't had a huge season yet in the NFL,
but Cowboys fans are thinking this might be the one. Galloway, long
known for his physical tools, earned a reputation in Seattle as
aloof and selfish. He's shown no signs of either through two weeks
of training camp. Now if Aikman's passes can keep up ... Raghib
``Rocket'' Ismail is coming off his best season as a pro (80
catches for 1,097 yards) and opposing defenses ought to be outright
alarmed at the idea of he and Galloway streaking down the field at
once.
</P>
<P>
   Tight end: Free-agent addition Jackie Harris, who's a slim 247
pounds, gives Aikman a weapon at tight end he hasn't had since Jay
Novacek retired in 1996, that of an agile, big receiver who can
outrun linebackers. Starter David LaFleur is in his fourth season,
and at 6-foot-7 might be best as a big goal-line target.
</P>
<P>
   Center: Aikman said he'd retire if Mark Stepnoski retires. No
one knew if he was kidding. Stepnoski, 33, gives the offensive
line, still missing Erik Williams, veteran stability and
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Right tackle: In Williams' absence, the Cowboys moved projected
right guard Solomon Page to right tackle, which is more of his
natural position, and where he would have played when Williams
retired.
</P>
<P>
   Right guard: This is the biggest concern on the offensive line,
since Page was moved. The Cowboys are banking on the experience of
Jorge Diaz, who hasn't been particularly impressive so far.
</P>
<P>
   Left guard: Pro Bowler Larry Allen is out a couple of weeks with
a broken right hand, possibly a blessing in disguise since
seldom-used backup Kelvin Garmon is getting better daily at the
position.
</P>
<P>
   Left tackle: Flozell Adams, 25, is in only his third season but
at 335 pounds is a force. Last year he switched from guard to
tackle, and continues to improve at protecting Aikman's blindside.
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSE
</P>
<P>
   Left end: Ebenezer Ekuban has added 90 pounds to his bench press
and should improve upon his 33 tackles of a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle: Chad Hennings is a consistent force, having
started the past 39 games for the Cowboys. Hennings' aggressiveness
is underrated.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle: Alonzo Spellman continues to amaze his
teammates and coaches with his consistent and tough play following
off-the-field troubles a couple of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Right end: This spot is reserved for Greg Ellis, who was
becoming one of the premier ends in the league when he broke his
leg with three games left last season.
</P>
<P>
   Middle linebacker: Some consider the jury out on Dat Nguyen, who
earned the starting slot when Randall Godfrey signed with
Tennessee. He's considered small at 5-foot-11 and 231 pounds. The
Cowboys signed 245-pound veteran Barron Wortham to contend with
Nguyen.
</P>
<P>
   Weakside linebacker: Does anyone remember that Dexter Coakley
earned All-Pro honors last year? He was just the second Cowboys
linebacker in 17 years to make the Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Strongside linebacker: Incumbent Darren Hambrick is getting a
serious run from veteran Joe Bowden, who signed with the Cowboys
from Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Right cornerback: The Cowboys weren't sure what they were
getting by signing Ryan McNeil.
</P>
<P>
   So far he may be the camp's most pleasant surprise, and he leads
all defensive backs in practice interceptions by a wide margin.
</P>
<P>
   Left cornerback: Kevin Smith, 30, simply isn't what he used to
be, though the coaching staff has shown lots of confidence in the
veteran the first couple of weeks. Rookies Mario Edwards and/or
Kareem Larrimore may get a starting shot if receivers keep getting
past Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Strong safety: Like Coakley, Darren Woodson is good enough that
you forget he's back there. And don't suggest he's gonna have to
step up his leadership role with Deion Sanders gone to Washington.
Woodson says he's been a leader all along.
</P>
<P>
   Free safety: George Teague, finally given the opportunity to
start at the beginning of the season, responded with 102 tackles
last season. Secondary coach Bill Bates is relying heavily on
Teague and Darren Woodson to lead the young guys in the coming
weeks.

COMMENTARY: A DRESSING-DOWN FOR THE KHAKI-CLAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 30)  
 By BOB MORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Here's an ad campaign I'd like to see right now:
Everybody in suits.
</P>
<P>
   Not khakis. Not guayabera shirts. Not capri-length cargo pants
that might be useful for clam digging on Long Island Sound. But
suits. With ties, please, and proper shoes that get a little
uncomfortable after a long day at the office. As a guy who works at
home and has skirted financial stability for years (a self-declared
underwear writer who can go days without shaving), I don't think
it's fair to have so many people so concerned with making money in
such comfortable clothes. I mean, let's face it: If you're consumed
by business, then you're a suit, and you should look like one. This
would not only improve the quality of civic life in what is now a
nation of people in athletic gear and pajamas, but also make those
of us who can't afford fancy mountain bikes, surf shacks and treks
to the Himalayas feel a lot better for not being wealthy e-people.
</P>
<P>
   A suit is the hair shirt I want every new-media mogul and
mini-maverick to be wearing right now, in the heat of summer, when
it's particularly unpleasant to be overdressed.
</P>
<P>
   Some have already seen the light and embraced the suit as a
default uniform. But they have done so as a form of irony, not
penance. Spike Jonze, the impossibly cool young director of ``Being
John Malkovich,'' who could take lunches in a bathing suit at Spago
if he felt like it, is a suit guy. So is the
skateboarder-turned-art dealer Aaron Rose, of the Alleged gallery
in New York, and when Keanu Reeves recently played a gig here with
his rock band, Dogstar, it was in a dark suit by DKNY.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Mike Mills, who has directed hip videos, including
ones for Moby and Pulp, and ads for Nike and the Gap. ``I'm an old
skater, and it became too predictable to dress like one,'' he told
me, ``especially when everybody else has co-opted that look in such
a specious way.'' The young Mills wears Brooks Brothers suits,
which perplexes his peers, especially when he's out in the dusty
hills scouting locations.
</P>
<P>
   ``People expect a hip and edgy guy to be wearing stuff from
Banana Republic, and it throws them off and puts me in a more
powerful position,'' he said. ``It's the most punk thing I can do
right now.'' The only time it makes Mills uncomfortable to be in a
suit and tie is when he's in the presence of guys in suits and ties
who are wearing them without irony. ``When I'm with an agent or
lawyer, that's when it gets weird,'' he said, ``and I feel like
ripping my suit off and relieving myself right there in his
office.'' He sounds like a fun guy, even if he has a strangely
contrived and convoluted logic about his suit-wearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a reference to Ralph Nader, who wears suits, but not in a
dandy-ish way,'' he said. ``It's an anticorporate statement.''
Exactly how he reconciles anticorporate with directing Gap ads is
anybody's guess. But never mind. This is a metaphysically modular
moment, when you can be the philosophical embodiment of all kinds
of things simultaneously, as long as you're young and thin enough.
</P>
<P>
   Omar Walker, for example, is the 29-year-old founder of
BlackPlanet.com and an Internet analyst on CNBC. He wears
conservative suits and has dreadlocks that cover his back. But
unlike Mills, he is not dodgy about making the money and running
with it, even if his parents are ex-hippies who still question the
merits of a capitalist culture. ``A suit makes you seem more
substantive, and that's a quality I want to convey,'' Walker said,
``even if I make everyone else in the office look bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Will these young players save the suit and bring it back from
the brink of extinction? Will they inspire my friend Steven to take
the Armani suits he threw into the trunk of his car (he doesn't
have enough closet space) and hang them up properly again? Will
these guys, whom I'll call the New Suits, help the newly casual
Brooks Brothers find its way back to its former place of stodgy
ruling-class authority? Will they cause a run on the inventory at
the Salvation Army Thrift Store on Eighth Avenue, where David
Tufts, a managing director at CIBC Oppenheimer, dropped off 20 fine
suits not too long ago because he had no room or use for them
anymore? Will my friend Stuart, an advertising executive with DDB
Worldwide, regret cutting up his 200 ties?
</P>
<P>
   The fashion world, always ready to predict, pronounce and sell,
sell, sell, is poised for the counterrevolution. Last month, USA
Today reported that recent surveys are linking casual attire with
casual work attitudes, and predicted that corporate dress codes are
due for a spruce-up. There's even a campaign among retailers to
push ``dress-up Thursdays.'' The August issue of Esquire makes a
case for more casually tailored suits with a ``techno-modern''
construction that's cool enough for young Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   And for women, suits are making a comeback this fall, too.
Steven Brunnar, who sells at the downtown boutique Jeffrey,
attributes this to the fact that suits are sexy clothes that don't
demand anemic body sizes and that serve, like armor, to hide
physical flaws. Katherine Betts, editor in chief of Harper's
Bazaar, on the other hand, attributes this reversal of fashion to
the fact that strong women are now looking for clothes that
reinforce their positions of power. Me? I'll attribute it, if it
happens, to the same fashion cycle that has taken us from pegged to
slouchy trousers in less than five years and is sure to push the
denim that came in from the cold out the door in no time flat.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm not criticizing. If you worry that being forced back
into suits (where you belong) will squash your anti-establishment
identity, why not take a cue from a wild and woolly friend of mine
who left a commune years ago for a job on Wall Street? When an
office colleague observed that they were wearing the same suit, he
said, ``Yeah, but I bet you're wearing underwear.''

 UNDATED: hiring attack.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   And a spokeswoman from the American Management Association,
which tracks workplace practices, said it is not just managers who
want to keep pay secret _so do many employees.
</P>
<P>
   Allison McAfee, director of communications for the Service
Merchandise Co., said that had been the reasoning behind her
company's written pay-confidentiality policy. ``It's not so much to
prevent employees from telling others, as asking others what they
make,'' she said, adding that nosy employees can be a nuisance to
their colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Service Merchandise, a Nashville, Tenn.-based retailer, dropped
its policy after a saleswoman who was fired for discussing wages
filed a complaint with the NLRB. A three-judge panel in 1990
rejected the company's arguments that it had to keep wages secret
to protect employee privacy, and to compete in the Tennessee labor
markets, and ordered the retailer to offer the saleswoman her job
back and post a notice that it was rescinding the ban.
</P>
<P>
   Randel K. Johnson, vice president for labor and employee
benefits at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, questioned the need for
new legislation, arguing that if fear of firing were really such a
big problem there would be more suits, under the existing laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laws shouldn't be amended just because somebody thinks it's a
good idea,'' Johnson said. ``Laws should be amended because it's
been shown there's a compelling national reason. If anybody's been
fired for this, I've never heard about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Employees confronted with confidentiality rules often worry that
if they complain they will only make matters worse. Still, some
take the plunge.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Tracy Jones of Milwaukee found work through a
temporary employment agency, preparing furniture and appliances for
shipping. One day, she overheard her male co-workers chatting about
what good pay they were getting for such easy work, so she asked
them what they made. She was shocked to learn they all were paid
$1.12 an hour more than she was, even though they all came from the
same temp agency, MaxStaff Employment Services, and none had more
seniority.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, now 33, said she went to MaxStaff, and asked why she, the
only woman, was being paid less than all the men. The supervisor
told her that she was wrong, that no one was paid more than she
was. When the employees assembled for their van ride to the
warehouse the next day, Jones recalled, the MaxStaff supervisor
laid down the law: If they discussed their pay, they would be
fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured I could talk about anything I wanted to talk
about,'' Jones said, so she waited until the boss was out of
earshot, then challenged the men to prove they were paid more than
she was. Some of them gave her their pay stubs, which she took to
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Jones was fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``How is that legal in America?'' asked Jones, whose EEOC
complaint is still being reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for MaxStaff's parent, Maximus Inc. of Mclean,
Va., said she was not aware of Jones' situation, but said Maximus
has no corporatewide policy against revealing pay. (She added that
MaxStaff was a pilot venture and would be closed by the end of this
month because it did not fit within the Maximus business model.)
</P>
<P>
   After her dismissal, Jones said she tried to talk other MaxStaff
women into filing complaints, but without success. ``They were
encouraging me to do it, but they didn't want to do it themselves
because they didn't want to get fired,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Craig, the former nursing home cook, said she had much the same
experience. ``I tell you, there's not very many that'll fight
back,'' she said. ``They know no one else will hire them if they
take a company to court.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, after the center fired Craig _ giving her no reason for
the termination _ she started looking for a new job, and
encountered applications asking if she had ever sued an employer.
Craig said she answered truthfully and found a new job anyway.
</P>
<P>
   She said she would not have known she could file a complaint if
it had not been for her husband, who owns a small oil-drilling
business and has had to learn a smattering of labor law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept saying, `It ain't right! It ain't right!' And my
husband, from his experience, knew just who to call,'' she said.
Last year the NLRB ruled that the nursing home must reinstate her
and pay her back wages, less the money she has earned in her new
job. This month a federal appellate court affirmed the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Webster, the lawyer who represented the nursing home,
said his client had complaints about Craig's work and believes it
dismissed her lawfully. The ruling, he added, involves only a small
amount of money: about $3,000, after deducting Craig's earnings
from her new job.
</P>
<P>
   In an age of multibillion-dollar tobacco verdicts, that is small
potatoes, but Craig said she did not sue for the money. Nor does
she want her old job back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be afraid to take it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Craig said she sued to make a point. In response to her
complaint, the labor board has ordered the nursing home to post a
sign on its bulletin board, stating that employees are free to
discuss pay if they wish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every employee can read it, whenever they want,'' Craig said.
``That's what I want.''

JEWELER'S DAILY REGIMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 30)  
 By JAMES COLLARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ ``What are you doing here?'' Stephen Webster demanded
in gravelly tones as he arrived at the opening party on a recent
Tuesday for One Fine Thing, a new boutique in St. John Street, in
Clerkenwell. He was greeting an old friend _ not the store owner,
but the doorman, Danny Moore, an elderly gent of military bearing,
apparently moonlighting from his day job at Goldsmith's Hall, home
of the Worshipful Co. of Goldsmiths.
</P>
<P>
   Webster is one of London's most innovative jewelers, a favorite
of clients like Madonna and Kate Winslet, but as a member of the
Goldsmiths, an ancient London guild, he is honored by his more
traditional peers. In a city where parking spaces are more valued
than any celebrity clientele, Moore is the man who lets Webster
park his motorbike in one of the Goldsmiths' four coveted parking
spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Webster, 40, goes to openings and parties several nights a week
after working long days in his workshop, making bold, big,
one-of-a-kind designs that have made him a darling of accessories
editors at fashion magazines on both sides of the Atlantic. ``It's
part of the job, really,'' he explained of his day-into-evening
schedule. ``It's like a game, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   His first port of call had been the opening of a Georgian art
show at a gallery in Cork Street, Mayfair. There, he and his
Russian-born wife, Anastasia, found themselves greeting one old
acquaintance, Count Andrei Tolstoy (an offshoot of the writer's
family) and making a new one, Jacob Dzhugashvili, an artist and
great-grandson of Joseph Stalin. Nash Tavkhelidze, godson of the
former Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, was also on hand _
he's the lead singer of Blast, the first Russian band to be signed
to a British label.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a bizarre party,'' Webster said, laughing, to a friend,
Neil Cunningham, a couturier. In the sultry weather, the party had
moved onto the sidewalk, where the Websters mingled with scions of
White and Red Russia, Georgia and the fashionable London art crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Count Tolstoy's a wonderful guy,'' Webster said, as his wife
fluttered from guest to guest in a feather-fringed dress like some
exotic, especially sociable little bird, one moment speaking
Russian, the next Italian or English. The count organizes London's
War and Peace Ball (``I'd go, only they do all that old-school
dancing and you've got to have lessons,'' Webster said), which
helped finance the building of the rather grand Russian Orthodox
church, blue onion domes and all, that is currently astounding
visitors on the road from Heathrow. ``He got hold of two kilos of
caviar _ at an amazingly good price _ for our wedding, and a band
of balalaika players,'' Webster said.
</P>
<P>
   After a flurry of good-bye kisses, the Websters and Cunningham
squeezed into a car to head across town to the boutique. Soon it
was time to head farther east to a cousin's party in a loft
apartment in newly fashionable Shoreditch.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Webster explained something of his life story:
apprenticeship in London, long stays in Canada and Santa Barbara,
Calif., before returning to London and opening his store in Duke
Street in 1996. His reputation is spreading well beyond this
prestigious Mayfair address; Webster's workshop is working flat out
to fill orders from Bergdorf Goodman in New York.
</P>
<P>
   At the party, after a quick climb to the roof to survey this
lively corner of the old East End, Webster suggested they go
dancing. His wife's answer was a gentle but convincing no. It was
getting late, and there was work to do in the morning.

 &HT;    A whinnying ride through rural Quebec
 &HT;    By Sandra Eckstein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUEBEC PROVINCE, Canada _ After horseback riding through deep
green forests all morning, our group of 10 breaks into a field lush
with barley ready for harvest. We weave along the edge of the
grain, then cross a piece of downed fencing into a clover-covered
field.
</P>
<P>
   It's a beautiful fall afternoon, and we are enjoying it as part
of a five-day, inn-to-inn ride through the rural Gaspe Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Then the horses suddenly tense, as if anticipating a change. The
group's leader, Yves Pruneau, gives a signal _ raising his index
finger heavenward and thrusting it forward _ and the horses begin
racing up a nearby clovered hill.
</P>
<P>
   A tiny Canadian-bred black horse is one of the fastest. And
Nicole Bell, a 23-year-old former riding instructor from Boston, is
happy to let her go.
</P>
<P>
   Lady tears up the hill, eclipsing every other horse. Nicole
throws out her arms and whoops. As we crest the hill, Nicole
embraces Lady's neck and kisses her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I can die happy,'' she laughs. ``That's always been a
fantasy of mine, to run through a gorgeous field of flowers with no
hands.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a trip meant to fulfill such fantasies. It's 100 miles
of intense riding through all types of terrain and constantly
changing tempos. No lolling in the saddle, where you're another
piece of baggage being hauled by a bored horse.
</P>
<P>
   The guides are Pruneau and his wife, Heather. Yves is a former
plumbing contractor who followed his heart back to horses, having
grown up with them on his family's Quebec farm. Heather is a former
banker who gave up city life in Toronto after meeting Yves on a
ride.
</P>
<P>
   Yves worries about the horses, Heather the guests. They're a
good team.
</P>
<P>
   Every night, the ride ends at an inn, bed-and-breakfast or small
hotel. The accommodations and food range from basic to luxurious,
with the added benefit of getting to know French Canadians in their
own homes.
</P>
<P>
   But the main attraction is the horses. Riders spend five to
seven hours a day in the saddle astride well-trained,
well-cared-for mounts. It's easy to stay focused because Yves
constantly changes the rhythm, alternating from walks to trots to
canters.
</P>
<P>
   The scenery changes quickly as well, weaving during one segment
through the wild Chic Choc Hills. For an hour the group tromps
happily through a balsam forest, then emerges onto a country road
before heading off into fields of hay, wheat, clover or barley.
Sometimes there are steep ravines or high hills.
</P>
<P>
   Loggers and farmers wave often, pausing to chat briefly with
Yves. And always, sometimes in the distance, sometimes just over a
hill, and sometimes right beside you, the St. Lawrence Seaway
glistens in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's demanding,'' said Rosemarie Dentino, a 60-year-old
grandmother from Peoria, Ill. ``But that's OK with me. I came to
ride. I don't want to do a lot of sitting around.''

 &HT;    Stay in step with rings, bracelets that add decorative touch to
ankles and toes
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 30.
 &HT;    By Amy Winn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   His friends say Marietta's (Ga.) Michael Cramer will do just
about anything to get a laugh (or meet girls). So they weren't
really surprised when, one day, the 25-year-old grad student at
Georgia Tech showed up at school with brightly painted toenails.
</P>
<P>
   His explanation: ``Last summer, a friend of mine was making fun
of a guy who had his toenails painted, so the next day, I showed up
at school with mine painted, too. It was just to spite my friend,
but I thought it looked cool, so I kept doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cramer finds his paint jobs are a ``great conversation starter.
If a woman sees my feet and says it's cool, then that's a whole
conversation right there: colors, techniques, why I do it. Not many
guys do it; it's different. Chicks dig it.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern summers demand sandals, and among Atlantans it has
become trendy to take a step beyond pedicures, wearing eye-catching
toe and ankle accessories as well.
</P>
<P>
   Like Cramer, Fayetteville's (Ga.) Darlene Carlton, 31, enjoys
showcasing her feet. She gets pedicures regularly, and in recent
months started wearing a gold toe ring. She prefers fitted rings
from Lenox Square's Totally Toes kiosk rather than ``clip-on''
adjustable ones.
</P>
<P>
   The labor and employee relations specialist for HUD says, ``(It)
wouldn't be cute on everybody, but it makes me feel sexy, like
everyone is looking at my feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Toe rings, bands and ankle bracelets are sold all over town, and
their prices and styles vary widely. At the three Totally Toes
locations, sterling silver rings sell for as little as $8, gold
bands as little as $20 and gem-studded styles can cost several
hundred.
</P>
<P>
   Worthmore Jewelers in Atlanta sells sterling silver adjustable
rings but has recently added a line of 14K gold-and-gemstone rings
called Toesies in the $180-$300 range. In addition to toe rings,
Catwalk, a shoe boutique, sells ``foot bracelets,'' which cover the
top of the foot and go around the ankle. They're made of various
materials, including beads, shells and leather in addition to
metals. Shelby's Foot Jewels, based in Laguna Beach, Calif.,
specializes in similar foot bracelets, cleverly named ``Shoewels.''
They also offer fitted toe rings in sterling silver and gold fill;
beaded and sterling silver ankle bracelets, thumb rings, and waist
chains. The company's Web site, www.shelbysfootjewels.com, lists
designs and colors, photos and sizing information.
</P>
<P>
   Decaturite (Ga.) Kacey Cloues, a tax incentives specialist for
the Historic Preservation Division of the Georgia Department of
Natural Resources, describes herself as usually low-maintenance,
but she has become a foot adornment acolyte. Cloues, 23, reasoned,
``Why not wear a ring on your toe if you can wear them on your
finger?''
</P>
<P>
   Cloues said she likes her ring because it stands out, but not
too much. ``It's subtle _ not as bold a statement as a tattoo or
piercing. It's appropriate for the office, yet different and
unique.'' And unlike tattoos or piercings, ``It wasn't painful!''
Cloues said with a laugh.

<P>
   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Surday in
September. Here's how our adventure went:
</P>
<P>
   The riders assemble
</P>
<P>
   On a cool evening a group of riders gathers at the Une Ferme en
Gaspesie (A Farm in Gaspesie), an inn just outside the tiny town of
Mont-Joli.
</P>
<P>
   We had driven up the western coast of the peninsula from Quebec
City, a gorgeous five-hour trip, arriving in time for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The eight riders assembled for the trip range from a 23-year-old
who has been riding half her life to a 60-year-old grandmother who
took up riding just four years ago. We are business owners, an
engineer, a teacher, a volunteer, a social worker and journalists.
Other than all being from the United States, we seem to have little
in common except for one, unifying thing _ a passion for horses.
</P>
<P>
   Our innkeeper, Pierre Dufort, is a jolly, fervent French
Canadian who is proud of his austere, spotless inn and the fine
food he serves. For dinner we have a choice of six entrees: lamb,
pheasant, rabbit, pork, beef or shrimp. Only the shrimp isn't from
Pierre's farm. It came from Matane, a fishing village 12 miles
away. The vegetables were picked fresh from the garden outside the
kitchen door.
</P>
<P>
   The desserts are rich. Among them is a local favorite, a large
slab of freshly baked white bread, covered in fruit, then liberally
sprinkled with grated maple sugar and drowned in cream.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before dinner is served, we meet our guides, the
Pruneaus, who will lead us for the next five days. The couple owns
Ranch Des Collines Chic Chocs in St.-Damase, Quebec. Yves has been
running horse trips in the area for seven years. His wife, Heather,
joined him four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The first night, the Pruneaus size us up, matching our abilities
with specific mounts. The horses are as diverse as our group,
ranging from a dainty Arabian mare almost small enough to qualify
as a pony to a large draft horse Yves sometimes uses to log in the
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Yves and Heather also welcome back Lenny and Chris Rankin, who
have returned for their second trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just love the people, the horses, the area, the culture,''
said Chris, who has two horses of her own back home in Burlington,
N.J. ``It's just a great experience from start to finish.''
</P>
<P>
   Day one: At a gallop
</P>
<P>
   Saddling up for the first day, we're on the trail by 9:30 after
a breakfast of crepes, waffles, bacon and sausage. We are scheduled
to roam through the Tartigou River Valley and along the Evergreen
Trail, a tunnel of conifers so dense it nearly blocks out the sun.
At one point, Yves orders the horses into a canter and they fly
along almost silently on the soft floor of pine needles.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, when the trail turns, I lose sight of my co-riders
and it seems I'm galloping alone, brushing past the trees, my hat
blown back, my hair flying from the strong strides of Ti Loup, my
Canadian-bred horse.
</P>
<P>
   Too soon, we round a curve and I see the now-familiar sign
coming down the line of riders: a fist, raised in the air and
pumping up and down. Ti Loup (French for ``Little Wolf''_ an irony
because he is a huge draft horse) sees the signal about the same
time I do and eases back into a bone-jarring trot.
</P>
<P>
   Yves keeps the tempo changing, rarely staying at a walk for more
than 15 minutes. Riders are expected to post during trots, a
movement that requires you to lift your weight off the saddle with
your legs with each stride of the horse. It can be tiring when you
aren't accustomed to doing it for long periods, so I am happy when
we turn into a farm for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   As we ride in, we pass large pastures full of skittish red deer,
who shy from our horses. We ride up to the back door of the
farmhouse, shuck off our boots and enter the homey kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Although the woman inside speaks only French, we show our
appreciation for her simple but hearty meal (freshly made bread,
sausage and vegetables in a scrambled-egg base and a super-sweet
cobbler) with smiles and a few quickly learned French terms.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, we ride through a massive maple forest.
Instead of buckets and taps, the modern maple forest has hoses
connecting the trees. Yves explains that the sap runs to a central
building where it is processed into syrup.
</P>
<P>
   As the sun begins to set, we ride along the edges of fields with
freshly bailed hay waiting to be stored for the approaching harsh
winter. In the distance we see the sparkling St. Lawrence Seaway, a
constant companion on this trip. We arrive at our evening
destination, Lac (Lake) Malcolm, the only hotel we visit during the
trip and the only accommodations with private bathrooms. Some of
the riders swim or boat in the lake, others nap before dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Day two: Blueberries, hills
</P>
<P>
   After treating the hotel owner's children to a quick ride, we
head out along back-country roads where local drivers are
considerate of the horses, slowing or even stopping to allow riders
to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Crossing into a balsam forest, we take trails and dirt roads to
the home of a blueberry farmer, where the owner has lunch waiting.
Dessert is a yummy blueberry cake.
</P>
<P>
   The afternoon takes us into the Chic Choc Hills, including some
rather steep climbs. But Yves decides against climbing the highest
of the hills, which is 1,350 feet above sea level, so we miss out
on the promised panoramic view that would allow us to see all the
way to the Atlantic Ocean. The weather is just too hot for the
horses.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, temperature is relative. For Canadians, where winters
are severe and below-zero temperatures common, 75 degrees is warm.
That's where the thermometer hovers this week, very high for early
September, and our guides apologize. But we find it perfect riding
weather, especially compared with the August heat wave we left
behind in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   As the afternoon winds down, Yves and Heather take us to a
hidden pool, complete with waterfall. Only Yves and two of the
riders are brave enough to dive in, but the rest of us enjoy
dipping our feet in the chilly water.
</P>
<P>
   During one of the climbs we're afforded a brilliant view of the
St. Lawrence, where boats and ships slip up from the Quebec area,
heading for the open sea.
</P>
<P>
   Our stop for the evening is Le Jardin de Givre (The Garden of
Frost), owned by Ginette and Gerald Couture. Yves helped build the
inn, which is beautifully decorated with polished wood furniture,
local artwork and dozens of pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Ginette prepares lush breakfasts that include French toast, four
homemade jams and soft-boiled eggs. Dinners are three-course
gourmet affairs that include cream of tomato soup, stuffed squash,
lentil pilaf and braised beef. Vegetables are picked an hour or two
before each meal, and each plate is decorated with edible flowers
from the garden. After dinner, Ginette entertains guests with her
lovely singing and piano playing.
</P>
<P>
   Later, we step outside and discover the Milky Way looking like a
streak of cotton streaming across the sky with tiny Christmas
lights twinkling within.
</P>
<P>
   Day three: Logging miles
</P>
<P>
   We will be staying at Le Jardin de Givre again tonight, so Yves
pulls out detailed maps to show us today's route.
</P>
<P>
   We return to the Chic Choc Hills, often taking logging roads. On
many of the dirt roads, felled trees are stacked, sometimes more
than 10 feet high, waiting to be dragged away.
</P>
<P>
   We pass a logger hauling downed trees to the roadside, and Yves
stops to chat. He has permission to cross many owners' land because
his tours bring much-needed money into the area.
</P>
<P>
   Yves identifies plants and trees for the riders. But with 10
horses clumping along, we see little wildlife, except for a covey
of grouse we scare up this morning on another dirt logging road.
</P>
<P>
   Lunch is at a trout farm, where several riders volunteer to
catch tonight's dinner. In the ponds _ just small holes where we
can see hundreds of fish swimming n out the perfectly cooked whole
fish, and Yves gives us a quick lesson in how to easily debone a
trout.
</P>
<P>
   Day four: Country roads
</P>
<P>
   Today's ride covers all types of terrain, from forests to farms
to country roads. We cross the South White River, allowing the
horses to drink from the cool, fast-running water.
</P>
<P>
   Lunch is pulled from our saddlebags and enjoyed by a lovely
lake. The rides are a bit longer each day, and even Heather admits
to being sore by Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   This is the only day we don't ride to our inn. We leave the
horses at a barn outside of Padoug and are driven into town, where
we stay at La Villa de Vieux Clocher, an old church rectory that
has been restored into a stunning bed-and-breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner is a traditional fondue, and Yves jokes that anyone who
drops anything into the hot oil must help clean the horses in the
morning. Actually, riders can do as much or as little as they want
on the ride. If you want to feed, brush and saddle your horse
daily, you may, or you can let the Pruneaus do it all.
</P>
<P>
   Day five: Tired, satisfied
</P>
<P>
   We ride through rolling meadows and scrubby pine forests on our
way to an organic farm in Baie Des Sables (Sandy Bay), where owner
Lise Beaulieu has lunch waiting. After serving us quiche, salad,
homemade bread and pie, Lise takes us on a tour of her farm.
</P>
<P>
   That afternoon the ride goes into the small town of Les Boules
before turning to the St. Lawrence shoreline, where we walk the
horses for four miles while searching the water for seals, eider
ducks and cormorants bouncing with the ocean waves.
</P>
<P>
   The walk along the shore culminates in the 1 1/4-mile ``Bonzi
Canter.'' Yves says the ride is named for a pine that once stood at
the end of the run that looked like a bonsai tree.
</P>
<P>
   When Yves gives the signal, the pack begins running. Hats blow
back, hair flies up and the horses seem to enjoy the run as much as
the riders.

   ``That was incredible,'' said Kathy Mohs, a 55-year-old teacher
from Irvine, Calif. ``You never get to just run like that. What a
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Then we ride several more hours, winding our way back to Une
Ferme en Gaspesie and our original innkeeper, Pierre.
</P>
<P>
   We are a tired group, but we are also happy. We have made new
friends and have become better equestrians.
</P>
<P>
   After dinner, Pierre pours a special local drink and offers a
toast to the ride, our guides and our success.
</P>
<P>
   We raise our glasses to toast Yves and Heather and knock back a
shooter of rum and maple syrup, shouting, ``Tzigidou.''
</P>
<P>
   Loose translation?

<P>
   ``Everything's all right.''

 &HT;    Stay in step with rings, bracelets that add decorative touch to
ankles and toes
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 30.

   His friends say Marietta's (Ga.) Michael Cramer will do just
about anything to get a laugh (or meet girls). So they weren't
really surprised when, one day, the 25-year-old grad student at
Georgia Tech showed up at school with brightly painted toenails.
</P>
<P>
   His explanation: ``Last summer, a friend of mine was making fun
of a guy who had his toenails painted, so the next day, I showed up
at school with mine painted, too. It was just to spite my friend,
but I thought it looked cool, so I kept doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cramer finds his paint jobs are a ``great conversation starter.
If a woman sees my feet and says it's cool, then that's a whole
conversation right there: colors, techniques, why I do it. Not many
guys do it; it's different. Chicks dig it.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern summers demand sandals, and among Atlantans it has
become trendy to take a step beyond pedicures, wearing eye-catching
toe and ankle accessories as well.
</P>
<P>
   Like Cramer, Fayetteville's (Ga.) Darlene Carlton, 31, enjoys
showcasing her feet. She gets pedicures regularly, and in recent
months started wearing a gold toe ring. She prefers fitted rings
from Lenox Square's Totally Toes kiosk rather than ``clip-on''
adjustable ones.
</P>
<P>
   The labor and employee relations specialist for HUD says, ``(It)
wouldn't be cute on everybody, but it makes me feel sexy, like
everyone is looking at my feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Toe rings, bands and ankle bracelets are sold all over town, and
their prices and styles vary widely. At the three Totally Toes
locations, sterling silver rings sell for as little as $8, gold
bands as little as $20 and gem-studded styles can cost several
hundred.
</P>
<P>
   Worthmore Jewelers in Atlanta sells sterling silver adjustable
rings but has recently added a line of 14K gold-and-gemstone rings
called Toesies in the $180-$300 range. In addition to toe rings,
Catwalk, a shoe boutique, sells ``foot bracelets,'' which cover the
top of the foot and go around the ankle. They're made of various
materials, including beads, shells and leather in addition to
metals. Shelby's Foot Jewels, based in Laguna Beach, Calif.,
specializes in similar foot bracelets, cleverly named ``Shoewels.''
They also offer fitted toe rings in sterling silver and gold fill;
beaded and sterling silver ankle bracelets, thumb rings, and waist
chains. The company's Web site, www.shelbysfootjewels.com, lists
designs and colors, photos and sizing information.
</P>
<P>
   Decaturite (Ga.) Kacey Cloues, a tax incentives specialist for
the Historic Preservation Division of the Georgia Department of
Natural Resources, describes herself as usually low-maintenance,
but she has become a foot adornment acolyte. Cloues, 23, reasoned,
``Why not wear a ring on your toe if you can wear them on your
finger?''
</P>
<P>
   Cloues said she likes her ring because it stands out, but not
too much. ``It's subtle _ not as bold a statement as a tattoo or
piercing. It's appropriate for the office, yet different and
unique.'' And unlike tattoos or piercings, ``It wasn't painful!''
Cloues said with a laugh.

 &HT;    DEBRIS FROM BLOWN CONCORDE TIRES MAY HAVE LED TO CRASH, FRENCH
OFFICIALS SAY
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GONESSE, France _ A blown tire that apparently threw off debris
as the doomed Air France Concorde took off Tuesday may have set off
a chain of events that led to the supersonic aircraft's fiery crash
that killed 114 people, the French government said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the fire that began before the Concorde became airborne
probably began outside the engines, suggesting that tire debris may
have punctured fuel lines or tanks in the wings, investigators
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the information available at present to this body, it
emerges that at least one tire burst, something that could have
triggered a chain of events, damage to the plane's structure, a
fire and engine failure,'' French Transport Minister Jean-Claude
Gayssot said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Gayssot ordered the nation's aviation authorities to develop
safety measures that would allow Air France to resume its Concorde
flights. The airline said Friday that the flights were suspended
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Concorde tires have blown out on takeoff before. U.S. safety
inspectors warned French counterparts in a November 1981 report to
change Air France Concorde procedures after four ``potentially
catastrophic'' cases of blown tires on takeoff from New York and
Washington area airports in a 20-month period.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious incident occurred on June 14, 1979 when two
tires on an Air France Concorde blew out at Washington's Dulles
Airport casting off metal and rubber fragments that punctured wing
fuel tanks and damaged an engine.
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board
recommended modifications to the landing gear, which were made. The
NTSB released copies of its 19-year-old recommendations Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Passenger Bill Lightfoot, then an aviation consultant headed for
the Paris Air Show, recalled Friday having seen something zip by
his window _ vertically _ as the wheels left the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see a hole in the wing _ a big, jagged hole in the
wing, with liquid gushing'' that turned out to be fuel, said
Lightfoot, now a vice president of a major U.S. defense contractor.
Only after he threatened to storm the cockpit did the flight
attendants send back the co-pilot to look.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says 'Mon Dieu' and the guy just turned white,'' Lightfoot
recounted in a telephone interview with the Reuters News Agency.
Before the crew realized what had happened and turned the flight
around, the aircraft had been Paris-bound over the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Air France on Friday refused to speculate as to the whether a
burst tire could have triggered Tuesday's fatal crash.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, French investigators found the body of another
victim in the hotel destroyed when the Concorde crashed into it.
This raises the death toll to 114. That number includes the four
other people died on the ground, and all 109 passengers and
crewmembers aboard Air France Flight 4590.
</P>
<P>
   The French Bureau of Accident Investigations, or the BEA, said
in a statement Friday that at least one of the Concorde's four
tires on the left wing burst on takeoff before it crashed. The BEA
also said the flames seen on the left side of the aircraft during
takeoff appeared to have started outside the engines.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the present time, no debris from inside the engine has been
identified,'' the BEA said. ``The fire appears to have started
outside the engines, but this remains to be determined.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Amar, an aviation advisor to the French government, told
CNN that debris from the tire could have led to the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``This probably made some holes in the structures, and it's
possible that some fuel came from the aircraft on the back of the
aircraft,'' Amar said. ``On the engines, this could have made a
very big fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Former pilot and aviation expert Germain Chambost said on French
television that the Concorde's engines could have been damaged
after ingesting the tire debris. ``At full takeoff speed, a tire
that penetrates at that moment in the engine could cause very
serious damage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The BEA said Thursday that one of the two left-side engines
faltered twice during takeoff, while the other failed in the blaze
that streamed fire 200 feet behind the Concorde during its
two-minute flight.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said the plane could not even retract its landing
gear, and left behind a trail of debris on the runway, including
tire parts.
</P>
<P>
   At the crash-scene here in Gonesse, an industrial suburb north
of Paris, investigators began to chart the charred wreckage, hoping
to find thousands of parts to be taken to a French Air Force base
for storage.
</P>
<P>
   The families of the victims began the heart-breaking task of
providing forensic specialists with personal information about
their loved ones, such as the clothes or jewelry that they were
wearing, so bodies can be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Air France chairman Jean-Cyril Spinetta met Friday with families
of mainly German victims to tell them about the progress of the
crash investigation. He also led a remembrance service held at the
company's head-office at Charles de Gaulle International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Spinetta spoke of ``the same emotion, the same compassion, the
same infinite sadness'' uniting company staff, ``touching us _ both
flyers and the personnel on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The first names of each of the dead were read individually like
a solemn dirge: ``Jean, Marie . . . '' The service was punctuated
periodically by the roar of jets on a nearby runway.
</P>
<P>
   As the mourners in their navy blue Air France uniforms left the
service, their grief was visible. Many women sobbed and one woman
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   In Gonesse, nearly 1,500 residents, many carrying flowers,
staged a procession from the town hall to the crash site in
remembrance of the crash victims.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the marchers were Gonesse Mayor Jean-Pierre Blazy and
Michele Fricheteau, the hotel manager who survived the crash. She
and other hotel employees, many with tears in their eyes, were the
first to lay flowers near a fence erected by police at the crash
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to pay homage to the people who are dead, those who
worked for me,'' said Fricheteau, whose face and hands were in
bandages.

 &HT;    RUSSIA'S PUTIN DECLARES ERA OF 'OLIGARCHS' OVER
 &HT;    (700&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    With list of oligarchs attached at end of story.
 &HT;    By MARGARET COKER 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to a truce
Friday with the country's top tycoons, promising to spare them
government investigation into their alleged wrongdoing, but warning
that the era of their excessive political and financial influence
had come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   In a closed-door Kremlin meeting with 21 so-called
``oligarchs,'' Putin promised not to overturn the privatization
deals from the mid-1990s that made them fabulously wealthy at the
expense of the country as a whole. At the same time, he told them
that they were responsible to help lift Russia's economic doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   However, analysts said the meeting was aimed at overhauling the
oligarch's pecking order _ not reforming the system that has
crippled Russia's investment climate and caused rampant poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (the oligarch meeting) was a play produced for public
consumption, not necessarily a reflection of reality. Many
questions remain (like whether) the show was just a cover for
installing new, more Putin-friendly, oligarchs, and whether the
business climate will actually improve because of this,'' said
Peter Ekman, a Moscow-based financial commentator.
</P>
<P>
   During Russia's 1996 presidential elections, the oligarchs
emerged as political and financial heavyweights when they agreed to
throw their wealth and media resources behind then-President Boris
Yeltsin in his battle against a strong Communist challenger.
</P>
<P>
   After Yeltsin's re-election, these tycoons grew even richer from
their access to the Kremlin, which allowed them to participate in
and win lucrative privatization deals and circumvent national laws
and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian public hates these businessmen for the way they
acquired their wealth while the country was collapsing,'' said
Yevgeny Volk, the head of the Heritage Foundation in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Putin had invited a select group of these business leaders to
the Kremlin Friday after a spate of unprecedented attacks by his
government on many of the oligarchs' businesses. For example,
federal officials arrested _ and temporarily jailed _ media mogul
Vladimir Gusinsky, after raiding the offices of several of his
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who was elected in March, pledged to make all equal
before the government and the law, and the ensuing police actions
have been interpreted by some as the government's effort to show
the tycoons their place.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of the Friday meeting, the businessmen expected a
kiss-and-make-up session. Putin appeared to concede on their main
concern, that the government would revise privatization results and
leave them penniless.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president said again that the government would not review
the results of privatization. At the same time he made clear that
from now on, government structures would not aid businesses in
their work or battles,'' government spokeswoman Natalya Timakova
said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, as customary, did not make a public statement, preferring
to work through his press service.
</P>
<P>
   For all of Putin's sharp words, businessmen left the Kremlin in
smiles. Mikhail Khordokovsky, who owns Russia's third-largest oil
company, told reporters that many issues had been cleared up during
the two-hour, 40-minute meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have hints on how we have to deal with the government
in the future. We were told what the rules of the game are (under
Putin,)'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Potanin, who controls Russia's largest
telecommunications company and has been accused of tax evasion,
told reporters that the era of oligarchs ``was over.''
</P>
<P>
   However, other evidence exists that indeed it is not.
</P>
<P>
   While the Kremlin has opened tax evasion cases against many
leading businessmen in recent weeks, many notable tycoons have
escaped official scrutiny. In fact, men like Roman Abramovich and
Oleg Derikpasa have seen their empires grow under the Putin regime
under questionable circumstances similar to the Yeltsin-era
privatization deals.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that Putin's words would soon be put to the test,
when the results of the latest government sale of a state-owned oil
company is announced Sept. 18. Rumors are already flying that
Abramovich has fixed the privatization deal, and will win the
tender without competition.

   Boris Berezovsky
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The man credited with building the oligarchs as a political
force, through his organization of former President Boris Yeltsin's
1996 re-election campaign. He has a controlling share of Russia's
only national TV station, owns major national newspapers and is the

</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Potanin
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  He is the owner of Norilsk Nickel, the world's largest
producer of platinum and palladium, and a major shareholder in

</P>
<P>
   prices. His bank, Uneximbank, went bankrupt in the financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Anatoly Chubais
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A former prime minister of the Yeltsin administration. He is
the man who created the country's privatization program, which is

   With the Republican National Convention beckoning next week in
Philadelphia, George W. Bush has his first real chance to convince
American voters that he is ``ready'' to lead the country. For the
past four months, the supposedly lightweight Bush has dominated the
presidential campaign. He is currently slightly ahead in the polls,
and unless something terrible happens at what promises to be a
heavily overscripted convention, he can expect to increase his lead
still. But no matter how endearing Bush seems at the podium next
Thursday night, his appeal will not truly be tested until his
televised contests with Al Gore in October. &QL;

   Locked in a comfortless marriage, Israelis and Palestinians can
manage neither reconciliation nor divorce. The collapse of the
15-day marathon at Camp David showed that even the most zealous
marriage-guidance counselor couldn't do the trick. If Bill Clinton
was not able _ in pressure-cooker conditions _ to get Ehud Barak
and Yasser Arafat to compromise their positions, it probably means
that those positions, at least in the short term, are
irreconcilable. Yet history dictates that there can be no divorce. &QL;

the House of Representatives may pass every one of the 13 bills

July. The Senate is only a bit behind that crackling pace. &QL;

   With the Republican National Convention beckoning next week in
Philadelphia, George W. Bush has his first real chance to convince
American voters that he is ``ready'' to lead the country. For the
past four months, the supposedly lightweight Bush has dominated the
presidential campaign. He is currently slightly ahead in the polls,
and unless something terrible happens at what promises to be a
heavily overscripted convention, he can expect to increase his lead
still. But no matter how endearing Bush seems at the podium next
Thursday night, his appeal will not truly be tested until his
televised contests with Al Gore in October. &QL;

   Locked in a comfortless marriage, Israelis and Palestinians can
manage neither reconciliation nor divorce. The collapse of the
15-day marathon at Camp David showed that even the most zealous
marriage-guidance counselor couldn't do the trick. If Bill Clinton
was not able _ in pressure-cooker conditions _ to get Ehud Barak
and Yasser Arafat to compromise their positions, it probably means
that those positions, at least in the short term, are
irreconcilable. Yet history dictates that there can be no divorce. &QL;

every summer to tackle some of its worst troubles: poverty,
disease, warfare, crime and pollution, to name but a few. Then, a
year later, they face the occupational hazard of humbler
soothsayers everywhere: how to explain to their followers why
nothing much has changed. At this year's summit in Okinawa, July
21-23, they found an answer: say it all again with feeling, plus
Internet initiatives _ but respect tradition as well. &QL;

Party away from those ghastly people in Congress. Evidentally, Bush
has now had second thoughts. His choice, Dick Cheney, is a
rock-solid candidate, with all the charisma of that inorganic
substance. He fulfills the Hippocratic requirements of a vice
president (``First, do no harm''). He will not contradict,

STUDY FINDS LOSING A LICENSE DOESN'T KEEP DRIVERS OFF THE ROAD
</HEADLINE>
  By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON &UR; _  &LR; Revoking or suspending a driver's license is one
of the most severe punishments for moving violations. But the
police and some safety advocates suspect that often it is no
punishment at all, and no protection for other people on the road,
because in many cases it does not stop the violator from driving.
</P>
<P>
   A new study agrees, finding that one in five fatal accidents
involves at least one driver without a valid license.
</P>
<P>
   In a study sponsored by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety,
researchers analyzed 184,000 fatal crashes over five years,
involving more than 206,000 deaths. Nearly 37,000 of the crashes
involved a driver who did not appear to be properly licensed. Of
the 278,000 drivers involved in the crashes, regardless of who was
at fault, 13.8 percent had an invalid license; of those, 54 percent
had licenses that had been revoked or suspended. Others had never
been licensed, or had been denied licenses.
</P>
<P>
   The finding impressed the president of the AAA foundation, David
K. Willis. The roughly 42,000 who died in crashes involving an
improperly licensed driver was the equivalent of dozens of ``Boeing
737's falling out of the sky each year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, he said, his foundation issues reports and makes
recommendations, but in this case it had none. ``I wish I knew the
answer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many fatal crashes are single-car wrecks, and the unlicensed
driver is the only driver involved, but often there are passengers
or drivers of other vehicles. And sometimes, according to the
survey data, there were even collisions involving two or three cars
that were all driven by people who were not licensed.
</P>
<P>
   By focusing on a single point with reliable data _ fatal crashes
_ the study underscored how little is known about everyday driving.
</P>
<P>
   The authors, Lindsay I. Griffin III and Sandra DeLaZerda, both
with the Texas Transportation Institute at Texas A &AMP; M University,
cited a 1994 study that predicted that 30 percent to 70 percent of
drivers whose licenses were suspended or revoked might continue to
drive. That study showed a sharp regional divergence _ the problem
was far worse in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Those driving with an invalid license, no license, or ``unknown
license status'' at the time of a fatal crash made up more than 20
percent of total fatalities in Alaska, Hawaii, California, Arizona,
the District of Columbia and New Mexico. The number was less than
10 percent in Maine, New Hampshire, Minnesota, Kentucky,
Massachusetts, Nebraska, Ohio, Maryland and Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a big demographic difference. Men, who are nearly
3 times as likely as women to be drivers in fatal crashes, were
more than 6 times as likely to be driving with a suspended license
and almost 10 times as likely to be driving with a revoked license.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with all drivers, those without proper licenses were
also likely to be young.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that the unlicensed drivers were far more
likely to have had one or more suspensions for driving under the
influence of alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers Against Drunk Driving and other safety advocates have
been successful in persuading some states to invoke
``administrative license revocation,'' or ALR, a process under
which a person stopped for driving under the influence loses his or
her license promptly, with court proceedings later. But Karolyn
Nunnallee, the immediate past president of MADD, said that while
the procedure was sound, ``we don't want ALR to be a stand-alone
law.'' She added, ``We want fines assessed, community service hours
ordered and jail time for second-time offenders.''
</P>
<P>
   In a surprising twist, Nunnallee and others agree that people
who drive with suspended or revoked licenses tend to speed less,
run fewer red lights and commit fewer other infractions, for fear
of drawing attention to themselves. ``They oddly continue to drive
a little safer than they did before,'' she said. They also drive
fewer miles, some experts believe.
</P>
<P>
   But making sure they stop driving altogether is much harder.
California has experimented with ``arresting'' the vehicle when
someone's license is revoked or suspended, and holding it for 30
days; North Carolina and some other states will confiscate and
auction off a vehicle for certain driving offenses. Neither tactic
is foolproof, though.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin, the study's co-author, said the long-term solution
might be technological, a license that is a ``smart card,'' like an
automated-teller card or a key card, that would be required to
start the engine. But even this would not be perfect, he said,
because someone without a valid license could steal one, or borrow
one from someone else.  &QL;

   ORKIN _ Internal memos written by Orkin Exterminating officials
acknowledge that company employees in several states, including
Georgia, falsified forms for reinspections of homes for termite
damage. The memos, obtained by the Journal-Constitution, say that
many customers ''are being charged for services not rendered.''
Orkin and its parent company, Atlanta-based Rollins Inc., are
targets of a Tampa lawsuit that alleges that Orkin workers
performed improper chemical treatments, skipped annual inspections,
forged customer names on inspection slips, and misrepresented
warranties, leading to widespread termite damage. Orkin faces a
similar lawsuit in Alabama that has reached class-action status.
The company denies the charges in each case. In addition, the
Florida attorney general's office is investigating Orkin's
advertising and warranty practices. Bob Buchner, a Florida
assistant attorney general, says five other states _ not Georgia _
are also investigating Orkin. (Miller, Atlanta

   ORKIN _ Internal memos written by Orkin Exterminating officials
acknowledge that company employees in several states, including
Georgia, falsified forms for reinspections of homes for termite
damage. The memos, obtained by the Journal-Constitution, say that
many customers ''are being charged for services not rendered.''
Orkin and its parent company, Atlanta-based Rollins Inc., are
targets of a Tampa lawsuit that alleges that Orkin workers
performed improper chemical treatments, skipped annual inspections,
forged customer names on inspection slips, and misrepresented
warranties, leading to widespread termite damage. Orkin faces a
similar lawsuit in Alabama that has reached class-action status.
The company denies the charges in each case. In addition, the
Florida attorney general's office is investigating Orkin's
advertising and warranty practices. Bob Buchner, a Florida
assistant attorney general, says five other states _ not Georgia _
are also investigating Orkin. (Miller, Atlanta

 &HT;    DEM TICKET: WHERE ARE ALL THE WOMEN?
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In June, just as the Democratic presidential
primaries were nearing an anticlimactic end, the Clinton-Gore
administration boasted of its successes in advancing the political
standing of women since the United Nations conference on women's
rights in Beijing five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But thus far in his very private process of selecting a running
mate, Vice President Al Gore has given few hints that he is ready
to advance the political standing of women by selecting one for the
No. 2 spot on the Democratic presidential ticket this year.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, as he began to narrow the number of vice
presidential candidates, Gore suggested that his long list of
potential running mates included women, though he was not specific.
``I think it's only fair to the men and women involved to keep it
private and dignified,'' he said of his selection process.
</P>
<P>
   But hardly any of the news accounts of Gore's selection process
speculated on the possibility of the vice president selecting a
woman. Most of the speculation centered on Sens. John Kerry of
Massachusetts, Bob Graham of Florida, Evan Bayh of Indiana and Tom
Harkin of Iowa, House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri and
former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   But what about a woman? Is it possible that Gore is haunted by
the ghost of 1984, when former Vice President Walter Mondale picked
a little known New York congresswoman, Geraldine Ferraro, and went
on to the greatest defeat in modern American politics?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that has anything to do with it,'' said Marla
Romash, a longtime political associate of Gore's. ``It's more about
numbers than anything else. They're just aren't that many women to
choose from.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the ranks of Democratic women politicians are so thin
that noted Democratic pollster Celinda Lake has reached into the
ranks of lieutenant governors for a possible Gore running mate.
Admittedly, Lake's candidate is no average lieutenant governor:
Kathleen Kennedy Townsend of Maryland, daughter of the late Robert
F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   But the vice presidential selection process of both Gore and
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the soon-to-be Republican presidential
nominee, has generally rankled people who had hoped to see more of
a female presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just shows once again that women have an uphill battle in
politics as in any other field dominated by white males,'' said
Mary Hawkesworth, director of the Center for American Women and
Politics, which is located at Rutgers University in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   It is the same for women worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing
in 1995 declared that ``women's empowerment and their full
participation on the basis of equality in all spheres of society,
including participation in the decision-making process and access
to power, are fundamental for the achievement of equality,
development and peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House, in its five-year review of its commitment to
the conference goals, said in June that the Clinton-Gore
administration had ``worked diligently to improve and advance the
status'' of women.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to a ``gender balanced'' presidential ticket,
``the political parties like to talk about viability _ or lack of
it,'' added Hawkesworth. ``But the fact is, there are plenty of
women who would be viable candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Red Cross Director Elizabeth Dole, who served in the last
two Republican cabinets, was widely touted as a possible running
mate for Bush. But Bush chose oil industry executive Dick Cheney, a
former congressman and Bush cabinet member.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore coasted to victory in the Democratic presidential
primaries this spring, generating a guessing game about possible
running mates, Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California was frequently
mentioned. A seasoned politician and one of the best speakers in
American politics today, Feinstein has a generally _ but not
uniformly _ liberal voting record.
</P>
<P>
   But Feinstein is up for re-election this year. And she is from a
state that Gore could win this fall without her help. In addition,
she voted against NAFTA, one of the administration's major
accomplishments, and was among the first Democrats to condemn
President Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore's biggest problem (in selecting a female running mate) is
the size of the pool,'' said Jack Pitney, a political science
professor at Clarement-McKenna College in California.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic women account for just six senators, 39 House members
and one governor, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire. Like Feinstein
in the senate, 37 of the 39 House members are up for reelection _
two are leaving the House. Shaheen also is seeking another term.
</P>
<P>
   The six Democratic senators average 19.8 years each in politics,
topped by Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, 27 years, Feinstein, 26
years, and Barbara Boxer of California, 24 years. The six men most
mentioned as possible Gore running mates average 22.3 years each in
politics, with Graham at top, 34 years, and Gephardt, 29 years.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio and Louise Slaughter of New York are
the Democratic women who have served the most consecutive years in
the House _ Kaptur, 18, and Slaughter, 14. But neither has been
mentioned as a possible Gore running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Neither have Clinton cabinet members Donna Shalala, Alexis
Herman or Janet Reno. (Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is
barred by the U.S. Constitution from running because she was not
born in the United States.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore's choice has to be perceived by most voters as
presidential,'' said Joel Goldstein, author of ``The Modern
American Vice Presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Romash: ``You don't get on the list in a vacuum. You get
on the list by having years of experience in public service. And
we're still working to increase the number of women available to be
on the list.''

<P>
   The final leg of George W. Bush's road to the Republican
presidential nomination began in Texas today and moved into
President Clinton's home state as his campaign embarked on a
strategically designed tour of six swing states that will climax
with his arrival at the convention in Philadelphia on Wednesday. At
a high school in Springdale, Ark., Bush praised the integrity of
running mate Dick Cheney and took a jab at Clinton's scandal-filled
White House years. En route to Philadelphia, Bush also plans stops
at an athletic center in Missouri, a baseball bat museum in
Kentucky, a park in Ohio, a war memorial in West Virginia and the
state capitol in Pennsylvania, among other places.
</P>
<P>
   PRE-CONVENTION BOUNCE
</P>
<P>
   Candidates often get a boost during their convention _ and even
before it starts. It happened again: George W. Bush and Dick Cheney
have opened an 11-point lead over Al Gore in a new CNN-USA
Today-Gallup poll. It showed Bush ahead of Gore 50-39 percent, with
Green Party candidate Ralph Nader at 4 percent and Reform Party
contender Pat Buchanan at 1 percent. Gore had closed the gap with
Bush just a week ago in the same poll. The poll has a 4 percentage
point margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   PERCEPTIONS ON STRONG POINTS
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, the CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll also showed, has
done a better job than Al Gore of convincing voters that he is
personally suited to be president. The poll gave Bush an advantage
on several issues including world affairs, taxes, the budget
surplus and the economy. Gore had an edge on health care and the
environment. They were about even on Social Security and education.
</P>
<P>
   MOST FOUND TO BE TUNING IT OUT
</P>
<P>
   Another survey is showing that Americans are largely ignoring
the presidential campaign, and that their impressions of the
candidates do not show a strong correlation with the media's
election coverage. A joint study and poll by the Pew Research
Center for the People &AMP; the Press and the Project for Excellence in
Journalism found, for example, that only about 26 percent of
Americans view Al Gore as tainted by past scandal, even though
nearly half of the stories about him that have run since February
have dealt with White House fund-raising abuses. In the same
period, more than half of the stories about George W. Bush focused
on ``different kind of Republican'' theme, but only 20 percent said
he had different views from traditional GOP leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ALL DEPENDS ON WHO YOU TALK TO
</P>
<P>
   There's both good and bad for both candidates in the results of
the poll by the Pew Research Center. Al Gore is
``scandal-tainted,'' according to about one-quarter of the
registered voters in a new poll. But almost four in 10 identify
Gore as competent and knowledgeable. George W. Bush has relied on
family connections to get ahead, more than half say. Gore is a
candidate who will say what's popular rather than what he believes,
one-third say. One in five sees Bush as a candidate who is not
serious or lacks intelligence, as the Democrats have been saying.
Also, one in five believes Bush is ``a different kind of
Republican,'' as he has been proclaiming.
</P>
<P>
   SHOW BIZ WITH THE POLITICS
</P>
<P>
   Republican convention officials released details today of the
second half of the four-day event, next Wednesday and Thursday. The
lineup, according to convention chief Andrew Card, reflects Bush's
aim of ``bringing more people into the party who might not
otherwise be there.'' Celebrities who'll be playing a part : pro
``wrassler'' The Rock, footballer Steve Young, soul singer Chaka
Khan, country duo Brooks &AMP; Dunn, vocal groups Harold Melvin's Blue
Notes and the Delfonics, actress Bo Derek, former Miss America
Heather Whitestone McCallum. Oh, there'll also be regular folks to
discuss issues, like a Hispanic small businessman, a farmer and a
single parent.
</P>
<P>
   GOP PRIMARY OVERHAUL DEBATED
</P>
<P>
   The George W. Bush campaign was marshaling forces today to try
and defeat a plan to stretch the presidential primary calendar by
voting in four waves from February through May and letting small
states go first. The ``Delaware plan'' is under consideration by
the GOP convention's rules committee. Bush strategist Karl Rove
said he worries that an elongated primary schedule would add ``wear
and tear'' on the next GOP candidate by increasing the travel
schedule. He also said it would put the GOP at a competitive
disadvantage because the Democrats would wrap up their 2004
nominations process much earlier than the Republicans. Said ex-Sen.
Bill Brock of Tennessee, who helped formulate the Delaware plan:
``I think they're wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   PLATFORM EASIER ON THE RHETORIC
</P>
<P>
   Spelling out the credo of ``compassionate conservatism,'' the
Republicans' draft platform is a manifesto of George W. Bush's
campaign and moderates the GOP's official stance on issues from
education to immigration. While maintaining the staunch
anti-abortion language of the party's most recent platforms, the
draft document strips away some of the harsher anti-government
rhetoric. The document even calls for some increases in federal
spending and regulation in areas such as education and the
environment. ``Government does have a role to play, but as a
partner, not a rival, to the armies of compassion,'' the platform
draft states.
</P>
<P>
   ALL POLITICS IS POLITICAL
</P>
<P>
   A panel of the GOP platform committee voted 10-3 today against
an attempt to strike abortion language from the document, and 11-3
against an amendment expressing ``recognition and respect'' for
both sides on the issue. Toni Casey of Los Altos Hills, Calif., one
of the three, summoned the party to take abortion out of politics
and ``come together.'' But Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois countered
that abortion is necessarily political, at least because some
abortions are taxpayer-financed. ``It's right up to its neck in
politics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   GORE AT THE BEACH
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has carved out time for mulling over running mates and
polishing his big speech, but he said babysitting, swimming and
reading are really at the top of his seaside priorities. Gore
arrived for a week of sun and relaxation on a posh island off the
North Carolina coast, staying at a friend's house in a gated
community of upscale homes in Wrightsville Beach. Gore gave
reporters some advice for the coming week: ``You can call your
editors and tell them he is not doing anything.'' However, he
quickly conceded that wasn't strictly the case.
</P>
<P>
   BUT SURELY, IT HAS TO BE A FACTOR
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore intends to select a running mate who is ready to serve
``from day one,'' campaign spokesman Chris Lehane said, despite
prodding to avoid a pick that would erode the party's chances of
recapturing the Senate. The polite brushoff came after Senate
Minority Leader Tom Daschle said he hoped Gore would consider the
impact of his choice on the congressional elections. Sens. John
Kerry of Massachusetts, Bob Graham of Florida, Richard Durbin of
Illinois and Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut are all from states
with Republican governors, and the governor would be able to
appoint a Senate successor.
</P>
<P>
   GROWING BLACK GOP PRESENCE
</P>
<P>
   There are 85 black delegates attending the Republican
convention, a 63 percent increase over the 1996 count. Prominent
black Republicans participating include retired Gen. Colin Powell
and Condoleezza Rice, George W. Bush's national security adviser.
Surveys by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies show
that only only 8.3 percent of black voters identify with the GOP,
but that 31.6 percent of younger African-Americans identified
themselves as conservatives, which may bode well in the future for
Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   FROM TEXAS, IT'S THE `TRUTH SQUAD'
</P>
<P>
   Democrats deployed a team of angry Texans to ``speak the truth''
about George W. Bush's record, launching a four-day bus tour
through key battleground states to tell voters what life is like in
Texas, at least from a Democratic perspective. Calling themselves
the ``Texas Truth Squad,'' the two dozen residents spoke of
pollution, education and health care at several brief stops through
Kentucky. ``I'm here to tell you, the Bushes are coming!'' bellowed
Harry Fred Scott of East Texas. ``You've got to beware!''
</P>
<P>
   RAH-RAH, LET'S HEAR IT FOR THE TEAM
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have a chance to take control of the White House and
Congress for the first time in a half century, and GOP chairman Jim
Nicholson says that has infused the party with a new burst of
enthusiasm. He encouraged Republican National Committee members to
``just imagine next January 20,'' when Republicans are sworn in as
president and vice president ``in front of a Republican speaker of
the House and a Republican Senate majority leader, all watched by
at least 30 Republican governors.'' This will happen while ``Al
Gore and Tipper, Bill Clinton and Hillary look on from the cheap
seats,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A GOOD WAY TO GO OUT
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney put in just under five years as chairman and CEO at
oil services giant Halliburton, but could be eligible for a
retirement package worth at least $2.1 million, financial records
show. He also has company stock options worth millions. Cheney has
said that in leaving the company, which paid him $1.3 million last
year, he will ``take a bath'' financially and planned to ``get rid
of anything that might constitute a conflict of interest'' if he
and Bush are elected. Vice presidents earn $181,400 a year.
According to company financial reports, Cheney is entitled to $2.1
million in deferred compensation, and the money earns above-market
interest of at least 10 percent annually,
</P>
<P>
   PUT THE WIFE TO WORK, TOO?
</P>
<P>
   Even as Dick Cheney was put on the Republican ticket this week,
there already was a buzz around town that George W. Bush, if
elected, will make Cheney his education secretary _ Lynne Cheney,
that is. The 59-year-old V.P. candidate's wife, who will be highly
visible at the Republican convention next week, has a sterling
resume, a loyal constituency and a fiercely held political agenda.
And even in the past several months, while her husband headed
Bush's vice presidential search team, Lynne Cheney advised the
presidential candidate on education policy.
</P>
<P>
   IN A WAY, BAUER STILL WILL HAVE A SAY
</P>
<P>
   There was a time earlier this year when Gary Bauer could conjure
up a dream of being on the podium at the Republican convention,
accepting his party's nomination. But the ex-head of the
conservative Family Research Council ended up as little more than a
statistical blip in the first tallies of caucus and primary votes.
But he'll still be going to the GOP convention _ and to the
Democratic convention after that _ as a correspondent for an
Internet site, Beliefnet.com, which features news and commentary on
religions in America. Bauer's job will be to file daily audio
reports and write an analytical article examining the role religion
plays in Republican politics.
</P>
<P>
   BALLOT CHALLENGE TO BUCHANAN COMING UP
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of Pat Buchanan will attempt this weekend to
invalidate more than 250,000 ballots requested for Buchanan
supporters in a plebiscite to determine the Reform Party's
presidential nominee. ``Buchanan is essentially stuffing the ballot
box,'' Russell Verney, a former chairman of the party founded by
Ross Perot. The party's 10-member executive committee will take up
the issue at a meeting in Dallas on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   GALS GOTTA STICK TOGETHER
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's because they are part of such a rare group. Perhaps
it's because they just plain like each other and work well
together. Or, more likely, a combination of all three. But nine
women senators _ six Democrats, three Republicans _ have said they
won't campaign against one another. The nine senators were
promoting their joint project, the just released book ``Nine and
Counting: The Women of the Senate.'' Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.)
said that ``if my leadership asked me to go campaign against one of
these women, I have told them I won't go.'' In the Senate's
211-year history, there have been only 27 female members, and 12 of
them were appointed to fill temporary vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   THERE GO YOUR DEFENSE DOLLARS
</P>
<P>
   Although the military services say they are stretched too thin
and short on money, they plan to deploy troops to Philadelphia this
weekend to display aircraft, tanks and other weaponry for
Republican members of Congress attending the convention. The
Pentagon is prohibited from associating with partisan events.
Spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Pentagon lawyers decided there would
be no violation, because approval for the military exhibits was ``a
legitimate response to a request from members of Congress to
provide an opportunity to educate elected officials on the
military's capabilities and their equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   PARTY TIME ALMOST ALL THE TIME
</P>
<P>
   There'll be dozens of parties thrown for the conventioneers:
afternoon cocktail hours for nearly every state delegation and
late-night soirees galore. Coveted events include a George magazine
benefit at the new Kenneth Cole store and a star-studded Hollywood
party at the Shampoo nightclub. In addition, there'll be a
colossal-sized ``Fight Night'' party at the Philadelphia Navy Yard
with boxing greats Joe Frazier and Larry Holmes. Among the party
attraction is a Richard Nixon-inspired vodka drink said to produce
an 18-minute gap in memory.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT KIND OF SHELF LIFE FOR MCCAIN?
</P>
<P>
   John McCain is counting on his continued popularity to keep him
in the limelight, both during the Republican convention and the
rest of campaign season as he stumps for congressional candidates.
But how long can political celebrity last for someone whose
presidential campaign peaked with a string of primary wins in
February and had crashed and burned by late March? ``The nominee is
king at his convention, and the losers appear to be Lilliputians,
even McCain,'' said University of Virginia political scientist
Larry Sabato.
</P>
<P>
   TAKES MORE THAN COFFEE TO GET WIRED
</P>
<P>
   The red, white and blue balloons are filled, but a lot of wiring
remains to be done just days before the opening of the Republican
convention on Monday. While workers put finishing touches on the
stage and set up thousands of metal chairs for the delegates inside
the convention hall, some news outlets still lacked the necessary
electrical hookups to connect to their home offices or the
Internet. ``All this stuff was supposed to be done by Monday,''
said Terry Barrett, systems administrator for the Dallas Morning
News.
</P>
<P>
   PELOSI THINKS SHE'LL BE CRACKING THE WHIP
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California says she has enough support from
fellow Democrats to become majority whip, the No. 3 position in the
House leadership, if her party wins control of the chamber in the
November elections. In her most confident statement yet about her
prospects for capturing the post, Pelosi said that if Democratic
lawmakers were to vote today, she would defeat her rival, Rep.
Steny Hoyer of Maryland. The whip acts as the chief vote counter
and works to rally party members to support the leadership.
</P>
<P>
   HE'S NOT REALLY A DOCTOR, HE JUST PLAYS ONE ON . . .
</P>
<P>
   Attacking her opponent as ``out of touch with the mainstream,''
Hillary Clinton seemed to take some delight in pointing to Rick
Lazio's links to a dissident band of scientists who contend that
the human immunodeficiency virus does not cause AIDS. Lazio wrote
to federal health officials earlier this year on behalf of the
Group for the Scientific Reappraisal of HIV/AIDS. The group is
connected to two scientists, Peter Deusberg and David Resnick, to
whom the South African President Thabo Mbeki also apparently turned
earlier this year in questioning the causes of AIDS. Lazio's aides
said he just wrote the letter on behalf of a constituent who
belonged to the group.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unsettled conditions will dominate the Ohio Valley, Appalachians
and lower Great Lakes as a large, slow-moving disturbance becomes
better organized over Indiana. Increasingly humid air streaming
north from the Gulf of Mexico will be lifted by a jet-stream
disturbance in the middle Mississippi Valley. Potent thunderstorms
will drench sections of Kentucky, Ohio and Tennessee. Sluggish
storms in the Appalachians may trigger flash flooding in a few
spots.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure over Nova Scotia will direct mild, moist air into
the Northeast from the ocean. Low clouds will stubbornly persist
from New Jersey to Maine, with many places staying overcast. The
air will be humid, but readings will be below seasonal levels.
</P>
<P>
   Warm, dry air will occupy the Plains. The return flow of
moisture into the eastern Rockies will lead to afternoon
thunderstorms from New Mexico to southern Montana. The interior
West will stay hot and dry.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: SHORT SUMMER
</P>
<P>
   The first July snow since just before the bicentennial fell on
Kotzebue, Alaska, on Thursday. Snow whitened the Kigluaik mountains
north of Nome as well. Afternoon readings rose to only 41 degrees
in Kotzebue, 4 degrees lower than the previous chilliest July 27.
Summer does not last long in northwest Alaska, but the 20 hours
plus of daylight usually fends off the invasion of polar air masses
in late July. However, unusually frigid air arrived from Siberia
this week.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a simple question: Can the swastika ever be redeemed?
</P>
<P>
   Before the Nazi Party adopted the swastika and turned it into
the most potent icon of racial hatred, it traveled the world as a
good luck symbol. It was known in France, Germany, Britain,
Scandinavia, China, Japan, India and the United States. Buddha's
footprints were said to be swastikas. Navajo blankets were woven
with swastikas. Synagogues in North Africa, Palestine and Hartford,
Conn., were built with swastika mosaics.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is a small movement afoot to help ``the swastika get
on with its benign life,'' to separate it from ``the sins of the
Nazis.'' Is that really possible? Should it be possible?
</P>
<P>
   The swastika gets its name from the Sanskrit word svastika,
meaning well-being and good fortune. The earliest known swastikas
date from 2500 or 3000 B.C. in India and in Central Asia. A 1933
study suggests that the swastika migrated from India across Persia
and Asia Minor to Greece, then to Italy and on to Germany, probably
in the first millennium B.C.
</P>
<P>
   The fateful link was made by the German archaeologist Heinrich
Schliemann. From 1871 to 1875, Schliemann excavated the site of
Homer's Troy on the shores of the Dardanelles. When he found
artifacts with swastikas, he quickly associated them with the
swastikas he had seen near the Oder River in Germany. As Steven
Heller, the art director of The New York Times Book Review, writes
in ``The Swastika: Symbol Beyond Redemption,'' ``Schliemann
presumed that the swastika was a religious symbol of his German
ancestors which linked ancient Teutons, Homeric Greeks and Vedic
India.''
</P>
<P>
   Pretty soon swastikas were everywhere, rotating both clockwise
and counterclockwise. Madame Blavatsky, the founder of the
Theosophical Society, included the swastika in the seal of the
society. ``Rudyard Kipling combined a swastika with his signature
in a circle as a personal logo,'' Heller reports. And the swastika
was part of the logo of the Bauhaus, under Paul Klee.
</P>
<P>
   The swastika spread to the United States, too. Coca-Cola issued
a swastika pendant. Carlsberg beer etched swastikas onto its
bottles. During World War I, the American 45th Infantry division
wore an orange swastika as a shoulder patch. At least one railway
had swastikas on some of its cars. The Girls' Club published a
magazine called The Swastika. And until 1940, the Boy Scouts gave
out a swastika badge.
</P>
<P>
   How did the Nazis get hold of it? According to Heller, the
Germanen order, an anti-Semitic group that wore helmets with Wotan
horns and plotted ``against Jewish elements in German life,'' used
a curved swastika on a cross as its insignia. By 1914, the
Wandervogel, a German youth movement, made it a nationalist emblem.
</P>
<P>
   The Nazi party did not claim it until around 1920. In ``Mein
Kampf,'' Hitler, who had artistic aspirations as well as political
ones, described ``his quest to find the perfect symbol for the
party.'' He toyed with the idea of using swastikas. But it was
Friedrich Krohn, a dentist from Starnberg, who designed the flag
with a black swastika in its center. ``Hitler's major
contribution,'' Heller writes, ``was to reverse the direction of
the swastika'' so that it appears to spin clockwise.
</P>
<P>
   The swastika came down as quickly as it ascended. In 1946, it
was constitutionally banned from any public display in Germany. In
the United States, there has never been a law prohibiting the
display of swastikas, but the aversion is still there.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is, should the swastika be reclaimed from the
Nazis or should it, as Heller argues, continue to represent their
``unspeakable crimes''?
</P>
<P>
   The issue is complicated by the swastika's history in India and
other parts of Asia, where it has none of the connotations it has
in the West. In India, there is Swastik soap; in Malaysia, a
Swastika photograph studio; in Japan, there are Pokemon cards that
have ``manji,'' counterclockwise swastikas; in China, the Falun
Gong uses the counterclockwise swastika as its emblem.
</P>
<P>
   And now swastikas have crept back into sight in the Western
world.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, for example, the swastika was a recurring motif in
geometric abstract art and hard-edge painting, notably in an
exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum.
</P>
<P>
   But the most concerted effort to redeem the swastika comes from
Friends of the Swastika, a group formed in 1985 and based in the
United States. The group, whose Web site promises that it ``has no
connections to any racist propaganda'' and no intention of denying
the Holocaust, is led by an artist named ManWoman who claims to
have 200 swastikas tattooed on his body. In order to ``detoxify''
and ``resanctify'' the swastika, the group sells T-shirts, stamps,
postcards and ``other cool stuff'' with swastikas. Their watchword
is, ``To hell with Hitler!''
</P>
<P>
   And already, they say, their mission is working. ``The swastika
is re-emerging in the alternative pop culture ... in the punk rock
world, in the flying saucer cults, in the street gangs.'' There are
teenagers wearing swastikas just because they think they look cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1973 film `Sleeper,''' Heller notes, ``Woody Allen
sarcastically predicted that in the distant future, the swastika
will be worn as a fashion accessory.'' The distant future is now.
</P>
<P>
   It has become an icon of rebellion. The logo for ZZ Flex
skateboards looks a lot like a swastika. The label on the heavy
metal CD Sacred Reich has interlocking swastikas. The logo for the
band Kiss, which originally had three Jewish members, was made to
look just like the insignia of the SS _ not a swastika but rather
two parallel, jagged s's made to look like lightning.
</P>
<P>
   Does it matter whether swastikas are used in ignorance or in
hatred or to rehabilitate a symbol? No, Heller says: ``Nazi icons
were strong enough to seduce a nation and still contain a graphic
power that can be unleashed today.'' The swastika defenders counter
with the question: ``How can a symbol be guilty for the acts of a
madman?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a simple question: Can the swastika ever be redeemed?
</P>
<P>
   Before the Nazi Party adopted the swastika and turned it into
the most potent icon of racial hatred, it traveled the world as a
good luck symbol. It was known in France, Germany, Britain,
Scandinavia, China, Japan, India and the United States. Buddha's
footprints were said to be swastikas. Navajo blankets were woven
with swastikas. Synagogues in North Africa, Palestine and Hartford,
Conn., were built with swastika mosaics.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is a small movement afoot to help ``the swastika get
on with its benign life,'' to separate it from ``the sins of the
Nazis.'' Is that really possible? Should it be possible?
</P>
<P>
   The swastika gets its name from the Sanskrit word svastika,
meaning well-being and good fortune. The earliest known swastikas
date from 2500 or 3000 B.C. in India and in Central Asia. A 1933
study suggests that the swastika migrated from India across Persia
and Asia Minor to Greece, then to Italy and on to Germany, probably
in the first millennium B.C.
</P>
<P>
   The fateful link was made by the German archaeologist Heinrich
Schliemann. From 1871 to 1875, Schliemann excavated the site of
Homer's Troy on the shores of the Dardanelles. When he found
artifacts with swastikas, he quickly associated them with the
swastikas he had seen near the Oder River in Germany. As Steven
Heller, the art director of The New York Times Book Review, writes
in ``The Swastika: Symbol Beyond Redemption,'' ``Schliemann
presumed that the swastika was a religious symbol of his German
ancestors which linked ancient Teutons, Homeric Greeks and Vedic
India.''
</P>
<P>
   Pretty soon swastikas were everywhere, rotating both clockwise
and counterclockwise. Madame Blavatsky, the founder of the
Theosophical Society, included the swastika in the seal of the
society. ``Rudyard Kipling combined a swastika with his signature
in a circle as a personal logo,'' Heller reports. And the swastika
was part of the logo of the Bauhaus, under Paul Klee.
</P>
<P>
   The swastika spread to the United States, too. Coca-Cola issued
a swastika pendant. Carlsberg beer etched swastikas onto its
bottles. During World War I, the American 45th Infantry division
wore an orange swastika as a shoulder patch. At least one railway
had swastikas on some of its cars. The Girls' Club published a
magazine called The Swastika. And until 1940, the Boy Scouts gave
out a swastika badge.
</P>
<P>
   How did the Nazis get hold of it? According to Heller, the
Germanen order, an anti-Semitic group that wore helmets with Wotan
horns and plotted ``against Jewish elements in German life,'' used
a curved swastika on a cross as its insignia. By 1914, the
Wandervogel, a German youth movement, made it a nationalist emblem.
</P>
<P>
   The Nazi party did not claim it until around 1920. In ``Mein
Kampf,'' Hitler, who had artistic aspirations as well as political
ones, described ``his quest to find the perfect symbol for the
party.'' He toyed with the idea of using swastikas. But it was
Friedrich Krohn, a dentist from Starnberg, who designed the flag
with a black swastika in its center. ``Hitler's major
contribution,'' Heller writes, ``was to reverse the direction of
the swastika'' so that it appears to spin clockwise.
</P>
<P>
   The swastika came down as quickly as it ascended. In 1946, it
was constitutionally banned from any public display in Germany. In
the United States, there has never been a law prohibiting the
display of swastikas, but the aversion is still there.

Nazis or should it, as Heller argues, continue to represent their

 &HT;    DEBRIS FROM BLOWN CONCORDE TIRES MAY HAVE LED TO CRASH, FRENCH
OFFICIALS SAY
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GONESSE, France _ A blown tire that apparently threw off debris
as the doomed Air France Concorde took off Tuesday may have set off
a chain of events that led to the supersonic aircraft's fiery crash
that killed 114 people, the French government said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the fire that began before the Concorde became airborne
probably began outside the engines, suggesting that tire debris may
have punctured fuel lines or tanks in the wings, investigators
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the information available at present to this body, it
emerges that at least one tire burst, something that could have
triggered a chain of events, damage to the plane's structure, a
fire and engine failure,'' French Transport Minister Jean-Claude
Gayssot said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Gayssot ordered the nation's aviation authorities to develop
safety measures that would allow Air France to resume its Concorde
flights. The airline said Friday that the flights were suspended
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Concorde tires have blown out on takeoff before. U.S. safety
inspectors warned French counterparts in a November 1981 report to
change Air France Concorde procedures after four ``potentially
catastrophic'' cases of blown tires on takeoff from New York and
Washington area airports in a 20-month period.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious incident occurred on June 14, 1979 when two
tires on an Air France Concorde blew out at Washington's Dulles
Airport casting off metal and rubber fragments that punctured wing
fuel tanks and damaged an engine.
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board
recommended modifications to the landing gear, which were made. The
NTSB released copies of its 19-year-old recommendations Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Passenger Bill Lightfoot, then an aviation consultant headed for
the Paris Air Show, recalled Friday having seen something zip by
his window _ vertically _ as the wheels left the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see a hole in the wing _ a big, jagged hole in the
wing, with liquid gushing'' that turned out to be fuel, said
Lightfoot, now a vice president of a major U.S. defense contractor.
Only after he threatened to storm the cockpit did the flight
attendants send back the co-pilot to look.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says 'Mon Dieu' and the guy just turned white,'' Lightfoot
recounted in a telephone interview with the Reuters News Agency.
Before the crew realized what had happened and turned the flight
around, the aircraft had been Paris-bound over the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Air France on Friday refused to speculate as to the whether a
burst tire could have triggered Tuesday's fatal crash.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, French investigators found the body of another
victim in the hotel destroyed when the Concorde crashed into it.
This raises the death toll to 114. That number includes the four
other people died on the ground, and all 109 passengers and
crewmembers aboard Air France Flight 4590.
</P>
<P>
   The French Bureau of Accident Investigations, or the BEA, said
in a statement Friday that at least one of the Concorde's four
tires on the left wing burst on takeoff before it crashed. The BEA
also said the flames seen on the left side of the aircraft during
takeoff appeared to have started outside the engines.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the present time, no debris from inside the engine has been
identified,'' the BEA said. ``The fire appears to have started
outside the engines, but this remains to be determined.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Amar, an aviation advisor to the French government, told
CNN that debris from the tire could have led to the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``This probably made some holes in the structures, and it's
possible that some fuel came from the aircraft on the back of the
aircraft,'' Amar said. ``On the engines, this could have made a
very big fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Former pilot and aviation expert Germain Chambost said on French
television that the Concorde's engines could have been damaged
after ingesting the tire debris. ``At full takeoff speed, a tire
that penetrates at that moment in the engine could cause very
serious damage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The BEA said Thursday that one of the two left-side engines
faltered twice during takeoff, while the other failed in the blaze
that streamed fire 200 feet behind the Concorde during its
two-minute flight.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said the plane could not even retract its landing
gear, and left behind a trail of debris on the runway, including
tire parts.
</P>
<P>
   At the crash-scene here in Gonesse, an industrial suburb north
of Paris, investigators began to chart the charred wreckage, hoping
to find thousands of parts to be taken to a French Air Force base
for storage.
</P>
<P>
   The families of the victims began the heart-breaking task of
providing forensic specialists with personal information about
their loved ones, such as the clothes or jewelry that they were
wearing, so bodies can be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Air France chairman Jean-Cyril Spinetta met Friday with families
of mainly German victims to tell them about the progress of the
crash investigation. He also led a remembrance service held at the
company's head-office at Charles de Gaulle International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Spinetta spoke of ``the same emotion, the same compassion, the
same infinite sadness'' uniting company staff, ``touching us _ both
flyers and the personnel on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The first names of each of the dead were read individually like
a solemn dirge: ``Jean, Marie . . . '' The service was punctuated
periodically by the roar of jets on a nearby runway.
</P>
<P>
   As the mourners in their navy blue Air France uniforms left the
service, their grief was visible. Many women sobbed and one woman
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   In Gonesse, nearly 1,500 residents, many carrying flowers,
staged a procession from the town hall to the crash site in
remembrance of the crash victims.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the marchers were Gonesse Mayor Jean-Pierre Blazy and
Michele Fricheteau, the hotel manager who survived the crash. She
and other hotel employees, many with tears in their eyes, were the
first to lay flowers near a fence erected by police at the crash
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to pay homage to the people who are dead, those who
worked for me,'' said Fricheteau, whose face and hands were in
bandages.

BUSH AND CHENEY TRY TO WIN BACK ARKANSAS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SPRINGDALE, Ark. _ Republicans George W. Bush and Dick Cheney on
Friday recalled the impeachment of President Clinton and vowed to
restore ``dignity and honor'' to the White House as they kicked off
their five-day, five-state journey to the GOP convention with a
symbolic foray into the heart of Clinton country.
<P>
   Bush and Cheney ignited a rally of several thousand partisans at
the local high school in this Ozark mountain community in
northwestern Arkansas with promises to win back Arkansas and four
other swing states that have not voted Republican at least since
1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``It buoys my spirit to know as we're working our way to
Philadelphia for the national convention and working our way across
battleground states that the Republican ticket has not been able to
carry for the last two election cycles that our first stop is a
place that will send a resounding signal to America that Arkansas
is Bush-Cheney country, `' Bush told the roaring crowd. Neither
Bush nor Cheney nor their host, Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark.,
directly mentioned the moral lapses or impeachment of Clinton on
charges of perjury and obstruction of justice in connection with
the president's dalliance with former White House intern Monica
Lewinski. Nor did any of the candidates mention Clinton or
Democratic rival Al Gore by name.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, Cheney and Hutchinson frequently made indirect
references that recalled the moral crisis and 1998 impeachment
struggle that saw the GOP-led House vote to impeach Arkansas'
native son and the Republican Senate refuse to oust him from
office. Hutchinson, a popular former federal prosecutor and
two-term member of Congress who is running unopposed this fall, is
a local hero here after serving as one of the 13 House managers who
pressed the case for Clinton's impeachment before the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   When an unidentified member of the audience shouted ``No slick
Willie!'' _ a disparaging reference to Clinton _ Hutchinson,
speaking at the podium, told Bush: ``We believe you have the right
instincts to lead America because your instincts have been shaped
by experience, rooted in principle. Inspired by faith and tempered
by compassion.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Cheney took turns praising each other.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, the former Wyoming congressman, defense secretary and
oil services company executive, said Bush would ``give our kids and
our grand kids a government we can once again be proud of.'' Bush
praised Cheney as a man of integrity who ``will help me bring
dignity and honor'' to the White House, adding that Cheney is ``a
man who understands what the definition of `is', is.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's quip was a cryptic reference to Clinton's verbal
gymnastics during videotaped grand jury testimony about sexual
relations with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   To drive home his effort to contrast himself with Clinton, Bush
said he would be sworn in as president on the steps of the Capitol
by holding up his right hand and taking the oath not only to uphold
the U.S. constitution but also ``the honor and dignity of the
highest office in the land.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson said in an interview with Hearst Newspapers that Bush
and Cheney would ``represent the America that we want in the White
House,'' adding: ``Both of them conduct themselves in a way that
gives us pride in our country as well as pride in the presidency.
How they conduct themselves is extraordinarily important and I
think that will be a subtle backdrop to the campaign this fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the two-term governor of Texas and son of former President
George Bush, appeared energized and animated as he embarked on his
long-awaited journey to receive the GOP nomination in Philadelphia
next Thursday. He told reporters aboard his campaign plane that
receiving the nomination is ``an unbelievable, interesting, dynamic
moment in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spotlighted a variety of campaign promises that he hopes
will help him win the White House in November. He cited plans to
overhaul education to make sure there are ``no second rate children
in America.'' He said he would revamp the federal tax code to offer
billions of dollars in fresh tax breaks. He promised to eliminate
federal inheritance taxes. He said he would press for changes to
enable younger workers to invest part of their federally withheld
Social Security taxes in the stock market. The Republicans' first
joint campaign foray since a whirlwind visit to Cheney's native
Wyoming on Wednesday targeted an area of Arkansas adjacent to the
Democratic stronghold in Fayetteville, Ark., where Bill Clinton
taught law at the University of Arkansas in the early 1970s, where
Clinton tried to win a seat in Congress in 1974 and where Clinton
and Hillary Rodham got married in 1975. Bush and Cheney are
visiting Arkansas, Missouri, Kentucky, West Virginia and Ohio _
swing states that have not voted for a Republican for president at
least since 1988. Karen Hughes, Bush's campaign spokeswoman, said
there was ``some symbolism'' in the Bush campaign's decision to
make Arkansas his first stop, adding: ``We are not ceding any
territory. We're going after every vote. Gov. Bush is going to
compete (and) is competitive in states where Republicans have not
done well in the last two elections.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton-Gore ticket carried the five states and their 51
electoral votes in the last two presidential elections. Clinton,
who served as governor of Arkansas for five-terms, carried his
native state in both of his presidential campaigns _ the first time
the largely rural state has voted for a Democrat since Jimmy Carter
in 1976. But this predominantly Republican congressional district
which has sent a Republican to Congress since 1967 spurned
Clinton's presidential bid in 1992 and 1996.

 &HT;    CLINTON ISSUES STERN WARNINGS TO PALESTINIANS ON ISRAELI TV
 &HT;    (700&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    With ISRAEL-JERUSALEM-0729.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In response to the failed Camp David peace talks,
President Bill Clinton went on Israeli television Friday and
sternly warned the Palestinians against declaring statehood without
Israeli approval.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he might take the controversial, pro-Israel step of
moving the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to the disputed
city of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke of his ``almost religious conviction'' to bring
peace to the Middle East. He praised Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and, indirectly, chided Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat for saying, ``no, no, no'' during the Camp David
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   The interview showed Clinton increasing the pressure, and
apparently heaping more of the blame, on the Palestinians for the
failure of the 15-day summit.
</P>
<P>
   The talks were aimed at ending the 52-year-old
Israeli-Palestinian conflict and centered on the toughest disputes
between the two sides. The biggest snag was over the city of
Jerusalem, which Israel controls but Palestinians want to use as
the capital of a new Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's participation in _ and apparent willingness to make
concessions at _ the summit increased his political problems at
home, where next week he faces attempts from opposition parties to
bring down his government.
</P>
<P>
   According to Israeli press reports, Barak asked Clinton for some
public support. He got that and more in Friday's half-hour
interview from the White House, taped and broadcast during prime
time on Israel's government news channel.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been popular here throughout his term in office. He
was last interviewed on Israeli television in 1998 after the
signing of the Wye River peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   He began Friday's interview by praising Barak's ``courageous
actions'' at the summit and sought to reassure Israelis of
America's support. He reiterated, in strong terms, American
readiness to provide aid for the modernization of the Israeli army.
</P>
<P>
   Israel currently receives nearly $3 billion annually in U.S.
aid, far more than any other country.
</P>
<P>
   He said further that, in light of the failed summit, he would
consider moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and almost all other countries refuse to
recognize disputed Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Much of the city
is occupied territory and Palestinians claim it should be their
capital.
</P>
<P>
   While the U.S. Congress has voted to move the embassy, Clinton
has used executive waivers to delay the move for fear of derailing
the peace process. Talk of moving it in the past has sparked riots
in Palestinian areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always wanted to move our embassy to West Jerusalem,''
Clinton said. ``I have not done so because I didn't want to do
anything to undermine our ability to help broker a secure and fair
and lasting peace for Israelis and for Palestinians.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But, in light of what happened,'' he said in apparent
reference to the Camp David summit failure, ``I've taken that
decision under review and I'll make a decision sometime between now
and the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   One influential Palestinian legislator said Clinton's
``threats'' would ``shock the Palestinians.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the summit failure, we have had some hope,'' said
Marwan Barghouti, a member of the Palestinian parliament and a key
Arafat aide. ``This will increase the tensions among the
Palestinians, and push them to feel more disappointed and
frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians frequently accuse U.S. officials of favoring Israel
in the peace talks and say that, as the weaker party, they have
already made major compromises to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But, it appeared that Barak was willing to go further than any
other Israeli prime minister in offering concessions at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton issued a solemn warning against Arafat's plans for a
so-called ``unilateral'' declaration of statehood on Sept. 13, the
day the 1993 Oslo peace accords officially expire. Israeli leaders
threaten to respond with military action.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said such a move by Arafat would force a review of the
``entire relationship'' between the U.S. and the Palestinians _
something Palestinians have tried hard to cultivate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a big mistake to take a unilateral action and walk
away from the peace process and if it happens, there will
inevitably be consequences,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Congress is considering a bill that would cut U.S.
aid to the Palestinians if they declare statehood unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would be willing to hold another summit, but
only when both sides are ready ``make the decisions necessary to
conclude an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton interview came on a day when Israeli papers printed
new details on the talks at Camp David, including instances where
Clinton was said to have yelled at Arafat over his hard-line
position. The reports said some Palestinian negotiators seemed more
flexible than Arafat did.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton acknowledged that the ``Palestinian side'' had made
concessions. But speaking about settling disputes, in general,
Clinton seemed to draw a comparison to Arafat and the cheering
welcome the he received from Palestinians when he returned from the
summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go out and say, 'no,' and you can get up the crowd and
they'll cheer you. But if that is the attitude which prevails, then
we won't get peace,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Amplifying an item that has received little mention since the
talks, Clinton also said that both Israelis and Palestinians were
interested in providing compensation to Jews who fled Arab
countries when Israel was founded.
</P>
<P>
   That would apparently be packaged with plans to compensate
Palestinians who fled from Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton scoffed when interviewer Gil Tamari asked if his Camp
David effort was meant to repair damage done to his reputation by
his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has nothing to do with my legacy,'' Clinton said. ``This
is not about me. It's about the children who live in the Middle
East. It's about whether those children will be living together, or
living apart.''

 &HT;    CLINTON ISSUES STERN WARNINGS TO PALESTINIANS ON ISRAELI TV
 &HT;    (700&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    With ISRAEL-JERUSALEM-0729.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In response to the failed Camp David peace talks,
President Bill Clinton went on Israeli television Friday and
sternly warned the Palestinians against declaring statehood without
Israeli approval.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he might take the controversial, pro-Israel step of
moving the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to the disputed
city of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke of his ``almost religious conviction'' to bring
peace to the Middle East. He praised Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and, indirectly, chided Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat for saying, ``no, no, no'' during the Camp David
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   The interview showed Clinton increasing the pressure, and
apparently heaping more of the blame, on the Palestinians for the
failure of the 15-day summit.
</P>
<P>
   The talks were aimed at ending the 52-year-old
Israeli-Palestinian conflict and centered on the toughest disputes
between the two sides. The biggest snag was over the city of
Jerusalem, which Israel controls but Palestinians want to use as
the capital of a new Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's participation in _ and apparent willingness to make
concessions at _ the summit increased his political problems at
home, where next week he faces attempts from opposition parties to
bring down his government.
</P>
<P>
   According to Israeli press reports, Barak asked Clinton for some
public support. He got that and more in Friday's half-hour
interview from the White House, taped and broadcast during prime
time on Israel's government news channel.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been popular here throughout his term in office. He
was last interviewed on Israeli television in 1998 after the
signing of the Wye River peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   He began Friday's interview by praising Barak's ``courageous
actions'' at the summit and sought to reassure Israelis of
America's support. He reiterated, in strong terms, American
readiness to provide aid for the modernization of the Israeli army.
</P>
<P>
   Israel currently receives nearly $3 billion annually in U.S.
aid, far more than any other country.
</P>
<P>
   He said further that, in light of the failed summit, he would
consider moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and almost all other countries refuse to
recognize disputed Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Much of the city
is occupied territory and Palestinians claim it should be their
capital.
</P>
<P>
   While the U.S. Congress has voted to move the embassy, Clinton
has used executive waivers to delay the move for fear of derailing
the peace process. Talk of moving it in the past has sparked riots
in Palestinian areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always wanted to move our embassy to West Jerusalem,''
Clinton said. ``I have not done so because I didn't want to do
anything to undermine our ability to help broker a secure and fair
and lasting peace for Israelis and for Palestinians.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But, in light of what happened,'' he said in apparent
reference to the Camp David summit failure, ``I've taken that

and the end of the year.''

L'UNITA, ONCE A POWERFUL LEFTIST VOICE, SUSPENDS PUBLICATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ L'Unita, once the most powerful leftist newspaper in
Italy, published what was probably its last issue Friday, a victim
of the fall of the Berlin Wall and market forces.
</P>
<P>
   The front page carried a blurred picture of its maiden issue of
Feb. 12, 1924, above a poignant editorial by the editor in chief.
``We are dying of debts,'' the editor, Giuseppe Caldarola, wrote.
``We are dying of an insane financial crisis. But can so vital a
part of the history of the left die this way?''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper, which went into receivership two weeks ago but
was unable to reach agreements with potential buyers, formally
``suspended'' publication. It hoped that in the fall some solution
could emerge to rescue the newspaper, which has a debt of $33
million, 123 journalists and a support staff of 70, and a
hemorrhaging circulation of about 50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats of the Left, which split from the hard-core
Communist Party in 1991 and is now Italy's largest center-left
party, said it would try to find a way to salvage the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Other politicians and intellectuals mourned the likely passing
of an Italian institution.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1924 by Antonio Gramsci as the mouthpiece of the
Italian Communist Party, L'Unita was at the forefront of
anti-Fascism before World War II, and was forced to publish
underground irregularly for the last years of the war. At times,
clandestine copies of the paper rallied resistance to Mussolini and
Hitler. L'Unita returned to the newsstands in 1944 after the allies
liberated Rome from German occupation. The newspaper reached its
zenith during the 1970s, when it was the most closely heeded voice
of opposition to the ruling center-right Christian Democratic
Party, selling as many as a million copies on May 1, the European
labor day.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the training ground for generations of Italian
politicians. Massimo d'Alema, who became Italy's first, if
short-lived, former Communist prime minister, was the editor of
L'Unita in the late 1980s. Walter Veltroni, who is leader of the
Democrats of the Left, was one of his successors in the newsroom,
one who sought to make it more lively and competitive. In 1997,
L'Unita entered the private sector, when the party sold most of its
shares to private shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   As bankruptcy loomed earlier this year, the newspaper returned
to direct party management, and Veltroni said the party was
spending $1 million a month on it.
</P>
<P>
   In a related symptom of the decline of the left's strength in
Italy, The Democrats of the Left party is moving out of its
historic headquarters on the Via delle Botteghe Oscure in central
Rome, an address that for decades carried leftist mystique. The
party sold off most of its real estate two years ago, including the
headquarters, but stayed on as renters. In the fall, the party will
move to less expensive offices on the Via Nazionale.
</P>
<P>
   Like all other newspapers that are party organs, and there are
more than 30 in Italy, L'Unita received government subsidies. In
1998, the newspaper received about $4 million from the state, in
addition to party funds, but that was not enough to keep it afloat.
Few other party newspapers have as large a staff, or aspire to a
large circulation.
</P>
<P>
   L'Unita's decline began in the mid-1980s, when La Repubblica, a
sprightlier center-left newspaper, came into its own, siphoning off
thousands of readers. The collapse of communism around the world,
which caused the Democrats of the Left to split from the Communist
Party, also helped seal the newspaper's doom.
</P>
<P>
   In its heyday, party members would volunteer to help with
distribution and sales of the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is increased disaffection among party supporters, and
that too has made it difficult for L'Unita to maintain its market
position,'' Antonio Pilati, director of the Institute of Media
Economics, explained. ``L'Unita's real problem is to discover a
market niche that is different from La Repubblica. If not, it will
be very difficult to keep the paper alive only on public funding.''

 &HT;    Rockin and a reelin revival radioBy Kim Sue Lia Perkes
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Have you ever heard the Rolling Stones sing
gospel?
</P>
<P>
   How about Humble Pie, Jimi Hendrix, the Beach Boys or Janis
Joplin?
</P>
<P>
   Do you know Willie Nelson used to be a Sunday school teacher and
once sold Bibles door-to-door? Or have you ever heard blues great
Billie Holiday's ``God Bless the Child?''
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to two guys in the Live Music Capital of the World to
come up with an alternative to contemporary Christian radio. The
``Roadhouse Revival'' radio show is reeling in music lovers of all
faiths and is on the verge of going national.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with a magazine and now the radio program, the pair,
rock 'n' roll drummers and fixtures in Austin's music scene, have
found a way to seal their devotion to the mastery of secular
musicians and their worship of God.
</P>
<P>
   For John Peyton, also a harmonica player, and Randy Hill, it's
all about breaking new ground and hitting the right chord _ even it
occasionally strikes a sour note.
</P>
<P>
   ``People might say, `Well, you got Willie Nelson. He smokes
dope,''' Peyton said. ``Well, maybe, but he sings `Amazing Grace'
really well.''
</P>
<P>
   Peyton and Hill, both secular recording artists and Christians,
are the founders, producers and disc jockeys for the show. The
twosome, who also own the Christian arts, entertainment and
lifestyle magazine True Believer, reach an often overlooked market:
mainstream Christians.
</P>
<P>
   You know, the people who believe in Jesus but do not proselytize
or talk about being born-again during most of their waking hours.
The ones who don't make disparaging remarks about people of other
faiths and admit they like watching television, reading racy novels
and drinking alcoholic beverages.
</P>
<P>
   That audience is so large that Ingram _ one of the biggest names
in Christian publishing _ will begin distributing the next issue of
True Believer nationwide. And only seven months since its debut,
Peyton and Hill are in negotiations with another company to
nationally distribute the ``Roadhouse Revival.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no shows coming out of Austin like this,'' said Jim
``Jimbo'' Kipping, creative services director for LBJS
Broadcasting, which own five radio stations including KLBJ-FM.
</P>
<P>
   Kipping pieces the show together each week. It begins with a
bedroom studio run through at Kipping's home where the three work
on the song selection. Then it's a day at the radio station studio
working on the voice material before the show rolls out in a Sunday
morning slot.
</P>
<P>
   Though they have gotten some criticism from conservative
Christian camps, the magazine and radio show are receiving support
from conservative, moderate and liberal Christians. The program is
even attracting a non-Christian listening audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `Roadhouse Revival' is to reach the unreached and tell the
untold,'' Peyton said. ``It's a come-as-you-are radio show where
you don't have to change to like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will hear the most talented people on the planet.''
</P>
<P>
   The show also honors gospels greats like Mahalia Jackson and
Austin's Bells of Joy.
</P>
<P>
   The variety not only crosses Christian lines but musical ones,
offering rock 'n' roll, blues, jazz, country, heavy metal, punk and
gospel. Between songs, Hill and Peyton offer mostly untold stories
about how the secular artists came to do the songs, quick tidbits
about their personal background and religious trends among the
artists that often go unnoticed by music reviewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric Clapton has dozen of gospel songs,'' Peyton said. ``He
puts a gospel song on each one of his albums.''
</P>
<P>
   The show airs at 6:30 a.m. Sundays on rock station KLBJ-FM and
is simulcast via the Internet. That exposure had led the show to
receive e-mails from listeners in other states and countries,
including England and Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   To find their material, Peyton and Hill scoured their own album
collections (for Gen-Xers, this is what music came on before the
invention of CDs, cassettes, and 8-tracks). They started hanging
out in record stores. ``We go to Goodwill and dig through there and
we go to the Internet,'' Hill said of their research.
</P>
<P>
   It's how they found Janis Joplin's 1969 Woodstock performance of
``Work Me Lord.'' And Linda Ronstadt's ``We Need a Whole Lot More
Jesus and A Lot Less Rock 'n' Roll.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Morrison, Kris Kristofferson, Lyle Lovett, Stevie Wonder,
Gladys Knight &AMP; the Pips, One Bad Pig, Bob Dylan, Louis Armstrong,
Taj Mahal, Doobie Brothers, Beatles and Elvis also get air time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all these artists that you wouldn't expect to be doing
Christian music,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't expect many of these artists to record
traditional hymns, but they have,'' Peyton said. ``For example, the
Rolling Stones' `You Gotta Move' is an old black, spiritual number
written by Fred McDowell and the Rev. Gary Davis.''

A SPANISH SUN FIRES A CARNIVAL THAT WON'T DIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 30)  
 By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   IBIZA, Spain _ It &UR;  &LR; was 11 a.m. on a bright and sunny morning in
the Balearics, the type of blue-sky day when one wants nothing more
than to sip sangria on a white sand beach and read Hemingway. Or
perhaps to stay up 24 hours straight listening to house music,
sweating like a pig in a fur coat and dancing with 10,000
strangers.
</P>
<P>
   The latter was the choice of Howard Boyle, 22, of Brighton,
England, who was dressed as (who else?) Elvis. He was doing all he
could to flag the attention of a bartender at the Space nightclub,
where the biggest weekly party in Europe was in its 12th hour and
still going strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I swear to you, it never ends,'' Boyle said, with his Elvis
wig in hand and a grin from sideburn to sideburn. ``And really,
now, why should it?''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Ibiza, the Mediterranean island whose carnivalesque
club scene makes Mardi Gras look like an ice-cream social. Parties
here don't end; they simply move to another location.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the revelers at Space, for example, would remain until
late afternoon, and then head to the Bora Bora beach, an idyllic
stretch of white sand a block away, where topless girls and
awestruck boys often dance until the sun goes down and the cycle
starts all over again.
</P>
<P>
   The common refrain at the clubs is a kind of dance-driven
decadence, underscored by loud to too-loud house or trance music,
or some derivative, each with enough beats per minute to give a
hummingbird agita.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for instance, the giant Monday night fiesta called
Manumission, a lavish night-to-day extravaganza held in an
arena-size club named Privilege. It regularly draws more than
10,000 people and sets new standards for sexually graphic, obscure
and just plain strange entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the spectacle included midgets on stilts, acrobats
dangling from the club's 100-foot ceiling, a wall of falling water,
and more thongs than a Sisquo video. The profusion of spangles,
glitter and body paint worn by the huge crowd probably had dire
environmental implications. This is where Elvis spent the first 11
hours of his night, bopping to nonstop music, all spun by
solemn-looking disc jockeys on a circular island in the middle of
the club's swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   Privilege is just one of at least a dozen huge discos on Ibiza,
which has transformed itself into a club-hopper's destination
resort. There are billboards advertising discos, a disco bus whose
drivers play techno and even disco package tours, like one from
Bring It On Travel that offers a package of seven nights,
round-trip airfare from New York and two free club passes for
$1,359. (Motto: ``On the beach till 7 p.m. In the clubs till 9
a.m.'')
</P>
<P>
   Ibiza has been known for discotheques since as far back as the
1970s, but it was in the late '80s, when the island became a focal
point of international rave culture, that the scene began gathering
new momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Today the crowds have never been bigger, with a majority of
clubbers from Britain. Of 1.35 million visitors who invaded during
the club season from June to mid-September last year, more than
500,000 were from England, according to the island's tourism
bureau, compared with 355,000 English tourists during all of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Well-known British clubs like Ministry of Sound, Cream and
Gatecrasher sponsor summer satellites in Ibiza, banking on the
appeal of star disc jockeys like Paul Okenfold. This summer, there
are more American DJs playing, including Junior Vasquez, part of
what island veterans call a growing American presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's loads of Americans,'' said Rod Lay, who runs the Trade
party, another London import, at Privilege. Celebrity sightings are
also on the rise, with local gossip sheets reporting Donna Karan,
Stella McCartney and Kate Moss on the island this summer.
</P>
<P>
   For average clubbers, the growing global electronica movement is
part of the draw, but it is also an open secret that many come here
to capitalize on the ready availability of party drugs like
Ecstasy, GHB and ketamine hydrochloride, an animal anesthetic known
as Special K.
</P>
<P>
   Pills of Ecstasy are especially cheap and plentiful, running $7
to $10 each _ the street rate is about $25 in New York _ with
dealers frequenting many of the clubs and bars, even working taxi
lines, where clubbers can wait for as long as two hours.
</P>
<P>
   All of which inspires some ``good old days'' sentimentality
among the veteran party people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Phil Collins being played here,'' said Boy George,
the pop star turned disc jockey, who has been a regular in Ibiza
clubs since 1988. He had just completed a set at Amnesia.
``Everybody stopped, and looked, and said `Why not?' and kept
dancing,'' he said. ``Things used to be much more experimental.''
</P>
<P>
   If Ibiza residents feel overwhelmed by the clubgoing hordes,
there have been few official moves to hold back the tide. Tourism
has made the island and its neighbor Majorca two of the richest
spots in Spain, and construction cranes loom all around the central
harbor. Residents seem to express any ambivalence simply by
patronizing their own bars and restaurants, separate from the
megaclubs.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the only thing that hasn't changed is the island itself,
with its exceptionally strong sun, plenteous white sand beaches and
rolling landscape dotted with olive and pine trees, vineyards and
windmills. In short, a great place to spend lots of time sweating
in dark, loud rooms, which is exactly what I did on a 48-hour tour
of the clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Most don't open before 11 p.m. or midnight, and the concept of
arriving too late is unheard of. ``I'll be there at 3 a.m.,'' one
promoter told me. He was an hour late.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the low-budget clubbers take advantage of the disco bus,
a midnight-to-6 a.m. limited on which partiers, male and female,
adjust their makeup. Its main route is east from Ibiza town, the
island's major port and capital, to San Antonio, an unruly beach
town that is home to some of the older clubs with lower cover
prices.
</P>
<P>
   The major one here is Es Paradis Terrenal (Paradise on Earth). A
quick visit proved enlightening: Paradise apparently includes air
hockey machines, a gift boutique and go-go dancers. I felt
reassured about my afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   Es Paradis is also home to one of the newest gimmicks on the
island: the Fiesta del Agua. As the name implies, water is
involved. Every Friday night the club inundates part of its dance
floor with a few inches of water and sprays the dancers. Female
clubbers who have experienced the Fiesta del Agua say they enjoy
the cool water on their warm bodies; male partygoers say they enjoy
exactly the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Ibiza town is home to Space, Pacha and a yacht club turned
nightclub, El Divino, where a popular night known as Miss
Moneypenny's is well known by the city's temporary and resident
transvestite communities.
</P>
<P>
   Between the two towns, on a treacherous stretch of unlighted
highway, are the two biggest clubs: Privilege and Amnesia. Amnesia
boasts twice-weekly dance-floor foam parties (6 feet of bubbles,
swimsuits not required). Its owner, Martin Ferrer, claims to be the
first man ever to fill a dance floor with foam. He said the idea
came to him in a dream. ``I just saw people dancing,'' he said.
``In bubbles.''

</P>
<P>
   With a capacity of 4,000 to 5,000 a night (depending on which
way the authorities are looking), $12 cocktails, and cover charges
sometimes topping $40, Amnesia seems to do well. The night I
visited, it was packed shoulder to shoulder with sweaty bodies.
``These clubs aren't making a fortune selling alcohol,'' a
publicist named Marcello told me. ``They're making a fortune
selling water.'' At $6 for a small bottle, I could see his point.
Amnesia's newest toy, a specially designed ``fog gun,'' blasted
jets of frozen air into the crowd, to great rejoicing.
</P>
<P>
   While Amnesia is big, there is apparently no club bigger than
Privilege, and no night bigger than Manumission at Privilege. The
night, started by the British team of Mike and Claire Manumission,
uses some 80 entertainers to amuse the crowd. Its graphically
sexual displays are legendary; on Monday, they included a group of
Puerto Rican strippers from New York, a troupe of Brazilian feather
dancers and a bodybuilder with a talent for contortion.
</P>
<P>
   The club, roughly the size of a small sporting arena, used to be
open-air but was forced to build a soaring steel roof several years
ago after complaints about the noise. Visual distraction abounds: a
two-story Buddha in the corner, three dozen disco balls hanging
over the dance floor in a small side room.
</P>
<P>
   Above the main dance floors are dozens of circular screens, on
which a constant stream of surreal images is projected; I seem to
remember a giant cube emblazoned with the word ``Orange'' intercut
with a Clara Bow movie. The images are all synchronized with the
pounding music, resulting in an effect just this side of
hallucination.
</P>
<P>
   Those standing in line to enter Manumission often take over an
hour to work their way from sidewalk to entrance, and though
everyone gets in eventually, the scene can be ugly. The night I
visited, fights nearly broke out amid would-be soccer rowdies who
were singing rival team songs. There were also other signs of
trouble, with a dealer openly offering samples of GHB.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, however, the vibe was reverential. The partiers, almost
all in their late teens and 20s, with two men for every woman, kept
their eyes peeled on Tall Paul, who led them through hours of
alternately soaring and screaming music without a break. For all
the eroticism of the floor shows, most people danced alone, which
is in the nature of the hyperkinetic music.
</P>
<P>
   The party would run until 10 a.m., when Privilege closed, and
then shift to Space, about seven miles away. Die-hards would travel
there, some hitchhiking, others walking like disco refugees.
</P>
<P>
   When I arrived after a nap, the party at Space was still on,
with about 300 people crowding the outside terrace, eating
watermelon, drinking and dancing to mellower fare, and 300 more
inside, still skipping along on the harder house music. To wake up,
I had a Red Bull _ a high-powered caffeine drink that is a club
favorite _ and then encountered Boyle, wearing his white Elvis
outfit and sporting 3-inch sideburns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, baby,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He told me he usually performed at Manumission, re-enacting the
King's demise in a Graceland bathroom for 10,000 appreciative fans.
On this night, however, his act had been foiled by ``some jealous
Spanish performers'' who he believed had stolen his toilet. (This
account could not be confirmed. Ever. In a million years.)
</P>
<P>
   He then launched into his personal story about how he got to
Ibiza. As far as I could follow, there was an affair with an older
woman, an Ozzy Osbourne concert and an initial ``three-day bender''
in Ibiza. Before he knew it, he said, he was Elvis. A friend
confirmed his status. ``He really looks like him,'' this jittery
young man said. ``A combination of the fat old one and the
good-looking young one.''
</P>
<P>
   I took my leave. It was 1 p.m., after all, and from the looks of
the blazing sun, the evening _ if not the party _ was over. I'll
admit I felt conflicted. The crowd at the front door of Space was
growing. And beyond the walls, the music, as it always is in Ibiza,
was still pumping.

   COLOMBIA-INTRO _ With the highest murder and kidnapping rates in
the world, a raging civil war, the worst recession in memory and
plummeting public confidence in the army and the government,
Colombia is facing the most dire crisis in its history. Thousands
of people are fleeing the country, while human rights activists
estimate another 1 to 2 million have been displaced internally by
repeated attacks by leftist guerrillas and right-wing paramilitary
groups. We profile two groups _ kidnap victims and displaced people
_ as a window into everyday life in Colombia. (Williams, Cox News

   COLOMBIA-KIDNAP _ BOGOTA, Colombia _ The families come to the
national radio station each week, clutching hand-written notes they
hope will somehow reach their kidnapped relatives. With an average
of 8 kidnappings a day, Colombia is a nation living in fear.
Leftist guerrillas and paramilitary groups have turned kidnapping
into a big business _ some 3,000 victims were snatched last year -
to raise money for their armies. We profile a few families of
kidnap victims who hope against hope they will somehow see their
loved ones again. (Williams, Cox News Service).

   COLOMBIA-DISPLACED _ BOGOTA, Colombia _ Libia Barahona watched
warring leftist guerrillas and right-wing paramilitaries battle in
her remote village for months, dodging bullets and hiding with her
five children. Finally, she fled, abandoning her small store and
restaurant, eventually making her way to Bogota, where she is now
homeless. Barahona is one more victim in the tidal wave of 1 to 2
million Colombians - mostly rural peasants - displaced by the
country's civil war. Human rights activists fear the US aid package
may only increase the flow of refugees as poor campesinos are
forced out of the countryside by crop eradication programs and the
escalating war between guerrillas and the Colombian army.

   MEXICO-MIGRATION _ SAN FELIPE TORRES MOCHAS, Mexico _ Like
millions of other young Mexicans, Eusebio de Haro set out for the
United States in May, confident he'd find work like he did before.
Instead De Haro was shot to death, allegedly, by an elderly Texas
rancher after he and another young man knocked on his door to ask
for water in a remote area near the Rio Grande. The option to the
United States for work is as deeply ingrained in De Haro's home
state as the Virgin of Guadalupe. But it is an option that appears
to be getting more deadly every day for those who choose to cross
the border illegally. Migration is probably the toughest of all
issues between these two countries. And Mexican President-elect
Vicente Fox, who is from De Haro's home state, has heightened the
profile even more, suggesting more visas for Mexican workers and
working toward an open border for the free flow of labor in as
little as 10 years. (Ferriss, Cox News Service).

Arkansas, laborers and harvesters to Texas and Georgia and others
states. We tell it from the perspective of a young social worker we

   GOPTV _ As RepubliH-YEARS _ PHILADELPHIA _ The George W. Bush
presidential campaign, which tried to navigate below the political
radar screens for months, maybe years, hit the TV screens with a
wooden speech by a governor not acclaimed as a great orator.
``Tomorrow,'' Bush said in March 1999 at the Austin Convention
Center, ``I will file papers forming an exploratory committee so I
can take the next step in considering a campaign for president of
the United States. This will allow my friends to begin assessing
the level of support for my candidacy and to begin raising funds.''
Support turned out to be good. Fund raising turned out even better.

Marcus is Home Depot's do-it-yourself culture personified.

tight U.S. labor market. Atlanta-based Home Depot plans to open
about 900 stores over the next three years, and it will have to
hire more than 200,000 workers to do that. Currently, new stores
open on the average of one every 43 hours. No problem, says Home

   HUNLEY _ For most of the 136 years since it became an icon of

buried in the soft mud at the bottom of Charleston Harbor _ lost,
then found, but always surprisingly safe from the ravages of time.
All that will change next month when a giant crane lifts the
Hunley, encrusted with marine growth, from its watery grave into
the sunlight of a Carolina summer. For Civil War and submarine
buffs the world over, raising the Hunley will mark the realization
of a dream. For archaeologists, it is the start of a race against
time _ one that will ultimately determine how many secrets locked
inside in the 40-foot submarine are uncovered. ``The minute the
Hunley reaches the surfaces, we will have a ticking time bomb on
our hands,'' says'' says Maria Jacobsen, the archaeologist who will
direct the excavation of the submarine in a state-of-the-art
laboratory at the old Charleston Navy Yard. (Toner, Atlanta

   SEUSS _ The enduring popularity of Dr. Seuss: Ann Jackson
Gallery in Roswell is selling Dr. Seuss prints for $2,000 or so a
pop, and apparently doing well. A musical _ ``The Seussical'' _ is
being readied for Broadway, set to open this fall. Random House
posthumously released one more kids' book based on a Seuss film

married to a presidential candidate. As first lady of Texas, Bush's

the online music industry's future. It is the third such suit MP3
has settled. Napster, meanwhile, may be warming up to the industry
a bit too, even as it prepares for a court-ordered shutdown at
midnight Friday. It contacted visitors of its site today and urged
them to buy CDs _ especially those made by artists who have come
out in favor of Napster's file sharing programs _ at music stores
and other retailers as part of a two-day ``buy-cott.'' Many Napster
fans had been urging a boycott of major record labels and CD stores
in protest to Wednesday's ruling against the controversial company.

change that, however, joining the boards of seven corporations and
investing in some of those firms. He also went to work as a
consultant for Philip Morris, the largest cigarette manufacturer
and one of the companies paying the state $4.8 billion to settle a

Orkin and its parent company, Atlanta-based Rollins Inc., are

performed improper chemical treatments, skipped annual inspections,
forged customer names on inspection slips, and misrepresented
warranties, leading to widespread termite damage. Orkin faces a
similar lawsuit in Alabama that has reached class-action status.
The company denies the charges in each case. In addition, the
Florida attorney general's office is investigating Orkin's
advertising and warranty practices. Bob Buchner, a Florida

IN SYRACUSE, N.Y., THE PROBLEM IS TOO MUCH HOUSING

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. _ If only it were near New York City, 403 Rowland
St. might be a handy home-buyer's dream. Sure, the side porch is
collapsing, the chimney is crumbling, and the big front windows
have been replaced by small squinty ones. But the vintage charms of
this turn-of-the-century house, including sturdy construction and
gingerbread trim, would probably look alluring to the
housing-hungry hordes in southern New York state.
</P>
<P>
   The view is quite different here, near the center of the state,
near the center of Syracuse, near the center of a working-class
neighborhood known as Skunk City. So it is hard to argue with
Millie Compeau, sitting on the porch of the tidy house where she
has lived for 89 of her 92 years, when she peers across Rowland
Street at No. 403 and decrees, ``That house should come down.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people are starting to agree. That is because Syracuse
has more houses _ a lot more houses _ than its 152,000 citizens
need or want. Like the place on Rowland Street, as many as 2,200 of
them are empty or abandoned, more than 10 percent of the houses
within the city limits.
</P>
<P>
   Boarded-up houses mar some of Syracuse's nicest neighborhoods
and fill blocks in some of the worst. Skunk City, where residents
say the namesake critters still roam at night, is somewhere in
between: a well-kept house is followed by a run-down place, then
another nice one, then an abandoned wreck _ or two or three.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is so bad that last fall, government and civic
leaders began the Syracuse Neighborhood Initiative to try to bring
back blighted areas of the city. Rep. James T. Walsh, a Republican
on the House Appropriations Committee, whose father grew up in
Skunk City, has already gotten $15 million in federal financing for
the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the project, many in Syracuse are embracing an idea
that has long been anathema to almost everyone trying to save urban
areas: demolishing houses _ and not rebuilding them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, getting money to do tear-downs is very hard,''
said Allison Lee, a senior official in the Albany office of the
federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. But after
touring areas where problem properties have been knocked down, she
said, ``I have to tell you, the neighborhoods are better.''
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse is not the only place upstate suffering from abandoned
housing, which afflicts almost every old city east of Detroit. But
perhaps because Syracuse is so small and is not a corporate or
government center, the problem seems more overwhelming than in
other cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ours is the most serious problem because we have the least
resources,'' said Eric Mower, an advertising executive who is
chairman of the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   How Syracuse came to such a pass is a tangled tale of failures
in public policies and changes in private tastes, but most of all,
of economics. The 1991 recession that hit all of New York state
came to Syracuse and would not leave. Long after the economy began
to rebound to the south, central New York stagnated.
</P>
<P>
   That is no longer true, at least on paper. New jobs have been
sprouting here at a faster pace than almost anywhere else north of
New York City, and unemployment is only 3.7 percent, well under the
national average of 4.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The housing market is improving, too, after dropping sharply in
the mid-1990s and treading water for years. Last year, the number
of houses sold in and around Syracuse rose more than 10 percent,
according to the Greater Syracuse Association of Realtors, and the
median price edged up to $82,500 (which is still less than the
median in 1994).
</P>
<P>
   Within the city, however, house prices still seem to be
dropping, according to a study by the federal Neighborhood
Reinvestment Corp. for the Syracuse Neighborhood Initiative. That
is, when houses sell at all. In Skunk City, there were just four
regular sales last year, according to the report. Tax auctions and
foreclosure sales have become the norm.
</P>
<P>
   City inspectors report that more than 1,000 houses in the city
remain vacant, and the number has been rising. Minchin G. Lewis,
the city auditor, says that the correct figure is more like 2,200,
based on the number of water meters that have been unused for a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The vacant houses that people see all over the city remind them
of the terrible economic times they have endured _ and help explain
why the good news announced by economists does not seem to have
sunk into the psyche of Syracuse's citizens. ``They're shellshocked
from the decline that has taken place,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   That was clear at a city council hearing, held on July 19 to
discuss plans to build a big mall in the city. Dozens of residents
spoke, and many described Syracuse in apocalyptic terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``This city is in a real crisis,'' said Melanie Duer, 43, who
after a disabling accident used her insurance settlement to buy and
fix up a small apartment building in Skunk City, near where she
grew up. In 1994, she told city officials, there were 6 vacant
houses on the main road between her building and downtown; today,
she said, there are 36.
</P>
<P>
   In a later interview, Duer expressed frustration with
politicians who, she said, find it easy to overlook her
neighborhood. When President and Hillary Clinton visited Syracuse
last year, the president played golf less than a mile away from her
building, ``but it might as well have been in Zimbabwe,'' she said.
``They could really make a difference if they walked on this
street. I'm just one voice with a weed whacker.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, Skunk City does not look like a slum. Each one-
or two-family house has a little strip of grass in the front and a
plot in the back, with just enough room for a shed or a garage.
Many of the houses are trim and tidy. Marigolds and petunias edge
walks. Children of all colors ride their bicycles up and down the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   Hang around for a while, however, and problems appear. Drug
dealers, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On Rowland Street, a young man announces, ``I'm gonna cop,'' and
with money in his hand crosses to the corner where a couple loiter.
A block away, there is a lot of furtive activity around a pay phone
on the corner. Down the street, a high-stakes craps game continues
in one driveway. Residents complain that illegal car-repair joints
sprout on the bigger streets.
</P>
<P>
   And on almost every block, like a bruise, is an unkempt house
with a sagging porch, a trash-filled yard, a pile of old dumped
tires, or broken windows partly boarded up.
</P>
<P>
   There have been some shootings and stabbings, said Richard
Puchalski, who as executive director of Syracuse United Neighbors
seems to know every block of Skunk City. ``A lot of folks who have
lived here 40 or 50 or 60 years are finding it difficult to
maintain their houses,'' he said. ``They are being pressured by
their siblings, who say, `You'd better get the hell out of
there.'''
</P>
<P>
   Even in its heyday, Skunk City was not the fanciest part of
town. It was too close to the swamp; developers crammed as many
houses as possible in narrow lots along the new sewer line. In more
recent decades, the threat of a highway project discouraged people
from moving in.
</P>
<P>
   But to the people who lived there, it was a ``garden spot of
Eden,'' according to the yellowing newspaper clippings preserved at
the Onondaga Historical Association. For the children, there was
fishing and skating and swimming; for the adults, there were plenty
of saloons and a movie house.
</P>
<P>
   The men in the neighborhood had steady jobs at the post office,
the railroad or the auto plants. Some were more colorful: Florence
Joslin's father sang on the radio, while the Schwald boys' dad had
been a roller skater in a vaudeville act, the Whirling Hamilton
Trio, before he settled down to raise a family.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were kids, 15, 16 years old, our father could leave
the car in the driveway with the keys in it,'' said Dennis J.
Schwald Sr., 58. ``Nobody touched nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Back then, said his brother William, 61, ``everyone owned their
own home.'' He added, ``We've seen it gone down and down.'' Both
men, who retired from the Carrier air-conditioner plant, still live
on Hartson Street, as did their parents and in-laws; now, Dennis'
son owns two houses on the street.
</P>
<P>
   But such roots have gone out of fashion, even in Syracuse.
Today, many young families _ and older ones, too _ prefer to live
out in the suburbs, where the houses are newer, the lots bigger and
the schools better. The amount of developed land around the city
has almost doubled in the last decade, said Vito Sciscioli, the
city's commissioner for community and economic development.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the region's population has been shrinking, with most
of the drain coming from within the city limits. From 1990 to
mid-1999, the population of Onondaga County shrank by 13,000, with
12,000 of the drop occurring in Syracuse, according to federal
census estimates.
</P>
<P>
   That left Syracuse with ``a brutal oversupply of housing,'' said
Eric Hangen, who wrote the report for the Syracuse Neighborhood
Initiative. People who wanted to sell could not. People who wanted
to fix up their homes would not because they feared rightly that
they could not recoup their investments, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate homeowners took to renting out their unwanted houses,
or selling them to slum lords, or abandoning them altogether
because they could not pay the mortgages. Or the taxes, especially
after the city started seizing delinquent properties a couple of
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development alone now lists
about 50 houses for sale in the city. Some of them are priced at
less than $15,000, which is roughly what it would cost to knock
them down.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, the Syracuse Model Neighborhood Corp., a housing
group, built houses on vacant lots and sold them for $78,000, but
no more.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last two years I've built one house,'' said Thomas
Francis, who runs the group. ``There's no demand, and I can't
afford to hold on to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Fundamentally, Francis said, ``there just are not enough
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ergo, demolition _ or de-densifying, as some people call it. The
idea is to tear down not only those abandoned houses that threaten
to collapse on their own, but also those that are simply unneeded
and uneconomical. The land could be split between the remaining
nearby houses, to give them bigger yards, or driveways, or garages
(popular in snowy Syracuse). Big tracts could be turned into parks.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, in other words, is to make the city more like the
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suburbs are the best part of America,'' said Greg G.
Smith, a landlord with 60 units on the west side of the city.
``Everybody loves having a decent-size yard and off-street parking.
They want breathing room enough that when somebody's alarm clock
goes off, it doesn't wake you up.''
</P>
<P>
   If the houses that get knocked down are simply replaced, he
added, ``you're preserving the streetscape that everybody hates.''
As part of the neighborhood initiative, he is hoping to get
financing for a master plan and small grants to try out this idea
on the west side of town.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how much housing will be demolished in Syracuse remains
unclear. Each of the city's neighborhoods gets to make
recommendations about what improvements it would like. In some of
the more prosperous areas, residents are calling for improvements
like period streetlights or a new botanical garden.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said that no more than a third of the federal money, $5
million so far, could be used for demolition; at $12,000 a pop, the
city's estimate, that would be about 417 houses.
</P>
<P>
   No one is suggesting that demolition will solve all the problems
in Syracuse's neighborhoods. ``It's good to have that strategy,''
said Sciscioli, the city commissioner, ``but if you don't address
basic services, you can kiss it all goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in Skunk City, however, longtime residents like Patricia D.
Masters are looking forward to some demolition. ``I'd like to see
them do it a little quicker,'' she said. ``How long do you have to
have a dead house on your street?''

 &HT;    DOT-COM SCENE INVADES GOP CONVENTION
 &HT;    With INTERNET-GRID. For release Sunday, July 30.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ At the 2000 Republican National Convention, which
opens here Monday, the Old Guard is being forced to give ground to
the Young Turks.
</P>
<P>
   But this changeover isn't political. It's media-driven.
</P>
<P>
   As workers attached the last of 150,000 red, white and blue
balloons to the convention hall rafters, both the old-line major TV
networks and their all-news cable cousins were being obliged to
make room for some dot-com-pany.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, two all-Internet Webcasting services,
America Online and Psuedo.com, will join the familiar media logos
in the plush sky boxes high above the First Union Center.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of other Webcasters are primed to get into the political
news business as well. These pioneering cyberspace crews are being
grouped together in a huge white air-conditioned media tent known
as Internet Alley.
</P>
<P>
   At week's end, all that could be seen of their convention bid
was a maze of fiber optic cables _ some 6,600 miles have been
installed to serve the site _ and many Internet servers still in
their packing crates.
</P>
<P>
   Some 50 yards away, a squad of Japanese-speaking technicians was
testing high-definition television (HDTV) equipment, installed in
two graffiti-covered trucks driven here from New York.
</P>
<P>
   In a deal with convention organizers, the Tokyo-based NHK
network will be the only broadcaster to cover the proceedings,
gavel to gavel, in HDTV. Internet users with a broadband connection
will be able to watch the NHK feed on their computer monitors by
calling up the official GOP convention site.
</P>
<P>
   A slew of start-up Webcasting domains will also offer the kind
of political fare that until recently remained the exclusive domain
of the all-news cable outfits and network broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a different kind of convention for a different kind of
Republican,'' said top convention planner Tim Fitzpatrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``The GOP was last in Philly in 1948, and that was the first
convention ever to be televised,'' he noted. ``We will be just as
forward-thinking. Because of the Internet, everyone can join in.
Everyone has access.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, whatever ``news'' emerges out of Philadelphia this
week, will be sliced and diced in more ways than the
record-breaking four-ton hoagie sandwich that will be paraded
around City Hall on Monday before it is served.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone by the pure ``netcasters,'' such broadcasting
and cable outlets as ABC, CNN, C-SPAN, Fox News and MSNBC are also
planning to put much of their coverage on line, either in real-time
or in archival form.
</P>
<P>
   AOL, which has become even more content-aware as a result of its
pending merger with Time-Warner, is making a major bid here to snag
as many of its 22 million subscribers as possible.
</P>
<P>
   It will offer nightly interactive chats with newsmakers on
topics to be determined by online polls taken during the day. In
addition, it plans to deploy a 24-hour Webcam and to post selected
``delegate diaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet another all-Internet service, Voter.com, will host a nightly
show with its executive editor, onetime Watergate sleuth Carl
Bernstein. Also on tap: veteran political pundit Jack Germond and
Comedy's Central's Ben Stein.
</P>
<P>
   Not be left behind in the audio-video propwash, such online
``magazines'' as Salon.com and Slate.com will expand their daily
political coverage, offering a faster news turnaround to readers
than traditional print outlets usually offer.
</P>
<P>
   Internet users who may feel somewhat overwhelmed by the hundreds
of possible ways that they can access the 2000 Republican National
Convention might want to turn to such search engines as Yahoo's
events.yahoo.com or Alta Vista's www.icast.com.
</P>
<P>
   Both sites, among such others as Google.com, will offer
clickable links to what's on tap this week on the political scene.

INSURANCE COMPANIES REPORT BETTER EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Good earnings reports for some of the biggest names in U.S.
commercial insurance this week suggested that long-depressed prices
for coverage were beginning to rise. And that caught the attention
of investors.
</P>
<P>
   Share prices rose sharply for American International Group, the
biggest and strongest of the group, as well as for Chubb Corp.; St.
Paul Cos.; Marsh &AMP; McLennan Cos., the world's largest insurance
brokerage; and Hartford Financial Services Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prospects are clearly improving,'' said Weston Hicks, an
analyst at J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Marsh &AMP; McLennan Cos. reported a 17 percent rise in operating
earnings, to $506 million, for the second quarter. American
International Group, widely known as AIG, posted an increase of 13
percent, to $1.43 billion. Hartford Financial Services also
reported an increase of 13 percent, to $239 million.
</P>
<P>
   Chubb Group reported a 10.5 percent rise in operating income, to
$180.7 million, but its per-share earnings remained flat at $1,
reflecting an issue of stock for the recent purchase of Executive
Risk, a company specializing in liability coverage for company
executives and board members.
</P>
<P>
   But Chubb reported improvements in profits in its commercial
lines, as did St. Paul Cos., which reported a 9 percent decline in
operating income, to $158.9 million. At Hartford Group, earnings
from life insurance offset heavy property-casualty claims. But the
company reported a 7 percent increase in worldwide property
casualty premiums, to $1.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is so excited because it is seeing things happening
that are going to lead to better results in the future,'' Hicks
said.
</P>
<P>
   The stocks had extra spring in them, he said, because in terms
of revenue and net assets, they have been trading at extremely low
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice R. Greenberg, the chief executive of AIG, which operates
in more than 130 countries, said that in his company's domestic
business ``there is an increasingly better tone to the commercial
property-casualty market as rates continue to firm.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Frank, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, noted that
several of the property-casualty companies had negotiated higher
prices with customers. Frank upgraded his rating on St. Paul Cos.
from neutral to buy and increased his price targets for St. Paul as
well as AIG and Chubb.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing the commercial insurance market improving
virtually across the board,'' Frank said.

 &HT;    VETERANS' BILLBOARDS WARN RECRUITS: DON'T JOIN
 &HT;    (Photo slugged Billboards on Cox server. For questions, call
Skip Peterson, Dayton Daily News, 937-225-2230)
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Billboards urging military recruits to ``think
again'' before considering military careers has touched off a
debate among veterans over whether the signs amount to disloyalty
to the country many spent their careers defending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thinking about a military career? Think again!'' warns a
billboard being distributed by the National Veterans Organization
of America of El Paso, Texas. The billboard shows the traditional
drawing of ``Uncle Sam'' above the words, ``I lied to you about
veterans' benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Even critics of the sign say they agree with the complaint
behind it _ that they were promised lifetime health care, which
Congress now refuses to fund.
</P>
<P>
   But some say the billboard crosses a line between protest and
disloyalty. Many of these veterans have contributed to a different
campaign, which distributes billboards saying simply: ``Military
Retirees Fought for Freedom. Now Congress Denies Earned Healthcare.
Call your congressman.''
</P>
<P>
   A Defense Department spokesman said Friday the department is
concerned about the impact both billboards will have on recruiting
in an already ``difficult recruiting market.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the spokesman added that the armed services appear
likely to meet their recruiting quotas this year.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the billboard war is an issue that has provoked a federal
court fight, protest rallies in several cities, a lobbying war in
Congress and growing frustration among many men and women who made
careers of military service.
</P>
<P>
   Military retirees _ and even Secretary of Defense William Cohen
_ say that decades ago recruiters routinely promised lifetime
health care at no cost in return for careers in the Army, Navy, Air
Force, Marines and Coast Guard. However, the Defense Department
contends that the promises did not amount to binding government
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, retirees are required to sign up for Tricare, the
Defense Department's health care plan for active duty dependents
and retirees, and pay a portion of the costs of their care. When
they become eligible for Medicare, they are dropped from Tricare's
roles altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep the promise'' bills have been stalled in Congress,
primarily because of opposition from Senate Republican Leader Trent
Lott of Mississippi and Senate Armed Services Committee chairman
John Warner, R-Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our calls are running about 250-to-one in favor of these
billboards,'' said Douglas McArthur(cq), executive director of the
National Veterans Organization of America, which has distributed
the ``think again'' billboards. ``And we've had thousands of
calls.''
</P>
<P>
   The group's billboards have spread from Texas into neighboring
states. One appeared last week in Panama City, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Navy Cmdr. Joseph Priestley of Panama City, who in May
organized a small ``muster'' of military retirees here to protest
lack of congressional action on the issue, said he contributed to
putting up the sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other sign asks people to call their congressman. That's
what we've been asking them to do for the last 18 months, and I
couldn't swear to you that a single person ever did,'' Priestley
said. ``Trent Lott is putting the screws to us and we need
something that will get results.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Floyd Felts, a retired Army sergeant major from Evans,
Ga., said the sign ``goes after recruiting, and I am not in favor
of that. Let's get after the Congress, as they can fix this. The
active military are, and will always be, our friends and
comrades-in-arms.''
</P>
<P>
   Felts and retired Air Force Major Gen. Sidney S. Novaresi of
Fair Oaks, Calif., both said they have contributed to the
``Military Retirees Legislative Fund,'' a Comanche, Okla., group
that is promoting the ``Call your congressman'' billboards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very concerned about this retiree health care issue,''
said Novaresi, ``because they (the Defense Department) made a liar
out of me. When I was on active duty, I called people in and
counselled them to remain in the military and I promised them
health care for life if they stayed in.
</P>
<P>
   ``But urging people not to enlist is tantamount to treason,
because you are degrading the ability of the country to maintain an
adequate defense,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 members of the House of Representatives have
signed a bill to provide retirees who joined the military prior to
1956 free health care coverage under the Federal Employees Health
Benefits Plan, the plan covering civilian government employees,
retirees and members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Military retirees who joined after 1956 would be allowed to
purchase health care under the federal employees plan at the same
rates as retired civilian employees.
</P>
<P>
   A companion bill, introduced by Sens. Tim Johnson, D-S.D., John
McCain, R-Ariz., and the late Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., is opposed by
Warner and Lott, who has blocked consideration by the full Senate.

TRILLING'S BALANCING ACT: MORAL INSIGHTS THAT STILL HAVE POWER 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   How quaint the literary criticism of Lionel Trilling can seem,
now that successive waves of structuralism, deconstruction,
cultural studies, postcolonialism and other literary technologies
have transformed university departments of literature. It has been
a quarter-century since Trilling died, and more than a half century
since he published ``The Liberal Imagination,'' his first
collection of essays _ and most important book. Who now would think
to write essays called ``Art and Neurosis'' or ``Manners, Morals
and the Novel'' _ except to question whether the words ``art,''
``neurosis,'' ``manners,'' ``morals'' or ''novel'' have any
permanent meaning?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in the 1940s, when Trilling first became a prominent
intellectual as an English professor at Columbia University, the
most fashionable approach to literature was known as New Criticism.
It boasted an abstract, furiously modern vision: each literary work
could be analyzed without reference to the author, his life or
time. Criticism was to become a science. Trilling insisted on just
the opposite. Criticism, like literature, had to engage with the
full mess of human life, most notably the customs and beliefs we
call ``politics.'' He got more than he bargained for: politics can
now seem to be a main point of literary studies.
</P>
<P>
   In a new collection of essays about Trilling _ ``Lionel Trilling
and the Critics: Opposing Selves'' _ even the editor, John Rodden,
acknowledges that for many contemporary readers Trilling may seem
``little more than a curiosity of literary history, a period
piece.'' His prose style can only accentuate the impression of
things long past: it is almost baroque in its winding, hesitating,
qualifying, venturing gestures. The words ``variety,''
``difficulty,'' ``modulation,'' ``complexity'' abound. Each phrase
is limpid, but the arguments themselves are tentative, often
ambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   So faded has his intellectual aura become that it provides no
immunity from the recent biographical accounts by members of his
family. His widow, Diana Trilling, in her 1993 memoir, ``The
Beginning of the Journey,'' recalled his anguished depressions,
petty squabbles and nasty outbursts. In the journal The American
Scholar, his son, James Trilling, recently suggested that his
father's behavior and intellectual style were consistent with a
psychological diagnosis of attention deficit disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Rodden's anthology reminds a reader that Trilling was
complicated enough to be hailed by such disparate figures as Edmund
Wilson and Irving Kristol. A second, more significant, new
anthology, ``The Moral Obligation to Be Intelligent,'' edited by
Leon Wieseltier, shows just how much is at stake. It is the most
capacious and pungent single volume of Trilling's work ever
published, with writings spanning his entire career: classic essays
on the Kinsey Report, on Wordsworth, on Jane Austen and on Kipling.
It also includes Trilling's magisterial discussion of Henry James'
novel ``The Princess Casamassima.''
</P>
<P>
   What gives these pieces enduring importance is not Trilling's
judgment that the Kinsey Report fetishizes science or that Kipling
gave nationalism a bad name. The essays' subjects really were
occasions for Trilling to brood on much larger themes that, far
from being dated or quaint, have lost none of their urgency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Liberal Imagination,'' for example, was partly a critical
response to the Stalinism that tinged the era's liberalism. But in
the book's influential preface Trilling uncovered deeper tensions
within liberalism itself. One of the great achievements of modern
times, he suggested, was the liberal conception of humanity: the
view that there were universal and inalienable human rights, and
that the powers of reason could both honor those rights and
eradicate the world's evils.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Trilling went on, was that liberalism, in its
search for freedom and justice, had to exert power; it required
legislation and organization. Stalinism was an extreme
oversimplification of liberalism, one in which the social
engineering was ruthless. But even democratic liberalism, Trilling
believed, exhibited a simplified view, an unwavering conviction
about how the world might be regulated. Since these qualities of
simplification and certainty were themselves illiberal, the
enlargement of freedom risked producing a contraction of freedom.
``Some paradox of our natures,'' Trilling wrote, ``leads us, when
once we have made our fellow men the objects of our enlightened
interest, to go on to make them the objects of our pity, then of
our wisdom, ultimately of our coercion.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The impact on the mind could be even more baleful. The ambition
of rationally reforming society tended to minimize the importance
of the inner life, shrinking the conception of the mind. All dark
desires, untamable impulses, ambivalent feelings and contradictory
thoughts would then be considered failures of the outside world,
imperfections in the social order that could be controlled or
legislated away. In this way, liberalism risked evolving into
doctrinaire puritanism _ or worse.
</P>
<P>
   Such was liberalism's great temptation, in Trilling's view (a
view he shared with Isaiah Berlin). ``Life presses us so hard,'' he
wrote, ``time is so short, the suffering of the world is so huge,
simple, unendurable _ anything that complicates our moral fervor in
dealing with reality as we immediately see it and wish to drive
headlong upon it must be regarded with some impatience.'' And while
liberalism was, in its adversary position toward the world, a
transforming force, it was also, in its adversary position toward
the mind, a limiting force.
</P>
<P>
   This is where literature came in. Trilling suggested that the
variousness of literature could help shape the liberal imagination,
that it could temper impatient liberal objectives with reminders of
the complexities of the inner life and encourage a ``moral
realism'' that could soften the demands of ``moral righteousness.''
Literature would not serve the adversary culture; it would humanize
it.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this extended skepticism about liberalism, Trilling
was often attacked by liberals for being a conservative and
attacked by conservatives for not being sufficiently forthright.
During the 1960s, for example, he grimly but cautiously criticized
the counterculture for turning liberalism's adversary position into
sweeping orthodoxies. His arguments for rejecting the simple
formulations of radical liberalism did indeed have conservative
implications, emphasizing limits more than possibilities. But
Trilling would also have objected to the conservative impulse to
simplify the relationships he perceived. Who in the midst of such
complexity could afford the certainty of self-righteousness, let
alone a declaration of allegiance? Complexity was Trilling's
prescription for all political positions; ambiguity was the
solution. Moral realism is a balancing act.
</P>
<P>
   The sociologist Richard Sennett once accused Trilling of
refusing to take a stand during the tumult of the 1960s and the
crises at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no position,'' Sennett declared. ``You are always in
between.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Between,'' Trilling replied, ``is the only honest place to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   However honest, though, it does not make things easy. In
Trilling's brilliant examination of ``The Princess Casamassima,''
the hero, Hyacinth, poor and ill-educated, is drawn to two
different worlds _ one of political radicalism in which great
personal sacrifice is required in the name of moral good, the other
of aesthetic refinement in which the greatest achievements of
Europe are presented for his delectation. He realizes that there is
no separating the inequities from the great works, but then how can
he be true both to his radicalism and to his aesthetic perceptions?
The novel's greatness, in Trilling's view, comes from its refusal
to answer the question clearly; the tension is potentially tragic.
Trilling saw Hyacinth as a version of Henry James, but he may have
also seen him as a reflection of himself, desperately trying to
stake out a ``between.''
</P>
<P>
   This is one reason that reading Trilling remains so unsettling.
He provides no firm place to stand. Despite his powerful analysis
of liberalism, his emphasis on complexity often becomes too
sweeping a response to every belief. It is partly a retreat from
the world, a declaration of its untenable tensions. But his
portrait of the American democratic mind, imperially pious one
minute, queasily unsteady the next, illiberally making demands in
the name of virtue and liberally tolerating virtue's ambiguities,
celebrating reason while distrusting its demands _ this mind
remains as current now as it was then. It is as familiar and as
strange as Trilling's prose.

 &HT;    GRASSLEY SEES NEW STUDY ON NURSING HOMES, SAME 'HORROR STORIES'
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The findings are chillingly familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a long time to feed these residents,'' says one
nursing home aide. ``But we don't have a long time. Often they
don't finish their meal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Baths, ice water don't get given out,'' says another nursing
assistant, adding that ``a whole lot doesn't get done.''
</P>
<P>
   A third worker says, ``Why would you want to live longer if this
is how it ends up?''
</P>
<P>
   The comments, included in a new federal study on the effects of
understaffing in the nation's nursing homes, paint a picture of
neglect that has frustrated Sen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa,
chairman of the Select Committee on Aging.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wonder if the nursing home industry and the bureaucracy of
the state and federal government will ever get it right,'' Grassley
said in an interview Friday, one day after his panel publicly
released the draft findings of the latest federal report.
</P>
<P>
   The study concludes that 54 percent of nursing homes have
staffing levels so low that residents are put in serious jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   In Grassley's view, those findings are little different from a
congressional investigation that made headlines two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as then, he said, ``Most of the problems are the lack of
elementary care in three categories: not getting enough food into
the system so there's malnutrition, not enough water, so there's
dehydration and not turning often enough, and they get bedsores.''
</P>
<P>
   Grassley, who took over the select committee on aging
chairmanship just three years ago, said he has found similar horror
stories in studies going back to the 1960s. Yet, widespread
problems continue with little attention, except when the issue
becomes an occasional political theme, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the latest report was almost forgotten, he observed.
Congress had ordered the Health and Human Services Department ten
years ago to complete a study on staffing at nursing homes by 1992.
Grassley's committee discovered in 1998 that the work had never
been done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's blame to go around,'' said Grassley, who said
Congress failed to follow up on its request, even as both the Bush
and Clinton administrations failed to act.
</P>
<P>
   Even now the report is only partially done, since it does not
yet include recommendations on whether the federal government
should set minimum staffing levels, long a controversial subject
within the nursing home industry.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley said that he has not decided to push for absolute
minimums. However, he said he is determined to require some
accountability for nursing homes before Congress votes, as
expected, to increase their funding by $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the federal government pays about $39 billion for
services in the nation's 16,500 nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Grassley argued that the Clinton administration
already has the power to set staffing standards under current law.
``I think it gives them the authority to do more than they're
doing,'' Grassley said.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy-Ann DeParle, head of the federal Health Care Financing
Administration, which oversees nursing homes, publicly questioned
that notion this week. She told Grassley Thursday that she would
consult with her legal counsel and get back to him.
</P>
<P>
   Whether she accepts his challenge or not, Grassley said that
more than government action is needed to deal with neglect and
abuse in nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's going to get fixed by regulation and by
more money and even a new ethic within the industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what's going to really enhance the quality of care in
the nursing homes is when, in communities where nursing homes are
located, social-minded people who aren't even relatives of people
in the nursing homes start taking an interest'' by visiting them
and checking on conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like Hillary Clinton's philosophy about a village
raising kids,'' Grassley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But let me tell you, I sure think it takes a village to make
sure you've got quality care in nursing homes.''

   GOP-OUTLOOK-REVIEW (Philadelphia) _ There are three things you

true-blue conservative icon on center stage. Any utterance of the
word ``abortion.'' The standard savaging of the opposition. It is
only fitting that Republicans are somewhat sheepish about taking on

   MIDEAST-SUMMIT-REVIEW (Undated) _ The dirty little secret of the
``high stakes'' Camp David peace summit is that ``the brink'' was a
myth. No explosion in Israel or the Palestinian territories
occurred when the talks collapsed, nor is chaos expected any time
soon. This is because not only was ``the brink'' a myth, so were
the descriptions of what lay on the other side. It was never
failure of the summit that brought with it the risk of violence. It

<P>
   AIRCRASHES-TECH-REVIEW (Washington) _ Two air disasters
involving symbols of national pride _ the Concorde in 2000 and the
Hindenburg in 1937 _ are instructive about the difficulties of
predicting technological progress. It remains to be seen whether
the Concorde accident will kill the supersonic transports the way
the Hindenburg ended the promise of the dirigible. But progress _
including, perhaps, progress in safety _ has bypassed both. By

   CONVICTION-REVERSALS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Newly discovered
evidence may seem like a convict's dream come true, but the reality
of American courts is that such evidence rarely makes a difference.
Once a jury has reached a verdict or a judge has ruled, lawyers
say, the odds are overwhelmingly against reopening a case, no

   DR-LAURA-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Dr. Laura Schlessinger, the

commentary about the good doctor.

<P>
   YOUNGADULT-BOOKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Since the 1970s, young-adult
novels have featured a parade of America's dysfunctional. And early
on, there was great hue and cry about Judy Blume's books, with
their frank discussion of sex, and Robert Cormier's books, which
dropped the happy ending. But just in the last four years,
young-adult fiction has moved into ever bleaker territory. By Tamar
Lewin.

predicting technological progress. It remains to be seen whether
the Concorde accident will kill the supersonic transports the way
the Hindenburg ended the promise of the dirigible. But progress _
including, perhaps, progress in safety _ has bypassed both. By

   CONVICTION-REVERSALS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Newly discovered
evidence may seem like a convict's dream come true, but the reality
of American courts is that such evidence rarely makes a difference.
Once a jury has reached a verdict or a judge has ruled, lawyers
say, the odds are overwhelmingly against reopening a case, no
matter how compelling the new information might seem. By Jane
Fritsch.

   DR-LAURA-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Dr. Laura Schlessinger, the

DAVIS, GRIMES FIGURE IN PATRIOTS PLANS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ They've shared a number since camp began and
that's not the best sign for anyone trying to make a roster.
</P>
<P>
   They are listed at the same size _ 6 feet 4 inches and 300
pounds. They are in the same category _ rookie free agents looking
for jobs on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Friday afternoon, however, they finally got numbers to call
their own.
</P>
<P>
   And one other thing: Because of injuries, they have received
much more time than might be expected _ having lined up with
starting units _ and should see a fair amount of action Monday
night in the exhibition opener against San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly wearing No. 74 in the white is Adam Davis, an offensive
guard out of Oklahoma State. Davis has since been assigned No. 61.
And No. 74 in the blue, Reggie Grimes, is a defensive end from
Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, while injuries have opened doors for them here,
injuries and circumstances slowed them at times in college.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was starting as a redshirt freshman when he broke his leg.
He blew his knee out late in his junior year, and last year twice
needed his knee scoped.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people were afraid he was not going to get a chance
to play as a senior and he fought back from that, too,'' said
Richard Wilson, an offensive assistant who works with receivers at
Oklahoma State. ``He played injured and banged up a lot and what I
remember most is when he was healthy he was outstanding. It was a
lot to his credit that he played when (he was) hurt also. I think
he was banged up his whole senior year and he didn't have the
mobility he had before.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Davis started all but one game last year.
</P>
<P>
   Patriot linebacker coach Ron Ryan _ son of Buddy _ was defensive
coordinator at Oklahoma State the last three years and passed on
word of Davis's work habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a good feel for the player in terms of toughness and his
competitiveness and being the type of player we want on the
offensive line,'' coach Bill Belichick said. ``He's come in and
really worked hard. He's gotten a lot of opportunity because of the
injuries, and he's really done a good job of taking advantage of
those.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Davis was trying to fend off a fired-up Willie McGinest
near the end of the morning practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a step up from what you're used to,'' Davis said. ``He
comes a lot faster than they come in college and he's a lot
stronger than they were in college. That's part of the game. He was
at my place one time when he was a rookie. Everybody's got to go
through it. I'm just trying to learn right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditto Grimes.
</P>
<P>
   Grimes was not a full-time starter at Alabama but was a valuable
and versatile backup, hurt by numbers as the Crimson Tide brought
in guys at his position who would be first- and second-round draft
picks.
</P>
<P>
   He finished strong, starting the last three games last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did an outstanding job and brought a lot of character and
leadership,'' said Alabama defensive coordinator Ellis Johnson.
``He was impressive. We're going to miss him as much as a starter.
His No. 1 strength is intelligence. He was always very consistent.
And he has good speed for a player up front.''
</P>
<P>
   Grimes caught the eye of the Patriots when they were looking at
Cornelius Griffin.
</P>
<P>
   Grimes liked what he saw of the numbers in New England and
rejected a couple of other offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel like I'd be used as a camp body, so to speak,''
Grimes said. ``They have you come in and use you up and cut you. I
felt like I could really come in and compete for playing time.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, it's been a great fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He picks things up pretty quickly,'' Belichick said. ``He
takes coaching well. He's been improving every day . . . I think
our style of play fits him better than what they asked him to do in
college.''
</P>
<P>
   In the big picture, Davis and Grimes are trying to beat the odds
and make the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   And in the uniform number game?
</P>
<P>
   Grimes, a fullback in high school, wore No. 98 in college, and
for now he gets to keep No. 74.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, a tight end when he got to Oklahoma State, wore No. 78.
But he's not picky.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can give me No. 2 as long as I'm on the team,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That was at lunch. By the 3 p.m. practice, he had on his new No.
61, the number long snapper Thad Sheldon, who was waived Friday,
had been wearing.
</P>
<P>
   No. 61 will do, too.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks tumbled Friday as a report of unexpectedly
strong economic growth increased the threat of another Federal
Reserve Board interest-rate rise.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index plunged 4.7 percent Friday, finishing
the week off 10.5 percent, its third-worst week ever. Its
technology stocks have been under pressure for over a week because
of concerns about weaker corporate earnings in the second half of
the year. And that concern has begun to spread, adding to the
selling pressure on Friday. The Dow Jones industrial average fell
0.7 percent Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But interest rates rose only slightly, probably because
inflation remained in check despite the strong second-quarter
growth.
</P>
<P>
   A strong economy is usually positive for stocks, because growth
is good for corporate earnings. But at a time when the United
States' central bank has pledged to slow the economy's growth to a
noninflationary pace, the 5.2 percent second-quarter surge in the
gross domestic product that the Commerce Department reported Friday
was read as a negative.
</P>
<P>
   The jolt from the report was intensified by two factors. One was
the surprise. Most economists were expecting the economy to slow to
a pace of around 3.5 percent to 4 percent, from over 5 percent in
the first quarter. ``Signs of a slowing economy are hard to find in
this latest batch of numbers,'' said Donald J. Fine, chief market
analyst at Chase Asset Management.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many investors had begun to think that the Fed
might be finished with its interest-rate increases, after pushing
up its benchmark federal-funds rate six times, to 6.5 percent,
since June 1999. The chairman of the Fed, Alan Greenspan, may have
inadvertently reinforced this view when he outlined the reasons he
believed growth was slowing, when he testified before the Senate
Banking Committee July 20.
</P>
<P>
   But another rate increase is still not a certainty, some
analysts argued. This is because the data on Friday also reflected
several positive trends: a slowdown in consumer spending, contained
inflationary pressures and strong business investment that could
lead to even higher worker productivity.
</P>
<P>
   It has been the surprising increase in worker productivity in
the last several years that has allowed the economy, which is now
in its longest expansion on record, to grow briskly without a surge
in inflation. And Greenspan indicated in his recent testimony that
if these positive trends continued, a rate increase might be
avoided.
</P>
<P>
   So the path between now and the Fed's policy-making meeting Aug.
22 could be bumpy. The data for July, which will be released before
then _ including the figures for jobs, retail sales and consumer
inflation _ will likely determine what the Fed does, a point that
Greenspan made in his appearance before Congress on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the consumer looks like he is ramping up again, then that
is a threat,'' said James E. Glassman, senior U.S. economist at
Chase Manhattan Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Glassman thinks the pace of consumer spending is slowing, in
part because higher oil and gasoline prices are cutting into income
and in part because some big companies are worried about sales
slowing in the second half of the year. But Friday's data, along
with the June jump in existing-home sales and orders for durable
goods and the July increase in consumer confidence, do give him
pause. Even so, he is still not predicting a rate increase in
August.
</P>
<P>
   William Dudley, the chief U.S. economist at Goldman, Sachs,
thinks consumer spending has not slowed significantly. Instead, he
argues that the 3 percent growth in spending in the second quarter,
down from 7.7 percent in the first quarter, was just a pause. The
key for Fed policy makers and investors, he said, ``is why did the
consumer pull back in the second quarter and will it continue.''
</P>
<P>
   He expects another interest-rate increase in August. ``This idea
that the Fed is done with tightening is premature, because the
economy has more momentum than people think,'' Dudley said.
</P>
<P>
   Only a small rally in the last minutes of trading prevented all
three major stock indexes from ending at their lows for the day.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index fell 179.23 points, to 3,663.00, led
lower by Cisco Systems, JDS Uniphase and Intel. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index, which includes many of the same big
technology stocks that pulled down the Nasdaq, dropped 29.73
points, or 2.1 percent, to 1,419.89. The Dow, which has a lighter
load of technology stocks, dropped 74.96 points, to 10,511.17. The
Dow was led lower by declines in Intel, American Express and J.P.
Morgan &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   For the week, the Dow was down 2.1 percent, while the S&AMP;P was
off 4.1 percent. For the year, all three indexes are down, with the
Nasdaq off 10 percent, the Dow down 8.6 percent and the S&AMP;P
slipping 3.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Friday's selling, the stock of Corvis, a maker of
equipment for fiber-optic cables, more than doubled on its first
day of trading. The stock jumped 48 23/32, to 84 23/32, although
the company has yet to show any revenue.
</P>
<P>
   In the bond market, prices and yields were little changed, as
one measure of inflation in the gross domestic price data showed
price increases falling to a rate of 2.5 percent in the second
quarter from 3.3 percent in the first. The yield on the Treasury's
10-year note rose to 6.03 percent, from 6.00 percent on Thursday.
The note's price, which moves in the opposite direction from the
yield, fell 8/32, to 103 12/32.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The confusion among investors about what the Fed might do is
understandable because the central bank's job is not just to slow
the pace of economic growth. Instead, policy-makers want to slow
growth to a noninflationary pace. But as they are trying to do
this, the acceptable noninflationary speed limit for growth is
rising because of stronger worker productivity.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's speed limit has already jumped from around 2.5 percent
to 3.5 percent in the early 1990s to 3.5 percent to 4 percent now.
And who knows whether it will move higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are disoriented, it certainly makes sense,''
Glassman said. ``We are not used to this type of growth.''

   REPUBS-PRIMARIES (Philadelphia) _ Aides to George W. Bush
rallied opposition Friday to scuttle a plan that would overhaul the
presidential primary schedule by stretching the calendar and
letting small states vote first. Supporters of the plan promised to
seek a vote in the rules committee of the Republican National
Convention, but because the so-called ``Delaware plan'' already
faces substantial opposition from big-state delegates, its future
looked dim. By Adam Clymer.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-BIO-VI (Undated) _ Another installment in a series of
articles about the lives of the presidential candidates. This
article focuses on the personal changes that George W. Bush went
through in midlife. By Nicholas D. Kristof.
</P>
<P>
   With photos NYT13, NYT14.
</P>
<P>
   KAN-SCHOOLS-ELECT (Undated) _ Elections for the Kansas state
school board are usually quiet, low-key affairs. But the board's
decision to delete virtually any mention of evolution from the
science curriculum has made Tuesday's Republican primaries for four
of the 10 seats the hottest political contest in the state.
Democrats are even switching parties to vote next week. One
candidate has raised $90,000, previously unheard of for a board
election. By Pam Belluck.
</P>
<P>
   WASH-PA-CONGRESS (Seattle) _ A look at the two congressional
districts, one in Washington state and one in Pennsylvania, that
frequently swing back and forth between Republicans and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   With graphic and map.
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-CLINTON (Jerusalem) _ President Clinton, seeking to
shore up Prime Minister Ehud Barak's shaky political base, appeared
on Israel television Friday night to heap praise on Barak,
promising rewards for peace and even hinting that he was ready to
move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem. Such a move would be regarded
as a monumental triumph here, an achievement of Israel's cherished
dream of having Jerusalem recognized as its capital. By John
Kifner.
</P>
<P>
   CANADA-PASSAGE (Tuktoyaktuk, Northwest Territories) _ For four
centuries, explorers and shipping executives have dreamed of
sending ships from Europe to Asia across the top of North America.
The quest for an Arctic shortcut consumed hundreds of lives. Even
though successful passages were finally made, the route was written
off as impractical because its labyrinthine channels seemed to be
perpetually frozen. But now, as global temperatures rise, a
Northwest Passage no longer seems like a romantic pipedream. Some
Canadians, though, are afraid it could become a nightmare. By James
Brooke.
</P>
<P>
   With map.
</P>
<P>
   NY-KENNEDY-SECURITY (New York) _ In the attempted hijacking of a
National Airlines jet at Kennedy Airport Thursday night, how did a
man with a gun manage to get past airport security? By John
Sullivan and Randy Kennedy.

&HT;     NEWSPAPER INDUSTRY'S NORMAL PRACTICE VALIDATED BY RULING IN
CHRONICLE CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CHRISTIAN BERTHELSEN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ After nearly a year of close antitrust scrutiny
and allegations of anti-competitive behavior surrounding the Hearst
Corp.'s purchase of the San Francisco Chronicle, it comes to down
to this: U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker concluded that the way
the newspaper industry had handled the dissolution of joint
operating agreement between the Chronicle and the San Francisco
Examiner had been correct all along.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling found:
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers are not required to continue publishing separate
publications after dissolving agreements to share some operations.
</P>
<P>
   Parties in a joint operating agreement are free to merge as long
as one of them is failing.
</P>
<P>
   Participants in a JOA do not have to spin off assets for
purposes of establishing a competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merger of Hearst and (Chronicle Publishing Co.) coupled with
the closure of The Examiner would not create a monopoly,
substantially lessen competition or unreasonably restrain trade,''
Walker concluded in his 46-page decision Thursday. Thus ends a case
with more twists and turns than San Francisco's famed Lombard
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Never before had the owners of a failing newspaper felt
compelled to give the paper to new owners with a
multimillion-dollar subsidy to run it in order to take control of
the competition.
</P>
<P>
   And never before had two companies' decision to dissolve a joint
operating agreement gone to trial, even in cases where one
newspaper was creating an apparent monopoly in acquiring the other.
</P>
<P>
   Walker's ruling is the first to deal with the issue of
dissolving a joint operating agreement. Until now, media companies
have been free from aggressive Justice Department scrutiny or
public challenge in ending such agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge clearly has interpreted the law correctly,'' said
William Dean Singleton, the chief executive of MediaNews Group
Inc., of Denver, the publisher of the Denver Post and owner of the
Alameda Newspaper Group. ``That's the way it's been interpreted for
years. I guess if there's anything good out of this, federal judges
still interpret the law. Even in San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Ridder, the chief executive of Knight Ridder, publisher of
the San Jose Mercury News and 30 other newspapers, said scrutiny in
the San Francisco case could be attributed to the size of the
market compared with most cities where JOAs exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if it's Knoxville, Tennessee, or Evansville, Indiana,
or some place like that, it would tend, because of the much smaller
size, to get much less scrutiny,'' Ridder said. ``I think that in a
large market, you tend to get more scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   The Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970 created an exception to
federal antitrust law suspending financial competition between
newspapers when one paper suffers from dwindling readership and
revenues, to keep diverse editorial voices in the same community.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, the Chronicle and the Examiner combined business
operations, including printing, advertising and circulation, while
combining their revenue, sharing costs and splitting the remainder.
The agreement would have lapsed in 2005, but the two papers sought
to end it early. By splitting profits, the Chronicle was losing
money while the Examiner recently began earning money because the
Chronicle's news operation cost more to run than The Examiner's.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst sought to buy the Chronicle for $660 million and transfer
ownership of the Examiner to the Fang family of San Francisco,
while providing a $66 million subsidy. Clint Reilly, a former
mayoral candidate, filed suit claiming the deal would violate
antitrust laws and leave Hearst with an illegal monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   The irony was not lost on some observers: The joint operating
agreement was created as an exception to federal antitrust law, a
means of suspending the natural law of competition. Yet here were
two companies trying to end that exception, and being accused of
acting anti-competitively.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper executives, analysts, observers and others around the
nation have said in recent days they view the Examiner-Chronicle
case as little more than a product of San Francisco's peculiar
politics, an amusing and entertaining diversion with little bearing
on how their businesses would be affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what's wrong with the San Francisco litigation, it
makes no sense,'' Singleton said. ``It's a bunch of litigation
brought by people who don't understand the JOA rule, or the Justice
Department antitrust laws. I am surprised that the federal judge
didn't throw this lawsuit out on day one, because this lawsuit
assumes that eliminating editorial voice eliminates competition.
Competition was eliminated in 1965.''
</P>
<P>
   The operating agreements haven't proved to be long-term
solutions in most cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people's attitude is, this is something that newspapers
can do which may extend a separate editorial voice for a time,
although history has shown that it only does that for a while,''
said John Morton, an analyst and consultant on newspaper
transactions who had been retained by Hearst as a consultant in its
negotiations with the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Chronicle and Examiner, more than 20 newspapers
partnered in joint operating agreements before the passage of the
law, which were grandfathered in. Since 1970, seven more have been
added, and 14 have ended, with the invariable result that the
smaller paper died. In some cases, as in Chattanooga, the surviving
paper, the Times Free-Press, has combined news and business
operations but continues to run two separate editorial pages. In
other cases, as in Miami, one newspaper simply paid the other to
cease publication altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The notable exception is in Denver, where the E.W. Scripps Co.'s
Rocky Mountain News and Singleton's Post are proposing to enter a
joint operating agreement after decades of visceral competition.
The News declared itself a failing paper, and in its filing with
the Justice Department said it had had $123 million in operating
losses over 10 years, despite an investment of $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   But San Francisco is not the only city to draw close scrutiny in
the dissolution of its JOA. In Hawaii, the state attorney general
required the Honolulu Star-Bulletin to continue publishing and seek
a buyer, after the paper initially agreed to stop publishing in
exchange for a financial payment from the Gannett-owned Advertiser.
But the only other instance where antitrust concerns were raised
was in St. Louis in 1983, when the early termination of a JOA and
closure was suspended while the Justice Department antitrust
division required that the closing paper be shopped for 15 days. A
buyer published the paper for two years before closing it forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is going have particularly wide impact,''
said Morton, the analyst. ``It just means that if partners in a JOA
have good cause to dissolve it, because one paper has become as
serious drag on earnings, as in the past, it's going to happen. . .
. All it does is confirm that generally, when the parties don't
want to publish two newspapers anymore, they don't end up having
to.''

 &HT;    Home Depot tests, gets good people
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Home Depot has the basics of its gung-ho culture down
to a science.
</P>
<P>
   Founders Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank built the company on
knocking the customer's socks off with service and low prices. Now,
they're banking on a computerized box to find employees who'll
measure up.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next three years, the home improvement giant intends to
do again what it took the last 20 years to accomplish: Home Depot
plans to open about 900 stores, and it will have to hire more than
200,000 workers to do that. Currently, new stores open on the
average of one every 43 hours.
</P>
<P>
   No problem, recruiters say.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to new job kiosks at every store, the hiring process is
smoother than ever. Every applicant has to take Home Depot's
computerized employment test, and it has resulted in better
employees, according to retailer. By the time a store manager
interviews an applicant for a job, the candidate has survived a
battery of questions about scruples and work habits.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot says its kiosks screen out potential problems and
find workers who will take to its frenzied retail atmosphere. Sure,
Big Orange wants to know if you've ever stolen from your employer,
or if you've recently been in a fistfight on the job. But what
managers are really excited about is a computerized test that
gauges how customer-savvy applicants are. In 70 or so questions,
Home Depot says it gets a good inkling whether the candidate would
make a good employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our managers say they're noticing a big difference in the
quality of people they're hiring,'' said Al Frost, director of
management development.
</P>
<P>
   The kiosks, which cost $10 million to install at the retailer's
1,000 stores around the country, have been a boon to human
resources, said Frost, who began developing the system four and a
half years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Frost, an industrial psychologist, wanted a way to find
industrious workers who would fit in with the long hours and
feverish work ethic at Home Depot. The best way, he said, was to
find the company's best sales persons and build a test around them.
</P>
<P>
   Store managers and supervisors studied nearly 500 employees on
the job. Then the employees were quizzed with an early version of
the employment test to see how their performance evaluations
correlated to their answers about customer service,
conscientiousness and overall work ethics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who passed the test knew more about products, took more
initiative, and were more dependable,'' Frost said. ``They rated 14
percent better on overall performance, which is a huge number. If
you can make a 14 percent improvement in someone's productivity,
that's a big impact on the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   But before applicants take the test, they get a feel for what
it's like to work in Home Depot's noisy warehouse stores. Each
kiosk shows a seven-minute video of real life on the job.
</P>
<P>
   With forklifts beeping in the background, a 30-something woman
in an orange apron warns, ``There are no quiet little cubicles
around here. Our warehouse environment is hectic. ... You are
literally on your feet all day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of the video is that we don't want applicants being
surprised,'' Frost said. ``They need to know that their feet may
hurt because they're working on concrete floors, or that it's
visually distracting because there are so many customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a high turnover rate (before the kiosk program) because
people were shocked once they started working,'' he said. ``We want
to tell people it's a great company and a great opportunity, but
it's a tough job.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, turnover has dropped more than 11 percent, Frost
said.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot's financial success, stock history and corporate lore
of lowly employees-turned-millionaires has given the retailer an
edge in recruiting. While some retailers have held back on growth
plans because they can't find enough workers, Home Depot's main
concern is picking the best employees out of the thousands that it
turns away, Frost said.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot gets an average of 1,000 to 1,500 applicants when it
opens a store, said David Hauck, a manager of information systems.
Each store employs about 250 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``With good advertising, we've gotten as many as 10,000
applications for a single store,'' Frost said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the kiosks are networked to a central database,
applications can be shared with all stores within a market. When
good candidates apply at a store that's not hiring, managers from
other stores in the area will contact them and ask if they're
willing to commute, Frost said.
</P>
<P>
   That's part of the reason Home Depot isn't having a problem
keeping its 34 stores staffed in its hometown, said spokesman Don
Harrison. Metro Atlanta's base of stores gives it an edge over
newer markets that may have only one or two stores, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   In the total chain, nearly 850,000 people have applied since
Home Depot began installing kiosks in early 1998. The retailer
hired about 106,000 of that pool.
</P>
<P>
   There are pockets of the country, such as Minnesota, that are
tough because of extremely low unemployment rates, Frost said. But
a new national recruiting campaign, which includes the retailer's
first ``help wanted'' ad on TV, has doubled and sometimes
quadrupled the number of applicants, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the kiosks, we have a quantitative way to track the
number of applicants because we know exactly when and where they
applied,'' Frost said.

 &HT;    Marcus still charming the masses with the message of Home Depot
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At a recent parking lot powwow, the buzz is building
as a throng of Home Depot employees rub elbows on the asphalt at
the corporate compound.
</P>
<P>
   Secretaries clutch the retailer's ``Homer'' mascot dolls.
Accountants and techies alike keep an eye on the empty podium.
About a thousand cubicle dwellers press closer to the makeshift
stage, their new aprons adding an orange splash to the sea of
khaki.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the crowd lets out a piercing round of whistles and
whoops, the kind you hear at ballgames, not Fortune 500 companies.
</P>
<P>
   At the microphone is Chairman and co-founder Bernard Marcus.
Around here, he's known as Bernie, the head honcho of hoopla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to thank you all for voting for me,'' jokes Marcus,
waving each hand with the victory sign. As with any Home Depot
event, the crowd kicks it off with a rousing H-O-M-E D-E-P-O-T
cheer.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, Marcus, who usually rallies the troops in the
stores, has herded the support staff at headquarters for a taste of
the Home Depot gusto.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to recognize all of you for the work you do, the
advertising, the behind-the-scenes roles,'' Marcus says. ``We talk
a lot about the stores, but we haven't thanked you for your role.''
</P>
<P>
   In five minutes the speech is over, and the employees start
lining up for what they were really waiting for: an autograph, a
wisecrack, a one-on-one with the guy who's helping set them up for
comfy retirement.
</P>
<P>
   People shove orange aprons, T-shirts and the company's
biography, ``Built from Scratch'' at Marcus for an autograph. One
woman presents Homer's rear end for a signature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at him _ he's like a rock star,'' says Dennis Carey,
executive vice president and chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   This is classic Bernie. In recent years, Marcus, 71, and partner
Arthur Blank, 57, chief executive and president, have gotten a lot
of attention for creating a nation of do-it-yourselfers with their
incredibly successful warehouse concept. But from the start, Marcus
was the one who took the limelight with his wit and charisma.
</P>
<P>
   Blank, an accountant by training, honed the financial side of
the business (which was nearly called ``Bad Bernies Buildall'').
Marcus was the extroverted visionary who duked it out with
investment bankers and won over skeptics.
</P>
<P>
   That charisma has drawn a loyal following over the years. Much
of what he tells employees today is age-old retail wisdom _ the
customer comes first, don't point, etc. _ but he delivers it in
such a convincing way that it seems bigger than life.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Bernie comes around, it's like this whoosh,'' says
Cumberland store manager Steve Moody, balling his fist as if he's
grabbing something. ``Whatever he says, I want a piece of it
because it gets me in the gut.''
</P>
<P>
   Moody, a former construction worker, reaches in his apron pocket
and pulls out a cloth wheel embroidered with the company's values.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's this simple: let's build some strong relationships, let's
take care of the customer, let's have an entrepreneurial spirit. .
.,'' says Moody, pointing out several other directives on the
wheel. ``If you really think about it, you do this at home. And
that's all he's asking, just be a good person.''
</P>
<P>
   As hokey as it sounds, the company's founders were determined to
build a workplace that made people feel good about their jobs after
Marcus and Blank were canned midway into their former careers.
</P>
<P>
   The pair met 26 years ago when both worked for Handy Dan
Improvement Centers, a hardware store chain in Los Angeles. They
both got fired after a run-in with their boss and decided the best
revenge was to create a bigger and better Handy Dan, picking
Atlanta as their testing ground.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus filled yellow legal pads with ideas for giant warehouse
stores while Blank tried to make the numbers work.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the duo seemed to hit one dead-end after the next,
Marcus was stubborn about certain principles. No matter how
desperate he felt, he seemed determined to stay in control. More
than that, Marcus refused to change his convictions for anybody.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Perot included.
</P>
<P>
   Perot, founder and then-chairman of Electronic Data Systems, was
on the verge of investing $2 million in Home Depot at a point when
the founders were begging for financing to open the first stores,
Marcus says.
</P>
<P>
   The fiesty Texan nearly became the majority owner of Home Depot
_ until he clashed with Marcus. During final negotiations, Marcus
was increasingly uneasy about the ``military'' style at EDS.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus says he was bothered by the corporate uniform of white
shirts and ties, the security guards and a general battle over who
was in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Perot declined to comment, but according to Marcus' account, the
fallout came when Marcus asked to be reimbursed for a used
Cadillac, his old company car that he was going to buy from Handy
Dan.
</P>
<P>
   ``My people don't drive Cadillacs,'' Marcus recalls Perot
saying. ``My guys. . .drive Chevrolets.''
</P>
<P>
   When Perot repeated it two more times, Marcus got up and walked
out on the $2 million. As Marcus saw it, if there was a conflict
over a used car, how much was in store over big business decisions?
According to Marcus, Perot was already throwing his weight around,
and Marcus didn't like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody controls my life but me,'' he recalls thinking.
</P>
<P>
   LEARNING OPTIMISM
</P>
<P>
   Marcus showed a tenacious side early on. He grew up in a
fourth-floor tenement in a predominantly black neighborhood in
Newark, N.J., during the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   As a preteen, he became a favorite target for a group of kids in
a neighborhood gang. After getting beaten up repeatedly, Marcus
impressed the gang leader with his nerve.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked me to join,'' Marcus recalls. At 11 years old, he was
second in command of 30 hoodlums who found other boys to beat up.
``I was in charge of strategy and expansion,'' Marcus quips.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Marcus says he was learning the values of optimism
and sharing from his parents, poor Russian immigrants who met in
America. He remembers his mother taking ice cream money away from
him and giving it to charities. ``Her belief was the more you give
the more you get,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Now worth more than $3 billion in direct Home Depot holdings
alone, Marcus has given away more than $120 million to date. His
pet project is the Marcus Institute, a treatment center for
children with brain and behavioral disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus and his wife, Billi, founded the center in 1990 and
supported it with $25 million in personal donations. Marcus
recently gave another $45 million to expand and merge the center
with the Kennedy Krieger Institute, a research center in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his charities focus on children, health care, education
and Jewish causes.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Marcus has worked to strengthen economic ties to
Israel. In addition to Home Depot's commitment to work with Israeli
suppliers, Marcus has led several trade missions on behalf of
Georgia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, he traveled to Israel with Gov. Roy Barnes to
recruit high-tech companies to Georgia. Marcus is also
international chairman of the Israel Democracy Institute, a
political think tank in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ALWAYS THE COMIC
</P>
<P>
   Marcus says he grew up in a fairly observant Jewish home and
went to synagogue with his father, a skilled cabinetmaker but
``terrible businessman'' who worked nonstop and still couldn't make
ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   Young Marcus wanted to become a doctor but couldn't afford
medical school. Instead, he settled for pharmacy school at Rutgers
University and paid his college expenses by testing the skills that
would pay off big later in life.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, he worked as a stand-up comic in the Catskill
Mountains. And Marcus said he frequently cut classes to sell Amana
freezers to homeowners in the flatlands of central and south New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   After Rutgers, Marcus worked at drugstores and cosmetics
companies before landing at Handy Dan. At that point, Marcus had
racked up quite a bit of retail know-how but was still punching
someone else's clock.
</P>
<P>
   The man who fired Marcus at Handy Dan, Sanford Sigoloff, later
told a Bloomberg News reporter that he had no regrets. Sigoloff
said that Marcus clearly didn't fit the corporate mold and was so
self-assured that he was ``just shy of being pompous.''
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1970s, it was clear to Marcus that he needed to
start his own business.
</P>
<P>
   TOUGH EARLY DAYS
</P>
<P>
   Through the persistence of longtime friend and investment banker
Ken Langone, Home Depot got the money to open four stores in
Atlanta in 1979, but the early days were tough. Managers used empty
boxes to make the store look packed with products because the
company couldn't afford to buy enough inventory. Marcus dispatched
his three children to hand out $1 bills in the parking lots to try
and lure people into the store.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle formed a brotherly bond between Marcus and Blank
and led to a camaraderie among employees as they continually
revamped the stores to find the right formula. Even when Home Depot
became a hit with customers, the founders encouraged employees to
keep speaking out.
</P>
<P>
   At shareholder meetings and on store tours, both men get an
earful from the rank-and-file on what's wrong at the stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bernie and Arthur want you to talk to them,'' says Sandy
Owenby, a store employee who has been with the company less than a
year. ``They may be worth billions, but they know you're out here
busting your butt to make money for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The pioneering spirit among employees in the early days has
evolved into a respect for what Marcus and Blank have accomplished
at Home Depot, longtime employees say. Some employee loyalty now is
tied to the prospects of early retirement. By Marcus' estimates,
the retailer has created about 2,000 millionaires, including
secretaries and store managers, through Home Depot's stock options
plan.
</P>
<P>
   THE PIED PIPER
</P>
<P>
   Keeping that gung-ho spirit alive is Marcus' priority as
chairman these days.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus handed the chief executive reins to Blank three years
ago. Since then, Marcus has concentrated on teaching training
classes.
</P>
<P>
   And he still visits stores, fielding questions and generally
hamming it up in the trenches.
</P>
<P>
   He used to personally tour each Home Depot store, but that's
impossible now. With 1,000 stores today and a new one opening on
the average of every 43 hours, the only way some employees will see
Marcus is on satellite TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to touch people the way I have in the past.
There's no question about that,'' Marcus says.
</P>
<P>
   ``All store managers and every officer will get exposure to
Arthur and myself. And hopefully they'll take the things we teach
them down to every level.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcus hosts interactive ``Welcome aboard'' shows to some new
stores so that employees have a chance to talk to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``On one recent (broadcast) we had people from Atlanta to
California and Saskatchewan,'' Marcus says.
</P>
<P>
   No matter where they're from, employees ask him the same thing:
How is Home Depot going to maintain its ``bleeding orange'' culture
if the company plans to double in size?
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer is, we will if everyone works at it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's up to managers and other officers to get the message
out to the masses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bernie is the original Pied Piper . . . but we're too big for
any one person to carry the banner,'' says Faye Wilson, senior vice
president of value initiatives and a board member.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, Blank began building up the bench of officers
at Home Depot. Although Marcus has said for years that they'd have
to carry him out before he'd retire, he recently said his focus had
changed a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do whatever Arthur needs me to do, although I'm slowing down
at Home Depot and picking up my (charitable) work,'' Marcus says.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the guy best known as Bernie seems to have a
grip on a new generation of workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that I'm supposed to do anything for the customer, even
if it's outrageous,'' says Acworth, Ga. store manager Stephanie
Wargo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a customer can't find a product, I'll go out and buy it and
bring it their house if I have to,'' says Wargo, a former social
worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of other (employees) feel the same way because Bernie is
so passionate about this place,'' she says. ``It's like he's your
dad, and you don't want to disappoint him.''

SIX OF THE NINE DUESSELDORF BOMB VICTIMS WERE JEWISH 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ The nine people injured by a bomb on Thursday in
Duesseldorf are immigrants, with six of them Jews, the police and
prosecutors said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Johannes Mocken, a spokesman for state prosecutors in the
western city, said the victims had just left their daily German
class at a language school when the bomb exploded on a metal
footbridge leading to the commuter station.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot exclude that somebody purposefully intended to kill
members of this group,'' Mocken said.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Otto Schily said it was reasonable to assume
that the attack had a racist motive.
</P>
<P>
   A prominent Jewish leader, Paul Spiegel, said: ``I don't want to
create any hysteria. But the fact is most of the victims were
Jewish, and it appears that they passed on the same route from
school every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of Jews in Germany has been growing rapidly over the
last decade, bolstered by waves of immigrants from the former
Soviet Union drawn here by the relative ease of obtaining residence
papers and generous financial aid. The country has 85,000
registered Jews compared with 29,000 at the beginning of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   A bomb against those immigrants would be a blow to Germany's
international image and a worrying indication that the extreme
right is becoming bolder and more organized.
</P>
<P>
   But no organization, rightist or other, has claimed
responsibility for the bombing, and the police said all possible
motives _ including some sort of feud between the Russian
immigrants _ remained under examination.
</P>
<P>
   One of the women wounded, identified by the police only as
Tatyana, 26, was six months pregnant, and her unborn child was
killed when shrapnel pierced her stomach. Her condition, and that
of her 28-year-old husband, Michael, were described as critical
Friday after both underwent long operations. Two other people
remained in serious condition.
</P>
<P>
   The immigrants came from Russia, Ukraine and Azerbaijan, the
police said. They had been taking German lessons provided as part
of the assistance given by the state to immigrants arriving here
and were about to board a train to nearby Solingen, where five
Turkish women and girls were killed in a firebomb attack in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-immigrant violence has risen steadily in Germany during the
1990s, spurred by high unemployment, frustration among idle youths
and well-organized if marginal neo-Nazi movements.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a 39-year-old black immigrant from Mozambique was
beaten to death by neo-Nazi skinheads in the eastern town of
Dessau, and the police dismantled what they described as a highly
organized and heavily armed rightist youth group near Dresden,
finding grenades, ignition devices and parts of rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's openness to Jewish immigration is rooted in a
deep-seated political conviction that the Holocaust makes any other
policy unthinkable, but also in a calculation that such
receptiveness is generally good for Germany as it asserts its
growing economic power.
</P>
<P>
   But protracted recent negotiations over compensation for
Nazi-era slave and forced laborers revealed a growing, if still
rarely expressed, impatience with what is sometimes described as
``Jewish blackmail.'' Last October, more than 100 headstones in
Europe's largest Jewish cemetery in Berlin were smashed or
overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Duesseldorf has been a major center of Jewish immigration over
the past decade. Michael Szentei-Heife, a Jewish leader there, said
6,300 Jews now lived in the area, of whom about 5,100 were Russian
emigres who arrived in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Their move to Germany stems from a decision to accept Jews from
the former Soviet Union that was made shortly after the fall of the
Berlin Wall by Helmut Kohl, then the chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   But this decision was never the subject of a parliamentary vote
or national debate, and the public view of the de facto rebuilding
of a German Jewish community all but extinguished by Hitler remains
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said this week that anti-immigrant
violence by rightist groups had reached unacceptable levels. ``We
need to make it clear that this damages our country, not only the
domestic peace but also our international image,'' he said.

 &HT;    Networks convention coverage plan: less is betterBy Diane
Holloway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ As Republicans prepare to open the convention
that will nominate George W. Bush for president, the networks are
putting the finishing touches on their high-tech skyboxes.
</P>
<P>
   Above the convention floor, the temporary homes for Peter
Jennings, Dan Rather, Tom Brokaw and the rest hover above expected
hordes. But with the exception of a few hours, the skyboxes for
ABC, CBS and NBC will be dark and empty. The PBS and cable news
headquarters, however, will be abuzz.
</P>
<P>
   This year's plan for network convention coverage _ an hour or
two in prime time on each of the four nights (except NBC, which has
no coverage Monday or Tuesday) _ is not new. Gavel-to-gavel
coverage disappeared from the Big Three in the 1970s, when the
primary process sapped the suspense from the conventions. And the
networks cut back even further when CNN arrived in the '80s. Why,
the networks wondered, should we scrap our popular programming to
put on convention coverage that Americans won't watch?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has different economic realities,'' says Tom Hannon,
political director for CNN, which plans to cover virtually all of
the political spectacle. ``One view is that there's a moral
responsibility to force-feed civic responsibility to the widest
possible audience. The other is there's a diversity of different
vehicles for people to follow the political campaign. As a result,
the broadcast networks no longer have a moral responsibility to
invest it with the kind of coverage they did when they were the
only game in town.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not surprising that cable executives aren't critical of the
networks for cutting back, since cable networks can actually
improve normally minuscule ratings during big events like the
conventions. The more ABC, CBS and NBC back off, the more CNN,
MSNBC and Fox News expect to gain. As long as the information can
be found somewhere, what's wrong with letting cable take over?
</P>
<P>
   ``The networks are finessing their responsibility, hiding behind
cliched excuses such as, 'Well, those Americans who are interested
can get it from PBS or CNN,' `` says Marvin Kalb, executive
director of Harvard's Shorenstein Center for Press, Politics and
Public Policy and a former CBS political reporter. ``All of those
cable stations put together wouldn't equal a quarter of what one
network does on a poor night.''
</P>
<P>
   Kalb believes the responsibility of the networks is no different
from what it was 30 or 40 years ago, when David Brinkley and Chet
Huntley manned the NBC booth from 9 a.m. until almost midnight
every night.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, we battled for the honor of covering them,''
Kalb says. ``It was, how much coverage can we provide, not how
little. The economics of the TV news business has changed the way
networks think of responsibility. It's no longer the public good;
it's what's good for profit and the stockholders. We all know about
competition and ratings, but the new element is this
'conglomeratization' of the industry _ NBC is owned by GE, ABC is
owned by Disney and CBS is owned by Viacom.''
</P>
<P>
   The networks, of course, defend their coverage plans, citing
lower news value and lack of viewer interest. (And past ratings
support at least half of that defense.) They say the amount of time
they're devoting to the Republicans is plenty, and viewers who want
more know where to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cable is there for the (political) junkies,'' says Mark
Halperin, political director for ABC News. ``The networks allow the
candidates to communicate with larger numbers of Americans. For us,
this is a chance to give major parties the chance to convey their
ideas and give the audience a look at the people trying to become
president. Spontaneity is minimum, but the nominees are giving the
biggest speech to the biggest audience they've ever spoken to, so
it's an important rite of passage.''
</P>
<P>
   The networks routinely cite the parties' attempts to ``stage
manage'' the news as another reason for cutting back. The glossy
candidate films are rarely shown, because the networks see them as
little more than propaganda. In '96, the Republicans spoke openly
of using their convention as an ``infomercial'' to get the party's
message out, and that was off-putting to the networks. Ted Koppel
pulled out of the convention then and took ``Nightline'' back to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``With small exceptions _ like what John McCain will say in his
speech that's nice about Bush _ there's no suspense,'' says
Halperin. ``We make choices about what we think is important to
share with viewers and what should come through unfiltered.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing rankles some people more than the charge that the
gatherings of the major political parties of the most powerful
nation on Earth aren't newsworthy. Kalb calls the conventions ``a
lesson in civics, the way in which we govern ourselves.'' Others
point out that there are stories to be found; they just require
more work than pointing a camera at the podium and rewriting a
press release.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't the train wreck type of story any more,'' says Jim
Lehrer, who will anchor three hours or more every night during both
political conventions. ``There aren't the big floor fights, but so
what? The conventions may be more difficult to cover now, but
perhaps it's more important that they be covered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a self-fulfilling prophesy. If you say it's boring, then
nobody's interested and nobody votes. I believe people still do
care, but we've got to cover the conventions beyond the podium. We
take the position that what the parties say and stand for is news,
but we want to put every word in context. That's just good,
old-fashioned journalism.''

 &HT;    Flightserv suspends operations, negotiates for funding
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Flightserv.com, the struggling Internet air service
provider, has suspended operations and cut its work force by more
than half as it seeks new financial backers.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based company said Friday it is considering an offer
to form an alliance with unnamed investors who would provide $2.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would involve the acquisition of companies in related
businesses and changes in management, Flightserv said in an
announcement. The company also would issue new shares.
</P>
<P>
   Flightserv President Todd Bottorff said he couldn't disclose
details of the restructuring pending negotiations with the
prospective backers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current thinking is our (business) model would be adjusted
but the general direction would be the same,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Flightserv was conceived to sell individual seats on chartered
private jets through its namesake Web site.
</P>
<P>
   It targeted business travelers looking for an alternative to
airline service.
</P>
<P>
   But since the site launched in May the company averaged only one
flight a week. Bottorff said Friday that operations are suspended
pending the potential restructuring. He said the company's work
force has been pared to 10 from 24.
</P>
<P>
   Executives have blamed the problems on an original backer's
refusal to contribute the second half of an expected $10 million
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Flightserv's founder and chief executive, C. Beverly Lance, is
the son of former Carter administration budget chief Bert Lance.
</P>
<P>
   He created Flightserv out of previous businesses. Its stock rose
rapidly last fall and winter, even before a business plan was
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   After peaking at $12 on the day the Web site debuted, the share
price steadily fell to under $1. Shares gained 6 cents Friday to 88
cents.
</P>
<P>
   Bottorff said Friday that Lance is still CEO but declined
comment on whether that will change under the restructuring.

 &HT;    Coca-Cola stock sees slow but steady' rise
 &HT;    By Christopher Seward
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Shares of Coca-Cola Co. closed above $62 Friday for
the first time since January.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second day of gains for the stock, which is up 9
percent since the beginning of the third quarter, or $5.19. The
stock closed at $62.63 Friday, up $2.19 on heavy volume.
</P>
<P>
   Banc of America analyst Scott Wilkins said Coke's performance is
a reflection of a ``slow but steady'' rise in investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are fewer dark clouds on Coke's horizon,'' said Wilkins.
``People have begun to focus on the numbers and are believing in
the numbers,'' he said, referring to the company's financial
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   After two consecutive money-losing quarters, Coca-Cola rebounded
to earn $926 million, or 37 cents a share, in the second quarter. A
rise in case volume, a key sales indicator of performance, was
helped by healthier economies in many parts of the world. The
results were a penny a share above Wall Street's estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkins said interest in the stock could reverse if the company
``backpedals'' on its earnings forecasts, but he doesn't think that
is likely.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola has said it is ``comfortable'' with full-year Wall
Street estimates of $1.44 a share, compared with 98 cents a share
last year and $1.42 in 1998. The company expects worldwide case
volume to grow 5 percent to 6 percent this year _ including brands
acquired from Cadbury Schweppes _ compared with 2 percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's stock Friday also may have benefited from news that
it has signed a deal to put its vending machines in 378 buildings
owned by Equity Office Properties Trust.
</P>
<P>
   The five-year deal with the nation's largest publicly held owner
and operator of office buildings puts Coke's products within reach
of 400,000 employees who work in those buildings daily. Coca-Cola
said it plans to install 500 of the vending machines within 12
months.
</P>
<P>
   While the agreement is with Coca-Cola, the vending machines will
be provided by the company's bottlers, the largest of which is
Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. Coca-Cola Co., which has
major equity stakes in its bottlers, provides the syrup bottlers
use to make soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the company could not say how much it expects to
benefit financially from the deal, or how much it will cost the
Coke system to supply the machines.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the business generated will not be material to the
company's bottom line. The biggest benefit is expected to be
exposure for Coca-Cola's brands.

   Next week: Finding romance at the Inn at the Park bed and
breakfast in Wichita. GUTHRIE, Okla. _ Ted Ballard claims to be a
man of few vices, save one: He collects things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never fished,'' he begins. ``I never drank. I never smoked.
I just collect things _ I just accumulate things.''
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, Ballard has amassed the world's largest collection
of lighters, which he keeps in a museum right next to the fire
station in Guthrie, a town of about 10,000 people 30 or so miles
north of Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   About 7,000 of his lighters _ ``mechanical pyrotechnic
apparatus'' in Ballard's parlance _ or about one-third of his
collection, are on display in at the National Lighter Museum, a
private venture operated by Ballard and his wife, Pat, since 1993.
Almost everything is for sale, but you can browse for free.
</P>
<P>
   There are Zippos, Ronsons and Dunhills, some of the favored
torches of cigarette, cigar and pipe smokers everywhere. A cheaper
collectible lighter, in mint condition, in the original box, will
bring $35 to $50 or more, Ballard says. His most valuable piece, a
wild boar tusk lighter, might be worth $20,000-$25,000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ballard, who turns 67 today, would like to use his lighter
collection to finance his retirement. He says the collection might
bring $500,000 from the right buyer, although he'd probably settle
for half of that if the buyer would keep the museum open. The
prices of lighters, or anything, depends on timing, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``Timing is everything,'' he says. ``I had the world's largest
toy collection in 1959. That was 30 years too soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Fascinated with mechanical things, Ballard repaired radios,
televisions and watches, and he was an amateur archaeologist before
he retired to the lighter museum, becoming a professional collector
and trader _ and philosopher.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scientific community,'' he says, ``uses man's firemaking
capability to tell how a civilization is socially and technically
evolved, compared to others.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WARREN, Mass. _ It is a midsummer mystery: The Case of the
Missing Lifeguard.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike a good beach read, it has no guarantee of a neat
solution. And the suffering of those who wait, pray and weep at
night is only too real.
</P>
<P>
   On June 27, 16-year-old Molly Ann Bish, a 5-foot-7-inch,
127-pound, honey-blond athlete, reported for her eighth day of work
as a lifeguard at Comins Pond, a serene pool ringed by pines, with
a water slide and a small beach. It is a popular swimming hole,
especially for young children, in this country town about 70 miles
west of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Molly's mother dropped her off as her shift began at 10 a.m.
Molly set up her things for the day: beach chair, flip-flops,
two-way radio, the lunch her mother had packed her.
</P>
<P>
   Then she disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a half-hour later, the first bathers arrived and found
there was no lifeguard, though a first-aid kit lay open by the
chair. Molly has not been seen again, at least not by anyone in
this town that has just about gone wild looking.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks in part to a local company that makes ribbons, no village
could ever have been more thoroughly trimmed in yellow _ Molly's
favorite color _ even at the very height of the Gulf War. The
ribbons adorn telephone poles, gateposts, car antennas, trees, even
the white columns of the town hall.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of townspeople have attended candle-lit vigils on the
town common, gone out to assist the professional searchers, fed to
the gills the two dozen state detectives working nonstop on the
case and kept up a steady stream of comfort calls on John and Magi
Bish, Molly's parents.
</P>
<P>
   The Bishes have also received more than 700 sympathy cards. They
said the cards help, baskets of them lying at their feet near a
shelf holding a lit candle flickering before Molly's junior prom
picture. The Bishes are also more grateful than they can say for
the police work and the town's outpouring of love, aid and food.
But as the days pass, the ordeal only gets worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult for me at nighttime, because that's when
the fears come,'' said Magi Bish, a special-education teacher and
former stay-at-home mother to Molly and her two older siblings. ``I
do a lot of crying and use a rosary.'' Now, at the the one-month
mark, she said, the hope that Molly is still alive is flickering.
</P>
<P>
   But ``the hardest fear,'' she said, ``is if she's out there
somewhere and someone's hurting her. If she's gone to heaven, I can
make peace with it, but the fear is the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   A disappearance like Molly's is relatively unusual, say national
experts on child abductions. Of the 850,000 children who are
reported missing each year, said Jerry Nance, a case manager with
the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, only 3
percent or 4 percent are considered ``missing and endangered,''
that is, neither runaways nor taken by a family member.
</P>
<P>
   According to Department of Justice figures, 300 children each
year are abducted by non-family members and are gone for a long
time or killed.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 4,600 abductions by non-family members nationwide are
reported to the police each year, compared with 354,000 children
taken by family members and 450,700 who run away.
</P>
<P>
   Molly's case has other unusual elements, Nance said: ``She's
older than most. It was daylight. She was at a workplace where
people would have known her. The whole window of opportunity for
the guy to have struck was very small, only 20 minutes. From the
standpoint of how the events happened, it couldn't have happened
any quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   State police refused on Thursday to discuss the investigation,
even as nearly 200 cadets from a nearby police academy set out into
the woods to practice some newly learned search techniques.
</P>
<P>
   But it appears highly unlikely Molly ran away _ a responsible
teen-ager on a welcome new job, packing nothing, leaving her shoes,
saying not a word to anybody. And police checks into sex offenders
living in the area have apparently yielded no breakthroughs.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Bish family, there is one strong lead: a
suspicious-looking fiftyish man with a mustache whom Magi Bish had
observed sitting in a white car in the pond parking lot the day
before Molly disappeared. She fixed him with a ``What are you doing
here?'' look, she said, and eventually he drove off.
</P>
<P>
   Though sketches of the man are plastered next to posters of
Molly on store windows in the town center, ``this individual has
not been found,'' Molly's mother said. ``It would help us immensely
if he came forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Bishes are trying to turn their pain into
something positive by talking about Molly, describing her goofy
charm, her honor-roll grades and her kindness to special-needs
children, and warning other parents that this could happen to them,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned that children aren't safe,'' Molly's father, a
probation officer, said. ``Now we know we have to redouble our
efforts _ everyone has to. Molly goes to work at a beach known for
its safety and ends up in harm's way _ everyone needs to be
informed about this type of situation to prevent it happening
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Molly's parents are convinced, they said, that someone lured her
into trouble by pretending to need her help. No matter how parents
teach children to be safe, her father said, they are by nature
trusting, and Molly would have responded to a call for help. There
was no sign of struggle but her parents presume some force may have
been involved.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that the abductor was a local resident who could
still be around adds a slight tinge of suspicion to the town's
striking crisis-time solidarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't understand how anyone would do something like this, so
you start looking at everyone and wondering who could it be?'' said
Marilyn Coltey, a schoolteacher.
</P>
<P>
   Some local parents have told Magi Bish that their children,
frightened, have been asking to share beds with each other or their
parents more than usual, and many parents seem to be heeding John
Bish's advice that they cannot be too overprotective.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter has a 2-year-old, and she won't let the kid out of
her sight now,'' said Gary Bateman, owner of the Warren Spa and
Package Store.
</P>
<P>
   Among the cards the Bish family has received are two from other
members of the saddest of fraternities: parents whose daughters
were abducted. The remains of one, a 9-year-old, turned up years
later in some woods in the Boston suburb where she disappeared; the
body of the other, a 10-year-old, turned up two months later in a
town just miles from here. Neither crime has been solved.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 2, Molly Bish will turn _ or would have turned _ 17.
Magi Bish is thinking about inviting some of Molly's friends over
for cake, she said, and asking them to do a good deed or act
extra-safely in Molly's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be Molly's voice until we find her, and we have to
find her,'' Magi Bish said. ``She brings joy to our house. She's
our sunshine-silly goose.''

   NATIVE AMERICAN MUSIC DESERVES IT'S OWN GRAMMY CATEGORY _
Columnist Karen Lincoln Michel argues that the recent decision by
the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences to add a Native
American category to the Grammy Awards lineup next year may be well
intended but falls short. The Academy created only one category:
best Native American Music Album. She writes: ``That's similar to
having a single award for Latin music ... It's going to be
extremely difficult to find the best Native American recording when
you consider the category also includes contemporary native music,
a growing genre in recent years.'' (slugged:

   BEYOND TICKLING THE IVORIES _ This excerpt from Emerge magazine
by contributing columnist Calvin Wilson looks at two of today's
American jazz greats, pianists Matthew Shipp and Andrew Hill. These
two experimental jazz artists have roots in the musical past.
Indeed, Shipp cites Hill, 62, as one of his idols. Wilson examines
the predecessors who inspired these two contemporary artists and
how they continue to set standards of their own. (slugged:

   SOFTENING THE GOP _ The GOP is making headway with Latino voters
these days, writes columnist James Garcia. But more than a few
Latino politicos will tell you this is inherently bad. If you are a
``Latino Republican,'' they say, you are a ``vendido,'' a sellout.
Maybe, maybe not. Garcia believes that if there is such a thing as
a kinder, gentler ``21st Century Republican Party,'' then it's
epitomized by its newest recruits _ Latinos. If Latinos can
moderate the Republican Party _ humanize it, make it truly more
compassionate than it has been _ then the Latino community, and the
nation as a whole, will be better off. (slugged:

   COME TOGETHER _ In this commentary from a recent issue of KoreAm
Journal, the writer, a Korean-American who wishes to remain
anonymous, offers his opinion on the historical meeting between
President Dae Jung Kim of South Korea and Chairman Jong II Kim of
North Korea. ``Both sides have their own ideas of how North and
South should become one,'' he writes. ``The agreement essentially
states that both sides agree to disagree on that issue. It will be
interesting to see how that works out.'' He closes his article by
stating that although his Korean side yearns for the two Koreas to
become one, the American in him is skeptical of the show of
friendship and doubtful of the ``Stalinist state's intentions.''

   NATIVE AMERICAN MUSIC DESERVES IT'S OWN GRAMMY CATEGORY _
Columnist Karen Lincoln Michel argues that the recent decision by
the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences to add a Native
American category to the Grammy Awards lineup next year may be well
intended but falls short. The Academy created only one category:
best Native American Music Album. She writes: ``That's similar to
having a single award for Latin music ... It's going to be
extremely difficult to find the best Native American recording when
you consider the category also includes contemporary native music,
a growing genre in recent years.'' (slugged:

   SOFTENING THE GOP _ The GOP is making headway with Latino voters
these days, writes columnist James Garcia. But more than a few
Latino politicos will tell you this is inherently bad. If you are a

Maybe, maybe not. Garcia believes that if there is such a thing as
a kinder, gentler ``21st Century Republican Party,'' then it's
epitomized by its newest recruits _ Latinos. If Latinos can
moderate the Republican Party _ humanize it, make it truly more
compassionate than it has been _ then the Latino community, and the

   COME TOGETHER _ In this commentary from a recent issue of KoreAm
Journal, the writer, a Korean-American who wishes to remain
anonymous, offers his opinion on the historical meeting between
President Dae Jung Kim of South Korea and Chairman Jong II Kim of
North Korea. ``Both sides have their own ideas of how North and
South should become one,'' he writes. ``The agreement essentially
states that both sides agree to disagree on that issue. It will be
interesting to see how that works out.'' He closes his article by
stating that although his Korean side yearns for the two Koreas to
become one, the American in him is skeptical of the show of
friendship and doubtful of the ``Stalinist state's intentions.''

NATIVE AMERICAN MUSIC DESERVES IT'S OWN GRAMMY CATEGORY

 By KAREN LINCOLN MICHEL  
 &HT;    My 80-year-old mother sings a song in our native language in
which she thanks Earthmaker for her life. She is a stroke victim
suffering from diabetes, heart disease and dementia, yet she looks
beyond her pain to honor the gift of life through song.
 &HT;    Dementia has robbed her of most of her memories, but she
recognizes certain songs. Among her favorite pastimes is listening
to American Indian powwow music and songs of the Native American
Church.
 &HT;    Their words often speak of simple, but potent messages. Some say
they have the power to heal. For my mother, they reconnect her to
her past.
 &HT;    In song, Mom carries on a musical tradition indigenous to this
country. The first songs heard in this part of creation were sung
by native voices like my mother's. So when the National Academy of
Recording Arts and Sciences decided recently to add a Native
American category to the Grammy Awards lineup next year, it struck
a chord with me. Finally, our beautiful songs will receive long
overdue recognition from the mainstream.
 &HT;    There's a big glitch, though. The academy created only one
category, which is best Native American Music Album.
 &HT;    That's similar to having a single award for Latin music, which,
by the way, has grown so large that the Grammys created a spin-off
award show. The ``First Annual Latin Grammy Awards'' is slated to
take place in September with 40 award categories.
 &HT;    It's going to be extremely difficult to find the best Native
American recording when you consider the category also includes
contemporary native music, a growing genre in recent years.
 &HT;    Contemporary versus traditional poses a big dilemma. How can you
compare a political protest song sung in English to a traditional
honor song in memory of tribal warriors? It's an apples-to-oranges
comparison.
 &HT;    At the very least, the recording academy ought to offer one
award for each type of native music.
 &HT;    In its broadest terms, traditional native music falls into two
areas. There are social songs, the kind sung around the powwow drum
and hand-held drums, and spiritual music, including the songs my
mother sings.
 &HT;    Each has its own distinctive style and origin as varied as the
557 American Indian and Alaska Native tribes officially recognized
by the U.S. government.
 &HT;    The same could be said of contemporary native musicians, whose
English lyrics speak of tribal perspectives on life and world
events.
 &HT;    A spokesman for the Grammys said it's going to take time to iron
out the wrinkles. A committee of Native American music experts is
being assembled to ensure that native music is categorized
properly.
 &HT;    For instance, a recording by the blues band Indigenous would be
judged as a blues album and not under the new category. That's
because the category recognizes and celebrates the music of Native
America _ not Native American musicians who may be performing a
mainstream genre of music.
 &HT;    It's a little strange that the new award falls under the folk
music field. When I think of folk music, performers such as Woody
Guthrie and Pete Seeger come to mind.
 &HT;    I can't imagine a native performer singing the folk classic,
``This Land is Your Land.'' Well, maybe if it were called, ``This
Land is My Land, This Land's not Your Land.''
 &HT;    I would argue that native music deserves a category all its own,
based on the definition of folk music widely accepted. The
academy's Web site links to a guide that defined folk music as that
which is ``composed and performed by amateurs and passed down in an
oral tradition devoid of formal training.''
 &HT;    Most native people I know who sing traditional songs learned
from their elders and practiced their craft for years.
 &HT;    My nephews have a traditional Ho-Chunk drum group called the
Thundercloud Singers. They grew up around the drum and learned the
songs from their Ho-Chunk relatives. Some of the old-timers are no
longer with us, and I know my nephews remember them when they sing
certain songs.
 &HT;    I consider their tutelage formal training.
 &HT;    The electronic music guide goes on to say that folk music may
also be considered the rural blues of the Mississippi Delta and the
drum-heavy music of northwestern Africa, ``not to mention any other
tribal or traditional genres.''
 &HT;    And they weren't mentioned _ for the longest time.
 &HT;    But thanks to a group of Native American musicians who pushed
for the new category, tribal genres will be recognized in 2001.
 &HT;    For all the potential problems in lumping together native music
into a single category, I'm glad the Grammy Awards will recognize
our music. It's a start.
 &HT;    Maybe it will give a larger audience to the kind of beautiful
songs my mother sings.

 By CALVIN WILSON  
 &HT;    Among the many charms of jazz is its questing nature. By
definition, the music is ever on a journey of discovery, with
performers taking new detours as listeners keep their ears attuned
to every turn.
 &HT;    But as in any art form, it's impossible to move ahead without
properly appreciating what's been done. And just as the recent work
of Wynton Marsalis is largely influenced by Duke Ellington, more
experimental jazz artists also have roots in the past.
 &HT;    Pianists Matthew Shipp and Andrew Hill, not only point to
predecessors who inspired them, but also continue to set standards
of their own. Frequently their music has been unencumbered by chord
changes, but so passionate are their compositions and performances
that questions of accessibility are more or less moot. Also on a
quest is keyboardist Alex Bugnon, who's back in the stores with a
new album that draws on straight-ahead influences while adhering to
his fusion agenda.
 &HT;    Shipp, 39, is a key player on the New York jazz scene and among
the more audacious artists on the music's edge. Not only has he
recorded well-regarded albums under his own name, such as The
Multiplication Table and DNA, but he has also distinguished himself
in a quartet led by saxophonist David S. Ware. His new album,
Pastoral Composure, on the Thirsty Ear label, consolidates his
position while opening up unexpected possibilities. Shipp's
accompanists on the disc are trumpeter Roy Campbell, bassist
William Parker and drummer Gerald Cleaver. While longtime fans will
relish the Pianist's anarchic imagination and exploratory way with
a melody line, they may also be surprised by two tracks that are,
for Shipp, surprisingly straight-ahead.
 &HT;    ``I'm thought of as being in the vanguard, but there are many
facets to where I've come from,'' Shipp says. ``Visions'' and
``Progression,'' the compositions in question, ``are still my
music, my language.'' The challenge in making the album was ``to
make it all work, so that it all seemed to be an outgrowth of my
musical vision and so that it all made sense within that context.''
 &HT;    Pastoral Composure is a milestone for Shipp in another way: It's
the first in a new line of jazz albums on Thirsty Ear, called The
Blue Series and to be produced by the pianist.
 &HT;    ``I couldn't really pass up the opportunity,'' said the
Wilmington, Del., native, who moved to New York in the '80s.
 &HT;    The urge to experiment, while also holding onto established
turf, is one that Alex Bugnon can probably appreciate. On ... As
Promised (Narada), the smooth-jazz favorite stays deep in the
groove, while also nodding to a bop vibe. With heavy-duty guest
stars like singer Angie Stone and saxophonist Branford Marsalis,
Bugnon maintains his reputation for reconciling jazz with funk.
 &HT;    Hill, 62, has been a jazz icon since releasing a series of
influential, classic recordings on Blue Note Records in the '60s.
Arguably, his masterpiece was Point of Departure, a 1964 album on
which he led a stellar ensemble that included saxophonists Joe
Henderson and Eric Dolphy. Blue Note recently reissued Grass Roots,
a fine recording with a hard-bop emphasis that features trumpeter
Lee Morgan and saxophonist Booker Ervin.
 &HT;    Hill's latest effort, Dusk, on the Palmetto label, proves that
the pianist's touch and talent are very much intact. Whether he's
tossing off pointillistic solos on the title track or romping
through the wildly boppish ``Ball Square,'' Hill singularly
investigates the possibilities of musical space, and pushes
harmonic and melodic limits. It doesn't hurt that the band on Dusk
_ including saxophonists Greg Tardy and Marty Ehrlich, trumpeter
Ron Horton, bassist Scott Colley and drummer Billy Drummond _ has
been Hill's working group for more than two years.
 &HT;    ``We got together and rehearsed twice a week, without any job or
money,'' the pianist says. ``Which is a rare situation for New York
City.''
 &HT;    When the combo started playing in clubs, the strong audience
response was gratifying. In fact, it reminded him of his early days
as a player in his hometown Chicago, when he served as sideman to
such luminaries as Charlie Parker and Miles Davis.
 &HT;    ``There were jazz clubs that New York musicians used to come
through,'' Hill says. ``And growing up in Chicago, you had so many
great, unknown artists that were never recorded.''
 &HT;    It was through playing alongside such masters that the pianist
found his own voice _ and his own path. Indeed, Shipp cites Hill as
one of his idols.
 &HT;    ``His Blue Note albums are a world unto themselves,'' Shipp
says. ``Modernistic and futuristic in their general thrust, but at
the same time, very rooted in the piano jazz tradition.''
 &HT;    Which also happens to be an apt description of Shipp's own
music.

 By JAMES E. GARCIA  
 &HT;    The GOP is making headway with Latino voters these days. That's
undeniable. But more than a few Latino politicos will tell you this
is inherently bad.
 &HT;    If you are a ``Latino Republican,'' they say, you are a
``vendido,'' a sell out. Maybe, maybe not.
 &HT;    Those who know me count me among the crowd far to the left of
George W. Bush and company. It's a fair assessment. I'm even to the
left of Bill Clinton and company. In other words, the GOP won't be
signing me up anytime soon.
 &HT;    Having said that, I do see a silver lining in the shift of many
Latinos to the GOP's ranks.
 &HT;    Although the polls don't articulate this, I believe that if
there is such a thing as a kinder, gentler ``21st Century
Republican Party,'' as one conservative pundit recently described
it, then it's epitomized by its newest recruits _ Latinos.
 &HT;    The good news for the Latino community is that the Latinos who
are joining the GOP are having a moderating affect on the party.
When Latino Republicans say, ``George W. Bush is not Pete Wilson,''
they mean, ``Don't expect me to stick with this party if it starts
to bash immigrants.''
 &HT;    If Latino Republicans say, ``Let's give school vouchers a
chance,'' they more often than not mean, ``Let's find a way to
improve the quality of low-performing schools that aren't doing a
very good job of teaching our children what they need to know.''
 &HT;    Latino Republicans, along with suburban white women and
Independents, are putting the ``compassion'' into ``compassionate
conservatism'' _ not Bush.
 &HT;    For the past few years, the GOP has been working feverishly to
convince swing voters that they're really not that mean. Time and
again, Latino Republicans will tell you that George W. Bush is
nothing like ex-California Gov. Pete Wilson, the Genghis Khan of
the GOP's scorched-earth, anti-immigrant crusades of the 1990s.
 &HT;    True, Wilson's strategy of blaming his state's economic woes on
powerless immigrants, namely Latino immigrants, did get him
re-elected in 1994. But it also made Latinos angry.
 &HT;    And the community got angrier when Newt Gingrich and company
followed up on the Wilsonian Principle _ that is, inspire your core
constituency by demonizing the weak _ and passed a slew of
punitive, anti-immigrant and anti-poor measures in Congress. (It's
worth noting that President Clinton didn't do much to block the
Republican onslaught. He was looking to get re-elected in 1996.)
 &HT;    But the Republicans backed off as soon as they realized that an
angry Latino constituency is an active Latino constituency.
Wilson's willingness to bash Latino immigrants inspired hundreds of
thousands, perhaps millions, of Latinos to register to vote. And
vote they did _ for Democrats.
 &HT;    In 1996, more than 70 percent of Latino voters backed Clinton's
re-election. And Latinos voted again in droves for Democratic
candidates during the 1998 elections.
 &HT;    Now fast-forward to Campaign 2000: Bush and Gore are locked in a
neck-and-neck race for the presidency. Both know they'll need every
swing vote to win in November. And Latino voters are a vital part
of that equation.
 &HT;    There are other dynamics at work. Latinos of voting age have
reached critical numbers. Even a moderate election-day turnout
among Latino voters could make a difference in a close race.
Illinois and Florida quickly come to mind. There also are important
state and federal legislative races to consider.
 &HT;    For the Republicans, the good news is that the Latino community
has a burgeoning middle class whose social and cultural values are
mostly conservative.
 &HT;    But like any true hierarchy, it's the managers who make the
decisions. And without flexing their political and economic clout,
Latinos will never gain enough power in Democratic or Republican
circles to assume the powerbroker roles.
 &HT;    So, ``Latino Republicans'' can be a good thing. If nothing else,
they show the Democrats that Latino votes cannot be taken for
granted. Latino Independents or Green Party members would move the
community a step further.
 &HT;    In the end, public policy should be based on what is good for
the public at large _ all of the public. The guiding moral
principle of this nation should be people-ism, not liberalism or
conservatism.
 &HT;    If Latinos can moderate the Republican Party, humanize it, make
it truly more compassionate than it has been, then our community _
and the nation as a whole _ will be better off.

 Excerpted from KoreAm Journal  
 &HT;    ``Happy Father's Day, Dad!'' I said.
 &HT;    ``Thanks, Son.''
 &HT;    ``What time is it there in Korea?'' I asked.
 &HT;    ``Oh, about 12:30 a.m.''
 &HT;    ``Oops, sorry about that.''
 &HT;    ``That's OK,'' he said. ``Thank you for calling!''
 &HT;    ``How is it over there? Is everybody excited about the North and
South Korean Summit?''
 &HT;    ``Well, a little. But there's still a long way to go.''
 &HT;    That was the extent of my in-depth investigative journalism into
the historical meeting between the two Kims of our divided
motherland.
 &HT;    My father, who still lives in South Korea, has seen a lot.
Political posturing does not easily impress him. And though he
sounded positive about this recent turn of events, he still
remains, for the most part, largely guarded in his optimism, as do
I.
 &HT;    As it stands, South Korea is at a stage where Japan was back in
the late 1960s and early 1970s. Think about it. Rapidly growing
technological and manufacturing prowess combined with (relatively)
cheap labor have given South Korean companies the power to make
inroads into the worldwide market.
 &HT;    But it needs a boost _ a boost that can come from the North.
 &HT;    A massive infusion of super-cheap labor that, most importantly,
speaks the same language can bequeath unto South Korean companies
with existing international trade and distribution channels the
wherewithal to severely undercut its global competitors. How about
a Hyundai Tiburon for $5,000? Or a Goldstar 13-inch TV/VCR combo
set for $50?
 &HT;    Is this really big news? Or is this just a lot of hot air from
both sides of the 38th Parallel? Could this really spell the end of
tension between two forces at odds for half a century? Or are the
two Kims simply pandering to their own personal agendas?
 &HT;    Only time will tell. And only one thing is for certain: Nothing
definitive has been hammered out.
 &HT;    Oh sure, the recently signed agreement mentions the reuniting of
families separated during the war. But it doesn't mention how many
and when.
 &HT;    And if you read between the lines of the agreement, you see that
the path to reunification will not be an easy one. Both sides have
their own ideas of how North and South should become one. The
agreement essentially states that both sides agree to disagree on
that issue. It will be interesting to see how that works out. The
U.S. government has the same stance.
 &HT;    While lifting many 50-year-old economic sanctions and embargoes
against North Korea, the United States, like my father, is
tempering its enthusiasm with caution. Changing North Korea's
``rogue nation'' status to that of a ``state of concern'' is about
as far as Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was willing to go.
 &HT;    President Clinton, himself, sent the message that as long as
North Korea maintained its moratorium on its missile-testing
program, things would progress toward the positive.
 &HT;    So, is this really big news? You bet it is. Is reunification
just around the corner? No way.
 &HT;    My Korean side yearns for the two Koreas to become one and is
elated at the prospect. But the American in me is skeptical of the
show of friendship and doubtful of the Stalinist state's
intentions. So, like Dad, I too am feeling guarded enthusiasm.

NATIVE AMERICAN MUSIC DESERVES IT'S OWN GRAMMY CATEGORY  
 &HT;

 By KAREN LINCOLN MICHEL  
 &HT;    My 80-year-old mother sings a song in our native language in
which she thanks Earthmaker for her life. She is a stroke victim
suffering from diabetes, heart disease and dementia, yet she looks
beyond her pain to honor the gift of life through song.
 &HT;    Dementia has robbed her of most of her memories, but she
recognizes certain songs. Among her favorite pastimes is listening
to American Indian powwow music and songs of the Native American
Church.
 &HT;    Their words often speak of simple, but potent messages. Some say
they have the power to heal. For my mother, they reconnect her to
her past.
 &HT;    In song, Mom carries on a musical tradition indigenous to this
country. The first songs heard in this part of creation were sung
by native voices like my mother's. So when the National Academy of
Recording Arts and Sciences decided recently to add a Native
American category to the Grammy Awards lineup next year, it struck
a chord with me. Finally, our beautiful songs will receive long
overdue recognition from the mainstream.
 &HT;    There's a big glitch, though. The academy created only one
category, which is best Native American Music Album.
 &HT;    That's similar to having a single award for Latin music, which,
by the way, has grown so large that the Grammys created a spin-off
award show. The ``First Annual Latin Grammy Awards'' is slated to
take place in September with 40 award categories.
 &HT;    It's going to be extremely difficult to find the best Native
American recording when you consider the category also includes
contemporary native music, a growing genre in recent years.
 &HT;    Contemporary versus traditional poses a big dilemma. How can you
compare a political protest song sung in English to a traditional
honor song in memory of tribal warriors? It's an apples-to-oranges
comparison.
 &HT;    At the very least, the recording academy ought to offer one
award for each type of native music.
 &HT;    In its broadest terms, traditional native music falls into two
areas. There are social songs, the kind sung around the powwow drum
and hand-held drums, and spiritual music, including the songs my
mother sings.
 &HT;    Each has its own distinctive style and origin as varied as the
557 American Indian and Alaska Native tribes officially recognized
by the U.S. government.
 &HT;    The same could be said of contemporary native musicians, whose
English lyrics speak of tribal perspectives on life and world
events.
 &HT;    A spokesman for the Grammys said it's going to take time to iron
out the wrinkles. A committee of Native American music experts is
being assembled to ensure that native music is categorized
properly.
 &HT;    For instance, a recording by the blues band Indigenous would be
judged as a blues album and not under the new category. That's
because the category recognizes and celebrates the music of Native
America _ not Native American musicians who may be performing a
mainstream genre of music.
 &HT;    It's a little strange that the new award falls under the folk
music field. When I think of folk music, performers such as Woody
Guthrie and Pete Seeger come to mind.
 &HT;    I can't imagine a native performer singing the folk classic,
``This Land is Your Land.'' Well, maybe if it were called, ``This
Land is My Land, This Land's not Your Land.''
 &HT;    I would argue that native music deserves a category all its own,
based on the definition of folk music widely accepted. The
academy's Web site links to a guide that defined folk music as that
which is ``composed and performed by amateurs and passed down in an
oral tradition devoid of formal training.''
 &HT;    Most native people I know who sing traditional songs learned
from their elders and practiced their craft for years.
 &HT;    My nephews have a traditional Ho-Chunk drum group called the
Thundercloud Singers. They grew up around the drum and learned the
songs from their Ho-Chunk relatives. Some of the old-timers are no
longer with us, and I know my nephews remember them when they sing
certain songs.
 &HT;    I consider their tutelage formal training.
 &HT;    The electronic music guide goes on to say that folk music may
also be considered the rural blues of the Mississippi Delta and the
drum-heavy music of northwestern Africa, ``not to mention any other
tribal or traditional genres.''
 &HT;    And they weren't mentioned _ for the longest time.
 &HT;    But thanks to a group of Native American musicians who pushed
for the new category, tribal genres will be recognized in 2001.
 &HT;    For all the potential problems in lumping together native music
into a single category, I'm glad the Grammy Awards will recognize
our music. It's a start.
 &HT;    Maybe it will give a larger audience to the kind of beautiful
songs my mother sings.

 By CALVIN WILSON  
 &HT;    Among the many charms of jazz is its questing nature. By
definition, the music is ever on a journey of discovery, with
performers taking new detours as listeners keep their ears attuned
to every turn.
 &HT;    But as in any art form, it's impossible to move ahead without
properly appreciating what's been done. And just as the recent work
of Wynton Marsalis is largely influenced by Duke Ellington, more
experimental jazz artists also have roots in the past.
 &HT;    Pianists Matthew Shipp and Andrew Hill, not only point to
predecessors who inspired them, but also continue to set standards
of their own. Frequently their music has been unencumbered by chord
changes, but so passionate are their compositions and performances
that questions of accessibility are more or less moot. Also on a
quest is keyboardist Alex Bugnon, who's back in the stores with a
new album that draws on straight-ahead influences while adhering to
his fusion agenda.
 &HT;    Shipp, 39, is a key player on the New York jazz scene and among
the more audacious artists on the music's edge. Not only has he
recorded well-regarded albums under his own name, such as The
Multiplication Table and DNA, but he has also distinguished himself
in a quartet led by saxophonist David S. Ware. His new album,
Pastoral Composure, on the Thirsty Ear label, consolidates his
position while opening up unexpected possibilities. Shipp's
accompanists on the disc are trumpeter Roy Campbell, bassist
William Parker and drummer Gerald Cleaver. While longtime fans will
relish the Pianist's anarchic imagination and exploratory way with
a melody line, they may also be surprised by two tracks that are,
for Shipp, surprisingly straight-ahead.
 &HT;    ``I'm thought of as being in the vanguard, but there are many
facets to where I've come from,'' Shipp says. ``Visions'' and
``Progression,'' the compositions in question, ``are still my
music, my language.'' The challenge in making the album was ``to
make it all work, so that it all seemed to be an outgrowth of my
musical vision and so that it all made sense within that context.''
 &HT;    Pastoral Composure is a milestone for Shipp in another way: It's
the first in a new line of jazz albums on Thirsty Ear, called The
Blue Series and to be produced by the pianist.
 &HT;    ``I couldn't really pass up the opportunity,'' said the
Wilmington, Del., native, who moved to New York in the '80s.
 &HT;    The urge to experiment, while also holding onto established
turf, is one that Alex Bugnon can probably appreciate. On ... As
Promised (Narada), the smooth-jazz favorite stays deep in the
groove, while also nodding to a bop vibe. With heavy-duty guest
stars like singer Angie Stone and saxophonist Branford Marsalis,
Bugnon maintains his reputation for reconciling jazz with funk.
 &HT;    Hill, 62, has been a jazz icon since releasing a series of
influential, classic recordings on Blue Note Records in the '60s.
Arguably, his masterpiece was Point of Departure, a 1964 album on
which he led a stellar ensemble that included saxophonists Joe
Henderson and Eric Dolphy. Blue Note recently reissued Grass Roots,
a fine recording with a hard-bop emphasis that features trumpeter
Lee Morgan and saxophonist Booker Ervin.
 &HT;    Hill's latest effort, Dusk, on the Palmetto label, proves that
the pianist's touch and talent are very much intact. Whether he's
tossing off pointillistic solos on the title track or romping
through the wildly boppish ``Ball Square,'' Hill singularly
investigates the possibilities of musical space, and pushes
harmonic and melodic limits. It doesn't hurt that the band on Dusk
_ including saxophonists Greg Tardy and Marty Ehrlich, trumpeter
Ron Horton, bassist Scott Colley and drummer Billy Drummond _ has
been Hill's working group for more than two years.
 &HT;    ``We got together and rehearsed twice a week, without any job or
money,'' the pianist says. ``Which is a rare situation for New York
City.''
 &HT;    When the combo started playing in clubs, the strong audience
response was gratifying. In fact, it reminded him of his early days
as a player in his hometown Chicago, when he served as sideman to
such luminaries as Charlie Parker and Miles Davis.
 &HT;    ``There were jazz clubs that New York musicians used to come
through,'' Hill says. ``And growing up in Chicago, you had so many
great, unknown artists that were never recorded.''
 &HT;    It was through playing alongside such masters that the pianist
found his own voice _ and his own path. Indeed, Shipp cites Hill as
one of his idols.
 &HT;    ``His Blue Note albums are a world unto themselves,'' Shipp
says. ``Modernistic and futuristic in their general thrust, but at
the same time, very rooted in the piano jazz tradition.''
 &HT;    Which also happens to be an apt description of Shipp's own
music.

 By JAMES E. GARCIA  
 &HT;    The GOP is making headway with Latino voters these days. That's
undeniable. But more than a few Latino politicos will tell you this
is inherently bad.
 &HT;    If you are a ``Latino Republican,'' they say, you are a
``vendido,'' a sell out. Maybe, maybe not.
 &HT;    Those who know me count me among the crowd far to the left of
George W. Bush and company. It's a fair assessment. I'm even to the
left of Bill Clinton and company. In other words, the GOP won't be
signing me up anytime soon.
 &HT;    Having said that, I do see a silver lining in the shift of many
Latinos to the GOP's ranks.
 &HT;    Although the polls don't articulate this, I believe that if
there is such a thing as a kinder, gentler ``21st Century
Republican Party,'' as one conservative pundit recently described
it, then it's epitomized by its newest recruits _ Latinos.
 &HT;    The good news for the Latino community is that the Latinos who
are joining the GOP are having a moderating affect on the party.
When Latino Republicans say, ``George W. Bush is not Pete Wilson,''
they mean, ``Don't expect me to stick with this party if it starts
to bash immigrants.''
 &HT;    If Latino Republicans say, ``Let's give school vouchers a
chance,'' they more often than not mean, ``Let's find a way to
improve the quality of low-performing schools that aren't doing a
very good job of teaching our children what they need to know.''
 &HT;    Latino Republicans, along with suburban white women and
Independents, are putting the ``compassion'' into ``compassionate
conservatism'' _ not Bush.
 &HT;    For the past few years, the GOP has been working feverishly to
convince swing voters that they're really not that mean. Time and
again, Latino Republicans will tell you that George W. Bush is
nothing like ex-California Gov. Pete Wilson, the Genghis Khan of
the GOP's scorched-earth, anti-immigrant crusades of the 1990s.
 &HT;    True, Wilson's strategy of blaming his state's economic woes on
powerless immigrants, namely Latino immigrants, did get him
re-elected in 1994. But it also made Latinos angry.
 &HT;    And the community got angrier when Newt Gingrich and company
followed up on the Wilsonian Principle _ that is, inspire your core
constituency by demonizing the weak _ and passed a slew of
punitive, anti-immigrant and anti-poor measures in Congress. (It's
worth noting that President Clinton didn't do much to block the
Republican onslaught. He was looking to get re-elected in 1996.)
 &HT;    But the Republicans backed off as soon as they realized that an
angry Latino constituency is an active Latino constituency.
Wilson's willingness to bash Latino immigrants inspired hundreds of
thousands, perhaps millions, of Latinos to register to vote. And
vote they did _ for Democrats.
 &HT;    In 1996, more than 70 percent of Latino voters backed Clinton's
re-election. And Latinos voted again in droves for Democratic
candidates during the 1998 elections.
 &HT;    Now fast-forward to Campaign 2000: Bush and Gore are locked in a
neck-and-neck race for the presidency. Both know they'll need every
swing vote to win in November. And Latino voters are a vital part
of that equation.
 &HT;    There are other dynamics at work. Latinos of voting age have
reached critical numbers. Even a moderate election-day turnout
among Latino voters could make a difference in a close race.
Illinois and Florida quickly come to mind. There also are important
state and federal legislative races to consider.
 &HT;    For the Republicans, the good news is that the Latino community
has a burgeoning middle class whose social and cultural values are
mostly conservative.
 &HT;    But like any true hierarchy, it's the managers who make the
decisions. And without flexing their political and economic clout,
Latinos will never gain enough power in Democratic or Republican
circles to assume the powerbroker roles.
 &HT;    So, ``Latino Republicans'' can be a good thing. If nothing else,
they show the Democrats that Latino votes cannot be taken for
granted. Latino Independents or Green Party members would move the
community a step further.
 &HT;    In the end, public policy should be based on what is good for
the public at large _ all of the public. The guiding moral
principle of this nation should be people-ism, not liberalism or
conservatism.
 &HT;    If Latinos can moderate the Republican Party, humanize it, make
it truly more compassionate than it has been, then our community _
and the nation as a whole _ will be better off.

 Excerpted from KoreAm Journal  
 &HT;    ``Happy Father's Day, Dad!'' I said.
 &HT;    ``Thanks, Son.''
 &HT;    ``What time is it there in Korea?'' I asked.
 &HT;    ``Oh, about 12:30 a.m.''
 &HT;    ``Oops, sorry about that.''
 &HT;    ``That's OK,'' he said. ``Thank you for calling!''
 &HT;    ``How is it over there? Is everybody excited about the North and
South Korean Summit?''
 &HT;    ``Well, a little. But there's still a long way to go.''
 &HT;    That was the extent of my in-depth investigative journalism into
the historical meeting between the two Kims of our divided
motherland.
 &HT;    My father, who still lives in South Korea, has seen a lot.
Political posturing does not easily impress him. And though he
sounded positive about this recent turn of events, he still
remains, for the most part, largely guarded in his optimism, as do
I.
 &HT;    As it stands, South Korea is at a stage where Japan was back in
the late 1960s and early 1970s. Think about it. Rapidly growing
technological and manufacturing prowess combined with (relatively)
cheap labor have given South Korean companies the power to make
inroads into the worldwide market.
 &HT;    But it needs a boost _ a boost that can come from the North.
 &HT;    A massive infusion of super-cheap labor that, most importantly,
speaks the same language can bequeath unto South Korean companies
with existing international trade and distribution channels the
wherewithal to severely undercut its global competitors. How about
a Hyundai Tiburon for $5,000? Or a Goldstar 13-inch TV/VCR combo
set for $50?
 &HT;    Is this really big news? Or is this just a lot of hot air from
both sides of the 38th Parallel? Could this really spell the end of
tension between two forces at odds for half a century? Or are the
two Kims simply pandering to their own personal agendas?
 &HT;    Only time will tell. And only one thing is for certain: Nothing
definitive has been hammered out.
 &HT;    Oh sure, the recently signed agreement mentions the reuniting of
families separated during the war. But it doesn't mention how many
and when.
 &HT;    And if you read between the lines of the agreement, you see that
the path to reunification will not be an easy one. Both sides have
their own ideas of how North and South should become one. The
agreement essentially states that both sides agree to disagree on
that issue. It will be interesting to see how that works out. The
U.S. government has the same stance.
 &HT;    While lifting many 50-year-old economic sanctions and embargoes
against North Korea, the United States, like my father, is
tempering its enthusiasm with caution. Changing North Korea's
``rogue nation'' status to that of a ``state of concern'' is about
as far as Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was willing to go.
 &HT;    President Clinton, himself, sent the message that as long as
North Korea maintained its moratorium on its missile-testing
program, things would progress toward the positive.
 &HT;    So, is this really big news? You bet it is. Is reunification
just around the corner? No way.
 &HT;    My Korean side yearns for the two Koreas to become one and is
elated at the prospect. But the American in me is skeptical of the
show of friendship and doubtful of the Stalinist state's
intentions. So, like Dad, I too am feeling guarded enthusiasm.

NATIVE AMERICAN MUSIC DESERVES IT'S OWN GRAMMY CATEGORY  
 &HT;

 By KAREN LINCOLN MICHEL  
 &HT;    My 80-year-old mother sings a song in our native language in
which she thanks Earthmaker for her life. She is a stroke victim
suffering from diabetes, heart disease and dementia, yet she looks
beyond her pain to honor the gift of life through song.
 &HT;    Dementia has robbed her of most of her memories, but she
recognizes certain songs. Among her favorite pastimes is listening
to American Indian powwow music and songs of the Native American
Church.
 &HT;    Their words often speak of simple, but potent messages. Some say
they have the power to heal. For my mother, they reconnect her to
her past.
 &HT;    In song, Mom carries on a musical tradition indigenous to this
country. The first songs heard in this part of creation were sung
by native voices like my mother's. So when the National Academy of
Recording Arts and Sciences decided recently to add a Native
American category to the Grammy Awards lineup next year, it struck
a chord with me. Finally, our beautiful songs will receive long
overdue recognition from the mainstream.
 &HT;    There's a big glitch, though. The academy created only one
category, which is best Native American Music Album.
 &HT;    That's similar to having a single award for Latin music, which,
by the way, has grown so large that the Grammys created a spin-off
award show. The ``First Annual Latin Grammy Awards'' is slated to
take place in September with 40 award categories.
 &HT;    It's going to be extremely difficult to find the best Native
American recording when you consider the category also includes
contemporary native music, a growing genre in recent years.
 &HT;    Contemporary versus traditional poses a big dilemma. How can you
compare a political protest song sung in English to a traditional
honor song in memory of tribal warriors? It's an apples-to-oranges
comparison.
 &HT;    At the very least, the recording academy ought to offer one
award for each type of native music.
 &HT;    In its broadest terms, traditional native music falls into two
areas. There are social songs, the kind sung around the powwow drum
and hand-held drums, and spiritual music, including the songs my
mother sings.
 &HT;    Each has its own distinctive style and origin as varied as the
557 American Indian and Alaska Native tribes officially recognized
by the U.S. government.
 &HT;    The same could be said of contemporary native musicians, whose
English lyrics speak of tribal perspectives on life and world
events.
 &HT;    A spokesman for the Grammys said it's going to take time to iron
out the wrinkles. A committee of Native American music experts is
being assembled to ensure that native music is categorized
properly.
 &HT;    For instance, a recording by the blues band Indigenous would be
judged as a blues album and not under the new category. That's
because the category recognizes and celebrates the music of Native
America _ not Native American musicians who may be performing a
mainstream genre of music.
 &HT;    It's a little strange that the new award falls under the folk
music field. When I think of folk music, performers such as Woody
Guthrie and Pete Seeger come to mind.
 &HT;    I can't imagine a native performer singing the folk classic,
``This Land is Your Land.'' Well, maybe if it were called, ``This
Land is My Land, This Land's not Your Land.''
 &HT;    I would argue that native music deserves a category all its own,
based on the definition of folk music widely accepted. The
academy's Web site links to a guide that defined folk music as that
which is ``composed and performed by amateurs and passed down in an
oral tradition devoid of formal training.''
 &HT;    Most native people I know who sing traditional songs learned
from their elders and practiced their craft for years.
 &HT;    My nephews have a traditional Ho-Chunk drum group called the
Thundercloud Singers. They grew up around the drum and learned the
songs from their Ho-Chunk relatives. Some of the old-timers are no
longer with us, and I know my nephews remember them when they sing
certain songs.
 &HT;    I consider their tutelage formal training.
 &HT;    The electronic music guide goes on to say that folk music may
also be considered the rural blues of the Mississippi Delta and the
drum-heavy music of northwestern Africa, ``not to mention any other
tribal or traditional genres.''
 &HT;    And they weren't mentioned _ for the longest time.
 &HT;    But thanks to a group of Native American musicians who pushed
for the new category, tribal genres will be recognized in 2001.
 &HT;    For all the potential problems in lumping together native music
into a single category, I'm glad the Grammy Awards will recognize
our music. It's a start.
 &HT;    Maybe it will give a larger audience to the kind of beautiful
songs my mother sings.

 By CALVIN WILSON  
 &HT;    Among the many charms of jazz is its questing nature. By
definition, the music is ever on a journey of discovery, with
performers taking new detours as listeners keep their ears attuned
to every turn.
 &HT;    But as in any art form, it's impossible to move ahead without
properly appreciating what's been done. And just as the recent work
of Wynton Marsalis is largely influenced by Duke Ellington, more
experimental jazz artists also have roots in the past.
 &HT;    Pianists Matthew Shipp and Andrew Hill, not only point to
predecessors who inspired them, but also continue to set standards
of their own. Frequently their music has been unencumbered by chord
changes, but so passionate are their compositions and performances
that questions of accessibility are more or less moot. Also on a
quest is keyboardist Alex Bugnon, who's back in the stores with a
new album that draws on straight-ahead influences while adhering to
his fusion agenda.
 &HT;    Shipp, 39, is a key player on the New York jazz scene and among
the more audacious artists on the music's edge. Not only has he
recorded well-regarded albums under his own name, such as The
Multiplication Table and DNA, but he has also distinguished himself
in a quartet led by saxophonist David S. Ware. His new album,
Pastoral Composure, on the Thirsty Ear label, consolidates his
position while opening up unexpected possibilities. Shipp's
accompanists on the disc are trumpeter Roy Campbell, bassist
William Parker and drummer Gerald Cleaver. While longtime fans will
relish the Pianist's anarchic imagination and exploratory way with
a melody line, they may also be surprised by two tracks that are,
for Shipp, surprisingly straight-ahead.
 &HT;    ``I'm thought of as being in the vanguard, but there are many
facets to where I've come from,'' Shipp says. ``Visions'' and
``Progression,'' the compositions in question, ``are still my
music, my language.'' The challenge in making the album was ``to
make it all work, so that it all seemed to be an outgrowth of my
musical vision and so that it all made sense within that context.''
 &HT;    Pastoral Composure is a milestone for Shipp in another way: It's
the first in a new line of jazz albums on Thirsty Ear, called The
Blue Series and to be produced by the pianist.
 &HT;    ``I couldn't really pass up the opportunity,'' said the
Wilmington, Del., native, who moved to New York in the '80s.
 &HT;    The urge to experiment, while also holding onto established
turf, is one that Alex Bugnon can probably appreciate. On ... As
Promised (Narada), the smooth-jazz favorite stays deep in the
groove, while also nodding to a bop vibe. With heavy-duty guest
stars like singer Angie Stone and saxophonist Branford Marsalis,
Bugnon maintains his reputation for reconciling jazz with funk.
 &HT;    Hill, 62, has been a jazz icon since releasing a series of
influential, classic recordings on Blue Note Records in the '60s.
Arguably, his masterpiece was Point of Departure, a 1964 album on
which he led a stellar ensemble that included saxophonists Joe
Henderson and Eric Dolphy. Blue Note recently reissued Grass Roots,
a fine recording with a hard-bop emphasis that features trumpeter
Lee Morgan and saxophonist Booker Ervin.
 &HT;    Hill's latest effort, Dusk, on the Palmetto label, proves that
the pianist's touch and talent are very much intact. Whether he's
tossing off pointillistic solos on the title track or romping
through the wildly boppish ``Ball Square,'' Hill singularly
investigates the possibilities of musical space, and pushes
harmonic and melodic limits. It doesn't hurt that the band on Dusk
_ including saxophonists Greg Tardy and Marty Ehrlich, trumpeter
Ron Horton, bassist Scott Colley and drummer Billy Drummond _ has
been Hill's working group for more than two years.
 &HT;    ``We got together and rehearsed twice a week, without any job or
money,'' the pianist says. ``Which is a rare situation for New York
City.''
 &HT;    When the combo started playing in clubs, the strong audience
response was gratifying. In fact, it reminded him of his early days
as a player in his hometown Chicago, when he served as sideman to
such luminaries as Charlie Parker and Miles Davis.
 &HT;    ``There were jazz clubs that New York musicians used to come
through,'' Hill says. ``And growing up in Chicago, you had so many
great, unknown artists that were never recorded.''
 &HT;    It was through playing alongside such masters that the pianist
found his own voice _ and his own path. Indeed, Shipp cites Hill as
one of his idols.
 &HT;    ``His Blue Note albums are a world unto themselves,'' Shipp
says. ``Modernistic and futuristic in their general thrust, but at
the same time, very rooted in the piano jazz tradition.''
 &HT;    Which also happens to be an apt description of Shipp's own
music.

SOFTENING THE GOP

 By JAMES E. GARCIA  
 &HT;    The GOP is making headway with Latino voters these days. That's
undeniable. But more than a few Latino politicos will tell you this
is inherently bad.
 &HT;    If you are a ``Latino Republican,'' they say, you are a
``vendido,'' a sell out. Maybe, maybe not.
 &HT;    Those who know me count me among the crowd far to the left of
George W. Bush and company. It's a fair assessment. I'm even to the
left of Bill Clinton and company. In other words, the GOP won't be
signing me up anytime soon.
 &HT;    Having said that, I do see a silver lining in the shift of many
Latinos to the GOP's ranks.
 &HT;    Although the polls don't articulate this, I believe that if
there is such a thing as a kinder, gentler ``21st Century
Republican Party,'' as one conservative pundit recently described
it, then it's epitomized by its newest recruits _ Latinos.
 &HT;    The good news for the Latino community is that the Latinos who
are joining the GOP are having a moderating affect on the party.
When Latino Republicans say, ``George W. Bush is not Pete Wilson,''
they mean, ``Don't expect me to stick with this party if it starts
to bash immigrants.''
 &HT;    If Latino Republicans say, ``Let's give school vouchers a
chance,'' they more often than not mean, ``Let's find a way to
improve the quality of low-performing schools that aren't doing a
very good job of teaching our children what they need to know.''
 &HT;    Latino Republicans, along with suburban white women and
Independents, are putting the ``compassion'' into ``compassionate
conservatism'' _ not Bush.
 &HT;    For the past few years, the GOP has been working feverishly to
convince swing voters that they're really not that mean. Time and
again, Latino Republicans will tell you that George W. Bush is
nothing like ex-California Gov. Pete Wilson, the Genghis Khan of
the GOP's scorched-earth, anti-immigrant crusades of the 1990s.
 &HT;    True, Wilson's strategy of blaming his state's economic woes on
powerless immigrants, namely Latino immigrants, did get him
re-elected in 1994. But it also made Latinos angry.
 &HT;    And the community got angrier when Newt Gingrich and company
followed up on the Wilsonian Principle _ that is, inspire your core
constituency by demonizing the weak _ and passed a slew of
punitive, anti-immigrant and anti-poor measures in Congress. (It's
worth noting that President Clinton didn't do much to block the
Republican onslaught. He was looking to get re-elected in 1996.)
 &HT;    But the Republicans backed off as soon as they realized that an
angry Latino constituency is an active Latino constituency.
Wilson's willingness to bash Latino immigrants inspired hundreds of
thousands, perhaps millions, of Latinos to register to vote. And
vote they did _ for Democrats.
 &HT;    In 1996, more than 70 percent of Latino voters backed Clinton's
re-election. And Latinos voted again in droves for Democratic
candidates during the 1998 elections.
 &HT;    Now fast-forward to Campaign 2000: Bush and Gore are locked in a
neck-and-neck race for the presidency. Both know they'll need every
swing vote to win in November. And Latino voters are a vital part
of that equation.
 &HT;    There are other dynamics at work. Latinos of voting age have
reached critical numbers. Even a moderate election-day turnout
among Latino voters could make a difference in a close race.
Illinois and Florida quickly come to mind. There also are important
state and federal legislative races to consider.
 &HT;    For the Republicans, the good news is that the Latino community
has a burgeoning middle class whose social and cultural values are
mostly conservative.
 &HT;    But like any true hierarchy, it's the managers who make the
decisions. And without flexing their political and economic clout,
Latinos will never gain enough power in Democratic or Republican
circles to assume the powerbroker roles.
 &HT;    So, ``Latino Republicans'' can be a good thing. If nothing else,
they show the Democrats that Latino votes cannot be taken for
granted. Latino Independents or Green Party members would move the
community a step further.
 &HT;    In the end, public policy should be based on what is good for
the public at large _ all of the public. The guiding moral
principle of this nation should be people-ism, not liberalism or
conservatism.
 &HT;    If Latinos can moderate the Republican Party, humanize it, make
it truly more compassionate than it has been, then our community _
and the nation as a whole _ will be better off.

 Excerpted from KoreAm Journal  
 &HT;    ``Happy Father's Day, Dad!'' I said.
 &HT;    ``Thanks, Son.''
 &HT;    ``What time is it there in Korea?'' I asked.
 &HT;    ``Oh, about 12:30 a.m.''
 &HT;    ``Oops, sorry about that.''
 &HT;    ``That's OK,'' he said. ``Thank you for calling!''
 &HT;    ``How is it over there? Is everybody excited about the North and
South Korean Summit?''
 &HT;    ``Well, a little. But there's still a long way to go.''
 &HT;    That was the extent of my in-depth investigative journalism into
the historical meeting between the two Kims of our divided
motherland.
 &HT;    My father, who still lives in South Korea, has seen a lot.
Political posturing does not easily impress him. And though he
sounded positive about this recent turn of events, he still
remains, for the most part, largely guarded in his optimism, as do
I.
 &HT;    As it stands, South Korea is at a stage where Japan was back in
the late 1960s and early 1970s. Think about it. Rapidly growing
technological and manufacturing prowess combined with (relatively)
cheap labor have given South Korean companies the power to make
inroads into the worldwide market.
 &HT;    But it needs a boost _ a boost that can come from the North.
 &HT;    A massive infusion of super-cheap labor that, most importantly,
speaks the same language can bequeath unto South Korean companies
with existing international trade and distribution channels the
wherewithal to severely undercut its global competitors. How about
a Hyundai Tiburon for $5,000? Or a Goldstar 13-inch TV/VCR combo
set for $50?
 &HT;    Is this really big news? Or is this just a lot of hot air from
both sides of the 38th Parallel? Could this really spell the end of
tension between two forces at odds for half a century? Or are the
two Kims simply pandering to their own personal agendas?
 &HT;    Only time will tell. And only one thing is for certain: Nothing
definitive has been hammered out.
 &HT;    Oh sure, the recently signed agreement mentions the reuniting of
families separated during the war. But it doesn't mention how many
and when.
 &HT;    And if you read between the lines of the agreement, you see that
the path to reunification will not be an easy one. Both sides have
their own ideas of how North and South should become one. The
agreement essentially states that both sides agree to disagree on
that issue. It will be interesting to see how that works out. The
U.S. government has the same stance.
 &HT;    While lifting many 50-year-old economic sanctions and embargoes
against North Korea, the United States, like my father, is
tempering its enthusiasm with caution. Changing North Korea's
``rogue nation'' status to that of a ``state of concern'' is about
as far as Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was willing to go.
 &HT;    President Clinton, himself, sent the message that as long as
North Korea maintained its moratorium on its missile-testing
program, things would progress toward the positive.
 &HT;    So, is this really big news? You bet it is. Is reunification
just around the corner? No way.
 &HT;    My Korean side yearns for the two Koreas to become one and is
elated at the prospect. But the American in me is skeptical of the
show of friendship and doubtful of the Stalinist state's
intentions. So, like Dad, I too am feeling guarded enthusiasm.

NATIVE AMERICAN MUSIC DESERVES IT'S OWN GRAMMY CATEGORY  
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  ATTENTION EDITORS: The following material from The New York Times

 &HT;    
 By KAREN LINCOLN MICHEL  
 &HT;    My 80-year-old mother sings a song in our native language in
which she thanks Earthmaker for her life. She is a stroke victim
suffering from diabetes, heart disease and dementia, yet she looks
beyond her pain to honor the gift of life through song.
 &HT;    Dementia has robbed her of most of her memories, but she
recognizes certain songs. Among her favorite pastimes is listening
to American Indian powwow music and songs of the Native American
Church.
 &HT;    Their words often speak of simple, but potent messages. Some say
they have the power to heal. For my mother, they reconnect her to
her past.
 &HT;    In song, Mom carries on a musical tradition indigenous to this
country. The first songs heard in this part of creation were sung
by native voices like my mother's. So when the National Academy of
Recording Arts and Sciences decided recently to add a Native
American category to the Grammy Awards lineup next year, it struck
a chord with me. Finally, our beautiful songs will receive long
overdue recognition from the mainstream.
 &HT;    There's a big glitch, though. The academy created only one
category, which is best Native American Music Album.
 &HT;    That's similar to having a single award for Latin music, which,
by the way, has grown so large that the Grammys created a spin-off
award show. The ``First Annual Latin Grammy Awards'' is slated to
take place in September with 40 award categories.
 &HT;    It's going to be extremely difficult to find the best Native
American recording when you consider the category also includes
contemporary native music, a growing genre in recent years.
 &HT;    Contemporary versus traditional poses a big dilemma. How can you
compare a political protest song sung in English to a traditional
honor song in memory of tribal warriors? It's an apples-to-oranges
comparison.
 &HT;    At the very least, the recording academy ought to offer one
award for each type of native music.
 &HT;    In its broadest terms, traditional native music falls into two
areas. There are social songs, the kind sung around the powwow drum
and hand-held drums, and spiritual music, including the songs my
mother sings.
 &HT;    Each has its own distinctive style and origin as varied as the
557 American Indian and Alaska Native tribes officially recognized
by the U.S. government.
 &HT;    The same could be said of contemporary native musicians, whose
English lyrics speak of tribal perspectives on life and world
events.
 &HT;    A spokesman for the Grammys said it's going to take time to iron
out the wrinkles. A committee of Native American music experts is
being assembled to ensure that native music is categorized
properly.
 &HT;    For instance, a recording by the blues band Indigenous would be
judged as a blues album and not under the new category. That's
because the category recognizes and celebrates the music of Native
America _ not Native American musicians who may be performing a
mainstream genre of music.
 &HT;    It's a little strange that the new award falls under the folk
music field. When I think of folk music, performers such as Woody
Guthrie and Pete Seeger come to mind.
 &HT;    I can't imagine a native performer singing the folk classic,
``This Land is Your Land.'' Well, maybe if it were called, ``This
Land is My Land, This Land's not Your Land.''
 &HT;    I would argue that native music deserves a category all its own,
based on the definition of folk music widely accepted. The
academy's Web site links to a guide that defined folk music as that
which is ``composed and performed by amateurs and passed down in an
oral tradition devoid of formal training.''
 &HT;    Most native people I know who sing traditional songs learned
from their elders and practiced their craft for years.
 &HT;    My nephews have a traditional Ho-Chunk drum group called the
Thundercloud Singers. They grew up around the drum and learned the
songs from their Ho-Chunk relatives. Some of the old-timers are no
longer with us, and I know my nephews remember them when they sing
certain songs.
 &HT;    I consider their tutelage formal training.
 &HT;    The electronic music guide goes on to say that folk music may
also be considered the rural blues of the Mississippi Delta and the
drum-heavy music of northwestern Africa, ``not to mention any other
tribal or traditional genres.''
 &HT;    And they weren't mentioned _ for the longest time.
 &HT;    But thanks to a group of Native American musicians who pushed
for the new category, tribal genres will be recognized in 2001.
 &HT;    For all the potential problems in lumping together native music
into a single category, I'm glad the Grammy Awards will recognize
our music. It's a start.
 &HT;    Maybe it will give a larger audience to the kind of beautiful
songs my mother sings.

NORTEL ACQUIRES ALTEON FOR $7.8 BILLION IN STOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Nortel Networks Corp. of Canada continued its push to become
a major developer of Internet systems on Friday as it announced
that it had agreed to acquire Alteon WebSystems Inc. for $7.8
billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Alteon, based in San Jose, Calif., makes equipment that allows
Internet servers _ the computers that hold information on the Web _
to perform more efficiently. Alteon's gear splits up requests for
Internet information among a company's individual servers, allowing
them to perform more efficiently, and can spare them the burden of
performing routine electronic tasks such as encryption.
</P>
<P>
   The value of such a product is reflected in the move by Cisco
Systems Inc., the No. 1 maker of Internet equipment, to acquire
Alteon's main competitor, ArrowPoint Communications, based in
Acton, Mass., for $5.7 billion in May. At the time, that deal was
seen by some communications analysts as a negative for Alteon. With
Cisco's acquisition of ArrowPoint, the argument went, it would be
tougher for Alteon to sell itself.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, it was not that tough. North America's three big makers
of communications equipment, Cisco, Lucent Technologies Inc. and
Nortel, are engaged in a furious battle to dominate the market for
the next generation of communications technology, and the sort of
gear made by Alteon fits that bill perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   For the next few years, there will probably be three major
``sweet spots'' in the communications equipment market _ wireless
systems that can transport Internet data, optical systems that can
transmit billions of bits of information, and advanced data
networking equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Alteon fits into the third category, one that Cisco, Lucent and
Nortel are approaching from different directions.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco's roots are in the sale of data communications equipment
to corporate customers for office networks. Now that the corporate
market is largely mature, Cisco is furiously trying to reinvent
itself as a vendor to big international communications carriers,
whose technical requirements are far more complex and stringent
than those of everyday corporations. In Cisco's favor, however, is
its legacy of experience with data communications systems.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent and Nortel have exactly the opposite problem. For
decades, those two companies have been meeting the requirements of
the world's biggest carriers, but mostly by providing systems for
voice telephone calls. Only over the last few years have Lucent and
Nortel made significant strides in data networking.
</P>
<P>
   A company like Alteon can jump-start that effort, not least
because it already has significant customers and partners,
including Akamai Technologies Inc., which helps transmit electronic
``content'' on the Web. Unlike many of the start-up optical
communications companies that are being snapped up these days for
billions of dollars, Alteon has revenue _ $110 million in its most
recent fiscal year, which ended in June.
</P>
<P>
   The Alteon deal is Nortel's biggest acquisition since it
acquired Bay Networks Inc. for $9.1 billion in 1998. Under Friday's
agreement, Alteon's stock owners are to receive 1.83148 shares of
Nortel for each of their Alteon shares. Based on Nortel's closing
price Thursday of $78.625, the deal is worth $144 for each Alteon
share, $1 more than Alteon's closing price Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, shares of Nortel fell $5.50 to $73 amid a broad stock
market sell-off. Shares of Alteon closed at $129, down $14.

 By CALVIN WILSON  
 &HT;    Among the many charms of jazz is its questing nature. By
definition, the music is ever on a journey of discovery, with
performers taking new detours as listeners keep their ears attuned
to every turn.
 &HT;    But as in any art form, it's impossible to move ahead without
properly appreciating what's been done. And just as the recent work
of Wynton Marsalis is largely influenced by Duke Ellington, more
experimental jazz artists also have roots in the past.
 &HT;    Pianists Matthew Shipp and Andrew Hill, not only point to
predecessors who inspired them, but also continue to set standards
of their own. Frequently their music has been unencumbered by chord
changes, but so passionate are their compositions and performances
that questions of accessibility are more or less moot. Also on a
quest is keyboardist Alex Bugnon, who's back in the stores with a
new album that draws on straight-ahead influences while adhering to
his fusion agenda.
 &HT;    Shipp, 39, is a key player on the New York jazz scene and among
the more audacious artists on the music's edge. Not only has he
recorded well-regarded albums under his own name, such as The
Multiplication Table and DNA, but he has also distinguished himself
in a quartet led by saxophonist David S. Ware. His new album,
Pastoral Composure, on the Thirsty Ear label, consolidates his
position while opening up unexpected possibilities. Shipp's
accompanists on the disc are trumpeter Roy Campbell, bassist
William Parker and drummer Gerald Cleaver. While longtime fans will
relish the Pianist's anarchic imagination and exploratory way with
a melody line, they may also be surprised by two tracks that are,
for Shipp, surprisingly straight-ahead.
 &HT;    ``I'm thought of as being in the vanguard, but there are many
facets to where I've come from,'' Shipp says. ``Visions'' and
``Progression,'' the compositions in question, ``are still my
music, my language.'' The challenge in making the album was ``to
make it all work, so that it all seemed to be an outgrowth of my
musical vision and so that it all made sense within that context.''
 &HT;    Pastoral Composure is a milestone for Shipp in another way: It's
the first in a new line of jazz albums on Thirsty Ear, called The
Blue Series and to be produced by the pianist.
 &HT;    ``I couldn't really pass up the opportunity,'' said the
Wilmington, Del., native, who moved to New York in the '80s.
 &HT;    The urge to experiment, while also holding onto established
turf, is one that Alex Bugnon can probably appreciate. On ... As
Promised (Narada), the smooth-jazz favorite stays deep in the
groove, while also nodding to a bop vibe. With heavy-duty guest
stars like singer Angie Stone and saxophonist Branford Marsalis,
Bugnon maintains his reputation for reconciling jazz with funk.
 &HT;    Hill, 62, has been a jazz icon since releasing a series of
influential, classic recordings on Blue Note Records in the '60s.
Arguably, his masterpiece was Point of Departure, a 1964 album on
which he led a stellar ensemble that included saxophonists Joe
Henderson and Eric Dolphy. Blue Note recently reissued Grass Roots,
a fine recording with a hard-bop emphasis that features trumpeter
Lee Morgan and saxophonist Booker Ervin.
 &HT;    Hill's latest effort, Dusk, on the Palmetto label, proves that
the pianist's touch and talent are very much intact. Whether he's
tossing off pointillistic solos on the title track or romping
through the wildly boppish ``Ball Square,'' Hill singularly
investigates the possibilities of musical space, and pushes
harmonic and melodic limits. It doesn't hurt that the band on Dusk
_ including saxophonists Greg Tardy and Marty Ehrlich, trumpeter
Ron Horton, bassist Scott Colley and drummer Billy Drummond _ has
been Hill's working group for more than two years.
 &HT;    ``We got together and rehearsed twice a week, without any job or
money,'' the pianist says. ``Which is a rare situation for New York
City.''
 &HT;    When the combo started playing in clubs, the strong audience
response was gratifying. In fact, it reminded him of his early days
as a player in his hometown Chicago, when he served as sideman to
such luminaries as Charlie Parker and Miles Davis.
 &HT;    ``There were jazz clubs that New York musicians used to come
through,'' Hill says. ``And growing up in Chicago, you had so many
great, unknown artists that were never recorded.''
 &HT;    It was through playing alongside such masters that the pianist
found his own voice _ and his own path. Indeed, Shipp cites Hill as
one of his idols.
 &HT;    ``His Blue Note albums are a world unto themselves,'' Shipp
says. ``Modernistic and futuristic in their general thrust, but at
the same time, very rooted in the piano jazz tradition.''
 &HT;    Which also happens to be an apt description of Shipp's own
music.

 By JAMES E. GARCIA  
 &HT;    The GOP is making headway with Latino voters these days. That's
undeniable. But more than a few Latino politicos will tell you this
is inherently bad.
 &HT;    If you are a ``Latino Republican,'' they say, you are a
``vendido,'' a sell out. Maybe, maybe not.
 &HT;    Those who know me count me among the crowd far to the left of
George W. Bush and company. It's a fair assessment. I'm even to the
left of Bill Clinton and company. In other words, the GOP won't be
signing me up anytime soon.
 &HT;    Having said that, I do see a silver lining in the shift of many
Latinos to the GOP's ranks.
 &HT;    Although the polls don't articulate this, I believe that if
there is such a thing as a kinder, gentler ``21st Century
Republican Party,'' as one conservative pundit recently described
it, then it's epitomized by its newest recruits _ Latinos.
 &HT;    The good news for the Latino community is that the Latinos who
are joining the GOP are having a moderating affect on the party.
When Latino Republicans say, ``George W. Bush is not Pete Wilson,''
they mean, ``Don't expect me to stick with this party if it starts
to bash immigrants.''
 &HT;    If Latino Republicans say, ``Let's give school vouchers a
chance,'' they more often than not mean, ``Let's find a way to
improve the quality of low-performing schools that aren't doing a
very good job of teaching our children what they need to know.''
 &HT;    Latino Republicans, along with suburban white women and
Independents, are putting the ``compassion'' into ``compassionate
conservatism'' _ not Bush.
 &HT;    For the past few years, the GOP has been working feverishly to
convince swing voters that they're really not that mean. Time and
again, Latino Republicans will tell you that George W. Bush is
nothing like ex-California Gov. Pete Wilson, the Genghis Khan of
the GOP's scorched-earth, anti-immigrant crusades of the 1990s.
 &HT;    True, Wilson's strategy of blaming his state's economic woes on
powerless immigrants, namely Latino immigrants, did get him
re-elected in 1994. But it also made Latinos angry.
 &HT;    And the community got angrier when Newt Gingrich and company
followed up on the Wilsonian Principle _ that is, inspire your core
constituency by demonizing the weak _ and passed a slew of
punitive, anti-immigrant and anti-poor measures in Congress. (It's
worth noting that President Clinton didn't do much to block the
Republican onslaught. He was looking to get re-elected in 1996.)
 &HT;    But the Republicans backed off as soon as they realized that an
angry Latino constituency is an active Latino constituency.
Wilson's willingness to bash Latino immigrants inspired hundreds of
thousands, perhaps millions, of Latinos to register to vote. And
vote they did _ for Democrats.
 &HT;    In 1996, more than 70 percent of Latino voters backed Clinton's
re-election. And Latinos voted again in droves for Democratic
candidates during the 1998 elections.
 &HT;    Now fast-forward to Campaign 2000: Bush and Gore are locked in a
neck-and-neck race for the presidency. Both know they'll need every
swing vote to win in November. And Latino voters are a vital part
of that equation.
 &HT;    There are other dynamics at work. Latinos of voting age have
reached critical numbers. Even a moderate election-day turnout
among Latino voters could make a difference in a close race.
Illinois and Florida quickly come to mind. There also are important
state and federal legislative races to consider.
 &HT;    For the Republicans, the good news is that the Latino community
has a burgeoning middle class whose social and cultural values are
mostly conservative.
 &HT;    But like any true hierarchy, it's the managers who make the
decisions. And without flexing their political and economic clout,
Latinos will never gain enough power in Democratic or Republican
circles to assume the powerbroker roles.
 &HT;    So, ``Latino Republicans'' can be a good thing. If nothing else,
they show the Democrats that Latino votes cannot be taken for
granted. Latino Independents or Green Party members would move the
community a step further.
 &HT;    In the end, public policy should be based on what is good for
the public at large _ all of the public. The guiding moral
principle of this nation should be people-ism, not liberalism or
conservatism.
 &HT;    If Latinos can moderate the Republican Party, humanize it, make
it truly more compassionate than it has been, then our community _
and the nation as a whole _ will be better off.

 Excerpted from KoreAm Journal  
 &HT;    ``Happy Father's Day, Dad!'' I said.
 &HT;    ``Thanks, Son.''
 &HT;    ``What time is it there in Korea?'' I asked.
 &HT;    ``Oh, about 12:30 a.m.''
 &HT;    ``Oops, sorry about that.''
 &HT;    ``That's OK,'' he said. ``Thank you for calling!''
 &HT;    ``How is it over there? Is everybody excited about the North and
South Korean Summit?''
 &HT;    ``Well, a little. But there's still a long way to go.''
 &HT;    That was the extent of my in-depth investigative journalism into
the historical meeting between the two Kims of our divided
motherland.
 &HT;    My father, who still lives in South Korea, has seen a lot.
Political posturing does not easily impress him. And though he
sounded positive about this recent turn of events, he still
remains, for the most part, largely guarded in his optimism, as do
I.
 &HT;    As it stands, South Korea is at a stage where Japan was back in
the late 1960s and early 1970s. Think about it. Rapidly growing
technological and manufacturing prowess combined with (relatively)
cheap labor have given South Korean companies the power to make
inroads into the worldwide market.
 &HT;    But it needs a boost _ a boost that can come from the North.
 &HT;    A massive infusion of super-cheap labor that, most importantly,
speaks the same language can bequeath unto South Korean companies
with existing international trade and distribution channels the
wherewithal to severely undercut its global competitors. How about
a Hyundai Tiburon for $5,000? Or a Goldstar 13-inch TV/VCR combo
set for $50?
 &HT;    Is this really big news? Or is this just a lot of hot air from
both sides of the 38th Parallel? Could this really spell the end of
tension between two forces at odds for half a century? Or are the
two Kims simply pandering to their own personal agendas?
 &HT;    Only time will tell. And only one thing is for certain: Nothing
definitive has been hammered out.
 &HT;    Oh sure, the recently signed agreement mentions the reuniting of
families separated during the war. But it doesn't mention how many
and when.
 &HT;    And if you read between the lines of the agreement, you see that
the path to reunification will not be an easy one. Both sides have
their own ideas of how North and South should become one. The
agreement essentially states that both sides agree to disagree on
that issue. It will be interesting to see how that works out. The
U.S. government has the same stance.
 &HT;    While lifting many 50-year-old economic sanctions and embargoes
against North Korea, the United States, like my father, is
tempering its enthusiasm with caution. Changing North Korea's
``rogue nation'' status to that of a ``state of concern'' is about
as far as Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was willing to go.
 &HT;    President Clinton, himself, sent the message that as long as
North Korea maintained its moratorium on its missile-testing
program, things would progress toward the positive.
 &HT;    So, is this really big news? You bet it is. Is reunification
just around the corner? No way.
 &HT;    My Korean side yearns for the two Koreas to become one and is
elated at the prospect. But the American in me is skeptical of the
show of friendship and doubtful of the Stalinist state's
intentions. So, like Dad, I too am feeling guarded enthusiasm.

SOUPED UP FOR SUMMER: WHETHER YOU SERVE IT FOR DESSERT _ OR
BREAKFAST _ FRUIT SOUPS ARE COOL. 
</HEADLINE>
 FRUITSOUP KANSAS -KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 JILL WENDHOLT SILVA  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   August is a soupy month. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But relief from the humid, sticky weather is only a bowl of
chilled fruit soup away. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (fruit soups) are a terrific idea,'' says executive
chef Tim Doolittle, who used to offer a melon soup with sorbet on
the Stolen Grill's menu. Unfortunately, it didn't sell well, in
part, Doolittle thinks, because it was less mainstream than the
other desserts served at the Westport restaurant. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But if the idea of fruit soup seems odd, simply recall the
sticky-sweet juice of a perfectly ripe peach as it dribbles down
your chin, spills through your fingers and trickles down to your
elbows. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are two basic ways to capture the essence of fruit in a
bowl. The first is to simply puree the ripest summer produce and
thicken with a little yogurt, cream or buttermilk. The other way is
to make a ``broth,'' usually a simple sugar syrup, and float sliced
fruit in it the same way vegetables bob in a chunky minestrone. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most fruit soups can be made a day in advance, then served as a
starter, an intermezzo (a breather between courses) or a light
dessert. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And if you really want to be cool, ditch the Wheaties and wake
up to a bowl of fruit soup. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an awesome breakfast with some granola,'' Doolittle
says. &QL; 
 &QL; 
A rather lengthy restaurant-style recipe, this Asian-inspired soup
is a stunning end to any summer meal. But if the recipe calls for
more energy than you're willing to expend, skip the homemade ice
cream and the meringues (which tend to wilt in the humidity), and
serve it with store-bought sorbet and cookies instead. &QL; 
 &LR; recipe:Tropical fruit soup with coconut sherbet and coconut
meringue &QL; 
 &LR; serv:Makes 4 servings &QL; 
 &LR; ingred:Coconut sherbet: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 cups milk &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar &QL;
</P>
<P>
   vanilla bean, split &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of salt &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 cups unsweetened dried coconut, toasted &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3 egg whites, optional &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Soup base: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 cups water &QL;
</P>
<P>
   cup sugar &QL;
</P>
<P>
   cinnamon stick &QL;
</P>
<P>
   star anise &QL;
</P>
<P>
   8 whole cloves &QL;
</P>
<P>
   8 black peppercorns &QL;
</P>
<P>
   vanilla bean &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Zest of 2 oranges, peeled or grated &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 pieces lemongrass, 2 inches long, sliced (use the white part
from the root end) (see note) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 thin slices fresh ginger &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon dark rum &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meringue: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 egg white, at room temperature &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of salt &QL;
</P>
<P>
   cup sugar &QL;
</P>
<P>
   cup unsweetened dried coconut &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fruit for soup: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About 2 cups tropical fruits: any combination of peeled and
sliced pineapple, mango, papaya, kiwi, bananas; halved litchis,
sliced kumquats and strawberries; passion fruit pulp; and orange
segments &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fresh mint, for garnish &QL; 
 &LR; tx:To make sherbet: Warm the milk and sugar. Add the vanilla bean,
salt and the toasted coconut, cover, and steep 1 hour. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pour the mixture into a strainer set over a bowl. Remove the
vanilla bean. Squeeze the coconut to extract all the flavor, and
discard it. Chill the strained mixture until ready to freeze. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before freezing, whip the egg whites until they stand in soft
peaks and fold them into the coconut-flavored milk. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Freeze in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's
instructions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To make soup base: Bring the water and sugar to a boil.
Meanwhile, coarsely crush the cinnamon, star anise, cloves and
black peppercorns in a mortar, or put them in a plastic bag and
crush them with a rolling pin or a hammer. Add the spices to the
boiling syrup, turn off the heat, and add the vanilla bean, orange
zest, lemongrass and ginger. Cover the pan and steep 1 hour or
more. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Strain the soup base and discard the flavorings. Add the rum and
chill thoroughly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To make the meringue: Preheat oven to 250 degrees. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whip the egg white with the salt slowly until it is frothy, then
increase your speed, whisking until the white stands in firm but
drooping peaks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Continue to whip the whites as you sprinkle the sugar over them.
Keep whipping until all the sugar has been added and the meringue
is stiff and shiny. Fold in the coconut. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spread the coconut meringue into a very thin layer on a
parchment-lined baking sheet, ideally with an offset metal spatula.
The meringue should measure about 10 by 13 inches, spread quite
thinly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bake 10 minutes, or until deep golden brown. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the meringue is cooled completely, lift it off the baking
sheet, still attached to the paper, and carefully turn it over.
Hold the sheet of meringue in place as you gently peel the
parchment from the back of the meringue. If you try to lift the
meringue away from the paper, it can break into little pieces;
instead, you must pull the paper away from the meringue. Break the
meringue into large shards and store them in an airtight container
until you assemble the dessert. (They will keep for up to a week.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To assemble the soup: Toss all the prepared fruits together in a
bowl. Taste for sweetness, and add a sprinkling of sugar if they
are too tart. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Presentation: Divide the fruit into four wide soup bowls, and
ladle the chilled soup base over them. Tear some mint leaves into
tiny pieces, and scatter them over the soup. You may also serve
with a scoop of ice cream and stick a cookie in it. &QL;

SIDE:Cool answers to soupy questions &QL; 
 &QL; 
By JILL SILVA So when is a fruit soup /{not/} a melted sorbet? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When it's been thickened. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Read on for more cool answers to soupy questions: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   {Slick and thick:} If your soup needs a bit more body, you can
swirl in cream, half-and-half or yogurt. But Crescent Dragonwagon,
former innkeeper at the Dairy Hollow House in Eureka Springs, Ark.,
and the author of /{Dairy Hollow House Soup &AMP; Bread/} (Workman),
prefers cornstarch, which is fat-free and gives fruit soups a
``lovely, jewellike high-gloss sheen.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   {Method:} Combine cornstarch with a small part of the liquid
called for in a recipe (wine, juice, broth), and mush the starch
into the liquid with your fingertips until there are no lumps. The
cornstarch will settle into a paste at the bottom of the glass.
After you've brought the liquid in the recipe to a boil and back to
a simmer, pour the dissolved cornstarch mixture into the ``broth''
and whisk a few times to incorporate quickly. Stir with a spoon and
wait for it to thicken. The amount of time it takes to thicken
depends on the type of fruit used. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   {Thin it down:} If your fruit soup is too thick, Memphis-based
chef Raji Jallepelli, author of /{Raji Cuisine/} (HarperCollins),
suggests adding a bit of sparkle with seltzer. Or, for a kick, add
a sparkling or dessert wine, such as Sauternes, or a sweetish wine,
such as Gurwurtztraminer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   {Flavor boosters:} Searching for a way to pump up the flavor in
fruit soups, Chicago chef Gail Gand, co-author of /{Butter, Flour,
Sugar/} (Potter), decided she needed to find the ``dessert
equivalent of soup stock.'' She uses herbal teas such as chamomile,
jasmine, lemon verbena or rose hip, to thin fruit soups and add a
depth of flavor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   {Save the pits:} New York chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten, author
of /{Jean-Georges: Four-Star Cooking at Home/} (Broadway), offers
an unusual method of adding depth of flavor to his recipe for Soup
of Red Fruits. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vongerichten's recipe (see accompanying story) ``begins with the
unusual step of making a `stock' from crushed cherry pits, a
worthwhile and not at all difficult exercise, which lends a
distinct bitter-almond flavor to the finished product.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   {Sweeten the pot:} If the fruit is too tart, Dragonwagon adds
honey, maple syrup or undiluted frozen fruit juice concentrate
instead of sugar, which can overpower the soup. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   {Smooth move:} Dragonwagon advises using a strainer to remove
seeds or fibrous pulp for any fruit that would ``mar a smooth,
soulful texture.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   {Quick fix:} Sean Cummings, executive chef of the Grille on
Broadway in Kansas City, shares tips for two quick fruit soups: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To make Watermelon Soup: Puree watermelon, strain, add a bit of
lemon juice and serve. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To make Exotic Fruit Soup: Cut up any exotic fruit, such as
starfruit, pineapple, mango, papaya or kiwi. Fill soup bowl halfway
with the fruit, add coconut milk and garnish with fresh mint. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   {Embellishments:} Sorbets and sherbets make a nice, light
garnish for any fruit soup. You can even stick a biscotti, meringue
or other cookie in the ice cream. Or try bite-size poundcake
``croutons'' for a creative presentation. For an elegant dessert
presentation, add a dollop of whipped cream. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   {Minty fresh:} Use the most pristine mint you can find. Add a
sprig or tear small pieces and add it to the soup. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   {On the rocks:} The key to enjoying summer fruit soups is to
keep them cool. Float several ice cubes in the soup or pour a bit
of the soup into ice cube trays and serve instead of ice cubes,
thereby avoiding diluting the soup. &QL;

 &HT;    Let the music play _ Napster gets a stay
 &HT;    By Bob Keefe
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO - The music will go on at Napster Inc. _ at least
temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court Friday granted the online music company
a stay of an injuction that would have shut the company's popular
_and controversial _ Web site down at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   A two-judge panel ruled that Napster raised ``substantial''
questions about the merits and need for the injunction. Napster has
until Aug. 18 to file an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The injunction was ordered earlier this week by a federal judge
in San Francisco after she found that Napster's service violated
record companies' copyrights. She ordered the company to quit
letting visitors to its site swap music files that reside on their
own computers using Napster's file-sharing programs, which Napster
claimed would cause an entire shutdown of its business. The
injunction stemmed from a suit filed by the record company
tradegroup Recording Industry Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   As Napster's legal fight with the recording industry continues,
another online music company is making nice.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com Inc. has agreed to pay royalties and cash to settle a
copyright lawsuit filed by EMI Group in what MP3 officials
described as a sign of the online music industry's future.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the settlement were not made public, but reportedly
call for MP3.com to pay $20 million up front and royalties each
time an EMI-labeled song is downloaded from MP3.com's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``A business model where artists, copyright holders and record
companies can potentially monetize their music digitally . . . is
finally emerging,'' MP3.com Chairman Michael Robertson said in a
prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   It is the third such suit that San Diego-based MP3 has settled
since a federal judge in April ruled that the company violated
record companies' copyrights. It is still negotiating settlements
with two other record companies, Universal Music Group and Sony
Music Group.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courtroom, Napster showed signs Friday of warming up
to the recording industry too.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of encouraging a boycott of music companies and retail
stores that had been urged by tens of thousands of Napster fans
around the world, the Redwood City, Calif. company asked them to do
the opposite and buy CDs _ especially those of artists who favor of
Napster's file sharing program _ during a two-day ``buy-cott'' this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The ``buy-cott'' is aimed at bolstering Napster's argument that
its service actually encourages music listeners to buy music
instead of just taking it from free from other fans through
Napster's Web site.

CHAVEZ FACES VOTERS UNDER A CLOUD OF DOUBT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS _ He still wears his blood-red beret _ tilted slightly
to the right side _ while making an important speech. He still uses
his sing-song baritone voice to belt out damning descriptions of
the political elite he toppled 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Hugo Chavez and his Venezuela revolution have lost some
steam because the oil-based economy he promised to expand is
shrinking drastically, the crime he pledged to stop is even more
threatening than before and the corruption he pledged to eradicate
has infected his own office.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 46-year-old president _ and onetime coup plotter _
will likely retain his office after Sunday's general election, the
movement that swept him into power in 1998 appears weaker today.
There are growing frustrations among voters that he has become more
obsessed with authority than goverance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted for him the first time because I really believed he
would make life better for us,'' said Migdalia Sanchez, a
29-year-old beautician. ``And I have supported him since, but I'm
not sure this time. The economy hasn't improved and my country
feels less safe now than before.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez put himself and every other public official up for
re-election by ramming through a revised constitution for a country
of 23 million people. And if he succeeds in the vote, he will have
more power and more time to carry out his populist agenda, backed
by a majority in congress certain to rubber stamp all of Chavez's
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel-turned-president insists on blaming the country's
entrenched ``oligarchy'' for creating its economic and social
problems. Many of Venezuela's poor _ who make up 80 percent of the
country's population _ believe him, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   But the former paratrooper who once enjoyed 90 percent approval
ratings has seen his support drop by, according to some estimates,
as much as 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The country's economy, despite skyrocketing prices for
petroleum, contracted 7 percent in 1999 and lost about 600,000
jobs. Meanwhile, crime has soared throughout the country, where
according to one study, one in 40 Venezuelans is the victim of a
violent crime. Some experts warn time is running out for Chavez to
make good on his promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won on two platforms, bringing badly needed social change
and doing it with authority and discipline,'' said Roberto
Briceno-Leon, director of the Laboratory of Social Sciences, a
leading Venezuelan think-tank. ``His support among the poor may be
about the same, but he has certainly lost in the middle class.''
</P>
<P>
   That might explain why many of the country's educated and
affluent voters have turned to one of Chavez's former military
comrades, Francisco Arias, to unseat him.
</P>
<P>
   Arias, 49, who joined Chavez in an unsuccessful coup attempt
against the elected government in 1992 and once shared his
revolutionary vision, argues for toned-down reform and more
business-friendly policies. One Venezuelan journalist referred to
the former Zulia state governor as ``Chavez lite.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to call investors and tell them they are not
enemies because they have money,'' Arias told a crowd of 20,000
during his final rally on Wednesday. ``We're going to leave that
hate behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Arias's chances of beating Chavez are slim, although the
challenger predicts the race is closer than most people think.
Recent polls showed Chavez leading by 10 to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Arias' challenge, if nothing else, has shown cracks in
Chavez's political armor, particularly among former supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Soliders and officers who once pledged undying loyalty to Chavez
have grumbled over new tasks such as clearing trash from city
streets and repaving roads.
</P>
<P>
   Another Chavez 1992 coup member, Andres Urdaneta, quit as chief
of the country's top police unit in February and derided as corrupt
the president's two top aides _ Foreign Minister Jose Vicente
Rangel and socialist mentor Luis Miquelena.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, government officials said they had uncovered
plans of a plot by members of Venezuela's National Guard to
assassinate the president.
</P>
<P>
   There are also unresolved issues between Washington and the US's
largest oil supplier. The biggest problem continues to be Chavez's
refusal to allow US anti-narcotics jets to fly over Venezuelan
airspace into neighboring Colombia. More recently, Venezuelan
officials have criticized a contract awarded to a Texas firm to
build a satellite base in a the Essequibo region, an area at the
heart of a border dispute with Guyana.
</P>
<P>
   But the most important challenge facing Chavez is how to take
voters' dwindling support and re-ignite the fervor they once had
for his plans. Many Venezuelans, casting ballots for the sixth time
in less than two years, say they're tired of voting and would
rather see results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget soccer or baseball. Voting is our new national sport,''
said Freddy Espinosa, 51, a truck driver who says he's sticking
with Chavez. ``To be honest, I've had enough of elections. It's
time to start seeing some benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   The elections were originally scheduled for May 28 but were
postponed after problems with the vote-counting computer systems
and other irregularities. Ruben Perina, heading an Organization of
American States monitoring team, said Friday that all the problems
had been addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelan expert Richard Hillman, a political scientist at St.
John Fisher College in New York, urges others not to rush to judge
the Chavez presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``But people whose expectations have risen are now beginning to
say, `What about me?''' Hillman added. ``He still has a lot of
support, but he can't keep fighting those oligarchs. He's going to
have to start dealing with people's everyday issues.''

ORIGINS OF THE TWENTY-YEAR BOOM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 30, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the spotlight shifts to the Republican and Democratic
conventions, you can expect to hear a lot of guff about which was
better, the Eighties or the Nineties?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is neither, or so it seems to me. The decades were
two halves of an almost seamless boom, a case of success building
on the success that had its origins in a series of policy
initiatives beginning in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the tax-cutting, budget-balancing, free-trading and
other market-wise economic policies were perfect. In fact they
usually overshot. But each time the zig-zag of politics drove
policy back on the opposite tack, and with each subsequent
correction, the amplitude of the swings decreased.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been the best and longest boom in world history.
Household income has increased dramatically; so has wealth. Nor is
there reason to believe the distribution of wealth has changed very
much except at the very high end. (It's still unequal.)
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans deserve credit for blazing the ttrail. The
Democrats, at least under Bill Clinton, deserve credit for folowing
on. There is still plenty of disagreement about where to go next.
</P>
<P>
   Economists have only just begun to grope towards a consensus
about the hows and whys of the events of the last quarter century.
Many leaders of the current generation have been partisan
participants in events _ Martin Feldstein and Lawrence Lindsey for
the Republicans, Lawrence Summers and Martin Baily for the
Democrats, to name only those currently in the lists. Someone else
will have to give a persuasive accounting of developments in the
last quarter of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   From the vantage point of a newspaper desk, however, the current
stability seems to have to do with having escaped from the shadow
of events in the global economy during the 1920s and '30s.
</P>
<P>
   The Keynesian policies that dominated economics for nearly 50
years had their origins in the desperation of the Great Depression.
They were designed to prevent a recurrence of the momentous slump,
in which uemployment in the industrial democracies surged to 25
percent and remained there. They emphasized budget deficits as an
engine of growth, attached little significance to inflation, and
paid scant attention the the economic effects of taxation.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the macroeconomic dogma that has emerged since 1978
emphasizes price-level stability, lower and simpler taxes, a
balanced budget, and greater reliance on market forces than on
regulation. And, however irregularly implemented, these doctrines
have produced remarkable results.
</P>
<P>
   In America, the virtuous circle began with a series of capital
gains tax cuts in 1978. The next year President Jimmy Carter named
Paul Volcker chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and Volcker
immediately initiated an program of very tight money. The United
States tumbled into recession.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan, rather like Franklin D. Roosevelt, was elected
president in an atmosphere of crisis. And most of what has happened
since dates from the initiatives of his first year in office _ a
sequence of events hardly less galvanizing in its day than was the
New Deal in 1933. Personal income tax rates were cut drastically,
and a program of industrial deregulation and restructuring begun.
Volcker's monetary stringency went unchallenged.
</P>
<P>
   Did the vast Reagan military buildup have the effect of
bankrupting the Soviet Union? Who knows? Certainly the processes
that led to the collapse of the Soviet empire already were well
underway. The Berlin Wall fell in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   There can be no doubt, however, that the combination of tax cuts
and increased defense spending precipitated huge deficits and a
strong dollar, which threatened US industry. The Plaza agreement in
September 1985 signalled an attempt to redress international
imbalances, but the resulting strains led to the dramatic 1987
stock market break.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush, who oversaw the adminstration's response to the
crash, was elected the following year. Adroit monetary policy and
the Treasury Department's ``Brady bonds'' relief program for Third
World debt put world growth back on track. When the Iraqi invasion
of Kuwait threatened price stability, Bush responded with the Gulf
War and, on its eve, some rejiggering of taxes in order to achieve
a more nearly balanced budget. It (and a stubborn challenge by H.
Ross Perot) cost him the 1992 election.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton moved towards budget balancing in early 1993,
abandoning a wacky Keynesian plan to stimulate the economy in favor
of a hefty tax hike (which repudiated the Tax Simplification Act of
1985, one of the few bipartisan successes of the '80s). The result
was the beginning of luxuriant growth. Then Clinton's health care
initiative cost the Democrats leadership of the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   In the period that ensued of sharp maneuvering for advantage
between Bill Clinton and the GOP Congressional leadership, Clinton
became steward of most of the Republican agenda, its free trade
agenda in particular. The budget finally was balanced. Still more
bouyant growth was the result and, in due course, a substantial
surplus. A likely reversal of GOP dominance in the House was put in
train, with a massive redistricting due in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   With the election of 2000, another big problem of overshooting _
unacceptable political tactics _ seems likely to be brought under
control.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, with economic recovery well underway, the Democrats
campaigned against Ronald Reagan on the basis of ``the sleaze
factor'' and caractured his administration as the worst since
Harding. After his landslide re-election, Congressional Democrats
honed in on the Iran-Contra affair.
</P>
<P>
   A special counsel, Lawrence Walsh, pursued a president who
turned out to be slipping gradually into the early stages of
Alzheimer's Disease, while Republicans complained bitterly of the
``criminalization'' of ordinary political differences.
</P>
<P>
   After Bill Clinton was elected in 1992, Republicans and their
allies in the press took politics-by-investigation to new levels.
They hounded the president from the beginning of his term, first
with the various Whitewater investigations, then with impeachment
and trial over a sexual indiscretion, all the while blithely
justifying their conduct as turnabout-is-fair-play.
</P>
<P>
   Now George W. Bush has moved to quell the use of such demonizing
tactics with his selection of Dick Cheney as a running mate. Cheney
is a cautious conservative, with no taste for the wild hyperbole
that has infected Republican rhetoric in the the last 20 years. He
is no Kemp or Quayle or Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on Al Gore's choice of a vice-presidential candidate _
and the success of third party candidate Ralph Nader on the
hustings _ Cheney's presence on the Republican ticket could serve
to further sharpen voters' choice.
</P>
<P>
   Many differences remain between the parties. Many mysteries must
be resolved. But the moral for the next four years surely is steady
as she goes.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ When Russia began picking apart its economy in 1992,
Oleg Nasobin spotted an opportunity. After 70 years of Soviet
deficits, his country was brimming with pent-up demand for
lipstick, face creams and body lotion. It was a business
opportunity that he could take up only by leaving.
</P>
<P>
   That year, Nasobin packed his family off to Prague, in what was
then Czechoslovakia. He was looking to build a business on safe
ground, away from the constantly shifting turf of Russia's early
days of capitalism. He also was leaving his home _ the place that
would later make him a wealthy man.
</P>
<P>
   ``We left carrying two suitcases,'' said Nasobin, a 33-year-old
former peddler of ginseng. ``It was a very grim situation in Russia
in those days _ no personal prospects in sight.''
</P>
<P>
   Now his company, Green Mama, is one of Russia's top five
cosmetics producers. Since starting the company in the Czech
Republic in 1996, Nasobin and his wife, Irina, have expanded sales
to 36 countries including the United States and Canada, and employ
about 500 people.
</P>
<P>
   They later moved the factory to France and two years ago began
some production in Russia. The pair hit upon a winning recipe:
homegrown extracts with a made-in-France label that increased
allure in a market still curious about foreign goods.
</P>
<P>
   Imports flooded Russia's cosmetics market after the fall of
communism in 1991. Kiosks were crammed with deodorant, face cream
and shampoo with brightly colored English labels. Local residents,
starved for foreign brands, snapped up everything from detergent to
candy bars.
</P>
<P>
   But locally produced cosmetics have made a comeback since the
country's 1998 currency devaluation. The weaker ruble drove up the
price of imports, which became too expensive for locals to afford.
Domestic car sales boomed while some foreign food and beverage
makers were pushed out of the market altogether. Advertising on
city billboards, television and radio changed from flashy foreign
images to familiar designs and scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Russian-made cosmetics are especially popular outside Moscow in
Russia's vast regions, where average salaries are much lower. Last
year, Russian-made shampoo in the regions held 39 percent of the
market, up from 17 percent in 1998, according to AC Nielsen, an
international market-research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Local face-care products _ one of Green Mama's biggest sellers _
rose to 83 percent of the market outside Moscow last year, from 68
percent the previous year, according to the researcher. Locals'
market share was lower in Moscow, where imports still dominate.
</P>
<P>
   Nasobin's treasure is face cream, body lotion and shampoo. The
plastic tubes and bottles are dotted with sketches of flowers,
plants and berries and are named Taiga Formula after the vast
forests of central and northern Siberia. Extract of sea buckthorn,
a bright yellow Siberian berry, colors a new face cream. Ribwort, a
Russian roadside weed, makes face masques green. A new line of
larch-sap lipstick has just been released.
</P>
<P>
   The familiar ingredients are appreciated by Russian buyers, who
over the past decade have had their fill of foreign-made products
that they say are packaged alluringly but do not measure up to
Russian items.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the ruble's collapse drove up prices on imports,
buyers had already begun to turn away from many foreign-made
products, seeking the comfort of familiar brands of ice cream, soap
and hand lotion. Green Mama, though made mostly in foreign
factories, plays on that nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the way it smells,'' said Valentina Surkova, a
43-year-old accountant who grew up in eastern Siberia and now lives
in Moscow. ``Sea buckthorn berries _ this is my childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Competition is intense, as local producers scramble to find a
niche in the market space that has been created by the currency
devaluation's impact on imports. Green Mama ranks third and fourth
among local sellers of face-care and body-care products, its
biggest selling items, according to AC Nielsen.
</P>
<P>
   However, sales are far below those of its biggest domestic
competitor, Kalina, a company based in the Ural mountains. Large
foreign companies _ such as Germany's Beiersdorf, maker of Nivea
cream; Procter and Gamble; and L'Oreal _ occupy about half the
market, according to the Russian Perfume and Cosmetics Association.
The association, a group of about 60 local producers, was formed
five years ago to monitor trends in Russia's cosmetics industry.
</P>

   Russian women like to preen. Beauty-care product sales this year
will exceed $3.5 billion, according to the Perfume and Cosmetics
Association. That's up from $3.2 billion last year, and it includes
sales of major foreign producers.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of fitting the image of a factory worker dressed
in a shapeless smock and head scarf, women these days meticulously
accentuate their femininity. A traveler to Moscow today would be
hard pressed to spot unlacquered fingernails or unadorned lips in a
crowd of women.
</P>
<P>
   Nasobin said he did not believe in marketing. He avoids
expensive national advertisements and gets the word out mainly
through local newspapers, radio and television. But the lack of
aggressive advertising also has helped limit Green Mama's share of
the market. Its annual sales total about $20 million, compared with
the $90 million in sales by Kalina, which also sells household
cleaning supplies produced at its factory in the Siberian city of
Omsk.

</P>
<P>
   The son of a schoolteacher, Nasobin grew up in Yekaterinburg,
the town in the Ural Mountains where former President Boris Yeltsin
rose to fame. In the late 1980s he made his first forays into
capitalism in the eastern port city of Vladivostok, where he bought
Chinese ginseng from local traders. His wife and two small children
live in France, but his parents and extended family have stayed in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian-foreign duality that has helped shape Nasobin's
personal story is also reflected in his attitude about the future
of his business.
</P>
<P>
   Though foreign countries helped Nasobin prosper, they also have
crimped his company's development, he said in an interview in his
central Moscow office, which is wedged between a cigarette factory
and a Soviet-era clock maker.
</P>
<P>
   Green Mama, named for a drawing Nasobin's son made of his wife
dressed to go out in green jewelry, has received unfair treatment
simply because it is Russian, Nasobin said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, foreign banks closed his company's accounts without
explanation after U.S. authorities began investigating charges of
Russian money-laundering through the Bank of New York, though the
company was not linked to the inquiry. As the investigation
gathered momentum, banks tightened security for Russian companies
and citizens, hampering plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We brought our business to its feet abroad _ if we had been
based inside Russia this whole time, we would never have been able
to do the same thing,'' he said. Still, he said, ``there's a bad
image of Russians abroad,'' adding, ``I often have to explain that
I also eat with a fork and knife.''
</P>
<P>
   He has not been able to persuade a foreign bank to give him a
loan. He skims a small amount from profit each year to help the
business grow. That makes expansion slow, though he said he would
prefer a bank loan to a partner.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, Nasobin said, he plans to expand his Russian
operations, which now pump out only the simplest of products,
shampoo. The French factory is set to buy new equipment with some
of last year's savings, and the Russian factory will inherit its
used machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing the Russian production will also help cut costs.
Russian workers are paid about $300 a month, while company
employees in France make an average of $3,500.
</P>
<P>
   Still, business in Russia has its problems. Heavy taxes weigh on
profits, and property rights are not always protected. Nasobin is
embroiled in a struggle with local authorities in a small town near
Ryazan in central Russia over a ceramics factory he has leased. He
has structured Green Mama's Russian operations as a series of small
companies, registered separately, in order to help insulate the
business from threats of seizure in any possible property disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is finding supplies easy. Green Mama has an in-house
furniture maker and a clothing producer, and a packaging plant to
ensure supplies.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Green Mama will remain Russian with a French address,
just like Nasobin's children. But that will change, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I migrated, I didn't emigrate,'' he said. ``We need to decide
where Russia should go from here.''

BURST TIRE EYED AS POSSIBLE CAUSE OF CONCORDE CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ France's Transport Minister said Friday that evidence so
far pointed to a burst tire as the root cause of the fire that
engulfed the left side of the Air France Concorde that crashed
shortly after takeoff on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The minister, Jean-Claude Gayssot, issued a statement late
Friday that said he had just been appraised of the latest findings
by investigators looking into why the supersonic jet lost power and
slammed into a small, wooden hotel on the outskirts of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the information available at present to this body,''
Gayssot said, ``it emerges that at least one tire burst, something
that could have triggered a chain of events, damage to the plane's
structure, a fire and engine failure.''
</P>
<P>
   The minister's statement came shortly after investigators from
the French crash investigation agency confirmed Friday that at
least one of the tires on the left side of the plane had burst when
it was still on the runway. On Thursday, French investigators said
in a statement that pieces of tire had been found on the runway.
</P>
<P>
   But the investigators also seemed to downplay any notion that
the tire fragments had been sucked into the engines and had caused
the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators said that all the runway debris identified so
far came from parts of the aircraft other than the engines,
suggesting that the fire had begun elsewhere. They said they could
not yet be certain where the fire originated.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, French investigators said in a statement that the
plane had trouble with both of its engines on the left side of the
aircraft. Crew members reported to the control tower that one
engine had failed and that they could not raise the landing gear
upon takeoff. But flight recorders indicate that the a second
engine on the left side lost power briefly on takeoff. Less than a
minute later it lost power again. Then the plane, failing to gain
speed or altitude, banked sharply left and crashed.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, burst tires and wheel fragments have caused a wide
range of damage to Concordes. During one 1979 incident at Dulles
International Airport, tire debris and wheel shrapnel damaged an
engine, punctured three fuel tanks and severed several hydraulic
lines and electrical wires. A large hole was also torn in the top
wing skin.
</P>
<P>
   But in that case, the plane, leaking fuel, was able to return to
the airport and land safely.
</P>
<P>
   Experts, however, say the 1979 flight could easily have ended in
disaster. ``There is some luck involved in such things, '' said
Patrick Augin, a pilot and the vice president of France's largest
pilots' union, the SNPL. ``It did not cause a fire in 1979, but it
could have. Exactly where the holes occur can make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing the 1979 incident, the National Transportation Safety
Board said the Concorde's problems with burst tires were
``potentially catastrophic.'' The sleek needle-nosed Concordes are
particularly hard on landing gear. Their ``V'' shape wings produce
less lift, so the plane must fly faster on takeoff and landing
compared with other aircraft. High-speed takeoffs and landings heat
up tires.
</P>
<P>
   The safety board referred specifically to the possibility of
tire schrapnel touching off a fire or explosion.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the board praised Air France for maintaining
maximum mechanical safety and for quickly taking the measures it
recommended. It wanted pilots to keep their landing gear extended
after a blowout, partly to ensure that the damaged gear did not get
stuck once it had been retracted. But the board was also concerned
that a wheel rim or other damaged part, hot from friction with the
runway, not come near leaking, flammable fluids close to where the
wheels are stowed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, to changing the crew procedures, the airline
installed a ``flat tire detection system'' that was to inform the
crew if a blowout had occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The latest information from the French ministry appears to rule
out early speculation that the accident was related to last-minute
repair work on the reverse thrusters of the plane's No. 2 engine.
The day after the plane crash, the prosecutor conducting France's
judicial inquiry into whether there is any negligence involved in
the crash, had suggested that the fire began in the No. 2 engine.
At the time, members of the technical inquiry had said such a
conclusion was premature.
</P>
<P>
   As investigators continued to examine the debris Friday,
officials also reported that the toll from the accident was higher
than previously understood. At the crash site in the working class
suburb of Gonesse, firefighters discovered another victim, bringing
the number of dead to 114 people, 100 passengers, nine crew members
and five people on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The additional victim had been in the hotel at the time of the
crash and has not been identified, the officials said. Most of the
plane's passengers were German tourists flying to New York to board
a cruise ship. The lone American on the flight was identified
Friday as Christopher Behrens, a retired sales and promotion
executive for Air France, according to the Associated Press. He
lived alone in Germany and had no children.
</P>
<P>
   Still in shock over the crash, hundreds of Gonesse residents
gathered for their own memorial ceremony, a silent march from the
town's City Hall to the singed field where Air France flight 4590
crashed, destroying the Hotelissimo.
</P>
<P>
   Led by the mayor and the manager of the hotel, many of the
mourners held a single rose and said they had come to pay their
respects to the victims. As they dropped them at the edge of the
crash site, the air was punctuated with the sound of planes passing
overhead. Gonesse is a suburb tucked between two of Paris' three
airports. Aircraft noise is routine here. But some of the marcher's
said they had suddenly become intensely aware of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the accident, we didn't pay attention to the planes
anymore,'' said Claude Meunier, 50, who came with his wife and son.
``But since the disaster, everyone raises his eyes every two
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Air France also held a ceremony for its own with hundreds of
employees gathering in the tree line courtyard at the company
headquarters to hear personal tributes to the plane's crew.

</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 91-9, a $288 billion military
spending bill. It would fund weapons systems, military health
programs and rapid deployment brigades. Supporters said it would
restore the readiness of United States armed forces. Opponents said
the legislation was bloated with wasteful provisions. A ``yes''
vote supports the spending bill.

 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a sedate cocktail party on a summer evening in
Kennebunkport, Maine, when the wild man of the Bush clan wobbled up
to an old friend of his parents, a prim, well-dressed matron who
had recently turned 50, her hair pulled tightly back from her
forehead in the most severe way.
</P>
<P>
   George W. had enjoyed a few too many drinks, and his family
members knew enough to watch him nervously.
</P>
<P>
   ``So,'' he asked her, by way of conversation, ``what's sex like
after 50, anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   It was a vintage Bush moment, the kind that made young George's
friends laugh and cringe at the same time. He could be hilarious
company, but also often outrageous and childish. Some acquaintances
were offended by what they saw as Bush's arrogance and immaturity,
by his penchant for drinking too much and thinking too little. Even
his wife, Laura, wanted him to grow up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush was acting like a little kid'' in those days, recalled
Mel Turner, a fellow Republican activist in West Texas in the 1970s
and '80s. ``He was an immature rich-kid brat.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is that harsh, and many of his friends welcomed the
``bombastic Bushkin,'' as they called him, as a breath of fresh
air. But the upshot was that as he approached his 40th birthday, an
age when Al Gore was already a U.S. senator running for president,
George W. Bush was just a heavy-drinking, fun-loving oilman
struggling to control his temper, salvage his business and hold on
to his marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Then Bush did grow up. A classic late-bloomer, Bush offers
reassurance to 40-year-olds everywhere: Just 14 years later, he is
a multimillionaire, a successful businessman who turned around the
Texas Rangers and prospered with them; the overwhelmingly popular
governor of Texas, the only one to be elected to a second
consecutive four-year term; the about-to-be-crowned Republican
nominee for president, running ahead in the polls; and, apparently
most important of all in his own priorities, the very happily
married husband of Laura.
</P>
<P>
   Bush redeemed himself and is today very much a product of that
redemption. On the campaign trail, it lends him an air of
authenticity, allowing him to come across as a decent man today
without the baggage of having always been a squeaky-clean
apple-polishing mama's boy.
</P>
<P>
   There is a popular image of Bush's younger days, fueled by
late-night television jokes, suggesting that he spent much of the
1970s stupefied in a drug-fueled haze. But Bush's elliptical
comments suggesting that he used drugs before 1974 may have led
people to think that he was wilder than he really was, and the
fuller portrait of him in the 1970s and early '80s indicates that
his behavior was more callow than criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his friends say that, by the standards of his time, he
was pretty strait-laced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why he said all this about drugs,'' said Diane
Paul, his girlfriend from 1970 until 1972. ``He never did anything
like that. He was the straightest guy I knew. The most we ever did
was go to a party and drink beer. He was much straighter than most
of my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's problem, it seems, was not so much that he was dissolute
as that he was irresolute. He continued plodding along, acting
young and irresponsible when he was well into middle age, until he
faced a personal crisis.
</P>
<P>
   One of the common critiques of Bush is that he has enjoyed a
charmed life, without ever having to struggle, and there is
something to the idea that he has been incredibly lucky and
privileged at many junctures. But the truth is also more complex,
and on his own terms, life in the 1970s and '80s was no walk
through a Monet painting.
</P>
<P>
   With oil prices plunging, Bush floundered to keep his business
going. He was deeply pained that he had lost money that friends had
invested with him. And most cutting of all, some friends say, Bush
worried that his wife was so sick of his boorish behavior that she
would consider leaving him and taking his twin daughters with her.
</P>
<P>
   These pressures, instead of breaking Bush, changed him.
</P>
<P>
   There is no neat one-sentence explanation for how he grew up. It
was a gradual process, stretching from his arrival at Harvard
Business School in 1973 until after his 40th birthday in 1986.
Indeed, his friends say that he is still settling down.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the keys to his turnaround seems to have been his
succession of failures in politics and business, which
acquaintances said humbled him and left him much more likable.
Another was pressure from Laura Bush.
</P>
<P>
   So Bush gave up alcohol and turned toward religion. He remade
himself, and then his tremendous people skills _ backed by his
family connections _ took over and propelled him forward in both
business and politics.
</P>
<P>
   COMPETITION AND AMBITION
</P>
<P>
   What makes George Bush tick?
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the father and former president, the answer
arguably is fairly straightforward: ambition and a fierce sense of
competition.
</P>
<P>
   The younger George Bush is more complicated, and for him, the
answer reflects one of the critical differences between him and his
father: George W. is fiercely competitive but for most of his life
he was not ferociously ambitious. That combination helps explain
both the stuttering first two-thirds of his life and the triumphant
latest third.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, competitive people are also ambitious. But Bush has
been an anomaly, for from childhood he was always enormously
competitive in certain areas _ playing baseball, winning friends,
making people laugh, holding great parties _ without being
particularly focused on the future.
</P>
<P>
   Friends say that if there is one overriding reason that Bush
gravitated toward politics it is not so much overweening ambition
as a series of personal encounters with successful politicians;
after rubbing shoulders with them, he concluded: I can do better
than these bozos!
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the careers of Bill Clinton or Al Gore, one gets the
sense of a man grimly running a marathon, resolutely pushing on
with thoughts of glory at the finish tape. Bush's career, in
contrast, brings to mind a cheerful hitchhiker who has the
incredible good fortune to be picked up by a series of limousines.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether I'll be your president,'' Bush said in an
interview, adding: ``But you know, I've got the sense of, if it's
meant to be, fine. And if it's not meant to be, you know, heck,
it's not something I planned my life to be anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only when Bush arrived at Harvard Business School in the
fall of 1973 that he began to buckle down and prepare more
rigorously for the future.
</P>
<P>
   He lived alone in a small apartment, jogging and bicycling
daily, studying diligently, chewing tobacco, dressing wretchedly,
and stewing with frustration at what he saw as the arrogant
elitists around him. The Watergate scandal had left Harvard
fiercely anti-Republican, at a time when his father, as chairman of
the Republican National Committee, was defending President Richard
Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation in 1975, Bush still did not know what he wanted
to do with his life. He spent the summer in China, where his father
had taken an assignment as chief U.S. envoy, and this was an
occasion when his unfamiliarity with foreign policy had practical
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had hoped to date Chinese women, but as any student of
international relations could have told him, Chairman Mao was still
ruling China, the Cultural Revolution was under way and China's
women were unwilling to give up their Little Red Books to engage in
counterrevolutionary entanglements with visiting Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Bush took up a family friend's invitation to return
to Midland, Texas, where he had spent his childhood. He decided to
start in the oil business just as his father had.
</P>
<P>
   ``It smelled right and it felt right,'' Bush recalled, adding:
``I really wanted to be my own man, my own businessman.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Bush worked hard to build up his oil business
and, in 1978, to run unsuccessfully for Congress. He married Laura
and stopped bringing his laundry over for his friends' wives to
wash for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He buckled down when he came to Midland,'' said Joe O'Neill, a
friend since childhood. ``That was the turnaround. He was serious
about making it in the oil business.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet while there is something to that, Bush also seems to have
retained a good bit of immaturity even as he forged ahead in the
business world. Young people often found him charming, fun and
exciting to be around, as well as tremendously friendly and
likable. But others sometimes saw him as arrogant and childish.
</P>
<P>
   ``My impression at that time was that he was a little
immature,'' recalled Curtis Webster, a local banker and city
councilman. Webster remembered a time when he and a friend met Bush
on the street, and Bush play-punched the friend on the arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like you do when you're 12,'' Webster said with distaste. ``I
thought he was real immature.''
</P>
<P>
   On another occasion, Bush barged in late at a Republican
reception at the Hilton Hotel in Midland. He greeted everybody with
a bit too much ebullience (``Hey, here I am, did anyone miss me?'')
and then came up behind a pompous dignitary who was in
midconversation and tapped him on the far shoulder, so that the man
turned to find nobody at all.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Bush's friends tittered, but others present saw it as
confirmation that Bush had a few rough edges.
</P>
<P>
   The election defeat in 1978 was a major blow to Bush and his
friends, but many people in the area thought that it was the best
thing for his personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard a lot of people say that the experience changed
him, made him more humble,'' said Johnnye Davis, a local Republican
activist who raves about Bush but also recalls a ``cocky side''
that turned some people off.
</P>
<P>
   That cockiness also seems to have retreated as Bush faced
difficulties in the business world and struggled through a business
downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has spoken about the usefulness of his business experience
in running for president, and in the interview he talked of having
done ``pretty well.'' But an accurate assessment of his time in the
oil business would be mixed: he proved fabulous at recruiting
investors, but not nearly so good at running a company profitably.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, Bush's strength lay in salesmanship. Then as now, he
was a brilliant fund-raiser, and through his family and father's
friends raised millions of dollars to drill for oil. But he never
found much petroleum, and then in the mid-1980s oil prices
virtually collapsed, so that his investors _ like many others _ did
poorly.
</P>
<P>
   According to a company prospectus, Bush raised $4.67 million
from his limited partners, but his company returned only $1.55
million in distributions (plus hefty tax write-offs). Meanwhile,
Bush structured the deals so that he did pretty well for himself
even as his investors suffered.
</P>
<P>
   After the first few years, when he took no salary at all, he
paid himself a salary of up to $82,000. He also kept 80 percent of
the company for himself, had the company take distributions of
$362,000 on $102,000 in investments, and finally sold his stake in
the company in 1986 for stock worth $530,000, according to
Securities and Exchange Commission filings.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a bad arrangement for himself, and Bush's longtime
friend and accountant, Robert A. McCleskey, says that Bush's net
worth rose from $50,000 in 1975 to more than $1 million by 1988.
That is not, McCleskey notes, the record of a man who is a failure
in business.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was humiliating: investors had lost money, and
everybody knew that Bush had essentially failed in creating a
viable company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a humbling experience to drill a dry well and call up all
your investors and tell them that you convinced them to put money
into something that was no good,'' said Ernie Angelo, a leading
Republican businessman in Midland. Like an election loss, he said,
it is the kind of experience that makes a young man less cocky.
</P>
<P>
   ``He became a much more likable person in a few years after he
got here,'' Angelo said of Bush. ``He had the reputation when he
came here of being cocky and arrogant, and he lived that down.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   MARRIAGE, RELIGION AND TEMPERANCE
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, a crucial factor in the taming of George W.
Bush was his marriage in 1977. As an old friend from Yale days,
Donald B. Ensenat, says, ``Laura changed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnnye Davis, the Republican campaigner, puts it this way:
``Laura's the sweetest person you can imagine, and some of that
rubbed off on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush comes across as quiet and meek, and because she
started off as a school librarian Bush used to tease that her idea
of a speech is saying, ``Shhhhhh.'' But friends say that she can be
a tough woman who deflates her husband when she feels it is
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laura can be plenty tough, and she can chew him out,''
chuckled McCleskey, the accountant. ``I saw them once, when he was
giving orders to all these people and rattling off commands, and
she just looked at him and said, `Bushie, you're not president
yet!'''
</P>
<P>
   When others laughed at his raucous style and impishness, it was
Laura who told him to pipe down. When others offered him another
beer, Laura told him to cool it.
</P>
<P>
   ``She holds his feet to the fire,'' said Mike Barker, a West
Texas journalist who has known Bush since before he was married.
``My impression is that privately she tells him exactly what she
thinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Mutual friends say that Laura Bush was attracted to her
husband's impishness and boisterousness but also, over time,
wearied by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laura gets a lot of credit'' for calming her husband, mused
Elsie Walker, Bush's cousin. ``She loves George's fun side, but
after a while she got tired of George's edges that came from the
drinking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a riot,'' Walker added. ``But afterward, when you're
older, that can wear thin. And she would never hold back whatever
she felt.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush increasingly began to lean on her husband to quit
drinking, friends say. Bush says that he does not know if he was
actually an alcoholic but acknowledges that he was drinking too
much, and others share that assessment. He was not a mean drunk,
but when lubricated he could be loud, obnoxious and hardly the kind
of father a mother wanted around her young daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has told several friends over the years that he was forced
to choose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laura said, `It's me or the bottle,''' one longtime friend
quoted Bush as saying. ``She said it to me maybe 50 times.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His marriage was falling apart, and he cared about his
girls,'' the friend added. ``That's what turned him around.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has contested the idea that the marriage was ever so
severely strained, and some friends say they saw no signs of strain
beyond typical marital spats. One confidante believes that Laura
may have never quite given an ultimatum but that he told friends
she had because he felt in his mind that he had to choose _ that
unless he gave up liquor he would lose his daughters, whom he
treasured above all else.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, even those who say that the marriage was seriously
troubled say that Bush always appeared to be faithful to his wife
and shunned opportunities for flings when they came along, as they
sometimes did. He could be indiscreet about his love life before
marriage, friends say, but always insisted that he had been true to
Laura.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the summer of 1985 Bush met with Billy Graham _ a
meeting engineered by his parents _ at the family compound in
Kennebunkport. They had lunch on the patio overlooking the ocean,
dinner by the fire, and long conversations as they strolled along
the shore. Bush was inspired to begin reading the Bible daily
(which he says he still does), and back in Midland he began
attending a Bible study class.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had grown up in a religious household, attending First
Presbyterian Church in Midland, but it was an austere, restrained
Yankee faith. After his daughters were born, he switched to his
wife's church, First United Methodist, but a close friend says that
in those days he went to church each Sunday more for the sake of
his daughters than because of any deep inner commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet after the meeting with Graham and his Bible study sessions,
Bush became increasingly serious about his religion. He is at home
discussing religious matters with evangelical leaders in a way that
his father never was. Bush is publicly guarded about his beliefs
(partly because of a much-cited incident in which he suggested that
non-Christians could not get to Heaven), but by all accounts, his
faith has developed into something that is an important part of his
inner life and that was a significant element in his own maturing
process.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1986, a year after he had begun studying the Bible
seriously, George and Laura Bush went with a half-dozen friends to
celebrate their collective 40th birthdays at the luxurious
Broadmoor resort in Colorado. There was one evening when they all
stayed up late, drinking a bit too merrily.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Bush woke up feeling befuddled _ and quietly
resolved that he would never touch alcohol again. Friends say he
told nobody, not even his wife, until weeks after their return to
Midland. He simply drank sodas instead of beers, and it was many
weeks later that he finally explained to his friends that he had
given up liquor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush worked harder and mellowed a bit, so that while he remained
mischievous he was less likely to offend people. He did better at
controlling his temper. He became a better father. He grew up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a late bloomer, let's face it,'' said O'Neill, his
childhood friend in Midland. ``Twenty-five years ago, who would
have thought that he'd run for president? It took Laura, some dry
holes and some talks with himself to get settled down.''
</P>
<P>
   A LAID-BACK FELLOW
</P>
<P>
   The old George still flashes through from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   While he has buckled down in recent years, Bush even now on the
campaign trail comes across as unusually relaxed or complacent,
depending on one's point of view. He often takes Sundays off, he
reserves time for jogging or working out, and in contrast to Gore,
he gives the impression that he still would rather spend an evening
joking with friends than reading a health care policy analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying this relaxed approach seems to be a personal
philosophy that things will work out in the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody said, `Well, what are you going to do after you're
governor?''' Bush mused. ``Or, `If you don't win president, what
are you going to do?' I mean, I just don't worry about those
things. I kind of figure life is going to work its way out
somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   For many politicians, success arises from a mix of self-doubt,
drive and extraordinary ambition. When Bill Clinton lost his first
political race in 1974, he was out the next morning, shaking hands
with voters and thanking them for supporting him, his eye already
on the next election.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could be more antithetical to the way George W. Bush has
lived his life. He is a cheery guy whose success has arisen not
from self-doubt but from self-confidence, and when setbacks have
arisen he has normally shrugged and moved on.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just not that complicated,'' says Walker, his cousin.
``The things that would send me into analysis, well, he feels
conflict, but he can move on. He doesn't let it stop him.''
</P>
<P>
   Deep disappointment washed over Bush, for example, one April
afternoon when he was a junior at Yale. He fervently wanted to
follow his father and grandfather into Skull and Bones, the most
exclusive of Yale's secret societies, but word trickled out on
``tap day'' that he would not be among those invited for
membership.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was understandably subdued as he ran into a fraternity
brother, Robert A.F. Reisner, near the Yale Co-op bookstore. Bush
explained that he was deeply disappointed by failing to keep up the
tradition. But he added that he ready to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was philosophical about it,'' Reisner said. ``This wasn't
something that was going to do him in. He was ready to live with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush need not have been so stoical. Luck stood by him, as it
usually has, and that night he was tapped into Skull and Bones
after all.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush is asked whether he has any regrets in his life,
anything he would do differently, he shrugs and is typically
uncontemplative.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I don't live my life that way,'' he said. ``I'm not
one of those people who say, `Gosh, if I'd have done it
differently, I'd have__'''
</P>
<P>
   His voice trailed off. Been a presidential candidate? he was
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' he said, with a glint in his eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not one of these people that kind of gets stuck in the
past,'' he added. ``I'm always moving forward. I think one of the
things you'll find about me is I'm a person who's fairly
spontaneous and I don't brood and I don't get stuck. So I don't
know. I can't think of anything I'd do differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has also held on to a bit of his bombastic style and
needling humor. When his father was president and invited Queen
Elizabeth to the White House for a state banquet in May 1991, his
mother introduced him to the queen _ and he promptly began telling
a yarn about how he had embroidered his new cowboy boots with the
phrase ``God Save the Queen.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bush explained tartly to Queen Elizabeth that she had
seated George well away from Her Majesty, ``for fear of him saying
something.'' Then George confessed to the queen that he was his
family's black sheep and added, to his mother's horror: ``Who's
yours?''
</P>
<P>
   Queen Elizabeth smiled and retorted, ``None of your business.''

   LOS ANGELES _ War is the continuation of politics by other
means. Clausewitz said that. Politics is the continuation of show
business by other means. I said that, but it might just as well
have been said by Julius Caesar or Napoleon or FDR or even my
former boss, Richard M. Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   You have to keep that in mind when you ponder why the GOP is
meeting in, of all places, gritty, urban, old-fashioned
Philadelphia, while the Democrats gather two weeks later in
glamorous Los Angeles, center of the universe of sybaritic
fantasy-making. (Actually, the downtown part of Los Angeles is far
grittier than downtown Philly, but just a few miles away are the
lavish palm-fringed boulevards of Beverly Hills, while just a few
miles from downtown Philadelphia is, well, not Beverly Hills, where
magic is made and dreams come true.)
</P>
<P>
   To understand why the conventions are the way they are, and why
the GOP chose Philly, we might think of the conventions as a movie.
The Democrats' movie is lush: Al Gore and Bill Clinton soar into
town on Air Force One and Two and sweep into the homes of Jeffrey
Katzenberg and Steven Spielberg in long processions of limousines,
and then the crown passes from Clinton to Gore in downtown's
Staples Center while klieg lights illuminate the liquid Southern
California sky. It's a pleasant image, and it's OK for a TV movie
of the week. But where is the drama? Where is the ``arc,'' as we
say? Gore goes from a mansion on Observatory Circle off
Massachusetts Avenue to mansions in Malibu? That's no arc.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP (I hope, I hope) has it figured out a lot better. In a
variant of ``Road Warrior'' or maybe ``Alien,'' a group of party
stalwarts from Boise and Salt Lake City and Jackson and Dallas and
Kennebunkport is dropped down in the middle of that same gritty
Philadelphia. The landscape is completely foreign.
</P>
<P>
   Little by little, savage road attackers _ ecoterrorists,
spiky-haired anarchists and anti-globalists in heavy makeup _
gobble up the delegates. But then out of nowhere, (Hey, this is
even better than ``Road Warrior''!) down sweeps Batman and Robin
(Dubya and Dick Cheney), in a giant SUV from George W.'s ranch!
Using their good character and armor against divisive political
tactics, they blow their attackers away.
</P>
<P>
   To make it better, we throw in a generous slice of ``Rocky,''
the ultimate movie of Philadelphia and redemption of the underdog.
After Dubya and Dick Cheney have frightened off the first group of
attackers, they think they are safe, and start to unwind with some
Tex-Mex food and beer. But when they leave the tavern, they're
quickly surrounded by Pat Buchanan and Ralph Nader and a howling
mob of environmental protectionist agitators.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Cheney have to battle against unheard-of odds to get
through the mobs (think of Richard Nixon besieged in Caracas in
1958 or maybe of those little children lost in the forest in Hansel
and Gretel) to make it back to the convention, which has been moved
to the front of the Philadelphia Art Museum.
</P>
<P>
   They break free of the pursuers, and then, to the soaring music
of Yale's anthem, ``The Whiffenproof Song,'' dance around and
shadow-box before they go inside to the exultation of the masses of
delegates. As an exhausted, groggy, but defiant Bush takes the
stage, he turns his head and bellows, ``Noooo inheritance tax ...''
and the GOP goes wild. (It even sounds a little like ``Yoooo,
Adrian ...'')
</P>
<P>
   I'm telling you, I was a bit mystified when the party chose
Philadelphia. But now that I understand, I'm down with it. The
dramatic arc takes us right through to Inauguration Day. And think
of the sequels.

   WASHINGTON _ If plagiarism is the sincerest form of flattery, I
am more than happy to be flattered that the theme of the Republican
National Convention's opening night on Monday is ``Leave No Child
Behind,'' the four words that constitute the Children's Defense
Fund's trademark.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to children, no one has a monopoly on good
intentions or inspirational language. When children's needs are
elevated to the top of the national agenda for action, it doesn't
matter what party benefits, as long as children do. So I applaud
the GOP's interesting choice of words _ but only if it reflects
party principles rather than political posturing, and leads to
significant action.
</P>
<P>
   Heaven knows, children need urgent action from leaders of both
political parties, now more than ever. While the nation enjoys the
greatest prosperity in history, tens of millions of children are
being left behind: 13.5 million live in poverty, 12 million have no
health insurance, 5 million are home alone every day after school
lets out. And more than 4,000 each year pay the ultimate price for
adult irresponsibility; they are killed by guns.
</P>
<P>
   Millions more receive substandard education in crumbling schools
without enough books, equipment or teachers. Or they are eligible
for Head Start or child care assistance when parents work but
receive neither. Or they are abused or neglected, or are
languishing in temporary foster homes, waiting for adoption.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas speaks often of the need to leave
no child behind as he discusses his state's laudable educational
progress. Yet a disproportionately high number of children are left
behind in his state. Texas was one of the last states to carry out
the Children's Health Insurance Program and has the highest
percentage of children without health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   It ranks 48th in child immunizations and 45th in early prenatal
care. It is fifth-highest in numbers of children living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   As president, what would George W. Bush do differently? Would he
take his cues from some fellow Republican governors, like John
Rowland of Connecticut or George Pataki of New York, who have shown
real leadership in helping children get a healthy start?
</P>
<P>
   It is not only morally wrong but economically foolish to allow
one in five American children to live in poverty. How would we feel
about a family that kept four of its five children well fed, well
clothed and well educated, but let the fifth go hungry and without
health care or good preparation for the future? The acid test for
parties or politicians claiming the mantle of ``Leave No Child
Behind'' is what they will actually do.
</P>
<P>
   What will candidates do to expand the earned-income tax credit
for poor working families and raise the minimum wage; to ensure
that health care is a birthright; and to provide programs like Head
Start and good child care so that every child is ready to learn in
school?
</P>
<P>
   What will they do to provide safe after-school and summer
programs as alternatives to the streets? What will they do to raise
educational standards and accountability? How will they protect
children from guns and from violence in entertainment and on the
Internet?
</P>
<P>
   A fair and compassionate nation should be able to work across
party and ideological lines on behalf of children. ``Leave No Child
Behind'' should be more than the theme for an evening at a
convention or even a trademark for an organization.
</P>

<P>
   Avici Systems Inc. was flying so high Friday that even a sinking
Nasdaq Composite index couldn't drag it down.
</P>
<P>
   In a dazzling trading debut on Wall Street, Avici Systems'
initial public offering of shares tripled in value Friday. After
selling to investors at an initial price of $31 a share, Avici
closed at $96.75 a share at the end of a day of trading in which
the stock flirted with $102 a share.
</P>
<P>
   The North Billerica, Mass. company's rise was extraordinary amid
a tumbling Nasdaq and a dramatic statement of just how hot the
fiber-optic networking business in which Avici competes has become,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq fell Friday by 4.7 percent, to 3663.00, in a third
down day for the volatile index of technology stocks. Nasdaq has
dropped 9 percent since midweek amid concerns about high-tech
company sales and profits and uncertainty about whether the economy
has slowed to a sustainable pace.
</P>
<P>
   Avici, a maker of 7-foot-tall boxes that route Internet traffic,
was a standout performer among the 10 initial public offerings that
hit Wall Street Friday, the biggest IPO day in the stock market
since last October.
</P>
<P>
   Another Internet IPO, Corvis Corp. of Columbia, Md., also had a
stellar rise, to $83.7187 a share. Corvis, which is involved in
sending signals across optic networks, rose as high as $98 a share
during the day, after being priced by underwriters at $36.
</P>
<P>
   Corvis's ability to raise so much money, $1.14 billion,
surprised analysts, who said it was a record amount for a start-up
company that has yet to show any revenue. At its peak, Corvis had a
market value of more than $30 billion, also a record for a
technology start-up, according to the company's banker, Credit
Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Avici, by comparison, raised $217 million in its 7 million-share
IPO after twice boosting the sale to meet robust demand.
</P>
<P>
   Avici had $2.2 million in sales in the second quarter. Avici and
Corvis are benefiting from a surge in demand for the equipment used
in fiber-optic networking systems, as Internet use is exploding and
is expected to surpass voice traffic soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything in the networking world, the optical networking world
especially these days, is just blistering hot,'' said Bob Whelan,
an investment banker for the Prudential Volpe Technology Group in
Boston. ``A lot of big companies want to acquire these things,
either before or after they go public, at huge valuations.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Avici's biggest single investor is Nortel Networks,
according to Avici financial documents provided with the stock
offering. Nortel owns about 6.45 million shares of Avici's
outstanding stock, and, based on Friday's closing price, Nortel's
holding was valued at $623.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   There are no guarantees for investors that their shares will
hold their value in a weakening Nasdaq. Yet, investors continue to
gamble on stocks that they believe will be the winners in the
future of Internet technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the networking world, people want to find the next Cisco
Systems, and they're hoping this (Avici) might be it,'' said
Katherine Kirk, managing director for Chase H&AMP;Q in Boston. Kirk
said Avici's stellar performance reflects investor demand for a
relatively small number of shares available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike software companies, which typically seek to find
incremental improvements over competitors' products, firms involved
in developing the technology that makes the Internet network run
tend to leapfrog to a new level of innovation that can leave
competitors far behind. This makes the race for the winning
equipment particularly fast-paced and at times brutal, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   Avici makes high-capacity, high-speed systems that route huge
volumes of traffic over the Internet. Although still losing money,
according to public financial documents, the company is touting its
technology as next-generation equipment that can move high volumes
of information through fiber optic networks. Avici's competitors
include Cisco, as well as Juniper Networks Inc.
</P>
<P>
   If Avici's shares stay at current high levels, executives and
venture capitalists involved in the start-up will make a lot of
money.
</P>
<P>
   Avici's 41-year-old chief executive, Surya Panditi, who had
formerly been employed by US Robotics and Telco Systems Inc., owns
2.4 percent of the company's stock outstanding, or about 1.1
million shares, according to the filings. Panditi's shares were
worth $107 million Friday. An Avici cofounder, Henry Zannini, owns
690,000 shares.
</P>
<P>
   The company's sale of 7 million shares Friday brings to 46.037
million the total number of Avici shares outstanding. The initial
39 million shares, held by a small group of investors, are locked
up for a period of 180 days before they can be traded publicly,
documents said.
</P>
<P>
   Three venture-capital firms also hold large stakes in Avici:
Accel Partners of Palo Alto, Calif., about 4.88 million shares;
Brentwood Venture Capital of Los Angeles, 3.82 million; and Oak
Investment Partners of Westport, Conn., 3.82 million.

VALDERRAMA, DIALLO TOP MLS'S MARKETING GOALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Carlos Valderrama and Mamadou Diallo might be
the most pure marriage of midfield and striker in the five-year
history of Major League Soccer. Valderrama is the provider, the
cleverest passer in the league, and Diallo the speedy, strong
finisher who has scored 18 goals for Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   And, as MLS spends its All-Star weekend courting sponsors, it is
becoming obvious that Valderrama and Diallo are the league's best
advertising duo, a nightmare for defenders but a dream combination
for marketers.
</P>
<P>
   Valderrama was 33 when he was signed to a 10-year personal
services contract by the league in 1996, one of its first long-term
investments. He remains effective at 38, distinguished by his
frizzed-out orange hair and staccato one- and two-touch passing,
content with a peaceful existence in Florida, far from the chaos of
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo, 28, was a bargain for a league based on bargain-basement
dealing. MLS paid $250,000 to Diallo's Norwegian club and gained
one of its most prolific scorers and most visible stars. Diallo, 6
foot 3, wearing white shoes and close-cropped hair dyed orange to
match his partner, is also living the American Dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think of playing professional soccer, you think of
Europe,'' Diallo said Friday. ``I thought of America as more of a
basketball country, so I never thought of coming here. But when I
found out about playing soccer in America it became a dream. At the
beginning it was very hard, but once I got into the starting lineup
I thought I could be the top scorer and the top player in the
league. I have many great players to give me passes to score and I
have Carlos for motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   As in any successful marriage, there is conflict, tension,
resolution. During a Mutiny game last month, Diallo and Valderrama
were filmed shoving index fingers into each other's chests.
Apparently, they came to an understanding, through a combination of
two universal languages _ soccer and French. Valderrama learned the
language in the early '90s while playing for Montpellier, and
Diallo spoke French in his native Dakar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carlos does not talk too much but I understand him very
well,'' Diallo said. ``He does not like it if he gives you a pass
and you miss the goal. And if you score one goal he wants you to
score two, and if you score two goals he wants you to score three.
He is always saying we are not finished, try to score again.''
</P>
<P>
   Valderrama's encores and sacre bleus have helped make Diallo
probably the league's most valuable player. Clubs such as Blackburn
Rovers (England) and Metz (France) have inquired but no ``official
approaches'' have been made, according to MLS vice president Ivan
Gazidis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone might offer $1 million for him, or they might want him
on loan,'' said Patrick McCabe, who represents Diallo for Bob Wolff
Associates of Boston. ``Mamadou is happy in Tampa and he would like
to stay, but if the offer is good enough he will have to look at it
closely.''
</P>
<P>
   Diallo is the most successful of several players McCabe has
proposed to the league. In fact, he offered Diallo to the
Revolution in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``We missed him by one day,'' Revolution coach Fernando Clavijo
said. ``At the time, we had Wolde Harris and Eduardo Hurtado, but I
had a feeling Hurtado might not work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Mutiny coach Tim Hankinson acted quickly after pursuing several
other African strikers. His first choice was Siyabonga Nomvete, a
22-year-old South African with Kaizer Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nomvete would have been the most explosive player in the MLS
as far as pace,'' Hankinson said. ``He's young and he would have
been a good investment.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kaizer Chiefs raised the price on Nomvete and are now
apparently hoping to inflate it further after the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``African players have, a lot of times, not been put in the
right situations in the league,'' Hankinson said. ``A good example
is Doctor Khumalo in Columbus. We wanted someone with breakaway
speed, because Carlos is great at splitting the defense and leading
the forward to goal. We thought that Mamadou would provide
breakaway speed. And, even while he was getting adjusted he would
be effective because he is such a presence athletically that he
takes two defenders with him wherever he goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a risk. But it's like the stock market _ the greatest
risk can provide the greatest reward.''
</P>
<P>
   Places like Senegal, and even Colombia, are soccer's potentially
volatile equivalent of the NASDAQ. And Diallo's success is tempting
others to take the plunge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am organizing a trip to Senegal for coaches in January,''
McCabe said. ``I believe there is enough interest now and it would
definitely be worthwhile.''

 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a sedate cocktail party on a summer evening in
Kennebunkport, Maine, when the wild man of the Bush clan wobbled up
to an old friend of his parents, a prim, well-dressed matron who
had recently turned 50, her hair pulled tightly back from her
forehead in the most severe way.
</P>
<P>
   George W. had enjoyed a few too many drinks, and his family
members knew enough to watch him nervously.
</P>
<P>
   ``So,'' he asked her, by way of conversation, ``what's sex like
after 50, anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   It was a vintage Bush moment, the kind that made young George's
friends laugh and cringe at the same time. He could be hilarious
company, but also often outrageous and childish. Some acquaintances
were offended by what they saw as Bush's arrogance and immaturity,
by his penchant for drinking too much and thinking too little. Even
his wife, Laura, wanted him to grow up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush was acting like a little kid'' in those days, recalled
Mel Turner, a fellow Republican activist in West Texas in the 1970s
and '80s. ``He was an immature rich-kid brat.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is that harsh, and many of his friends welcomed the
``bombastic Bushkin,'' as they called him, as a breath of fresh
air. But the upshot was that as he approached his 40th birthday, an
age when Al Gore was already a U.S. senator running for president,
George W. Bush was just a heavy-drinking, fun-loving oilman
struggling to control his temper, salvage his business and hold on
to his marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Then Bush did grow up. A classic late-bloomer, Bush offers
reassurance to 40-year-olds everywhere: Just 14 years later, he is
a multimillionaire, a successful businessman who turned around the
Texas Rangers and prospered with them; the overwhelmingly popular
governor of Texas, the only one to be elected to a second
consecutive four-year term; the about-to-be-crowned Republican
nominee for president, running ahead in the polls; and, apparently
most important of all in his own priorities, the very happily
married husband of Laura.
</P>
<P>
   Bush redeemed himself and is today very much a product of that
redemption. On the campaign trail, it lends him an air of
authenticity, allowing him to come across as a decent man today
without the baggage of having always been a squeaky-clean
apple-polishing mama's boy.
</P>
<P>
   There is a popular image of Bush's younger days, fueled by
late-night television jokes, suggesting that he spent much of the
1970s stupefied in a drug-fueled haze. But
</P>
<P>
   Bush's problem, it seems, was not so much that he was dissolute
as that he was irresolute. He continued plodding along, acting
young and irresponsible when he was well into middle age, until he
faced a personal crisis.
</P>
<P>
   With oil prices plunging, Bush floundered to keep his business
going. He was deeply pained that he had lost money that friends had
invested with him. And most cutting of all, some friends say, Bush
worried that his wife was so sick of his boorish behavior that she
might even leave him and take his twin daughters with her.
</P>
<P>
   These pressures, instead of breaking Bush, changed him.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's maturation was a gradual process, stretching from his
arrival at Harvard Business School in 1973 until after his 40th
birthday in 1986. Friends say he is still settling down.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the keys to his turnaround seems to have been his
succession of failures in politics and business, which
acquaintances said humbled him and left him much more likable.
Another was pressure from Laura Bush.
</P>
<P>
   So Bush gave up alcohol and turned toward religion. He remade
himself, and then his tremendous people skills _ backed by his
family connections _ took over and propelled him forward in both
business and politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether I'll be your president,'' Bush said in an
interview, adding: ``But you know, I've got the sense of, if it's
meant to be, fine. And if it's not meant to be, you know, heck,
it's not something I planned my life to be anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only when Bush arrived at Harvard Business School in the
fall of 1973 that he began to buckle down and prepare more
rigorously for the future.
</P>
<P>
   He lived alone in a small apartment, jogging and bicycling
daily, studying diligently, chewing tobacco, dressing wretchedly,
and stewing with frustration at what he saw as the arrogant
elitists around him.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation in 1975, Bush still did not know what he wanted
to do with his life. Eventually he took up a family friend's
invitation to return to Midland, Texas, where he had spent his
childhood. He decided to start in the oil business just as his
father had.
</P>
<P>
   ``It smelled right and it felt right,'' Bush recalled, adding:
``I really wanted to be my own man, my own businessman.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush worked hard to build up his oil business and, in 1978, to
run unsuccessfully for Congress. He married Laura and stopped
bringing his laundry over for his friends' wives to wash for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He buckled down when he came to Midland,'' said Joe O'Neill, a
friend since childhood. ``That was the turnaround. He was serious
about making it in the oil business.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bush seems to have retained a good bit of immaturity even as
he forged ahead in the business world. Young people often found him
charming, fun and exciting to be around, as well as tremendously
friendly and likable. But others sometimes saw him as arrogant and
childish.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``My impression at that time was that he was a little
immature,'' recalled Curtis Webster, a local banker and city
councilman. Webster remembered a time when he and a friend met Bush
on the street, and Bush play-punched the friend on the arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like you do when you're 12,'' Webster said with distaste. ``I
thought he was real immature.''
</P>
<P>
   On another occasion, Bush barged in late at a Republican
reception at the Hilton Hotel in Midland. He greeted everybody with
a bit too much ebullience (``Hey, here I am, did anyone miss me?'')
and then came up behind a pompous dignitary who was in
midconversation and tapped him on the far shoulder, so that the man
turned to find nobody at all.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Bush's friends tittered, but others present saw it as
confirmation that Bush had a few rough edges.
</P>
<P>
   The election defeat in 1978 was a major blow to Bush and his
friends, but many people in the area thought that it was the best
thing for his personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard a lot of people say that the experience changed
him, made him more humble,'' said Johnnye Davis, a local Republican
activist who raves about Bush but also recalls a ``cocky side''
that turned some people off.
</P>
<P>
   That cockiness also seems to have retreated as Bush faced
difficulties in the business world and struggled through a business
downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has spoken about the usefulness of his business experience
in running for president, and in the interview he talked of having
done ``pretty well.'' But an accurate assessment of his time in the
oil business would be mixed: he proved fabulous at recruiting
investors, but not nearly so good at running a company profitably.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, Bush's strength lay in salesmanship. Then as now, he
was a brilliant fund-raiser, and through his family and father's
friends raised millions of dollars to drill for oil. But he never
found much petroleum, and then in the mid-1980s oil prices
virtually collapsed, so that his investors _ like many others _ did
poorly.
</P>
<P>
   It was humiliating: everybody knew that Bush had essentially
failed in creating a viable company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a humbling experience to drill a dry well and call up all
your investors and tell them that you convinced them to put money
into something that was no good,'' said Ernie Angelo, a leading
Republican businessman in Midland. Like an election loss, he said,
it is the kind of experience that makes a young man less cocky.
</P>
<P>
   ``He became a much more likable person in a few years after he
got here,'' Angelo said of Bush. ``He had the reputation when he
came here of being cocky and arrogant, and he lived that down.''
</P>
<P>
   A crucial factor in the taming of George W. Bush was his
marriage in 1977. As an old friend from Yale, Donald B. Ensenat,
says, ``Laura changed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush comes across as quiet and meek, and because she
started off as a school librarian Bush used to tease that her idea
of a speech is saying, ``Shhhhhh.'' But friends say she can be a
tough woman who deflates her husband when she feels it is
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   When others laughed at his raucous style and impishness, it was
Laura who told him to pipe down. When others offered him another
beer, Laura told him to cool it.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual friends say that Laura Bush was attracted to her
husband's impishness and boisterousness but also, over time,
wearied by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laura gets a lot of credit'' for calming her husband, mused
Elsie Walker, Bush's cousin. ``She loves George's fun side, but
after a while she got tired of George's edges that came from the
drinking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a riot,'' Walker added. ``But afterward, when you're
older, that can wear thin. And she would never hold back whatever
she felt.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush increasingly began to lean on her husband to quit
drinking, friends say. Bush says that he does not know if he was
actually an alcoholic but acknowledges that he was drinking too
much, and others share that assessment. He was not a mean drunk,
but when lubricated he could be loud, obnoxious and hardly the kind
of father a mother wanted around her young daughters.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1985 Bush met with Billy Graham _ a meeting
engineered by his parents _ at the family compound in
Kennebunkport. Bush was inspired to begin reading the Bible daily
(which he says he still does), and back in Midland he began
attending a Bible study class.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting with Graham and his Bible study sessions, Bush
became increasingly serious about his religion. He is at home
discussing religious matters with evangelical leaders in a way that
his father never was. By all accounts, his faith has developed into
something that is an important part of his inner life and that was
a significant element in his own maturing process.
</P>
<P>
   One morning in July 1986, Bush woke up feeling befuddled _ and
quietly resolved that he would never touch alcohol again. Friends
say he told nobody, not even his wife, until weeks later. He simply
drank sodas instead of beers, and it was many weeks later that he
finally explained to his friends that he had given up liquor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush worked harder and mellowed a bit, so that while he remained
mischievous he was less likely to offend people. He did better at
controlling his temper. He became a better father. He grew up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a late bloomer, let's face it,'' said O'Neill, his
childhood friend in Midland. ``Twenty-five years ago, who would
have thought that he'd run for president? It took Laura, some dry
holes and some talks with himself to get settled down.''
</P>
<P>
   For many politicians, success arises from a mix of self-doubt,
drive and extraordinary ambition. When Bill Clinton lost his first
political race in 1974, he was out the next morning, shaking hands
with voters and thanking them for supporting him, his eye already
on the next election.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could be more antithetical to the way George W. Bush has
lived his life. He is a cheery guy whose success has arisen not
from self-doubt but from self-confidence, and when setbacks have
arisen he has normally shrugged and moved on.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just not that complicated,'' says Walker, his cousin.
``The things that would send me into analysis, well, he feels
conflict, but he can move on. He doesn't let it stop him.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON -- This is a man who does not like to seem
over-eager. Particularly at the White House. Particularly now.
</P>
<P>
   When U.S. Senator John F. Kerry is running late for something,
which is often, he usually leaves the nervous jiggling of feet and
shortness of breath to others. Kerry, 56, prides himself on a
preternatural calm.
</P>
<P>
   But on a recent warm Wednesday, the Democratic Senator was late
for something big. He was due to appear at the White House, with
President Bill Clinton, Arizona Senator John S. McCain, and
Vietnamese officials, for the signing of an agreement normalizing
trade relations with Vietnam. It was something he had helped to
make happen, but getting to the ceremony on time seemed unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   After a hair-raising ride through the Capitol in his silver 1985
Dodge convertible, Kerry pried his lanky frame from the car,
adjusted his suit, and walked almost languidly to the White House
entrance. His traveling companions were more harried.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry does not like people to run when they are with him.
Hearing the fast clack-clack of an aide's heels behind him just as
he was approaching the door, Kerry stopped, reeled around and
issued a forceful directive:
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody needs to relax.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a man who may well be on Al Gore's short-list for vice
president. This is a man who does not want, especially now, to seem
over-eager.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, for much of his long political career, over-eager is
exactly what Kerry has seemed. At 26, he ran for office the first
time, setting his sights directly on the U.S. Congress. When he ran
for the Senate in 1984, he earned the nickname ``Liveshot'' for his
pursuit of free media. As a senator, he has been criticized for
concentrating on glamorous foreign policy issues at the expense of
mundane constituent concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mythology,'' he calls it, and ``early baggage from my years
when I was brash.'' Ancient history in any case, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and colleagues heartily concur, arguing that Kerry has
come into his own in recent years. They say he seems more at peace
with himself and his place in the world, and less concerned with
appearances than he once was.
</P>
<P>
   But right now, Kerry is extremely concerned with appearances,
and with good cause.
</P>
<P>
   The speculation on his chances of becoming Vice President Al
Gore's running mate, and premature congratulations, follow him
wherever he goes. Never has the senator been so closely watched,
and for so long, by so many people. His shortlist status is
mentioned in scores of publications across the country daily, each
miniscule development freighted with moment: a rumored Gore request
for the senator's tax records, a fundraiser with the Vice President
at Kerry's Georgetown manse, a flurry of votes and proposals by the
senator which seem to dovetail with Gore's priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry, used to having his every move raked over for evidence of
opportunism, is keeping mum, more or less. As a central figure in
this particular political parlor game, he avoids public discussion
of his vice presidential prospects because he knows he can't talk
about it without seeming too eager, or arrogant, or ambitious _
sure routes to also-ran land.
</P>
<P>
   But what Kerry calls the ``mythology'' is bobbing up like a cork
in some publications. This week, The New Republic called Kerry
``the most shamelessly self-promoting veep in the Democratic
party.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry's aides, and at least one Gore staffer, scoff at that: not
Kerry's style, they say. Besides, they add, the senator is more
astute than that.
</P>
<P>
   But Kerry will tell you there has always been a gulf between who
he is and how he's seen.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He may be on the brink of achieving his penultimate political
goal, but John Kerry says he feels like he could leave it all, that
he wants to be remembered for other things. He is not merely
playing down his vice-presidential ambitions. He is playing down
ambition, period. He says his political career, far from consuming
him, is only a small part of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's turning 50, maybe the journey traveled, but seeing
life go by you learn, you hopefully learn, to feel more
comfortable,'' he said recently, during a pause between Senate
votes. ``I feel as if I know how to balance the personal and the
professional. You feel like you know where things fit.''
</P>
<P>
   And his public career, from his anti-war activism to his
too-early run at the Congressional seat, to his stint as lieutenant
governor and service in the Senate, is but a part of who he is, he
says.
</P>
<P>
   He is proud of his hard-fought race for the Senate in 1984, and
proud of his victory over Governor Bill Weld for that same seat in
1996. He ticks off achievements like his role as chair of the
Commission on POW-MIA affairs, his investigation of money
laundering at the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, the
Marine Mammal Protection act, the Sustainable Fisheries Act, and
legislation to help put an extra 100,000 police officers on the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   But, he says wistfully, he wants other things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have greater certitude now about the things I'm fighting
for, and of how to get things done,'' Kerry said. ``But I don't
envision trying to die here. I'll run for re-election, but beyond
that, I have no sense. I love what I'm doing, but I want to be
defined by more than this. And there's definitely more to life.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what else he might want to do, Kerry throws back an answer
from way out in the bleachers: Something completely different, he
says. Maybe some kind of artist.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other signs that the something else Kerry is
aiming at has nothing to do with art. His recent flirtation with a
run for the Democratic presidential nomination, for example. And
his rumored interest in becoming governor of Massachusetts. And
what Massachusetts officials and even some staffers say is his
uneven enthusiasm after 16 years as a senator. Some local officials
say his heart isn't in domestic affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry has heard all of that, says the charges of careerism and
constituent neglect have weakened since his victory over Weld in
1996, and chalks much of it up to the peculiarities of his home
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Massachusetts is demanding and tough,'' he said. ``It has a
very low bullshit threshold and a high performance threshold. Other
places in the country wouldn't dream of the kinds of columns and
writings that we have in our state. It's more easy to take somebody
for granted and to have a more parochial view of them than people
who see you in a different role more often, maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   The prophet-without-honor-in-his-home-state argument might raise
some eyebrows among those who believe Kerry still has an imperfect
command of the local political landscape. But the voters seem to
know their man. To wit: Kerry's victory over the hugely popular
Weld, in a race closely watched across the country. He may not have
been a favorite of some political consultants and columnists over
the years, but Kerry has done just fine with Democratic voters.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a gap between the image and the man, it may be
because the man makes it hard to get past the image.
</P>
<P>
   ``His interpersonal skills are not as good as his public
skills,'' said Thomas Vallely, Kerry's longtime friend and fellow
veteran. ``He's a much better debater than he is at, `Let's try to
have a small conversation with someone you don't know very well.'
He's never going to be really good at that. It may take you a
little time to get through. He's not perfect. I'm not afraid to
tell him, `John, you know, don't be so self-centered.' But he's not
above self-improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   He set himself apart during the anti-war protests in 1970, too.
Others wore their hair long and camped out at the Capitol. Kerry
wore a perfect crease in his fatigues. And where others tossed away
their medals in protest, Kerry tossed only his ribbons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were wild times and he was not wild, he was careful,''
said Christopher Gregory, a fellow veteran who worked on several of
Kerry's subsequent political campaigns, and is now a Massachusetts
lobbyist. ``I guess actually, it took a while to warm to him. He
didn't seem to want that, really. He was concerned with the work,
not with people's feelings about each other. He was a good
leader.''

 WASHINGTON: ... good leader.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   That may be partly because of his upbringing, Gregory said.
Kerry, the son of a foreign service officer, was raised Catholic
and still attends services at the Paulist Center on Beacon Hill,
back in Boston. His was a cultured and proper New England family.
Kerry spent part of his childhood in Europe, and because of that,
and his Catholicism, he sometimes felt isolated from his
schoolmates.
</P>
<P>
   He says he fit in better at Yale, where he was an inconsistent
and easily bored student: ``I started out decently, but I became
very impatient,'' he recalled. ``In senior year, I practically
majored in flying. I now regret it, to be honest.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry threw himself into extracurricular activities: he was on
the debating team, headed the political union, and played all
manner of sports _ soccer, hockey, lacrosse, and others. David
Thorne _ who was a fellow Skull and Bonesman, also went to Vietnam,
and eventually became Kerry's brother-in-law _ had a similar
upbringing, and said getting close to him was easy.
</P>
<P>
   The two still do the kinds of things together now that they did
in college: windsurfing, snowskiing, sailing, rollerblading, golf.
The senator, his friends say, likes things that go fast -- cars,
boats, motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry has recently taken up the guitar. Aides say he sometimes
pulls it from its case in his red-walled Senate office and picks
out tunes from musicals like ``Cats.'' Mercifully, they say, the
Senator does not sing. Then there are the poems, which, Thorne
says, ``he carries around and doesn't show to anybody. It's
important to him and dear to him, and that's a side of him no one
sees. And I'm not sure he wants them to.''
</P>
<P>
   His friends say Kerry's marriage to Teresa Heinz has helped him
put his political career in perspective. Kerry says ``mythology''
too, surrounded him during the period between his 1988 divorce from
his first wife, Julia Thorne, and his 1995 marriage to Teresa
Heinz, giving him a playboy image which was fueled by his fluid
living arrangements for some of that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a period of time there was a mythology about me down in
Washington, about what I was doing as a single senator,'' Kerry
said. ``Whereas most single senators will tell you there's a lot of
loneliness that goes with that. And it's a special thing to be able
to fill that up with love and the fullness of a relationship such
as we've been able to have, much to some people's surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senator says Heinz has made him much better at carving out
time for a personal life, at the couple's Beacon Hill home, and at
her houses in Georgetown, Ketchum, Idaho, and Nantucket. When he is
not with Heinz, he says he tries to see one or both of his
daughters, Alexandra, 26, an actress, and Vanessa, 23, who is
entering medical school.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry is an affectionate and protective father, Thorne said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hopefully a learning and sensitive father who listens and
I try to pass on what I can,'' Kerry said. ``I try to give them the
scope to make their won mistakes and dare to do things.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that he is without paternal worries. Another day, when he is
joking with his interns and the subject turns to women, he says his
way of coping with the strain of having two girls is ``to tell
myself, `My daughters don't have sex.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``John's family was pretty reserved in the New England
tradition, and there were not a lot of public displays of affection
and emotion,'' Thorne said. ``John has learned to be more
affectionate, demonstrably affectionate. He's learned a lot from
his kids. He's grown a lot and changed a lot from (being) the
product of his family to the (father) of his own. His daughters
have demanded a more modern relationship of him.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now this son of a reserved New England family faces the prospect
of selling himself to more people than ever before, and knows it
would be unwise to make a bad first impression. Kerry and his aides
seem to have agreed that trying to make any impression at all at
this stage of the game is a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   It's not always easy, though.
</P>
<P>
   With persistent television hosts, or the reporters who
buttonhole him in Capitol hallways, he can avoid it altogether. A
few I'm-not-going-to-discuss-thats and
I-don't-think-that-would-be-appropriates, and he's off the hook.
But in the real world, he is a sitting duck.
</P>
<P>
   At Dulles International Airport recently, political consultant
Jimmy Rowan yelled ``I saw the article yesterday!'' from across a
crowded departure lounge. There had been a story in USA Today the
day before heralding Kerry's prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry gave a little wince, waved to Rowan, and kept talking on
his cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a lot more interested in him than he's letting on,''
Rowan said, drawing near to Kerry. ``They're serious about you!''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry, uncomfortable, shifted his tall, wiry frame in his seat.
The fine navy suit, the familiar mass of graying hair and the
unmistakable long jawline make him conspicuous enough to begin
with. Now everybody was looking at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (article) just mentioned me,'' Kerry tells Rowan quietly,
trying to turn proceedings down a couple of notches. ``There wasn't
much substance to it.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes, day after day. He's trying, but at times it
seems as if staying above the fray is a battle for Kerry. Tuesday,
when he held a Democratic National Committee fundraiser attended by
Gore at his Georgetown home, was a case in point.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of you have come up to me tonight and asked me if I
have any interest at all in serving as Vice President with Al
Gore,'' Kerry told 50 donors. ``Actually, none of you have asked me
that, and I'm a bit ticked off!''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry then launched into a speech attacking Bush and his
vice-presidential pick, Dick Cheney. It was just the kind of speech
a vice presidential nominee would give _ after his selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you John, that was a great speech, didn't y'all think
so?'' Gore said when he finally spoke. ``And I did take note of
that quip about the V.P. position.''

CLINTON WARNS PALESTINIANS ABOUT ABANDONING PEACE PROCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In an unusual and controversial interview aired on
national television here Friday night, President Clinton sternly
warned the Palestinians against declaring a state and suggested
support for the pro-Israeli position of moving the US Embassy from
Tel Aviv to the disputed city of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that there should not be a unilateral declaration. And
if there is, our entire relationship will be reviewed. I think it
would be a big mistake to ... walk away from the peace process,''
Clinton told Israel Television's Channel One.
</P>
<P>
   In a half-hour interview, Clinton vowed to strengthen strategic
and diplomatic ties with Israel following the failure of the 15-day
Camp David peace summit. He also praised Prime Minister Ehud Barak
for being ``more courageous and more creative'' than Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   The comments were greeted warmly by Israeli leaders and
commentators. But even they saw them as a calculated effort to help
Barak survive a pending no-confidence vote set for Monday in
Israel's parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Barak may need all the help he can get.
</P>
<P>
   His One Israel coalition government collapsed hours before he
left for Camp David when the conservative, religious flank deserted
him. It feared that Barak had failed to build a consensus on his
peace initiative, and said he was going too far in offering
concessions on Jerusalem and final borders in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's public statements on Jerusalem and on the Palestinian
desire to declare a state have angered Palestinian leaders. They
have expressed admiration for Clinton's tireless efforts at the
summit, but are accusing him of failing to be an even-handed broker
for peace.
</P>
<P>
   They openly wondered what impact the comments might have on
renewed Israeli-Palestinian talks, scheduled to resume Sunday. ``It
is very easy to blame the Palestinians and you don't pay a price,''
said Palestinian parliamentarian, Hanan Ashrawi, a spokeswoman for
Arafat at Camp David. ``There is no strategic aliance betwwen
Palestine and the US, but there is a strategic alliance between
Israel and the US.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that Clinton's shift to a pro-Israeli stance _ just as
the negotiations have reached perhaps their most fragile moment in
seven years _ reflected domestic political concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an election year in the US. I am being very cynical,
but it is true. These are the motivations,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's stated intention to declare a Palestinian state on
September 13, the deadline for a final agreement, has set a clock
ticking. Some fear violence if the two sides fail to reach an
accord that clearly spells out an end to the 52-year conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Ashrawi accused Clinton and the Western media of painting Arafat
as intransigent while failing to see the significant concessions he
has already made in backing down on claims to land taken by Israel
in 1948, including huge tracts of west Jerusalem neighborhoods that
were once Arab.
</P>
<P>
   Sovereignty over Jerusalem is the crucial issue in the
negotiations. Israel declares Jerusalem as its ``eternal and
indivisible'' capital. The Palestinians insist East Jerusalem,
captured by Israel in 1967, must be the Palestinian capital.
</P>
<P>
   The United States does not recognize Israel's annexation of Arab
East Jerusalem and has located its embassy in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   The US Congress passed a bill in 1995 aimed at moving the US
Embassy to Jerusalem, but Clinton has repeatedly made use of an
escape clause in the bill to postpone the move indefinitely on the
grounds of national security.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, however, he suggested a more flexible position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always wanted to move our embassy to West Jerusalem. We
have a designated site there,'' Clinton said, explaining that he
had not taken action before because he did not want to undermine
Washington's ability to be ``an honest broker'' in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in light of what has happened (at Camp David), I've taken
that decision under review and I'll make a decision some time
between now and the end of the year on that,'' said Clinton, whose
eight years in office will end in January.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's consideration of shifting the US embassy to west
Jerusalem has stirred trouble among the negotiators trying to solve
sovereignty of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Jones, a political scientist emeritus at the University
of Wisconsin and an expert on the Clinton presidency, criticized
the president's decision to grant the interview.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said it would almost certainly compromise the president's
role as a tireless and fair negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extraordinary way to deliver a message at a time of
very high drama. Thinking from a human aspect, he (Clinton) may
well just be very piqued,'' said Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``He laid his prestige on the line, and in his mind it was the
intransigence of Arafat (that stymied the talks). That is a
perfectly human reaction, but not the kind of reaction that
presidents, as diplomats, can afford to have.''

N.H. PRIMARY STATUS PRESERVED _ FOR NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary
dodged what could have been a fatal blow Friday when the rules
committee of the Republican convention killed a plan to let the
smallest states hold their presidential primaries first.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Delaware plan would not have provided an exemption
for New Hampshire to hold its primary before any other state, the
role it has traditionally played since 1952.
</P>
<P>
   Political operatives for Texas Governor George W. Bush spread
the word Friday that members of the rules committee should quash
the plan. But their reasoning had more to do with maintaining
harmony at the convention than with preserving New Hampshire's
status.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush signed a pledge promising to protect New
Hampshire's status, his campaign never mentioned the peril in which
the Delaware plan would place the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of New Hampshire going first hasn't come up,'' said
Charles R. Black, Jr., a Bush adviser monitoring the debate over
the nominating process.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas D. Rath, a member of the rules committee from New
Hampshire, said, ``No one has said to me that New Hampshire is the
problem. It's what happens after the frontloading.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush camp moved to stop the Delaware plan when delegates
from larger states, such as New York and California, threatened to
launch a floor flight when the convention convenes Monday because
they oppose letting the smaller states steal the limelight. Bush
officials have made it clear that they want the convention to
present a unified front face to the world, rather than angry,
arcane infighting that might turn off voters.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the Bush campaign also noted that if the
Republicans adopted a plan to avoid frontloading the primaries, the
Democrats would not, leading to worries that Democrats would get a
head start on the general election while Republicans are still
fighting over their nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could finish in March, be raising money and be ready to
pounce on us,'' said Black.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, Governor Jeanne Shaheen said the Republican
National Committee should do what the Democratic National Committee
has done, which is to carve an exemption into its nominating rules
for New Hampshire and for Iowa, which holds the nation's first
caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until that is done, New Hampshire is at risk,'' Shaheen said.
``George Bush said he would support keeping New Hampshire first. I
certainly hope he will weigh in about doing that at the
convention.''
</P>
<P>
   But Steve Duprey, chairman of the New Hampshire Republican
Party, said there is no sign that Bush plans to exact retribution
against the state. Bush lost the Feb. 2 primary to Arizona Senator
John McCain by 19 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really means it when he said, `Look, it was a wake-up call
and it made me a better candidate,' '' said Duprey, who visited
with Bush in Maine recently. ``There's no resentment at all.''

 c.2000 Newhouse News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Andrew Card was at the Republican National Convention in Houston
the night in 1992 when sharp-tongued conservative commentator Pat
Buchanan took the podium and warned that a ``religious war ... a
cultural war'' was being fought over the soul of America.
</P>
<P>
   The speech was a hit inside the convention hall, but Card feared
that it left viewers at home feeling uneasy, maybe even a bit
scared, about the Republican Party's message, as well as its
messengers.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years -- and two Democratic administrations -- later, Card
is the chief planner for the 2000 Republican convention, which
starts Monday in Philadelphia, and the message he hopes to project
this time is quite different.
</P>
<P>
   If everything goes according to Card's carefully scripted plan,
which is by no means a certainty with street protests expected and
roiling discontent inside the GOP over abortion, viewers will be
left feeling warm, fuzzy and, above all, welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``This convention is more about the word `together' than it is
about `divide,''' Card said in an interview. ``Just as Gov. Bush
has done, we're reaching out beyond those who call themselves
Republicans. This convention is about a new kind of Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   In order to entice independents and moderate Democrats into the
fold, planners hope to portray a Republican Party that people may
not recognize. The most visible sign of change will be at the
podium, which will feature a steady stream of African-American and
Hispanic speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent slots will be filled by longtime GOP stars like former
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell and Bush's
foreign policy adviser Condoleeza Rice. The minority roster also
features a Hispanic securities broker from Los Angeles who will
talk about economic opportunity and an African-American literacy
expert.
</P>
<P>
   Bush himself is expected in his acceptance speech Thursday to
acknowledge that his party has been less than a friendly haven for
minorities in the recent past. He has hit on the theme several
times while campaigning before African-American audiences and it
has been well-received.
</P>
<P>
   Just as convention planners are trying to change the face of the
party, so too are they sending notice that they care about more
than traditional Republican issues like tax cuts and a strong
national defense. In fact, those who tune in to the first day of
the convention may wonder whether a renegade Democrat has somehow
gotten hold of the schedule of events. That day will be dedicated
entirely to education and health care, the meat and potatoes of
Democratic politics for a generation.
</P>
<P>
   As the convention progresses, more traditional GOP themes will
take center stage. Days two and three of the convention will focus
on economic prosperity, national defense and tax relief, issues
that have always been near and dear to the hearts of Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the GOP convention is designed to be the
anti-convention, or at least appear that way on television.
Planners have scrapped the typical castle-turret design for the
speakers' platform and have replaced it with what will look to
viewers like a theater stage, which will morph daily into a
colorful backdrop designed to illustrate that day's chosen theme.
On day one, when speakers talk about education, they will stand in
front of a faux-classroom outfitted with desks, a blackboard and
students.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the speakers' lineup will feature ``everyday people''
rather than party poobahs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going after day-to-day people who have a story to
tell,'' said Pat Brister, the Louisiana delegation chair who is
also in charge of making sure everyone makes their on-stage cues.
</P>
<P>
   Those stories will be of the up-by-the-bootstraps variety
underscoring, in a subtle and non-threatening way, the Republicans'
message of self-reliance. Among the speakers will be a breast
cancer survivor, a blind mountain climber and a Chinese emigre who
came to the United States knowing no English and rose to become
head of the Peace Corps.
</P>
<P>
   Even the convention's theme -- ``Renewing America's Purpose.
Together'' -- is designed to sound more like a friendly invitation
than a rousing call to action.
</P>
<P>
   In still other ways, the tone of the proceedings is designed to
be reassuring and pleasant. Planners have axed from the program the
night usually dedicated to attacking the opposition. In
Philadelphia, sneering, sarcastic attacks on Democrats will be
frowned on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a totally positive, totally unifying
atmosphere,'' Brister said.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   The GOP will have less control over events outside the
convention hall. Across the street from the First Union Center, the
sports arena that will house the Republican gathering, protesters
are expected to do everything they can to get the attention of the
15,000 credentialed media representatives covering the convention.
Some of the protesters who carried the word of anti-globalization
to Seattle last year to disrupt the World Trade Organization
meeting are expected to show up in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a group working on behalf of death row inmate Mumia
Abu-Jamal is expected to be out in force to protest what they say
is a frame-up for the killing of a white Philadelphia police
officer in 1981. The protest will no doubt be fueled by a recent
suspect's beating at the hands of city police, which was caught on
videotape and broadcast worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Another wild card for convention planners is Sen. John McCain,
the upstart Arizona Republican who was Bush's closest rival for the
nomination. Although McCain has endorsed Bush, convention planners
are concerned that his speech on Tuesday could trigger a
spontaneous rally on the floor and draw attention away from the
presumptive nominee. Partly to address that fear, McCain has been
instructed to talk about national security rather his signature
issue, campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their best efforts to diffuse potential disputes in
advance of the convention, Republican leaders may have an internal
squabble on their hands. A group called the Republican Pro-Choice
Coalition says it will try to convince the party to drop the strict
pro-life plank from the platform.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Cullman, one of the coalition's leaders, said no
demonstrations are planned, but the group does intend to try to get
the microphone on the convention floor, a feat that will take the
support of at least six state delegations. She said she has been
frustrated up until now by what she sees as the GOP's intransigence
on this issue above all others.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been more civility toward us than in the past, but
when people are nice to you and say to you that you won't get your
way, you have to do what you have to do,'' Cullman said.
</P>
<P>
   One group that the GOP may not have to worry about,
surprisingly, is the conservative wing of the party whose
Buchanan-like stridency in the past has made reaching out to a
broader segment of supporters difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Schlafly of the conservative Eagle Forum, who rather
enjoyed Buchanan's controversial speech in 1992, proclaimed herself
in a recent interview to be satisfied with the format and content
of this year's convention.
</P>
<P>
   She said she hoped that planners allowed delegates to roam the
aisles and hold up signs, unlike at the 1996 convention in San
Diego. As for the direction of the party and the message convention
planners are trying to send in Philadelphia, Schlafly said she had
no concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, there is nothing to demonstrate about,'' she
said.

 CORPORATIONS OPEN WALLETS TO HELP THE PARTIES PARTY  
 ATTENTION EDITORS: This article from NEWHOUSE NEWS SERVICE for
FRIDAY, July 28, is available as a ``separate-buy.'' For

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ FirstEnergy Corp., an Akron firm that provides
electricity across northern Ohio, has dug into its corporate
pockets. So have American Electric Power of Columbus, Ohio, and
dozens of other companies collectively shelling out millions of
dollars this week to help pay for the Republican National
Convention and the social gatherings that will surround it.
</P>
<P>
   Why would Ohio utilities spring for a political event in
Philadelphia?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is as elementary as Politics 101: to stay in the good
graces of members of Congress who can make their corporate
existence more profitable or difficult. Some call it
influence-peddling, but the parties involved in the conventions say
they are merely playing by the rules -- if not the loopholes -- of
a political system driven by money. In fact, the Republican
convention, which starts Monday and ends Thursday, and the
Democratic convention Aug. 14-17 are providing scores of
opportunities for companies to pick up big tabs -- tax-deductible
-- for the political parties and their representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it were illegal, we wouldn't do it,'' said FirstEnergy
public relations manager Ralph DiNicola.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pretty routine stuff,'' said Pat Hemlepp, spokesman
for American Electric Power.
</P>
<P>
   It is so routine that the only thing exceptional this year is
price. The two conventions will cost at least $100 million,
according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington group
that tracks political spending. Of that, the federal government
gives $13.3 million to each of the two political parties, but
``Democrats and Republicans are depending on some generous
corporate donors for the rest,'' a recent report by the center
said.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Motorola, AT&AMP;T, General Motors, Verizon Communications and
Comcast Corp., each giving $1 million for the Republican
convention, and dozens more companies providing smaller amounts,
according to Republican National Committee reports analyzed by the
center.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic convention in Los Angeles also will see its share
of corporate largess, with $1 million commitments by BP Amoco,
Microsoft, United Parcel Service and several others, and $2 million
by the financial service and insurance company American
International Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The record of convention fund raising is on pace to shatter
all previous records,'' Scott Harshbarger, president of Common
Cause, wrote in a letter of complaint this month to the Republican
and Democratic convention committees. ``The largest majority of
this money is being contributed by special interests, many of which
have pressing issues before Congress or the Clinton
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Electric utilities, for instance, are pressing for deregulation,
which will allow companies like FirstEnergy to compete for
customers in new markets across the country. The House Commerce
Committee has been working on an electricity restructuring bill
that could ease the way, but its work recently stalled over whether
states or the federal government should have jurisdiction when
there are disputes over interstate transmission of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The matter might not be resolved until next year, when the
committee's leadership will change -- and Michael Oxley, R-Ohio,
could become chairman.
</P>
<P>
   So when Oxley Monday night hosts his private ``tribute'' to
fellow committee members at the American Bandstand Theater in
Philadelphia, with Dick Clark, Chubby Checker, Bobby Rydell and
Frankie Avalon paid to entertain, FirstEnergy and American Electric
Power will help foot the bill. So will companies that include
E-Trade, Price Waterhouse Coopers and utilities in Georgia, Texas
and Pennsylvania. They will divvy up the expected $300,000 to
$400,000 cost, said Pamela Sederholm, a public affairs specialist
planning the party.
</P>
<P>
   Oxley's is just one such party. Others include a ``Mardi Gras''
night hosted by Billy Tauzin of Louisiana, chairman of a House
subcommittee on telecommunications, and financed by
telecommunications companies, among others. Tauzin is competing
against Oxley to chair the House Commerce Committee next year.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles next month, John Dingell of Michigan, the ranking
Democrat on Commerce, will host Democratic guests at the House of
Blues. The nuclear, gas and mining industries are picking up the
tab, according to Common Cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously it's an important committee, (and) it's important
for us to maintain good relations with the committee,'' DiNicola
said of FirstEnergy's financial involvement in Oxley's party.
``Fair treatment by the government,'' he said, equates to better
prices and service for electricity customers.
</P>
<P>
   Oxley did not return calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the conventions are no different from social events on
Capitol Hill, where direct donations to campaigns and gifts to
members of Congress are limited by law but there other ways to
shower favor on a willing lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``People invite congressmen and senators to charitable functions
where they get their travel and food paid for,'' said Steve
Weissman, legislative representative of Public Citizen, a group
that promotes restricting the influence of money on politics. ``So
there are ways in which there is at least a modicum of favor, but
more a kind of favorable atmosphere created by these high-spending
special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   The conventions merely present a more concentrated opportunity
for corporate involvement: General Motors will provide cars, AT&AMP;T
will hand out cellular phones, and -- thanks to the ingenuity of
Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the House majority whip -- Union Pacific
will supply a rail car 600 feet from Philadelphia's First Union
Center so members of Congress can escape from the hubbub and relax.
(Golf carts are available if a member doesn't want to walk to the
rail car.)
</P>
<P>
   Separately, more than 80 members of Congress and their families
will stay at an old ship repair facility no longer used at the
Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, where defense contractors will be
showing off their wares. The accommodations, spruced up for the
occasion, will be on par with Holiday Inn, said a spokesman for
Rep. Curt Weldon of Pennsylvania, a House Armed Services
subcommittee chairman who arranged for the former military housing.

 COLIN POWELL IN SPOTLIGHT AT OPENING NIGHT OF GOP CONVENTION

 By ROBERT COHEN  
 c.2000 Newhouse News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Retired Gen. Colin Powell, who rejected a White
House bid many thought he could win and later ruled out the vice
presidency, will take center stage Monday night at the Republican
National Convention to spread George W. Bush's message of inclusion
and compassion.
</P>
<P>
   As the featured opening night speaker, the popular Powell will
talk of improving education, expanding health care and helping poor
youngsters as a way of highlighting Bush's campaign pledge to
``leave no child behind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This speech will be less on global politics and more on the
importance of taking care of, promoting, encouraging and mentoring
young people, who are in fact America's promise,'' said Kenneth
Duberstein, a close Powell friend and President Reagan's former
chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   But the presence of Powell, who could be named secretary of
state in a Bush administration, is also designed to send the
message that a Bush presidency, as the campaign likes to say, will
have ``a generous heart'' and maintain an ``open door'' for
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are competing for the minority vote and you want to
appear inclusive, it is good marketing and good politics to have a
nonwhite face up there, especially if it is someone as highly
revered by the American people as Gen. Powell,'' said Ward
Connerly, a black California Republican and a leader in the fight
against affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Walters, a professor of Afro-American studies at the
University of Maryland, said Powell is a centrist who believes in
smaller government but also has views at odds with the traditional
GOP agenda like support for affirmative action, abortion rights,
immigration and helping the downtrodden. Powell describes himself
as ``a fiscal conservative with a social conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Walters said Powell spoke on the first night of the GOP
convention in 1996 for nominee Bob Dole and, while receiving
standing ovations from the crowd, was out of step with the
conservative forces that dominated the San Diego gathering.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time around he is more in sync with what the nominee
wants to do -- to show a more moderate face to the American
voters,'' said Walters. ``Powell will appeal to blacks, at least
symbolically, but also will signal white independent and moderate
voters that Bush wants an inclusive administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Duberstein said Powell will definitely stress inclusion, as he
did in 1996 and as Bush has done on the campaign trail, and will
not shy away from expressing his views in support of affirmative
action and immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Other prominent African-Americans will be featured speakers
during the convention, including Bush's foreign policy adviser
Condoleeza Rice and Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma. Several
Hispanic-Americans, including Rep. Henry Bonilla of Texas, will be
given prominent speaking slots.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's wife, Laura, will share the opening night stage with
Powell.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, 62, served as President Reagan's national security
adviser and as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under
President Bush. He was the first African-American to hold either
post, and as head of the Joint Chiefs, he oversaw the Persian Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Harlem to a family of Jamaican heritage and raised in
the poverty-ridden South Bronx, Powell retired from the military in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote a best-selling book, ``My American Journey,'' in 1995,
joined the Republican Party, and rejected a run for the White House
in 1996 and the No. 2 spot on the ticket with Dole despite his
enormous public appeal.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Powell again ruled out seeking the GOP
presidential nomination and let Bush know that he did not want to
be considered for the vice presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats feared the choice of Powell as vice president
would have given Bush a tremendous boost. It is now widely expected
that Powell will be in line to become secretary of state if the
Texas governor wins in November.
</P>
<P>
   For the past three years, Powell has headed an organization
called ``America's Promise: The Alliance for Youth.'' This
organization is geared toward mobilizing communities and
businesses, civic, religious and nonprofit groups to assist young
people -- a theme that connects with one message of the Bush
campaign and with the first night of the GOP convention.

INJURED HOCKEY PLAYER TAKES FIRST STEPS IN 4 1/2 YEARS

<P>
   BOSTON _ Slowly, but surely, John Gilpatrick placed one foot in
front of the other Friday and walked across the first-floor
function room. Confident he could successfully make the 30-foot
journey on his own, the former Suffolk University hockey player sat
down next to his mother and smiled.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty small steps for most, but a momentous and poignant giant
leap for the 27-year-old from Hanover.
</P>
<P>
   It has been 4 1/2 years since Gilpatrick was hit from behind
during a game, sending him head first into a goalpost causing a
devastating spinal cord injury that left him in a wheelcair, with
no use of his legs and right arm.
</P>
<P>
   But during a packed news conference at Suffolk University Law
School, Gilpatrick fought back tears as he talked of his
determination not to spend the rest of his days labeled as a person
with special needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot exactly explain it. One morning I woke up and told
myself I was going to walk,'' Gilpatrick said. ``The first six
months were hard, but I always got up in the morning. I never gave
up. With my step-father's help, I took my first steps, again.''
</P>
<P>
   Crediting a huge outpouring of good will, unwavering
perserverence and intense physical therapy, Gilpatrick recalled how
about a month ago he began to experience some pain, or what he
called a burning sensation, in his spine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes this burning is connected with positive return,''
Gilpatrick said. ``As you can see this return has allowed me to
stand unaided, and to walk.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilpatrick wanted to keep his good news a secret for a few more
weeks, but word of his success got out after he was seen walking
around town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it. My mouth dropped to the floor,'' said
Michael Murphy, 26, a lifelong friend who saw Gilpatrick walk
Monday. ``He just walked through my front door and said, `Hi.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gilpatrick's recovery also astonished Dr. David Apple, a
specialist in spinal cord injuries who treated Gilpatrick at the
Shepherd Center in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that a patient's best chances for recovery comes within
the first two years from when an injury is sustained.
</P>
<P>
   Gilpatrick's ability to take his first steps, Apple believes,
comes from a combination of hard work and sheer luck that his
spinal injury was not as bad as it could have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't do anything special, he did all the hard work,''
Apple said. ``The young man has a lot of determination.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilpatrick undergoes many hours of physical therapy every week
with the goal of improving his ability to walk.
</P>
<P>
   Gilpatrick became a quadriplegic on Jan. 25, 1996 after he
rushed to the net and was hit from behind, causing his head to
strike the goalpost and then whip backward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember watching it happen. He dropped right to the ice,''
recalled Suffolk head hockey coach Brian Horan, who was then the
team's assistant coach. ``I rushed out to him and he said, `Coach,
I can't feel anything.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gilpatrick's injury occurred on the same section of the ice at
the Walter Brown Arena where three months earlier Travis Roy was
paralyzed in his first game for Boston University when he lost his
balance and crashed head first into the boards.
</P>
<P>
   Gilpatrick said he kept in close touch with Roy, who was
paralyzed from the neck down, after meeting him while they were
both rehabilitating at the Shepherd Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walking is a little hard for me because I have so many friends
who remain paralyzed,'' Gilpatrick said. ``I keep telling them
never to give up. Doctors aren't always right.''
</P>
<P>
   For Gilpatrick, the 1996 accident, was the second major injury
Gilpatrick sufferend playing hockey. In 1989, as a sophomore at
Hanover High School, he broke his neck, leaving him paralyzed for
three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always worried about his safety, but there wasn't much
I could do,'' explained Elaine Jones, Gilpatrick's mother. ``My son
loves hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   But she also has come to admire another and ultimately, perhaps,
more important passion her son possesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been relentless in his pursuit to stand and walk,'' Jones
said. ``I'm very proud of John. I didn't think that he would walk.
He did.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilpatrick, who returned to school in September 1997 with the
help of Ice, his Rottweiler guide dog, was an assistant hockey
coach at the school. He received a bachelor's degree in criminal
justice last December and plans to attend Suffolk University Law
School next month.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to get back on the ice, Gilpatrick said he hopes to coach
hockey someday without the use of his wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm done with playing, but I would love to be on skates to
coach those guys,'' Gilpatrick said pointing to some team members
standing on the other side of the room.

 &HT;    Scientific-Atlanta beats analysts' expectations for quarter by 8
cents
 &HT;    By Caroline Hubbard

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Scientific Atlanta is on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   The Norcross company said Friday its first quarter would beat
analysts' estimates by more than 3 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   The company expects to earn 28 cents to 30 cents a share in the
first quarter, Chief Financial Officer Wallace Haislip said. That's
above the average estimate of 25 cents from analysts surveyed by
First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch upgraded the stock to a buy, temporarily boosting
the company's stock price. The stock closed at $77.06.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific-Atlanta started announcing good news late Thursday,
reporting record fourth-quarter earnings of $59.1 million, or 35
cents a share, which beat analysts' estimates by 8 cents a share.
Sales were $552.6 million, up 56 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For its fiscal year ended June 30, Scientific-Atlanta earned
$155.8 million, or 94 cents a share, on sales of $1.71 billion.
That's a 52 percent gain over $102.3 million, or 65 cents a share,
on sales of $1.24 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for Scientific-Atlanta's end-to-end cable products _ from
transmission equipment to television set-top boxes _ pushed orders
to $639.3 million in the fourth quarter, 64 percent higher than
last year, said Chief Executive Officer James McDonald on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The next quarter likely will beat analysts' expectations too,
the company said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific-Atlanta expects profit of $1.25 to $1.30 a share in
fiscal 2001, compared with current estimates of $1.13, Haislip
said. Profit will be boosted by increased sales of set-top boxes,
with about 1 million shipped each quarter, Haislip told Bloomberg
Television. There were 835,000 shipped in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific-Atlanta is the No. 2 U.S. set-top box manufacturer
behind General Instrument, a division of Motorola.

TEAMSTERS IN NEW YORK MORE LENIENT WITH MOVIE MAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KURKJIAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A few months ago, a handful of television producers
filed into the office of the Teamsters Union chief who handles film
production in New York to protest the decisions of one Teamster
supervisor they felt were unfair and costing them too much money.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Thomas R. O'Donnell, the Teamster chief, ruled in
favor of the supervisor, the producers came away heartened that he
had considered their complaint and called the supervisor on the
carpet to explain himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just would not happen in Boston,'' said one producer who
was familiar with the meeting and asked not to be identified. ``In
Boston, there is rarely any effort to compromise or reach common
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell, who has headed the New York Teamsters' local that
contracts with the filmmakers for 40 years, stressed in an
interview Friday that his union is flexible in considering the
demands on cost and working conditions that the producers and other
executives make on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a happy medium to be struck here, and except for
wages, I am willing to consider any request that a filmmaker has,''
O'Donnell said. ``We're not to be doing anyone any favors by making
it so that they don't want to come back here. It just makes sense
in the long run to be flexible.''
</P>
<P>
   In discussing their reluctance to shoot more movies in
Massachusetts, studio executives and independent producers
inevitably emphasize the refusal of the Teamsters union in Boston,
Local 25, to compromise on key provisions in their lucrative,
benefit-laden contract. It is a contract that guarantees all
Teamsters 25 hours of overtime every week, which means the lowest
paid driver makes a minimum of $2,002 a week for the standard
65-hour work week, while the two top supervisors bring in $2,853
and $2,475 respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Filmmakers in New York pay Teamsters about as much for a week of
work as they do in Boston, but in New York the crews work a
standard 70-hour week, five more hours. Several filmmakers
interviewed recently said additional benefits in the Boston
contract, that Teamster President George Cashsman and Louis
DiGiampaolo, who negotiates the film contracts with the studios,
consider inviolable discourage them from coming to Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Teamster officials in Boston could not be reached for comment
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more egregious provisions cited by movie executives
were:
</P>
<P>
   --- Cashman and DiGiampaolo select who will be hired as the
coordinator, captain and crew on individual productions. In
California and frequently in New York, the movie producer is able
to choose who will be hired for the positions.
</P>
<P>
   --- If the production office of a film is 25 miles or more
beyond the Charlestown headquarters of Local 25, the studio must
pay all Teamster crew members for the sixth and seventh day that
they are on the job even when they are idle. The assumption is that
they are too far from home to commute to the set. In addition to
the pay, the crew members have their hotel and meals paid for by
the studios during those days.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a negotiable item for me,'' O'Donnell said Friday.
``If the set is 200 miles away, then of course, we want our people
taken care of. But if it's not that far, then we can find a way to
work it out.''
</P>
<P>
   --- The coordinator and captain often rack up far more than the
25 hours of overtime that is built into their standard work week.
Under Local 25's contract, the workday for the coordinator and
captain begins the minute that the first person arrives on the set,
even if the two Teamster supervisors are still home in bed, and
they continue on the clock until the last person leaves the set for
the night.
</P>
<P>
   The New York union has a similar provision in its standard
contract, according to O'Donnell, but ``it's usually the first one
we talk about'' and ``seek compromise'' with the producers. In
addition, the Boston contract requires filmmakers to hire two
Teamster supervisors to oversee the drivers on the set, but neither
of them is required to drive any vehicles. The New York contract
mandates that only one Teamster supervisor, a captain, be hired to
oversee the drivers and often, according to O'Donnell, he will
handle driving responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cashman said in an interview earlier this week that he
wants to encourage more filmmakers to shoot in Massachusetts, movie
executives and others told The Globe that Local 25's hard-nosed
negotiation tactics have driven production studios, especially on
medium and smaller projects, to look to film in Canada or southern
states, where costs are lower.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it means less overall business for the state, there
are still enough major films being shot here to keep Cashman's
hand-picked crews working.

&HT;     GOP HOLDS THE LINE ON ABORTION PLANK 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By Dan Freedman  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Republicans on Friday rebuffed efforts by party
moderates to strike strong anti-abortion language from their
platform, ending a passionate but predictable debate on one of the
GOP's thorniest issues.
</P>
<P>
   However, unlike previous conventions when party elders did their
best to keep GOP abortion rights supporters at arms length,
pro-choice Republicans said the process this time around was much
more open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am thrilled. We were welcome for about 10 or 15 minutes,''
Ann Stone, chairwoman of Republicans for Choice, said after the
full platform committee voted in favor of keeping the anti-abortion
language. ``I'll tell you, that's progress. It was a great
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans for Choice is one of two groups spearheading the
latest bid to change the GOP platform's abortion plank. After the
committee defeat, pro-choice Republicans vowed to take their fight
to the convention floor on Monday when delegates take up the
platform. Among the options their exploring is submitting a
minority report to the platform that would express the party's
varied views on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the anti-abortion language called the pro-choice
Republicans sore losers. ``Democracy worked and they lost,'' said
Andrea Shelton Lafferty, executive director of the Tradition Values
Coalition, a conservative advocacy group. ``They don't understand
that yeah, they're welcome, but they still lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Language approved by the platform committee closely parallels
the 1996 platform. It endorses making opposition to abortion a
condition for nomination as a federal judge. And like the 1996
platform, this year's version calls for a constitutional amendment
banning abortion _ with no mention of exceptions for rape, incest
or the life and health of the mother.
</P>
<P>
   As it has for past GOP candidates, abortion is proving to be a
difficult issue for Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who will accept the
party's presidential nomination next Thursday night. On the one
hand, Bush has built his campaign around themes of inclusiveness,
openness and his self-styled image as a ``compassionate
conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other, Bush needs the support of foot soldiers among
religious conservatives and pro-life activists, all of whom
consider opposition to abortion to be among their top issues.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, platform committee
chair, has engaged in a carefully choreographed minuet with both
sides.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-abortion language reflects Bush's previously stated
promise to maintain the party as a pro-life bastion hospitable to
religious conservatives. But prior to Friday's platform committee
meetings, Thompson had met with Stone and other pro-choice
Republicans to assure them that although the odds were against
them, they'd have a fair chance to change the platform.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (STORY COULD END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;  Earlier Friday that chance largely fizzled as Toni Casey of
Los Altos Hills, Calif., one of 15 members of the ``Family and
Community'' subcommittee, moved to strike paragraphs supporting the
``human life'' amendment and appointing ``judges who respect ...
the sanctity of innocent human life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the right thing to do, and it is the right thing for the
Republican Party to do today,'' said Casey, a city council member
and former mayor of her town. ``We need a platform that recognizes
that abortion is a sensitive, delicate personal moral issue between
the woman and her own religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in opposition, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., a veteran
anti-abortion lawmaker on Capitol Hill, said the Republican Party
needed to maintain its status as advocate for ``unborn children.''
</P>
<P>
   With Democrats firmly in the pro-choice camp, ``it's left to
Republicans _ the heartless Republicans _ to care about the
defenseless unborn,'' Hyde said. ``I think saving unborn children
is a very noble cause.''
</P>
<P>
   By after an emotional debate, the subcommittee defeated Casey's
proposal to strike the abortion language. The subcommittee also
defeated an attempt by pro-choice Republicans to insert language
acknowledging that differing views on abortion exist within the
GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ``It defeats the purpose of the entire (platform) statement,''
said Rand Larson, a subcommittee delegate from Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-choice republicans then tried their luck before the full
platform committee but their motions were defeated again.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Thompson said that although the outcome was
never seriously in doubt, he had bent over backwards to assure
fairness.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's deliberations ``were very positive,'' Thompson said.
``We're still looking at ways to make sure everyone feels they're
included in the process, and we're going to continue to do that
until we wrap up Monday afternoon.'' Asked about the possibility of
a floor fight on abortion on Monday, Thompson said ``sure, I'd be
upset if it goes to the floor.'' If it does, ``I don't think I've
done my job,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the abortion plank, the subcommittee also
toughened language in opposition to gay rights. In addition to a
promise to ``energetically defend'' the 1996 Defense of Marriage
Act _ which says that states do not have to recognize same-sex
marriages performed in other states _ members inserted a statement
that federal civil rights law should not be extended to
discrimination based on sexual preference.
</P>
<P>
   They also inserted a pledge to ``stand united'' with the Boy
Scouts of America, which won a recent Supreme Court battle over its
dismissal of a scout troop leader who is gay.
</P>
<P>
   But in line with Bush's effort to appeal to Hispanic voters, the
platform committee softened 1996 language that called for denying
government benefits to illegal immigrants, as well as a
constitutional amendment denying citizenship to U.S.-born children
of illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 platform approved by the subcommittee Friday drops
those demands. It calls for splitting the Immigration and
Naturalization service into separate enforcement and immigration
processing entities, and an increase in H-1B visas for skilled
foreign-born workers in high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   In line with Bush's position, this year's education plank calls
for increased accountability and standards in schools to make sure
children are learning. It also drops the GOP's long-standing call
to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major shift from 1996,'' said Sen. Bill Frist,
R-Tenn., a platform committee co-chair. ``To me it shows maturation
in our understanding of how to educate children today.''

 &HT;    Let the music play _ Napster gets a stay
 &HT;    By Bob Keefe
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO - The music will go on at Napster Inc. _ at least
temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court Friday granted the online music company
a stay of an injuction that would have shut the company's popular
_and controversial _ Web site down at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   A two-judge panel ruled that Napster raised ``substantial''
questions about the merits and need for the injunction. Napster has
until Aug. 18 to file an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The injunction was ordered earlier this week by a federal judge
in San Francisco after she found that Napster's service violated
record companies' copyrights. She ordered the company to quit
letting visitors to its site swap music files that reside on their
own computers using Napster's file-sharing programs, which Napster
claimed would cause an entire shutdown of its business. The
injunction stemmed from a suit filed by the record company
tradegroup Recording Industry Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   As Napster's legal fight with the recording industry continues,
another online music company is making nice.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com Inc. has agreed to pay royalties and cash to settle a
copyright lawsuit filed by EMI Group in what MP3 officials
described as a sign of the online music industry's future.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the settlement were not made public, but reportedly
call for MP3.com to pay $20 million up front and royalties each
time an EMI-labeled song is downloaded from MP3.com's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``A business model where artists, copyright holders and record
companies can potentially monetize their music digitally . . . is
finally emerging,'' MP3.com Chairman Michael Robertson said in a
prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   It is the third such suit that San Diego-based MP3 has settled
since a federal judge in April ruled that the company violated
record companies' copyrights. It is still negotiating settlements
with two other record companies, Universal Music Group and Sony
Music Group.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courtroom, Napster showed signs Friday of warming up
to the recording industry too.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of encouraging a boycott of music companies and retail
stores that had been urged by tens of thousands of Napster fans
around the world, the Redwood City, Calif. company asked them to do
the opposite and buy CDs _ especially those of artists who favor of
Napster's file sharing program _ during a two-day ``buy-cott'' this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The ``buy-cott'' is aimed at bolstering Napster's argument that
its service actually encourages music listeners to buy music
instead of just taking it from free from other fans through
Napster's Web site.

TEAMSTERS IN NEW YORK MORE LENIENT WITH MOVIE MAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KURKJIAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A few months ago, a handful of television producers
filed into the office of the Teamsters Union chief who handles film
production in New York to protest the decisions of one Teamster
supervisor they felt were unfair and costing them too much money.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Thomas R. O'Donnell, the Teamster chief, ruled in
favor of the supervisor, the producers came away heartened that he
had considered their complaint and called the supervisor on the
carpet to explain himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just would not happen in Boston,'' said one producer who
was familiar with the meeting and asked not to be identified. ``In
Boston, there is rarely any effort to compromise or reach common
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell, who has headed the New York Teamsters' local that
contracts with the filmmakers for 40 years, stressed in an
interview Friday that his union is flexible in considering the
demands on cost and working conditions that the producers and other
executives make on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a happy medium to be struck here, and except for
wages, I am willing to consider any request that a filmmaker has,''
O'Donnell said. ``We're not to be doing anyone any favors by making
it so that they don't want to come back here. It just makes sense
in the long run to be flexible.''
</P>
<P>
   In discussing their reluctance to shoot more movies in
Massachusetts, studio executives and independent producers
inevitably emphasize the refusal of the Teamsters union in Boston,
Local 25, to compromise on key provisions in their lucrative,
benefit-laden contract. It is a contract that guarantees all
Teamsters 25 hours of overtime every week, which means the lowest
paid driver makes a minimum of $2,002 a week for the standard
65-hour work week, while the two top supervisors bring in $2,853
and $2,475 respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Filmmakers in New York pay Teamsters about as much for a week of
work as they do in Boston, but in New York the crews work a
standard 70-hour week, five more hours. Several filmmakers
interviewed recently said additional benefits in the Boston
contract, that Teamster President George Cashsman and Louis
DiGiampaolo, who negotiates the film contracts with the studios,
consider inviolable discourage them from coming to Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Teamster officials in Boston could not be reached for comment
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more egregious provisions cited by movie executives
were:
</P>
<P>
   --- Cashman and DiGiampaolo select who will be hired as the
coordinator, captain and crew on individual productions. In
California and frequently in New York, the movie producer is able
to choose who will be hired for the positions.
</P>
<P>
   --- If the production office of a film is 25 miles or more
beyond the Charlestown headquarters of Local 25, the studio must
pay all Teamster crew members for the sixth and seventh day that
they are on the job even when they are idle. The assumption is that
they are too far from home to commute to the set. In addition to
the pay, the crew members have their hotel and meals paid for by
the studios during those days.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a negotiable item for me,'' O'Donnell said Friday.
``If the set is 200 miles away, then of course, we want our people
taken care of. But if it's not that far, then we can find a way to
work it out.''
</P>
<P>
   --- The coordinator and captain often rack up far more than the
25 hours of overtime that is built into their standard work week.
Under Local 25's contract, the workday for the coordinator and
captain begins the minute that the first person arrives on the set,
even if the two Teamster supervisors are still home in bed, and
they continue on the clock until the last person leaves the set for
the night.
</P>
<P>
   The New York union has a similar provision in its standard
contract, according to O'Donnell, but ``it's usually the first one
we talk about'' and ``seek compromise'' with the producers. In
addition, the Boston contract requires filmmakers to hire two
Teamster supervisors to oversee the drivers on the set, but neither
of them is required to drive any vehicles. The New York contract
mandates that only one Teamster supervisor, a captain, be hired to
oversee the drivers and often, according to O'Donnell, he will
handle driving responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cashman said in an interview earlier this week that he
wants to encourage more filmmakers to shoot in Massachusetts, movie
executives and others told The Globe that Local 25's hard-nosed
negotiation tactics have driven production studios, especially on
medium and smaller projects, to look to film in Canada or southern
states, where costs are lower.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it means less overall business for the state, there
are still enough major films being shot here to keep Cashman's
hand-picked crews working.

INJURED HOCKEY PLAYER TAKES FIRST STEPS IN 4 1/2 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOSTON _ Slowly, but surely, John Gilpatrick placed one foot in
front of the other Friday and walked across the first-floor
function room. Confident he could successfully make the 30-foot
journey on his own, the former Suffolk University hockey player sat
down next to his mother and smiled.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty small steps for most, but a momentous and poignant giant
leap for the 27-year-old from Hanover.
</P>
<P>
   It has been 4 1/2 years since Gilpatrick was hit from behind
during a game, sending him head first into a goalpost causing a
devastating spinal cord injury that left him in a wheelcair, with
no use of his legs and right arm.
</P>
<P>
   But during a packed news conference at Suffolk University Law
School, Gilpatrick fought back tears as he talked of his
determination not to spend the rest of his days labeled as a person
with special needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot exactly explain it. One morning I woke up and told
myself I was going to walk,'' Gilpatrick said. ``The first six
months were hard, but I always got up in the morning. I never gave
up. With my step-father's help, I took my first steps, again.''
</P>
<P>
   Crediting a huge outpouring of good will, unwavering
perserverence and intense physical therapy, Gilpatrick recalled how
about a month ago he began to experience some pain, or what he
called a burning sensation, in his spine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes this burning is connected with positive return,''
Gilpatrick said. ``As you can see this return has allowed me to
stand unaided, and to walk.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilpatrick wanted to keep his good news a secret for a few more
weeks, but word of his success got out after he was seen walking
around town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it. My mouth dropped to the floor,'' said
Michael Murphy, 26, a lifelong friend who saw Gilpatrick walk
Monday. ``He just walked through my front door and said, `Hi.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gilpatrick's recovery also astonished Dr. David Apple, a
specialist in spinal cord injuries who treated Gilpatrick at the
Shepherd Center in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that a patient's best chances for recovery comes within
the first two years from when an injury is sustained.
</P>
<P>
   Gilpatrick's ability to take his first steps, Apple believes,
comes from a combination of hard work and sheer luck that his
spinal injury was not as bad as it could have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't do anything special, he did all the hard work,''
Apple said. ``The young man has a lot of determination.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilpatrick undergoes many hours of physical therapy every week
with the goal of improving his ability to walk.
</P>
<P>
   Gilpatrick became a quadriplegic on Jan. 25, 1996 after he
rushed to the net and was hit from behind, causing his head to
strike the goalpost and then whip backward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember watching it happen. He dropped right to the ice,''
recalled Suffolk head hockey coach Brian Horan, who was then the
team's assistant coach. ``I rushed out to him and he said, `Coach,
I can't feel anything.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gilpatrick's injury occurred on the same section of the ice at
the Walter Brown Arena where three months earlier Travis Roy was
paralyzed in his first game for Boston University when he lost his
balance and crashed head first into the boards.
</P>
<P>
   Gilpatrick said he kept in close touch with Roy, who was
paralyzed from the neck down, after meeting him while they were
both rehabilitating at the Shepherd Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walking is a little hard for me because I have so many friends
who remain paralyzed,'' Gilpatrick said. ``I keep telling them
never to give up. Doctors aren't always right.''
</P>
<P>
   For Gilpatrick, the 1996 accident, was the second major injury
Gilpatrick sufferend playing hockey. In 1989, as a sophomore at
Hanover High School, he broke his neck, leaving him paralyzed for
three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always worried about his safety, but there wasn't much
I could do,'' explained Elaine Jones, Gilpatrick's mother. ``My son
loves hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   But she also has come to admire another and ultimately, perhaps,
more important passion her son possesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been relentless in his pursuit to stand and walk,'' Jones
said. ``I'm very proud of John. I didn't think that he would walk.
He did.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilpatrick, who returned to school in September 1997 with the
help of Ice, his Rottweiler guide dog, was an assistant hockey
coach at the school. He received a bachelor's degree in criminal
justice last December and plans to attend Suffolk University Law
School next month.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to get back on the ice, Gilpatrick said he hopes to coach
hockey someday without the use of his wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm done with playing, but I would love to be on skates to
coach those guys,'' Gilpatrick said pointing to some team members
standing on the other side of the room.

PUTING THE LISTENER?

<TEXT>
<P>
   There are promising signs that Russian President Vladimir Putin
may be heeding Western objections to recurrent authoritarianism in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The most evident gesture in this direction was the dropping of
criminal charges against Vladimir Gusinsky, whose Media-Most
conglomerate controls papers, magazines, and broadcasting outlets
critical of established power. The official stance was that last
week's move came as a consequence of normal, independent
prosecutorial procedures. But the timing suggests that it was a
direct consequence of the criticism Putin heard from President
Clinton and other heads of state at the recent summit meeting of
the Group of Eight in Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   Less noticed abroad was the gangland-style murder Wednesday of
Sergey Novikov, the owner of an independent radio station in the
city of Smolensk. Novikov had discussed allegations of local
corruption on a TV program three days before and received death
threats earlier this year. The Committee to Protect Journalists has
sent a letter to Putin asking for a proper investigation of
Novikov's murder and punishment of those responsible.
</P>
<P>
   For Putin to establish the substance as well as the appearance
of a genuine rule of law in Russia, he must institute fair and
impartial justice for everyone. That means eliminating arbitrary or
political misuse of the legal system in Smolensk as well as Moscow,
for obscure cases as for those that receive international
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's meeting Friday with 21 so-called oligarchs may have been
another effort to respond to advice he received in Okinawa. The
parley suggests that he wants to create a level playing field for
economic players in Russia without exacerbating the capital flight
that has been a damaging side effect of the crony capitalism
tolerated by Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Even more encouraging was the disclosure that a Putin envoy is
negotiating with Chechnya's elected president, Aslan Maskhadov, for
the purpose of ending the brutal and futile warfare in the
Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   If these changes in Russian behavior are due to pressures from
the West, Russians and Westerners share an interest in keeping the
pressure up.

   XXX the other cases?
</P>
<P>
   SCHMIDT: I don't recall saying to the reporter I made
exceptions. I told him, I think what I just told you--he called me,
I didn't make a statement--but I did tell him what I just told you,
that, in this case, it seemed to me it wasn't going to undermine
our general policy and it would serve the purpose of putting to
rest a controversy and saving, you know, everybody, including the
taxpayers, the expense of having to litigate over it.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no other case I remember where I made an exception
to that policy.
</P>
<P>
   WILSON: So this was indeed the only case that went to the policy
you described earlier?
</P>
<P>
   (CROSSTALK)
</P>
<P>
   SCHMIDT: ... as a direct result of a case where the issue was
ever raised with me, but it was also the only case where I ever
made that exception.
</P>
<P>
   WILSON: Did you have any involvement in any other FOIA cases
while you were associate attorney general?
</P>
<P>
   SCHMIDT: Yes, occasionally if someone called and complained,
although it was rare--it was a part of the Justice Department that,
sort of, ran itself--but there were occasional cases where people
would call and complain. You're asking me for examples?
</P>
<P>
   WILSON: No, I'm just actually asking very specifically, were
there any other cases involving the policy to, neither to confirm
nor deny?
</P>
<P>
   SCHMIDT: No. I don't recall any other case where that issue was
raised with me.
</P>
<P>
   WILSON: Mr. Hogan, just before I get into this, you mentioned
that you did, at one time, let staff know, in the associate
attorney general's office, about this issue. Who did you contact?
</P>
<P>
   HOGAN: I now know--I didn't know this when we spoke a few weeks
ago, when my memory was so faded because, at that point, I had not
had a chance to look at documents--what I did is I called, when I
learned there was a potential appeal, Nancy McFadden (ph) was Mr.
Schmidt's top aide, and I let her know that there was an issue
coming.
</P>
<P>
   I did want her to look into whether or not they actually handled
appeals, the question you just asked Mr. Schmidt. At the time, I
did not know the answer to, and whether or not they would take an
appeal from Mr. Huff's office, and simply let her know that--to
make sure there was no misunderstanding, that I had no position on
the issue, and had simply played the traffic cop, sending her--you
know, Ms. Poston in her direction. Because I didn't want there to
be any misunderstanding as to what my role was.
</P>
<P>
   WILSON: Did you ask anybody in your associate attorney general's
office to meet with Ms. Poston.
</P>
<P>
   HOGAN: No, I simply said that Ms. Poston wanted to appeal. I
didn't know what the issue was, I didn't know how, what Mr. Huff's
power was vis-a-vis Mr. Schmidt, to be completely honest. And so I
said, ``Look into the issue of whether or not this is an appeal
that you'd want to take. I don't know what your procedures are.''
</P>
<P>
   I simply knew that I wasn't going to be involved in it, and I
wanted to let her know that there was no misunderstanding, that I
had no position.
</P>
<P>
   WILSON: Ms. Poston, prior to your actually lodging the FOIA
request, did you have an expectation that the Justice Department
would grant your request?
</P>
<P>
   POSTON: I thought at the beginning it would be difficult because
I was making a request for a record for someone I did not
represent. In all my past FOIA experiences I had represented the
party whose record I was seeking. But then when I got the
memorandum from Wilmer Cutler that the Privacy Act did not apply to
foreign nationals, then I felt that I had a good legal argument.
</P>
<P>
   WILSON: OK, Mr. Hogan, you mentioned earlier that there was a
prospect--or Mr. Schmidt, you also mentioned it, there was the
prospect of litigation in this case. Mr. Schmidt, would the
litigation have been successful if Steel Hector and Davis had
litigated to obtain this (inaudible)?
</P>
<P>
   SCHMIDT: I don't think so, based upon Mr. Huff had told me. I
think he thought we had a very defensible position. My view, as I
indicated before, was there was no point in litigating over
something that didn't exist, so we could avoid the issue. And I
didn't really get into the issue beyond talking to Mr. Huff.
</P>
<P>
   But I think he was comfortable that we had a defensible basis
for refusing to disclose any information here.
</P>
<P>
   WILSON: Mr. Huff, would a plaintiff have been able to prevail,
asking for the record that Ms. Poston asked for in this case?
</P>
<P>
   HUFF: I think it would be very unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   WILSON: Very unlikely?
</P>
<P>
   If you could, Mr. Huff, just--we'll start at the beginning of
this, if you could explain very briefly, because you want to get
out of here and we don't have much time, what is the Justice
Department policy regarding the confirmation or denial of criminal
records about a third person?
</P>
<P>
   I mean, we understand that if you go and ask for a record that
pertains to yourself, you have access to that, but if I were to go
and ask for somebody else's criminal record, what is the Justice
Department's policy?
</P>
<P>
   HUFF: Generally, we would refuse to confirm or deny whether or
not such records existed. There are a few exceptions to that. If
the subject of the request is deceased, or if the subject of the
request has consented to it, or if the Department of Justice has
officially made--you know, ``Do you have any records on John
Hinckley Jr.?'' ``Yes, we do.''
</P>
<P>
   WILSON: Now is this policy in place for non-citizens as well as
United States citizens?
</P>
<P>
   HUFF: That has been our general practice. Yes, there are
exceptions where we have not followed it for non-citizens.
</P>
<P>
   WILSON: Now why is this policy in place?
</P>
<P>
   HUFF: Generally, it is to protect the privacy of an individual
who does have a law enforcement record about him, or her, where
that fact is not previously been officially confirmed by the
department, or one of the other circumstances that I mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   WILSON: Now, my understanding, from having spoken with you
before, is that, if there was a situation where people who came and
asked for records pertaining to third parties, and there were no
records, and the department confirmed that there was no record, if
the policy was consistently applied, then when there was a record
the department would not be able to reply that there was no record,
and so it would be tantamount to confirming there was a record. Is
that the basic explanation?
</P>
<P>
   HUFF: If we did that in all cases, certainly that would be so.
</P>
<P>
   WILSON: Now--I mean, we've heard today, Ms. Poston, that,
briefly, but, is it true that your initial FOIA requests for Mr.
Abe's records were rejected...
</P>
<P>
   POSTON: No.
</P>
<P>
   WILSON: ... at the Department of Justice with--the FOIA request
at main Justice?
</P>
<P>
   POSTON: Well, when you say main Justice, you don't include
Immigration and you don't include Bureau of Prisons?
</P>
<P>
   WILSON: I'm not including
</P>
<P>
   POSTON: Oh, then the answer is yes.
</P>
<P>
   WILSON: Now, having read some of the paper, Mr. Huff, Ms. Poston
argued that her FOIA request should be granted because of the
public interest in Mr. Abe's arrest record, and because the Privacy
Act did not apply to a foreign national. Why did you reject her
appeal? Did those arguments carry any water with you?
</P>
<P>
   HUFF: Well, she was certainly right with regard to the Privacy
Act. But, as a general proposition, aliens have privacy interests
as well that are protectable, and under the Freedom of Information
Act that information can be protected. It's--certainly, under the
FOIA, we are required to assert exemptions. In fact, that's the
whole idea behind discretion.
</P>
<P>
   WILSON: I'll just yield for a moment to the chairman of the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   BURTON: Something's been kind of bothering me, Mr. Hogan. You're
the chief of staff for the attorney general?
</P>
<P>
   HUFF: Yes, I was.
</P>
<P>
   BURTON: Yes, you were. Why would you even call Mr. Schmidt to
tell him that you weren't taking any position that he might be
contacted by Ms. Poston?
</P>
<P>
   HUFF: I did not contact Mr. Schmidt. I never spoke to Mr.
Schmidt. I called his staff.
</P>
<P>
   BURTON: Well, why would you do that?
</P>
<P>
   HUFF: Simply to let them know that--I wanted to make sure they
understood that if my name was used in any way that it wasn't, that
I had taken no position on the case.
</P>
<P>
   BURTON: Well, wouldn't they, if they got a call from Ms. Poston
or anybody, and said, you know, ``Hogan said that you ought to help
us or something,'' wouldn't they have called you to confirm that?
</P>
<P>
   HUFF: I would assume so, but I...
</P>
<P>
   BURTON: Then why would you have to call in the first place?
</P>
<P>
   HUFF: I did it in an abundance of caution, sir, so there would
be absolutely no misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
   BURTON: When the chief of staff for the attorney general of the
United States calls somebody who's a subordinate in the Justice
Department or one of their staff people, the tone of voice, voice
inflection, no matter what it is, can convey all kinds of things,
and just by virtue of the fact that you called, it could have
meant, you know, ``She's going to call, and, you know, do what you
can for her.''
</P>
<P>
   HUFF: Just the opposite, sir. I said I don't know if you...
</P>
<P>
   BURTON: Have you made calls like that in the past?
</P>
<P>
   HUFF: Yes, sir.
</P>
<P>
   BURTON: For other people, where they called you and said, you
know, ``We would like something,'' and you called and said, ``You
may be getting a call...''
</P>
<P>
   HUFF: If there's ever any misunderstanding as to what I have
done, I would attempt to clarify it. Ms. McFadden (ph), who was Mr.
Schmidt's main assistant, was a very seasoned lawyer, a very
competent woman. All I wanted to make sure that she understood was,
that even as to whether or not they heard this, I had no opinion.
</P>
<P>
   BURTON: OK, but this has happened before? You called like that
before, on other issues?
</P>
<P>
   HUFF: If someone--if I was concerned that someone would
misunderstand what the role--my role had been in something, yes, I
would clarify it. Just for the reasons you said, sir.
</P>
<P>
   BURTON: I know, but you would do it without them initiating a
call to you?
</P>
<P>
   HUFF: In some cases, yes.
</P>
<P>
   BURTON: OK. Thank you.
</P>
<P>
   WILSON: Just for following up on that, Mr. Hogan, have you ever
made a call on a Freedom of Information Act request before?
</P>
<P>
   HUFF: Had I ever made a...
</P>
<P>
   WILSON: A call to anybody else in the Department of Justice
about somebody else's Freedom of Information Act request?
</P>
<P>
   HUFF: The only other calls I had made were--Mr. Huff's staff
would routinely consult me on FOIA issues. There are certain things
that, statutorily, if some document was a former attorney general
office document, and there was a FOIA issue with it, they would
have to go to our office, just like they would go to a component,
and occasionally Mr. Huff's deputy would call me and I would call
her back, and it dealt with FOIA issues.
</P>
<P>
   So, yes, I have made phone calls on FOIA issues before. I rely
very heavily on Mr. Huff and his staff as to the law, because I
don't perceive myself as an expert in that area. But yes, I have
made phone calls on FOIA issues...
</P>
<P>
   WILSON: Now, what I'm trying to get at here, not FOIA requests
for information from the Office of the Attorney General, or
pertaining to yourself or your records, the attorney general's
records, but on a matter that goes to a Freedom of Information Act
request about a third party that's not in the Department of
Justice.
</P>
<P>
   HUFF: When this was pending--I'm not even sure--until I sat here
this morning, I was never even really clear that this even was a
third-party issue. I knew it was a FOIA request. I sent it to the
FOIA people. I never focused on what the issue was.
</P>
<P>
   So, any time I would get a phone call on FOIA, I'd simply send
it to the career lawyers who handle the FOIA issues. I never got
involved in the substance of them.
</P>
<P>
   WILSON: But, just so I can...
</P>
<P>
   HUFF: I guess what I'm saying is, I don't know the answer to
your question because I never focused on what the issues were, and
your question just had a specific issue contained in it, and I
don't know. If I had a FOIA question from someone outside the
department, I sent it to Mr. Huff's staff.
</P>
<P>
   That was whether it was a situation where, like, Ms. Poston
called me, it was whether I picked up the phone and some citizen
from somewhere in the United States had a question about FOIA and,
you know, what went wrong; I sent them all to Mr. Huff's office,
and I simply--they were the career people who handled those
matters, that's where I would send anyone who had a FOIA issue.
</P>
<P>
   WILSON: Well, I understand your answer as far as a basic FOIA
request, but I'm trying to pare away and determine whether you--and
I'll go to the--sort of the bottom line of the concern here is that
you're the chief of staff to the attorney general of the United
States, which is not the first place a FOIA request is lodged. It
requires getting through certain traps to get to you.
</P>
<P>
   And whereas I can understand questions coming to you that
pertain to FOIA requests that go to documents that are important to
the Department of Justice--your documents, the attorney general's
documents--it does seem a little unusual for you to take any phone
calls at all about a Freedom of Information Act request about
something else that's outside of the department. And I just didn't
get a firm sense of the answer on that.
</P>
<P>
   HOGAN: The reason I took the call--when Rebekah--when I got a
message Rebekah Poston's on the phone, I knew who she was, I--she
was an acquaintance, I don't--you know, the definition of
``friends'' is a nebulous one--but I knew who she was, I took the
call.
</P>
<P>
   She began explaining she had a problem with FOIA. I said, Oh,
FOIA, it needs to go to, you know, to a certain office within the
department. I didn't--I told her--she asked me questions like, as I
recall, Do you know Tom Kelly (ph), who's a lawyer in the FBI? And
I said, Yes, I know him, but if you have a question with main
Justice and there's a FOIA issue it goes to Mr. Huff's office. I
simply did not get involved in it. I did not go into the substance.
</P>
<P>
   She tried to make her case about the administration policy of
openness and the attorney general's policy of openness and I
simply--my response was, I don't get involved in FOIA issues, you
need to talk to the career people who handle those issues. And I
just--I just sent her on her way.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when it later came to an appeal, that was the first time
that I knew of an appeal coming from Mr. Huff's office, and so to
some extent, if there's a uniqueness here, I don't remember ever
getting a call about that before. But again, I would simply pass on
the information.
</P>
<P>
   WILSON: OK. Just to clarify one thing. You mentioned, not
precisely in these words, but the definition of ``friends'' is a
nebulous term. And when we called you we didn't get a very
sense--very good sense of any connection or past relationship
between yourself and Ms. Poston.
</P>
<P>
   Is it true that when Hurricane Andrew came through Miami you
invited Ms. Poston and her friend to come live in your house--and
her sister to come live in your house?
</P>
<P>
   HOGAN: Let me explain. Thank you very much for that opportunity.
There are so many things that are just not clear.
</P>
<P>
   Her sister was a secretary in the state attorney's office and
she was in charge of all homicide victims and just did a wonderful
job. She was a single mother who just really was a very impressive
person. Although she was never my secretary, she was someone who
I've always admired.
</P>
<P>
   I knew that she lived on Miami Beach. When Hurricane Andrew was
approaching Miami I called her and said, ``Lookit, they're saying
that Miami Beach needs to be evacuated, Bobbi (ph), if you need a
place to stay, I live inland, you're more than welcome to come to
my house.'' And she said, ``Well, my sister also lives on the
shore, could she come, too?'' And I did not say, ``No, she has to
stay out in the storm.'' I said, ``Yes, she can come, too.''
</P>
<P>
   My contact with Ms. Poston had always been through her sister,
you know. Her sister's office desk was near my office, I would come
out occasionally, they would be going to lunch together, she would
introduce me, I'd say, Hi, Rebekah, how are you? That was really
the sum total of my contact with Ms. Poston before this happened.
</P>
<P>
   So I did say to her sister that Ms. Poston could come to my
house in the hurricane. The great irony was they didn't come and my
house was destroyed and her house was fine.
</P>
<P>
   WILSON: When this FOIA matter was in--at the Department of
Justice, it's our understanding that it had been resolved to the
point where there was no possibility of appeal, or at least the
final appellate step had been taken within the Department of
Justice. Was that your--do you recall whether you had an
understanding of that at the time?
</P>
<P>
   HOGAN: I'm sorry, could you repeat that, sir?
</P>
<P>
   WILSON: That when this FOIA request was in the Department of
Justice it had gone to Mr. Huff and he had rejected--there was an
appeal to him and he had rejected the appeal and the matter was
effectively closed within the FOIA office. Is that your
understanding of what happened had happened?
</P>
<P>
   HOGAN: I knew that--I had a sense that--and again, mainly from
messages from that I'm not even sure of what the information--that
eventually he ruled against Ms. Poston's position. I did not know
whether that was final or not, and that was one of the questions
that I posed to Ms. McFadden (ph), that she should look into
whether or not there was a right of appeal for Mr. Huff?
</P>
<P>
   WILSON: If I could, just up put exhibit 30 for a moment on the
screen. And this is a letter dated April 25, 1995, and it's
the--it's a letter to Ms. Poston from Mr. Huff. And there are four
things that I wanted to pull out of this letter.
</P>
<P>
   In the first paragraph it says, ``I note that you have not
furnished a notarized authorization from Mr. Abe.''
</P>
<P>
   The second point, in the second paragraph, ``I find the Supreme
Court's holding to be controlling in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   And then further in that paragraph it says, ``Lacking an
individual's consent, proof of death, official acknowledgement of
an investigation or an overriding public interest, even to
acknowledge the existence of law enforcement records pertaining to
an individual could reasonably be expected to constitute an
unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   And then at the end of the first page and going on to the second
page it says, ``Accordingly, this office is unable to assist you in
this matter at this time and I am closing these administrative
appeals in this office.''
</P>
<P>
   I mean, this--Mr. Huff, when we first read this, it seems like a
fairly unambiguous response to the FOIA request. In our opinion,
was this decision a close call?
</P>
<P>
   HUFF: No.
</P>
<P>
   WILSON: If one were to argue that based on--well, let me ask
this question this way. When the decision was made by Mr. Schmidt
to provide Ms. Poston the information that she was requesting, did
that constitute a change of policy at the Department of Justice?
</P>
<P>
   HUFF: I don't think it was a change of policy, I think it was an
exception in this case because of the circumstances in this case
where Mr. Schmidt said he had looked at the policy, Attorney
General Reno's disclosure policy.
</P>
<P>
   WILSON: What were the--what were the circumstances that made
this case worthy of a change of direction?
</P>
<P>
   HUFF: He mentioned during our conversation the risk of
litigation and the time that litigation would take, but that was...
</P>
<P>
   WILSON: Is that, Mr. Schmidt, is that a fair characterization,
that it was the concern about litigation that led you to make the
decision you made?
</P>
<P>
   SCHMIDT: Well, that was certainly a factor. Again, I wouldn't
accept the characterization there was a change in policy. I think
Mr. Huff has it exactly right, there was an exception to the
policy. In the circumstance where we had discovered it we didn't
have any records, I mean that is the key element here, and so we
were not disclosing any records, there was no argument that we were
depriving anybody of their privacy rights, and we had the ability
to do something totally harmless that thereby put to rest a matter
and avoided the need for any further controversy about it. And that
seemed to me then and still seems to me the sensible thing to in
those circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   BURTON: So let me just interrupt here. It is an exception to the
accepted policy. You don't tell people when they ask about criminal
records with a FOIA request whether you have them, don't have them,
you don't tell them anything.
</P>
<P>
   SCHMIDT: That's correct. You don't have a general policy of
confirming or denying.
</P>
<P>
   BURTON: So why--and so why the exception? I just--it's lost...
</P>
<P>
   SCHMIDT: Because we had found ourselves here in a situation
where we were confronted with not just the potential, but I think
the likelihood of having to litigate over this matter. We had
discovered that we in fact had no records.
</P>
<P>
   BURTON: Well, let me ask...
</P>
<P>
   SCHMIDT: And by disclosing the fact that we had no records, we
could completely put an end to the matter and avoid spending
anybody's time or effort or money litigating.
</P>
<P>
   BURTON: Taxpayers' money. But let's say that you have 100 cases
like this where people threaten with litigation, are you going to
do that with all...
</P>
<P>
   SCHMIDT: But we didn't. I would agree with you, if you had 100
or 1,000 like this you might have to come to a different result.
But we had one case which we could completely put to rest by making
a completely harmless and lawful disclosure of the fact that we had
no records. So it seemed to me, for me, frankly, in terms of the
overall interests of the department, easy to conclude that it was a
sensible conclusion not to unnecessarily litigate over something
that didn't exist.
</P>
<P>
   BURTON: How do you account for the fact, and maybe you just have
to speculate on this, how do you account for the fact that this
investigator, the private investigator who was looking into this,
Mister--what was the gentleman's name?
</P>
<P>
   (UNKNOWN): Manuel.
</P>
<P>
   BURTON: Mr. Manuel said that the records had been purged.
</P>
<P>
   SCHMIDT: I mean, all I know about that is what I learned from
having listened to the hearing this morning. I know nothing about
any of that. And I don't know what it means, I don't know--I don't
know how it happened, if it happened. And, you know, I know nothing
about any of that.
</P>
<P>
   BURTON: I understand, but you could see why that raises a
question with us.
</P>
<P>
   SCHMIDT: Oh, I could see how your definition of ``purged''...
</P>
<P>
   BURTON: I know, but...
</P>
<P>
   SCHMIDT: ... sounded more like mine than the one you were
getting from that particular witness, but I--where that leads you,
you know, in terms of...
</P>
<P>
   BURTON: No, but the point is this. We see these documents and
they raise all kinds of questions and it says it's been purged, and
then we find that you have made an exception to a rule that's been
around or a policy that's been around for a long, long time because
you say that you're concerned about possible litigation. And it
just...
</P>
<P>
   SCHMIDT: It seems to me you're connecting, you know, apples to
oranges in a way that doesn't, in fact, connect. My decision had
nothing to do with whether anything had or hadn't been purged...
</P>
<P>
   BURTON: No, I understand that.
</P>
<P>
   SCHMIDT: ... because none of us--I don't think Mr. Huff or
anybody else knew anything about any of that. All we were deciding
was what to do in a situation where we had found out we didn't have
any record and, you know, should we go on arguing or should we put
the matter to rest by disclosing that fact.
</P>
<P>
   BURTON: If you have a case like this in the future would you do
the same thing?
</P>
<P>
   SCHMIDT: Well, I'm no longer there, but if I had this case under
these circumstances in the future, yes, I would. It seemed to me
right then, it still seems to me right.
</P>
<P>
   WILSON: Just one of the concerns that brings us to this matter
and this panel here is to try and determine whether--what the
policy is to the extent it can be determined. And it sounds to me,
and you can help me with this, Mr. Schmidt, it sounds to me like
the clearest articulation of the status quo now is that if somebody
wants criminal records about a third party and they threaten
litigation and there aren't records the Department of Justice will
provide them an answer. Is that a fair articulation of the policy?
</P>
<P>
   SCHMIDT: No. I think that the policy remains that as a general
policy we don't confirm or deny the existence of records. And I
would say that if you want to state as a general policy, that there
are occasional exceptions in circumstances where the disclosure of
the nonexistence of records is harmless and it allows us to avoid
what otherwise appears to be an imminent threat of significant
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   WILSON: But that--I mean, I understand what you say, but your
answer is somewhat--it doesn't follow. If I go to the Department of
Justice tomorrow and I work through the process and I get to the
final decision maker and I'm rejected and I get a bigger
and--forgive--well, just a bigger law firm than Steel Hector and
Davis or any other sort of large, well thought of law firm, and I
say, ``Look, you know, the Privacy Act doesn't apply, I want this
record,'' then how could you distinguish my request from Ms.
Poston's request?
</P>
<P>
   SCHMIDT: Well, I would distinguish it. I don't think this was a
case where someone was coming in and simply litigating as part of a
strategy to undermine a general Justice Department policy of
neither confirming nor denying the existence of records. This was
litigation that was clearly substantial--although I think Mr. Huff,
based on everything I know, is correct, we would have won it--but
there were real issues here about the extent...
</P>
<P>
   WILSON: They wanted the record. I mean, that's...
</P>
<P>
   SCHMIDT: No, no, no, but the extent to which aliens under these
circumstances had or hadn't a right to privacy and under what
circumstances therefore someone asserting a FOIA request could
override what at least Ms. Poston and her clients would say was a
nonexistent right (inaudible). This was real litigation. So I don't
think it's fair to suggest that we're somehow creating a scenario
where everyone would be free to come in and by the mere threat of
litigation undermine the longstanding policy.
</P>
<P>
   And I'd come back to you--if that began to happen, then I would
abandon the policy of making exceptions. But until it happened, I
see no reason to spend taxpayers' money and the resources of the
Justice Department litigating unnecessarily over something that
doesn't exist.
</P>
<P>
   BURTON: Mr. Schmidt, if you didn't know all the facts of this
particular case how would you know whether or not divulging that
you had no information or some information in the file would affect
the case?
</P>
<P>
   (CROSSTALK)
</P>
<P>
   SCHMIDT: Well, I have no idea whether it would affect the case.
All I know is that because we had no records there was no one whose
privacy rights were going to be violated. And we didn't make the
decision to do anything here until we found out that we had no
records. So I had no idea and don't whether it was going to be
positive or negative for this case. All I mean is in terms of the
interests that the FOIA law and the privacy law were protecting, it
was harmless because there in fact were no records being disclosed
and therefore we weren't depriving anybody of their privacy rights.
</P>
<P>
   WILSON: Does anybody--we'll just change course for a minute
here--does anybody on this panel know why the attorney general
recused herself in this specific case?
</P>
<P>
   HOGAN: I do.
</P>
<P>
   WILSON: Mr. Hogan, if you could tell us briefly.
</P>
<P>
   HOGAN: Thank you. I have had a chance to look at record since we
spoke.
</P>
<P>
   I spoke--although I normally did not take Ms. Poston's
call--it's somewhat awkward to sit here and say that, but that's
what happened, I did not take her calls--occasionally I would pick
up the phone when my secretary was busy and occasionally I would
speak to her. I remember having a conversation with her at one
point and I think she clearly was frustrated, I think, with the
fact that she was not--her position was not gaining momentum within
the department, and she mentioned to me that she was handling the
matter with a man by the name of John Edward Smith (ph). And I knew
John Edward Smith (ph)--he has recently died--but I knew him to be
a friend of the attorney general.

ANTIMISSILE MADNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 30, 2000)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the sake of an antimissile system that independent
scientists say can never work, politicians and defense bureaucrats
are willing to spend $60 billion and imperil the 1972 ABM treaty
that has been a cornerstone of strategic stability. They are also
prepared to alienate America's allies, to goad China into enlarging
and modernizing its deterrent force of 20 ICBMs, and, after the
folly subsides, to leave Americans less secure than they were
before.
</P>
<P>
   These are the obvious symptoms of the antimissile malady. But a
new variety appeared recently, when Democratic Senator Kent Conrad
of North Dakota, who wants the first 20 interceptors of the
proposed missile defense system located in his state rather than
Alaska, where they are now slated to go, suggested that if a system
sited in North Dakota would leave unprotected the few residents of
Alaska's Aleutian Island chain or the uninhabited outer islands of
Hawaii, it would make sense to compensate the unshielded.
</P>
<P>
   Said Conrad: ``Are we really going to say we aren't going to
protect the whole rest of the country because of the 1,500 people
in the Aleutian chain, who could be offered a generous buyout
package?''
</P>
<P>
   To Alaska's Republican senator, Frank Murkowski, this heartless
triage was intolerable. Alaskans, he warned, ``aren't willing to
sell our right to be defended.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a word from either senator about the defense contracts or
the jobs that the antimissile boondoggle might bring to their
states.
</P>
<P>
   It is evident from their unseemly quarrel that neither
legislator has heard the bad news about the inability of the
system's sensors to discriminate between warheads in space and
Mylar balloons serving as decoys. But Conrad did have a point when
he justified his buyout scheme for Aleutian islanders ``in light of
the fact that it would make no strategic sense for them to be a
target in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   This was one of the few rational remarks uttered since the onset
of missile-defense madness.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Short of violence in the streets involving the throngs of
protesters coming to Philadelphia, the Republican National
Convention opening this week is not likely to galvanize America's
attention. Cynical, alienated, too busy making money or
vacationing, most voters have better things to do than watch a
tightly scripted infomercial for either party. A new poll by the
Pew Research Center for the People &AMP; the Press records a sickening
dive of public interest in the GOP convention since 1992: from 53
percent to 44 percent in 1996 to 34 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom has it that low participation helps the
Republican Party, since its natural base is a smaller group of more
motivated, better-educated, wealthier voters. It is true that since
the Reagan years the GOP has managed to hold in coalition two
fractious wings: traditional business interests and social-issue
activists from a poorer, more ethnic, more Southern population. But
that still leaves out a lot of America. The challenge for the
Republican Party is to make real its ``big tent'' rhetoric and use
the convention to broaden its base.
</P>
<P>
   There is some reason for optimism. The Republican platform
committee, hewing to the instructions of its nominee-in-waiting,
George W. Bush, has toned down much of the harsh rhetoric in the
party's planks on affirmative action and education. And convention
managers promise there will be no organized Democrat-bashing, which
has turned off voters in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is no substitute for substance. The Republicans
could do the most to attract the vast middle of the country to
their cause with solid, workable programs on health care,
education, and the environment _ not by squandering an
unprecedented surplus on more tax cuts for the richest Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The payoff for a genuine effort would be nothing less than the
revival of American democracy _ a president elected by a real
majority. When less than 50 percent of voting age Americans bother
to cast ballots and less than 50 percent of those vote for the
winner _ this was Bill Clinton's sorry position in 1992 _ it is
hard to claim a true victory, much less a mandate.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MIAMI _ As an unshaven Isaac Rosenberg stood blindfolded, hungry
and dirty, he wondered what would become of his life in his native
Colombia.
 &HT;    The then-25-year-old was held in isolation for four months after
being kidnapped from his home in Bogota in 1988. Finally, he
``worked something out'' with his kidnappers and was released.
 &HT;    ``It was a real turning point in my life,'' he says.
 &HT;    The following year, Rosenberg sold his family's decades-old
soap-making business Elefante La Llave to Anglo-Dutch multinational
conglomerate Unilever for an undisclosed amount. Soon after,
Rosenberg headed for the United States to start a new life.
 &HT;    The 37-year-old Colombian is now building a new empire based on
fruit and vegetables. His Miami-based company, Fashion Fruit,
imports specialty produce _ from asparagus to mangos to zucchini _
from Latin America. The company operates the service year-round,
meaning New Yorkers can stir-fry fresh Guatemalan snow peas while
snowflakes are falling outside and residents of arid Arizona can
plop fresh raspberries atop their ice cream any time of the year.
He expects his sales to approach US$10 million this year.
 &HT;    Starting over wasn't easy for the silver-spooned scion. As the
heir to his family's multimillion dollar soap business, Rosenberg
had lived a privileged life up until his kidnapping _ a U.S.
education (at Northeastern University in Boston), a big house in
Bogota and all the other trappings of a wealthy Latin American. ``I
was never that motivated in school because I had my life already
planned,'' he says.
 &HT;    The plan included taking over the family business that had its
roots in Moldavia before World War II. Rosenberg's grandparents
launched the business in the 1930s, building it into a sizable
operation until the Soviets invaded the small European country and
confiscated the family's factory. Caught between communist
repression and a possible Nazi invasion, the Rosenbergs fled
Europe. To obtain the necessary exit visa, the Jewish family traded
its secret recipe for making soap.
 &HT;    The once thriving entrepreneurs boarded a boat headed for the
Panama Canal in 1939 with nothing but a suitcase crammed full of
clothes. The family landed in Panama, but the search for a suitable
place to build a factory soon took them to nearby Colombia. The
country offered a large population, strong dependence on imported
soap and a more hospitable climate than that of steamy Panama.
 &HT;    Now, decades later, third-generation Isaac Rosenberg has
repeated the past, following in his grandparents' footsteps by
leaving his homeland in search of a better life. ``I saw Colombia
changing for the worse and I did not want to raise a family in that
environment,'' he says.
 &HT;    Even after being kidnapped, the decision to leave Colombia was
not as obvious for Rosenberg as it was for his grandparents. ``It
would have been much easier for me to stay,'' he says. ``I was a
big fish in a small pond. The banks knew me and doors would always
open very fast.''
 &HT;    Rosenberg's first destination was New York City, where he began
working in 1990 as a research analyst at investment bank Westsphere
Capital, which courted wealthy South Americans eyeing investments
in U.S.-based start-up companies. While on a trip home to Colombia,
Rosenberg made friends with one of the bank's clients who had a
strawberry farm on the side. The client asked Rosenberg if he could
find some buyers in the United States. ``I found him buyers so
quickly that he decided to hire me as a partner,'' Rosenberg says.
 &HT;    As he learned more about the produce business, Rosenberg
recognized a niche market for specialty imports during the winter
months stateside. He quit his job and started his own company,
Fashion Fruit, in 1991.
 &HT;    It was hardly a cakewalk. While Rosenberg was able to fund the
business with proceeds from the sale of his family's soap-making
business, he had to arrange financing for growers in Latin America
_ which was difficult because many of them didn't have assets to
speak of. He also had to hire marketing people in Miami who could
woo longtime food distributors who already had steady suppliers.
Then there were the years of overproduction, when his profit
margins were squeezed. ``Markets go up and down and I can't predict
what's going to happen,'' he says.
 &HT;    The decision to leave Colombia is now paying off. He lives in a
well-to-do neighborhood north of Miami, has an American wife,
Deborah (whom he met at Northeastern), and loves his job. The
company has grown from one employee in 1991 to 10 employees today.
This year, he expects to bring more than 1 million boxes of fruit
and vegetables into the United States, each carrying an average
price tag of US$10 a box. He predicts the company will grow another
50 percent next year, as he works to expand his specialty produce
to the Asian and European markets. He also plans on launching a Web
site to tie into wholesalers.
 &HT;    Finding a niche was the key to success, Rosenberg says. ``My
father was involved in everything from the soap business to
restaurants to real estate to distributing powdered milk in
Colombia,'' he says. ``Here, you cannot be a jack-of-all-trades;
the market is too sophisticated for that.''
 &HT;    It also helps to have good relations with your suppliers. ``We
chose Isaac because as a Latin, he speaks our language and
understands our needs,'' says Antonio Maldonado, who has his own
snow pea-growing business in Guatemala and sells most of his
produce through Rosenberg. ``We depend on him to get our products
sold in this extremely competitive market.''
 &HT;    Rosenberg is now focused on building his business and
identifying new opportunities throughout the region. His most
recent adventure included a trip to Havana last April with the
Young Entrepreneurs' Organization to meet with government officials
and make contacts in preparation for a post-embargo Cuba.
 &HT;    With the U.S. government's softening stance on Cuba,
opportunities for food and medical imports to the Caribbean island
continue to emerge. Rosenberg acknowledges that a Cuba without
barriers would do wonders for his business. But he makes clear he
would not export products from Cuba. ``The fruit there is no good.
Cuba lacks pesticides, it lacks resources, it lacks everything,''
he says.
 &HT;    Instead, if the embargo is lifted, Rosenberg envisions shipping
fruit and vegetables to tourist spots on the island. With nine
years of experience under his belt, Rosenberg is confident he can
meet the often capricious needs of foreign tourists in Cuba.
``Europeans will only eat white asparagus and Americans won't eat
strawberries unless they're bright red,'' he says.
 &HT;    What's the biggest difference between doing business in the
United States versus Latin America? ``In the United States you make
it because of who you are, not because of what your last name is,''
he says. Given what he's managed to do in such a short time, he's
obviously adapted quickly.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On Wednesday delegates to the Republican National
Convention will hear Dick Cheney give his acceptance speech as the
party's vice presidential nominee. That is if they don't get
distracted by the smell of sausage-and-pepper subs from Paul
Cellucci's nearby ``Carnevale Italiano.''
</P>
<P>
   The South Philadelphia Italian street festival, being hosted by
the Massachusetts governor, is one of hundreds of
corporate-sponsored parties at this year's Republican and
Democratic conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Once aimed at nominating the presidential tickets, the party
gatherings have been transformed into a $100 million Super Bowl of
Schmooze.
</P>
<P>
   In Cellucci's case, the street festival was conceived to
increase ethnic support for Cheney and the GOP's presidential
nominee, Texas Governor George W. Bush. ``We're calling it the
`Paisanapalooza,''' said Cellucci spokeswoman Anne Gavin.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, corporations are sponsoring lavish parties _ with
tax-deductible donations, all aimed at influential lawmakers and
party figures. They are also kicking in the goods, from 400 cars
courtesy of General Motors to pagers from Motorola to 21,500 gifts
bags from Verizon Communications, the wireless communications giant
formed by the merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts delegates will be feted at brunches and receptions
sponsored by FleetBank, John Hancock, CVS and NStar, parent company
of Boston Edison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of being exercises in democracy, these gatherings have
turned into glorified money drops for special interests,'' said
Scott Harshbarger, president of Common Cause and former attorney
general of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The donors see it quite differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft supports the political process and believes that the
nominating conventions are an important part of that process,''
said Rick Miller, spokesman for the software maker. Miller denied
the company, which is donating an estimated $750,000 to each
convention in cash and computer support, is trying to affect the
outcome of its antitrust court fight with the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave in '96, so our giving to these conventions predates
the trial,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling the money flow is the rising cost of conventions and
changes in fund-raising laws that allow the donations.
</P>
<P>
   Each party is expected to spend over $50 million on its
gathering, up from $30 million-35 million in 1996. The US Treasury
Department provides $13.5 million to both the Republicans and
Democrats for their conventions, and in most cases the local
government kick in a share. In Philadelphia, the city and the state
of Pennsylvania have donated $7 million in cash and millions more
in services.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves a money gap, one that corporations have steadily
filled following a 1984 change in corporate-giving laws.
</P>
<P>
   Convention financing came under scrutiny in 1972, when columnist
Jack Anderson uncovered a memorandum written by a lobbyist, Dita
Beard, that suggested ITT Corp. had committed $400,000 to the 1972
Republican National Convention in return for having the Nixon
administration settle an antitrust case against the company.
</P>
<P>
   After Watergate Congress passed a host of fund-raising reforms,
including one that banned corporate underwriting of conventions. In
its place it instituted public financing of conventions. In 1984
the government loosened the regulations by letting convention host
committees accept unlimited corporate donations.
</P>
<P>
   The gifts were also made tax deductible, since they were
considered marketing expenses. The donors had to be disclosed, but
not until 60 days after a convention. Today, with a booming
economy, the floodgates have opened.
</P>
<P>
   One congressional beneficiary of the largesse is Representative
W.J. ``Billy'' Tauzin of Louisiana, who is vying with
Representative Michael G. Oxley of Ohio to the be next chairman of
the House Commerce Committee. Tauzin is the honoree at a Tuesday
``Mardi Gras'' party at Philadelphia's Navy Pier.
</P>
<P>
   The event is backed with $400,000 worth of donations from
utility, telecommunications and cable companies, ``Business Week''
reported. The firms are already familiar with Tauzin from his role
as chairman of a House telecommunications subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Oxley himself is hosting a corporate-sponsored party for his
fellow Commerce Committee members emceed by former ``American
Bandstand'' host Dick Clark.
</P>
<P>
   That same night, Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories Inc., Pfizer Inc.,
Eli Lilly &AMP; Co. and other drugmakers, all of whom are fighting
attempts to lower the price of prescription drugs, are holding a
reception for Republican lawmakers at the Academy of Natural
Sciences, according to the Philadephia Inquirer.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Tuesday, House Majority Whip Tom Delay of Texas is
hosting a reception for Northeast delegates, as well as a ``Red,
White and Blues'' party for an expected crowd of 5,000. The
delegate reception will be paid for with corporate donations to
DeLay's leadership political action committee, Americans for a
Republican Majority, while the street party is sponsored in part by
SBS Communications, the American Trucking Associations and
Texas-based American Airlines, Business Week reported.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic gathering is subject to similar scrutiny. Party
officials are blushing over a party that Representative Loretta
Sanchez of California is hosting Aug. 12 at the Playboy Mansion in
Los Angeles. The event is supported by Playboy Magazine and
donations to her Hispanic Unity political action committee.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Werthheimer, former head of Common Cause and now president
of Democracy 21, a public policy group that supports campaign
finance reform, thinks what will occur in Philadelphia and next
month in Los Angeles erodes the democratic process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly reinforces the notion that big givers have a
unique advantage in our democracy, and our elected officials treat
those donors as first-class citizens leaving the rest of the people
in this country as second-class citizens,'' Wertheimer said.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's street party, which he is giving along with Senator
Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania and Patricia de Stacy Harrison,
co-chairman of the Republican National Committee, is being
supported by Verizon; Global Crossing, a California fiber optics
company; the Council for Republican Environmental Advocacy, a party
environmental group; and Interface Electronics Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts delegates will eat a brunch on Monday
sponsored by Southern Energy. On Tuesday, CVS will pay the bill,
while on Wednesday it will be John Hancock and on Thursday
FleetBank. NStar and AT&AMP;T are sponsoring evening receptions.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, the delegates will join those from a
half-dozen other states at a party in the Hard Rock Cafe. The
sponsors include Pfizer and its pharmaceutical rival, Glaxo
Wellcome Inc.
</P>
<P>
   John Brockelman, executive director of the Massachusetts
Republican Party, said the donations will not exceed $6,000 per
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that at both of these conventions, corporations
want to play a role and participate in the process,'' Brockelman
said. ``This is one way for them to do it, by hosting events.''

   REPUBS-PRIMARIES (Philadelphia) _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas,
on his way here for a triumphal nomination, ended the last bit of
uncertainty surrounding next week's convention by killing efforts
to allow voters in all states to cast primary ballots that actually
counted. The plan, designed by the Republican National Committee
after this year's nominations were settled in March, was intended
to lengthen the primary system by making the big states vote last.

 c.2000 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MIAMI _ As an unshaven Isaac Rosenberg stood blindfolded, hungry
and dirty, he wondered what would become of his life in his native
Colombia.
 &HT;    The then-25-year-old was held in isolation for four months after
being kidnapped from his home in Bogota in 1988. Finally, he
``worked something out'' with his kidnappers and was released.
 &HT;    ``It was a real turning point in my life,'' he says.
 &HT;    The following year, Rosenberg sold his family's decades-old
soap-making business Elefante La Llave to Anglo-Dutch multinational
conglomerate Unilever for an undisclosed amount. Soon after,
Rosenberg headed for the United States to start a new life.
 &HT;    The 37-year-old Colombian is now building a new empire based on
fruit and vegetables. His Miami-based company, Fashion Fruit,
imports specialty produce _ from asparagus to mangos to zucchini _
from Latin America. The company operates the service year-round,
meaning New Yorkers can stir-fry fresh Guatemalan snow peas while
snowflakes are falling outside and residents of arid Arizona can
plop fresh raspberries atop their ice cream any time of the year.
He expects his sales to approach US$10 million this year.
 &HT;    Starting over wasn't easy for the silver-spooned scion. As the
heir to his family's multimillion dollar soap business, Rosenberg
had lived a privileged life up until his kidnapping _ a U.S.
education (at Northeastern University in Boston), a big house in
Bogota and all the other trappings of a wealthy Latin American. ``I
was never that motivated in school because I had my life already
planned,'' he says.
 &HT;    The plan included taking over the family business that had its
roots in Moldavia before World War II. Rosenberg's grandparents
launched the business in the 1930s, building it into a sizable
operation until the Soviets invaded the small European country and
confiscated the family's factory. Caught between communist
repression and a possible Nazi invasion, the Rosenbergs fled
Europe. To obtain the necessary exit visa, the Jewish family traded
its secret recipe for making soap.
 &HT;    The once thriving entrepreneurs boarded a boat headed for the
Panama Canal in 1939 with nothing but a suitcase crammed full of
clothes. The family landed in Panama, but the search for a suitable
place to build a factory soon took them to nearby Colombia. The
country offered a large population, strong dependence on imported
soap and a more hospitable climate than that of steamy Panama.
 &HT;    Now, decades later, third-generation Isaac Rosenberg has
repeated the past, following in his grandparents' footsteps by
leaving his homeland in search of a better life. ``I saw Colombia
changing for the worse and I did not want to raise a family in that
environment,'' he says.
 &HT;    Even after being kidnapped, the decision to leave Colombia was
not as obvious for Rosenberg as it was for his grandparents. ``It
would have been much easier for me to stay,'' he says. ``I was a
big fish in a small pond. The banks knew me and doors would always
open very fast.''
 &HT;    Rosenberg's first destination was New York City, where he began
working in 1990 as a research analyst at investment bank Westsphere
Capital, which courted wealthy South Americans eyeing investments
in U.S.-based start-up companies. While on a trip home to Colombia,
Rosenberg made friends with one of the bank's clients who had a
strawberry farm on the side. The client asked Rosenberg if he could
find some buyers in the United States. ``I found him buyers so
quickly that he decided to hire me as a partner,'' Rosenberg says.
 &HT;    As he learned more about the produce business, Rosenberg
recognized a niche market for specialty imports during the winter
months stateside. He quit his job and started his own company,
Fashion Fruit, in 1991.
 &HT;    It was hardly a cakewalk. While Rosenberg was able to fund the
business with proceeds from the sale of his family's soap-making
business, he had to arrange financing for growers in Latin America
_ which was difficult because many of them didn't have assets to
speak of. He also had to hire marketing people in Miami who could
woo longtime food distributors who already had steady suppliers.
Then there were the years of overproduction, when his profit
margins were squeezed. ``Markets go up and down and I can't predict
what's going to happen,'' he says.
 &HT;    The decision to leave Colombia is now paying off. He lives in a
well-to-do neighborhood north of Miami, has an American wife,
Deborah (whom he met at Northeastern), and loves his job. The
company has grown from one employee in 1991 to 10 employees today.
This year, he expects to bring more than 1 million boxes of fruit
and vegetables into the United States, each carrying an average
price tag of US$10 a box. He predicts the company will grow another
50 percent next year, as he works to expand his specialty produce
to the Asian and European markets. He also plans on launching a Web
site to tie into wholesalers.
 &HT;    Finding a niche was the key to success, Rosenberg says. ``My
father was involved in everything from the soap business to
restaurants to real estate to distributing powdered milk in
Colombia,'' he says. ``Here, you cannot be a jack-of-all-trades;
the market is too sophisticated for that.''
 &HT;    It also helps to have good relations with your suppliers. ``We
chose Isaac because as a Latin, he speaks our language and
understands our needs,'' says Antonio Maldonado, who has his own
snow pea-growing business in Guatemala and sells most of his
produce through Rosenberg. ``We depend on him to get our products
sold in this extremely competitive market.''
 &HT;    Rosenberg is now focused on building his business and
identifying new opportunities throughout the region. His most
recent adventure included a trip to Havana last April with the
Young Entrepreneurs' Organization to meet with government officials
and make contacts in preparation for a post-embargo Cuba.
 &HT;    With the U.S. government's softening stance on Cuba,
opportunities for food and medical imports to the Caribbean island
continue to emerge. Rosenberg acknowledges that a Cuba without
barriers would do wonders for his business. But he makes clear he
would not export products from Cuba. ``The fruit there is no good.
Cuba lacks pesticides, it lacks resources, it lacks everything,''
he says.
 &HT;    Instead, if the embargo is lifted, Rosenberg envisions shipping
fruit and vegetables to tourist spots on the island. With nine
years of experience under his belt, Rosenberg is confident he can
meet the often capricious needs of foreign tourists in Cuba.
``Europeans will only eat white asparagus and Americans won't eat
strawberries unless they're bright red,'' he says.
 &HT;    What's the biggest difference between doing business in the
United States versus Latin America? ``In the United States you make
it because of who you are, not because of what your last name is,''
he says. Given what he's managed to do in such a short time, he's
obviously adapted quickly.

 &HT;    MIAMI _ Barbudo, con los ojos vendados, hambriento y sucio,
Isaac Rosenberg se preguntaba que seria de su vida en su natal
Colombia.
 &HT;    Entonces tenia 25 anos. Secuestrado de su casa en Bogota en
1988, llevaba cuatro meses en cautiverio. Por fin llego a un
acuerdo con sus captores y lo dejaron en libertad.
 &HT;    ``Fue un momento decisivo en mi vida,'' afirma.
 &HT;    En 1989, Rosenberg vendio por una suma no revelada el negocio
familiar, Elefante La Llave, que fabricaba jabon para el
conglomerado angloholandes Unilever. La familia tenia el negocio
desde hacia varias decadas. Poco despues Rosenberg se marcho a
Estados Unidos para comenzar una nueva vida.
 &HT;    El colombiano ahora levanta un imperio de frutas y verduras. Su
compania, Fashion Fruit, de Miami, importa productos selectos _
mangos, esparragos, calabacines _ de America Latina todo el ano.
Eso significa que los neoyorquinos pueden freir guisantes de
Guatemala mientras nieva, y que los habitantes de la arida Arizona
pueden poner frambuesas frescas en sus helados en cualquier epoca
del ano. Rosenberg espera que sus ventas lleguen a US$10 millones
este ano.
 &HT;    Comenzar de nuevo no fue facil para un hombre nacido en cuna de
plata. Como heredero del negocio multimillonario de su familia,
habia tenido una existencia privilegiada hasta que lo secuestraron:
estudio en la Universidad Northeastern de Boston, vivia en una
casona de Bogota y disfrutaba de todos los lujos de un
latinoamericano adinerado. ``Nunca fui un estudiante muy motivado
porque mi vida ya estaba planeada,'' relata.
 &HT;    El negocio familiar surgio en Moldavia antes de la Segunda
Guerra Mundial. Los abuelos de Rosenberg establecieron la empresa
en los anos 30 y la convirtieron en una operacion de envergadura
hasta que los sovieticos invadieron el pequeno pais europeo y les
confiscaron la fabrica. Atrapados entre la represion comunista y
una posible invasion nazi, los Rosenberg huyeron de Europa. Para
conseguir el permiso de salida, la familia judia revelo su receta
secreta para fabricar jabon.
 &HT;    En 1939, los empresarios tomaron un barco rumbo al Canal de
Panama sin mas equipaje que una maleta llena de ropa. La familia
desembarco en Panama, pero en su busqueda de un lugar apropiado
para una fabrica no tardaron en trasladarse a la cercana Colombia.
El pais tenia mas poblacion, una fuerte dependencia en el jabon
importado y un clima mas amable que el del humedo Panama.
 &HT;    Tercera generacion, tercer pais. Hoy, decadas despues, Isaac
Rosenberg ha repetido la historia de su familia al abandonar su
patria en busca de una vida mejor. ``Vi que en Colombia las cosas
empeoraban y no queria criar a mis hijos en ese ambiente,''
comenta.
 &HT;    Incluso despues que lo secuestraron, su decision de marcharse no
era tan obvia para Rosenberg como lo fue para sus abuelos. ``Me
habria sido mucho mas facil quedarme,'' dice. ``Era como un pez
grande en una pecera pequena. Los bancos me conocian y las puertas
siempre se me abrian rapidamente.''
 &HT;    El primer destino de Rosenberg fue Nueva York, donde comenzo a
trabajar en 1990 como analista en el banco de inversion Westsphere
Capital, que atendia a sudamericanos ricos interesados en invertir
en companias nuevas de Estados Unidos. En un viaje a Colombia,
Rosenberg hizo amistad con uno de los clientes del banco que
cultivaba fresas. El cliente le pregunto a Rosenberg si podia
buscar compradores en Estados Unidos. ``Le consegui compradores tan
rapido que decidio contratarme como socio,'' dice Rosenberg.
 &HT;    Al aprender mas del negocio agricola, Rosenberg reconocio un
mercado para la importacion de productos especiales en Estados
Unidos durante el invierno. Dejo su empleo y puso su propia
compania, Fashion Fruit, en 1991.
 &HT;    No fue un paseo. Aunque Rosenberg pudo costear el negocio con
las ganancias de la venta del negocio de fabricacion de jabon de su
familia, tuvo que conseguir financiamiento para los agricultores
latinoamericanos, lo que fue dificil porque muchos no tenian bienes
para respaldar los prestamos. Tambien tuvo que contratar a
especialistas de mercadeo en Miami para atraer a los distribuidores
establecidos de alimentos que ya tenian suministradores. Luego
vinieron los anos de la superproduccion, cuando se redujeron los
margenes de ganancia. ``Los mercados suben y bajan y yo no puedo
pronosticar lo que va a pasar,'' dice.
 &HT;    La decision de irse de Colombia ya da frutos. Rosenberg vive en
un barrio prospero al norte de Miami, se caso con una
norteamericana (que conocio en la Universidad Northeastern) y adora
su trabajo. La compania ha crecido de un empleado en 1991 a 10 hoy.
Este ano espera importar mas de un millon de cajas de frutas y
verduras a Estados Unidos, con un precio promedio de US$10 la caja.
Pronostica que la compania crecera otro 50 por ciento el ano
proximo con la prevista expansion a los mercados asiaticos y
europeos. Tambien planea lanzar un website para conectarse con los
mayoristas.
 &HT;    Leche en polvo y condos. Encontrar un nicho fue la clave del
exito, dice Rosenberg. ``Mi padre trabajo en muchas cosas:
fabricacion de jabon, restaurantes, bienes raices; hasta distribuyo
leche en polvo en Colombia,'' recuerda. ``Aqui uno no puede
dedicarse a muchas cosas: el mercado es demasiado complejo.''
 &HT;    Tambien es conveniente tener buenas relaciones con los
suministradores. ``Escogimos a Isaac porque es latinoamericano,
habla nuestro idioma y entiende nuestras necesidades,'' dice
Antonio Maldonado, que tiene un negocio de guisantes en Guatemala y
vende la mayor parte de su produccion a traves de Rosenberg.
``Dependemos de el para vender nuestros productos en este mercado,
donde hay mucha competencia.''
 &HT;    Rosenberg ahora se concentra en fomentar su negocio y buscar
nuevas oportunidades en la region. Su aventura mas reciente fue un
viaje a La Habana el pasado abril con la Organizacion de
Empresarios Jovenes. En la capital de Cuba se reunieron con
funcionarios de gobierno y establecieron contactos para cuando
Estados Unidos levante el embargo.
 &HT;    Con una postura menos rigida del gobierno norteamericano hacia
Cuba, han surgido oportunidades de exportar alimentos y medicinas a
la isla. Rosenberg reconoce que una Cuba sin barreras seria una
maravilla para su negocio. Pero aclara que no exportaria productos
cubanos. ``Las frutas no son buenas. Cuba carece de plaguicidas, de
recursos, de todo,'' afirma.
 &HT;    Si el embargo se levanta, Rosenberg se ve enviando frutas y
verduras a centros turisticos en la isla. Con nueve anos de
experiencia en el negocio, Rosenberg confia en su capacidad de
complacer los caprichos de los turistas extranjeros en Cuba. ``Los
europeos no comen esparragos si no son blancos y los
norteamericanos no comen fresas a menos que sean bien rojas,''
senala.
 &HT;    Cual es la mayor diferencia entre hacer negocios en Estados
Unidos y en America Latina? ``En Estados Unidos uno triunfa por lo
que uno es, no por el apellido,'' dice. Con lo que ha hecho en tan
poco tiempo, no hay duda de que se ha adaptado rapidamente.

 &HT;    CHENEY'S `COMPASSION' AS PREDICTABLE AS BUSH'S
 &HT;    
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>

 &HT;    
 &HT;    c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Maybe Dick Cheney is a fair-weather
``compassionate conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever else George W. Bush expected to accomplish with his
choice of Cheney as running mate, he assumed the most important
announcement of his presidential race so far also would divert
attention from an embarrassing controversy over his budget
priorities in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, for about two weeks before Bush introduced Cheney, the
Texas governor had been barraged daily by Democrats over unexpected
budgetary shortages in Medicaid and a few other programs in his
home state.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush's opponents exaggerated the problem, the fact that
Bush had insisted last year on using $1.7 billion of a $6.4 billion
budgetary surplus to cut taxes was blasted as short-sighted and
used to paint the governor as more conservative than compassionate.
</P>
<P>
   (Compassionate, in this discussion, is used in the sense of
improving governmental programs that assist people in need and
boosting educational opportunities that help people learn to help
themselves. The word is not used in the sense, as some would use
it, of giving taxpayers a break.)
</P>
<P>
   Bush and state legislators also raised teachers' pay and funded
a new health insurance program for low-income children. But those
compassionate pluses were smothered in a firestorm of political
rhetoric, particularly since the tax cuts had a greater impact on
some businesses than they did on most consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Then up stepped Cheney, and he certainly diverted attention from
the Texas budget. But the initial reviews for Bush were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   The governor got positive marks for choosing a running mate _ a
former congressman, former secretary of defense and able Washington
player _ who had strengths that Bush lacked. Cheney is widely
regarded for his expertise in national and international affairs,
areas in which Bush is still being tutored.
</P>
<P>
   But while in Congress in the 1970s and 1980s, Cheney also
compiled a strongly conservative voting record that Democrats
immediately began resurrecting and attacking with glee.
</P>
<P>
   He was anti-abortion, anti-gun control and anti-big government,
viewpoints that he generally shares with Bush. But he even voted
against Head Start, which seems to contradict the high priority
that Bush has placed on education.
</P>
<P>
   And he voted against a symbolic resolution that called on South
Africa to free Nelson Mandela, the leader of the struggle to end
apartheid, from prison. What kind of message does that deliver to
the minority voters whom Bush has been trying mightily to woo into
the Republican tent?
</P>
<P>
   Democrats who already had been ridiculing Bush's claims to be a
``compassionate conservative'' and a different kind of Republican
pounced like wolves on a chunk of fresh meat.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush found himself on the defensive again, as he and his new
running mate were peppered with questions about how well a
budget-cutting congressman from the Reagan era could fit on a
``compassionate conservative'' ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney admitted that he voted ``a great many times against
sundry and worthy programs'' while he was in Congress because he
didn't think the country could afford them. His priority back then,
he explained, was to reduce the huge federal deficit that loomed
over the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he added, the economy has improved, times have changed,
and, he suggested, so have his priorities. For one, he would no
longer vote against Head Start, a program designed to boost
educational opportunities for disadvantaged children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have surpluses. And we do have the opportunity, I think,
to go out and do some things that we might have opposed 20 years
ago,'' Cheney said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, according to this theory, government can now
afford to be more ``compassionate'' because heavy budgetary storm
clouds have disappeared. Hence the conclusion that Cheney is ready
to practice fair-weather compassion.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, Bush also may be merely a fair-weather
``compassionate conservative,'' because he has been blessed with a
strong economy during his tenure as Texas governor and hasn't had
to practice the difficult belt-tightening that his three immediate
predecessors did.
</P>
<P>
   All things considered, it is not difficult to predict which word
would be the first to fall from the ``compassionate conservative''
balancing act if economic storm clouds were to reappear under a
Bush-Cheney administration.

BANK OF AMERICA ANNOUNCES JOB CUTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.C.)   By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bank of America, the United States' largest bank, announced on
Friday that it would cut between 9,000 and 10,000 jobs over the
next year, or roughly 6.7 percent of its work force, and use the
savings to improve its Internet offerings, enhance its brand and
improve services, especially for wealthy individuals and corporate
clients.
</P>
<P>
   Middle-level and senior managers are expected to be the
principal target of the cuts, along with workers whose jobs will be
erased by new technology. With these new steps, roughly 34,000 jobs
will have been eliminated at the bank since September 1998, when it
was created by the merger of NationsBank in Charlotte, N.C., and
the original Bank of America, in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Those two cities remain the primary addresses for senior
executives, but a company spokesman at the bank's headquarters in
Charlotte declined on Friday to say where the cuts would be made.
``They will really come across the franchise,'' said Robert L.
Stickler. The bank currently employs 150,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our days of growth by merger and acquisition are behind us,''
said Hugh L. McColl Jr., the bank's chairman and chief executive,
in a statement announcing the plan. ``For the most part, our merger
transition work also is behind us.'' The challenge now, he said, is
to make the bank's management structure, the product of multiple
mergers over the years, more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   The key interpreter of the new strategy to Wall Street on Friday
was Kenneth D. Lewis, the bank's president and chief operating
officer. Reducing management costs without alienating customers
will be something of a final exam for Lewis, 53, who is widely seen
as heir apparent to McColl, 65, who is expected to retire next
year.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Friday, Lewis emphasized that the job cuts do
not contradict the bank's announced determination to improve
customer satisfaction. In fact, he said, some of the savings will
be used to identify specific customer complaints and fix them.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, the bank gets a huge number of requests from
customers who want a copy of their canceled checks,'' Lewis said.
For each request, bank employees have to look the check up on
microfilm, copy it and mail it to the customer _ a process that
requires many people and still provides the customer with a
poor-quality copy that arrives days after the request.
</P>
<P>
   By investing in new imaging technology, Lewis continued, the
bank can eliminate 800 jobs and enable customers to look up
canceled checks online or even at an automated teller machine.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis acknowledged that making the strategy work ``is something
I'm in charge of,'' but he said that McColl ``was very supportive
of what we wanted to do.'' He declined to comment on McColl's
retirement plans, however.
</P>
<P>
   The cutbacks at the bank will inevitably be felt in the economy
of Charlotte, a city it has come to dominate, said C.W. Sealey,
chairman of the finance and business law department at the
University of North Carolina-Charlotte. But ``so long as they don't
slip too far,'' the impact should not be too severe, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stickler said the company has a ``competitive'' severance plan
to cushion job losses for management employees, who began to hear
rumors of the job cuts about two weeks ago. The bank expects to
incur a charge against its third-quarter earnings of as much as
$350 million, reflecting severance costs and other expenses
involved in the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts and institutional investors seemed to take
the news in stride. On a down day in the market, bank stocks were
particularly weak Friday, reflecting investor concern that bank
profits would be hurt if a strong economy prompted the Federal
Reserve Board to increase interest rates again.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, Bank of America's shares were stronger than most.
Its shares closed at $46.50, down 25 cents. That is nevertheless
substantially below its high of $76.375, which it reached last
July.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The bank's top executives have reassured analysts that they
still expect to meet their revenue and profit forecasts, said Ron
Mandle, a senior research analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. The bank
expects revenues to grow between 7 percent and 9 percent per year,
with earnings per share increasing between 12 percent and 15
percent per year.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mandle, that would allow the bank to meet Wall
Street's profit expectations for the current year, about $5.21 a
share, and perhaps exceed them next year, when earnings are now
expected to be $5.76 a share. ``They're really just changing the
mix, not making absolute cuts,'' the analyst added.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the bank's new ``to-do'' list is to steer an
additional $70 million into ``e-commerce initiatives'' in the next
six months and speed up the introduction of Internet technology at
its bank offices and call centers. The bank, which serves 30
million households and 2 million businesses, currently has about
14,500 branches in 21 states and the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The bank expects to reduce the number of branches by about 200
by the end of the year, Stickler said, but that entails closing 350
offices and opening 150 new branches in more promising locations.
</P>
<P>
   Another element of the new strategy involves investing more in
investment-banking operations at home, in Europe and in Asia, to
serve business customers in 190 countries abroad. Through a prior
merger, the new bank inherited the Midwestern corporate business of
the old Continental Illinois Bank in Chicago, Mandle noted, and it
continues to serve the corporate customers of Bank of America and
NationsBank.
</P>
<P>
   McColl and Lewis also plan to promote the bank's brand more
aggressively, through increased advertising, and cater more
energetically to high-income individuals by improving their
asset-management services and opening 10 new private banking
offices in wealthy regions, especially on the West Coast.

verduras a Estados Unidos, con un precio promedio de US$10 la caja.
Pronostica que la compania crecera otro 50 por ciento el ano
proximo con la prevista expansion a los mercados asiaticos y
europeos. Tambien planea lanzar un website para conectarse con los
mayoristas.
 &HT;    Leche en polvo y condos. Encontrar un nicho fue la clave del
exito, dice Rosenberg. ``Mi padre trabajo en muchas cosas:
fabricacion de jabon, restaurantes, bienes raices; hasta distribuyo
leche en polvo en Colombia,'' recuerda. ``Aqui uno no puede
dedicarse a muchas cosas: el mercado es demasiado complejo.''
 &HT;    Tambien es conveniente tener buenas relaciones con los
suministradores. ``Escogimos a Isaac porque es latinoamericano,
habla nuestro idioma y entiende nuestras necesidades,'' dice
Antonio Maldonado, que tiene un negocio de guisantes en Guatemala y
vende la mayor parte de su produccion a traves de Rosenberg.
``Dependemos de el para vender nuestros productos en este mercado,
donde hay mucha competencia.''
 &HT;    Rosenberg ahora se concentra en fomentar su negocio y buscar
nuevas oportunidades en la region. Su aventura mas reciente fue un
viaje a La Habana el pasado abril con la Organizacion de
Empresarios Jovenes. En la capital de Cuba se reunieron con
funcionarios de gobierno y establecieron contactos para cuando
Estados Unidos levante el embargo.
 &HT;    Con una postura menos rigida del gobierno norteamericano hacia
Cuba, han surgido oportunidades de exportar alimentos y medicinas a
la isla. Rosenberg reconoce que una Cuba sin barreras seria una
maravilla para su negocio. Pero aclara que no exportaria productos
cubanos. ``Las frutas no son buenas. Cuba carece de plaguicidas, de
recursos, de todo,'' afirma.
 &HT;    Si el embargo se levanta, Rosenberg se ve enviando frutas y
verduras a centros turisticos en la isla. Con nueve anos de
experiencia en el negocio, Rosenberg confia en su capacidad de
complacer los caprichos de los turistas extranjeros en Cuba. ``Los
europeos no comen esparragos si no son blancos y los
norteamericanos no comen fresas a menos que sean bien rojas,''
senala.
 &HT;    Cual es la mayor diferencia entre hacer negocios en Estados
Unidos y en America Latina? ``En Estados Unidos uno triunfa por lo
que uno es, no por el apellido,'' dice. Con lo que ha hecho en tan
poco tiempo, no hay duda de que se ha adaptado rapidamente.

EVOLUTION BECOMES NEW LITMUS TEST IN KANSAS POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is just a Kansas school board election, a primary election at
that. But no one in Kansas or anywhere else is taking this race for
granted.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of dollars has been raised, some of it from
out of state. (Previous school board candidates usually raised only
a few hundred dollars.) Candidates are taking the unusual step of
running television ads and are printing up leaflets and yard signs
by the thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are switching their party affiliation to Republican
just to vote for school board candidates in the Republican primary.
And in what political observers consider extraordinary, Kansas'
highest-ranking Republicans _ the governor and a U.S. senator _
have not only weighed in on the race, but have endorsed opposing
candidates in their own party.
</P>
<P>
   ``When was the last time you were even aware who was running for
your state board of education?'' asked Michael Davis, a law
professor at the University of Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   The frenzy is the upshot of a controversial vote last August by
the Kansas Board of Education, which removed evolution as an
explanation for the origin of species and the universe from the
state's science curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, a 6-4 vote with conservative Republicans in the
majority, reverberated around the country, where other states have
faced recent battles between evolution and creationism. Kansas did
not ban the teaching of evolution, leaving that option up to local
school districts. But its decision meant that evolution will not be
included in the state assessment tests that evaluate student
performance, which may discourage teachers from devoting time to
the subject. The board also removed from the curriculum the big
bang theory of the origin of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Now, five of 10 Board of Education seats are up for election,
and in four of the five there is a primary faceoff on Aug. 1, with
conservative Republicans who favor the new science standards being
challenged by moderate Republicans who oppose them. In heavily
Republican Kansas, the primary winners will be strongly favored to
win in November.
</P>
<P>
   The election is being watched around the nation since, more than
a decade after the Supreme Court said states could not compel the
teaching of creationism, evolution opponents have begun pressing
state and local school boards to play down the importance of
evolution by presenting it, alongside creationism and other
theories, as just one unproven explanation.
</P>
<P>
   In October, two months after the Kansas decision, state
officials in Kentucky eliminated the word ``evolution'' but not the
scientific theory from school curriculum, substituting the phrase
``change over time.'' In Oklahoma, officials recently ordered that
textbooks carry a disclaimer about the certainty of evolution,
similar to a step already taken by Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Evolution's defenders have been active too, winning a victory
last fall when New Mexico banned creationism and endorsed evolution
in the science curriculum. Texas, Ohio, Washington, New Hampshire,
Tennessee and other states have considered, but defeated, proposals
by evolution critics, including some that would have required
teachers to also present evidence contradicting it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It strikes me that evolution is even more of a litmus test
than abortion now _ courtesy of the Kansas Board of Education,''
said Burdett Loomis, a University of Kansas political scientist.
``It is really the defining characteristic of Kansas politics
now.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The issue is even figuring in a hotly contested congressional
race for the district that borders Kansas City. The moderate
Republican candidate, Greg Musil, has run television ads mentioning
the evolution vote and saying, ``I'm embarrassed that Kansas is now
being called a backward state.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Gary Sherrer, who is also the state's commerce
secretary, said the school board's decision had scared off
companies considering moving to Kansas. They were concerned, he
said, that Kansas was no longer a place ``where not only will their
employees' kids get a good education, but also where the work force
of the future is good.''
</P>
<P>
   In the school board races, Gov. Bill Graves, who initially
called the board's decision ``terrible'' and ``tragic,'' has
endorsed moderate Republicans. Sen. Sam Brownback has endorsed
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Groups like People for the American Way sponsored a re-enactment
of the Scopes ``monkey trial'' at the University of Kansas this
month, starring Ed Asner, a native Kansan. Proponents of
non-evolutionary theories, like Phillip Johnson, a University of
California law professor who believes the universe is so complex
that an ``intelligent designer'' must have been responsible, have
donated money to conservative candidates. Local groups have formed
to defend or attack the board's vote, including a political action
committee helping conservative candidates raise money.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats have switched to the Republican Party just for
Tuesday's primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this election is so critical to Kansas children that I
was compelled to suck it up and change parties,'' said Lois Culver,
69, of Overland Park, a suburb of Kansas City. Culver, who sees the
new standards as an attempt to ``put religion in the schools,''
plans to vote for Sue Gamble, a moderate Republican who opposes the
board's vote, and then change her party registration back to
Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   Gamble, a member of the Shawnee Mission school board, said the
new standards could ``put students at a disadvantage on a national
level. You need to know about dinosaurs, the age of the earth.''
She worries that ``students from out of state won't want to come
here and study because they feel the standards won't be up to
snuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Her opponent, Linda Holloway, a conservative who was chairwoman
of the school board when the evolution decision was made, has
raised $90,000, an extraordinary sum in school board races. Gamble
has raised $36,000.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway, a former teacher, said she supported the new science
standards because she believes evolution has been made to seem too
important to science.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we should teach evolution in the schools, but I also
believe that if local districts want to teach that or other
theories that should be up to them,'' she said. ``Gosh, there could
have been a lot bigger things that we could have done. This was
pretty mild.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In Wichita, the conservative incumbent, Mary Douglass Brown,
said that the new standards ``put a little crack in the
foundation'' of evolution scientists, ``their money, their books,
their schools. There's a lot of money in evolution. To me, it's
pseudoscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, a former teacher, noted that the board left in references
to ``micro-evolution,'' changes within organisms that ``people can
see,'' such as bacteria becoming disease-resistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that humans descended from apes, no,'' she
said. ``How come there's still apes running around loose and there
are humans? Why did some of them decide to evolve and some did not?
Did they choose to stay as a monkey or what?''
</P>
<P>
   Ideas like that spurred Carol Rupe, a former Wichita school
board member, to run against her.
</P>
<P>
   Rupe said she was ``embarrassed when suddenly after the vote
last summer we were called by our friends and relatives in other
states wondering what kind of state we lived in,'' she said. ``We
said it was just a few people. But my goodness, if those few are
re-elected then it reflects on the entire state.''

ANTI-ABORTION FORCES WIN BATTLE OVER ABORTION PLANK

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Republicans fought passionately Friday over
abortion, with the anti-abortion forces easily prevailing, as the
platform committee made its way through a document intended to
balance the party's core conservatism with Gov. George W. Bush's
attempt at a more centrist appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion rights supporters tried to remove the platform's
abortion plank, which calls for a total ban on the procedure, and
tried to insert a provision declaring that the party recognized
differing views on the issue. Both amendments were overwhelmingly
defeated in subcommittee votes, and later by the full committee, in
a debate that highlighted the party's continuing fault lines.
</P>
<P>
   After an abortion rights supporter read a letter from 11 members
of the House and Senate, asking for change in the platform,
Meribelle Bolton of New Mexico declared: ``You have to understand
that many of us are under a higher authority than the Congress of
the United States, the Supreme Court or any state. I am under the
authority of the creator of the universe, and he is pro-life _
always has been, always will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Toni Casey of California, who offered the amendment to remove
the abortion plank, argued, ``We need a platform that recognizes
and understands that abortion is a sensitive, it is a delicate, and
it is a personal, moral issue between a woman and her own religion,
when she is faced with that very, very difficult and complex
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's vote was not surprising; Bush and Republican leaders
had indicated early on that they wanted no changes in the abortion
plank, which calls for a ban on abortion without exception, and the
appointment of judges who respect ``the sanctity of innocent human
life.'' They were keenly aware that four years ago, the party's
nominee, former Sen. Bob Dole, sought to add a ``tolerance''
clause, only to suffer an embarrassing defeat at the hands of the
anti-abortion forces.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, abortion rights supporters said they were disappointed
but not completely defeated, still holding out the hope that they
can get the support of a majority of six state delegations, the
first step toward bringing the issue to the floor of the full
convention, or perhaps getting a minority report reflecting their
views out of the committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working on it,'' said Susan Cullman, head of the
Republican Pro-Choice Coalition. Ann Stone, head of Republicans for
Choice, asserted, ``This is round one. We have many more to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives pushed back on other issues, including gay rights.
They reinserted language, dropped in an initial draft, that
declares, ``We do not believe sexual preference should be given
special legal protection or standing in law.'' In debating the
measure, several delegates argued that it was important to take a
stand for the traditional family at a time when there was a
movement to recognize civil unions among gays.
</P>
<P>
   The day's deliberations reflected a party acutely aware of
Bush's political needs, and his efforts to appeal to swing voters
on issues like education, but also unwilling, at times, to
compromise on core beliefs. Some of the biggest fights, for
example, came on the platform's section on education, with
conservatives resisting a strong federal role on what they argued
should be a matter for state and local communities and families.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 platform, for example, called for the abolition of the
Department of Education; the draft developed by party leaders and
the Bush forces did not. But conservatives amended that draft in
subcommittee Friday to say that the role of the federal government
in education ``must be progressively limited,'' and were clearly
resistant to much of the detailed education agenda put forward by
Bush. ``It's a sharp shift,'' said Sen. Bill Frist of Tennessee, a
co-chairman of the platform committee, referring to Bush's emphasis
on education as a national issue.
</P>
<P>
   The platform committee, pushed hard by its chairman, Gov. Tommy
Thompson of Wisconsin, was reading and voting on the platform into
the night, and expected to finish its work on Saturday. The full
convention will act on the platform on Monday. The committee is
working so fast that part of the ``tolerance'' provision on
abortion was passed Friday night, until several delegates said they
were confused about what they were voting on and asked to
reconsider their vote. It then was defeated. Stone of Republicans
for Choice said, ``Just think, we were welcome for ten or fifteen
minutes; that's real progress.''

 &HT;    CONVENTIONAL WISDOM: ONLY BUSH MATTERS
 &HT;

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge says he didn't want
it.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman says she didn't expect it.
</P>
<P>
   Former-lots-of-things Dick Cheney says he had to be persuaded to
take it.
</P>
<P>
   So go the still unfolding reports on the ultimate choice of
Texas Gov. George W. Bush for Cheney to be the Republican candidate
for vice president.
</P>
<P>
   What does the Cheney selection say about Bush, who will accept
the GOP nomination for president here this week?
</P>
<P>
   Was he bold? Was he boringly cautious? Was he brave? Or was he
politically chicken?
</P>
<P>
   In reality, there probably is an element of truth in all the
contentions and assumptions being &QL; 
bandied about here.
</P>
<P>
   Also, in reality, so what?
</P>
<P>
   Ridge and Whitman, to varying degrees, favor abortion rights.
So, of course, despite his stout denials, does Bush.
</P>
<P>
   His is just a much softer favoring, one the super-strong
anti-abortionists are willing to accept even though it is totally
illogical. Bush says he firmly opposes taking the life of a child _
in his view, a fetus, no matter how undeveloped it may be. On the
other hand, he willingly accepts exceptions in the cases of rape,
incest or for the life of the mother.
</P>
<P>
   Even more illogical is the enormous importance pro-choice
supporters and anti-abortionists alike placed on the views of
Bush's selection of a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   In the big scheme of things, what difference does it make what a
vice president thinks about much of anything?
</P>
<P>
   If any accept the notion a candidate can only express his true
views by his choice of a running mate who has open political and
philosophical conflicts with him, then surely they're as screwed up
as the duplicitous candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably in selecting former Secretary of Defense Cheney,
whose one-time record as a Republican congressman from Wyoming
demonstrates his no-exception opposition to abortion, Bush has
avoided any public dissent from the dominant anti-abortion side at
this GOP nomination convention.
</P>
<P>
   And, certainly the views offered by Whitman and Ridge to
newspapers in their individual states prove each is committed to
trying to help Bush achieve his goal of being nominated at an
upbeat convention without controversy.
</P>
<P>
   As Whitman told a New Jersey newspaper, she not only is
convinced her pro-choice position had no effect on Bush's choice,
but she intends to try to keep abortion from becoming an open point
of dissension at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have a fight over something that, at the end of the day,
doesn't determine policy may be soul-satisfying, but I don't think
gets us to the point that we want to get to, which is to win the
election in November,'' Whitman was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   There is a tone of considerable skepticism in a Philadelphia
Inquirer story about Ridge's revelation he told Bush on July 5 not
to consider him because he did not want to be apart from his
teen-age children. He said he did not reveal this publicly because
Bush asked him not to as the Texan wanted to ``preserve his
options.''
</P>
<P>
   In recalling Ridge's words in a later interview, the reporter
called the response ``vintage Ridge, an artful dodge sprinkled with
humility and a slice of what seems like candor. ... Ridge was
playing a political game.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats quoted in the story leaped to blast the Bush campaign
for keeping Ridge's decision a secret, calling it a con designed to
keep ``moderates'' hanging in hope _ ``a cynical shell game.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Whitman, Ridge stressed his first loyalty is to Bush. And
not totally unlike the more subtle Whitman, he said he believes his
chances of being chosen, had he not withdrawn himself from
consideration, were ``pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Though there is a sprinkling of abortion-rights supporters who
still hope to organize a move to change _ even remove _ the
intensely strong anti-abortion language from the GOP platform,
Whitman and Ridge have made it clear they oppose such a move.
</P>
<P>
   And, though there are GOPers of more moderate persuasions and
pundits of various ilks who have taken Bush to task for tapping the
clearly conservative Cheney as his running mate, Whitman and Ridge
have made it clear they do not concur.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, it is abundantly clear this convention is
virtually certain to achieve that for which it has been carefully
designed. That is, for it to end in accord and ardent dedication _
dedication to returning a Republican to the presidency. &QL;

PUTIN TELLS BUSINESS LEADERS HE RUNS THE COUNTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   By SABRINA TAVERNISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Vladimir Putin met on Friday with more than
20 of Russia's top business leaders to impress on them that he,
ultimately, is the one who runs the country.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the session at the Kremlin, some of the business
leaders said they were prepared to forgo special treatment and
abide by government rules if the Kremlin would create a fairer
business climate.
</P>
<P>
   In return, they said that they had won Putin's assurance that
they could hold onto their wealth and that their post-Soviet
purchases of state property would not be overturned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We received confirmation that the results of privatization
won't be reviewed and that the development of Russian business is
one of the state's top priorities,'' said Mikhail Khodorkovky, the
head of the Yukos oil company.
</P>
<P>
   Since his election in March, Putin has sought to strengthen the
Kremlin's authority by downgrading the power of regional governors
and the influence of business over government policy.
</P>
<P>
   This contrasts with the approach of his predecessor, Boris
Yeltsin, who maintained close relationships with powerful business
leaders, allowing them to roam the halls of power and hold
government positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeltsin's system relied on a spider web, and he was in the
center, said Lilya Shevtsova, a senior associate at the Carnegie
Foundation. ``Putin demolished this. He wants to be alone on the
top of the hill.''
</P>
<P>
   In a nation in where the rule of law is more a slogan than
practice and where there is no shame over egregious conflicts of
interest, it remained to be seen whether today's meeting signaled a
real turning point in rooting out corruption and favoritism.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear, for example, whether Putin is really prepared
to challenge vested interests and clean up government or whether
his main intent is to make the business leaders subservient to
himself and punish those who had failed to support him.
</P>
<P>
   The business leaders who were summoned to the Kremlin on Friday
included the heads of Gazprom, the natural gas monopoly, and
several major Russian oil companies and an array of bankers and
business executives. But in a disquieting sign that politics still
weighed heavily in the Kremlin's calculations, there were
conspicuous absences.
</P>
<P>
   Among those not invited to the meeting was Vladimir Gusinsky,
the media tycoon who was briefly jailed only to see the charges
against him dropped. Also absent was Boris Berevosky, the media and
oil magnate, who resigned from the parliament last week, charging
that Putin was involved in a ``destructive'' campaign against
business.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, for example, has gone out of his way to pressure
Gusinsky, whose television network has been critical of the
Russia's military campaign in Chechnya and was relatively
independent during the presidential election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Putin opened the session with a mild lecture, those present
said. The tone was decidedly different than that used during the
Yeltsin administration, when Yeltsin would gently chide the
business leaders, play them off against one another and than seek
their backing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to draw your attention to the fact that you built this
state yourself, to a great degree through the political or
semi-political structures under your control,'' Putin was quoted as
telling the tycoons. ``So there is no point in blaming the
reflection in the mirror. So let us get down to the point and be
open and what is necessary to do to make our relationship in this
field civilized and transparent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Putin government this week began investigating why oil
companies are paying different tax rates, and at Friday night's
meeting for the first time Putin called the Sibneft Oil Co. to task
for not paying enough taxes. Until now, Putin has not taken any
action against Roman Abramovich, a friend of Yeltsin's family and a
major Sibneft shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   While ruling out a reversal of privatization, the president
pointedly refused to offer amnesty to the business leaders for
their excesses in amassing wealth in the chaos and legal vacuum
that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the business leaders appeared to be on the defensive,
and took a conciliatory stance. Vladmir Potanin, the chairman of
the board of Interros, which controls Norilsk Nickel, one of the
world's largest mining and metallurgical concerns, has been
particularly eager to seek an accommodation with Putin, especially
after the Moscow prosecutor raised questions about the terms of the
Norilsk Nickel privatization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business finally understands that using loopholes in the law
is not correct,'' Potanin said.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, said the government still had a lot to do if it
was serious about fighting crony capitalism. For example, it has to
cut tax rates to encourage compliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the tax rates are lowered every businessman is a
criminal,'' said Kakha Bendukidze, the new head of Uralmash, a
heavy equipment manufacturer whose previous president was slain in
a contract killing earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   While Putin has the upper hand some key issues remain
unresolved, and the two sides agreed to meet again.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Nemtsov, the former deputy prime minister and
self-proclaimed economic reformer who helped organize Friday s
session, insisted that the meeting marked a new period. Russia's
businessmen are prepared to be more responsible, he said, so long
as their newly acquired wealth will be respected by state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The oligarchs are fed up with being oligarchs, Nemtsov said.
``They just want to be businessmen and pay their taxes.''

   PHILADELPHIA _ During the Republican National Convention at
Miami Beach in 1972, some overeager young things handed out copies
of the minute-by-minute schedule that the White House had ordained
for Richard Nixon's second coronation. Even the ``spontaneous''
floor demonstrations were slotted in precisely.
</P>
<P>
   Aghast that its intricate stage management had been revealed,
Nixon's high command ordered the scripts recalled, and tearful
go-fers skittered among journalists begging for the telltale
document to be handed back.
</P>
<P>
   Fat chance. Here was the evidence that the proceedings were as
packaged and plastic as they appeared. The only moment of
spontaneity for the Republicans 28 years ago came outside the
formal confines of the convention, when an exuberant Sammy Davis
Jr. hugged a (how shall I put this) surprised Nixon at a rally
beside Biscayne Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Our innocence and naivete were showing. Why wouldn't a candidate
who had the nomination firmly in hand want to be in absolute
control of what was then hours of virtually gavel-to-gavel network
television coverage?
</P>
<P>
   In truth, shame on politicians who don't use every reasonable
advantage afforded them, and shame on journalists who don't point
out what the politicians are up to. Remember all this as you watch
the quadrennial Republican and Democratic whiz-bangs unfold over
the next three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Unless things go terribly awry, the Bush and Gore operations
will make Nixon '72 look like parvenus when it comes to convention
orchestration. In three decades political illusion has gone from
being a (poorly) guarded secret to a point of pride for presumptive
nominees. (Note to taxpayers: Enjoy the show, you're paying for the
extravaganzas. The two major parties got $13.5 million each this
year in federal funds from taxpayer check-offs to help stage their
conventions, and even the Reform Party bellied up to the trough for
$2.5 million.)
</P>
<P>
   At times in the campaign, Vice President Al Gore and especially
George W. Bush have shown they can be very focused. Expect their
convention managers to be no less sharply honed in presenting a
tightly scripted message.
</P>
<P>
   There may not be any smoke and mirrors on the elaborate sets,
but there might as well be, both here and in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans will be on the thinnest ice when they attempt to
make you believe they are a diverse lot. Do not take prime-time
appearances by retired Gen. Colin Powell and former National
Security Council official Condoleezza Rice, two very distinguished
black Americans, as evidence that the white-people's party has
suddenly begun to march again to Lincoln's drum. It may sincerely
want to, and Powell and Rice may be fine symbols of the desire, but
it hasn't happened yet. Ditto for the GOP pitch to Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   The fraud-o-meter will buzz most loudly for the Democrats two
weeks hence when you start to hear phrases such as ``working
families'' and ``targeted tax cuts.'' That's the tired, old
class-warfare pitch. Applauding the loudest will be some
overstuffed union boss with a $40 stogey clenched between his teeth
(unlit, given the California no-smoking rules).
</P>
<P>
   Not to seem too perverse, but with any luck the attempts at
total management will run into trouble, and the national party
meetings will not go as smoothly as planned. While the winning
campaigns have the right to decide who will speak when and make the
program most compelling to targeted voters during the network's
limited prime-time coverage, there remain a few elements beyond
their control.
</P>
<P>
   For Republicans, the most ticklish point over the last few
conventions has been abortion. The Bush folks have nailed that down
this time around. And the off chance of a small but interesting
floor fight fizzled Friday with the death of the bizarre proposal
to mandate that the smallest-population states hold their
presidential primaries first.
</P>
<P>
   For Democrats, the clearest threat to the script will be outside
the convention hall _ protesters like those who created havoc at
the World Trade Organization in Seattle and were merely an
unsightly annoyance at the World Bank sessions in Washington.
Organized labor has promised to attempt to keep the lid on, but,
hey, it's the streets, it's Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party show in Long Beach, Calif., the weekend ahead
of the Democrats may be more interesting. Check it out on C-SPAN as
the nets may not deign to cover unless there's blood on the floor
(which given the presence of Pat Buchanan and some of his
bully-boys is not an impossibility).
</P>
<P>
   As for the Republican tea party starting Monday, where is Sammy
Davis Jr. when you need him?

FUJIMOR I INAUGURATED TO THIRD TERM AMID PROTESTS 
</HEADLINE>
 I -NYT   By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ President Alberto Fujimori was inaugurated on
Friday to a third term, as police and demonstrators engaged in
running battles that engulfed the downtown area in tear gas and
smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's day began with military marches and a special Mass.
But waves of demonstrators, angered in their belief that he had
been elected in a fraudulent vote, tried to interrupt the
proceedings, only to be turned back by police who used water cannon
and tear gas and fired bullets into the air.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations were far smaller than organizers had hoped.
Still, the protesters threw rocks and sticks at police, set
bonfires at the gates of the presidential palace and vandalized
several government offices. Two people were reported to have died
in fires set Friday, and about 100 people were injured and scores
of protesters were dragged away in handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   As Fujimori took the oath of office, opposition congressmen,
some wearing gas masks in a rebuke to the president and carrying
placards demanding new elections, jeered and walked out of the
congressional chamber. But Fujimori made scant reference in his
40-minute address to the turbulence that followed two rounds of
balloting during which, international observer teams and opposition
leaders have charged, there were vote irregularities and dirty
campaign tricks perpetrated by his intelligence agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of our people are not in agreement with our program,''
Fujimori, 62, acknowledged. ``That's democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   But he stopped short of asking for a reconciliation in a nation
that has become increasingly polarized in the two years since
Congress dismissed three judges who ruled that Fujimori was
disobeying the constitution by seeking a third five-year term.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech short on rhetorical flare and delivered in a
businesslike fashion, he reminded Peruvians of his past successes
at halting years of hyperinflation and in making peace with
Ecuador. He also promised to ``fortify democracy and generate
employment and well-being with discipline, prudence and realism.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori, who is the son of Japanese immigrants, outlined
promises that he would work to improve the judicial system and
reorganize the security services now that two terrorist groups have
been virtually defeated. But he did not address complaints by the
Clinton administration, the Organization of American States and
several Latin American and European governments that he had
governed Peru the last several years in an increasingly
authoritarian manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's remember that in no country in the world does the
minority govern, and certainly not in Peru,'' he said defiantly.
</P>
<P>
   Even as civilian democracy has progressed in Latin American
countries like Mexico, Argentina and Chile, Fujimori has become the
symbol of a countertrend that disturbs many officials in Washington
and around the region. An elected president was overthrown this
year in a coup in Ecuador, and President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela
has appeared to take lessons from Fujimori as he led a populist
crusade.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton administration has been reluctant to take tough
action against Fujimori because of his commitment to root out drug
trafficking and for fear that the leadership of the opposition is
too erratic to govern.
</P>
<P>
   Alejandro Toledo, the opposition presidential candidate who
dropped out of the race a week before the May 28 runoff, originally
said the demonstrators would block the inauguration altogether. But
with his support flagging, Toledo lowered expectations and called
for a strategy to force democratic change in the longer run.
</P>
<P>
   ``This march will not end until the dictatorship falls,'' Toledo
told a rally of 40,000 protestors in downtown Lima Thursday night.
``Fujimori must understand that the people will not stop
demonstrating until there are new elections.''
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators, mostly students and young workers, traveled
to Lima from around the country by bus, train and even boat along
Amazonian tributaries.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Friday, Fujimori tried to bolster his base of
rural Indians and residents of Lima's shantytowns with repeated
promises that he would make creating jobs his first priority. To
promote development in the Andean highlands, he promised to
stimulate projects to improve irrigation and wool production.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would build 3,000 schools, pave roads in urban
shantytowns and expand supplies of clean water and electricity. He
also vowed to expand a public school breakfast program to include
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The highlands must be transformed into something where more
than despair grows,'' he said in what was probably the most
eloquent line of his speech.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori also tried to reassure investors, who in recent weeks
have grown alarmed by his increasingly populist rhetoric. He
promised to curb an expanding government deficit and to keep the
annual inflation rate under 4 percent.

MONTANA THE STAR AT LATEST HALL OF FAME INDUCTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANTON, Ohio _ Hundreds of fans stood outside the Pro Football
Hall of Fame, many of them holding ``Joe Montana Footballs'' as
they waited patiently in hope of an autograph from Saturday's
top-billed inductee.
</P>
<P>
   Considered perhaps the greatest quarterback of all-time,
Montana's acceptance speech is expected to be emotional and
heartfelt.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know until you get up there, but I expect it'll be
tough,'' said Montana. ``It's more difficult to say the things you
want to say in front of our friends and family because, while it'll
be fun, I'll be glad when it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Montana has chosen former 49ers owner Edward DeBartolo Jr. as
his presenter, and team officials including Bill Walsh will be in
attendance. Montana's teammate, safety Ronnie Lott, will also be
enshrined, along with former 49er linebacker Dave Wilcox, former
Raider and Charlestown native Howie Long, and Pittsburgh Steelers
owner Dan Rooney.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, Joe Montana and Ronnie Lott were the best to
every play at their position,'' said Walsh, architect of the ``West
Coast'' system so instrumental in Montana's success. Montana set
the tone for the offense while Lott's reckless abandon and
leadership set the tone on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh is one of the 137 living Hall of Famers, 111 of whom are
here this week for one of the greatest sports reunions ever. The
feeling is very much like the gathering of Hall of Famers at Fenway
Park for last July's All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredible,'' said David Motts, an executive with the
Hall of Fame. ``You turn around and there's yet another fanous
player. It's chilling to see all of these great players.''
</P>
<P>
   Patriots owner Bob Kraft was scheduled to be here, accompanying
Patriots Hall of Famer John Hannah. Also representing the Patriots
is cornerback Mike Haynes, who played half of his career in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, who was an All-American from USC, was formerly a
cornerback who eventually found his niche and revolutionized the
safety position. Lott helped lead the 49ers to a 1981 Super Bowl
(XVI) championship and he became the second NFL rookie to return
three interceptions for touchdowns. He went to 10 Pro Bowls in his
14-year career that also included brief stints with the LA Raiders
and New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Montana, who went to eight Pro Bowls, won four Super Bowl rings
(and MVP honors in three) and orchestrated 31 fourth-quarter
comebacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always knew I had the ability,'' said Montana, who donned
the famous yellow jacket at Friday morning's Mayor's Breakfast.
``For me it was a case of knowing I had to be ready for the day
when I did get the opportunity. I wanted to make sure that once
that moment came I'd be ready to grab it.''
</P>
<P>
   Long was a second-round pick in the 1981 draft of the Raiders,
made it to eight Pro Bowls and won one championship with the
Raiders in 1983-84. In his 13-year career, he sacked the
quarterback 84 times.
</P>
<P>
   Wilcox is perhaps the least heralded of the five, but he had a
stellar 11-year career with the 49ers (1964-74). Wilcox was an
outside linebacker, nicknamed ``the Intimidator'' by the many tight
ends who were shut down. Wilcox, 6 feet 3 inches, 240 pounds,
played at Boise Junior College and the University of Oregon. He was
considered a true student of the game and wanted the play to come
his way. ``What I do best is not let people block me,'' Wilcox
often said. ``I just hate to be blocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Rooney, president of the Steelers since 1975 but in his 45th
year with the organization founded by his father, Art, is credited
with helping to modernize the NFL with a management style that
enabled franchises to thrive. Since 1972, the Steelers have won the
AFC Central Division 14 times, the AFC five times, and have won
four Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Friday, three members of the media were honored at the
breakfast. Longtime NFL broadcaster Ray Scott was awarded the Pro
Football Hall of Fame's Pete Rozelle Radio-Television Award; Tampa
Bay Tribune writer Tom McEwen was the recipient of the Dick McCann
Memorial Award given for distinguished service in the field of pro
football reporting by the Pro Football Writers of America. Also
honored was John Biever of Sports Illustrated for his photograph
entitled ``Way Over the Top'' which was judged as Pro Football
Photograph of the Year in the annual Hall of Fame contest.

QUARTERLY REPORT SHOWS STRONG ECONOMIC GROWTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MARKET-NYT, with graphic) 
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite a pullback in consumer spending, the U.S. economy grew
at a surprisingly robust 5.2 percent annual rate in the second
quarter, the Commerce Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A widely expected slowdown failed to materialize. The economy
actually grew faster in the second quarter than in the first. But
for all its strength, the second quarter offered just enough signs
of weakness to raise doubts about the future of the longest
economic expansion in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   Business investment, particularly in computers and software,
sustained the growth, and so did corporate willingness to churn out
consumer merchandise, although consumer sales weakened. Goods
piling up unsold in warehouses and stores accounted for nearly a
percentage point of the 5.2 percent growth.
</P>
<P>
   A surge in federal government spending, mainly for defense and
for the now largely completed 2000 census, added nearly another
percentage point to the growth of the gross domestic product, which
is the value of all new goods and services. But the economy's
future path is in the hands of consumers, whose spending accounts
for most of the now $9 trillion economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question is what happens next to consumer demand;
will it rebound,'' said Richard D. Rippe, chief economist at
Prudential Securities. ``My guess is that it will.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street seemed to agree that economic growth in the second
half of the year would remain well above the 4 percent level. That
is the maximum growth rate that the economy can sustain, in the
Federal Reserve Board's view, before shortages of goods and
services appear and prices rise.
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices fell in expectation that the Fed would raise
interest rates again to slow the economy, if not at its next
policy-making meeting on Aug. 22, then later on. Higher rates
encourage investors to shift their money from stocks into
interest-bearing securities.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department also issued a revision Friday of
economic growth rates going back to the fourth quarter of 1996. The
average quarterly growth rate since then was nudged up to 4.6
percent from 4.5 percent. The revisions helped President Clinton to
declare that economic growth since he took office in 1993 averaged
4 percent a year, ``the best growth America has had since the
Kennedy-Johnson years.''
</P>
<P>
   There were big revisions for last year's fourth quarter and this
year's first quarter, mostly because of inventory swings.
Stockpiles swelled in the fourth, particularly stockpiles of farm
produce, and as a result the growth rate was revised to 8.3 percent
from 7.3 percent. In the first quarter, however, inventories were
drawn down, and growth was reduced to a 4.8 percent annual rate,
instead of the originally reported 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   An upward revision in business investment also played a role in
swelling economic growth in the fourth quarter. In the first
quarter, however, investment in new equipment and software turned
out to be weaker than was originally reported, partly because of a
strike at Boeing Co., which reduced aircraft production.
</P>
<P>
   Business held up its end handsomely in the second quarter. There
was robust spending for equipment, software, office buildings,
warehouses and other commercial buildings. The federal government
also made a strong contribution, raising its spending by nearly 18
percent in the second quarter, after a fall of 14 percent in the
first.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that swing reflected quirks in government accounting,
but the Commerce Department reported a significant increase in
defense spending, not for new weaponry but for various support
functions, including research, weapons repair and personnel
services.
</P>
<P>
   Rising investment holds out the hope of rising productivity. The
new equipment in effect helps workers increase their output and
their employers' revenue. The additional revenue is then available
to feed profits or raise wages, or both, without an increase in
prices. Labor costs, in fact, rose at a fairly mild 4.6 percent
annual rate in the second quarter _ edging up from last year's rate
of increase, but unchanged from the first quarter, the Labor
Department reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation has also risen slowly. The gross domestic products
report includes a price measure that is far broader than the
Consumer Price Index. It showed inflation rising at a 2.5 percent
annual rate in the second quarter. While that rate was higher than
last year's levels, partly because of gasoline prices, it fell from
a 3.3 percent rate in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The consumer, however, will determine the pace of economic
growth in the future, the latest gross domestic product report
suggests. Consumer spending in the second quarter increased at a
rate of only 3 percent, or less than half the 7.6 percent growth
rate in the first quarter.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Consumer spending slowed for basically everything, but the
really big slowdown was in motor vehicle sales,'' said Brent
Moulton, associate director of national economic accounts at the
Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis.
</P>
<P>
   With consumers spending less, inventories of unsold goods built
up at almost double the pace in the first quarter, with most of the
increase in motor vehicles parked in dealers' back lots. The
buildup almost certainly will result in a production slowdown until
the inventories are worked down, said Wynn Van Bussman, corporate
economist at DaimlerChrysler Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you will probably see is a delay or a cutback in the
production of new model cars,'' he said.

PILING ON AMAZON'S STOCK, AFTER THE FACT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miami)  (For release Sunday, July 30) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rats leaving a sinking ship.
</P>
<P>
   That unfortunate metaphor sprang to mind last Thursday when a
pack of formerly bullish stock analysts suddenly cooled on the
shares of Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   After the close of trading last Wednesday, Amazon reported its
second-quarter results. With remarkable synchronicity, six of the
35 analysts who follow Amazon cut their ratings on the stock the
next morning. Even Henry Blodget, Amazon's big believer at Merrill
Lynch, allowed that the company was going through ``an awkward
transition.'' Blodget opined that intermediate-term investors
should no longer ``buy'' the stock; they should ``accumulate'' it.
</P>
<P>
   Why the turnabout among Wall Street's finest analytical minds?
In Blodget's case, the company's revenues in the quarter missed his
estimate by $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Even in this weird investment age, it is hard to believe that
one equity analyst, forget the throng, would turn tail on a stock
because its revenues came in at $578 million rather than $585
million _ a difference of 1 percent. What scared the analysts _
just a guess _ was Amazon's falling stock.
</P>
<P>
   That is not surprising. Academic research shows that equity
analysts generally react to changes in stock prices rather than
cause them. Luckily for investors, the same cannot be said for debt
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   It has been about a month since Ravi Suria, a convertible bond
analyst at Lehman Brothers, penned his blistering report on
Amazon's prospects using words _ like distressed, deteriorating and
woeful _ that are rarely seen in equity reports. The stock fell 19
percent in the wake of the report, but most equity analysts stayed
positive on the company. Until last week.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all equity analysts are down on Amazon's shares.
Mary Meeker, the Internet analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
remains bullish. Her 12-page report on Amazon's second-quarter
results included such calculus as ``Notable Quotables From Jeff,''
three paragraphs of bon mots from Bezos. Example: ``We have a great
team. We have a common set of objectives. We have a plan to reach
those objectives.'' Research? Stenography might be a better word.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley may feel that bullish is the only way to be on
Amazon, because it is the company's investment banker and likely
holds a barrel of the company's convertible bonds, which are
trading in the cellar. The firm is the major market maker in the
debt.
</P>
<P>
   Meeker did not return a phone call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, Wall Street's remaining optimists could still be
trying to attract investment banking business. Sure, a new stock or
bond issue may not fly, but Amazon might want to retire its $1.9
billion in convertible debt. It would need a banker's help.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, such deals are usually done by companies in dire
straits, not a place Amazon finds itself now and Amazon says it
does not discuss its financing plans.
</P>
<P>
   But a company whose convertible debt is trading at depressed
levels can retire it by paying holders of the debt a fat premium to
the price the bonds fetch. The company pays bondholders in common
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Many convertible holders are eager to sell at a slight gain.
They wouldn't be taking on additional risk by getting more shares
in the company, because convertible holders are usually short the
underlying stock to hedge the equity position their bonds
represent.
</P>
<P>
   The only losers, of course, are the shareholders, whose stakes
are diluted by the issuance of shares to retire the debt. But maybe
they won't mind. After all, to many investors, Amazon has never
been just a stock. It's a religion. &QL;

ANTI-ABORTION WING LOSES EFFORT TO ALTER GOP PLATFORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The Republican Party platform committee Friday
rejected a proposal to remove the anti-abortion plank, and then
refused to adopt proposed new language saying that the GOP respects
the views of abortion-rights advocates.
</P>
<P>
   The action left embattled abortion rights advocates with only
two options: they can try to muster support for adoption of a
minority report that would call for support of abortion, or they
can try to bring the measure to the convention floor with the
support of six state delegations.
</P>
<P>
   In votes that appeared to confuse some of the 107 members of the
platform committee, the panel briefly adopted language for the
abortion plank that said: ``We welcome people on all sides of a
complex issue.'' But when some abortion opponents said the vote was
confusing and that similar but more general language is already in
the platform, the measure was defeated on a second vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to be welcomed into the party for about 10
minutes,'' said Ann Stone of Republicans for Choice after the two
votes were recorded. Stone, who early in the day all but vowed to
take the matter to the floor, sounded less certain Friday night,
saying a floor fight was an option. She said she would try to round
up support for a minority report, which would require the
signatures of one-fourth of the platform members.
</P>
<P>
   Acting by voice vote, the panel, dominated by conservative
members, overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to have the party
remain silent on abortion. By doing so, the committee was following
the wishes of the nominee-in-waiting, George W. Bush, who has said
the anti-abortion plank's call for a ``Human Life Amendment'' to
the Constitution should remain unchanged. While the Human Life
Amendment is not defined in the platform, most versions of it only
allow abortion when the life of the mother is at stake. Bush, by
contrast, supports exceptions for rape and incest as well as to
save the life of the mother .
</P>
<P>
   Abortion rights advocates tried in several ways to win some
measure of support. Earlier in the day, they asked a subcommittee
to approve language that said the party ``recognizes and respects''
the views of those who favor abortion rights. But the measure was
rejected 10-3 by the subcommittee and was later defeated by the
full committee.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin, chairman of the platform
committee, expressed shock Friday after being informed that the
abortion rights activists might try to take the issue to the floor.
If a majority of the delegates in six states agree, any issue may
be brought to the floor against the wishes of the party leadership.
While such a step would be difficult, abortion rights activists
said they might have enough votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that happens, then I won't have done my job,'' said
Thompson, who is under strict orders from the Bush campaign to
avoid a public fight on abortion, especially one that might erupt
on the floor and interrupt the party's carefully planned unity
message. The Thompson forces might, however, support the issuance
of a minority report in order to avoid a floor fight. The
possibility of such a fight remained unclear.
</P>
<P>
   The platform committee, and the subcommittee that took up the
issue earlier, were designed by GOP leaders to be dominated by
anti-abortion activists, many of whom made clear they would brook
no compromise on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm under the authority of the Creator of the Universe and he
is pro-life and always has been,'' said delegate Meribelle Bolton
of New Mexico. ``I am pro-life and nothing anyone can say will
change that position.''
</P>
<P>
   But Toni Casey of Los Altos Hills, Calif., decided to try
anyway. She proposed deleting the abortion language, urging her
colleagues on the subcommittee to stay silent on an issue ``that
divides us.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey urged the delegates to adopt language recognizing that
some Republicans disagree about abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would any of you object to recognizing there are diverse
views?'' Casey said. ``This platform does not even reflect the
position of our candidate, George W. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   But Representative Henry Hyde of Illinois, who is well known for
his anti-abortion views, led the fight against the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we should affirm that there are no insignificant
members of the human family, even though they are tiny and out of
sight,'' Hyde said during the meeting of the full platform
committee.
</P>
<P>
   The platform committee dealt with many other issues as well,
although none appeared as divisive as abortion. While the platform
upholds many of the party's conservative positions, it has a more
muted tone than past recent documents. For example, it deletes a
1996 plank that called for elimination of the Department of
Education. When some delegates tried to restore that plank in a
subcommittee Friday, the effort was quickly defeated by the allies
of Bush, who has said the federal government must play a more
activist role in helping improve the nation's schools.
</P>
<P>
   The platform is also somewhat more moderate than the 1996
document in removing language calling for English to be declared
the nation's official language, and denying some social services to
immigrants. Left unchanged was the party's official view against
same-sex marriage. A platform panel voted Friday to add language
opposing special civil rights protections for gays.

 &HT;    A Confederate warship, the first submersible in history to sink
an enemy vessel, is about to escape its own watery grave
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 30.
 &HT;    By Mike Toner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ The H.L. Hunley's lonely repose at the bottom
of Charleston Harbor is nearing an end. For archaeologists,
engineers and Civil War buffs who want to raise _ and save _ the
barnacle-encrusted icon of naval history, a high-stakes, high-tech
race against time is about to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Since it sank off Sullivans Island on the night of Feb. 17,
1864, the hand-cranked Confederate submarine has rested, largely
undisturbed, in the cool, murky waters of Charleston Harbor, just
1,000 yards from the spot it rammed a fatal torpedo into the side
of the Union sloop of war Housatonic.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after having ushered in the age of underwater warfare, the
Hunley promptly sank with its crew still on board.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in early August, five years after author Clive Cussler
and a team of underwater archaeologists discovered the sub's
location, an ocean-going crane will hoist the 40-foot submarine
from its watery grave _ and begin the process of solving some of
the 136-year-old mysteries that surround the sub.
</P>
<P>
   But the moment its iron hull leaves the waters of Charleston
Harbor, the submarine and everything aboard it will face a new
enemy, one that is even more relentless than the Union ships that
once blockaded these waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minute the Hunley reaches the surface, we will have a
ticking time bomb on our hands,'' says Maria Jacobsen, the
archaeologist who will direct the excavation of the interior of the
submarine after it is ashore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that is organic in nature, including human remains,
will begin to deteriorate almost immediately,'' Jacobsen says. ``We
won't have much time before some information is lost forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Divers' inspections of its exterior show nature has been kind to
the Hunley. Archaeologists say the sub filled with sediment soon
after it sank and was quickly covered by mud and sand. The cold,
dark, oxygen-starved conditions preserved the wreck so well that
when divers removed part of the torpedo spar from its hull this
summer, the bolt holding it turned at the touch of a wrench.
Archaeologists think the interior will be in even better shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ship and all of its contents are a true time capsule _ one
huge artifact,'' Jacobsen says. ``Everything that was aboard the
ship when it sank is still there. The whole story is intact. As
archaeologists, we just have to be sure we ask the right
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure that no scrap of information is lost, the Friends of
the Hunley, the nonprofit organization created by South Carolina to
raise public and private funds for the recovery of the sub, has
assembled an internationally recognized team of experts and built a
state-of-the-art 40,000-square-foot laboratory at the old
Charleston naval shipyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we hadn't been ready to do this the right way, and we
didn't have this lab ready, it would have been criminal to even
think about raising the Hunley,'' Jacobsen says.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Jacobsen, who has worked on shipwrecks from
Turkey to Texas, the team includes Project Director Robert Neyland,
who directs the Navy's underwater archaeology program; Leonard
Whitlock, a diver and veteran of salvage projects in a dozen
countries; David Conlin, an archaeologist for the Naval Historical
Center; and Paul Mardikian, a French conservator who helped
preserve artifacts from the Titanic. Eight forensics specialists
from the Smithsonian Institution will oversee the handling of any
human remains found on the sub.
</P>
<P>
   The project will cost at least $16 million. After five years of
preparation to raise the Hunley, it is likely to take a decade more
to preserve it and ready it for exhibition at the Charleston
Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The first hours and days after the submarine is raised from the
deep will be critical to the success of the project. As it is
hoisted off the bottom, the Hunley will be encased in a cocoon of
metal supports, slings and foam-filled bags that divers have
assembled around it to reduce the strain on its hull. Because the
rivets in the iron-plated hull have loosened over time, the
precautions will prevent the submarine from bursting open like an
overripe melon when it reaches the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Once it is safely aboard the crane barge Karlissa B, the
submarine will be sprayed continually with a mist of seawater as it
is transported up Cooper River to the laboratory. There, it will be
placed in a custom 55-foot-long tank and covered with water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is precious,'' Jacobsen says. ``We hope to have the
Hunley in the tank in less than 24 hours. Once it's safely there,
everyone will breathe a tremendous sigh of relief.''
</P>
<P>
   But archaeologists won't have much time to celebrate. ``The
changes that will begin occurring almost immediately will be like
Damocles' sword hanging over our heads,'' Jacobsen says.
</P>
<P>
   By immersing it in fresh water, project scientists hope to
retard the growth of marine bacteria and fungi that could cause
further deterioration of the exposed submarine. To slow any
changes, the water will be chilled to 50 degrees, requiring the
archaeologists to wear wet suits while they work. To ease any
strain on the hull, the submarine will rest in the tank at the same
45-degree list at which it now rests on the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists usually excavate shipwrecks in the sea and
recover only pieces of a ship and its contents. Only a few sunken
ships _ King Henry VIII's Mary Rose in England, the Vasa in Sweden,
and La Salle's ship, the Belle, in Texas _ have been raised and
preserved in their entirety.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Hunley has been placed in the laboratory tank,
scientists will X-ray the entire submarine, mapping the hull with
millimeter precision. A video camera on a fiber optic cable _ an
adaptation of a surgical endoscope _ will then explore the inside.
It may be a month or more before archaeologists venture inside to
begin excavating the contents.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobsen hopes the excavation can be completed by the end of the
year. A walk-in refrigerator _ the same kind used in morgues _ will
hold any human remains and other organic matter the archaeologists
find.
</P>
<P>
   There already have been some surprises. In preparing the
submarine for raising, for instance, archaeologists discovered that
the attack spar _ the harpoonlike device on the front of the
submarine _ was actually secured at the bottom of the bow, not the
top of the bow as once thought. The lower position made it easier
to plant an explosive charge below the waterline of an enemy ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the real surprises will be on the inside,'' says project
historian Mark Ragan. ``If the Hunley sank because it was too close
to the Housatonic when the torpedo exploded, we will be able to see
where the pressure wave buckled the iron plates.''
</P>
<P>
   Key questions archaeologists hope to answer in the coming months
include: Did the Hunley sink because of that collateral damage or
was it scuttled in keeping with the crew's alleged suicide pact?
How many men _ eight or nine _ were aboard the Hunley when she
sank, and who were they? And what technological innovations in the
little vessel _ so far known only from drawings and sketches _
enabled it to make the first successful submarine attack in
history?
</P>
<P>
   Although each type of item _ leather, glass, wood, brass, tin
and cast iron _ poses special problems for conservators, the
biggest challenge will be preserving the submarine, whose various
metal components have been decaying at vastly different rates for
the past 136 years. The largest objects will require years of
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hunley is like a large whale in a small aquarium,''
Mardikian says. ``It will require constant care. If we don't handle
the sub properly, it could end up as nothing but a pile of dust.
Frankly, to treat each of these materials properly, I think we may
have to take it apart piece by piece, stabilize each piece, and
then put it back together.''

 &HT;    Dead sailors may have own secrets to share
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Before sand and silt packed them like
skeletal sardines inside the Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley, the
remains of Lt. George Dixon and his crewmen deteriorated into a
jumble of bones.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's what archaeologists believed until a recent
discovery suggested something more exciting _ and creepier.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a possibility they are embedded in the sediment
pretty much in the position they died in,'' said state Sen. Glenn
McConnell (R-Charleston), chairman of the state-appointed Hunley
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, McConnell added, there's a ``good possibility''
archaeologists will recover fragments of flesh, hair and clothing,
plus skeletons that remain relatively intact.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers believe a churning, back-and-forth rip current
helped preserve the vessel and its victims by piling sand around
its hull. If sediment covered the bodies in as quickly as two to
four months, McConnell said, it's possible the lack of oxygen
prevented crabs and other creatures from devouring the flesh and
ligaments attaching the bones. A lack of oxygen could also have
limited the decay of clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody hopes they are still wrapped in their
overcoats,'' said Mark Ragan, the project historian.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it has yet to be confirmed that the crew is inside the
Hunley. But lacking historical evidence that the sailors escaped
the nighttime sinking, archaeologists believe they'll find their
remains during excavation of the Hunley's contents.
</P>
<P>
   And if the remains are well-preserved, modern technology could
allow researchers to learn far more about the men _ and the lives
they led _ than historical accounts have provided.
</P>
<P>
   By examining bones and teeth, for example, a Smithsonian
Institution team expects to learn what kind of health the crewmen
were in and how tall they were, said David Hunt, a skeletal
biologist at the Smithsonian.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers will try to pin down the sailors' ethnic origins by
comparing their skulls with others in the Smithsonian's database,
Hunt said.
</P>
<P>
   Working with plaster and clay and three-dimensional photographic
images of the skulls, the Smithsonian's specialists will be able to
reconstruct the crewmen's faces.
</P>
<P>
   And by testing the sand for remains of food, it's conceivable
that ``something under the microscope could tell you what their
last meal was,'' said Maria Jacobsen, the project's senior
archaeologist.
</P>
<P>
   Although there's hope the bodies could be relatively
well-preserved, Jacobsen said she still expects to recover a
``jumble of bones,'' along with pieces of shoes and clothing, belt
buckles, tools and navigational gear, such as a depth gauge or
compass.
</P>
<P>
   Hunley researchers have a photograph they believe to be of
Dixon. According to historical accounts, the young lieutenant from
the 21st Alabama Infantry Regiment suffered a leg wound in 1862 at
the battle of Shiloh in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the best clues to help archaeologists identify
any of the remains, said McConnell, the Hunley Commission chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The night before the sub will be raised, an Episcopal church in
Charleston plans a formaors, alongside the Hunley's two previous
crews. Those crews of 13 sailors drowned in test runs of the sub.

<P>
   TUKTOYAKTUK, Northwest Territories _ In this Arctic village,
beachfront real estate means a summer view of polar sea ice
glinting a few miles offshore.
</P>
<P>
   But last summer, Inuvialuit natives here on the northern edge of
Canada had front-row seats for unusual open-water traffic _ a
Chinese research vessel examining ice conditions, a Russian boat
towing a huge drydock from Siberia and an American cruise ship
navigating the once forbidden Northwest Passage.
</P>
<P>
   For four centuries, explorers and shipping executives have
dreamed of sending ships from Europe to Asia across the top of
North America. The quest for an Arctic shortcut consumed hundreds
of lives, becoming a romantic obsession in Victorian times. Even
though successful passages were finally made in the 20th century,
the route was written off as impractical because its labyrinthine
channels seemed to be perpetually frozen.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as global temperatures rise, a Northwest Passage no longer
seems like an adventurer's pipe dream. But for Canadians worried
about inexperienced freighter captains' probing Arctic waters, the
dream could become a nightmare if the fragile environment becomes
the Panama Canal of the North.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is an accident, who is going to wear the damage?''
Col. Pierre Leblanc warned this week as he stepped down as
commander of Canada's northern military forces in Yellowknife.
``It's going to be the Canadian islands. If the freighter is
registered in the Bahamas, there will be $34 in the bank for
cleanup.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade after the Exxon Valdez spilled 10.5 million gallons of
crude oil off the Alaska coast, the environmental effects remain
visible, Leblanc added.
</P>
<P>
   While scientists argue about the causes of global warming, they
generally agree that world temperatures are rising. In a flurry of
conferences and articles this summer, scientists also are saying
that warming is most visible in the extreme polar latitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Here in this village of caribou hunters, where melting
permafrost is causing some houses to tilt, scientists who are using
satellite and submarine data are confirming what native elders have
been saying all along. According to NASA analyses of satellite
photographs, the late summer expanse of open waters of the Beaufort
Sea roughly tripled from 1996 to 1998, to 375,000 square miles.
</P>
<P>
   In the eastern Arctic, as warmer waters push farther north, the
ice sheet that covers most of Greenland is losing 1.25 trillion
gallons of fresh water a year, enough to sustain all 120 million
households in the United States for almost five months, according
to a new article in Science magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the late summer icecap of the North Pole has shrunk 6
percent over the last 20 years, according to NASA. Of greatest
concern, though, is that the average thickness of Arctic icecap has
thinned 42 percent since the 1950s, according to sonar measurements
by U.S. and British submarines.
</P>
<P>
   If those trends continue, some scientists predict, by the second
half of 21st century, the polar icecap, which covers 80 percent of
the Arctic Ocean at its September minimum, could vanish every
summer.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``What people see now is not what they saw centuries ago,'' said
Ann Savours, author of ``The Search for the North West Passage,''
(St. Martin's Press 1999), one of several recent books on the
passage. ``The ice has deteriorated, or improved, depending on how
you look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The opening of the Arctic to commercial navigation could bring
the biggest change in American shipping routes since the Panama
Canal opened in 1914. Ships taking cargo from Rotterdam to Yokohama
could cut 5,000 miles, almost cutting travel time in half from the
Panama route.
</P>
<P>
   On the far side of the Arctic from here, shipping companies are
finalizing plans to send freighters with reinforced hulls steaming
in summer months through the Northeast Passage, a route above
Russia that similarly nearly halves the time and distance compared
to the Suez Canal route between Hamburg and Yokohama. With fewer
islands, fewer icebergs and more open water, the Northeast Passage
is considered safer than Canada's treacherous maze of straits and
channels.
</P>
<P>
   For now, high insurance costs, the threat of icebergs, the need
for icebreakers and expensive reinforced hulls and an extremely
short open-water season keep all but the most prepared sea captains
from attempting the Northwest Passage. But Canadians fear a
confluence of events that would place enormous pressure on their
passage, including 10 additional years of global warming and an
accident that could block the Panama Canal, which 14,000 ships a
year transit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the canal closes for whatever reason, there will be a lot
of pressure to go up north,'' Leblanc said. Although the numbers
are small, he said, the number of cruise ships venturing into the
Canadian Arctic has steadily increased, from one in 1990 to 15 last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   The cruise ships, he said, generally follow the Polar Code, a
book of Canadian regulations for shipping north of the 60th
Parallel _ double hulls, cold-weather emergency gear, filing of
routes and captains and crews trained in Arctic navigation.
</P>
<P>
   Three summers ago, one cruise ship ran aground on a sandbar. The
Canadian military fears that a ship might hit a rock or an iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any military helicopters pre-positioned in the
north,'' said Lt. Mark Gough, northern spokesman for the Canadian
military, the agency in charge of search and rescue. All the
emergency teams are based along the U.S. border, the usual area for
accidents. But as measured in air distances, those rescue bases are
closer to the Equator than to the North Pole.
</P>
<P>
   Leblanc posed what some people here call ``the Titanic
question.'' ``If you have a cruise ship going down with 400 to 500
people,'' he asked, ``who goes to rescue the people? How do you do
it?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Canada's Arctic will be used more and more by air
travelers as a shortcut between North America and Asia. Canada and
Russia began allowing regular commercial flights this month over
the North Pole region. Leblanc predicted that within five years,
there could be as many 500 polar flights a day, carrying as many as
35 million people a year over the Canadian Arctic.

   While foreign airlines follow international safety standards and
accept Canada's control of its airspace, many foreign countries do
not recognize Canadian sovereignty over its Arctic waters and many
foreign shippers say they are not bound to follow Canada's Polar
Code.
</P>
<P>
   In a debate that once was the preserve of academics, the United
States and the major shipping nations of Europe argue that the
waters of the Northwest Passage constitute international straits,
just like the Strait of Gilbraltar or the Dardanelles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our view is very clear: we view the Northwest Passage as a
strait for international navigation,'' said J. Ashley Roach, a
State Department lawyer. ``The international transit regime applies
there, just as it does through the Cape Horn as it does through the
Indonesian Archipelago, strait of Singapore.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian and the U.S. governments have agreed to disagree on
the issue. Reflecting scientific and safety cooperation between
both countries, the commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard, James Loy,
and his Canadian counterpart made a joint visit in late July to the
U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Healy as it steamed through the Northwest
Passage, with Canadian permission.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this particular transit, we crossed the t's and dotted
the i's, but the U.S. definitely has not changed its position,''
said Commander George DuPree, chief of the U.S. Coast Guard's
icebreaking division. ``The Northwest Passage is an international
strait that any vessel can transit under the right of innocent
passage.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Because U.S. and European governments do not view the passage as
internal Canadian waters, they do not believe that their ships are
regulated by Canada's Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act, a
1970 law that allows Canada to bar any ship deemed to pose a
pollution hazard. With the safety regulations debate snagged on the
sovereignty issue, there is little progress in adopting
international standards for Arctic navigation.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada's far north, where a jeep ride across the tundra can
mar the landscape for decades, residents worry that foreign
shipping companies will try to save money by cutting through
Arctic, leaving Canada to foot the cleanup bills. They say that,
despite the international outcry over the Exxon Valdez spill, no
new double-hulled oil tanker has been added to the Alaska route
since the spill, in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impact of pollution in the Arctic is enormous,'' said
Richard Nerysoo, president of the Tribal Council of the Gwich'in, a
large native group near the Beaufort Sea. ``I take a strong stand
for Canada setting the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Others fear that ships arriving unannounced could cut through
sea ice, leaving Inuit hunters marooned on ice flows, or that water
tanker ships would fill with melting glacier water, after pumping
into the Arctic bilge water contaminated with foreign organisms.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an environment you want to take chances with,''
said Joseph L. Handley, the territorial minister of finance, in an
interview in Yellowknife. ``People don't realize that things don't
re-grow up here, they don't replenish they way they do down
south.''

 &HT;    Louisiana cop unravels a haunted past
 &HT;    Eds: Embargeod for Sunday, July 30.
 &HT;      FICTION
 &HT;    ``Purple Cane Road'' by James Lee Burke. Doubleday. $24.95. 336
pages.
 &HT;    The verdict: Dave Robicheaux is back with a vengeance.
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After appearing in 11 novels, James Lee Burke's Louisiana police
Detective Dave Robicheaux should be as stale as a month-old box of
Krispy Kremes.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to Burke's ability to create new challenges from a
fascinating gallery of rogues, he's back with renewed vigor in
``Purple Cane Road.'' Novelist Carl Hiaasen's South Florida _
crawling with corruption _ is nothing compared with Burke's
territory. From New Orleans to New Iberia, the drug dealers,
prostitutes, crooked cops and dirty politicians outnumber the
crawfish.
</P>
<P>
   In this novel, Robicheaux has to deal with many of these
unsavory characters as well as the mystery of his mother's
disappearance years earlier. Married to a brawling, alcoholic
Cajun, Mae ran off to California with a soldier who slicked his
hair down with Lucky Tiger and filled her head with dreams of
Hollywood. A few weeks later she was back, broke and brokenhearted.
Other men came along, and the last time the middle-aged detective
saw his mother, he was a teenager and she was dancing with a drunk
in a roadhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The memories remained buried for 30 years, along with unanswered
questions about his mother's disappearance. Then one day a pimp
mentions to Robicheaux that Mae died at the hands of two New
Orleans cops who were working for the mob.
</P>
<P>
   In his attempt to uncover the sins of the past, Robicheaux
follows a trail of conspiracy and corruption that leads to high
government officials. More complications arise when the detective
finds new evidence in a murder case that put a sexually abused
woman on death row for killing her molester.
</P>
<P>
   Like the works of Raymond Chandler, two-time Edgar Award winner
Burke's crime novels transcend the mystery genre. His books are
character-driven and written with lush, literary descriptions of
southern Louisiana:
</P>
<P>
   ``That night I dreamed about a sugar harvest in the late fall
and mule-drawn wagons loaded with cane moving through the fog
toward the mill. The dirt road was frozen hard and littered with
stalks of sugarcane, and the fog rolled out of the unharvested cane
on each side of the road like colorless cotton candy and coated the
mules' and drivers' backs with moisture.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the finest prose in the world is meaningless without
an appealing, sympathetic protagonist, and Dave Robicheaux fits
that role perfectly. Like most of Burke's characters, Robicheaux is
flawed and damaged. A recovering alcoholic whose first wife was
killed by shotgun-wielding bad guys, Robicheaux struggles with his
own demons as he dispenses justice _ and sometimes revenge _
swiftly and violently.
</P>
<P>
   In a few of his Robicheaux novels, Burke has shown signs of
being bored with his character. Switching to a Texas setting with
lawyer Bob Holland in ``Heartwood'' and ``Cimarron Rose''
apparently gave the author a second wind. ``Purple Cane'' is one of
his best efforts yet, with writing so vivid that readers can almost
smell the stink of the alleys and swamps and taste the forbidden
Jax beer and bourbon that tantalize Dave Robicheaux every waking
moment.

 &HT;    Dr. Suess enjoys resurgence
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 30/
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You may not feel it yet _ but you will. A punchy, giddy
sensation, like laughing gas, will seep into your noggin. You'll
speak in goofy rhymes. You'll invent weird names for animals _
Hippo-no-Hungus, say, for your overweight beagle. You'll have a
compulsion to balance stacks of boxes unwisely, with the biggest on
top and the smallest on the bottom. On one finger. While hurtling
down a mountain on a car the size of a turtle.
</P>
<P>
   Named Yertle.
</P>
<P>
   You'll catch it: Seuss Fever.
</P>
<P>
   Or you'll have to work overtime to stay immune, with the wave of
Seussian art and entertainment that's ready to break over America
in the coming months. Nine years after his death, Pulitzer
Prize-winning artist and children's author Theodor Seuss Geisel is
enjoying ``a fabulous resurgence.'' The words are from Audrey
Geisel, his widow and kindred spirit (wacky in her own right), who
as chief executive officer of Dr. Seuss Enterprises personally
approves or vetoes all spinoffs from her husband's magical world.
</P>
<P>
   Now on the national stage, or waiting in the wings:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Seussical,'' a stage musical that gathers favorite Seuss
characters into an original yarn, begins performances Oct. 15 at
Broadway's Richard Rodgers Theatre after a tryout in Boston. The
core of the superb creative team from 1998's ``Ragtime,'' including
Tony Award-winning set designer Eugene Lee, returns. Lee's sneak
preview: ``We fire these bizarre Seussian double-barrel cannons at
the audience, but only ribbons shoot out _ no lawsuits.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Dr. Seuss' `How the Grinch Stole Christmas,''' the Universal
Studios adaptation of the beloved book, opens Nov. 17. It stars Jim
Carrey as the titular Scroogelike creature who strips Whoville of
its holiday stuff but finds that spirit is a permanent fixture.
Audrey Geisel met Carrey on the set of ``Man on the Moon,'' and
``as I was leaving,'' she says, ``he put his hands on my shoulders,
looked me in the eyes and scrinched, and scrunched, and scroonched
his face into such a wicked smile that I gasped, `My God! It's the
Grinch!'''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Secret Art of Dr. Seuss,'' a 1995 Random House volume
depicting Geisel's sculptures and paintings _ some of them
surprisingly provocative, if not anatomically correct _ helped
create a hot market for reproductions at 110 outlets, including the
Ann Jackson Gallery in Roswell (see article at left).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Cat in the Hat,'' the movie, looks as though it will
finally get made. A five-year option by DreamWorks expired after
several screenplays failed to win approval from Steven Spielberg
and/or Audrey Geisel, but she expects to announce a deal with a new
producer soon.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Seuss Landing, a theme park that opened last year at Universal
Orlando, has a cafe selling green eggs and ham (watch out,
McDonald's!). Palm trees with a weird ``S'' curve in their trunks
(the result of the trees' being almost flattened by Hurricane
Andrew, then resumingvertical growth) and topiaries shaped like
hands create a trippy Seussian landscape.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Oh, the Places You'll Go!,'' Seuss' farewell book of 1990,
recently re-ascended to The New York Times Best Seller List, as it
often does in summer when its words of dizzy wisdom are quoted at
school commencements. Seuss' 47 books sold 100 million copies
during his lifetime, and some of them, including the all-time
favorites, ``Green Eggs and Ham'' and ``The Cat in the Hat,'' are
selling better now than when they broke out in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Oreos with green filling
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, not a bad comeback for a man _ or should we say
ageless kid? _ who worked in a variety of advertising, film and
magazine cartooning jobs well into his 50s, when he finally
achieved literary stardom with his back-to-back children's books
``Cat'' and ``Grinch'' (1957). His middle name was Seuss _ or was
it Mischief? The first time he signed ``Seuss'' on a drawing, in a
Dartmouth College humor magazine in 1921, it was because, as
punishment for a bootleg-gin party, the dean had forbidden him from
publishing cartoons. And he didn't. At least, not under the name
Ted Geisel.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Dr.'' in ``Dr. Seuss'' was added later, he said, for the
degree he never got from Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Springfield, Mass., in 1904, the grandson of a
successful German-born brewer, Geisel bestrode the 20th century,
going to Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show as a boy and yet creating,
at midcentury, a look for children's books that still seems almost
futuristic. In the words of Lane Smith, who designed the movie
``James and the Giant Peach'' and consulted on the designs for
``Grinch,'' the movie: ``At a time when kids' readers said, `See
Spot run,' Ted had this big weird cat barge into a house when the
kid's parents weren't home and let Thing 1 and Thing 2 out of a
box! If that's not releasing the id, what is?
</P>
<P>
   ``Ted was subversive and educational,'' Smith adds, ``way ahead
of his time.''
</P>
<P>
   So far ahead that America, it seems, is still catching up. Which
raises the question, Why is Seuss so hot at this moment? Why is the
Seuss estate, which until now has not aggressively cashed in on the
artist's images (compared to, say, Disney) and was so picky about
the ``Cat'' scripts, now green-lighting so many projects?
</P>
<P>
   ``Ted was never much interested in the commercial end _ in fact,
a couple of times he sent back a large sum of money because he was
not happy with the way his work was being used,'' says lawyer Karl
ZoBell, who handles Dr. Seuss Enterprises affairs from his office
just down the street from the Geisel home on the oceanside bluffs
of La Jolla, Calif. ``Just after his death, there was a flood of
counterfeit stuff _ obscene Seuss T-shirts, for instance. Finally
we accepted the reality that the way to beat these things in court
was to get out there and license products ourselves, with taste and
restraint.''
</P>
<P>
   But those two words don't always describe millennial America.
The Grinch movie, like the sleigh the Grinch uses to rob Whoville,
will whoosh across the nation carrying heaps of Seussian stuff. The
licensed merchandise will include interactive plush toys,
inflatable Who furniture, fur-covered Who shoes and Oreo cookies
with green filling that can be left on the holiday hearth with a
card that says, ``Dear Mr. Grinch: Please don't steal my toys.''
Plus the antlers that the Grinch straps on Max, his woebegone mutt,
to disguise him as a reindeer, in different sizes for your head,
your child's head and, yes, your dog's head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything in this movie is an original creation, down to the
doorknobs, so it's a once-in-a-lifetime property,'' says Jill
Jones, a vice president of Universal Studios Consumer Products.
</P>
<P>
   One wonders whether college student Ted _ when he doodled a dog
with strapped-on antlers in the margins of his notebook almost 80
years ago _ knew he was creating a ``property.'' One wonders
whether, after holding off the temptations of commercial
exploitation for so long, Dr. Seuss Enterprises is beginning to
give way, like a dam in a flood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The licensing agreements exceed our dreams and expectations,''
says ZoBell, ``but it's a only a fraction of what it could be.
There are a thousand (deals) we could be doing, but we only choose
40 to 60. Like I said, taste and restraint.'' ZoBell declines to
put a dollar figure on the deals, but Business Week magazine
estimates that they're worth $7 million to $10 million per year.
</P>
<P>
   Adding a dimension
</P>
<P>
   On the artistic side, the Seuss legacy appears to be in good
hands with the creators of the fall's big events, ``Grinch'' and
``Seussical.'' They've given careful thought to the tricky
transformation of Seuss' book illustrations into the
three-dimensional worlds of film and theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grinch'' production designer Michael Corenblith, 49, who teams
again with Ron Howard, his director from ``Apollo 13,'' says his
``Grinch'' sets are a tribute not just to the Christmas tale but
``a celebration of Ted's body of work.'' Viewers should not expect
a live-action replica of the 1966 television version of ``How the
Grinch Stole Christmas'' (which featured the animation of Chuck
Jones and the voice of Boris Karloff), but a story with a more
fully imagined Whoville and Grinch cave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ron told me he wanted everything just barely in balance,
miraculously standing up,'' Corenblith said. His Whoville was
inspired by a trip to the famous spiral ramp of New York's
Guggenheim Museum and by a lesser-known, 1949 Seuss book,
``Bartholomew and the Oobleck,'' with depictions of zany circular
stairways and crooked bell towers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ted soaked these images up from medieval and Moorish
architecture, and they crop up obsessively in his work,''
Corenblith said. The curving, 50-foot-high ``flying bridges'' that
the designer constructed between buildings made Universal
executives nervous, but Corenblith refused to fit them with safety
features, because ``Ted never drew a handrail in his life!'' Cirque
du Soleil acrobats were hired to play the risk-taking Whos.
</P>
<P>
   Costume designer Rita Ryack, also in her late 40s, says, ``Dr.
Seuss had a profound influence on me _ he was so witty and skewed.
People remember his work as adorable, but it was a little dark, you
know?'' Accordingly, she dresses Carrey's Grinch in ``a Grim
Reaper's cape'' and ``a sort of Playboy bathrobe, black fishnet.''
</P>
<P>
   To show the ``spoofy Norman Rockwell quality'' of the Whos and
to recapture her own memories of ``the early Seuss books, before
`Cat,''' Ryack insisted on ``costume materials that existed then,
in the '50s.'' Her ``nutty kinetic hats'' rarely sit still on
actors' heads but bob around on the ends of springs.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Seussical,'' the 60-ish Lee is working in an utterly
different style from the rugged architectural mode he pioneered on
Broadway (``Sweeney Todd,'' ``Show Boat''). Adapting the concentric
circles on the cover of ``Oh, the Places You'll Go!,'' he ``made
them the portals into Seuss' world,'' he says. ``In the center of
them, as you enter the theater, you see the Cat in the Hat's hat _
rotating.'' Picking up on the ``tacked-together, Rube Goldberg
quality'' of Seussian objects, Lee also designed a huge, puppetlike
bird, the Tufted Mazurka (``from the island of Yerka''), ``whose
neck is ridiculously long and whose head is ridiculously small,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a handmade quality about these set pieces,'' the
designer adds. ``For instance, when a character spreads some magic
seeds and trees spring up _ it's just a roll drop (with tree
silhouettes) being rolled up from the stage, very old-fashioned
technology. It's more faithful to the character of the Seuss
drawings than some electronic effects might be.''
</P>
<P>
   `Amazed at the fuss'
</P>
<P>
   Faithful is also the watchword of Audrey Geisel, who presides
over Ted's legacy from the La Jolla home they shared. Clearly, his
zany spirit lives in her. She answers the phone, ``Seuss house!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even as I sit now, looking at the grand and glorious Pacific,
my feet are on the desk, and that's from him,'' she says. ``Ted's
feet were never not on this desk. He was very lean and limber, but
only in that respect was he like Ichabod Crane. I'm not sure what
that means; make of it what you will. Anyhow, Ted would come
whizzing into this room and say, `I've got an idea and I think it
will work!' Then he'd scuttle back to the studio. But where those
ideas came from, who can say?''
</P>
<P>
   What would he think of his ``fabulous resurgence''?
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd be more puzzled than anyone,'' she declares. ``He was
just this side of a humble man, so he was always amazed at the
fuss. Ted was not especially big on kids himself (he had none from
his two marriages) _ they worried him a bit, made him uncomfortable
_ but he understood exactly where they're coming from. He didn't
want his books to be in the classroom, but in the after-school
hours when the kids' minds could be free and outrageous. He'd often
ask me, `Am I being too preacher-ish?,' because he had a fear of
that, but in some subtle way his values were always in there.''
</P>
<P>
   What was his greatest tribute?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a Princeton commencement, near the end of his life,''
his widow recalls. ``He was about to speak when the entire
graduating class stood up. They recited `Green Eggs and Ham' _
every ... single ... word, perfectly, as if with one voice. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Geisel pauses for a moment, her voice becoming thick with
emotion _ then releases the tension with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy,'' she cries, ``Ted didn't see that one coming!''

 &HT;    Tour putting better face on gangster rap
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 30.
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The man who set gangster rap to music 13 years ago is bringing
his first-ever national tour to Atlanta on Friday, and it's hard to
decide which is the most interesting detail.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that producer Dr. Dre is on a 40-city tour with the
artists who have made the most of his sinister rhythms is kind of
like an official announcement that hip-hop's most offensive
subgenre is back. Big time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Dre 2001'' has remained in the Top 25 on Billboard's pop
chart since its November 1999 debut (22 of those weeks it was in
the Top 10) and sold more than 5 million copies _ matching the
sales of the most recent project he has produced, Eminem's album
``The Marshall Mathers LP,'' No. 1 for the past eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite offstage troubles that include at least five pending
criminal charges, the ``Up in Smoke'' concert lineup onstage is
proving that a hip-hop performance can be as much of a smooth,
elaborate production as the artists' videos. And people who attend
these shows can behave themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Which has been in doubt for some time.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, rap fans had to spend much of the 1990s content with
seeing their favorite artists only on BET or MTV, because promoters
refused to book them, venues didn't welcome them or it cost way too
much to secure them.
</P>
<P>
   The flip side is that when the occasional rap show did occur _
usually in a club _ it was rarely good.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a banner hanging from the ceiling with the artist's
name on it, that was considered flashy. You could forget about an
actual set, dancers, costumes or that kind of thing. ``Rappers
showed up late, walked from one side of the stage to the other like
a caged panther and left,'' remembers Hot-97.5 radio announcer Ryan
Cameron. ``Usually early.''
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1997, the party- and clothes-minded Sean ``Puffy'' Combs
launched his 25-city ``No Way Out'' tour, taking the lineup of
radio-friendly rap and R&AMP;B artists to major venues across the
country, including Atlanta's Georgia Dome. The somewhat more
profane Jay-Z followed in 1999 with the ``Hard Knock Life'' tour,
and though it didn't have the pyrotechnics and costume changes of
``No Way Out,'' it was the first major-venue, all-rap tour since
Run-DMC's in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Cash Money/Ruff Ryders tour _ which
combined the material excesses of Combs and the profanity of Jay-Z
with its own sexual explicitness _ hit the country with only one
major incident, when five people were stabbed backstage in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the big Up in Smoke gangster rap tour, which started
June 15 in San Diego and is set to end Aug. 20 in Denver. The
four-hour production, with multiple backdrops, includes a talking
skull; the touted reunion of the first act to receive a threatening
letter from the FBI, N.W.A.; and Eminem, the object of ire from
many gay rights and women's groups.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its negative images, organizers of the event, who
include basketball star Earvin ``Magic'' Johnson, say they are
pleased.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the performers haven't been dogged by personal
troubles. Eminem's wife attempted suicide, and police in Detroit
made him clothe the blow-up dolls he uses in his act. The bill's
only singer, Nate Dogg, was charged with beating up his girlfriend
and setting fire to her mother's car. And Detroit officials
threatened to arrest performers if they showed an eight-minute
video in which Dre and Dogg hang out with topless women, then shoot
some robbers.
</P>
<P>
   So far, none of that has affected performances. All the
headliners have made every show, promoters say, and the shows have
run on time. Most of the reviews of this decidedly misogynistic,
drug-espousing men's night out have been positive. And industry
magazine Pollstar says it's looking like one of the top-grossing
tours of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll take a little controversy over the content _ and it is
insignificant content _ over a substantive issue like a security
problem or violence any day,'' promoter Bill Silva told The New
York Times. ``We're firing on all cylinders.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything is going up in smoke, it could be the widespread
underestimation of this music's appeal and potential, despite its
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Up in Smoke Tour
</P>
<P>
   With Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminemand Warren G. 8 p.m. Friday. $30
lawn, $45 reserved at Ticketmaster, 404-249-6400 or

   Talk radio. It's not just for broadcast anymore. You can get it
on the Web, too.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-hitting, rude-boy antics of the Hot Talk radio format
are a big draw in other parts of the country. Though it hasn't made
it to the airwaves of Atlanta, you can get a taste on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Hot Talk's most recognizable practitioner, Howard Stern, gets
the star treatment on the King of All Media site (www.koam.com).
It's not an official site, but a fan-produced tribute that's up to
date and informative. You can't actually hear Stern's show online
anywhere, but the site includes a hyperlinked list of radio
stations that carry it. There are audio files of clips from Stern's
show online, though, including a long list at Heynow's Web page
(www
</P>
<P>
   .angelfire.com/ny/heynow2). In Orlando, the popular WTKS-FM is
home to Hot Talk (www.wtks
</P>
<P>
   .com) and carries Stern's show.
</P>
<P>
   On the lighter side, eYada (eyada.com) dishes out entertainment
news and talk about movies, music and celebrity gossip. The site's
roster of hosts includes former Sex Pistol Johnny Rotten and the
New York Daily News husband-and-wife gossip team George Rush and
Joanna Molloy.
</P>
<P>
   Since this is the World Wide Web, you can even get talk radio in
a variety of tongues. Radio Romania International (www.rri.ro)
streams three channels of news, commentary and interviews in
Romanian. From Brazil, you can get news and sports in Portuguese
from Radio Gaucha (www.rdgaucha.com.br). The station's Web site
also has a list of several other Brazilian stations. For foreign
stations, one of the best online resources is Ituner
(www.ituner.com), with a clickable map that leads you to the
geographic location beneath your cursor.
</P>
<P>
   There's no need to go around the world for talk. You can get
local talk on your computer, too. Atlanta's own WSB (www
</P>
<P>
   .accessatlanta.com/partners
</P>
<P>
   /wsbradio) and The Zone/WQXI-AM 790 (www.790thezone.com), our
local sports-talk station, are both available on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For a sampling of what's available in talk radio online,
BroadcastAmerica.com devotes a section to online radio chat that is
broken down by region and format (talk.broadcastamerica.com). You
can also get a list of talk stations and links at Real.com
(www.real.com).

 &HT;    Four Republicans mull run against Miller
 &HT;    By Alan Judd and James Salzer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The potential Republican field for the U.S. Senate
apparently is down to four.
</P>
<P>
   State School Superintendent Linda Schrenko; former Sen. Mack
Mattingly; Lewis Jordan, the man who ran ValuJet Airlines; and Rep.
Jack Kingston are the final Republicans considering a run for the
Senate seat formerly held by the late Paul Coverdell.
</P>
<P>
   None went so far Friday as declaring for the Nov. 7 special
election. But all were weighing their options as next week's
candidate qualifying period approaches. Schrenko said she would
decide today.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all the boys bow out, I think I'll keep my name in the
hat,'' Schrenko said. ``All things being equal, I would rather be
in the majority in Washington than in a minority in Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Mattingly, who held the post from 1981 to 1987, and Jordan both
expressed strong interest in the race Friday, said Chuck Clay,
chairman of the Georgia Republican Party. Repeated efforts to reach
both potential candidates were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, it's in their laps as to whether one, both or
neither will get in,'' Clay said of Mattingly and Jordan. ``The
longer it goes, the more likely it is for more people to get in.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kingston said in Washington that he will wait to see
whether any of the others run before he makes a final decision. The
rest of the eight Republicans in Georgia's congressional delegation
have already declined to run.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Zell Miller, a Democrat, took over Coverdell's
Senate seat this week and will run in the nonpartisan special
election.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders have become increasingly frustrated by their
inability to recruit a single top-tier candidate to challenge
Miller, a popular and well-known political figure whose approval
rating topped 80 percent when he left the governor's office.
</P>
<P>
   Mattingly held the seat for one six year-term, then lost in 1986
to Democrat Wyche Fowler.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has never sought public office. He is best known for his
handling of the aftermath of a ValuJet plane in the Florida
Everglades in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Schrenko has twice won statewide elections and has been
mentioned as a possible candidate for governor in 2002. The state
Constitution would require her to give up her current post if she
sought the Senate job, said Chris Riggall, a spokesman for
Secretary of State Cathy Cox, Georgia's chief elections officer.
</P>
<P>
   The superintendent said she is torn between wanting to keep the
U.S. Senate seat Republican and abandoning state teachers in their
political fight with Gov. Roy Barnes over education reform.
</P>
<P>
   Schrenko said she isn't necessarily counting on backing from the
Republican Party establishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I sit around and wait for the good old boys to decide it's
my turn,'' she said, ``I'll be 99 and they'll say, 'Just wait one
more year.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Clay said he expects Schrenko would run only ``if all those
(other) bets are off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a team player,'' Clay said. ``She's not sitting out
there spitting and stomping, wanting to get into the race.''

U.S. ASKS TRADE ORGANIZATION FOR HELP IN MEXICAN PHONE MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just weeks before Mexico's president-elect, Vicente Fox, is
scheduled to make his first visit to Washington to discuss
commercial relations with the United States, the Clinton
administration took the first steps on Friday toward filing a
formal complaint against Mexico for failing to ensure open
competition in its $12-billion telecommunications market.
</P>
<P>
   As she had warned several times since April, Charlene
Barshefsky, the U.S. trade representative, is asking the World
Trade Organization to hold formal consultations between the United
States and Mexico on the way Mexico supervises its recently
deregulated telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
   Several American corporations, including AT&AMP;T and WorldCom, have
invested millions in Mexico since deregulation began in the
mid-1990s. They have complained for the last year that they have
been stymied by the actions of Telefonos de Mexico, the dominant
carrier, and by weak-kneed Mexican regulators who have failed to
stand up to the company, known as Telmex.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, along with Mexican partners, owns Alestra, a long-distance
company. WorldCom owns a controlling share of Avantel, another
long-distance company, also with Mexican associates.
</P>
<P>
   The trade representative accuses Telmex of several
anticompetitive actions. The United States contends that Telmex
overcharges to connect local calls to the long-distance networks,
applies unfair fees for incoming international long-distance phone
calls and denies competitors the high-traffic lines they need for
Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications regulators are accused of failing to properly
enforce deregulation commitments to which Mexico agreed in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has become a sore point in commercial relations
between the United States and Mexico, its second-largest trading
partner, giving rise to harsh statements in a field usually noted
for diplomatic restraint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the regulatory system in Mexico is entirely broken,''
Barshefsky said in a conference call with reporters on Friday
morning. She said she had little faith that Mexican officials in
the outgoing administration of President Ernesto Zedillo would keep
promises to resolve the regulatory issues before Fox is inaugurated
on Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard that song before,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, Jorge Nicolin, president of the Federal
Telecommunications Commission, said the trade representative's
complaint was ``unfounded and not substantiated.'' He said he was
confident Mexico would successfully defend its position.
</P>
<P>
   Nicolin said Mexican officials had met with American trade
officials ''three times already this year, and as we explain at
every step, it is because we have competition in Mexico that we
have these problems.''
</P>
<P>
   By Nicolin's count, 12 competing long-distance carriers operate
in Mexico, along with 7 local carriers. He acknowledged that
competitive problems existed but said formulation of new
regulations to promote competition had been delayed by legal
challenges from Telmex and other telephone companies. They should
be ready by the end of October, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Telmex spokesman, Arturo Elias Ayub, rebutted the trade
representative's argument that Telmex had actually increased its
share of the long-distance market to 81 percent from 74 percent
three years ago. ``We wish it were that high,'' he said, contending
that Telmex handled no more than 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If no settlement is reached within 60 days after the World Trade
Organization consultations begin, Barshefsky said the United States
would file a formal complaint before the WTO.

KENNEDY HOSTAGE-TAKING SEEN AS PRICE OF AVOIDING GUNFIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., Nev.)   By JOHN SULLIVAN and RANDY KENNEDY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Airport security checkpoints, with their squads of
guards and phalanxes of metal detectors, are considered by most
passengers to be a kind of firewall, designed to stop weapons from
getting anywhere near airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   But airline security officials have long acknowledged that the
checkpoints are really meant to do only part of that job: They are
supposed to detect hidden guns or bombs and provide a system for
alerting armed police officers. If someone brandishes a gun and
tries to force his way past, the officials said, the unarmed
security officers at the checkpoints are not only unable to stop
him, they are not supposed to.
</P>
<P>
   This fact was frighteningly underscored late Thursday night in
Terminal 4W at Kennedy International Airport, when Aaron Commey, a
22-year-old Milwaukee man, approached a security supervisor, waved
a 10-millimeter automatic handgun, ran around the metal detectors
and dashed directly out an elevated Jetway at Gate 33. He then
boarded a National Airlines Boeing 757 set to fly to Las Vegas and
took the pilot and co-pilot hostage.
</P>
<P>
   No one was hurt during the takeover, and officials at Kennedy
airport insisted Friday that their security procedures had worked
as they should have: Armed police officers responded in less than
three minutes, no shots were fired and hostage negotiators
succeeded in persuading Commey to give himself up.
</P>
<P>
   But to many of the passengers who were boarding the National
Airlines jet, the security system seemed to have left them
shockingly vulnerable. Unlike the security checkpoints throughout
most of the rest of the airport, the checkpoint for the National
Airlines flight was unusually close to the door to the Jetway,
meaning that there was next to no time for flight attendants to
close the door and prevent him from boarding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police came very fast, but there was no security,'' said
Marcus Weiss, one passenger interviewed shortly after the takeover
began. ``The guy just walked right on through. It's really really
strange. The airport security working there weren't armed. They
couldn't do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy airport officials and many other airline security
experts said Friday that the proximity of the checkpoint to the
gate probably had little to do with what happened, because Commey,
pointing a gun, probably could have gone through many other
checkpoints located farther from gates and still made his way onto
a plane.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials agreed Friday that the incident was exactly
the kind that, despite various strategies over the years, has long
been considered virtually unpreventable.
</P>
<P>
   For six years, beginning in 1973 after a spate of hijackings,
security screening points were set up in all the country's airports
and they were guarded by armed police officers. But in 1978, the
Federal Aviation Administration and the airline industry agreed to
discontinue the practice, in part because they considered it more
dangerous than the possibility of a gunman forcing his way through
the checkpoint area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a firing range,'' said Homer A. Boynton, who directed
security for American Airlines from 1981 to 1993. ``There was a
unanimous decision among the people in the airline industry and the
people in the FAA that it was a wise choice to take the armed guard
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Capt. John Torres, the operations captain at Kennedy airport,
said that he believed people could have been hurt if guards had
been armed or had tried to stop Commey.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a potential for a shootout in a crowded terminal with
passengers walking around,'' said Torres, one of the Port Authority
police officers who directed the response to the hostage situation
Thursday night. He added: ``Security did the right thing. They did
not try to take an individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Torres and other officials said, the security guards _
who do not work for the Port Authority but for a private company
under contract to the airlines _ pushed what is known as a covert
button as soon as Commey sprinted past the metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
   The button sounded an alarm that summoned armed Port Authority
police officers. Al Graser, deputy director of the aviation
department for the Port Authority, said that at least one officer
is stationed in each of the six terminals at Kennedy airport.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, officers once were required to respond to a
security checkpoint within one minute in an emergency, but over the
years, as the number of hijacking attempts dropped, the requirement
was relaxed to five minutes, Graser said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, Torres said, the police response time was two
to three minutes.

PARTY LOYALTY ELUSIVE IN NATION'S LAST 2 `SWING' CONGRESSIONAL

<P>
   MEDINA, Wash. _ Dan McDonald and Stewart Greenleaf, two veteran
Republican state legislators, share a special reason for confidence
in their efforts to oust Democratic incumbents from the U.S. House
of Representatives this fall.
</P>
<P>
   For they are running in the two true ``swing'' House districts
left in the United States, not districts that just look like juicy
targets to the party on the outside, but districts that regularly
switch from the control of one party to the other.
</P>
<P>
   Each of their districts _ Washington's 1st, where McDonald
challenges Rep. Jay Inslee, and Pennsylvania's 13th, where
Greenleaf runs against Rep. Joseph M. Hoeffel _ has changed hands
three times in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that swing districts were the bellwethers of
national politics, closely watched as the parties slugged it out
with issues and insults election after election. But in the 1950s
their numbers began to decline as parties receded in importance and
congressional candidates ran increasingly on their own, raising
their own money and, once they were in power, inventing dozens of
perks to help solidify incumbency.
</P>
<P>
   The vanishing swing district is one of the most telling examples
of how the nature of congressional election politics has changed.
For all the talk of a momentous battle for control of the House,
where Republicans now hold an 11-seat majority, there is real
competition in only a handful of districts _ fewer than three
dozen.
</P>
<P>
   These two genuine swing districts, 2,800 miles apart, have a lot
in common. Both are overwhelmingly white suburbs of broad lawns and
shopping malls, where most adults have been to college. Both have
above-average incomes and expensive houses. Bill Gates' $60 million
house here, and the more prevalent sports cars on Seattle's
streets, suggest that the Washington district is a little better
off than the Pennsylvania district. In both places, issues like
education, abortion and taxes are on people's minds.
</P>
<P>
   There is no simple reason why these districts in and around
Philadelphia and Seattle have remained so competitive. Other
constituencies with similar demographics and politics have settled
into the hands of one party or the other. But the biggest cause may
be the failure of the Republicans who won these seats back in the
Gingrich Revolution of 1994 to stay in touch with their voters,
hanging on in 1996 but losing in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The single biggest reason for the decline of the old-fashioned
swing district is the set of advantages the system gives
incumbents. They can overcome anything short of tidal waves in
national politics. Thomas Mann, a congressional scholar at the
Brookings Institution, cited resources ``that allow members to
present themselves in favorable light back home, everything from
being able to raise the money to run active, visible campaigns,
travel home on a regular basis with a subsidy and use their
legislative positions for commandeering the attention of the local
media.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps none of those advantages is as important as being able
to help constituents _ finding a lost Social Security check,
getting a visa for a relative to attend a wedding, arranging a
long-forgotten medal for a veteran.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage most easily proven is financial: incumbents raise
more money. This month Inslee reported a campaign cash advantage of
$955,551 to $546,891 for McDonald. Similarly, Hoeffel had $818,468
in the bank to Greenleaf's $440,334.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But those advantages are unlikely to be decisive in a campaign
year when control of the House hangs in the balance. National party
organizations and their front groups, along with special interests
of all complexions, are expected to put total spending in the 30 or
so most competitive House districts at around $5 million each.
</P>
<P>
   The edge that neither challenger can really combat was on
display on a recent Saturday at the Acme Supermarket in East
Norriton Township, Pa., where Hoeffel set up a table full of
government _ not campaign _ literature and met constituents. Some
came because of a government-paid mailing; others were just weekend
shoppers. Several wanted help with tax problems. One wanted Hoeffel
to persuade his insurance company to pay for a particular drug.
</P>
<P>
   Politics came up, too. Voters talked about gun laws and taxes on
married couples. One woman wanted to change her registration from
Republican to Democrat because Republicans tried to extend the
patent on the allergy drug Claritin.
</P>
<P>
   Inslee has been demonstrating another edge of incumbency _
publicity. In recent weeks the Seattle newspapers have reported
that he got the electronic signature bill passed by adding consumer
protections, that he was working on pipeline safety legislation
after a fatal accident at Bellingham last year, and that he was
critical of the judge in the antitrust case against Microsoft,
whose headquarters at Redmond is in his district, and whose
employees contribute heavily to Inslee.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One advantage the Democrat enjoyed two years ago is gone. In
1998, Bruce Craswell, a conservative third-party candidate, took 6
percent of the vote, just a bit more than Inslee's margin over Rep.
Rick White, the Republican incumbent. Most of the Craswell votes
came at White's expense. Without Craswell, the race would have been
about even. This time Inslee is opposed only by McDonald, a
powerful 22-year veteran of the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   On the stump, McDonald complains about Inslee's votes against
tax cuts, says he wants local school boards to have more authority
in spending federal money while giving them incentives to ease
bureaucratic teacher certification rules. And McDonald, a Vietnam
veteran, said he wanted to strengthen national defense. ``War is a
complete failure of diplomacy,'' he said. ``Diplomacy is helped by
having a sharpened sword.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, McDonald said taxes and education would be the
major differences between him and his opponent. But he also said he
had always voted to restrict abortions, an issue Inslee plans to
attack him on.
</P>
<P>
   Every candidate here advertises his credentials as an
environmentalist. McDonald and Inslee both addressed participants
in a 110-mile hike from the Cascades to Puget Sound this weekend.
The Democrat warned them of politicians ``who just talk green but
vote brown.'' In an interview, he said McDonald was one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Inslee argued that campaign finance legislation, including a ban
on unregulated contributions to parties, was essential both to
protect the environment and to protect personal privacy in an
electronic age.
</P>
<P>
   Across the continent, in the suburban district that stretches
from Philadelphia's Main Line out to Valley Forge and Abington,
Greenleaf is also a soft-spoken but powerful state legislator. He
emphasizes local school control, tax cuts and the ``flexible''
Republican drug plan, though on issues like the fear of a ``big
boondoggle'' in the anti-missile program or support for trigger
locks on handguns he emphasized his moderate credentials _
underlined by his support for abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   At a retirement home in Plymouth Meeting, Greenleaf said he had
been recognized as ``effective'' in 24 years in the state capital,
and would be the same kind of congressman.
</P>
<P>
   Hoeffel boasted of being ``socially progressive and fiscally
responsible,'' and said his budgetary bona fides had been certified
by the Concord Coalition, a bipartisan group. And he argued that
Republicans were captives of the pharmaceutical industry. He called
for ``registration of handguns and licensing of handgun owners.''
</P>
<P>
   One advantage the two Democrats share is that they have both
been through tough campaigns, winning and losing before. Neither
Republican has ever had a real test.
</P>
<P>
   Both Democrats are trying to take their districts out of the
``swing'' category. Only one other district changed hands three
times in the '90s, but that one, the 1st District in Northern
California, now seems safe for its Democratic incumbent, Rep. Mike
Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   But even if their districts turn out to be safe from this year's
Republican challengers, they may not be secure for 2002 against the
partisan vagaries of redistricting.

 &HT;    Muslim gathering in Atlanta offers support for Al-Amin
 &HT;    By Joshua B. Good
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As 250 Muslims bowed in prayer in West End Park, Black
Panthers wearing holstered handguns stood at attention around the
worshipers.
</P>
<P>
   It was an ironic contrast for the start of a three-day Riyaadah,
a national Muslim gathering that began Friday in Atlanta. Peaceful
prayer contrasted by militant men. Symbolic, perhaps, of the one
who wasn't there: Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin.
</P>
<P>
   In Al-Amin's youth, he was once a Black Panther who wore a black
beret and carried a gun. But since moving to Atlanta 20 years ago,
he has been the imam, or prayer leader, of the West End Community
Mosque. He is credited with preaching about inner peace and
cleaning up the neighborhood of drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
   And now the 57-year-old is in jail, accused of killing Fulton
County Sheriff's Deputy Ricky Kinchen and injuring another deputy
on the night of March 16.
</P>
<P>
   For 18 years, Muslims from around the country have attended the
Riyaadah to play sports, worship, eat together and catch up with
old friends. The event is held in a different city each year.
Al-Amin was the principal organizer. But for this weekend's event,
many of the participants said they came to West End because of
Al-Amin's incarceration and to show support for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe whatsoever that he committed that act. We're
gonna believe in his innocence until we're buried in our graves,''
said Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, a former Denver Nuggets basketball player
who came to Atlanta from Gulfport, Miss. for the Riyaadah.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, William Abdur-Rahim, an imam of a mosque on Hank
Aaron Drive in Atlanta, visited Al-Amin in the Fulton County jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in wonderful spirits,'' Abdur-Rahim said as he stood at a
microphone in the park. Posters displaying Al-Amin's picture hung
around the park.
</P>
<P>
   Abdur-Rahim said Al-Amin sent his thanks to the worshipers for
coming. Many said they planned to visit him in jail, following the
example of Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, who visited
Al-Amin Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   After the prayers and sermons in the park were over,
participants broke up into smaller groups. Some played basketball.
Women purchased shawls and traditional clothing from vendors.
Children ate snow cones, lined up to ride two ponies and jumped in
an inflatable room called the Moonbounce.
</P>
<P>
   Others stood together talking about the death penalty case
against Al-Amin. At first, all reports about his case looked bad
for Al-Amin's supporters. The surviving deputy identified Al-Amin
as the shooter. Tests on two guns found in some Alabama woods where
Al-Amin was arrested showed they were the ones used to shoot the
deputies.
</P>
<P>
   But then came reports of a blood trail and 911 caller who saw a
bleeding man five blocks from the shooting scene begging for a
ride. Al-Amin had not been shot, giving his supporters hope someone
else was the shooter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the criminal justice system will work for him as it has
worked for others,'' said Nihad Awad, director of the Council on
American-Islamic Relations in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   As the celebration and discussions about Al-Amin's case were
going on, Atlanta police discreetly approached the Black Panther
members and asked them to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``They respected our chain of command and we respected their
chain of command,'' said Ahkee El-Shabazz, chairman of the Bankhead
chapter of the Black Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Panthers gave up their guns.

<P>
   Candice Carpenter, who has come to epitomize the hard struggle
to establish Internet companies in New York, has relinquished the
title of chief executive of iVillage to Doug McCormick, the
company's president. Carpenter, whose move was announced on
Thursday, will remain as chairman of the board.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter, a veteran of American Express and QVC, founded
iVillage in 1995 to be an Internet site focusing on topics of
interest to women. As West Coast Internet start-ups were flooded
with venture capital, iVillage struggled to raise money, amid
skepticism both of New York as a technology center and of the idea
of an advertiser-supported Web site, which requires hundreds of
writers and producers to operate.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter was able to raise enough venture capital, and iVillage
went public in March 1999, along with a number of other New York
Internet companies. But iVillage has also been plagued by questions
regarding what employees called Carpenter's mercurial management
style.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the turnover among senior executives is much
higher than at similar companies. Most recently, Craig Monaghan,
the company's fifth chief financial officer, and Allison Abraham,
its chief operating officer, left the company. Last year, Robert
Levitan, one of the three co-founders of the company along with
Carpenter and Nancy Evans, the editor in chief, left to start
Flooz, an online gift-certificate company.
</P>
<P>
   McCormick, who was the chief executive of Lifetime, the cable
network for women, joined iVillage as the No. 2 executive in April.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter said on Friday that she had long thought that
McCormick would ultimately rise to be the chief executive, but the
change happened faster than she had originally expected.
</P>
<P>
   With his background in advertising sales, McCormick has the
skills necessary to guide iVillage through the current turbulent
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five and a half years has been a very long haul,'' Carpenter
said. ``I feel happy that we found somebody I feel confident
handing the company to.''
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter said that she would spend more time on strategy,
figuring out the company's international expansion plans, and doing
public speaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been the company's face to Wall Street, but now I want
to be the brand persona to women,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She will keep an office at the company, but she doesn't expect
to be there five days a week, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The company's financial results in the second quarter, announced
Thursday, generally pleased analysts. It lost $28.0 million, up
from a loss of $15.0 million share, a year earlier. Its revenue was
19 million, triple the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   But those gains came at a price.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a true baptism of fire,'' said McCormick of his first
months at the company. Advertising from Internet companies fell,
and the company scrambled to cut costs and increase business from
more established companies. While it has not had any layoffs,
iVillage had scaled back its hiring, planning 380 employees at year
end, down from its earlier forecast of 400, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts generally favored McCormick's ascension.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very positive for iVillage to hand over the reins to a
seasoned veteran like Doug McCormick and at the same time allow
Candice to do what she does best: play the visionary,'' said Paul
Noglows, an analyst with Chase H &AMP; Q.
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiment, however, didn't help Ivillage's stock. On Friday
its shares slipped 28 cents to close at $6.25, a 52-week low.

   SCREEN-STRIKE (Los Angeles) _ In the early days of cable, Screen
Actors Guild representatives say, actors and writers cut deals
below network rates to help the fledgling industry. Now, they say,
it's time for payback. Movie and television production are being
accelerated as Hollywood prepares for the possibility of strikes by
actors and writers when their contracts expire next year. A strike
over pay for commercials reflects the new economics of television
as cable gains, networks retreat and new options are created in
electronic media, including the Internet. By Barbara Whitaker.

   SQUIRT-INVENTOR _ Sanford Redmond, inventor of the butter pat
machine, whose food packages are in the Museum of Modern Art, has a
new innovation: a machine that creates resealable single-serving
condiment packages. Now instead of ending his career as a one-hit
wonder and resting on his $80 million in royalties, Redmond, 75, is
back in the game. By Amanda Hesser.

   INTERNET-SCHEMES (Undated) _ There's a veritable gold rush on
the Internet for get-rich-quick schemes. Con artists can set up
shop cheaply and anonymously around the world. It's difficult for
law enforcement to track, but the FTC is stepping up enforcement
efforts online. One effort this year was ``Surf Days,'' in which
150 law enforcement and consumer agencies worldwide surfed the net
and discovered 1,600 suspected sites. By Skip Kaltenheuser.

   DIAMONDS (Undated) _ DeBeers made headlines when it announced

<P>
   CARS-AUDI (Undated) _ When Audi's A8 made its debut, less than
four years ago, Audi mocked competitors by summarizing its car's
virtues as ``excellence without excess, class without mass.'' There
is still excellence and class. On a 1500-mile drive through
Northern California and Nevada, the $72,525 test car (base price,
$68,425) proved luxurious, pampering passengers with a ride that
was practically serene. By James G. Cobb.
</P>
<P>
   CARS-BOXSTER (Undated) _ The Boxster, with its swoopy futuristic
sheet metal, was slotted as an entry-level sports car. With a
$40,000-plus price tag it seemed high, but now Peter Passell is
happy to report that in the new Boxster S the price has been raised
$9,000 and the company has turned the Boxster into the sports car
he always wanted. Porsche accomplished this transformation with
more horsepower, even bigger disc brakes, beefed up suspension,
excellent ergonomics and a telescoping and tilting steering wheel.
He does have a few little gripes.

``high stakes'' Camp David peace summit meeting is that ``the

territories occurred when the talks collapsed, nor is chaos
expected any time soon. This is because not only was ``the brink''
a myth, so were the descriptions of what lay on the other side. It

   AIRCRASH-TECH-REVIEW (Washington) _ The disasters involving two
symbols of national pride _ the Concorde in 2000 and the Hindenburg
in 1937 _ are instructive about the difficulties of predicting
technological progress. It remains to be seen whether the Concorde
accident will kill the supersonic transports the way the Hindenburg
ended the promise of the dirigible, when it crashed killing 35
people on board and one on the ground. But progress _ including,

   ART-LONDON (London) _ All over London, the words ``make it new''
have been applied to museums. Through Sept. 17, the National

   TRAVEL-GOLF-NETHERLANDS (Undated) _ The Netherlands has not been

canals. The terrain in most places is famously flat, but it has a
handful of world-class courses that offer challenges and beauty. By
Robert Sidorsky.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-NETHERLANDS-LEIDEN (Undated) _ With the exception of
Amsterdam, which has a population nearly seven times that of
Leiden, no other city in the Netherlands has such a broad range of
museums and historic sites. Rembrandt was born there. In the 17th
century America's Pilgrim Fathers took refuge in Leiden before
leaving for the New World. The first tulips in Holland (originally
from Turkey) were planted in the university's botanical garden, and
imports from the New World _ tomato, potato, tobacco and corn _
were introduced into Northern Europe through Leiden. By Christopher
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-COAST-NETHERLANDS (Undated) _ Geraldine Fabrikant got
away from the crowds of Amsterdam to quaint fishing villages on the

Edam, its prosperous homes and its cheeses. In Volendam there are
boats to watch and koffie verkeerd to drink while watching the

   TRAVEL-INDIA-SPA (Undated) _ If ever there was an escape from
the heat, dust and noise of India's cities, Ananda is it. In a
$50-million renovation, Ananda's designers have grafted an
air-conditioned spa and 75-room hotel onto a maharajah's palace.
Celia W. Dugger treats readers to the details of being anointed

<P>
   IBIZIA-DISCOS (Ibizia, Spain) _ Ibizia has become a clubhopper's
destination resort. There are billboards advertising discos, a
disco bus whose drivers play techno and disco package tours. Many
come here to capitalize on the availability of party drugs like
Ecstasy and Special K, but it's the dance-driven decadence, the
perpetual parties and the carnivalesque clubs that are the main

</P>
<P>
   NITEOUT-WEBSTER (London) _ A niteout in London with Stephen
Webster, a jewelry designer, and Anastasia, his Russian-born wife.
They run into Count Andrei Tolstoy (an offshoot of the writer's
family), Jacob Dzhugashvili, an artist and great-grandson of Joseph
Stalin; Nash Tavkhelidze, godson of the former Russian Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov, and lead singer of Blast, the first
Russian band to be signed to a British label. ``What a bizarre
party,'' Webster observed.
</P>
<P>
   GOLF-FASHION (Undated) _ Alex Witchel dons a skort and

to realize that women who wear Armani are not going to the course
dressed as Emmett Kelly.

</P>
<P>
   SUITS-IRONY (Undated) _ The suit is becoming a default uniform
for the hip, but it has to be worn with a sense of irony, reports
Bob Morris. Spike Jonze, the director of ``Being John Malkovich''
is a suit guy. So is the skateboarder-turned-art dealer Aaron Rose,
and when Keanu Reeves recently played a gig here with his rock
band, Dogstar, it was in a dark suit by DKNY. Then there's Mike
Mills, who has directed videos and ads for Nike and the Gap. He
wears Brooks Brothers suits. ``People expect a hip and edgy guy to
be wearing stuff from Banana Republic, and it throws them off and
puts me in a more powerful position,'' he said. ``It's the most
punk thing I can do right now.''

 &HT;    Orkin memos say termite work falsified
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Internal memos written by Orkin Exterminating Co.
executives in Florida, Georgia and Texas indicate that company
employees falsified reinspections of homes for termite damage.
</P>
<P>
   The memos, written in April 1996, apparently after an internal
company audit, said many Orkin customers are ''being charged for
services not rendered.''
</P>
<P>
   Orkin and its parent company, Rollins Inc., are based in
Atlanta.

<P>
   In one memo, Greg Lawrence, an Orkin regional executive in
Central Florida, wrote to branch managers: ``During the past
several months there have been instances of fraud, theft, and
forgery within the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence added that ''reinspections are being falsified and
customers being charged for the service when we don't know if, in
fact, the customer ever received their reinspection.''
</P>
<P>
   The memos told Orkin branch managers to stop such practices.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa attorney Dan Clark said Friday that the memos surfaced in
connection with a lawsuit by several Tampa residents against Orkin.
</P>
<P>
   The Tampa suit, filed last year, alleges that Orkin workers
performed improper chemical treatments for termites, skipped annual
inspections, forged customer names on inspection slips and
misrepresented warranties to consumers. The Orkin customers, as a
result, suffered substantial termite damage to their homes,
according to the lawsuit, which seeks class-action status.
</P>
<P>
   Orkin faces a similar lawsuit in Alabama that has reached
class-action status. The company denies the charges in each case.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Orkin said Friday the company ''could not
comment'' on the memos.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence could not be reached for comment. An Orkin manager in
South Florida, Joe Cannariato, said he did not recall writing the
memo to his branch managers and referred questions to Orkin's home
office in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``These memos confirm what our lawsuit is all about,'' Clark
said. ``It's brought by Orkin customers in Florida who didn't get
the treatment they expected, either initially or through renewals.
In fact, the evidence we have shows that these people were
defrauded.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark said Orkin customers' signatures were forged on
re-inspection slips after 1996, when the company memos were
written.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Orkin termite-related practices are being
investigated by Florida and five other states, according to Bob
Buchner, an assistant Florida attorney general. He did not identify
the other states, though Georgia is not one of them.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida investigation is targeting Orkin advertising and
other practices, Buchner said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Central and South Florida, the memos were written
by Orkin officials to branch managers in north Texas, south Texas
and South Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Gard, then an Orkin manager in South Georgia, said in his
April 22, 1996, memo to branch managers that there ''have been
instances of fraud, theft and forgery within the company.'' Gard
continued: ``On more than one occasion, it has happened in our
region.''
</P>
<P>
   A shorter memo by an Orkin executive in Louisiana warned branch
managers to review company policy against fraud, theft and forgery.
</P>
<P>
   Former Orkin employees in Florida have said in affidavits or
depositions that employees at times forged customers' signatures on
annual reinspection forms for termite damage, when that service
wasn't actually performed.
</P>
<P>
   Former Orkin employee Fred Beman of Tampa said in a 1998
affidavit that the forgery practice ''was done at the specific
instruction of management (who benefited) through the receipt of
bonuses.''
</P>
<P>
   The memo by Lawrence also stated, ``Sales inspectors are having
customers sign customer satisfaction certificates prior to work
being completed for accommodation of paying our employees, but at
the expense of our customer who may never have received the
service.''
</P>
<P>
   Orkin is the No. 2 pest-control company in revenues behind
Terminix. It serves about 1.7 million residential and commercial
customers from more than 400 offices. Rollins Inc., the parent
company, reported 1999 revenues of $586.6 million. Its headquarters
is in Atlanta.

EARNINGS LOOK GOOD, WHICH MIGHT BE BAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 30) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some dates to remember:
</P>
<P>
   _ July 17. After a seven-week, 35 percent surge from its low for
the year, the Nasdaq composite reaches 4,274.67, its highest close
since early April.
</P>
<P>
   _ July 18. Unisys, the information technology company, says
third-quarter profits will be only about half of what analysts had
forecast.
</P>
<P>
   _ July 20. The telecommunications equipment makers Lucent
Technologies and Ericcson each warn that third-quarter earnings
will fall below expectations.
</P>
<P>
   _ July 26. Xerox, the copier company, says earnings for the
second half will fall short.
</P>
<P>
   _ July 27. WorldCom, the long-distance and wireless company,
says revenues for the remainder of the year will come in at the low
end of current forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   _ July 28. The Nasdaq is down 14.3 percent since July 17.
</P>
<P>
   So even as second-quarter earnings reports are coming in
stronger than expected, especially for technology companies,
investors seem suddenly to be focusing on the possibility of a
slowdown in earnings growth during the rest of the year. It's about
time.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of slower earnings growth has been bubbling for a while.
Quarterly forecasts by First Call/Thomson Financial and IBES
International, which collect Wall Street profit estimates for the
companies in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, have been
tailing off. But investors, intoxicated by the unbelievable
earnings growth this decade and particularly over the last year,
seemed to ignore the warnings until now.
</P>
<P>
   If you remain unconvinced, here is something to think about:
Optimism about earnings may itself be a negative sign.
</P>
<P>
   The analysts who forecast earnings are still upbeat about the
rest of the year, even with the Federal Reserve trying to slow
economic growth to curb inflation. S&AMP;P 500 operating earnings are
expected to have grown by 20.6 percent in the second quarter, to
grow 16.6 percent in the third quarter and an additional 14.5
percent in the fourth, according to IBES. First Call's forecasts
for each period are a tad higher. For the year, IBES sees 18.5
percent growth, First Call sees 19.6 percent; either way, one of
the best years since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Hill, director of research at First Call, noted that
earnings forecasts are holding up even for some economically
sensitive sectors despite higher interest rates. Companies in home
construction are expected to show a 13 percent decline in earnings
in the second quarter, compared with the period a year ago, and
then close the gap to 3 percent in the third quarter and post 6
percent growth in the fourth. Companies in the automobile sector
are expected to show 14 percent growth in the third quarter and 15
percent in the fourth quarter. These are not the numbers one would
expect, Hill said, if the economy were slowing down the way Federal
Reserve policymakers would like.
</P>
<P>
   That optimism indicates that Wall Street analysts do not expect
a significant slowdown in growth in the second half _ not
unreasonable, given that the economy has stuttered in the second
quarter of past years only to reaccelerate in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   But Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, reminded investors in
testimony to Congress last week that when policy makers meet on
Aug. 22, the decision on another interest rate hike will depend on
new economic data for July showing that the slowing trend he has
identified is continuing.
</P>
<P>
   That means one of two things: Wall Street analysts are wrong _
the economy really will slow significantly, and so will corporate
earnings, to investors' intense disappointment. Or, the analysts
are right _ the Fed's rate increases haven't worked yet and the
economy is perking up again.
</P>
<P>
   Right now the data favors the analysts, including the totally
unexpected 5.2 percent jump in second-quarter gross domestic
product reported on Friday, the increases in durable-goods orders
and existing home sales in June and the rising consumer confidence
this month.
</P>
<P>
   If the trend holds, the Fed is likely to push rates higher
still. And that won't be good for stocks. So beware. Earnings may
be bad for the stock market's health. &QL;

DEMOCRATIC SQUADS TRAIL BUSH, SPREADING MAYHEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)   By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ ``I'm looking for some Bush to whack,'' Harry
Fred Scott, retired postal worker and dedicated Democrat, growled
Friday in his East Texas drawl as he boarded the bus loaded with
boisterous Texans and emblazoned with a blue banner that read
``Don't mess with America.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive
Republican presidential nominee. And whack away he did. In
Cincinnati, he and his fellow Texans asserted that their state
lagged behind the nation in school test scores. In Dayton, they
complained about a dysfunctional health-care system. In Columbus,
they fretted about smog-filled skies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have soccer moms whose children can't play soccer'' because
of air pollution, Tamara Maschino told reporters outside a senior
center here. ``And I hold George W. Bush personally responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   From the Democratic National Committee, the people who came up
with the chicken that chased President George Bush in 1992 and the
cigarette that dogged Bob Dole in 1996, comes the party's newest
tool of disruption: the Texas Truth Squad, 14 elected officials and
citizens bearing tales of Bush-induced woe from the Lone Star
State.
</P>
<P>
   They have traveled through Kentucky and Ohio on their way to
West Virginia and Philadelphia, where the Republican National
Convention will begin on Monday. Bush and his running mate, Dick
Cheney, are expected to take the same route on their way to the
convention, and the Democrats wanted to get there first to muddy
the waters a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bushes are coming and the Bushes will get you,'' Scott
bellowed at older citizens in Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   The Truth Squad is just one cog in the Democratic machine
created to mock and contradict the Republicans during their
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the week, a team of surrogate speakers, led by the
party's chairmen, Joe Andrew and Edward G. Rendell, will hold daily
news conferences attacking the Republican ticket. The party has
bought billboard space near the convention center carrying the
message: ``I know what you did in Texas.'' A Web site loaded with
anti-Bush broadsides will go online on Sunday, at
www.iknowwhatyoudidintexas.net.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of it all, teams of researchers at the national
committee's offices in Washington and the Gore 2000 headquarters in
Nashville, Tenn., will issue floods of faxes and e-mail messages in
a minute-by-minute effort to rebut virtually everything that every
Republican says from the convention stage in Philadelphia.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The nameless and faceless researchers are the engine that drives
much of the Democratic troublemaking. In Nashville, they are known
as ``the men and women of zeal'' because they are all 20-somethings
who work 18-hour days scanning the Internet, watching television
and reading newspapers in search of stray scraps of damaging
information about their foes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call this the slaughterhouse,'' said Donna Brazile, Gore's
campaign manager, as she strolled into the team's glass-enclosed
office in Nashville recently. ``They may look like gentle people.
But they are killers.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by David Ginsberg, a pot-bellied, chain-smoking, bearded,
balding and brainy 25-year-old, the Gore researchers were often
stunningly successful in undermining the daily messages of Bill
Bradley during the Democratic primaries.
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa, they inundated reporters with information about a vote
Bradley cast against flood relief for farmers, and the issue dogged
Bradley for days. Later, when Bradley attacked Gore for supporting
the tobacco industry two decades ago, Ginsberg was ready with a
compilation of quotes from Bradley vowing to avoid negative
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the Gore team's researchers pulled repeated
all-nighters compiling thick dossiers on every potential Republican
vice presidential candidate. The one man they failed to study
closely was the one who was chosen.
</P>
<P>
   But as soon as Cheney's name surfaced last weekend, they went
into overdrive. And when Bush made his choice official Tuesday
morning, Ginsberg had already distributed a detailed analysis of
Cheney's voting record in Congress, which was so conservative that
it surprised even some Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we vetted Cheney better than Bush did,'' bragged one
adviser to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats also firmly believe that good research fuels
better pranks. When a DNC researcher learned that the Bush campaign
was buying George W. Bush bottled water that came from Kentucky,
they ordered several cases and gave it out to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is George W. Bush's message in a bottle,'' Andrew said at
a news conference in Oregon last Tuesday. ``Don't drink the water
in Texas.''

JOHN G. GOODE ON LOOKING FOR FALLEN STARS AMONG THE BROKEN EGGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (For release Sunday, July 30) 
 By CAROLE GOULD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sunmaid makes raisins from the grapes grown on the 40-acre farm
in Fowler, Calif., where John G. Goode grew up. Goode, who still
owns the farm, also runs the $2.55 billion Smith Barney Fundamental
Value fund _ and he says managing its portfolio is much like
farming.
</P>
<P>
   ``You plant the fields and hope you get a good crop,'' Goode
said from his San Francisco office, which has a view of the Golden
Gate Bridge. ``But you have to keep the field tended and spend time
cutting down the weeds.''
</P>
<P>
   His careful management has yielded a bounty for shareholders.
The fund returned 19.92 percent a year, on average, for the three
years through Thursday, compared with 7.28 percent for
large-capitalization value funds in general and 17.2 percent for
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, according to Morningstar
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Goode, 55, looks for fallen stars among companies. ``We're
picking the leading franchises when share prices are depressed for
reasons that we think are temporary,'' he said. ``We find that even
the best and brightest companies get involved in circumstances,
such as product recalls, that make shares available at extremely
attractive prices.''
</P>
<P>
   A cheap price isn't enough; he wants to see a catalyst that will
push a stock back up. ``We try to pick rubber balls,'' he said,
``not broken eggs.'' He uses two computerized screens to whittle
down the universe of roughly 10,000 publicly traded domestic
stocks: One looks for excess cash flow over the past five years,
while the other seeks high returns on the company's cost of
capital. A few hundred companies qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Goode then works with five analysts to select the 75 or so
stocks that fit the themes and trends that they believe will be
important over the next three to five years. The fund is now
dominated by the market's biggest stocks, but he expects that to
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our work suggests that smaller and mid-cap stocks will
dominate the big S&AMP;P 500 stocks in the future,'' he said. Among the
S&AMP;P 500 itself, he expects that ``the not-so-nifty 450 will be much
more attractive than the cult stocks'' near the top of the list.
</P>
<P>
   As inflation increases moderately, he is also moving toward
hard-asset stocks like natural-resource companies. In that group,
he especially likes Alcoa, one of the fund's top five holdings,
because it is an efficiently run industry leader, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He sees revived pricing power in many other old-economy stocks.
``We're seeing higher prices for landfills, office space,
electricity and natural gas,'' he said. ``It will probably be a
cyclical phenomenon, but it'll be a beauty over the next one to
three years.''
</P>
<P>
   He spends about one-quarter of his time talking to company
managers to gauge their acumen and their attitudes toward
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   His valuation formulas vary by industry group, but Goode
generally tends to buy shares when prices fall 20 to 40 percent
from their 90-day moving average. When the price jumps far above
that average or company insiders step up their selling sharply, he
starts paring his position. Over all, the fund's turnover is a low
40 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Goode regards Abbott Laboratories, the pharmaceutical company,
as ``the poor man's human genome play'' because it specializes in
drug-testing work, which will be required for new therapies
emerging from genome research. Abbott's stock price is depressed,
he said, because of concerns earlier this year that drug companies'
growth rates were slipping. He added that the company's planned
merger with Alza, the drug delivery company, ``didn't happen, and
that left a bad taste in investors' mouths.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund bought Abbott shares in January at $29.875; they now
trade at $41.50, or 20.75 times Wall Street's earnings estimate of
$2 a share for 2001. He expects Abbott's earnings to grow 13
percent a year through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, Goode bought shares of McKesson HBOC, the
drug distributor. ``We think the drug distribution business will be
very attractive going forward,'' he said. ``If you listen to Al
Gore, more of the population will be covered, and drug distribution
is one way to play that trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Wider use of generic drugs, which generate bigger profits for
distributors than name-brand drugs do, will also help McKesson, he
said, and he expects earnings to grow 15 percent a year for the
next three years. The stock looked like a bargain, he said, after
investors reacted sourly to a merger with HBO &AMP; Co. last year,
pushing down the price from $90 to less than $20 this spring.
</P>
<P>
   The fund bought shares for $20.43; they now trade at $24.4375,
or 18.79times the consensus 2001 earnings estimate of $1.30 a
share.
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite is Countrywide Credit, the mortgage origination
and servicing company. Goode called the stock an e-commerce play
because the company does one-fifth of its business over the
Internet. Interest-rate worries pushed down its stock price from
$50 in early 1999 to the mid-$20s early this year; he got in for
$24.99 a share in January. He noted investors' concern that Alan
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, ``would tighten the screws
in the economy, meaning that loan originators would be penalized as
interest rates rose.''
</P>
<P>
   But Countrywide's loan servicing business stood to benefit, he
added, because higher rates would discourage homeowners from
refinancing.
</P>
<P>
   Goode expects Countrywide's earnings to grow 15 percent a year
over three years. The stock now trades at $35.6875, or 10.1 times
the consensus earnings estimate of $3.54 a share for 2001. &QL;

TIME WARNER ATTRACTS WRONG KIND OF ATTENTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 30) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ From time to time, very smart people do things that
aren't so smart. Just ask the folks at Time Warner, who are
probably ruing their decision to play hardball with Walt Disney's
ABC television network during the May sweeps period.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner made headlines then by bouncing ABC off its cable
systems in a number of large markets. The dispute was soon
resolved, but sour memories lingered. Last week, at hearings before
the Federal Communications Commission, Disney and other big media
companies repaid Time Warner's aggressiveness by voicing objections
to its huge pending merger with America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Burnett, president of Merger Insight, a New York-based
institutional research service, offered some thoughts last week on
the huge deal and its prospects. Here are excerpts.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How much damage did Time Warner inflict on itself through the
spat with Disney?
</P>
<P>
   A. The odds that regulators would take a very serious look at
the AOL deal went up because of what happened in May. That event
lit a fire under Congress, which is bad. And it forced the FCC to
recognize that whoever controls the cable network controls access
to the customer. Time Warner's decision to deny Disney access
graphically demonstrated how important it is to put mechanisms in
place that will give competing content suppliers access. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. To ensure that that happens, Disney and NBC want the FCC to
make Time Warner separate its cable systems from its content
business before it approves the AOL deal. Is that likely? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Forcing a spinoff would be a deal killer, but we don't see
any need for that draconian a measure. Still, rules may have to be
put in place to ensure that networks and other competing content
suppliers are not blocked from access.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to do that is with FCC rule-making. You don't want
these rules to be written by local cable franchise authorities. You
want them written and enforced on a national level, so you get
consistency. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What else might the F.C.C. mandate that could scuttle the
deal? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Restrictions that prevent cross-selling opportunities is a
possible problem _ preventing Time Warner from sending an e-mail to
all AOL subscribers offering them a discounted subscription to
Sports Illustrated for example.
</P>
<P>
   Q. When the deal was announced in January, it was wildly
applauded, but since then opinion seems to have soured. What
happened?
</P>
<P>
   A. AOL's stock is definitely down. But companies like
Amazon.com, eBay and Yahoo are down, too, and we have had a huge
overall correction in Nasdaq stock prices. It could also be that
the market is having trouble dealing with the concept of this
merger. It is not a complete numbers game, like a merger between
two energy companies. You are dealing with concepts like pushing
magazines out through the Internet, areas where we don't have a lot
of experience.
</P>
<P>
   Q. The FCC has had the deal under review for months; the Federal
Trade Commission and the European Union are also looking at it.
When can decisions be expected? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We had been told it would close by the end of the year, but
processing it could take longer than we thought. Technically, the
FCC has only about 75 days left to make its decision, but it can
delay that by asking for more information. The European timetable
is mid-October, but Time Warner's decision to form a music joint
venture with EMI Group has run into opposition, so there could be
further delays.
</P>
<P>
   But the out date for the merger agreement is not until May 31,
2001. That means the companies left themselves plenty of time.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is it likely that Congress is going to take a whack at the
deal as well? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We expect there will be hearings sometime this fall, and a
little bit of criticism of Gerald Levin, Time Warner's chairman,
about the Disney matter. But we don't expect to see any
legislation. Normally, one merger will not prompt Congress to pass
a bill. But Congressional scrutiny does put pressure on the FCC and
the FTC to conduct a more thorough review. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is your attitude about the combination, if it is
approved? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. On balance, we don't love the transaction or hate it.
</P>
<P>
   But we haven't seen a lot of clients jump into either of these
stocks. We have people who are watching it carefully, but not many
who want to get involved in the combined company.
</P>
<P>
   That said, we have seen a lot of AOL holders sell out since the
deal was announced, because they thought the new company would be a
big, boring 5 percent revenue grower. Those clients will probably
pile back in to AOL if the deal is blocked by regulators. &QL;

`PERFECT STORM' AUTHOR'S NEW PITCH: OLD-TIME WRITER'S BAR IN A
MODERN GOTHAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 30)  
 By DOUGLAS CENTURY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
  NEW YORK _ It was opening night at the Half King on West 23rd
Street, and though the bar was still half finished, fragrant with
damp paint and sawdust, it was at full capacity with a crowd of
authors, magazine journalists, literary agents and editors.
Sebastian Junger, the best-selling author of ``The Perfect Storm,''
and one of the Half King's owners, was behind the bar in a black
blazer and open-necked shirt, unshaven, cupping a Camel Light to
his mouth. Scott Anderson, his fellow journalist-turned-barkeeper,
worked the beer taps, topping off some foamy pints.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Half King _ named after an Indian chief who played the
French and British against each other during the Revolutionary
period _ was dreamed up as a saloon for writers, which is notable
at a time when New York is awash with velvet-roped night spots;
watering holes for literary types have virtually dried up. It's a
romantic vision, a smoke-filled room where writers can drown their
sorrows after deadline. And on opening night, it all looked as
perfect as a movie set, down to the Hollywood producer's stretch
limousine left idling outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time since we've seen writers open up a bar
in New York,'' said Chris Calhoun, an agent with Sterling Lord
Literistic, squeezing in at the mahogany bar-rail for a vodka.
``The last one I can remember was Sidney Zion with Broadway Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   That was decades ago, of course, when newspapermen still wore
fedoras and had ink-stained fingertips. The Half King has been
billed as a throwback to the old-school haunt, where a scribbler
flashed a press pass and was given a tab. In those days, a
journalist's hangout was a scruffy, workingman's joint where an
errant glance or a bumped shoulder might quickly lead to a
fisticuffs. Today, you're likely to be rubbing shoulders with a
cell phone-toting DreamWorks executive looking to snap up your life
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott and I are journalists, true, but our other two partners
are in film,'' Junger said, referring to Nanette Burstein, the
director of the Academy Award-nominated documentary, ``On the
Ropes,'' and Jerome O'Connor, the Irish-born producer of the
forthcoming Barry Levinson comedy, ``An Everlasting Piece.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Half King opened, the place had a movie business
buzz, and not just because the film version of Junger's book,
starring George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg, was flexing its box
office muscle across the country. Earlier this month, Junger,
Anderson and another journalist friend, John Falk (who doubles as
the Half King's bartender), parlayed one of their recent
misadventures in Sarajevo into a pitch meeting and a
high-six-figure movie option. The story goes that while on vacation
in Bosnia _ who vacations in Bosnia? _ the three journalists found
themselves mistaken for CIA operatives, and an adventure caper
straight out of ``The Third Man'' ensued. Now, they're
collaborating on the script for Intermedia, with O'Connor set to
produce.
</P>
<P>
   Junger, who struggled for years as an underpaid freelancer
before hitting it big with ``The Perfect Storm,'' said that his bar
was inspired by the grittier demands of his job. It was while he
was working as a foreign correspondent recently with Anderson that
they dreamt up the bar venture. ``When you're working abroad,
there's always these bars that journalists end up hanging out in,
particularly in war zones,'' Junger said. ``OK, so this isn't a hot
spot, it's New York, but we're still hoping the word gets around
with visiting journalists and with local journalists, and they'll
just keep checking in.''
</P>
<P>
   The following evening, Junger's new bar was decidedly not a hot
spot. With the mob now vanished, the Half King looked like just
another sleepy neighborhood pub starved for business on a dead
Friday night. The owners outnumbered the paying customers 2 to 1.
``Nobody really knows we're open yet,'' O'Connor muttered in his
thick County Cork accent. ``And anybody that does know we're open
is still hung over from last night.''
</P>
<P>
   He took a journalist on a tour of the bar's hardscrabble past,
down to the unfinished basement, where, the story goes, the
gangland boss Waxey Gordon once ran a gambling operation. ``Right
there, on that spot, is where they played poker,'' O'Connor said,
ducking his head under a whitewashed archway that seemed
specifically designed to accommodate the frames of 5-foot-6-inch
mobsters. ``Now, this room is going to be our movie production
office.''
</P>
<P>
   The owners want to wrest the writer's social scene away from
effete intellectualism (say, an exclusive uptown soiree to honor
Martin Amis), and give it back a more rugged, Hemingwayesque sex
appeal. There's little doubt that the bar's main attraction _ from
the feminine perspective, at least _ will be the prospect of a
chance encounter with Junger, who has become nearly as famous for
his square-jaw book jacket pose as for his disaster-at-sea prose.
At the opening night party, several women turned doe-eyed whenever
Junger passed their way with pints of beer.
</P>
<P>
   But if fans of Junger's writing head to the Half King expecting
to see a recreation of the Crow's Nest, the bare-knuckled fishing
bar depicted in ``The Perfect Storm,'' they'll be disappointed.
What they'll find is a slightly upscale version of a rustic
neighborhood tavern, with apricot-colored walls, a cluster of black
leather sofas and a peaceful, shaded back garden.
</P>
<P>
   Burstein, who is Anderson's girlfriend, said that all the
partners had contributed to picking out the bar's decor _ she
herself had found the antique window frames in a demolished Harlem
warehouse _ and it amused her when advance reports kept describing
the Half King as some kind of macho clubhouse and tough-guy haven.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just because they haven't seen us in our pink frilly
dresses,'' Anderson said to Junger.

EPITAPH FOR A RULE THAT'S NOT QUITE DEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 30)  
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It sounded like an epitaph for a venerated principle of
economics, one that the Federal Reserve still invokes as a
justification for slowing the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The epitaph, in fact, came from Alan Greenspan himself in his
latest Congressional testimony. The principle he declared
inoperative maintains that full employment and low inflation are
incompatible. That may once have been true, but the old connections
are not evident now. Greenspan's epitaph makes the Fed's next
interest rate increase harder to justify.
</P>
<P>
   The principle in question, known by the acronym Nairu, holds
that when the unemployment rate falls below a certain level,
inflation accelerates. A goal in slowing the economy is to increase
unemployment _ to push it up to its ``natural'' level, at which the
inflation rate neither rises nor falls. Equilibrium is a holy grail
in mainstream economics.
</P>
<P>
   Raising unemployment is not a pretty thing to do, particularly
if people are being asked, or forced, to sacrifice their jobs in
the name of a malfunctioning thesis. Greenspan had been publicly
skeptical for months about Nairu, but in reply to a question from
Sen. Connie Mack, the Florida Republican _ ``Do we need to move the
unemployment rate back higher than 4 percent to achieve price
stability?'' _ the Fed chairman seemed to push Nairu into the
bygone.
</P>
<P>
   ``My forecast,'' he said, ``is that Nairu, which served as a
very useful statistical procedure to evaluate how the economy was
behaving, over a number of years, like so many types of temporary
models which worked, is probably going to fail in the years ahead
as a useful indicator.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearing this, Sen. Paul Sarbanes, the Maryland Democrat, asked
sarcastically if Greenspan's fellow policy makers at the Fed would
see a transcript of the chairman's epitaph. That was a jab at
Lawrence H. Meyer, an influential Fed governor who openly embraces
Nairu, which he puts at 5 to 5.25 percent. The Fed has already
raised interest rates six times in the last 14 months to slow the
economy, but Meyer would slow it more if unemployment fails to
climb from its present level of 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's epitaph is disingenuous. While burying Nairu, he
embraces almost the same principle in a different incarnation. He
speaks of running out of enough people to take jobs. Labor
shortages would then give workers leverage to bargain for higher
wages. Companies would raise prices to pay for the higher wages.
Or, as Greenspan told Congress, ``labor costs eventually would have
to accelerate to levels threatening price stability.''
</P>
<P>
   That is Nairu, or lip service to Meyer's insistence that Nairu
lives. For Greenspan, though, the natural unemployment rate appears
to be 4 percent or less. The difference between Greenspan and Meyer
is an additional 1.4 million people out of work, maybe more. For
them, the debate over Nairu matters.
</P>
<P>
   Nairu is really a description, through equations, of a set of
conditions in America that link unemployment to inflation. Those
conditions seemed a lot clearer in 1967, when Milton Friedman, the
Nobel laureate, first described a natural rate of unemployment and
mentioned the numerous factors, even states of mind, that must be
``embedded'' in the equations. In the '50s and '60s, the math
worked.
</P>
<P>
   A low unemployment rate signaled a robust demand for goods and
services. Encouraged by this, the United Auto Workers, for example,
negotiated a wage increase with General Motors, and that increase
became a pattern for other auto workers and for millions of
employees in many industries. Employers, as a matter of course,
raised prices to help pay for the higher wages. Demand made the
price increases stick; today's flood of quick-to-discount
competitors was not yet on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, demand has been similarly robust, but price
increases no longer stick very well. Wages have risen in response
to low unemployment, but not very much. The old Nairu links from
unemployment through wages to inflation have not kicked in. All
sorts of reasons are cited: rising productivity, falling computer
prices, less expensive imports, low-wage immigrants, weak unions,
corporate mobility, job insecurity. The list goes on, and the
natural rate of unemployment, set at 6.5 percent in the 1980's, has
declined today to 5 percent or less.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe there is no natural rate above zero. Maybe Nairu no
longer works. Certainly Greenspan's disavowal makes it harder for
the Fed to invoke tight labor markets as a reason to slow the
economy in anticipation of rising inflation. Now more than ever,
the Fed is under pressure to wait for inflation to actually
accelerate before it acts. &QL;

THE MAN BEHIND THE BUTTER PAT MOVES ON TO MAYO

 (For release Sunday, July 30)  
 By AMANDA HESSER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sanford Redmond was peering in at his latest
invention, a machine that cranks out small plastic containers, more
than a thousand every minute. It was clapping, stamping and
swooshing with a roar that could make a dog hide under a bed. But
Redmond looked on with the placid expression of a man admiring his
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond, now 75, is best known for designing the machine that
automated the production and packaging of butter pats _ those thin
squares of butter sandwiched between two pieces of paper that can
be found in diners and cafeterias.
</P>
<P>
   That was 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Now, instead of ending his career as a one-hit wonder and
resting on his royalties, Redmond is back in the game with a whole
new line of condiment packaging and is negotiating with Mitsubishi
International for a joint venture in the United States to license
patents for the packaging worldwide. If the deal goes through, the
packaging, inexpensive and extremely light in weight, could take
hold at a time when pressure is growing on American manufacturers
to reduce waste. Just this month, he received an American patent
for some of the packages.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Mitsubishi bought patent rights to another
package, called the dispenSRpak, designed by Redmond. The plastic
pack looks like two plastic cream dispensers joined on one edge. To
open the pack, you fold at the seam until it snaps, then squeeze
out the contents. It can all be done with one hand without any
squirting or mess. Redmond won the DuPont packaging award, a
leading prize in the industry, for the design in 1986 and a place
in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art.
Mitsubishi, which fills the packs with ketchup, mayonnaise, soy
sauce and soft chocolate, now produces 250 million of them for
Japan each year. Other companies produce them throughout Asia and
in Australia and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond's latest inventions are a new generation of this
package, called the dispenSRpak II, as well as a number of other
packages _ some for condiments, some for medicines.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of one successful machine would be a great
accomplishment for any inventor. But with Redmond, a small man who
at an interview wore a brown herringbone vest buttoned at every
hole and a white dress shirt rolled up at the sleeves, you get the
feeling that he would have invented many more had he not been held
back.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond invented his first machine, a high-speed wrapping
machine for frozen foods, when he was still in his teens. While in
the Army during World War II, he worked on a team designing a
high-speed camera for use in the nuclear development project at Los
Alamos, N.M. After the war, he moved back to New York City to work
for his father, who owned Dexter Bishop Inc., a wholesale
restaurant food supply business. The company packaged butter pats
for restaurants and institutions.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, butter pats were arranged in rows on large pieces
of greaseproof paper, then folded and sold by the pound.
Restaurants would then unfold the paper and transfer the pats one
by one onto paper cards.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, Redmond reconfigured the machine to put the pats on
small squares of paperboard, cover them with greaseproof paper and
stack them so that they could be sold in packs. His machine, which
saved time and money for restaurants, airlines, hotels and other
customers, was an instant hit.
</P>
<P>
   But trouble began just as Redmond started work on designing a
machine that would load the stacks onto trays. Redmond's father
sued him, contending waste of money and mismanagement. The case
dragged on for 11 years, ending in a settlement. In the meantime,
his royalties from his butter pat machine patent grew to $80
million.
</P>
<P>
   After his father died in 1982, Redmond created the dispenSRpak,
but running the family business would often distract him from
pursuing other inventions. He gradually downsized the business from
50 to 6. ``I want to get out of running a business,'' he said.
``I'm lousy at it.''
</P>
<P>
   His company, Sanford Redmond Inc., created after his settlement,
has remained in a rundown building in the Mott Haven neighborhood
in the South Bronx. Its large machine shop, with just two workers,
feels like a graveyard. The fields of offices are empty. Redmond
and his relentless flurry of ideas are its pulse, however faint.
</P>
<P>
   His new packaging designs are promising: they are much less
expensive to produce than current designs and use much less
plastic. ``The way to help the environment is not to recycle,'' he
said. ``It is to use less plastic.''
</P>
<P>
   That is also the general philosophy of environmental groups.
``In a case like food packaging, especially condiment packaging,''
said Richard Denison, a senior scientist at Environmental Defense,
an advocacy group in Washington, ``using the least amount of
materials is really the optimal approach.'' Chances for recycling
are minimal for most condiment packages, each of which is used just
once, usually outside the home.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond's designs are also timely, as a European trend toward
reducing packaging waste is picking up speed in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   His dispenSRpak II, for instance, uses much less plastic than
his original and costs less than one-third as much to produce. Then
there are the cream dispensers. Current varieties have
aluminum-coated paper tops; Redmond was unhappy with the way the
liquid squirts upon opening them and then spills over when set
down. To use his version, you just snap the corner of the lid, then
squeeze the desired amount through a valve. When you stop, it
doesn't drip. Even if you shake it, no liquid spills out. A similar
design, with a slightly larger valve can be used for jellies, jams,
even liquid laundry detergent.
</P>
<P>
   He has also come up with a new ketchup packet with a snap in the
corner instead of a tear line. If you don't use all the ketchup,
you can reseal the snap.
</P>
<P>
   ``His packages are very innovative and very interesting,'' not
only for the design, but for the cost saving potential, said Koji
Goto, the manager of the paper and packaging department of
Mitsubishi For now, the likelihood of a lone inventor joining
forces with this corporate giant is uncertain. If Redmond fails, he
plans to build the machines himself and try to sell them. Or _ he
winced at the thought _ retire to his home in Connecticut and
collect royalties on the butter pat machine, which he says amount
to roughly $2 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting behind his desk, leaning back in his tattered orange
leather chair with his arms crossed above his head, it was easy to
see that this is not what he wants. His grandfather was an
inventor, too. He loves machines _ large, complex machines _ and
would not settle for tinkering with gadgets at home. He is much
more concerned about creating machines than in what they produce.
He doesn't even eat butter.

CLINTON, ON ISRAELI TV, PROMISES REWARDS FOR PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN KIFNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Acting to help shore up Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
shaky political base, President Clinton went on Israeli television
Friday night promising concrete rewards for peace, hinting that he
was ready to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   That move would be a major triumph for Israel and Jews around
the world who have long sought international recognition for
Jerusalem as the capital of the Jewish state. The United States and
most other nations have kept their embassies in Tel Aviv, on the
argument that the status of the Holy City remains unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper Haaretz reported that Barak, who lost his majority
in Parliament when three parties bolted his coalition to protest
the talks and who faces no-confidence votes on Monday, had
telephoned the White House and asked the president's help with his
political problems.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed for half an hour on Israeli television, Clinton
himself introduced the issue of moving the embassy while answering
a question about the relationship between United States and Israel,
calling it ``very strong.''
</P>
<P>
   After talking about a long-term commitment to help modernize the
Israeli army and provide more security assistance now that Israeli
troops have been withdrawn from Lebanon, the president said:
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I have always wanted to move our embassy to West
Jerusalem. We have a designated site there. I have not done so
because I didn't want to do anything to undermine our ability to
help broker a secure and fair and lasting peace for Israelis and
for Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in light of what has happened, I've taken that decision
under review and I'll make a decision sometime between now and the
end of the year on that.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As he did in the immediately after Camp David, Clinton spoke
highly of Barak and his efforts at the talks, insisting that the
prime minister ``in no way ever compromised the vital interests of
the state of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the interview was pegged to the Camp David talks and
Barak's political needs, the issues of Jerusalem and U.S. support
for Israel have also featured strongly in the Senate campaign of
Clinton's wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, especially since she was
accused of once making an anti-Semitic slur. Mrs. Clinton has
declared that Jerusalem should be ``the eternal and indivisible
capital of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Once Clinton broached the subject, the Israeli interviewer
asked: ``You mentioned the relocation of the Israeli _ of the
American Embassy and put it in Jerusalem. Would you consider it in
any circumstances, even if there is no agreement?''
</P>
<P>
   The president replied ``Well, I think I should stand on the
words I said.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always wanted to do it,'' he continued. ``I've always
thought it was the right thing to do. But I didn't want to do
anything to undermine the peace process, our ability to be an
honest broker, which requires that we be accepted by both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's something I've taken under review now because of the
recent events,'' he said. ``And I think that's all I should say
about it now.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate official reaction here because the
interview was broadcast on the 8 p.m. news, after sirens had
sounded the start of the Jewish sabbath, during with the country
largely shuts down.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what Israel could expect to get if it signed a peace
agreement, Clinton replied: ``I will do my best to get the maximum
amount of support. One of the reasons that I wanted very much to
get the agreement this time is that it would give us more time to
pass an aid package through Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to mention an issue often raised by Israelis whenever
the question of compensating Palestinian refugees arises _ that of
also paying compensation to Jews who fled or were evicted from Arab
lands since the creation of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some interest, interestingly enough on both sides, in
also having a fund which compensates the Israelis who were made
refugees by the war which occurred after the birth of Israel,'' he
said. ``Israel is full of people, Jewish people, who lived in
predominantly Arab countries who came to Israel because they were
made refugees in their own land.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's another piece of the good news that I think I can
reveal that came out of the summit,'' he said. ``The Palestinians
thought those people should be eligible for compensation as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said there would have to be an ``international fund''
for the refugees, but he did not indicate who would be expected to
contribute.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the idea of such compensation was likely to be of especial
interest to Jews from Arab countries, whose support is crucial to
Barak. Many of them are supporters of Shas, a religious party with
17 seats in Parliament that broke from Barak's coalition just
before the talks began.
</P>
<P>
   The return of Shas, whose central interest is to protect and
expand the government benefits it has accumulated, would be of
major help to Barak in his efforts to regain a comfortable majority
in Parliament. Its withdrawal from the coalition, along with that
of two smaller parties, dropped Barak's support in the 120-seat
legislature from 69 to 42.
</P>
<P>
   Though generally conservative, Shas has been moderate on issues
of peace, and its spiritual leader, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, has issued
a ruling that it would be acceptable to have a Palestinian flag fly
over the Temple Mount in Jerusalem's Old City if the effect was to
save Jewish lives. Giving the Palestinians control over the mount
was one of the possible arrangements reportedly discussed at Camp
David.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's immediate goal is to survive the no-confidence votes on
Monday, after which Parliament adjourns for a three-month vacation.
</P>
<P>
   There was political speculation Friday over Foreign Minister
David Levy, who met with hunger strikers protesting the peace talks
and who met today with Ariel Sharon, the head of the right-wing
Likud party. If Levy takes his three-member Gesher faction out of
Barak's One Israel party and back into Likud, it would reduce One
Israel to 23 seats and raise Likud to 22.

   GOP-CONVENTION (Washington) _ The Republican National
Convention, which begins Monday in Philadelphia, will be a big,
boisterous affair, expensive, tightly scripted, colorful and
occasionally dramatic. But is it important? Will it mean something
in the great democratic process? Or will it be a relic from another
era, an excuse for delegates to take a nice trip, to party and get
free political memorabilia?

<P>
   SPRINGDALE, Ark. _ Brimming with confidence, Gov. George W. Bush
flew into President Clinton's home territory Friday, proclaiming
that he intended to contest areas that the Democrats won solidly in
the last two presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   With his stop in the rolling green farm country in the Northwest
corner of Arkansas, Bush began a five-day march to the Republican
National Convention that will take him through the battleground
states of Missouri, Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   In the district where a young Bill Clinton lost a race for
Congress at the age of 28, Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney,
were greeted by a roaring crowd packed into a high school
auditorium and chanting a football fight cheer. Dozens of children
were arrayed on the stage behind them and a banner proclaimed,
``Renewing America's Purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush pointed to two local boys-made-good _ Sen. Tim Hutchinson
and his brother, Asa, the congressman who gained renown as one of
the impeachment managers who prosecuted Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``They whispered something in my ear that made Dick Cheney and I
feel really great,'' Bush said. ``They told us we're going to carry
Arkansas next fall. They told us not to worry about the last two
election cycles. Something else is taking place in this state.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It buoys my heart,'' he told the cheering crowd. ``It buoys my
spirit to know as we're working our way to Philadelphia for the
national convention, and we're working our way across battleground
states that the Republican ticket has not been able to carry for
the last two elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Cheney took turns taking shots at the integrity and
trustworthiness of the president who was impeached, but later
acquitted for his efforts to cover up his affair with Monica
Lewinsky. Neither man mentioned impeachment directly or even
Clinton's name, but again and again again they harked back to the
Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said he and his running mate were ``on a great crusade to
restore dignity and integrity to Washington.'' And as the crowd
cheered, he called Bush ``the man who is going to give our kids and
our grandkids a government we once again can be proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush praised Cheney in turn, and in the process took a shot at
Clinton for his effort to sidestep questions about Lewinsky. ``This
man is a good man,'' Bush said of Cheney. ``He's a solid man. He's
a man who understands what the definition of is is.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point out in the audience, someone thundered, ``No more
Slick Willie.''
</P>
<P>
   As he began his swing into the Republican convention, Bush had
some good news _ two new polls showing him in the lead. Even in
Arkansas, a Mason-Dixon poll just last week showed Bush leading
Vice President Al Gore, 46-40 percent. It had a 4-point margin of
error.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats kept up their assault on Bush and Cheney as the
``big oil dream ticket,'' and circulated a Reuters report from 1999
saying that Cheney, the chief executive officer of the Halliburton
Co., a worldwide oil services firm, had praised an OPEC decision to
cut oil production.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, Bush's spokeswoman, said that Cheney had been
speaking at a conference of industry analysts and telling them of
projections by economists that OPEC would cut production and that
the ``price situation'' for the industry would improve. ``Unlike
the Clinton-Gore administration, he was not caught napping about
OPEC's actions,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment he came aboard his campaign plane Friday
morning, with his wife, Laura, Bush seemed relaxed and in good
spirits. He ambled down the aisle joking with reporters and
anticipating his nomination speech next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really looking forward to this speech,'' Bush said. ``This
is going to be an unbelievably interesting moment in my life _ to
walk out on that stage and to speak from my heart for however long
it takes to get through the speech.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign has worked hard to plan a feel-good Republican
convention with none of the sharp conservative edges of the past.
The evening proceedings will have star turns for nonpoliticians _ a
single mother, a teacher, a union member, a grandmother and
granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday and Tuesday nights, Bush will be beamed by satellite
into the convention from locales round the country. He is to arrive
in Philadelphia on Wednesday morning at a Latin American music
festival, symbolic of Republican efforts to reach out to Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   And on Thursday night, one of the speakers welcoming him will be
a Democrat, Jan Bullock, the wife of the late Lt. Gov. Ray Bullock
of Texas, a Democrat who worked closely with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Even Friday on what was supposed to be a partisan tour, Bush
tried to soften the tone. Before his rally he toured the Jones
Center for Families, a community center founded by a family that
ran one of the nation's largest trucking businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to hear and see and feel first hand the acts of
this particular platoon in the armies of compassion,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   As he took a quick tour of the center's computer center, one of
the first people to greet him was Charles A. Huffer, who tightly
gripped the governor's hand and began speaking. Bush looked
bewildered and and brushed him off quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that I thought he had a good chance to be
president,'' Huffer, 61, said later, ``and I asked him if he would
be willing to finally tell the American people the truth about
unidentified flying objects.''

VIETNAMESE STOCK MARKET OPENS WITH FALTERING STEP 
</HEADLINE>
   By WAYNE ARNOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam _ With just two stocks, two hours and
$5,000 in trades, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam opened its
first stock market for business on Friday and took faltering steps
into the uncertain world of free markets.
</P>
<P>
   Hopeful investors packed into the three brokerage offices taking
orders for the shares Friday morning to watch the market's birth on
electronic boards. But curiosity and excitement quickly turned into
confusion and disappointment, when minutes before the Ho Chi Minh
City Securities Trading Center opened, the government imposed a
ceiling on bids that invalidated many orders, some of which were
more than 50 percent above the government's artificially imposed
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers were so scarce at those prices that by the end of the
session, only 4,200 shares of the two stocks had been traded, with
a combined value of 70.4 million Vietnamese dong, or nearly $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Market officials nevertheless declared the day a success,
pointing to the interest among investors and justifying their price
intervention as necessary to protect novices from what otherwise
might have been dot-com-like share prices. ``In the initial stages,
the psychology of the market isn't stable,'' said Vu Bang, the
director of the trading center.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign residents here called the opening of the market an
important moment in Vietnam's development. ``The immediate point is
symbolic,'' said Dominic Scriven, an expatriate businessman who has
been investing in Vietnamese companies for nine years. ``The
government now acknowledges the right of private ownership, the
transfer of ownership, the right to make money.''
</P>
<P>
   Many hope that market trading will lure back some of the
billions of dollars that Vietnamese have squirreled away _ out of
government view _ and make that available for corporate expansion.
``The market might shake loose money from under mattresses,'' said
Jonathan Waugh, chief representative in Vietnam for Jardine Fleming
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   But they will first need to rekindle the confidence of Friday's
disappointed investors. ``My order has just been destroyed,'' said
Tran Van Thang, a 20-year-old finance student who had signed up to
buy 100 shares of each traded stock, the Refrigeration Electrical
Engineering Co. and the Cables and Telecommunications Material
Joint Stock Co., but at prices well above the government's maximum.
Like many on Friday, Thang came less to profit than to learn what
trading stocks was all about. ``We don't have any books for this,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam has been promising since 1992 to open a stock market,
which foreign investors here say is another illustration of the
communist country's halting progress toward joining the modern
global economy. China and Russia opened stock markets more than a
decade ago. Officials here explain that they were busy planning.
</P>
<P>
   In their efforts to get it right, the Vietnamese borrowed
expertise from Thailand and modeled the exchange on South Korea's
and a more famous one on Wall Street, and the exchange's deputy
director, Tran Dac Sinh, visited the New York Stock Exchange last
year.
</P>
<P>
   It is a long way from Wall Street. Outside, women in conical
hats sell birds, and boys play soccer barefoot in the street.
Officials will not even call it a stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
   But more business is on the way. Two additional stocks should be
listed in the next two weeks, Bang, the trading center's director,
said. Fifty other companies meet Vietnam's criteria for a listing,
and there are more than 400 formerly state-owned enterprises that
have been privatized since 1993. Nearly 6,000 remain in government
hands.
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnamese are avid gamblers, and in the absence of an
official market, company shares have been trading on the gray
market for years. ``This isn't a market,'' complained one such
trader, Le Hung, as he clutched a bag full of unlisted shares that
he hoped to sell. ``The government is intervening.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be some time before Saigon, as this city is still known
here, produces its own bulls and bears. Vietnam's market has an
index, but shares are traded only three days a week. Prices can
rise or fall by a maximum of 5 percent a session, and on Friday
they rose 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the desire is there. ``I heard that in the U.S. you can buy
stocks on the Web,'' said Trung Thi Han, as she watched the tote
board, waiting to learn whether her order had been executed. ``I
wish we could do that here.''

METS ACQUIRE BORDICK AS THE TRADING FRENZY BEGINS 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One week after agreeing to deal the organization's
top prospect for the All-Star shortstop Barry Larkin, the Mets
Friday traded for another All-Star shortstop, a right-handed set-up
reliever and a power-hitting outfielder _ without giving up any of
their best minor leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   When Larkin rejected the Mets' trade and stayed with the
Cincinnati Reds, the Mets focused on acquiring Mike Bordick from
Baltimore. They got Bordick Friday, then traded for reliever Rick
White and outfielder Bubba Trammell from the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles had insisted that the Double-A outfielder Alex
Escobar be included in their deal, as he was for Larkin. The Mets
refused, and general manager Steve Phillips thought there would be
no Bordick trade.
</P>
<P>
   But the Orioles finally backed off Escobar, and late Thursday
night they accepted a four-player package that included the player
Bordick will replace at short, Melvin Mora, plus infielder Mike
Kinkade and two minor league pitchers, Lesli Brea and Pat Gorman.
The Orioles showed no interest in taking on the expensive contract
of the Mets' injured shortstop, Rey Ordonez.
</P>
<P>
   After trading for Bordick and realizing he could not meet the
Milwaukee Brewers' demands for closer Bob Wickman _ who was dealt
to Cleveland Friday for a package fronted by the slugging
outfielder Richie Sexson _ Phillips turned to the Devil Rays. To
get Trammell and White, the Mets dealt outfielder Jason Tyner and
the Triple-A starter Paul Wilson, both former No. 1 draft picks.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, while the Mets landed neither of the players
they most wanted _ Larkin and Wickman _ they filled several holes
while keeping Escobar, the minor league pitchers Grant Roberts and
Pat Strange and the minor league outfielder Brian Cole, probably
the four best prospects in the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like we've protected the top echelon of our prospect
pool, hopefully to play for us but also for consideration for other
big deals that could be out there now and this off-season,''
Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   In Bordick, the Mets get an outstanding defensive shortstop who
is also enjoying his finest season at the plate. Bordick is batting
.297 with 16 home runs and 59 runs batted in, and he has a .979
fielding percentage. Mora, playing regularly for the first time in
the majors, had a .958 fielding percentage at short.
</P>
<P>
   Bordick played seven years for Oakland before signing with
Baltimore before the 1997 season. St. Louis Cardinals manager Tony
LaRussa, who managed Bordick with the Athletics, said Bordick is
``tied for first on the list'' of his favorite players.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a 10,'' LaRussa said. ``He might be the perfect player,
and he's a perfect person. He's ideal. You can't look at anything
he does and say, `I wish he did that differently.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He plays as well defensively as anyone in the big leagues. Day
in and day out, he's very consistent. He makes all the plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Bordick can be a free agent after the season, and the Mets _ who
covet another free-agent shortstop, Seattle's Alex Rodriguez _ do
not plan to talk about a contract extension with him now.
</P>
<P>
   Bordick had hoped to remain with the Orioles, but said he was
excited to be in a pennant race. He said he strives for consistency
and has proven it in his career, making between seven and 16 errors
in each of his 10 full major league seasons, with a career fielding
percentage of .981.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very confident in Melvin Mora, personally,'' said Mets
manager Bobby Valentine. ``That doesn't mean he was going to make
all the plays Bordick's going to make. I think Mike will make more
plays than Melvin would have made.''
</P>
<P>
   It is still possible that the Mets could make more moves before
Monday's nonwaiver trading deadline, but Phillips said he would be
satisfied heading into the final two months of the season if he
made no more deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely; there's no question about that,'' he said. ``We're
an improved team significantly at shortstop. I think we've
addressed that need in the bullpen to have a complement to Turk
from the right side late in the game. Trammell gives us some of
that right-handed power that we wanted to have.''
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old White is durable, in the Turk Wendell style. He
ranks first in the American League with 71 1/3 relief innings,
after ranking second last year. Phillips said White is ``a
combination of Wendell and Pat Mahomes,'' throwing fastballs and
sliders like Wendell and able to pitch in long relief, like
Mahomes. White is especially tough on right-handers, who are
hitting .172 off him.
</P>
<P>
   White, who has a 3.41 earned-run average, will primarily be used
in the late innings, giving the Mets two capable right-handed
set-up men to go with their left-handed tandem of Dennis Cook and
John Franco. There will be a corresponding roster move to fit White
on the team, which could make the struggling Rich Rodriguez the odd
man out.
</P>
<P>
   Trammell, 28, has had success for Tampa Bay as a part-time
player, hitting .285 with 33 home runs in 671 at-bats over the last
three years. With Benny Agbayani starting, the Mets have had only
one right-handed power hitter off the bench, Todd Pratt, but he is
a catcher and thus pinch-hits infrequently.
</P>
<P>
   Trammell fits in nicely as a reserve, Phillips said, and he
could also start. ``He's heading into the prime of his career,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The prospects the Mets traded for Bordick _ Brea and Gorman _
are hard-throwers who will probably be relievers if they reach the
major leagues. Brea, 21, was 5-8 with a 4.24 earned-run average as
a starter at Double-A Binghamton. The 22-year-old Gorman, whom
Orioles vice president for baseball operations Syd Thrift said was
the pivotal player in the deal, had 15 saves for Single-A Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The more recognizable prospects the Mets traded are Tyner and
Wilson, who will join the Devil Rays' major league roster, at least
initially.
</P>
<P>
   While the Mets believed Tyner, their top pick in the 1998 draft,
would hit in the majors, they were unsure of his defensive ability
and have been impressed by Timoniel Perez, another Triple-A Norfolk
outfielder with speed and more power.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, picked first overall in the 1994 draft, was a
sentimental favorite. The 27-year-old right-hander has come back
from serious elbow and shoulder surgeries to have a solid season at
Norfolk, going 5-5 with a 4.23 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   But Phillips also believed Wilson is more likely to pitch at the
back end of a major league rotation. He added: ``I just absolutely
motivated him to prove me wrong.''

JAPAN'S PLANS TO WIDEN WHALE HUNT PROVOKES OBJECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite strong objections, Japan plans to sent its whaling fleet
into the North Pacific on Saturday to hunt sperm whales and Bryde's
whales, two rare and little-understood species, along with minke
whales, a more common variety.
</P>
<P>
   It is acting under a research program that is opposed by many
countries and by private environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   An international moratorium on commercial whaling took effect in
1986, but under a provision that allowed some killing for
scientific research, Japan began harvesting several hundred minke
whales a year. The meat has been sold to Japanese consumers, for
whom it is a delicacy.
</P>
<P>
   That effort has been criticized by many countries as commercial
whaling by another name, but the annual take of minkes was largely
tolerated by other governments because the species is abundant.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, Washington and London reacted with anger after
Japan said it would harvest two species that were nearly hunted to
extinction by fleets of factory ships in recent decades. President
Clinton and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain have been
prominent critics of the expanded hunting.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly vexing to the Clinton administration was the
resumption of plans to kill sperm whales, the type immortalized in
``Moby-Dick.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really an aggressive move by Japan,'' said Rolland
Schmitten, the deputy assistant secretary of commerce for
international affairs, after a meeting with Japanese officials at
the White House. ``We let them know that we opposed this at the
highest level. These whales do not have to be killed for the
science. We were prepared to work with them on nonlethal ways to
collect the same information.''
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese officials agreed to reduce the total harvest to 100
whales from a planned take of 160, administration officials said.
But the rarer species were not dropped from the plan.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said Clinton would consider using trade
sanctions to try to dissuade Japan from carrying out its whaling
plan. They said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright planned to
discuss the matter on a visit to Japan on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Japanese Embassy in Washington issued a statement
saying the purpose was to study the diet and ecology of the
animals. The statement said sperm and Bryde's whales would be
included ``because their populations are relatively abundant and in
good condition.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision comes three weeks after the International Whaling
Commission, a 55-year-old group of former and current whaling
countries, rejected the Japanese plan to expand its scientific
whale hunt to include the new species.
</P>
<P>
   The group's scientific committee said that Japan's research plan
was flawed and that most of the data could be obtained without
killing whales.
</P>
<P>
   P.J. Crowley, a spokesman for the National Security Council,
said, ``While they are technically allowed under international law
to do this, it's our view that the world is moving in one direction
in terms of conservation and Japan appears to be moving in a
different direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Several private environmental groups said that while a few sperm
whales have been hunted sporadically by aboriginal groups around
the world, this would be the first large-scale harvest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision by Japan is a slap in the face of President
Clinton, Prime Minister Blair and many others around the world who
have been working to persuade Japan to cancel its plans,'' said
Fred O'Regan, president of the International Fund for Animal
Welfare, which studies whale populations.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmental groups said they feared that the Japanese
move could unravel a consensus that with a few exceptions had ended
large-scale whaling. Norway hunts minke whales, and Finland and
Iceland have conducted research on whaling in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Mott, vice president at the World Wildlife Fund, said,
``This hints at a return to the kind of factory ship whaling that
was responsible for the near-extinction of many species of whales
in the first palce.''

 &HT;    Corporate bucks will wine, dine delegates
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Republicans gather in Philadelphia, there's a
lot of wooing going on.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's biggest companies, often with crucial issues before
Congress, are pouring millions of dollars into the Republican
National Convention, and they'll do it again in a couple of weeks
when the Democrats meet in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based United Parcel Service is giving $1 million in cash
and services to both. So are Microsoft and AT&AMP;T, which is providing
delegates calling cards to go with pillows from Hilton Hotels and
other gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Various Republican Party organizations, including the committees
charged with helping get Republicans elected to the House and
Senate, will put on lavish feasts, meal after meal, day after day,
to say thank you to their biggest contributors and to ask them to
open their checkbooks again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conventions are good for raising money,'' said Stuart Roy,
spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. ``But
even more important may be the chance for our candidates to meet
donors who can give them the resources they need in the fall.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday evening, the committee has four events for
benefactors. Later, the ``Main Event Fight Night'' bash will
feature former heavyweight boxing champs Larry Holmes and Michael
Spinks. A NASCAR-themed event includes getting to sit in race cars
and meet driver Terry Labonte and race car owner and former
football coach Joe Gibbs.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party's six-figure donors will dine with House
Speaker Dennis Hastert and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
breakfast with top aides to Texas Gov. George W. Bush and brunch
with former Presidents Bush and Ford on the convention's last day.
</P>
<P>
   To critics of campaign financing, the convention illustrate what
is wrong. ``They are glorified money drops for special interests,''
said Scott Harshbarger, chairman of the political reform group
Common Cause. ``It's a microcosm of the entire problem of these
unregulated contributions. It demonstrates every possible loophole
in both giving and receiving.''
</P>
<P>
   By that, Harshbarger means the corporate contributions would be
illegal if given to the parties directly. But they are legal
because they are made to ``host committees''in the cities staging
the conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Another facet of the problem, he said, is that the donors
maintain they are doing their civic duty or making business
decisions. They deny they are trying to influence politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who solicit and get these contributions are going
to remember who gave,'' he said. ``At a minimum, these donors have
recognition by, and access to, the president and the leaders of
both parties.'' Few delegates in Philadelphia will leave hungry or
empty-handed, thanks to utilities and car makers, defense firms and
computer giants.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia delegates can eat Sunday brunch at their hotel, courtesy
of Atlanta Gas Light, Coca-Cola, the Georgia Electric Membership
Corp., Lockheed Martin, Oglethorpe Power Corp., Columbus-based
Synovus Financial Corp. and Turner Broadcasting Systems.
</P>
<P>
   And just when they get hungry again, they'll attend a reception
Sunday evening at the Philadelphia Academy of Music, where the food
and drink is courtesy of several banks and investment firms.
</P>
<P>
   This year's conventions may cost more than $100 million each,
and private businesses are paying most of the bill.

NAPSTER WINS BRIEF REPRIEVE FROM TWO JUDGES 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX BERENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Two federal appeals judges in Northern California
delivered a last-minute reprieve for Napster Inc. on Friday
afternoon, overriding a judge's injunction and ruling that the
Internet music-swapping service can continue to allow its users to
trade copyrighted music.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected decision, by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in California, stayed the preliminary injunction issued
against Napster on Wednesday by Chief Judge Marilyn Patel of U.S.
District Court in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   After finding a high probability that she would decide against
Napster at trial, Patel ordered the company to stop its users from
trading copyrighted songs. Napster said the order, which would have
taken effect at midnight Friday, Pacific time, would have crippled
the service, since it was impossible for it to distinguish which
music was copyrighted and which was not.
</P>
<P>
   But the appeals judges said Friday that ``substantial
questions'' had been raised about the ``merits and form of the
injunction.''
</P>
<P>
   Napster, which says it has more than 20 million users, is a
specialized Internet search engine that enables users to find and
trade songs between their computers. It was sued in December by
major record companies, represented by the Recording Industry
Association of America, which accused Napster of contributing to
copyright infringement.
</P>
<P>
   Napster's chief executive, Hank Barry, said Friday that he was
``gratified and appreciative'' of the ruling, which will last until
a three-judge appeals court panel can hear arguments on whether the
injunction should be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   That hearing has yet to be scheduled, but it will be held
shortly after the panel finishes taking written arguments on Sept.
12.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Fanning, who created Napster last year as a freshman at
Northeastern University, said Friday: ``I am happy and grateful
that we do not have to turn away our 20 million users and that we
can continue to help artists.''
</P>
<P>
   The Recording Industry Association of America could appeal
Friday's decision, either to the full 9th Circuit Court or to the
U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Hilary Rosen, president of the RIAA, said she was disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Court of Appeals decision today granting Napster a
temporary stay of the preliminary injunction is obviously a
disappointment, but we remain confident that the court will
ultimately affirm once it has had an opportunity to review the
facts and the law,'' Rosen said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is frustrating, of course, that the tens of millions of
daily infringements occurring on Napster will be able to continue,
at least temporarily.''
</P>
<P>
   While the ruling buys Napster time, it does nothing to change
Patel's apparent distaste for the company, said Dave Goldberg,
chief executive of Launch Media, an Internet music company that
works with both new media companies and traditional music
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think in the long run its going to make much
difference. All this does is a stay of execution. It's not any
determination of right or wrong,'' Goldberg said. ``You've got a
trial judge who it looks like has already decided what the result's
going to be at trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Since being created last year by Fanning, Napster has become one
of the Internet's fastest-growing Web sites. The free service
enables users to swap songs, in the form of MP3 files, between
their computers.
</P>
<P>
   About 500,000 to 800,000 people use Napster daily, or 1 percent
to 2 percent of U.S. Internet users, according to Nielsen/Net
Ratings, an Internet audience-measurement service, though other
experts say that estimate is probably low.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I love Napster, and all my friends do, too,'' said Cyrus
Kharas, 14, of Chevy Chase, Md. ``My friends and I, we get home at
11:30 or midnight from a movie, or whatever, and the first thing we
do is start downloading from Napster.''
</P>
<P>
   But the record industry argues that Napster operates nothing
more than a flea market filled with stolen property _ copyrighted
songs that must otherwise be bought in stores. And some Napster
users acknowledge that they use the service as a way to avoid
paying for music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the idea of having this service for free,'' Kharas
said. ``I don't think I would pay for MP3 service. Getting it
without paying is part of the fun, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Napster argues that it actually helps the record companies by
enabling listeners to preview songs free that they will then buy as
CDs. It also argues that its users should be allowed to trade songs
with one another for their personal use, just as they can with
taped CDs they have bought for their own use.

 &HT;    Win or lose, Bush is ready for the race
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The George W. Bush presidential campaign, which
tried to navigate below the political radar screens for months,
maybe years, hit the TV screens with a wooden speech by a governor
not acclaimed as a great orator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow,'' Bush said in March 1999 at the Austin Convention
Center, ``I will file papers forming an exploratory committee so I
can take the next step in considering a campaign for president of
the United States. This will allow my friends to begin assessing
the level of support for my candidacy and to begin raising funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Support turned out to be good. Fund raising turned out even
better.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen months later _ having more or less stayed the course _
Bush on Thursday will accept the GOP presidential nomination at the
First Union Center here.
</P>
<P>
   He is still not a great speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how hard it is for you to put food on your family,'' he
said campaigning in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rarely is the question asked: Is our children learning?'' he
stated in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   But say what you will about his intelligence, his past, the
state of the state of Texas and his one-man war on his native
tongue, Bush got from there to here. The not-ready-for-pop-quiz
candidate is heading here for a four-day coronation that he sees as
a milepost en route to a Jan. 20 inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   Befitting a prince who came on board with money, title and
pedigree, Bush gets little credit for making it this far. He
vanquished the GOP field, knocking off at least one other candidate
with a famous name (Elizabeth Dole), one with unlimited personal
wealth (Steve Forbes), a yapping pack of further-to-the-right
contenders who damned Bush as a moderate (Forbes, Gary Bauer, Alan
Keyes, Dan Quayle), and, finally, a
war-hero-turned-political-reformer (John McCain).
</P>
<P>
   He's been branded as a waffler, a possible ex-drug-using draft
dodger, a candidate unwilling to play by the fund-raising rules and
a smirker who shies from reading books without pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Bush responded to the criticism and questions just as former foe
Ann Richards predicted he would. He stayed on point. Voters still
do not know whether he ever used illegal drugs, and his non-answer
does not seem to have impacted the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you run against George Bush he is going to have one
message,'' Richards said last July. ``He is going to say that
message until the world gags and everybody else is going to be able
to say it back.''
</P>
<P>
   She was right. Bush has said the phrases ``compassionate
conservative'' and ``I'm a uniter, not a divider'' enough times for
comedians to use them as punchlines _ a sure sign that the words
have hit saturation level.
</P>
<P>
   It's gone so well that some see a candidate who is still
untested.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has had a pretty soft ride to this point,'' said University
of Texas presidential scholar Bruce Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   However you rate the ride, Bush successfully completed it and,
win or lose in November, he has changed the face of presidential
politics and the Republican Party. Perhaps most significantly, he
has changed the face that pops into people's minds when they hear
the words ``George Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Phase II begins this week. And it could be ugly. Vice President
Al Gore, who picks up the Democratic nomination in Los Angeles in
two weeks, has a story line picked out: Big guy vs. the little guy.
Us vs. them. Truth and justice teamed up against the scion of the
evil empire.
</P>
<P>
   ``This contest is really about whose side are you on,'' Gore
said in shaping up the race. ``I'm for the people. My opponent is
for the powerful. The old guard is trying to get back in.''
</P>
<P>
   The last guy to try that approach against Bush got some traction
with it, especially in New Hampshire. In the Granite State, McCain,
now a Bush backer, dealt the frontrunner a stunning defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Test of character,'' Bush said aboard the charter flight that
got him the heck out of New Hampshire as quickly as it could.
</P>
<P>
   ROUTE TO PHILADELPHIA
</P>
<P>
   Bush's road to the nomination began in 1998 as he swept to
gubernatorial re-election as national polls made him an early
favorite for the GOP presidential nod. To avoid the Big Lie, Bush
told Texas voters he was thinking about running for president and
might not serve four years if re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   He swamped Democrat Garry Mauro, and, with the national focus on
Austin, pushed through a legislative program, including a tax cut,
that served as the basis for the White House race that began in
March 1999 with the announcement of the exploratory committee.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the campaign, Bush left markers as he tried to
portray himself as a new, more lovable brand of Republican. He
calls it compassionate conservatism, but many Texans recognize it
as similar to what used to pass for conservative Democrat in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1999, on the first swing through New Hampshire, Bush
busted out of the GOP mold by declining to vow to appoint Supreme
Court justices who share his anti-abortion rights view. Later that
month, at a Philadelphia Catholic school of all places, Bush said
an abortion rights supporter could be his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen months later, however, he would appoint Dick Cheney,
whose conservative voting record in Congress is delighting
anti-abortion groups but causing some problems for Bush backers
eager to offer a new, more inclusive image of the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Having set his philosophical marker, Bush quickly moved toward
cementing the front-runner status handed to him by the polls. He
fueled his campaign with other people's money, lots and lots of it.
At a Los Angeles elementary school in June 1999, Bush announced he
had raised more than $36.25 million in three months, $4 million
more than 1996 GOP nominee Bob Dole raised for his entire primary
campaign in 1996. For many of Bush's GOP foes, the race effectively
ended that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money doesn't win. But it's a pretty good start,'' Bush said
in announcing his fund-raising numbers.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Gore had raised only $18.5 million. McCain had
collected $4.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am humbled by the response,'' Bush said of the money that
became as important as his message.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, in a crucial decision that allowed him to spend
without limits, Bush announced he would not accept federal matching
funds for the primary campaign. Only the self-financed Forbes had
ever tried to navigate that path. ``There's a chance I'll be
running against somebody who will be able to jump in a government
airplane and travel the country making promises,'' Bush said of
Gore. ``I want to be able to respond. The best way to do that is to
not take taxpayer dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush family knows something about the advantages a vice
president can have. In 1988, the elder George Bush became the first
incumbent No. 2 man to win the White House since Martin Van Buren
did it in 1836.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he gets to Philadelphia, Bush will have spent almost
all of the more than $90 million he raised. After Thursday, when he
will be the nominee, the Bush campaign becomes a federally funded
effort backed by Republican National Committee money. The same will
happen to Gore after the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's money helped him capture the first make-believe battle _
last summer's Iowa straw poll. In January, he won the Iowa
caucuses, though McCain skipped the event. After McCain's win in
New Hampshire, Bush came back to capture South Carolina after an
appearance at ultra-conservative Bob Jones University that has
become a campaign-trail albatross. The New Hampshire loss put Bush
in unfamiliar territory. After all the fund raising and months of
polls that showed him as a prohibitive favorite, the McCain win
dented the inevitability of a Bush nomination. The governor, who
preaches kinder, gentler politics, struck back with an
uncharacteristic barrage of slaps at McCain, including a radio ad
that accused McCain of opposing federal backing of cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   The ad, which offered a simplified version of the truth,
inspired former U.S. Rep. Guy Molinari of New York to drop his
support of Bush and sign on with McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain traded unpleasantries for several weeks. McCain
took major wins in the Arizona and Michigan primaries, but Bush
clinched the nomination with March wins around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout it all, Bush stayed on message and resisted pressure
to shake up his team, headed by longtime confidante and
ever-confident Karl Rove.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question will be over the course of the primary season who
is able to compete nationally and has a broader base of support in
the Republican Party,'' Rove said three weeks before Iowa kicked
off the political season. ``The answer is George W. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove's crystal ball proved accurate on March blew a big lead,
almost $100 million and became the back end of the only father-son
combination ever to lose presidential races.
</P>
<P>
   But win or lose, Bush has changed the landscape of American
politics. His fund-raising success could lead to major changes in
how future candidates run. His overtures to non-GOP constituencies
could pay off, if not for him then for future Republican
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   And, slowly but surely, he has come out of the family shadow and
became the rare son who re-named his father.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, it was George Bush and George W. Bush, with the
son needing the middle-initial modifier to distinguish him from the
more-famous father.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent news release announcing a Beaumont appearance by the
ex-president at the 100th anniversary of the nation's first oil
gusher, the elder Bush suddenly sprouted middle initials.
</P>
<P>
   ``George H.W. Bush to keynote Spindletop 2001 re-enactment,''
said the headline.

 &HT;    Jakes' may move due to low city
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bishop T.D. Jakes, unhappy with the financial support
offered by the city and its corporations, said he may not bring his
hugely successful ``Woman, Thou Art Loosed!'' conference back to
Atlanta next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we walk away, it's because we're pushed away,'' Jakes said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   This is the third year the conference has been in Atlanta and is
once again expected to draw nearly a quarter-million women before
it ends today.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Jakes broke the Georgia Dome's single-day attendance
record, set by the Rev. Billy Graham, when he drew a crowd of
81,000.
</P>
<P>
   Jakes said it costs him ``well in the millions'' to stage the
three-day annual conference. He contends his event should be
treated in the same manner as the NFL's Super Bowl because it
generates more than $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimate Super Bowl XXXIV in January actually
delivered twice that amount in tax and tourist dollars to Atlanta.
The city government contributed $300,000 to host the sporting
event, while the business community and the state offered financial
inducements and contributions of nearly $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Jakes said city and corporate officials give him the
``run-around'' when he seeks greater financial incentives.
</P>
<P>
   DeWayne Martin, Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell's chief of staff,
said the city halved the Atlanta Civic Center rental fee for a play
produced by Jakes and gave him additional discounts for the Georgia
Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Graham paid $80,000 to rent the Dome five years ago and
the Southern Baptist Convention paid nearly twice that last year
for the facility, Martin said. Jakes paid $75,000, the city
official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hopeful that he sees our efforts as a sign of good faith
and that he will come back next year,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Jakes praised the people and clergy of Atlanta but said he might
move his event to Houston next year where he can cut his costs in
half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is sending me around . . . to different people,'' he
said. ``I got other people from other areas who are saying, 'Just
try us one time.' ``

STRAWBERRY SAYS CANCER MAY HAVE SPREAD
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES C. McKINLEY JR.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Darryl Strawberry's life _ a seemingly endless series of drug
relapses, suspensions, injuries, cancer and comebacks on the
baseball diamond _ took an unfortunate turn Friday, when the former
slugger said his colon cancer, first discovered and treated in
1998, had returned.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry told a Florida television station Friday that his
cancer had recurred. He declined a request for an interview with
The New York Times. Strawberry's wife, Charisse, said he would have
more tests before undergoing treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough, but I think Darryl has a good attitude about it,''
she said in a telephone interview Friday night from the couple's
home in Tampa. ``He's ready to attack this aggressively. That's
what the doctors advised him to do. They told him he's young. He
recovered from this the first time. He'll do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, the New York Yankees said Strawberry
had undergone a CAT scan under the supervision of his doctor, John
Lepook, that ``suggests the possibility that his colon cancer has
spread to lymph nodes'' near his original tumor. Strawberry will
undergo more tests early next week ``to further define the
situation,'' the statement said. It remained unclear Friday night
when the scan was performed and when Strawberry learned of possibly
cancerous lymph nodes.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry's announcement came as the former star had once again
landed in trouble with law-enforcement authorities in Florida. Last
February, Strawberry was suspended for a year from major league
baseball for cocaine use, his third suspension for drug abuse in
five years. In March he checked himself into the Sobrenity, Inc.,
clinic in Fort Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
   But sometime in the last six weeks, he abruptly left the clinic,
after only three months of treatment, saying he needed to return to
baseball to make money. He has been seen and photographed attending
a local club, Trapeze II, where patrons pay membership fees to
engage in casual sex with each other.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Sports Illustrated published a photograph of
Strawberry with a bare-chested woman at the club, landing the
baseball player in trouble with his probation officers in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The former Yankee, Met and Dodger is on probation after being
arrested in April 1999 in Tampa, charged with possessing cocaine
and soliciting an undercover police officer posing as a prostitute.
As part of his probation, he not only must abstain from drugs, but
must avoid establishments where alcohol is the main source of
income.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry was scheduled to meet with Florida corrections
officials Friday to explain his presence at the club. To reporters,
he has denied that he is a member of the Trapeze club and has
dismissed the Sports Illustrated report as ``garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   He has also maintained that he has been busy trying to negotiate
a minor league contract with the Saints, an independent team in St.
Paul, Minnesota. ``I needed to start making a living,'' Strawberry
told the Daily News earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   But his statements Friday suggest he may have had other reasons
besides financial problems for checking himself out of the
Sobrenity, Inc., clinic. He told a reporter from WFLA-TV in Tampa
Friday morning: ``I have some physical issues that I have to deal
with that's more important right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if his cancer had returned, Strawberry said: ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Charisse Strawberry said her husband was in a peaceful mood
despite the bad news. He has been encouraged, she said, by the
comeback of Lance Armstrong, the cyclist who overcame testicular
cancer and won the Tour de France twice. She also acknowledged that
Strawberry was still fighting his addictions to drugs and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have two diseases, there are going to be relapses and
recurrences,'' she said. ``Baseball is the farthest thing from our
minds. Darryl's health is first.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing we can do about it,'' she added. ``We have
three children. We have to deal with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry underwent colon surgery and began chemotherapy less
than two years ago, in October 1998, as his teammates were winning
the World Series. He went to spring training in February 1999,
hoping for a quick comeback. But the Yankees decided that he was
not yet strong enough after his treatment to play by opening day.
He was left behind in Tampa to continue working out, but on April
14, the police in Tampa arrested him for soliciting sex from an
undercover officer posing as a prostitute. They also found less
than a gram of cocaine in his wallet. He pleaded no contest in
court. Commissioner Bud Selig suspended him from baseball for 120
days and a Florida judge sentenced him to 18 months probation.
</P>
<P>
   Though he eventually returned to the Yankees and played in the
1999 World Series, Strawberry apparently could not resist the lure
of cocaine. In January, he tested positive for cocaine during a
periodic test administrated by major league baseball. Selig again
suspended him, this time for a full year, and Strawberry sacrificed
his $750,000 salary.
</P>
<P>
   His former Yankees teammates, who were in Minneapolis to play
the Twins, reacted with shock and sadness to the news their
colleague might be facing a second round of cancer treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had just gotten over cancer, and what can you say?'' Derek
Jeter, the shortstop, said. ``Everyone is shocked in here. It's so
unfortunate, and I don't know what else to say?''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' manager, Joe Torre, who himself was treated for
prostate cancer last year, said: ``It's very sad. Thank God there's
so many more ways to treat cancer today. He's going to have a tough
time, but hopefully, he'll get it taken care of.''

 &HT;    Gore VP talk lacks mention of women
 &HT;    By Scott Shepard
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In June, just as the Democratic presidential
primaries were nearing an anticlimactic end, the Clinton-Gore
administration boasted of its successes in advancing the political
standing of women since the U.N. conference on women's rights in
Beijing five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But thus far in his very private process of selecting a running
mate, Vice President Al Gore has given few hints that he is ready
to do just that by selecting a woman for the No. 2 spot on the
Democratic ticket this year.
</P>
<P>
   This week, as he began to narrow the number of vice presidential
candidates, Gore suggested that his long list included women,
though he was not specific. ``I think it's only fair to the men and
women involved to keep it private and dignified,'' he said of his
selection process.
</P>
<P>
   But hardly any of the news accounts of Gore's selection process
speculated on the possibility of the vice president selecting a
woman. Most of the speculation centered on Sens. John Kerry of
Massachusetts, Bob Graham of Florida, Evan Bayh of Indiana and Tom
Harkin of Iowa, House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri and
former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   But what about a woman? Is it possible that Gore is haunted by
the ghost of 1984, when Vice President Walter Mondale picked a
little-known New York congresswoman, Geraldine Ferraro, and went on
to the greatest defeat in modern American politics?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that has anything to do with it,'' said Marla
Romash, a longtime political associate of Gore. ``It's more about
numbers than anything else. There just aren't that many women to
choose from.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the ranks of Democratic female politicians are so thin
that noted Democratic pollster Celinda Lake has reached into the
ranks of lieutenant governors for a possible running mate for Gore.
Admittedly, Lake's candidate is no average lieutenant governor:
Kathleen Kennedy Townsend of Maryland, daughter of Robert F.
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   But the vice presidential selection process of both Gore and
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the soon-to-be Republican presidential
nominee, has generally rankled people who had hoped to see more of
a female presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just shows once again that women have an uphill battle in
politics as in any other field dominated by white males,'' said
Mary Hawkesworth, director of the Center for American Women and
Politics at Rutgers University in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   It is the same for women worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to a ``gender balanced'' presidential ticket,
``The political parties like to talk about viability _ or lack of
it,'' added Hawkesworth. ``But the fact is, there are plenty of
women who would be viable candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole, who served in the
last two Republican Cabinets, was widely touted as a possible Bush
running mate. But the governor chose oil industry executive Dick
Cheney, a former congressman and secretary of defense.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore coasted to victory in the Democratic primaries this
spring, generating a guessing game about a running mate, Sen.
Dianne Feinstein of California was mentioned frequently. A seasoned
politician and one of the best speakers in American politics today,
Feinstein has a generally _ but not uniformly _ liberal voting
record.
</P>
<P>
   But Feinstein is up for re-election this year. And she is from a
state that Gore could win this fall without her help. In addition,
she voted against NAFTA, one of the administration's major
accomplishments, and was among the first Democrats to condemn
President Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore's biggest problem (in selecting a female running mate) is
the size of the pool,'' said Jack Pitney, a political science
professor at Clarement-McKenna College in California.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic women account for just six senators, 39 House members
and one governor, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire. Like Feinstein
in the Senate, 37 of the 39 House members are up for re-election _
two are leaving the House. Shaheen also is seeking another term.
</P>
<P>
   The six Democratic senators average 19.8 years each in politics,
topped by Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, 27 years; Feinstein, 26
years; and Barbara Boxer of California, 24 years. The six men most
mentioned as possible Gore running mates average 22.3 years each in
politics, with Graham at the top, 34 years, and Gephardt, 29 years.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio and Louise Slaughter of New York are
the Democratic women who have served the most consecutive years in
the House: Kaptur, 18, and Slaughter, 14. But neither has been
mentioned as a possible running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Neither have Clinton Cabinet members Donna Shalala, Alexis
Herman or Janet Reno. (Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is
barred by the U.S. Constitution from running because she was not
born in the United States.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore's choice has to be perceived by most voters as
presidential,'' said Joel Goldstein, author of ``The Modern
American Vice Presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Romash: ``You don't get on the list in a vacuum; you get
on the list by having years of experience in public service. And
we're still working to increase the number of women available to be
on the list.''

   STOCKS TRADE IN VIETNAM BUT CONFUSION TAKES OVER
</P>
<P>
   With just two stocks, two hours and $5,000 in trades, the
Socialist Republic of Vietnam opened its first stock exchange for
business and took the first faltering steps into the uncertain
world of free markets.
</P>
<P>
   Hopeful investors packed into the three brokerage offices taking
orders for the shares to watch the market's birth on electronic
boards. But curiosity and excitement quickly turned into confusion
and disappointment, when minutes before the Ho Chi Minh City
Securities Trading Center opened, the government imposed a ceiling
on bids that invalidated many people's orders _ some of which were
more than 50 percent above the government's artificially imposed
prices.

</P>
<P>
   Nortel Networks agreed to acquire Alteon WebSystems, which makes

   Robert C. Wright, the longtime president of NBC, was named to
the additional post of vice chairman of General Electric. Wright is

 &HT;    Ga. Power learns from Coca-Cola bias suit
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Power is clearly learning lessons from
Coca-Cola as it deals with a racial discrimination lawsuit from
employees.
</P>
<P>
   President David Ratcliffe hadn't seen this week's lawsuit when
he made plans to address the utility's 8,000 employees in a
statewide closed-circuit television address that afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In that talk Thursday, he made clear the company's policy of
``zero tolerance for discriminatory or racially intolerant
behavior'' and promised to get to the bottom of the allegations and
address them.
</P>
<P>
   Then in an e-mail to the work force Friday, Ratcliffe addressed
the lawsuit's charge that a hangman's noose was displayed on
company premises. He vowed ``swift and effective action'' against
anyone who was involved in intimidating employees.
</P>
<P>
   Michael B. Terry, a lawyer for the employees who are suing, said
Friday he is pleased that Ratcliffe promised to make changes in the
company's diversity policies and discuss a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   But Terry said the utility ``has a history of promises with no
follow-through or enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed in Fulton County Superior Court on Thursday, was
assigned Friday to Judge Elizabeth Long. Georgia Power has 30 days
to file a response.
</P>
<P>
   Ratcliffe emphasized Friday that the three employees who sued
the company ``are doing what they have a right to do'' and said he
had no position yet on whether their charges have merit.
</P>
<P>
   When four Coca-Cola employees filed a similar lawsuit against
their employer on April 22, 1999, one of the company's first
comments was that three of the employees' complaints were without
merit and the fourth employee had been fired for allegedly
violating the company's business code of conduct.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail to Coke's 10,000 U.S. employees in the days after
the suit was filed, then-Chairman M. Douglas Ivester said he took
the allegations seriously but the lawsuit had ``significant errors
of fact.''
</P>
<P>
   In a move six months later that was widely seen as ham-handed,
though it was unrelated to the lawsuit, the company's top-ranking
African-American executive was demoted in a management shakeup.
Carl Ware, who was also chairman of the company's Diversity Action
Council, resigned.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until Ivester was replaced by Doug Daft earlier this
year that Ware was coaxed back to the company, that top managers'
pay was tied to meeting diversity goals and a vice president and
director for diversity strategies appointed.
</P>
<P>
   The beverage giant agreed to settle the case last month, only to
be hit with a $1.5 billion discrimination suit from another group
of employees.
</P>
<P>
   Two veteran public relations executives offered differing
assessments Friday of the two companies' public responses to the
cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Georgia Power has taken this thing seriously and that shows in
their actions,'' said Bob Hope, president of Hope-Beckham, and a
veteran of a number of corporate crisis management operations,
including the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska. ``Coke was slow to
respond and tended to look defensive in their moves.''
</P>
<P>
   Hope, a former Coke executive, credited Georgia Power for ``fast
action from the top, expressing a sense of real concern and doing
things that don't admit to the problem but show tolerance to the
possibility of the problem having existed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bob Cohn, chairman of 360, a marketing agency, said that
given a recent series of highly publicized racial discrimination
complaints against Coca-Cola and other well-known Georgia
companies, Georgia Power should not have waited until a lawsuit was
filed to investigate its own standing. ``It's pretty late in the
game. Somebody should have been on top of this a long time ago,''
said Cohn.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Baskin, a spokesman for Coke, declined to engage in any
comparisons Friday. ``It wouldn't be appropriate for us to comment
on a legal case involving another company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But there are parallels in the Coke and Georgia Power cases.
</P>
<P>
   The same Atlanta law firm, Bondurant, Mixon &AMP; Elmore, represents
plaintiffs in both cases. Both suits sought standing as class
actions representing about 2,000 employees at each company.
</P>
<P>
   Another link is that Ware is one of three African-American board
members at Georgia Power. Ware, now Coke's executive vice president
for global public affairs, was not available for comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While both cases allege a pattern of racial discrimination in
employment and compensation practices, the Georgia Power case also
alleges a ``reckless indifference'' by the company to racially
hostile workplace conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, the latest case has similarities to two lawsuits
filed in May by 11 black employees of Lockheed Martin Corp. who
alleged a pervasive climate of racism at the aerospace company's
Marietta plant.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ratcliffe, Tom Burbage, top executive at the Marietta
plant, made it clear at the outset that he's willing to negotiate a
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   A settlement, or a judgment against the utility, would certainly
run into the millions of dollars, say legal experts. Ratcliffe said
the company would not seek to pass any such costs to its 1.8
million Georgia ratepayers.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Power has clearly studied Coke's experience and the
utility does appear to be further along than Coke was at this
juncture in dealing with the issues raised in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Ratcliffe announced formation of a Diversity Action Council on
Thursday, co-chaired by Juanita Baranco, another African-American
board member.
</P>
<P>
   A.W. ``Bill'' Dahlberg, chairman and chief executive officer of
Southern Co., Georgia Power's parent and co-defendant in the
discrimination suit, earlier this year made ``improve diversity'' a
top goal and began tying compensation to progress in that area.
</P>
<P>
   The company says it has procedures in place for employees to be
fairly considered for promotions and a ``corporate concerns''
program to bring complaints of discrimination or harassment to the
attention of superiors.
</P>
<P>
   But Christoper C. Womack, human resources vice president at both
Georgia Power and Southern, said the cases of hangman's nooses,
which apparently numbered three, were not brought up through any of
the company's channels.
</P>
<P>
   Womack, one of the company's highest-ranking black executives,
said the companywide review ordered by Ratcliffe will try to find
out why. ``Why were they not utilized?'' he asked. ``We thought we
were in pretty good shape.''

DRAMATIC UPS, DOWNS AND TURNS AT CAMP DAVID 
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE PERLEZ and ELAINE SCIOLINO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The two weeks President Clinton spent with the
leaders of Israel and the Palestinians certainly had moments of
great drama, when nerve-tingling discussions about the fate of the
holy city of Jerusalem breached for the first time what all sides
called the taboo issue.
</P>
<P>
   There were also moments of crisis, as when Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak nearly choked to death on a peanut and White
House officials worried how they would explain his death to
conspiracy theorists around the world. A member of the prime
minister's own team delivered the life-saving Heimlich maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   There were light moments, when Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators traded cigars, bowled, played Ping Pong and dodged deer
and chipmunks as they navigated paved paths in golf carts.
</P>
<P>
   There were bizarre moments, when Clinton broke his own news
blackout by musing about the talks with The New York Daily News,
without telling any of his aides of the interview that was supposed
to help defend his wife against accusations that she made an
anti-Semitic slur in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   And through it all there were negotiations, day and night, as
Clinton, Barak and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, drew on a
their full array of bluffs and brinkmanship, rhetoric and reason as
they invented, rejected and embraced creative solutions to ending
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic moment came mid-way through talks, when
Clinton gripped Arafat's hands tightly, sitting so close to him
that they butted foreheads. The president implored, flattered,
threatened and wooed, promising everything he could _ the creation
of a Palestinian state, the financial support of the world to pay
for it, a permanent place for Arafat in the pantheon of history.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton didn't stop there. It would be another week before the
president acknowledged that the summit would not produce a peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   At 2:10 a.m. last Tuesday, 15 days after Clinton had brought
Israelis and Palestinians to Camp David to resolve issues that had
eluded them for half a century, the 71-year-old Palestinian leader
said no.
</P>
<P>
   But that morning, as the Palestinian leader contemplated
Clinton's offer in his cabin on the secluded, wooded complex,
neither Arafat nor Barak could escape the ghosts of the first Camp
David summit meeting, in 1978, when President Jimmy Carter brought
together Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel and President
Anwar Sadat of Egypt for what proved to be successful peace-making.
</P>
<P>
   A glass case of photographs from that summit was prominently
displayed in a cabin called Holly, where many key meetings took
place, and a three-page, hand-written note of appreciation from
Carter to Begin hung on a wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both leaders were preoccupied with the weight and presence of
history,'' said Aaron D. Miller, a senior U.S. negotiator. ``There
was a sense that we were not alone.''
</P>
<P>
   The last moment came when Arafat sent Saeb Erekat, a trusted
aide, and Mohammed Dahlan, the Palestinian chief of security, to
Clinton's cabin, with grim faces and a brief letter, hand-written
in Arabic on the official stationery of the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Erakat slowly read the letter aloud, translating for Clinton and
advisers who were with him, including Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and Samuel Berger, the national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't go further than I've gone,'' a senior administration
official paraphrased Arafat as saying. ``The suggestions I have
heard do not take us in the direction I find acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to fail,'' Clinton told his aides after the
emissaries left, ``particularly at this.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter did not surprise. Even though Clinton had used all of
his powers of persuasion to coax a shaken Arafat into a settlement,
he already had the sense that the Palestinian leader was
disengaging, becoming even more quiet and passive than he had been
during the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton had been intense in his pitch-making, so intense
that a half-dozen of his aides, including chief negotiator Dennis
Ross and chief of staff John Podesta, hid themselves in the kitchen
to eavesdrop on the president's head-butting session with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   They took turns watching the scene through a porthole in the
swinging glass door that led to the living room, cracking the door
a little to catch snippets of the conversation. At one point, one
of the aides recounted, so many of them pressed against the glass
that he feared they would push the door open and pour into the room
like bureaucratic Marx brothers.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, this was not Arafat's time to make the boldest
gesture of his 30-year career as the leader of the Palestinian
people. And after his letter was delivered, Clinton would be with
him again only briefly, in a good-bye session with Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president sat with them and told them that everyone has
worked very hard and given their best but they couldn't get
there,'' Albright recalled in an interview. ``They shook hands. And
that was that.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, another chapter in the peace effort concluded. It had
been a failed negotiation, but it had been a remarkable one as
well, and already Israeli and Palestinian negotiators were talking
about getting together again.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For more than a month, Clinton had been eager to convene a
summit. Barak was badgering him to do it, arguing in repeated phone
calls that only what he called ``the pressure cooker'' of a summit
would force through excruciating decisions.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Arafat wanted a few more weeks to prepare. ``He said, `The
time is not ripe,' Albright said of her meeting with Arafat in late
June. ``But he also said that he had the highest respect for the
president and would do as he was asked.''
</P>
<P>
   Driving the decision was the reality of the U.S. political
calendar. Holding the summit during the Republican convention, in
early August, was out of the question, because it could be seen by
Republicans to be politically driven. Clinton was also boxed in by
a commitment to go to Japan on July 19. Most importantly, the
deadline of Sept. 13 loomed large _ the date by which Arafat said
he would unilaterally declare a state.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials acknowledge that Arafat bore the
greatest burden.
</P>
<P>
   None of the Arab leaders with whom he had consulted _ including
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, King Abdullah of Jordan and Crown
Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia _ offered him support for
surrendering claim to sovereignty over any part of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   For the first several days of the talks, both sides postured. At
one point, Clinton got so angry that he told both sides, ``This is
ridiculous. If this is what you're going to do, we shouldn't be
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, suddenly and without warning, discussions opened up,
substantively, on the most serious of issues: the status of
Jerusalem. On July 17, the sixth day of the summit, Barak put down
on paper proposals to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As Barak put final touches on his proposals, he did what he
always does when he feels pressured: he ate.
</P>
<P>
   A peanut lodged in his throat, and for 40 tense seconds, he
stopped breathing as helpless aides looked on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was scary, but the people around the prime minister were
more scared than the prime minister,'' recalled Amnon
Lipkin-Shahak, a senior Israeli negotiator. One aide began pounding
him on the back, to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Gid Gernstein, the youngest member of the Israeli
delegation, rushed to Barak and performed the Heimlich maneuver on
him. A peanut came flying out.
</P>
<P>
   When Barak arrived at Clinton's doorstep after midnight, he had
some ideas that moved away from the traditional Israeli position on
Jerusalem. When Clinton took the ideas to Arafat, he was singularly
unimpressed, an American official said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the talks, Arafat seemed oddly passive. He referred
to himself repeatedly as the ``permanent vice president'' of the
organization uniting Muslim countries around the world. ``He wasn't
speaking just for himself,'' one senior official said. ``He was
speaking for a billion Muslims and the 2 million Arabs in the
region as well.''
</P>
<P>
   To bridge the differences, the Americans presented ideas of
their own to Arafat. In the living room of his cabin on the evening
of July 18, Clinton sat him down and, with only Gemal Helal, the
State Department's Arabic interpreter, at his side, told the
Palestinian what a mistake he was making.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president said to Arafat: `I will go to the G-8 meeting in
Japan on Wednesday and I will ask them to provide the support you
need for your state,' '' Berger recounted. ``What I ask you to do
is to make a principled compromise on Jerusalem. It is not
everything you want, but the price you have to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat said little as Clinton grabbed him by the arms and butted
his forehead to Arafat's forehead in what Berger called ``the
Lyndon B. Johnson style of persuasion.''
</P>
<P>
   When that tactic did not work, Clinton then suggested to Arafat
that he consider a partial settlement _ deferring Jerusalem for
later. Arafat refused.
</P>
<P>
   The morning of Clinton's departure arrived, and the president
decided there was little point in continuing the talks.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At 10:50 pm, the White House press office released a
two-sentence statement that screamed ``failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Then a strange thing happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``As word went out, the trees talked,'' said Berger, referring
to the instant rumor network at Camp David. Barak was convinced by
several of his negotiators that he should not go home empty-handed.
Arafat never wanted to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton left for Japan and, in his absence, the mood calmed. Dr.
Albright invited Arafat to her farm in Leesburg, Va., where they
dined on canned sardines (which he requested, Albright said).
Barak, meanwhile, visited Gettysburg with Albright and Bruce
Riedel, the senior Middle East official at the National Security
Council and a Civil War buff.  &QL; 
By the time Clinton returned from Japan that Sunday night, the
negotiators reported enough progress to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   In three back-to-back sessions, Clinton, seated at the dining
room table in his cabin, with two negotiators from each side, made
headway on security, refugees and borders. For the sake of a peace
to ensure Israel's security, Barak was entertaining a sizable
transfer of West Bank territory, the evacuation of settlements, a
land swap, a small resettlement plan for Palestinian refugees and
the ceding of some Jerusalem neighborhoods to the Palestinians. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We could begin to see the contours of an agreement on these
issues,'' said Berger.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now was the moment for the final push on Jerusalem. Clinton
asked each leader to appoint a single negotiator to meet with him
on what turned out to be the last night of the summit. Between
Clinton and Dennis Ross, the special coordinator for the Middle
East, sat Erekat and the Israeli, Shlomo Ben Ami. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton presented three scenarios for Jerusalem, with variations
along the way, diplomats said. The first laid out how the issues of
sovereignty might be resolved, including in the old city where the
Palestinians would be given sovereignty over the Muslim and
Christian quarters and the Israelis would have the Jewish and
Armenian quarters. Another proposal revolved around Palestinian
sovereignty over several of the neighborhoods surrounding the Old
City and having administrative autonomy within the walls. A third
notion suggested deferring the Jerusalem problem for years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also put forward the possibility: no agreement at all.
As he talked through the proposals, Erekat's body language made
clear that the Palestinians were not playing, and it was codified
in Arafat's letter.
</P>
<P>
   Berger, a lawyer, underscored that sense of a continuum, when he
blamed Arafat for not accepting the deal Clinton offered, and then
took part of his statement back. ``Arafat wasn't able to make that
leap,'' Berger said in an interview. ``Let me make my tenses
correct. Arafat was not at this point able to make that leap.''

   SPRINGDALE, ARK _ Gov. George W. Bush told a cheering crowd of
2,000 Friday that he, ``found the right man in Dick Cheney,'' as
the GOP running mates launched a pre-convention tour through six
swing states in six days before arriving in Philadelphia for the
Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Bush traveled with his wife Laura to President Clinton's home
state where the couple joined with Cheney and his wife Lynne. U.S.
Rep. Asa Hutchison and his brother, U.S. Sen. Tim Hutchison, both
of Arkansas, and U.S. Rep. Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican, were
among those who welcomed the Bushes at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Philadelphia GOP leaders fended off an attempt to
moderate the party's policy on abortion as the platform committee
fine-tuned its plank before the convention begins Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides also stepped in to veto a plan to change the party's
primary election process for 2004. The so-called ``Delaware Plan,''
which would have allowed smaller, less influential states to hold
their primaries first was nixed after Bush aides said the governor
did not want any changes for now because there were too many
problems with forcing states to comply with the plan.
</P>
<P>
   In his introduction in Arkansas, Asa Hutchison lauded Cheney,
who came under immediate attack from Democrats for his conservative
voting record and ties to the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did Gov. Bush make the right decision in picking Secretary
Cheney as his running mate?'' Hutchison asked a cheering crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he is looking forward to the trek to Philadelphia
where he is scheduled to arrive on Thursday to deliver what will
be, arguably, the most important speech of his political career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It buoys my heart and it buoys my spirit to know we're working
our way to Philadelphia for the Republican National Convention and
working our way across battleground states that the Republican
ticket hasn't been able to carry in the last two election cycles,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton won Arkansas in 1992 as he dashed Bush's father's
re-election hopes. Four years later, he beat former U.S. Sen. Bob
Dole here. No GOP presidential candidate has won any of the states
on the pre-convention tour since 1988. Campaign spokeswoman Karen
Hughes said they chose the route, a veritable trail of tears for
the GOP, because, ``we are not ceding any territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, who was defense secretary under President Bush, promised
victory in 2000 _ but not without state-by-state warfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a tough campaign, make no mistake about it,''
Cheney said. ``We're going to have to fight every single day in
every single state...''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said that Bush is putting the final touches on his
convention speech. The speech is nearly 3,900 words long and should
take about 45 minutes to deliver, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he is looking forward to giving the speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dynamic moment in my life to walk out on the stage
and to speak from my heart for however long it takes to get through
the speech,'' he said, adding that he wants the American people to
learn that he is, ``a decisive, firm leader who's got good
judgement and is ready to lead the nation.''

CABLETRON PREPARES TO DIVIDE AND CONQUER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 30)  
 By KATE BERRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Are four spinoffs better than one whole company? That is the
puzzle facing holders of Cabletron Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Once a highflier in computer networking, Cabletron lacks the
size and vigor to compete across the board with the likes of Cisco
Systems and Lucent Technologies. So it announced in February that
it would split into four operating units and sell stakes of up to
20 percent in each to the public over the next 18 months, on the
theory that four nimble baby Cabletrons would excite investors _
and potential acquirers _ more than the parent could. The company,
based in Rochester, N.H., has also unloaded about $600 million in
noncore assets in the revamping.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do I take a company that is growing 4 to 6 percent
year-over-year and transform it into one growing 30 percent a
year?'' asked Piyush Patel, Cabletron's chairman and chief
executive, in an interview. ``One of the things holding us back is
I had one model peanut-buttered on four different businesses. They
could not reach their highest potential.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Wall Street was underwhelmed, and Cabletron's stock
rode the technology downdraft harder than its peers, plummeting
from $52 a share in early March to $18.625 in April. It has since
rebounded to around $25, largely on the faith of Silver Lake
Partners, a private equity firm in Menlo Park, Calif., that manages
$2.3 billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Lake has committed $90 million so far to Cabletron's four
IPOs-in-waiting, and has bet on a rise in the parent's stock by
buying warrants and convertible preferred shares. A Silver Lake
partner, David Roux, is on Cabletron's board.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parts are worth more than the whole,'' said Jim Davidson,
co-founder of Silver Lake. He expects Cabletron stock to rise well
above $50 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Cabletron has been acting like an incubator for a while,
investing in some two dozen technology start-ups whose wireless and
optical-networking products complement its own. Patel's admiration
for CMGI, a leading Internet incubator, is evident in Cabletron's
planned post-spinoff ticker symbol, CSGI. (It is now CS.) While
bigger rivals have been acquiring actively, Cabletron has piled up
$1.6 billion in cash and no debt.
</P>
<P>
   The hottest property among the four imminent spinoffs is
Riverstone Networks, which sells Internet routers and switches for
large-scale networks, the kind that span whole cities. Analysts
expect sales to double this year, reaching $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors like Foundry Networks, Juniper Networks and Redback
Networks have been hot performers, and analysts who like the
revamping plan say Riverstone ought to be valued highly when it
comes to market in the fall. Others said they want to wait and see.
</P>
<P>
   Enterasys Networks, which sells routers and switches to large
corporations, will be the biggest of the four, with $660 million in
sales last year, and projected growth of 20 percent this year. The
other two are much smaller but growing faster: GlobalNetwork
Technology Services, which provides network management and security
and is the second unit expected to come public this year, and
Aprisma Management Technologies, specializing in infrastructure
management software. Aprisma competes with Micromuse and Visual
Networks, whose stock valuations are high.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're throwing out as comparables very attractive category
killers,'' said Megan Graham-Hackett of Standard &AMP; Poor's Equity
Group. ``These other highfliers have a lot of momentum. I'm just a
little wary.''
</P>
<P>
   Cabletron reported a loss of $37.9 million, or 21 cents a share,
in the quarter ended June 30, compared with a loss of $22.5
million, or 13 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue
fell 21 percent, to $275.1 million, reflecting the asset sales.
Patel said Cabletron would return to black ink by year-end.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, analysts say, the picture is less clear. ``If you
take a look at their businesses, they are attractive, but aren't
making money,'' Graham-Hackett said. ``The core business is a
slower growth model,'' she said, and the small spinoffs may lack
the heft to thrive on their own.

FBI FILES WOUND UP AT WHITE HOUSE BY ERROR, REPORT FINDS
</HEADLINE>
  By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration improperly acquired
hundreds of FBI files through a series of errors committed by the
Secret Service and, most of all, by an incompetent investigator in
the White House, according to a report by the independent counsel
that was released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Ray, the independent counsel, announced publicly in March
that he had concluded his investigation of the acquisition of the
files and that there had been no criminal wrongdoing. He filed the
full report with a special judicial panel that oversees independent
counsel investigations, and the report was made public Friday by
the panel's judges.
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded that the files, many of which involved
prominent Republicans, were acquired by the White House office of
personnel security mainly through the mistakes of Anthony Marceca,
a low-level employee there.
</P>
<P>
   Marceca, described by the report as a former Democratic
political advance person, was hired by the head of the office,
Craig Livingstone, to help get its files in order. Livingstone,
also a former political advance aide, had no experience in
security.
</P>
<P>
   Marceca requested that the FBI provide him with confidential
personnel files on any person who worked at the White House. From
the time he started his work in August 1993 until he left the next
year, he requisitioned more than 1,100 such files. The independent
counsel report said at least 726 of them were for people who no
longer worked at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Because many of those were of prominent Republicans, suspicions
were raised in news reports and in Congress that the acquisition
was an effort by Clinton officials to gather political
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining why Ray concluded that was not so, the report said
investigators found that Marceca had requisitioned the files using
an inaccurate list provided by the Secret Service. Although the
Secret Service has denied that it was responsible for preparing
such a list, Ray found that the Secret Service had in fact prepared
a list that was ``unlabeled and overinclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray's report said that Marceca admitted lying to Congress and to
a federal grand jury but that he could not be prosecuted because he
had been given immunity by federal prosecutors. In any event, the
report said, nothing in his testimony affected the conclusion that
there had not been a conspiracy to obtain Republican files.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the Secret Service had been flatly mistaken and
gave misleading testimony when senior officials told Congress and
the press that its computer system was incapable of producing an
outdated list of White House passholders.
</P>
<P>
   Because it denied any responsibility, the prosecutor said, the
Secret Service greatly contributed to the suspicions that the
acquisitions of the files could not have been an innocent mistake
as the White House had said.
</P>
<P>
   In an appendix to the report, a lawyer for three Secret Service
officials disputed the conclusion blaming the Secret Service.
Warren Dennis, a lawyer for Lewis Merletti, the former director of
the service, and for John Libonati and Jeffrey Undercoffer, two
former special agents, said the report was unfair because it
misinterpreted their comments about the agency's computer system.

 TEXAS DEMOCRATS TRAVEL TO GOP CONVENTION AS `TRUTH SQUAD'
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
 By JACK DOUGLAS JR.
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A busload of Texas Democrats began rolling
down the highway this week on a 1,255-mile trek to a huge
convention of Republicans in Philly, talking bad about Gov. George
W. Bush every mile of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are happy warriors, and we're here to say, `Don't mess with
America,' '' LaNell Anderson, a Houston real estate agent and
Democrat stalwart, said by cellphone as the bus crossed over the
Ohio River.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson and her fellow Democrats are expected to be joined by
Fort Worth Mayor Pro Tem Ralph McCloud and state Rep. Lon Burnam,
D-Fort Worth, early Sunday just before the bus enters Philadelphia,
host city of the Republican Party's national convention next week.
</P>
<P>
   They are calling themselves the ``Texas Truth Squad,'' and they
say their mission is to peacefully invade the Republican's
nominating party and ``set the record straight about George W.
Bush's mess in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Texas governor prepares to accept the GOP's presidential
nomination on Thursday, Burnam, Anderson and company said they will
tell anybody willing to listen about what they say is the state's
dismal record concerning pollution, health care and the lack of
insurance for poor children.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats plan a ``Bushwacked barbecue'' on Sunday at a
steelworkers' union hall near the GOP convention. ``My line will be
that George Bush is the worst environmental accident to happen
since the nuclear meltdown in Chernobyl,'' Burnam said, referring
to the 1986 nuclear accident in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said he does
not think that the group will cause much of a stir at the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their views are in the minority in Texas regarding George
Bush, and their views will most likely be in the minority here in
Philadelphia,'' Bartlett said
</P>
<P>
   He credited the governor with cutting taxes, improving schools
and making ``progress in cleaning the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnam said he realizes that he and his small band of Democrats
will be far outnumbered at the Republican convention. ``But,''
Burnam said: ``Davy Crockett was outnumbered at the Alamo, and he
still did the right thing for Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Miller of the Austin-based Proud of Texas Committee, formed
to divert what it says is politically charged _ and often
out-of-state _ criticism of Bush's home state, said the Democrats'
bus trip seems to be fueled only by political rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Texans need to go out and bang on their own
state,'' Miller said, ``but that's their constitutional right.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Hess, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee and
a passenger on the ``truth'' tour, said the group has received warm
receptions from ``working families'' and the media. They embarked
from Louisville, Ky., on Thursday, spent the night in Cincinnati,
and then made stops yesterday in Dayton and Columbus, Ohio, before
stopping in Charleston, W.V., for the night.
</P>
<P>
   Hess said they plan to arrive in Philadelphia on Sunday, the day
before the official opening of the convention, as long as there are
no political ``dirty tricks'' like letting the air out of the
tires.

 &HT;    Olympians bring experience and maturity
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ They're older, wiser and a little banged up. Their
scores aren't what they used to be. But the returning members of
U.S. gymnastics' most illustrious team, the Magnificent Seven,
still carry an aura about them as they compete here in the U.S.
Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Call them the Famous Five.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Miller and Dominique Dawes are two-time Olympians, while
Dominique Moceanu, Amy Chow and Jaycie Phelps joined them in
Atlanta to win the improbable Olympic team gold four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's really cool because you look across the gym and
you see somebody you know, a friend,'' said Chow. ``I want to say
it's like ESP.''
</P>
<P>
   They all have a sixth sense about what each is going through.
After the Olympics, they bonded on the successful post-Olympic
tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spending 24 hours of the day on the bus the majority of the
time gets you talking,'' Miller said. ``We felt like sisters by the
time we had to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Then all but Moceanu retired from the national gymnastics scene,
and she also dropped out of the picture for more than a year
because of injuries and turmoil in her personal life.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's a longshot that all five will be teammates again
in Sydney, none regret the decision to try again. They must finish
in the top 12 tonight to advance to the Olympic Trials Aug. 17-20
in Boston, or petition into the meet. A committee, led by national
team coordinator Bela Karolyi, then will choose the six Olympians.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Chow is third, Moceanu (who rolled her ankle warming
up for her first event Thursday) is 10th, Dawes 13th and Phelps
17th. Miller, who has an injured leg and competed only on uneven
bars on the first day, won't compete tonight, but will petition
into the Trials. So will Phelps, who withdrew with an injured
thigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great having everyone back again,'' Phelps said.
``It's like a family reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Team captain Amanda Borden is sitting in the stands at the Kiel
Center, but has a pass to mingle on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll always miss it and I'll always want to be out there,''
said Borden, a student at Arizona State, ``but at the same time,
I'm really happy with everything I have in my life and I'm able to
move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Kerri Strug, whose courageous vault onto an injured leg
clinched the gold, is missing. She has transferred from UCLA to
Stanford and plans to get a master's degree in sociology
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly expected to have some of them back,'' said Karolyi,
``because they were young and they were capable and they all had
good reasons to come back. But to be honest, I never thought there
was going to be 90 percent of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally do appreciate very much the effort to make
another Olympic team. . . . And some of them definitely will.''
</P>
<P>
   Who? Karolyi chuckled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a couple or three, maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   After a young U.S. team placed a dismal sixth at the 1999 World
Championships, the country needed the experience the older gymnasts
could provide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prestige, the maturity, the overall balance of the team is
basically increasing,'' Karolyi said, ``and it's getting to the
point to be respected.''
</P>
<P>
   Chow, 22, a biology major at Stanford, returned to competition
in 1999. ``I was a little bored,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Phelps, 20, was coaching and attending Arizona State when she
threw her name back in the ring in November. She wanted to prepare
for the post-Olympic tour, and her left knee, which had undergone
three surgeries, was feeling good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I had a lot of gymnastics left in me,'' Phelps
said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, 23, now married and attending the University of
Oklahoma, re-entered the gym in December. She was also preparing
for the tour, then realized she had the desire and the ability to
try for another team medal. Besides, her husband had never seen her
compete.
</P>
<P>
   But it took Miller a couple of days to work up the nerve to tell
coach Steve Nunno.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I would ask him to train me and he would laugh and
that would be the worst feeling ever, and he didn't,'' Miller said.
``He said, `Do you know what it means? Do you remember how hard it
was?'''
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu, meanwhile, had been embroiled in a well-publicized
Houston emancipation case against her parents. She moved to
Cincinnati in January to train with coach Mary Lee Tracy and lives
with her mother and sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I've been through it, it's not as overwhelming as it was
when I was little,'' said Moceanu, 18, who has grown about 10
inches since 1996 and is now 5-foot-2.
</P>
<P>
   Dawes, 23, a student at the University of Maryland who has
pursued an acting career, was the last to commit. After starting to
train in February, ``I took a little bit of time off again, because
I wasn't sure if I had it in me,'' she said. By the end of April,
she thought she did.
</P>
<P>
   ``In `96, there was a lot more pressure, just because that was
our peak year,'' Dawes said. ``Now I just want to work hard and
show everyone that I can still do gymnastics well.''
</P>
<P>
   However, she didn't check her scores Thursday. ``I know nothing
that I got in any event,'' she said, quickly adding, ``So don't
tell me.''

GOP OVERHAUL OF PRIMARY SEASON IS KILLED BY BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, on his way here for
a triumphal nomination, ended the last bit of uncertainty
surrounding next week's convention by killing efforts to allow
voters in all states to cast primary ballots that actually counted.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, designed by the Republican National Committee after
this year's nominations were settled in March, was intended to
lengthen the primary system by making the big states vote last.
Under the plan, the smallest states would have held their primaries
in February, small states in March, medium-size states in April and
big states in May.
</P>
<P>
   On May 12, Karl Rove, Bush's chief strategist, told reporters
that Bush had no position on the plan and would have none later.
But Friday morning Rove passed the word to members of the
convention rules committee that the campaign wanted it killed, and
the committee duly voted to kill it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's intervention bluntly brushed aside several months' work
of party leaders to design a new primary system, and there was a
bit of mystery Friday surrounding the Bush camp's reasons. The
people Rove talked to either declined to quote his stated reasons
or dismissed them as implausible. Most members put the last-minute
move down to a desire to have a convention utterly free of
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   One high-level Bush aide said the campaign feared its
re-election efforts would be hindered if a new calendar led states
to shift from primaries to caucuses and state conventions in 2004.
Some rules committee members said Democrats would keep states like
California and New York from changing the dates of primaries,
forcing Republicans in those states to use caucuses. The Bush aide
called caucuses a ``breeding ground'' for trouble. Republican
caucuses often fall under control of the party's most right-wing
elements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karl did express some concern to several members of the rules
committee, saying we were concerned this would put the Republicans
at a competitive disadvantage,'' said Karen P. Hughes, a Bush
spokeswoman. She said the Bush campaign also also had concerns
``that it would limit the number of candidates who are able to
participate in so many places all at once.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was uncertainty about the Bush campaign's purpose,
there was none about its effectiveness. On Thursday, while the
campaign was still neutral, the Republican National Committee voted
92-55 to approve the plan and send it to the Rules Committee. On
Friday, after Rove intervened, the committee voted 66-33 to reject
it. The losers had enough support to bring a minority report to the
floor on Monday, but they said they would not.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   That same firm control, exerted with a slightly lighter rein,
was evident Friday in platform committee deliberations. While
abortion-rights advocates argued, passionately if unavailingly, for
a softening of the party's stance, and conservatives demanded
tougher language on education, neither side had the inclination or
the strength for a floor fight.
</P>
<P>
   After killing the big-states-last plan, the rules committee also
voted down an effort to give the national committee new authority
to negotiate with the Democrats on a system that did not have so
many states voting so early that it resembled a national primary.
</P>
<P>
   Morton Blackwell, a committee member from Virginia, said one
virtue of the Republican Party was that its rules were ``locked in
concrete'' from one convention to the next.
</P>
<P>
   He said if the national committee was given this authority,
which the Democratic National Committee already has, ``we could
have heaven knows what imposed on us from the top.'' That vote was
72-28, even though the Bush campaign took no stand on it.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One evidence of the utter control displayed by the Bush campaign
over the plan to string out the primaries was the unwillingness of
the losers even to complain about it during the meeting. Indeed,
the Bush position was never mentioned, except when Tom Sansonetti
of Wyoming, the chairman of the rules committee, told the meeting
that the Bush campaign had no position. That was minutes before
Rove told him things had changed.
</P>
<P>
   Sansonetti said in an interview that Rove told him the Bush
campaign thought the plan was flawed because candidates would have
to undergo heavy, tiring travel in February, when a dozen very
small states would vote.
</P>
<P>
   That objection, also cited Friday on the Bush campaign plane by
a spokesman, Scott McClellan, had never been raised in any meeting
on the plan, where the early, small-state campaigning was
specifically designed to keep any candidate from dominating all the
early states, and thereby to give underfinanced hopefuls a chance
to make an impression by an early win.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bill Brock, the former senator from Tennessee and former
Republican chairman whose commission produced the plan, said Rove
had given him the same explanation.
</P>
<P>
   David Norcross, a rules committee member from New Jersey who had
been among the plan's most enthusiastic supporters until this week,
said they had raised the travel question with him, too, along with
the problem that some states might face if Democrats blocked any
change.
</P>
<P>
   He said no one from the Bush campaign had mentioned a desire to
avoid a floor fight to him. The closest anyone came to admitting
that motive was when Karen Hughes, a Bush spokeswoman, said,
``Obviously we want out convention to focus primarily on Governor
Bush and his positive proposal for America, but we wanted people to
be heard in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that people had a chance to express a lot of
different opinions about a better way to nominate a president,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Norcross deserted the plan he had once strongly advocated, and
when he moved to kill it in the Rules Committee, he said he was
just reacting to a ``convergence of problems'' around the plan. He
cited travel costs and the fear of big states that they would have
no influence because they would have come last. Blackwell, who
supported the plan, sarcastically praised Norcross for his
``versatility.''
</P>
<P>
   Sansonetti vainly pleaded for the plan, saying that this year
``two-thirds of the states did not have the opportunity to have a
say in the choice of the most powerful person in the world.'' He
said 30 states voted within eight days, and without the new
proposed rules, more would do so next time.
</P>
<P>
   He scoffed at the travel argument, saying ``They are already
traveling all over. If they're not in a primary, they are raising
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Sansonetti argued that the proposed system would leave the
winner uncertain until the end because the big states had more than
half the delegates. That would make every state's votes meaningful,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Tom Rath, a committee member from New Hampshire, disagreed.
He said ``The race ends politically a lot earlier than it ends
mathematically.'' He said that although Bush and Vice President Al
Gore were seen as certain winners after the March 7 primaries, they
did not yet have the majorities of delegates needed for nomination.
Those majorities were reached on March 14.
</P>
<P>
   One floor fight is still possible, and over a subject that was
debated as long as the primary plan. The committee voted to make
all members of the Republican National Committee automatic
delegates in 2004, and foes promised to fight the plan as
``elitist,'' and also because it copied the Democratic practice.

 &HT;    Florida program to settle HMO, doctor feuds
 &HT;    By John Murawski
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Florida is developing what state health
officials believe is the nation's first dispute resolution program
to mediate claims by hospitals and doctors seeking denied payments
from HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   The program, being readied for Jan. 1, was created in response
to long-standing complaints that health maintenance organizations
delay payment or simply don't pay bills.
</P>
<P>
   Now the only alternative for doctors and hospitals, outside an
HMO's internal appeals process, is to sue the HMO.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got a doctor who has $1,000 in claims outstanding
for a while and they're jacking him around, he's certainly not
going to hire a lawyer and pay $20,000 to file suit and get his
$1,000 back,'' said Jeff Scott, a lawyer with the Florida Medical
Association in Tallahassee, which pushed for the program.
</P>
<P>
   Florida requires HMOs to pay undisputed claims within 35 days
and disputed claims within 120 days. The Florida Department of
Insurance has fined two HMOs and the Agency for Health Care
Administration has fined 13 for violating the state's prompt-pay
law.
</P>
<P>
   Managed-care companies agreed to the program this year as part
of a health care package passed by the Florida Legislature.
Massachusetts enacted its own program July 21, which also is going
into effect Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Insurance Commissioner Susanne Murphy said the disputes
are not necessarily the fault of the HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is evidence to support that providers are not always
billing correctly,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Florida program, the arbitrators, who have yet to be
chosen, will be paid by the disputing parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state requires the loser to pay the cost,'' said Elfie
Stamm, a senior management analyst at the health agency's Bureau of
Managed Health Care.
</P>
<P>
   The costs will be apportioned, so that if a doctor seeks $1,000,
but is awarded $500, the doctor and the HMO will split the cost.
Refusal to pay the cost within 35 days is subject to fines of up to
$500 a day.
</P>
<P>
   The next step for the Florida program is creating regulations to
govern the program. The Agency for Health Care Administration,
which is responsible for operating the mediation program, hopes to
have rules ready next week for publication Aug. 14. The public will
have 21 days to comment.
</P>
<P>
   After the rules are adopted, the state will ask the American
Arbitration As Newspapers

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ When Mayor John F. Street set out in politics 20
years ago, he was a classic insurgent firebrand, living and
breathing protest as he belabored incumbents for neglecting the
outlying neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The urban wheel has come full circle for Street, the powerful
incumbent of the nation's fifth largest city. He now must make sure
that political protesters have their say but not to the point of
disrupting the delegates of the Republican National Convention who
began flooding into town today intent on enjoying the expensive
downtown renaissance of this historic city.
</P>
<P>
   Assorted protest groups, vowing to rally by the tens of
thousands, also began arriving, closely tracked by the mayor's
police aides. The protesters are flocking to this city not so much
for the Republican gathering as for the journalists, who outnumber
the delegates three to one and who are constructing a weeklong
window for the watching nation to get some messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some people who believe their rights are the only
rights,'' Street declared, the Afro hairdo of his protest youth
winnowed and gray, but his instinct for contention still sharp as
he flourishes it in protection of the downtown establishment.
Watching from City Hall, he pondered the ``very small percentage''
of arriving protesters who he estimates may be intent on
confounding the city's hard-earned new image with hit-and-run
street vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't allow people to destroy Philadelphia,'' Street
declared. He had to sigh and smile in confirming a report in George
magazine that, yes, he did refer to some approaching protesters as
``idiots'' and he did vow they would get ``a very ugly response''
for any disruption.
</P>
<P>
   Street said that was merely a light-hearted summary of a serious
point: Philadelphia intends to welcome peaceful protesters and
accommodate nonviolent civil disobedience with professional
nonaggressive arrests. But the city also intends to protect its
hospitality and property from the sort of masked vandals who
marauded through downtown Seattle in December during the meeting of
the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   As the arriving Republicans packed into dozens of new and
renovated hotels, Street contemplated his welcome speech for the
conventioneers. But potential troublemakers never seemed far from
his mind. ``We don't get intimidated,'' the mayor said. ``Besides,
protesters have to eat, too,'' he added, brightening at the tourist
lucre that might be mined. ``They go to restaurants.''
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 56, Street is facing a critical test in his
political career. If the city fails to sparkle during the
convention, he will be blamed. But if the Republicans turn out to
relish this revived and thoroughly Democratic city, he could be
well on his way to re-election despite such haunting problems as
the city's continuing population loss in the face of a failed
school system.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes in having the nation focus on Philadelphia were
underlined two weeks ago with the sensational airing of television
footage of a half-dozen frustrated police officers finally
capturing a fugitive car-jacking suspect and drubbing him with
kicks and punches. Afterward, officials promised subtler tactics
for any convention disturbances.
</P>
<P>
   Street won a tough race in November by a 2-point margin. He
sought to come roaring into office as the successor to the highly
popular Edward G. Rendell, who engineered the downtown revival with
key help from Street as City Council president. Street soon
delivered on a promise to have 30,000 skeletal automobiles hauled
away. He dispatched plows to the humblest streets during a
snowstorm. After a magazine criticized the chubbier residents of
this city of cheese steak and pretzel noshing, the mayor, a predawn
exercise fanatic, rushed to defend his own on the Oprah show.
</P>
<P>
   But Street received poor reviews in his early relations with the
Statehouse as Republicans complained he was obstinate and demanding
in the annual school aid fight. He had also been considered
iron-handed in his council presidency, yet this was a quality that
helped him deliver crucial investment votes on the revival of
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the hospitality-tourism business, you've got to pay to
play,'' said Street, who preferred to dwell on the tourist riches
of Republican visitors rather than on any shortcomings he might see
in their ticket. ``For us, this is a business,'' he said, his tone
firm as a gaveling to order. ``It's time to capitalize on our
investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Born poor on a suburban farm, Street identifies closely with
this city and the possibilities of the underdog to rise up. As a
student, he was rated less than college material by one teacher.
But Street used this as a prod to persist. He ultimately earned a
law degree at Temple University to complement the firebrand
protests of his entry to politics. He now lives in North
Philadelphia, and has four children with his wife, Naomi, a lawyer
and children's advocate in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I began in politics, we didn't have tall buildings; there
was virtually no skyline,'' said Street, sounding genuinely amazed
that the city's stark old silhouette could have vanished. Instead,
a cluster of shiny new office towers and hotels defines a bold,
aspiring skyline. They dwarf the classic century-old City Hall,
where Street will be anxiously governing, watching the intertwined
fates of conventioneers, protesters and his beloved Philadelphia.

CON ARTISTS FLOURISHING WITH GROWTH OF INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 30)  
 By SKIP KALTENHEUSER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Donald and Robyn Rogers, a retired couple living on a fixed
income in St. Johns, Ariz., the opportunity to drive their ``dream
car'' free while earning extra income had boundless appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Their ticket to wheels and riches, they were told in numerous
advertisements spotted on the Internet, would come from the
purchase of a ``consultant membership'' in the Five Star Auto Club
of Poughquag, N.Y. All they had to do was pay an initial fee of
$395 and monthly payments of $100 and recruit others to join.
</P>
<P>
   But the couple, who signed up two summers ago, said they never
received a free lease on the maroon Chevrolet Lumina they had
picked out, and all they earned for the six months spent trying to
sign up new members through postcard mailings, county fairs and
craft shows was $300, or $100 for each of their three recruits.
They said they ended up laying out $2,000 in membership fees,
travel costs and other expenses, including the cost of setting up a
promotional Web site bought through another Five Star member.
</P>
<P>
   They were not alone in their disappointment. After receiving
complaints from other club members, the Federal Trade Commission
last year sued Five Star and its principals, Michael and Angela
Sullivan of LaGrangeville, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   On June 13, Judge Colleen McMahon of Federal District Court in
White Plains, N.Y., agreed with the FTC contention that Five Star's
operation amounted to a pyramid scheme that duped most of its 8,200
members. The Sullivans were ordered to cease operations and to pay
back $2.9 million to members. They were also banned for life from
all multilevel marketing businesses. Their lawyer, Michael Meth of
Benjamin Ostrer &AMP; Associates in Chester, N.Y., said he planned to
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The move against Five Star is part of an effort by the trade
commission to detect and eliminate get-rich-quick schemes on the
Internet. The agency said that it had received 18,600 consumer
complaints of Internet fraud in 1999, compared with fewer than
1,000 just two years before, and that accusations of online abuse
now account for about one in four fraud complaints. The National
Consumers League in Washington estimates that the average victim of
Internet fraud lost $580 last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is proving a con artist's gold rush,'' said Len
Hansen, a journalist from Durango, Colo., who used a research
fellowship to investigate various schemes. ``Con artists are quick
to embrace new communications technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   By typing in ``get rich quick'' on any search engine, consumers
can plug into a variety of Web sites guaranteeing huge profits if
they invest some money or get others to do the same: ``Make $50,000
per month!'' ``Take home a six-figure income.'' ``Earn a 50 percent
return on your money.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts in fraud detection say the Internet provides scam
artists, who used to operate through old-fashioned ``boiler rooms''
with rented phone lines and dozens of cold callers, with a new
cloak of anonymity while making it easier to lure larger numbers of
victims worldwide. Well-constructed Web sites give the appearance
of being above board, which was what helped convince the Rogers to
invest in Five Star.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought that a Web site, up for all to see, was a badge of
legitimacy,'' said Rogers, 60, a retired child-care provider and
school custodian, who was a novice Internet user looking for ways
to supplement her fixed income when she came across the Five Star
site. ``Because of our remote location, it seemed key for building
our business,'' she said of the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen said that as more people went online, ``con artists can
hit their marks faster and cheaper than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As scam operations set up shop around the world,'' he added,
``law enforcement and victims will not find justice comes easy.''
</P>
<P>
   To attack the problem, the FTC has organized ``surf days,'' in
which dozens of law enforcement agencies collectively surf the Net
looking for questionable sites. Some 22 such events have been held
over the last four years, the largest and most recent from Feb. 28
to March 10 and called ``GetRichQuick.con.'' Bringing together 150
consumer and law enforcement organizations in 28 countries on five
continents, it yielded 1,600 suspect sites.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen says many Net schemes are aimed at older people on fixed
incomes and unsophisticated young adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``My favorite come-on is: `Wow. So easy, my children could do
it,''' he said. ``You have to wonder why something so sure-fire is
urgently shared with tens of thousands of strangers. It's an old
saw, but in or out of cyberspace, if it sounds too good to be true,
it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick Ortwein, a 20-year-old student at Mesa College in San
Diego, bought into the Five Star idea in June 1998. Dreaming of a
red Ferrari, he bought a $395 membership and sent out recruiting
ads on the Internet while a friend spent time designing a Web site
geared to college students. But Ortwein, who said he failed to
recruit anyone during his one-year membership and never received
his dream car, abandoned his effort after he was unable to contact
anyone at the company. He said he never got more than a telephone
recording.
</P>
<P>
   Meth, the Sullivans' lawyer, says Five Star ``simply grew too
fast and got away from Michael Sullivan.'' He said Five Star had
many satisfied customers and had offered refunds to those who were
unsatisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Ames Kohm, a lawyer for the FTC, countered that ``customer
satisfaction and cooperation must be loosely defined since well
over 90 percent of the members lost money and 98 percent of people
eligible for a free car did not get one, which is what one would
expect from the math of any pyramid scheme this blatant.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the FTC's largest Internet cases involved the Equinox
International Corp. of Las Vegas. Three months ago, the company
agreed to a settlement that would use an estimated $40 million in
assets to pay back the thousands of recruited distributors who lost
money trying to sell health and beauty product lines and water
filtration products, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Many people do not complain about losing money on get-rich
Internet schemes, Kohm said, because they are too embarrassed or
blame themselves for their failure to achieve marketing goals.
``They don't understand that they were always up against impossible
odds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, 70, a retired employee of the Apache County treasurer's
office in Arizona, said the worst part of the ordeal was knowing
that his credibility was hurt, and that the three people he and his
wife had recruited, including their son, lost money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though we tried very hard,'' Rogers added, ``we're glad we
weren't more successful.''

COMMENTARY: DON'T WORRY, BE HAPPY! 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK RICH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The press is bored. The public is bored. Even Dick Cheney looks
bored. It wasn't until George W. Bush chose a man who makes Brian
Lamb seem like Jerry Springer that I fully appreciated the sheer
genius of his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   What Bush recognizes is that at this crisis-free moment of
maximum American contentment and minimal American political
involvement, relentlessly beatific imagery and oratorical Muzak
really can carry the day. Repeat ``compassionate conservatism,''
``a tone of civility,'' ``inclusion,'' ``tolerance'' and ``heart''
often enough and no one's going to look too hard at the fine print.
Especially if you're posing in ``inclusive'' photo ops worthy of a
Benetton campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Cheney nomination is the perfect proof. Democrats are loudly
labeling him an extremist, and they're not wrong. If you are one of
only 21 members of Congress who voted against regulating cop-killer
bullets _ or one of only eight against the Clean Water Act _ that
puts you, by numerical definition, at the extreme end of the
political spectrum. No less an authority than Newt Gingrich said
this week that Cheney's record was ``slightly more conservative''
than his own.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even as Democrats cite these votes ad infinitum _ Cheney
was against a resolution calling for the freeing of Nelson Mandela,
despite his efforts to fudge the issue now _ where will it get
them?
</P>
<P>
   The nonideological swing voters likely to decide this election
take one look at Cheney, or catch one monotonous sound bite, then
promptly trance out and forget what the Democrats are barking
about.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's wife, Lynne, once wrote a novel about a vice president
whose death was kept secret, and while this scenario may not be
literally true in the case of her husband, it is metaphorically so.
The mild, round, expressionless Cheney is like a deadening cushion
that will soften, absorb or deflect any rhetorical weapons that Al
Gore might hurl at him _ much as Bush's mastery of
don't-worry-be-happy theatrics has ever since his campaign made its
sole major slip-up to date, the detour to Bob Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor has even managed to play down his role as the
country's lord high executioner by suppressing the smirk and
invoking the deity once Gary Graham was dead.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, frustrated by both Bush's affable image and the small
target offered by his slim resume in public life, claim to be
ecstatic about gaining Cheney as a fatter target. If so, they are
delusional _ or at least hopelessly out of touch with the culture
in which this campaign is unfolding.
</P>
<P>
   In a time of what Jesse Jackson has aptly named ``prosperity
fatigue,'' more Americans care about who is going to be voted off
the island on ``Survivor'' or who will succeed Kathie Lee Gifford
on the Regis morning ticket than who will be the next vice
president. After ``Survivor,'' just in time for the debates, come
the Olympics, another distraction from what is already proving a
stealth election year.
</P>
<P>
   This month 43 percent of Americans told pollsters they wouldn't
watch the GOP convention _ a rise from 23 percent in '96. A Pew
survey shows that the number of those thinking ``quite a lot''
about the election is also down steeply from the same summer
juncture of both '96 and '92. ``Even most registered Republicans''
are unaware that their party's convention is looming, according to
Harvard's Vanishing Voter survey.
</P>
<P>
   This is a boon to the Bush campaign. Contrary to the
conventional wisdom, it was a plus, not a minus, when the Cheney
announcement was knocked off the evening news lead by the Concorde
crash and the collapse of the Mideast peace talks. A few seconds of
Bush and Cheney in a warming Prince-Hal-and-Falstaff pose served to
convey the campaign's desired message, with no time left for
dissonant interference.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for the convention next week. Programmed to be as
soothing as a Claritin commercial _ even Clinton-bashing is on mute
_ the GOP spectacular in Philadelphia will defy in-depth network
coverage. If channel surfers glimpse a snapshot of the
inclusiveness, that's good enough.
</P>
<P>
   And that's all most of them will get: Such is the state of
convention coverage that on Sunday Tom Brokaw headlines a panel at
Philadelphia City Hall titled ``Is There a Future for On-the-Air
Televised Conventions?'' that (at two hours) is itself scheduled to
run longer than the slots the big three broadcast networks have
allotted to the convention in prime time most nights.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' hope that TV might sight some GOP fisticuffs next
week can be safely pronounced dead. The compassion pageant will
rise from monotony only in the unlikely event that the campaign
unchains Lynne Cheney, who tends not to be as on-script as her
husband. A sometime occupant of Pat Buchanan's chair on
``Crossfire,'' she wraps the moralistic certitude of Laura
Schlessinger in a humorlessness that might make America nostalgic
for Marilyn Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is the traditional civil war over abortion likely to
disturb the peace. The religious right can gloat this year, not
thunder, since Cheney is actually to the right of Bush on the issue
_ no easy feat.
</P>
<P>
   As for that small band of potentially noisy pro-choice
Republican leaders, most I've spoken to this week are ready to
declare a truce for a mere pat on the head _ a couple of sentences
professing tolerance for their views in a platform that continues
to call for the outlawing of all abortions.
</P>
<P>
   They aren't getting even that, but don't expect any drama.
Hardly had the Cheney announcement dashed pipe dreams of a Tom
Ridge or George Pataki than some pro-choicers began retreating to
the line that Bush is OK because he has promised not to make a
pro-life stance a ``litmus test'' for Supreme Court nominees.
</P>
<P>
   That's a flimsy straw to cling to, given that the governor's
favorite sitting justices are the vehemently anti-choice Clarence
Thomas and Antonin Scalia and that his appointee as the top health
official in Texas, Dr. William Archer, is not only anti-choice but
against giving teen-agers birth-control information that might
prevent unwanted pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   But as Susan Cullman of the Republican Pro-Choice Coalition
points out, the Bush campaign is betting that its disciplined focus
on education ueber alles and equally disciplined silence about
abortion will neutralize his anti-choice stance to busy suburban
voters.
</P>
<P>
   And she may be right. A single photo op with a few hand-picked
homosexuals papered over Bush's career-long failure to speak up for
civil rights for gay people. Should anyone bring up his
noncompassionate record on AIDS _ in fact a nonexistent record in
his first five years as governor of a state with the fourth-highest
caseload _ a hospital visit could turn the tide.
</P>
<P>
   To learn the genesis of this campaign technique, look not to old
Reagan-Bush strategies but to Dana Milbank's recent Washington Post
account of Bush's stint as owner of the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The salesmanship used to boost that struggling baseball
franchise seems a blueprint for the campaign. To ensure favorable
press coverage, Bush flattered reporters and gave them ``a great
press box.'' Though catering to the rich by adding a profusion of
luxury boxes to his new stadium, he hired an architect to
camouflage the class distinctions from the hoi polloi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not so sure you can segue from baseball to a presidency,''
Bush said modestly to Milbank, ``but there are some lessons about
management, about developing a strategy. Baseball is a marketing
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore is in the marketing business too, but his frenetic style
and frequent changes of costume are all wrong for this
easy-listening time. He's a manic stickler for details going up
against a calm stickler for generalities.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's best hope may be that Bush is as complacent
as the sure victor the GOP nominated in Philadelphia 52 years ago,
Thomas Dewey.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore is no Harry Truman. Plain speaking is not, shall we
say, his forte, and his attack rhetoric merely plays into the
Republicans' hands by paradoxically making him, not Bush or Cheney,
seem more like a slashing politician of the despised Gingrich era
in Washington. Expressing his frustration with the Bush campaign's
success in theatrics while on the stump this week, Gore told the
crowd, ``You and I know this is not about show business.''
</P>
<P>
   What country does this guy think he's living in?

JAPAN'S PLAN TO WIDEN WHALE HUNT PROVOKES OBJECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS to fix hed)  
 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite strong objections, Japan plans to sent its whaling fleet
into the North Pacific on Saturday to hunt sperm whales and Bryde's
whales, two rare and little-understood species, along with minke
whales, a more common variety.
</P>
<P>
   It is acting under a research program that is opposed by many
countries and by private environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   An international moratorium on commercial whaling took effect in
1986, but under a provision that allowed some killing for
scientific research, Japan began harvesting several hundred minke
whales a year. The meat has been sold to Japanese consumers, for
whom it is a delicacy.
</P>
<P>
   That effort has been criticized by many countries as commercial
whaling by another name, but the annual take of minkes was largely
tolerated by other governments because the species is abundant.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, Washington and London reacted with anger after
Japan said it would harvest two species that were nearly hunted to
extinction by fleets of factory ships in recent decades. President
Clinton and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain have been
prominent critics of the expanded hunting.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly vexing to the Clinton administration was the
resumption of plans to kill sperm whales, the type immortalized in
``Moby-Dick.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really an aggressive move by Japan,'' said Rolland
Schmitten, the deputy assistant secretary of commerce for
international affairs, after a meeting with Japanese officials at
the White House. ``We let them know that we opposed this at the
highest level. These whales do not have to be killed for the
science. We were prepared to work with them on nonlethal ways to
collect the same information.''
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese officials agreed to reduce the total harvest to 100
whales from a planned take of 160, administration officials said.
But the rarer species were not dropped from the plan.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said Clinton would consider using trade
sanctions to try to dissuade Japan from carrying out its whaling
plan. They said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright planned to
discuss the matter on a visit to Japan on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Japanese Embassy in Washington issued a statement
saying the purpose was to study the diet and ecology of the
animals. The statement said sperm and Bryde's whales would be
included ``because their populations are relatively abundant and in
good condition.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision comes three weeks after the International Whaling
Commission, a 55-year-old group of former and current whaling
countries, rejected the Japanese plan to expand its scientific
whale hunt to include the new species.
</P>
<P>
   The group's scientific committee said that Japan's research plan
was flawed and that most of the data could be obtained without
killing whales.
</P>
<P>
   P.J. Crowley, a spokesman for the National Security Council,
said, ``While they are technically allowed under international law
to do this, it's our view that the world is moving in one direction
in terms of conservation and Japan appears to be moving in a
different direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Several private environmental groups said that while a few sperm
whales have been hunted sporadically by aboriginal groups around
the world, this would be the first large-scale harvest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision by Japan is a slap in the face of President
Clinton, Prime Minister Blair and many others around the world who
have been working to persuade Japan to cancel its plans,'' said
Fred O'Regan, president of the International Fund for Animal
Welfare, which studies whale populations.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmental groups said they feared that the Japanese
move could unravel a consensus that with a few exceptions had ended
large-scale whaling. Norway hunts minke whales, and Finland and
Iceland have conducted research on whaling in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Mott, vice president at the World Wildlife Fund, said,
``This hints at a return to the kind of factory ship whaling that
was responsible for the near-extinction of many species of whales
in the first palce.''

A DOT-COM SENDS IN THE MARINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For Release Sunday, July 30) 
 By RANDALL LANE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Charles M. Peck, introduced earlier this month as the
new chief executive of Theglobe.com, looks as if he stepped out of
the pages of ``The Organization Man,'' with his graying,
short-cropped hair, herringbone sports coat and Marine Corps
demeanor. His resume could induce somnolence in all but the most
open-minded Silicon Alley denizen: salesman for Xerox, executive at
Levi Strauss, PepsiCo and Booz Allen &AMP; Hamilton, in-house
strategist for the New York Stock Exchange, Viacom, Standard &AMP;
Poor's, and most recently, the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants.
</P>
<P>
   So what is this one-man Conference Board doing at what was once
the highest of highflying Internet companies, one with a stock
chart whose plummet now resembles a lunar re-entry? ``People are
tickled,'' Peck, 54, said in an interview at Theglobe.com offices
on lower Broadway in Manhattan. ``I've already received hundreds
and hundreds of e-mails. But I don't think it should surprise
anybody _ it's a good fit.''
</P>
<P>
   What many do not appreciate about his blue-chip background, Peck
contended, is his willingness to tackle a challenge. He grew up the
son of a Coast Guard officer, moving among Japan, Hawaii, Ohio and
New York, and broke up his college studies at the State University
of New York at Albany with a two-year stint in the Marines. His
career has a similar mission-to-mission rhythm, working with the
troubled divisions of otherwise profitable giants. ``While I was
operating under a corporate umbrella,'' he said, ``there was the
same entrepreneurial pressure _ profit or perish.''
</P>
<P>
   Rarely has that choice been more acute than at his newest
company, a network of sites that link users by common interests.
Run since its inception by its founders, Todd Krizelman and Stephan
Paternot, both now 26, Theglobe.com became Wall Street legend for
its 1998 initial public offering. The stock soared 900 percent on
the first day. The fall has been sharp, too _ from $40 in April
1999 to around $2 now. ``It's funny how an IPO can brand a company
for life,'' said Jordan Rohan, an analyst for Wit SoundView, an
online investment banking firm. ``They draw a disproportionate
amount of attention. They are a true lightning rod.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the company called in the marine. From its roots in a
Cornell University dormitory room, Theglobe.com, aimed primarily at
twenty-something professionals, had styled itself as the epitome of
young, cool dot-com corporate culture.
</P>
<P>
   Tellingly, in the official announcement of Peck's arrival,
company management used many terms that it defied just two years
ago, squeezing ``seasoned Fortune 500 executive,'' ``30 years of
experience'' and ``proven track record'' into the first sentence
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Krizelman and Paternot said in January that they would step
back, remaining full-time as vice chairmen. A few weeks later, Peck
was contacted by the executive search firm Heidrick &AMP; Struggles.
``It came out of left field, but then I found it intriguing,'' he
recalled. He was impressed that even an old-economy war horse like
himself was familiar with the brand, and that his son, roughly the
same age as the two founders, knew the product and history.
</P>
<P>
   Paternot, meanwhile, remembers being disarmed by Peck's sense of
humor and entrepreneurial streak, especially considering his age
and stodgy corporate background. ``Him making this move tells you
what his character is like,'' Paternot said.
</P>
<P>
   A four-month courtship ensued, one that mirrors Peck's
no-nonsense style: no snowboarding trips or drinking marathons,
lots of sit-down meetings and negotiations. He wound up taking a
pay cut from his current job, offsetting that with stock options.
``Both sides were buying and selling,'' he said. ``All of us needed
to do our due diligence.''
</P>
<P>
   Peck found a company that has burned through $86.5 million,
including an $8.9 million loss in its last reported quarter (not
counting a one-time acquisition cost), on sales of $7 million. The
company says it has about $30 million left.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts and investors have questioned its business model,
notably its reliance on ad sales, which account for two-thirds of
revenue. Peck has indicated, however, that he plans to expand and
diversify the company, not reinvent it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hypothesis is that the expense side has been very well
managed,'' he said. ``And because the model is highly scalable, we
need to grow the revenue side of the business.'' He has said that
he is not abandoning the company's advertising-based strategy _
and, in fact, sees great opportunity for it internationally _ but
he intends to supplement it by selling Theglobe.com's
community-building software and expertise as a tool for corporate
trainers and associations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Associations are communities _ they'll wind up in jeopardy if
they don't come up with ways for members to communicate over the
Internet,'' he said. In other words, said Peck, who previously
served as senior vice president of the country's largest trade
group for accountants, if the American Medical Association doesn't
get wired, it could be undermined by the likes of WebMD.
</P>
<P>
   But Rohan, one of the few analysts still following Theglobe.com,
says it should rethink its whole plan. ``There are other businesses
going after that strategy _ it's a fiercely competitive space and
the barriers to entry are unclear,'' he said. ``I think
revolutionary change is in order.''
</P>
<P>
   Peck, who does not start officially until Tuesday, allows that
he will need two months to get his arms around the company's
problems. But he does not foresee any culture clash, waxing poetic
about his stint at the short-lived New York Air 20 years ago, when
he left his plush office at Booz Allen to move into a hangar at La
Guardia Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Theglobe.com's offices _ an extension of its founders with its
casual dress and Ping-Pong tables in the lounge _ represent just
another mission. ``I haven't played Ping-Pong with them yet,'' he
said. ``But I'm sure I will.''

SPORTS COLUMN: TIME HAS RUN OUT FOR MORA
</HEADLINE>
  By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Melvin Mora leaned against a gray wall in Shea
Stadium Friday afternoon, holding up the wall, bracing himself.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old Mora learned that he had been traded to the
Baltimore Orioles along with Mike Kinkade, Lesli Brea and Pat
Gorman for Mike Bordick.
</P>
<P>
   The normally unflappable Mora had a pained look on his face.
This one hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't ready for this,'' he said. ``I didn't know they were
going to trade me.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Mora had to sense something was up. Ever since Rey
Ordonez fractured his forearm in May there were calls for everyone
from Joe Tinker to Barry Larkin. Mora was tossed into the fire at
shortstop and turned in mixed results: a stronger bat than Ordonez,
a weaker glove. He was learning on the job but he wasn't learning
fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of those classic cases of a team not being able to
wait.
</P>
<P>
   Mora said, ``You play more and more and more, you're going to
get better, better, better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets didn't, and do not have the luxury of time.
</P>
<P>
   Mora's problem is that for all last year's heroics and
versatility, the Mets never saw him as an everyday player. They saw
him as an every-way player. He played second base, third,
shortstop, center field, left and right.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager, Friday introduced the
trade by saying, ``Utility infielder, Melvin Mora.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Melvin Mora,'' Phillips said. ``He's a very good player
and a very versatile player and a good contributor on a good team.
Melvin did the best he could.''
</P>
<P>
   But the new guy is a solid, everyday shortstop, an All-Star
shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes all of the routine plays and oftentimes the
spectacular player,'' Phillips said. ``He gives us the stability
that was lacking. Bordick brings stability to the left side of the
infield.
</P>
<P>
   Mora said he and manager Bobby Valentine had a long
heart-to-heart conversation. ``He told me that I helped him go 12
games over .500,'' Mora said. ``He said, `The only thing I can say
is thank you, because it was a hard situation when we lost Rey
Ordonez, but you were there.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mora talked a lot about his relationship with Valentine. He
praised the manager for giving him an opportunity, for talking to
him about the facts of life in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the one who told me baseball is hard,'' Mora said. ``He
was the one who was always right behind me every time. When he said
something was going to happen, it happened. He never lied to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine didn't tell Mora that he was going to be traded,
though when critics were sniping, Valentine reminded Mora that this
was New York and this was a pennant race.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a guy like Melvin,'' Valentine said, ``the most difficult
thing he had was this idea that he had never been in the big
leagues before, he had never been a full-time shortstop before and
people wanted to hold him to a standard that was unlike the
standard they held Rey to his first year as a shortstop.''
</P>
<P>
   Mora wondered why he couldn't have the same room to learn from
his mistakes, the same latitude. Valentine had to explain to Mora
that that was then, this is now. The higher expectations, which
Mora helped to raise during last season's playoffs, narrowed
everyone's margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conversations we had were just the idea of understanding
that life and our life in baseball is not always fair, and don't
expect it to be fair,'' Valentine said. ``That was hard for him to
understand. He's not the pennant race. He's Melvin Mora. All he is
is this player out there learning this position, playing
shortstop.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Mets this was a day of tradeoffs: heart-and-soul player
for rock steadiness. Melvin Mora has been around the baseball world
and back.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just one more thing,'' Mora said. ``One more
challenge. Here, I go to another place and make myself ready to
show a lot of people that I'm an everyday player.''
</P>
<P>
   You heard a lot about stability Friday night at Shea Stadium.
Not excitement. Not inspiration. Stability at short.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets made the right move on paper _ a no-brainer, as they
say _ but much of what a Melvin Mora brings to the game cannot be
measured in a box score.
</P>
<P>
   But come the playoffs in October, when the outcome of series are
often determined by intangibles, we'll see how good the trade looks
then.

BUSH WANTS VOTERS TO KNOW WHO HE IS 
 

</HEADLINE>
 MISSION-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGDALE, Ark. _ George W. Bush launched his final journey
toward becoming the Republican presidential nominee Friday by
establishing the convention goal: introduce himself to millions of
voters who are just now tuning into the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just let people know who I am,'' Bush said when asked for the
mission of his convention. ``I hope they know I'm a decisive, firm
leader who has good judgment and is ready to lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign aides realize that while many Americans may know
who Bush is, they still do not know what he stands for; for many he
remains a distant figure. The campaign hopes the 3,900-word speech
he delivers next Thursday in accepting the GOP presidential
nomination will change that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all been reminding ourselves that while Gov. Bush has
been out on the campaign trail for the last year, year and a half,
making hundreds maybe even thousands of speeches ... but this one
speech next Thursday will be the time many Americans tune in and
hear him speak for the first time,'' said Bush spokesman Karen
Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we are very mindful that the convention is a very important
moment and that the speech is an important moment.``
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said Bush has been practicing his speech before
teleprompters and has video-taped it so the staff can look for ways
to improve it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a leadership speech,'' Hughes said. ``He will talk about
the fact that we have a unique moment in our nation's history to
address some problems before they become crises for our children.''
</P>
<P>
   She said there will be a focus on what Bush proposals on
education and tax cuts mean for Americans. She said there also will
be some ``comparing and contrasting'' to the administration of
President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive
Democratic presidential nominee. Hughes said one of those issues
will be a lack of action on modernizing Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   While the convention is designed to let Americans get to know
Bush better, it also will be a venue to re-introduce Bush's choice
of running mates, former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Since his selection on Tuesday, Cheney has been under a barrage
of criticism from Democrats for votes he cast while representing
Wyoming for a decade in Congress, votes that have been portrayed as
anti-women, anti-gay and anti-environment.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about Cheney have so pervaded the campaign that U.S.
Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., began at Springdale High School by
asking, ``Did Governor Bush make the right decision in picking
Secretary Cheney as his running mate?``
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 2,000 Republican loyalist shouted back, ``Yes!``
</P>
<P>
   Hughes dismissed the Democratic criticism, while also chiding
the news media. She said presumptive Democratic nominee Vice
President Al Gore will have a difficult time finding a running mate
with Cheney's experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've really put them in a box. I know that's not the way some
of your reporting has gone, but when you think about it, I want you
to picture, I want you to picture a Democrat nominee measuring up
to the experience and stature of this man,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Thursday he would be ``mulling over'' his choice for a
running mate while on vacation this coming week. Gore will spend
his time at Figure Eight Island, N.C. with wife Tipper, and other
family members in the home of friends Parker and Becky Overton of
Greenville, N.C. He won't be hosting any potential running mates on
the island, he said, and won't meet here with Warren Christopher,
who his heading up his search committee.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Methodist University political science professor Cal
Jillson said next week's GOP convention will give Bush an
opportunity to deliver his campaign message to the American public
``unobstructed.'' But Jillson said it also will be important for
Bush to reverse the negative publicity Democrats have generated
about Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs an opportunity for Dick Cheney to reintroduce himself
to the American public,'' Jillson said. ``The Democratic opposition
research was far superior to the Bush campaign's preparation to
respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls have shown Bush to be widening his lead over Bush
among likely voters. A CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll, released
Thursday, found the Republican ticket with an 11-point lead, 50
percent to 39 percent, among likely voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush defended his selection of Cheney in speeches in Springdale
and later in Joplin, Mo. He told the Springdale audience that he
wanted a vice president who was ready to be president.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said a tough campaign lies ahead: ``We're going to fight
every single day in every single state for every single vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush-Cheney pre-convention tour from Texas to Philadelphia
is scheduled to go through six battleground states: Arkansas,
Missouri, Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania.

 &HT;    Cheney's Wyoming roots run deepBy Kevin Robbins
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CASPER, Wyo. _ The peak touches the sky more than a half-mile
above the Natrona County seat. The range is millions of years old,
squeezed like an accordion when the dinosaurs died, and now it
looms hard over the city and the river and the basins that seep
petroleum oil.
</P>
<P>
   Casper Mountain spreads as far as a man can see. Right in the
middle of it is Casper, where in 1954 a family from Nebraska bought
a single-story house on Texas Place. Richard and Marjorie Cheney
hauled their children to wind-blown Wyoming and the east side of
town. Their picture window faced the street. Through the windows in
back rose the steep north face of Casper Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney was a boy then.
</P>
<P>
   Fame came later, after the Friday night football heroics and the
poker games with the other lettermen, after Boys State and student
council, after an awakening at Yale and a return home, after a
stint as a union utility groundman. Was there another way? The
nature of national politics meant that Cheney had leave Casper to
become what he is today, which is a nominee on the Republican
ticket for vice president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   So the fame arrived when Cheney became a White House chief of
staff at 34, and when he became known as a unfailingly conservative
in Congress, a measured man who spoke of less government and frugal
spending and a freer market. He found fame in his convictions,
which, regardless of what people thought of them, people respected.
Fame came to Cheney when ran a faraway war. He is noted for his
calculating mind and his command in knowing what makes the world go
round and who makes it so. There is a deceiving pattern to it all:
the fame came when he left Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   But, say those who know him, the rise of Richard Bruce Cheney
has much to do with where he is from.
</P>
<P>
   His family came to Casper from Lincoln, Neb., when Cheney was in
his early teens. His father was an official with the U.S. soil
conservation office. His mother raised the three Cheney children
and volunteered.
</P>
<P>
   Casper was a different place then. The Salt Creek oil field
north of town kissed the town with prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Their neighborhood was new.
</P>
<P>
   The Cheneys purchased an 800-square-foot ranch house that looked
like all the rest, had the same young box elders and Chinese elms
in the yards. Their neighbors were lawyers, geologists, former
soldiers with GI Bills. Their streets were curved. Their cross
street, Trigood Drive, looked like it would run right into the face
of Casper Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were full of ourselves,'' said Robert Penney. ``We thought
we could do just about anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Penney bought a house two lots away from the Cheney home, when
the oil boom brought him from Oklahoma. Years later, he became an
activist in the Democratic Party, but just as the Cheneys kept
their politics quiet, so did he. ``In those days, people didn't
talk about their political affiliations very much,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The boys in the neighborhood played baseball on summer days
while their fathers worked and their mothers made homes.
</P>
<P>
   Marjorie Cheney knitted sweaters for the newborns at the only
hospital in Casper. She loved to fish from the banks of Alcova
Lake, and so did her husband, but not as much. The couple played
golf together at the municipal course. They never joined the
country club.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't that kind of people,'' said Vivian Kammerer.
``They never were.''
</P>
<P>
   Kammerer and her husband Reuben met the Cheneys almost three
decades ago, when they, too, moved to Casper from Nebraska. The two
families were members at the First United Methodist Church.
</P>
<P>
   They spent their evenings playing bridge, cooking supper for
their families, discussing the topics adults discussed in the 1950s
in Wyoming: The weather. The neighborhood. The kids. Cheney's
father was the quieter one, a man who, like his sons, weighed his
words before he spoke them. Cheney's mother was more effusive, like
his sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``His mother was very proud of him,'' Kammerer said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the church was where the funeral for Marjorie Cheney
was conducted below the stunning, century-old stained-glass
Resurrection Window. Her husband's funeral was there six years
later. Both deaths were front-page news.
</P>
<P>
   But their values still live. They shaped their two sons and
daughter, family friends say.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's parents came from a time when sincerity meant more than
status, wisdom more than wealth. The Cheneys raised their children
with precepts as sturdy as the deep granite at the core of Casper
Mountain. People say a lot about trust, integrity and inner
strength when they talk about Cheney. They say those same words
about Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney and his friends learned to fish on the North Platte
River, whose cold water rushes down from the Rockies and carries
magnificent rainbow trout. They taught themselves to ski during the
winters. When it got too cold outside, they retreated to someone's
home and played poker or watched boxing on television. They obeyed
the law. They studied. They excelled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just typical of the 1950s in Casper,'' said Joe Meyer,
a childhood friend and now Wyoming's Secretary of State.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney sailed through Natrona County High School, home of the
Mustangs and the Fillies, a building where he and Gov. George W.
Bush last week launched their campaign. Cheney and a tight group of
friends were part of the football team that marched to the 1957
state championship. Cheney played halfback and linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a really good class: good people, smart people, people
destined to go on to bigger and better things,'' said David
Nicholas, a classmate who later was Cheney's best man at his
wedding.
</P>
<P>
   His teachers elected Cheney to Boys State. He was president of
his senior class. An alumnus of Yale University noticed and
encouraged Cheney and a second promising student to go to college
in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were obvious choices,'' said the alumnus, Thomas Stroock.
``They were both students. They were both athletes. They were both
leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   They both went. And after a year and a half at Yale, they both
left.
</P>
<P>
   Stroock, who later served as ambassador to Guatemala during the
Bush administration, was disappointed. Still, he supported Cheney's
decision. ``Don't get your education in some place where you're not
having a good time,'' Stroock said he told him.
</P>
<P>
   So Cheney returned to Wyoming, to his home at the foot of the
mountain. He enrolled at a community college between downtown and
the peak. A union official helped Cheney get work as a groundman
for utility contractors.
</P>
<P>
   That official, a passionate Democrat named Carl Brown, had a
special interest in Cheney. Brown's niece, Lynne Anne Vincent, had
been dating Cheney since high school, where Vincent was an
A-student and Homecoming Queen her senior year.
</P>
<P>
   They were married in the summer of 1964. They recited their vows
at a Presbyterian church the Vincents attended. At that moment, the
young man from Casper with a foundation as strong as rock found
himself suddenly strengthened, enhanced and better prepared to
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Schoolmates remember Vincent as one of the brighter students in
her class. She was bound to do well, they say, and by extension so
were those around her. Her parents _ her father was an engineer,
her mother a deputy sheriff _ ``expected a lot from Lynne,'' said
Norma Brown, whose sister Edna was Lynne's mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``She came through.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney finished at Casper College, where he now is among an
author, a veterinarian, a rodeo cowboy and a naval aviator and
others as the school's 15 distinguished alumni. He earned his
bachelor's and master's degrees at the University of Wyoming. In
1966, he enrolled at the University of Wisconsin, and with Casper
Mountain disappearing behind him as he and his wife moved east, he
left Wyoming again.
</P>
<P>
   They would not return for more than a decade. Their Casper would
change for good.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble visited the oil fields. By the late 1970s, the derricks
had begun to deplete the Salt Creek anticline, which in the 1920s
was the healthiest supply of oil in the United States, eventually
surrendering 600 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
   When Cheney returned to Wyoming, after an appointment as chief
of staff to President Gerald Ford and other federal government
positions, he won the 1977 Republican primary to run for an open
Congressional seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did have a few things going for him,'' said Democrat
William Bagley, Cheney's opponent in the 1978 general election.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's credentials for federal office were sound. He knew
Washington. He had worked in the Office of Economic Opportunity,
the Cost of Living Council and the Nixon and Ford administrations.
And he was a Republican in a Republican state.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney outspent Bagley two-to-one on the campaign. The race was
clean, Bagley said, and there were none of the scathing tactics
that tarnish contemporary elections. The candidates even
cooperated.
</P>
<P>
   Bagley remembered calling Cheney to suggest they eliminate
outdoor campaign advertising. Though Cheney had more billboards,
and more money to spend on them, ``he went along with it,'' Bagley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney trounced Bagley on the Nov. 7, 1978. In Natrona County,
Cheney got 78 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   That began Cheney's six consecutive terms as a representative
from Wyoming. He retired from Congress in 1989, the same year
President Bush appointed him as Secretary of Defense. A year later,
he helped to conduct the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ``That institutional memory is an important thing'' to Cheney's
prospects as vice president, said his longtime friend, Laramie
attorney David Nicholas. ``I can't emphasize enough the value of
having that kind of acumen.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney left his cabinet post in 1993. He and his family returned
to Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   They purchased a slate-floored home on a golf hole in Jackson.
The National Western Stock Show and Rodeo named him ``Citizen of
the West.'' He joined the boards of Proctor &AMP; Gamble and US West.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, during the hunt for a Republican candidate to
challenge President Clinton, his name surfaced. But Cheney publicly
dismissed himself from speculation. Late that summer, he joined
Halliburton Co., an international oil company in Dallas. He moved
to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He never sold the house in Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   He had left Casper and the mountain that accompanied him through
youth, left that with the six terms he spent representing his
district. His parents lived in the house of his boyhood until his
mother died and his father, who suffered congestive heart failure,
was moved to assisted living. They never left Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney still escapes to the house in Teton County. He fishes the
rivers of Wyoming and skis its slopes. He serves on an advisory
board at the University of Wyoming. He returns for speaking
engagements and visits with relatives on his wife's side. He came
back to Casper when the federal building there was named for him.
He was there last week, stumping in the gymnasium of his old high
school below the 8,300-foot-peak of Casper Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   ``So Dick has maintained his Wyoming ties,'' said his friend Ann
Tollefson, who met Cheney in college.
</P>
<P>
   With 481,000 residents and three electoral votes, those ties
mean little to election of 2000. But no one here seems concerned
with numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an exciting time for all of us in Wyoming,'' said
Republican Gov. Jim Geringer. ``We recognize how special Dick is to
us and we're willing to share that with the rest of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the rest of the country can judge for itself how Wyoming
raises a man.

   CAMDEN, N.J. _ It cannot be easy for the Dorrance family to read
the newspapers these days. In headline after headline, one food
company after another has committed to a sale or a merger, leaving
the descendants of John T. Dorrance, the chemist who invented
condensed soup more than a century ago, with an agonizing decision:
Should they sell Campbell Soup Co., which has been in the family's
hands for three generations but is now struggling? Or should they
hire new management to revive flagging sales of its chicken noodle
and tomato soups and Pepperidge Farm cookies and perhaps become an
acquirer itself?
</P>
<P>
   Despite its status as family-controlled company, Campbell has
been managed over the last decade to emphasize the quarterly
results favored by Wall Street analysts and large outside
investors. Under its energetic chief executive, David W. Johnson,
Campbell boasted ever-fatter profit margins and a stock price that
climbed nearly sixfold in roughly eight years, to more than $60 a
share in 1998, just after he left.
</P>
<P>
   But those gains did not last long after Johnson handed over
management of the company to Dale F. Morrison in 1997. In recent
years, consumers have increasingly turned away from Campbell's
familiar red-and-white cans to soups that seem fresher and easier
to open and prepare. As overall sales of canned soup have
flattened, Campbell has lost business to cheaper private-label
brands and, more recently, its nemesis, Progresso. And competitors
like Nabisco have nibbled away at its Pepperidge Farm cookie and
cracker business.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, with many rivals joining forces and gaining clout with
supermarket chains, the threat to Campbell has grown. ``The
fundamentals of the business seem to be putrid,'' said Art Cecil,
an analyst for T. Rowe Price, the mutual fund company, which owns
shares in Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   Cecil is not alone. Campbell's stock now trades at $26.4375,
down 56 percent from that 1998 peak. For the fiscal year ended last
August, the company earned $724 million on sales of $6.4 billion,
but more recently, the results have deteriorated. Earnings fell 14
percent in the quarter ended in April, compared with the period a
year earlier. Despite all the merger talk, only one Wall Street
analyst is now recommending the stock.
</P>
<P>
   The value of the Dorrance family's own holdings has dropped by
more than $7 billion, to $6 billion. And when Morrison resigned in
March, the Dorrances turned again to Johnson, 67, who had retired
as chairman the previous July and had spent his new-found leisure
time climbing Mount Kilimanjaro and traveling to the North Pole.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of the dismal stock performance and the frenzy
of industry consolidation appears to be forcing the family, which
owns just over half the company's stock, to reconsider Campbell's
independence. No question, a turnaround would be lengthy _ and
costly. Perhaps giving a clue to the future, the Dorrances
surprised Wall Street in June, when they appeared willing to sell
Campbell for about $35 a share to Bestfoods, which was fending off
the overtures of Unilever. It was only after Unilever prevailed
that Bestfoods' plans to buy Campbell were dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``When have the Dorrances had enough?'' asked Ken Harris of
Cannondale Associates, a consulting firm, who said he believes the
company must find a partner. ``The clock is definitely ticking.''
</P>
<P>
   The family _ Dorrance's nine grandchildren _ is hardly an
activist group. The last Dorrance to run the company was Dorrance's
son, John T. Jr., who was chairman for more than two decades until
1984. In part, the company has been a victim of changing tastes,
but critics say that Campbell _ as the Dorrances watched _
benefited from years in which the company improved its earnings by
cutting costs and stinting on development and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the cylinders is working right now,'' said David
Kolpak, an analyst with Key Asset Management, who faults Campbell
and Johnson in particular, contending that they raised prices too
aggressively and failed to invest wisely in brands. ``A lot of that
they have themselves to blame.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the family members returned phone calls seeking comment.
But former executives and others who know the family said they had
persuaded Johnson to return as chief executive to help them decide
what to do.
</P>
<P>
   The company has also hired an executive search firm,
SpencerStuart, to find a permanent replacement for Morrison.
(Nabisco's chief executive, James Kilts, is one name favored by
analysts.) A choice is likely to be made by year-end _ unless
Campbell is sold.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered across the country, the grandchildren appear to prefer
pastimes like riding horses to managing the family business. As
they have gone separate ways, they have not remained particularly
close and do not necessarily have the same opinions. The Dorrances
``are very much going to look to David to try to get out of this,''
said Terry Bivens, an analyst with Bear Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   As one former Campbell executive put it, ``David is like a
honorary family member.''
</P>
<P>
   Widely heralded as one of the industry's best managers, Johnson
may find that his own reputation is also very much at stake. In a
recent interview at Campbell's headquarters here _ a building that
is 40-odd years old and in a depressed neighborhood _ Johnson was
quick to point to portraits of Dorrance in the chairman's and
founders' rooms, as well as a lone Andy Warhol painting _ his
Campbell's tomato soup can, of course. Appearing comfortable in his
role as strategist, Johnson expressed enthusiasm at being called
back to duty.
</P>
<P>
   True to form, Johnson showed impatience with the notion that the
company must eventually be sold, arguing that ``only dead fish swim
with the current.'' He acknowledged that there was tremendous
pressure from Wall Street to consider a combination _ likening the
environment to ``a sailor going off the warship in port: they're
looking for a friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Campbell would not be panicked into action. ``We're
trying very, very hard to fight back,'' he said, emphasizing that
the company had not given up. ``I don't think for a second we're
rolling over.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell could remain independent, he said, and would weigh its
options carefully over coming months. Citing Wrigley, the Chicago
chewing-gum maker, as a successful family company, he said, ``I
think we are still in control of our destiny.''

 &HT;    Cheney's Wyoming roots run deepBy Kevin Robbins
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CASPER, Wyo. _ The peak touches the sky more than a half-mile
above the Natrona County seat. The range is millions of years old,
squeezed like an accordion when the dinosaurs died, and now it
looms hard over the city and the river and the basins that seep
petroleum oil.
</P>
<P>
   Casper Mountain spreads as far as a man can see. Right in the
middle of it is Casper, where in 1954 a family from Nebraska bought
a single-story house on Texas Place. Richard and Marjorie Cheney
hauled their children to wind-blown Wyoming and the east side of
town. Their picture window faced the street. Through the windows in
back rose the steep north face of Casper Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney was a boy then.
</P>
<P>
   Fame came later, after the Friday night football heroics and the
poker games with the other lettermen, after Boys State and student
council, after an awakening at Yale and a return home, after a
stint as a union utility groundman. Was there another way? The
nature of national politics meant that Cheney had leave Casper to
become what he is today, which is a nominee on the Republican
ticket for vice president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   So the fame arrived when Cheney became a White House chief of
staff at 34, and when he became known as a unfailingly conservative
in Congress, a measured man who spoke of less government and frugal
spending and a freer market. He found fame in his convictions,
which, regardless of what people thought of them, people respected.
Fame came to Cheney when ran a faraway war. He is noted for his
calculating mind and his command in knowing what makes the world go
round and who makes it so. There is a deceiving pattern to it all:
the fame came when he left Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   But, say those who know him, the rise of Richard Bruce Cheney
has much to do with where he is from.
</P>
<P>
   His family came to Casper from Lincoln, Neb., when Cheney was in
his early teens. His father was an official with the U.S. soil
conservation office. His mother raised the three Cheney children
and volunteered.
</P>
<P>
   Casper was a different place then. The Salt Creek oil field
north of town kissed the town with prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Their neighborhood was new.
</P>
<P>
   The Cheneys purchased an 800-square-foot ranch house that looked
like all the rest, had the same young box elders and Chinese elms
in the yards. Their neighbors were lawyers, geologists, former
soldiers with GI Bills. Their streets were curved. Their cross
street, Trigood Drive, looked like it would run right into the face
of Casper Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were full of ourselves,'' said Robert Penney. ``We thought
we could do just about anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Penney bought a house two lots away from the Cheney home, when
the oil boom brought him from Oklahoma. Years later, he became an
activist in the Democratic Party, but just as the Cheneys kept
their politics quiet, so did he. ``In those days, people didn't
talk about their political affiliations very much,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The boys in the neighborhood played baseball on summer days
while their fathers worked and their mothers made homes.
</P>
<P>
   Marjorie Cheney knitted sweaters for the newborns at the only
hospital in Casper. She loved to fish from the banks of Alcova
Lake, and so did her husband, but not as much. The couple played
golf together at the municipal course. They never joined the
country club.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't that kind of people,'' said Vivian Kammerer.
``They never were.''
</P>
<P>
   Kammerer and her husband Reuben met the Cheneys almost three
decades ago, when they, too, moved to Casper from Nebraska. The two
families were members at the First United Methodist Church.
</P>
<P>
   They spent their evenings playing bridge, cooking supper for
their families, discussing the topics adults discussed in the 1950s
in Wyoming: The weather. The neighborhood. The kids. Cheney's
father was the quieter one, a man who, like his sons, weighed his
words before he spoke them. Cheney's mother was more effusive, like
his sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``His mother was very proud of him,'' Kammerer said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the church was where the funeral for Marjorie Cheney
was conducted below the stunning, century-old stained-glass
Resurrection Window. Her husband's funeral was there six years
later. Both deaths were front-page news.
</P>
<P>
   But their values still live. They shaped their two sons and
daughter, family friends say.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's parents came from a time when sincerity meant more than
status, wisdom more than wealth. The Cheneys raised their children
with precepts as sturdy as the deep granite at the core of Casper
Mountain. People say a lot about trust, integrity and inner
strength when they talk about Cheney. They say those same words
about Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney and his friends learned to fish on the North Platte
River, whose cold water rushes down from the Rockies and carries
magnificent rainbow trout. They taught themselves to ski during the
winters. When it got too cold outside, they retreated to someone's
home and played poker or watched boxing on television. They obeyed
the law. They studied. They excelled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just typical of the 1950s in Casper,'' said Joe Meyer,
a childhood friend and now Wyoming's Secretary of State.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney sailed through Natrona County High School, home of the
Mustangs and the Fillies, a building where he and Gov. George W.
Bush last week launched their campaign. Cheney and a tight group of
friends were part of the football team that marched to the 1957
state championship. Cheney played halfback and linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a really good class: good people, smart people, people
destined to go on to bigger and better things,'' said David
Nicholas, a classmate who later was Cheney's best man at his
wedding.
</P>
<P>
   His teachers elected Cheney to Boys State. He was president of
his senior class. An alumnus of Yale University noticed and
encouraged Cheney and a second promising student to go to college
in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were obvious choices,'' said the alumnus, Thomas Stroock.
``They were both students. They were both athletes. They were both
leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   They both went. And after a year and a half at Yale, they both
left.
</P>
<P>
   Stroock, who later served as ambassador to Guatemala during the
Bush administration, was disappointed. Still, he supported Cheney's
decision. ``Don't get your education in some place where you're not
having a good time,'' Stroock said he told him.
</P>
<P>
   So Cheney returned to Wyoming, to his home at the foot of the
mountain. He enrolled at a community college between downtown and
the peak. A union official helped Cheney get work as a groundman
for utility contractors.
</P>
<P>
   That official, a passionate Democrat named Carl Brown, had a
special interest in Cheney. Brown's niece, Lynne Anne Vincent, had
been dating Cheney since high school, where Vincent was an
A-student and Homecoming Queen her senior year.
</P>
<P>
   They were married in the summer of 1964. They recited their vows
at a Presbyterian church the Vincents attended. At that moment, the
young man from Casper with a foundation as strong as rock found
himself suddenly strengthened, enhanced and better prepared to
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Schoolmates remember Vincent as one of the brighter students in
her class. She was bound to do well, they say, and by extension so
were those around her. Her parents _ her father was an engineer,
her mother a deputy sheriff _ ``expected a lot from Lynne,'' said
Norma Brown, whose sister Edna was Lynne's mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``She came through.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney finished at Casper College, where he now is among an
author, a veterinarian, a rodeo cowboy and a naval aviator and
others as the school's 15 distinguished alumni. He earned his
bachelor's and master's degrees at the University of Wyoming. In
1966, he enrolled at the University of Wisconsin, and with Casper
Mountain disappearing behind him as he and his wife moved east, he
left Wyoming again.
</P>
<P>
   They would not return for more than a decade. Their Casper would
change for good.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble visited the oil fields. By the late 1970s, the derricks
had begun to deplete the Salt Creek anticline, which in the 1920s
was the healthiest supply of oil in the United States, eventually
surrendering 600 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
   When Cheney returned to Wyoming, after an appointment as chief
of staff to President Gerald Ford and other federal government
positions, he won the 1977 Republican primary to run for an open
Congressional seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did have a few things going for him,'' said Democrat
William Bagley, Cheney's opponent in the 1978 general election.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's credentials for federal office were sound. He knew
Washington. He had worked in the Office of Economic Opportunity,
the Cost of Living Council and the Nixon and Ford administrations.
And he was a Republican in a Republican state.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney outspent Bagley two-to-one on the campaign. The race was
clean, Bagley said, and there were none of the scathing tactics
that tarnish contemporary elections. The candidates even
cooperated.
</P>
<P>
   Bagley remembered calling Cheney to suggest they eliminate
outdoor campaign advertising. Though Cheney had more billboards,
and more money to spend on them, ``he went along with it,'' Bagley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney trounced Bagley on the Nov. 7, 1978. In Natrona County,
Cheney got 78 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   That began Cheney's six consecutive terms as a representative
from Wyoming. He retired from Congress in 1989, the same year
President Bush appointed him as Secretary of Defense. A year later,
he helped to conduct the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ``That institutional memory is an important thing'' to Cheney's
prospects as vice president, said his longtime friend, Laramie
attorney David Nicholas. ``I can't emphasize enough the value of
having that kind of acumen.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney left his cabinet post in 1993. He and his family returned
to Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   They purchased a slate-floored home on a golf hole in Jackson.
The National Western Stock Show and Rodeo named him ``Citizen of
the West.'' He joined the boards of Proctor &AMP; Gamble and US West.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, during the hunt for a Republican candidate to
challenge President Clinton, his name surfaced. But Cheney publicly
dismissed himself from speculation. Late that summer, he joined
Halliburton Co., an international oil company in Dallas. He moved
to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He never sold the house in Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   He had left Casper and the mountain that accompanied him through
youth, left that with the six terms he spent representing his
district. His parents lived in the house of his boyhood until his
mother died and his father, who suffered congestive heart failure,
was moved to assisted living. They never left Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney still escapes to the house in Teton County. He fishes the
rivers of Wyoming and skis its slopes. He serves on an advisory
board at the University of Wyoming. He returns for speaking
engagements and visits with relatives on his wife's side. He came
back to Casper when the federal building there was named for him.
He was there last week, stumping in the gymnasium of his old high
school below the 8,300-foot-peak of Casper Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   ``So Dick has maintained his Wyoming ties,'' said his friend Ann
Tollefson, who met Cheney in college.
</P>
<P>
   With 481,000 residents and three electoral votes, those ties
mean little to election of 2000. But no one here seems concerned
with numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an exciting time for all of us in Wyoming,'' said
Republican Gov. Jim Geringer. ``We recognize how special Dick is to
us and we're willing to share that with the rest of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the rest of the country can judge for itself how Wyoming
raises a man.

 CAMDEN: our destiny.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But former executives, analysts and others paint a picture of a
family that may find it difficult to pull together to do what is
needed to turn around the company. Some recall that in 1989, after
Dorrance's death, his children, nephews and nieces, disappointed by
the company's performance, were bitterly divided over whether to
sell out.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute eventually led to a reorganization that put five
family members _ three Dorrance children, John III, Bennett and
Mary Alice Malone, and two of their cousins, George S. Strawbridge
Jr. and Charlotte Weber _ on the board. Two other cousins, Hope van
Beuren and Dorrance Hamilton, formed a voting trust and added
Charles H. Mott, who is not a relative, to the board to represent
their interests. John III, who has since sold his shares in the
company, is no longer a director.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at Campbell in 1990, Johnson, a colorful Australian who
had achieved tremendous success at Gerber Products, managed to
settle the question of a sale by driving up the stock price.
Investors, including the Dorrances, were thrilled at his
revitalization of the company _ he slashed costs and brought
discipline to its operations, laying off thousands of employees and
jettisoning mediocre businesses. The family basked in dividends
that now approach some $200 million a year, allowing them to remain
aloof from the business.
</P>
<P>
   The grandchildren, and their children, are informed about the
company, Johnson said; they attend presentations about its strategy
and ask questions. ``In this instance,'' as opposed to 1989, he
added, ``the family has stayed involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Family members, who have seen the company go through difficult
times before, are willing to take a long view, he said. The
company's board ``is more committed to the long run than anybody
could imagine because of its special history,'' he said, a
reference to the family's commitment to Dr. Dorrance's legacy and
their experience a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   But family members also leave major decisions to others. ``They
are not that engaged,'' said one former executive, who described
them as ``never really interested in the details.'' With Johnson as
chief, they had come to expect only good news, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from flirting with Bestfoods, Campbell has remained
stubbornly single as General Mills picked Pillsbury and Philip
Morris won Nabisco in the new round of food mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Nabisco had often been mentioned as a possible partner for
Campbell, and Johnson agreed that the two companies shared strong
cash flows, which would let a combined company take on large
amounts of debt and generate strong earnings. But he dismissed the
notion that such a deal would have been smart. If Campbell had
merged with Nabisco, he said, Campbell's soup business would have
stopped playing a vital role.
</P>
<P>
   Though there may be no shotgun marriage _ at least not yet _
Campbell would be willing to consider some kind of merger,
according to Johnson. He said the company would stay independent
not as a goal in itself but only if it was the best way to increase
shareholder value. Perhaps as big a consideration, analysts and
consultants suggested, is that the family is likely to want stock,
not cash, for any sale, for tax reasons, but would be interested in
owning a smaller portion of another entity. ``I would imagine,''
Johnson said, ``that the family would see having a significant role
as being of continued importance.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little consensus about which company may be the right
partner. Heinz is often mentioned, given its similar businesses and
strong management. But the two companies have been bitter rivals,
and buying Campbell may not be the challenge Heinz wants. Unilever
might consider a run after it has digested Bestfoods, and Nestle is
also a possibility. Procter &AMP; Gamble may even make a bid.
</P>
<P>
   If Campbell decides it go it alone, it is far from clear that it
will be successful. The company still needs a chief executive,
since Johnson is unlikely to tarry too long. While Campbell still
controls 74 percent of the nation's soup volume, its unit sales
continue to drop, falling 4 percent in the last year. The news
hasn't been good in cookies or crackers, either: unit sales
declined 5 percent for Pepperidge Farm cookies, and crackers were
off slightly, according to Information Resources Inc. Campbell's
other major brands include Godiva, Prego and V8.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big danger is you do all of this, and it may not work,''
said Bivens, the Bear Stearns analyst.
</P>
<P>
   And, clearly, consumer tastes have changed. ``They basically
have the Maxwell House of soup,'' said John McMillan, an analyst at
Prudential Securities, referring to the once-dominant brand of
coffee that fell victim to changing preferences and chains like
Starbucks that spare consumers the bother of brewing their own.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its well-known brands and dominant market position,
Campbell has not kept up with the times, consultants say. It was
slow to offer ready-to-eat soup and only recently gave consumers
easy-to-open cans.
</P>
<P>
   The company is ``missing innovation,'' said Gary Stibel, founder
of the New England Consulting Group.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy that served Johnson so well before _ cutting costs
and selling low-margin businesses _ is unlikely to do the trick
this time. Although Campbell recently announced more layoffs, there
is nearly universal agreement that the company must increase
volume. ``We squeezed every nickel in the cost structure,'' said
one former executive, who described the task ahead as ``a big, big
marketing turnaround.''

 CAMDEN: marketing turnaround.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Johnson says his earlier success at Campbell was based on ``more
than just squeezing and hacking.'' But analysts and consultants say
the company appears to have invested too little in the development
and marketing of its brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really haven't come up with anything that has sparked the
soup business,'' said Kolpak of Key Asset Management.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson conceded that Campbell has not backed the right
initiatives. ``I think we have tried too hard for growth,'' he
said. In introducing products, the company took a scattered
approach that cannibalized some of its core business. Its
introduction of microwaveable soup, for example, hurt its basic
soups. Campbell is now focusing its efforts, introducing, for
example, a new tomato noodle soup in the United States that took
off in Australia and rolling out easy-to-open, ready-to-serve cans
of the popular red-and-white varieties.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also said marketing campaigns had largely been
unsuccessful. ``Our talk to the consumer became more fragmented,
wasn't as strong, wasn't as clear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chastened, Campbell is charting some initiatives _ called the
fight-back plan _ for this fall. It will devote more effort to big
sellers like chicken noodle soup, trying to appeal to consumers by
adding more meat and reminding them of soup's value.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you will see this fall is advertising that is very proud,
very confident and that celebrates our core equities,'' said F.
Martin Thrasher, the president of Campbell North America.
</P>
<P>
   While Johnson did not rule out buying another business, like
Keebler, a large acquisition may not happen anytime soon. In the
opinion of one former executive, Campbell will wait until it finds
a new chief, because Johnson ``is not the guy who will ride it
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also said many potential purchases would cost too much
in the current environment, although Campbell could probably take
on the necessary debt.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell has a long way to go to prove itself again, Johnson
acknowledged. ``To return to grace and to run to Wall Street's loud
cheering,'' he said, ``will take a back-to-back couple of years of
initiatives and innovation and re-proving our vitality and
strategies.'' And it will be at least early next year, he said,
before the company can demonstrate the success of some of its
latest efforts.
</P>
<P>
   At Gerber, which also struggled after Johnson left, the story
ended happily once the company was bought in 1994 by what later
became Novartis. Descendants of the company's founder, Frank
Gerber, profited by tens of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   At Campbell, Johnson said, the ending will depend on the people
running the company. ``Talent is and leadership is, and what you
build in the company is how you are going to ensure the future,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is now up to Johnson to decide whether Campbell should sell,
and even some of his sharpest critics refuse to count him out in
finding a way to regain shareholder value. ``While Johnson left his
predecessor with a bad hand,'' said McMillan, the analyst, ``every
place he's gone, he's won.'' The Dorrances are certainly betting on
him.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The announcement this month that De Beers Consolidated Mines
would retreat from its 70-year-old practice of controlling prices
by hoarding the world's diamonds and become more selective in where
it buys its gems sent reverberations through diamond markets from
Antwerp to Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   De Beers disclosed that, among other things, it planned to
reduce its $3.9 billion stockpile of uncut diamonds to about $2.5
billion by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   But the strategic change in the way the world's largest trader
of uncut diamonds does business does not mean consumers will see a
sudden abundance of engagement rings at cubic zirconia prices,
industry analysts say. De Beers wants to quell concerns about the
provenance of its diamonds, they say, but also wants to build
demand for them by advertising the stones as branded luxuries in a
new and aggressive campaign.
</P>
<P>
   From its trading headquarters in London, De Beers also promised
to cut ties with any of its 125 major trading partners that
trafficked in stones originating in war zones. The partners would
be required to guarantee that they do not.
</P>
<P>
   De Beers, the South African mining company that controls about
two-thirds of the trade in uncut diamonds, has come under
increasing pressure lately, after disclosures that, to help prop up
prices and control supplies, it bought millions of dollars of
diamonds from rebels in Angola to add to the company's bulky
stockpile.
</P>
<P>
   So-called conflict diamonds from warn-torn parts of Africa are
being sold by rebels and some armies to buy weapons; human rights
groups and several world governing bodies have protested. In July,
the United Nations Security Council imposed a global ban on diamond
exports from Sierra Leone, where the stones have helped finance a
brutal war.
</P>
<P>
   Eli Haas, president of ENH International Inc., a diamond trading
company in New York, said last week that he expected to see a
steady decline in the sale of conflict diamonds, which account for
an estimated 4 percent of the market. ``As the new protocols get
into effect, that number will continue to drop,'' he said, adding,
``I don't know that it will drop to zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were less optimistic. One diamond wholesaler in New York
said he was skeptical of De Beers' ability to police traders. ``In
our industry, any way they can make a buck, they will,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the months ahead, consumers are likely to see a profusion of
ads not only telling them that a diamond is forever, a longtime De
Beers slogan, but also asking them to look for the gemstone
equivalent of the union label. De Beers' trading partners _
cutters, polishers and dealers _ were asked to increase their
advertising budgets to promote consumer demand for diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   De Beers diamonds will carry the name Diamond Trading Co., or
DTC, as a guarantee to retailers that the diamonds were mined under
humane work conditions from reputable mines, said Joan Parker, the
director of the Diamond Information Center run by J. Walter
Thompson, the advertising agency for De Beers.
</P>
<P>
   The DTC monogram, with its accompanying logo called the
``forevermark,'' will show up on advertisements, though not
necessarily on the jewelry products themselves. The retailer will
know that the diamonds meet the standards ``and be able to respond
to the consumer when asked,'' Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, jewelry shop owners have not been fielding many
questions about conflict diamonds anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you asked 10 shoppers in a Zales today if they are
concerned about buying blood diamonds, nine of them would say:
`Excuse me? What are you talking about?''' said Kenneth M. Gassman
Jr., a jewelry industry analyst for Davenport &AMP; Co. in Richmond,
Va.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, diamond jewelry sales have risen in the United States
in the last few years, to nearly $25 billion in 1999, about 12
percent higher than a year earlier. Analysts said they did not know
how the new De Beers policies would affect sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``De Beers is selling off its stockpile in a controlled
manner,'' Gassman said. Keeping the supply stable, he added, is
part of the company's venture into ``market-efficient capitalism.''
</P>
<P>
   De Beers will also encourage the use of brand names. While few
diamond makers claim name recognition today, Gassman estimates that
in five years most diamonds will be branded.
</P>
<P>
   That arrangement should mean more profit for both diamond
suppliers and jewelry retailers, Gassman said, because branded
products usually carry higher margins. He pointed to Lazare Kaplan
International of New York, which fetches premium prices for its
Ideal Cuts diamonds that are laser-inscribed with the company's
logo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brands will increase consumer confidence in the diamonds that
they buy _ that they are the quality they are supposed to be,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Beryl Raff, chief executive of Zale Corp., which operates more
than 1,300 jewelry stores, mainly under the names Zales, Gordon's
and Bailey, Banks &AMP; Biddle, said she expected De Beers and its
dealers to pay more attention to consumer trends, ensuring that
retailers get the stones they need for certain promotions or
jewelry lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think from a creativity standpoint, the consumer will win,''
she said.

POVERTY-STRICKEN PHILADELPHIANS SEEK ATTENTION 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LISA TEACHEY 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Just north of downtown and far from the view of
Republican National Convention delegates lies one of the city's
poorest neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Kensington is home to about 10 percent of Philadelphia's
residents, many of whom are homeless, destitute or addicted to
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   It's a place called ``The Badlands'' where:
</P>
<P>
   Children ride bikes on streets littered with shards of glass and
piles of garbage;
</P>
<P>
   Abandoned factory walls _ if still standing _ are covered with
graffiti;
</P>
<P>
   Up to three families share one rundown rowhouse;
</P>
<P>
   Adults gather on front stoops and street corners all day because
there are no jobs;
</P>
<P>
   Vacant lots are used as homeless encampments;
</P>
<P>
   Drug dealers prey on others.
</P>
<P>
   And it's a place convention delegates are not likely to ever
visit, much less hear about from local officials directing them
instead to the sports arena facilities on the south side, the
historic center of downtown and the upscale dining along the South
Street entertainment district.
</P>
<P>
   But in a move to capture the attention of the some of the 15,000
journalists here for the convention, the Kensington Welfare Rights
Union organized tour-guided bus trips through the poverty-stricken
area.
</P>
<P>
   While GOP leaders spent Friday fending off efforts to weaken the
party platform's opposition to abortion and taxes, three yellow
school buses filled with reporters and activists rumbled northward.
</P>
<P>
   While Gov. George W. Bush's camp worked to defeat a proposal to
change the party's nomination structure, welfare rights union
founder Cheri Honkala rallied a group of homeless at a Tent City
near Kensington, the tour's first stop.
</P>
<P>
   Though not the first such encampment to sprout in a vacant lot,
this one is called Bushville as a sarcastic tribute to the expected
Republican presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's elected president our problems are only going to get
worse,'' said tour guide Tamzin Cheshire, just before stopping to
let journalists visit the camp.
</P>
<P>
   Under a large tarp amid about a dozen tents and makeshift
lean-tos, Honkala cried as she talked about the opportunity her
group has this week to get national attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than one-third of the children in Philadelphia live in
poverty,'' she said. ``After the convention the poor people are
going to go back to being the disappeared in America...We've got
one minute, one moment in time to make our voices heard so it's
worth living in a fishbowl right now. If people are ashamed of what
they see they better damn well do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Honkala's group is planning to march through downtown Monday to
the First Union Center, site of the convention, even though the
march was denied a city permit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 income in Kensington is welfare. No. 2 is drugs,''
Honkala said. ``Many in these neighborhoods have no running water,
they have to use the fire plugs to wash. We are very adamant about
the fact ... the only thing we have is our voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Kensington once was the city's industrial center, a blue-collar
neighborhood of factory workers and family-run shops.
</P>
<P>
   But when the factories began moving out, poverty moved in. In 30
years Philadelphia has lost about 250,000 jobs, according to media
reports, and in the past two years has been home to more than
50,000 vacant lots and buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt's Brewery, which once employed 1,400, still occupies an
entire block. But the brick buildings in the abandoned complex have
holes in the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Cheshire said children use the building as a playground because
they have no where else to go. And some families use it as shelter
despite the asbestos seeping from gaps in the structures.
</P>
<P>
   Just blocks away is Elbow Alley, a short street sandwiched
between a salvage yard and a row house where Cheshire said the
junkyard owners buys scrap metal from drug users so they will have
cash to buy his drugs.
</P>
<P>
   There are murals on several buildings, mostly outlets for
neighborhood artists. But for those who cannot afford headstones or
visits to cemeteries, Cheshire said, some of the murals serve as
memorial to friends and family who have died.
</P>
<P>
   Buildings with boarded up windows are on almost every street.
Weeds grow three to four feet tall in many lots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Philadelphia might be a great place to visit. It's not a great
place to live,'' Cheshire said. &QL;

COMMENTARY: BREAKING THE SILENCE
</HEADLINE>
 By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine a country, a democracy, with a domestic program that is
increasingly costly and socially disruptive. The problem it is
supposed to solve has actually grown worse over the years _ but
neither major political party will talk about changing the policy.
</P>
<P>
   That is a picture of the United States and its drug policy. By
any rational test the war on drugs, with its use of the criminal
law and harsh sentences to solve the problem, is a costly failure.
The number of Americans in prison for drug offenses has multiplied
by 10 since 1980, from 41,000 to 458,000. But drugs are more
available than ever, and more young people are using them.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of this political and social disaster the Republican
and Democratic parties offer: silence. Their leaders are evidently
afraid that even discussing different approaches might get them
labeled as soft on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But the silence is about to be broken. In tandem with the
Republican National Convention starting Monday in Philadelphia, and
later with the Democrats, there will be shadow conventions that
discuss the failed war on drugs and two other issues that the major
parties have not solved: campaign finance and the gap between rich
and poor.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain and other politicians brave enough to break
with their parties' wishes will participate. McCain will be the
keynote speaker tomorrow, talking about the idea that makes him
anathema to so many other Republicans: ending the scandal of
campaign money and influence.
</P>
<P>
   The shadow conventions are the brainchild of Arianna Huffington,
the columnist and gadfly. She has moved from the political right
toward the left _ or perhaps to a position of dislike for all
evasive politicians. The shadow conventions will have participants
from all camps.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Campbell of California, the Republican candidate for
Senate against the incumbent Dianne Feinstein, will talk about the
failed drug war. So will another Republican brave enough to
challenge the policy, Gov. Gary Johnson of New Mexico, and the Rev.
Jesse Jackson. Walter Cronkite, the greatly respected former
broadcast newsman, has made a 10-minute video special for the
shadow convention on the cost of the drug war.
</P>
<P>
   The staggering figure mentioned above _ that 10 times as many
Americans are in prison for drug offenses today as in 1980 _ comes
from the Justice Policy Institute in Washington. It has just issued
a report that shows, in fresh ways, some consequences of the war on
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The 458,000 men and women now in U.S. prisons on drug charges
are 100,000 more than all prisoners in the European Union, whose
population is 100 million more than ours. The annual cost of
incarcerating them is $9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 80 percent of drug arrests in 1997, the most recent year
for which figures are available, were for possession. Of those, 44
percent were for possession of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks are overwhelmingly more likely than whites to be
imprisoned for drug offenses, a study by Human Rights Watch showed.
Just 13 percent of regular drug users in this country are black,
but 62.7 percent of drug offenders sentenced to prison are black.
Evidently juries and judges treat offenders less seriously if they
are white.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Policy Institute report found that in 1986, 31 out
of every 100,000 young people in America were put in state prisons
for drug offenses. By 1996 the figure had nearly quadrupled, to 122
per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The institute studied states with higher rates of imprisonment
for drug offenses to see whether that had a deterrent effect. It
found, to the contrary, that states with higher incarceration rates
also had higher rates of drug use.
</P>
<P>
   There are already signs around the country of unease with the
human cost and practical failure of our drug policy. Perhaps the
shadow conventions will move more political leaders to face the
reality recently stated by The Economist of London: ``That
misguided policy has put millions of people behind bars, cost
billions, encouraged crime and spread corruption while failing
completely to reduce drug abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nader has chided me for saying that he has paid little or
no attention as a candidate to the civil liberties record of the
major parties. In fact he has called the Clinton administration's
record ``abysmal.''

THE QUIET ON THE SET IS SOUNDING LIKE THUNDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 30)  
 By BARBARA WHITAKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dressed in a pink tutu with double-decker wings,
Todd Susman and his grouchy persona are trying to change the image
of the tooth fairy forever.
</P>
<P>
   For Susman, a 53-year-old actor, the offbeat role in ads for
Sonicare electric toothbrushes is an opportunity to play a
memorable personality like Mr. Whipple, the vigilant grocery-store
manager of the Charmin commercials, and Clara, who asked ``Where's
the beef?'' for the Wendy's fast-food chain.
</P>
<P>
   But with a strike by commercial actors against advertisers and
agencies entering its 14th week, Susman will not be shooting new
commercials for Sonicare, which is made by Optiva, as scheduled.
Although he knows that the character, and the advertising campaign,
could be jeopardized, he said the risk was ultimately worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advertisers want to change the status quo forever,'' he said.
``They have the money. They have the resolution, and if they can
possibly do it they will.''
</P>
<P>
   As the strike stretches on, it appears to be more and more a
sign of things to come. Movie and television production are already
being accelerated as Hollywood prepares for the possibility of
strikes by screen and television actors as well as writers when
their contracts expire next year.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent newsletter, the Writers Guild of America warned its
members: ``Now is not the time to be buying the biggest house or
the nicest car you can afford. If you have a TV staff-writing job,
begin putting money away now. If you make a feature deal, bank
every penny you can.''
</P>
<P>
   The writers and actors share a key complaint, about their pay
for work shown on cable TV. In the early days of cable, union
representatives say, actors and writers cut special deals below
network rates to help the fledgling industry get off the ground.
Now, they say, it's time for payback. ``Cable has become a mature
cash cow industry, very successful,'' said John McLean, executive
director of the Writers Guild of America, West. ``And we want our
piece.''
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, the disputes arise from the changing face of
television and the multitude of options created by advances in
electronic media, including the Internet. Compensation for work
shown on the Internet is another issue in the contract talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a whole new world here; we'll agree with them on
that,'' said Todd Amorde, chairman of the national strike strategy
committee for the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation
of Television and Radio Artists.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, television was dominated by the three major
networks _ ABC, NBC and CBS. Now, there are seven broadcast
networks and at least 50 national cable networks that are tracked
by Nielsen Media Research, plus many regional channels that are not
even monitored. Until the late 1970s, the three big broadcast
networks captured more than 90 percent of the viewing audience.
That share is now less than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically a different economic model,'' said Tim Brooks,
co-author of an annual directory of prime-time network and cable
shows. ``You get this collision of interests as times change.''
</P>
<P>
   The Writers Guild's contract with producers expires May 1 next
year, followed by the movie and television actors contracts July 1.
No proposals are yet on the table. But union representatives said
they want compensation for the increasing profitability of cable
and of shows that are broadcast overseas. They also want a
guarantee of fair pay for work that appears on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In the strike by actors in commercials, the primary difference
is simple: the actors want to be paid every time an ad is shown on
television, and advertising agencies and marketers want to pay a
flat rate.
</P>
<P>
   On network television, actors who appear in commercials are paid
under a system known as ``pay for play.'' They receive a daily
rate, currently $478.70, which includes the first broadcast. They
are then paid each time the commercial is shown again, starting at
$122.70 and decreasing over 13 weeks to $46.65. On cable, they are
paid $1,014 for the 13-week cyle, no matter how many times the
commercial is shown.
</P>
<P>
   A commercial runs an average of 44 times over 13 weeks on the
networks, according to Amorde. On cable, with more channels and
lower costs for time, he said, advertisers have told him that
commercials run 225 to 233 times over 13 weeks. But he says the
Screen Actors Guild has found some ads that were shown as many as
5,000 times on cable.
</P>
<P>
   Though actors usually spend only a day or two shooting a
commercial, they spend much more time searching for assignments and
auditioning. Apart from celebrities, the most successful actors who
specialize in commercials can earn more than $50,000 in a good
year. But most make just a few thousand dollars and rely on other
jobs for most of their income.
</P>
<P>
   Unions representing commercial actors have proposed a
pay-for-play arrangement for cable at 37 percent of the network
rate.
</P>
<P>
   The Joint Policy Committee, representing advertisers and their
agencies, has proposed to increase the payment for filming a
commercial to $500, followed by a flat rate of $2,575 for 13 weeks
of appearances on network TV. On cable, they have proposed
increasing the rate for 13 weeks to $1,627.
</P>
<P>
   Agreeing on these terms is essential before the negotiators
start dealing with new technologies, said John A. McGuinn, chief
negotiator for the Joint Policy Committee. ``This strike is about
modernizing this contract and bringing it into the Year 2000 so we
can deal with the Internet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators have been finding little common ground. The talks,
which had been suspended, resumed on July 20 after federal
mediators called the two groups back to the table. But the
negotiations quickly broke down again.
</P>
<P>
   Actors want Internet use of advertising included in the
contract, but McGuinn said he had not been authorized to negotiate
in this area. The advertisers and agencies want both sides to study
the issue and meet at least once a year, but they stress that they
do not agree that the unions have a right to negotiate Internet
rates.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A third sticking point involves the unions' desire to verify how
many times a commercial is shown. The Screen Actors Guild says its
survey of 38 commercials uncovered $110,000 in unpaid wages. The
advertising industry proposes joining with the unions to choose a
consultant who can search for the best way to monitor commercials.
Recommendations from a committee representing both sides would be
due 60 days before the expiration of a new contract in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Some advertisers are producing commercials with the blessing of
the actors unions by agreeing to pay what the unions have proposed.
But many other commercials are being made in defiance of the
strike.
</P>
<P>
   The unions, affiliates of the AFL-CIO, are trying to keep the
heat on advertisers. Members are picketing production of nonunion
commercials in an attempt to shut them down. Earlier this month,
the actors picketed major offices of AT&AMP;T, which has been making
commercials using nonunion actors.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the protesters were addressed by labor leaders,
including the AFL-CIO president, John J. Sweeney, and by actors
like Susan Sarandon and Jerry Orbach.
</P>
<P>
   Susman said he had been lucky enough to work during the strike
by providing the voice of a dog in commercials for Laidlaw's
Greyhound bus line, which signed the unions' proposed contract.
Still, he marvels that commercial actors, among the hardest-working
and lowest-paid members of the actors' unions, are bearing the
brunt of the larger struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``How God and luck aligned in this particular situation so that
we are the ones at the forefront of this fight, I will never
know,'' Susman said. ``But we know the fight we're in.''

LAKERS COULD BE PLAYERS IN NEXT WEEK'S FRENZY
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With three days remaining before NBA teams can
officially announce free-agent signings, the clear winners during
the month-long negotiation period are the phone company and rumor
mongers.
</P>
<P>
   NBA general managers are burning the phone lines trying to
consummate complicated deals, and they figure to keep doing so
right up to Tuesday, when the fruits of their efforts can finally
be revealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a game of chess, so to speak, between teams (trying
to make deals) and with representatives of players,'' said Los
Angeles Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak. ``It's been a month
of continuous calls, rumors, and strategy. I'm sure it's something
that, when you look back on it you'd think was fun. But while it's
happening it can be a tenuous, trying process.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the rumors, let's just say some of the speculated deals
currently making the rounds have about as much authenticity as a
World Federation Wrestling match.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the stuff you hear is pretty old and most of it
probably won't happen,'' Kupchak said. ``What does that all mean?
It means we all have to wait (until Tuesday) and see what
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   A few things are certain, however.
</P>
<P>
   The Orlando Magic will add Detroit's Grant Hill and Toronto's
Tracy McGrady as free agents and San Antonio will retain Tim
Duncan, the crown jewel of this year's free-agent class. Meanwhile,
the Chicago Bulls, with millions in salary-cap dollars available
but no one accepting the money, will be hard-pressed to improve on
last year's disastrous finish.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan, the 24-year-old forward, was vigorously pursued by
Orlando but decided to remain in San Antonio, where he and David
Robinson hope to win another NBA title. Duncan reportedly will sign
a three-year contract with the Spurs next week, then sign a much
more lucrative seven-year deal after he has six years of NBA
experience.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear the Lakers will be players in next week's frenzy, but
to what degree remains to be seen. With free agent Glen Rice
destined to leave Los Angeles, the Lakers have reportedly talked to
Charlotte about a complicated four-way deal in which Eddie Jones,
Rice and Detroit's Jerome Williams would wind up in Philadelphia,
the 76ers' Toni Kukoc and Charlotte's Anthony Mason would come to
L.A., and Philadelphia's Allen Iverson and Matt Geiger would go to
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   To complete the trade, Charlotte would get Detroit's Jerry
Stackhouse and Christian Laettner and the Lakers' Travis Knight.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is unlikely for two reasons. One is the Lakers'
reluctance to add Mason to their roster. The other is that the
Pistons have already publicly committed to signing Orlando free
agents Ben Wallace and Chuck Atkins, reducing their cap space and
making it difficult to add Iverson and Geiger in a trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment, L.A. wants no part of Anthony Mason,'' one
source familiar with the situation said. ``(Jerry) West thinks it
would be disastrous.''
</P>
<P>
   That could change, of course, if West decides to step down as
team president as has been widely reported.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte also talked to L.A. about a straight-up deal with Rice
and Jones, but a long-term contract makes Jones a base-year player,
meaning a third team with available cap space must be part of the
deal. Someone like the Clippers or Bulls, although neither seems
inclined to help the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   A more likely deal is Rice going to the 76ers in a swap for
Kukoc, who played under Phil Jackson in Chicago and is familiar
with the triangle offense.
</P>
<P>
   Kupchak said the Lakers are seeking help in the frontcourt,
outside shooting and more size in the backcourt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have needs to address,'' Kupchak said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the frontcourt players the Lakers covet in either
sign-and-trade deals or with their $2.2 and $1.2 million veteran
salary exceptions are P.J. Brown of Miami, Charles Oakley and
Antonio Davis of Toronto, Austin Croshere of Indiana, Kurt Thomas
of New York, Jahidi White from Washington, Bo Outlaw from Orlando
and Adonal Foyle of Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, having already been spurned by Orlando's John
Amaechi, await word on the players they've talked to since the
negotiation period opened July 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how much work you've done, you can't rest easy until
you actually have players signed,'' Kupchak said. ``And that makes
it stressful for people who do this for a living.''

KENNEDY HOSTAGE-TAKING SEEN AS PRICE OF AVOIDING GUNFIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., Nev.)   (SUBS 3rd graf to add attribution; Subs 4th graf to add Commey's
arraignment; ADDS 8 graf at end with details, quotes)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Airport security checkpoints, with their squads of
guards and phalanxes of metal detectors, are considered by most
passengers to be a kind of firewall, designed to stop weapons from
getting anywhere near airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   But airline security officials have long acknowledged that the
checkpoints are really meant to do only part of that job: They are
supposed to detect hidden guns or bombs and provide a system for
alerting armed police officers. If someone brandishes a gun and
tries to force his way past, the officials said, the unarmed
security officers at the checkpoints are not only unable to stop
him, they are not supposed to.
</P>
<P>
   This fact was frighteningly underscored late Thursday night in
Terminal 4W at Kennedy International Airport, when the police said
Aaron Commey, a 22-year-old Milwaukee man, approached a security
supervisor, waved a 10-millimeter automatic handgun, ran around the
metal detectors and dashed directly out an elevated Jetway at Gate
33. He then boarded a National Airlines Boeing 757 set to fly to
Las Vegas and took the pilot and co-pilot hostage, official said.
</P>
<P>
   No one was hurt during the takeover, Commey, who the police said
surrendered peacefully, was ar- raigned Friday on charges of at-
tempted air piracy. Officials at Kennedy airport insisted Friday
that their security procedures had worked as they should have:
Armed police officers responded in less than three minutes, no
shots were fired and hostage negotiators succeeded in persuading
Commey to give himself up.
</P>
<P>
   But to many of the passengers who were boarding the National
Airlines jet, the security system seemed to have left them
shockingly vulnerable. Unlike the security checkpoints throughout
most of the rest of the airport, the checkpoint for the National
Airlines flight was unusually close to the door to the Jetway,
meaning that there was next to no time for flight attendants to
close the door and prevent him from boarding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police came very fast, but there was no security,'' said
Marcus Weiss, one passenger interviewed shortly after the takeover
began. ``The guy just walked right on through. It's really really
strange. The airport security working there weren't armed. They
couldn't do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy airport officials and many other airline security
experts said Friday that the proximity of the checkpoint to the
gate probably had little to do with what happened, because Commey,
pointing a gun, probably could have gone through many other
checkpoints located farther from gates and still made his way onto
a plane.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials agreed Friday that the incident was exactly
the kind that, despite various strategies over the years, has long
been considered virtually unpreventable.
</P>
<P>
   For six years, beginning in 1973 after a spate of hijackings,
security screening points were set up in all the country's airports
and they were guarded by armed police officers. But in 1978, the
Federal Aviation Administration and the airline industry agreed to
discontinue the practice, in part because they considered it more
dangerous than the possibility of a gunman forcing his way through
the checkpoint area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a firing range,'' said Homer A. Boynton, who directed
security for American Airlines from 1981 to 1993. ``There was a
unanimous decision among the people in the airline industry and the
people in the FAA that it was a wise choice to take the armed guard
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Capt. John Torres, the operations captain at Kennedy airport,
said that he believed people could have been hurt if guards had
been armed or had tried to stop Commey.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a potential for a shootout in a crowded terminal with
passengers walking around,'' said Torres, one of the Port Authority
police officers who directed the response to the hostage situation
Thursday night. He added: ``Security did the right thing. They did
not try to take an individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Torres and other officials said, the security guards _
who do not work for the Port Authority but for a private company
under contract to the airlines _ pushed what is known as a covert
button as soon as Commey sprinted past the metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
   The button sounded an alarm that summoned armed Port Authority
police officers. Al Graser, deputy director of the aviation
department for the Port Authority, said that at least one officer
is stationed in each of the six terminals at Kennedy airport.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, officers once were required to respond to a
security checkpoint within one minute in an emergency, but over the
years, as the number of hijacking attempts dropped, the requirement
was relaxed to five minutes, Graser said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, Torres said, the police response time was two
to three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Cathal L. Flynn, the head of civil aviation security for the
FAA, also praised the job done not only by police and security
officers, but also by the flight attendants and pilots, who he said
managed to deal with the situation calmly.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that assessment, the inci- dent is likely to raise
troubling ques- tions once again about the effective- ness of the
private security systems in place at Kennedy and all the na- tion's
airports.
</P>
<P>
   The checkpoints detect an average  &UR; -------------------- &LR;  of
2,000 weapons each year and have been remarkably successful in pre-
venting the hijackings that plagued the industry in the early
1970s, Flynn said.
</P>
<P>
   But the performance of the guards has been a longstanding
concern of federal watchdog agencies. In a re- port released late
last month, the General Accounting Office conclud- ed that a
variety of problems had continued to affect guards' ability to
detect dangerous objects carried by passengers. Although the FAA
does not release the results of tests of security systems, the GAO
said that FAA officials had acknowledged that their own tests of
guards and check- points had shown that they did not work
satisfactorily in detecting dan- gerous objects.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the GAO said the problems were attributable
mostly to a difficult working environment and rapid turnover among
security personnel at many airports. ``Screen- ers are often paid
the minimum wage or close to it and can often earn more at airport
fast-food restau- rants,'' the investigators wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn said the FAA had be- gun to carry out changes to improve
the screening systems, including in- stalling better detection
equipment and creating computer surveillance programs that would
record the se- curity officers' attentiveness and performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to improve the human element; we don't disagree,''
Flynn said. But he also pointed out that no one has been killed
during a terrorist incident on a flight originat- ing in the United
States and attribut- ed that to a successful overall securi- ty
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy airport officials also said that the incident Thursday
night was the only takeover of a plane there in recent memory.

<P>
   NEW YORK_ It happened decades ago, but Sarah Jessica Parker
remembers a horribly embarrassing experience. In the third grade at
the Clifton School in Cincinnati, her teacher called out her name
and she had to go to the front of the line each day to get a ticket
for her free lunch from the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were on welfare,'' recalled Parker, the curly-haired,
slinky star and producer of HBOs ``Sex and the City.'' ``I knew I
was different from the kids who pay for lunch or bring their lunch
from home. It was a stigma thing. I was not the only person
receiving a free lunch, but you are aware.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember my childhood as Dickensian,'' she added. ``I
remember being poor. There was no great way to hide it. We didn't
have electricity sometimes. We didn't have Christmases sometimes,
or we didn't have birthdays sometimes, or the bill collectors came,
or the phone company would call and say, `We're shutting your
phones off.' And we were all old enough to either get the calls, or
watch my mother's reactions or watch my parents shuffling the money
around.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'' included Parker's three older and four younger siblings.
Neither her father, Stephen Parker, then a writer, nor her
stepfather, Paul Forste, a truck driver whom her mother, Barbara,
married when Sarah Jessica was 3{, earned enough to support such a
large family.
</P>
<P>
   Parker has a matter-of-fact tone as she talks of the past; there
is no trace of bitterness. She remembers much about her childhood
warmly and remains extremely close to her siblings and her parents.
But when it comes to money, her harsh childhood experiences
continue to shape her attitudes, making her a conservative
investor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I want most for my children _ I would like for them
to not be aware of money, which means I have been very aware of my
financial situation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Those children _ she is planning to have some of her own someday
soon _ shouldn't have to worry. Today Sarah Jessica Parker is one
of the hottest stars on television. With her megawatt smile
plastered on buses and pay phones across the country, she draws as
much attention as Hollywood icons like Julia Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Though Parker, 35, has been in show business most of her life
and has many film, stage and television credits, the success of the
two-year-old ``Sex and the City'' has catapulted her into a whole
new financial category. Industry executives estimate that her pay _
while still nowhere near as high as for some stars on regular
network television _ is now $100,000 to $150,000 an episode.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Matthew Broderick, is a highly regarded Hollywood
and Broadway actor, but Parker does not want to depend on him
financially. They keep their monetary affairs separate.
</P>
<P>
   Parker says her father once told her that to assure her
financial security, she needed $8 million. Though she would not be
more specific, given her salary from the HBO series and films, she
seems likely to be more than halfway there.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has happened in the past year is extraordinary,'' she
said happily. ``There is not a day that passes that I am not
grateful for the windfall.''
</P>
<P>
   With that capital and earning power, her life is a far cry from
the days when her mother used to buy her and her sisters each two
pairs of shoes a year and dresses at 99 cents each. ``There was a
corporate outlet and you could get Polly Flinders dresses really
inexpensively,'' said Forste, who now lives in Teaneck, N.J., and
teaches nursery school, a career that she had dropped when Sarah
Jessica was 3. ``It was not unusual to get them there or at rummage
sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker says she invests conservatively and worries about the day
when she cannot get work. But her scary financial past and her
current flush state sometimes make for an odd couple.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is why I have such a weird relationship with money,''
Parker said. ``And it is why I can be profligate and super-frugal.
And I think it is rather warped since it comes from this desire to
save, save, save. And on the other hand, I have been working so
hard for 25 years _ why can't I have another pair of Manolo Blahnik
shoes or that bag that I love?''
</P>
<P>
   She shoots ``Sex in the City'' for about six months out of the
year and a feature film during the hiatus. ``Whatever happens to
the stock market, I am making a steady paycheck every week'' while
the series is in production, she said, ``so the tote board gets
bigger, and there is more to spend.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, when she is doing a movie and is on location, she
receives a living allowance in cash each week. That is when she is
most tempted to splurge.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hand you the cash and it's like pop candy,'' Parker said.
``In the good old days, they used to call it `mad money.''' A
recent acquisition, she said, was a second Hermes bag; her husband
had bought her the first as a gift.
</P>
<P>
   But when she is not working, she is nervous about spending.
``Idle hands are the devil's workshop,'' she intoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends know me so well, and they know how terrified I am
of being broke, and they think it is hilarious and humorous,'' she
added.
</P>
<P>
   Parker's fears, however, have considerable basis in her
industry. History is rife with stories of actresses who never got
much work after the age of 45, and Parker is clearly aware of the
odds of surviving in the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the case of the entertainment industry, actresses have this
window, and the window closes every day a little bit more,'' she
said. ``The earnings potential falls and the window is closed, and
I am really cognizant of that. I have no illusions of who I am or
what I look like or what I have to offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker caught the acting bug early. Her mother was infatuated
with the arts, particularly the theater. ``I would like to say that
I was absolutely not a stage mother,'' Forste said. ``But on some
level I was. What the children did was pretty much under our
control. But any of the kids that did not want to act didn't do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Jessica, who began acting professionally when she was 8,
was one of several clan members who loved it. Two of her brothers _
Pippin Parker, a writer, and Timothy Britten Parker, an actor _ are
also in the business.
</P>
<P>
   An early career breakthrough for Sarah Jessica came in 1979, at
the age of 14, when she played the lead in the Broadway production
of ``Annie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was away from all the chaos of the house,'' Parker said.
``It was this really structured environment. And the theater seemed
really nice and disciplined. And they paid me, and I didn't have
any money.''
</P>
<P>
   Her credits range from television's ``Square Pegs'' and ``Year
in the Life'' to the films ``Footloose'' (1984), ``L.A. Story''
(1991), ``Ed Wood'' (1994) ``Honeymoon in Vegas'' (1992) and ``The
First Wives' Club'' (1996). On stage, she has been seen in
``Substance of Fire'' and the Broadway revivals of ``How to Succeed
in Business,'' opposite Broderick, and ``Once Upon a Mattress,'' in
which she starred as the Princess.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In show business, the big money is made in movies, and until now
Parker has never commanded headline-grabbing fees. That was partly
because she has turned down some higher-paying roles. ``I have
never been a big payday person,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The First Wives Club'' had the highest box-office receipts of
any of her movies, but it was not until she played Nell in ``Dudley
Do-Right,'' filmed in 1999, after ``Sex and the City'' had made her
a television star, that she could command more than $500,000 for a
lead movie role, one industry expert said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the choices you make,'' Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with her celebrity status soaring, she would probably get
$1 million or more, several leading agents said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Parker's paychecks are invested pretty conservatively by
firms selected by Frank Selvaggi, a founder of Altman, Greenfield &AMP;
Selvaggi, an accounting firm in Manhattan that advises many
entertainers. Parker's stepfather, who started his own trucking
company in the early 1980's, introduced her to Selvaggi 18 years
ago. They have worked together ever since.
</P>
<P>
   She relies heavily on Selvaggi's advice, which goes well beyond
the selection of money managers. His firm pays her bills, and
Selvaggi, in concert with her agent, Kevin Houvane at Creative
Artists, occasionally counsels her on whether she needs to accept
an offer for film or television work. When a commercial is offered,
for example, ``he might tell me not to do it,'' Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll say: `Be true to yourself. You don't need the money,'''
she added.
</P>
<P>
   Parker has been working 14-hour days lately on ``Sex and the
City,'' leaving her little time for worrying about finances. But
she checks in regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is more active than most people,'' Selvaggi said. ``She
calls me every month to go over her bills and financial statements.
Not that she asks about individual stocks, but if there are big
swings, she brings it up.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Parker bought an apartment in the TriBeCa neighborhood
of Manhattan. In 1997, the year she married Broderick, she sold it
to move in with him and started putting her extra capital to work.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 30 percent to 40 percent of her investment portfolio is
in tax-free bonds. The remainder is in various stocks and mutual
funds primarily handled by McDonald &AMP; Co. and other investment
firms.
</P>
<P>
   Selvaggi and McDonald executives tailored her investment
strategy. ``I sat in a long meeting and listened and looked at a
lot of numbers and pies and graphs and made those conservative
choices,'' Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, Selvaggi said, the investments are in value stocks
like Colgate-Palmolive and Citigroup. He has stayed away from
dot-coms because the approach he has worked out with Parker has
been, as he put it, that ``slow and steady wins the race.''
</P>
<P>
   They put some money into blue-chip technology stocks including
Microsoft, Cisco Systems and Intel, in 1997 and 1998, he said but
not too much, because ``when she was going into the market, it was
very high and shaky.''
</P>
<P>
   Selvaggi said Parker's stock investments have done very well,
beating the 19.5 percent gain of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index last year.
</P>
<P>
   Although some investors think stocks are just as safe an
investment as bonds over the long term, and much better than bonds
at making money, Selvaggi is mindful that a performer's career can
suddenly spiral downward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonds are less volatile,'' he said. ``And sometimes you are
talking about a two- or three-year window when the market is on a
downward slope, but people need capital. If they invest in the
stock market, the capital can drop in value. I make sure they
understand the risk.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like many other people these days, Parker is torn about her
investing style. ``There's a guy on the show who made his mortgage
in one day on his house on some Internet stock,'' she said. ``I
said to him: `Why didn't you call me?' He made $35,000 in half an
hour, which I think is a great gig. I don't do any of that stuff. I
watch the market, and Matthew and I have these conversations like,
`Should we get out?' And I call Frank, and it is so scary, and he
says: `It's OK Stay in.'''
</P>
<P>
   She knows she has missed out on some of the stock market's big
gains in recent years, ``but I feel like it's too late to catch
up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if you haven't written somebody a thank-you note in
months,'' she added. ``You can't begin to do it so late.''
</P>
<P>
   She is not impervious to stock tips. In 1992, when she was
working in Pittsburgh, the hub of U S Air Group, now U &UR;  &LR; S Airways,
she took a shot. ``The guy who did my hair had a boyfriend who
worked at U S Air. He's like: `It's going to merge with British
Air. Get in there.' I called Frank at 6 in the morning and said,
`Buy U S Air.''' She invested about $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   This year, when U S Airways agreed to be acquired, albeit by the
UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines, Parker sold and made $4,000.
About that time, she made her only other independent financial
choice, a $10,000 investment in a restaurant that went out of
business.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband have stayed with the separate financial
advisers they had before they met, she said, and ``we don't discuss
money very much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a rough understanding of what Matthew can and cannot
afford, but there is no reason I need to know how much money he
has,'' she added. ``If and when we have our children, then things
become communal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men, especially, say to me: `You are loaded,' and I say:
`Matthew's money is not my money.' I have to work. I never want
Matthew to feel the pressure to take a job because he thinks he has
to support me.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I asked him about his finances, he would tell me. But I
don't want to know. It is not what keeps me interested in him. I
suppose that if Matthew told me that he wouldn't tell me, I would
feel resentful. But it is the least important thing, because
Matthew has always said that he would take care of me. And I would
take care of him.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple do not have a joint checking account. ``I buy all the
groceries and his clothes and pay for reupholstering the
furniture,'' she said. ``We take each other out to dinner. We do
have a joint credit card and sometimes use it for groceries.''
Broderick pays it.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband live in a Federal-style 1840s brownstone in
Greenwich Village that Broderick bought before they were married.
They rent an old farmhouse in the Hamptons for the summer and, as
Selvaggi put it, can afford do what they like. If they don't talk
about how to make money, they do talk about how to spend it. ``I
bought cheap because that is what my mother did,'' Parker said.
``She would drive 15 miles out of her way to get 15 bags of paper
towels because they were cheaper.''
</P>
<P>
   But Broderick is more prone to ``buy one good knife and then you
don't have to keep replacing it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She says that her husband is very smart about money and that she
has learned from him. At the most practical level, she said, she
would no longer ``buy a used car and keep replacing it over and
over; I would buy one decent car.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Though Parker has loosened up a bit with money, she remains
determined not to repeat her family's financial past.
</P>
<P>
   When Sarah Jessica was 11, the family moved from Cincinnati to
Roosevelt Island in New York City _ then a new mixed-income
community on a piece of land formerly named Welfare Island _ so the
children could do more work in the theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a sort of a caste system,'' she recalled. ``It was a
sliding scale with some subsidized housing.'' The families with the
least money lived in the less desirable apartments. ``We were in
the house closest to the parking lot, and so everybody knew,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure eased as Forste's business did better and the
children grew up.
</P>
<P>
   Parker is ambivalent about the stresses of earning money as a
child in a family that needed it so desperately. In those days in
New York State, there was no legislation requiring that some of a
child actor's earnings go directly into a trust. Nor were there
laws saying how much a child actor could work.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the money the children earned ``was absorbed into the
family,'' Parker said. ``I wouldn't deny anything that I
contributed financially.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, ``if I knew then what I know now, I would have
had somebody outside the family help me manage the money _ an
objective party that would keep things real clean, so that when you
were a teen-ager, you don't feel resentful that you can't at least
keep some of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, she can laugh at the trials of growing up under
such stress and at the complex standards her mother had about what
her children could and could not do.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would never let me work in television,'' Parker recalled.
``She thought it was vulgar and trashy.''
</P>
<P>
   For her mother, ``the theater and ballet were not about money,''
Parker said. ``It was about this grand idea of who we were as a
family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Her role model was Rose Kennedy,'' Parker added. ``She wanted
to raise a family that had grand and important lives. It was weird
because we were living in all this chaos, but her image was
actually a great motivator.'' &QL;

VALDES TRADE COULD BE A COUP, WITH RIGHT ATTITUDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's news-and-views, deals-and-steals edition of The Sporting
Muse:
</P>
<P>
   News: Dodgers welcome back Ismael Valdes with open arms.
</P>
<P>
   Views: OK, maybe we're overstating the reception. But no one hit
him while he was taking a shower, either.
</P>
<P>
   The team and the young pitcher can make this week's trade a real
coup if everyone has the right attitude. The club never should have
traded Valdes in the first place, because he's too young and his
arm too lively. Whether or not he lacks cajones is irrelevant when
you're talking about someone who can give you 200 decent innings a
year at a time when good pitching is an endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes never wanted to be traded in the first place and he hated
it in Chicago, where he had no friends and the unsympathetic Don
Baylor was manager. He should be overjoyed to be back in the
family, and it won't surprise me if he throws a complete game
shutout in his first start.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the team should take it as a clue, too. Obviously,
Dodger CEO Bob Daly hasn't given up on the season, and there are
worse places in baseball to be than Los Angeles. If there's any
sign of a spine in this baseball team, now would be a good time to
show it.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Dodgers G.M. Kevin Malone is still upside down in his
deal with the Cubs, because I'm sure Eric Young would have
contributed more to the 2000 team than setup reliever Terry Adams.
</P>
<P>
   News: Diamondbacks trade for Phillies Curt Schilling.
</P>
<P>
   Views: On the surface, the snakes now have a formidable 1-2
pitching punch, which is a real key considering some contenders
don't have 1, much less a 2.
</P>
<P>
   And should they make it to the postseason, this pair could be
the difference in a seven-game series. But there was a point this
season when Schilling didn't have his usual velocity, indicative of
the kind of arm problems that come and go on a whim. All it takes
is one bad whim, too, to lose a pennant.
</P>
<P>
   The other trades sound more exciting than they are. I don't see
how Mike Bordick, just obtained from Baltimore, puts the Mets over
the top, playoff-wise. Sometimes teams push too many buttons this
time of year. The Rockies and Red Sox exchanged cold bodies, with
Red Sox hoping Rolando Arroyo can suck up some innings in a
scheduled crowded by makeup games.
</P>
<P>
   The Milwaukee-Cleveland deal was intriguing in two respects: the
team owned by commissioner Bud Selig (the Brewers) trade away three
pitchers (Bob Wickman, Steve Woodard, Jason Bere), and the Indians
now can pad their major league record for most pitchers used in a
season. It was 29 before the trade.
</P>
<P>
   News: Baseball makes more trades than NASDAQ.
</P>
<P>
   Views: It's the big names that you always notice when trades are
made on the eve of the deadline, like Schilling, Valdes, Bordick
and Mike Lansing. But there's plenty of proof that the teams
trading vets for a fistful of prospects are the ones who win.
</P>
<P>
   Consider some of these deals from the past few years:
</P>
<P>
   -- Needs bullpen help during a pennant race, Seattle obtained
Heathcliff Slocumb from Boston. The Mariners got Derek Lowe, now
the Sox closer, and Jason Varitek, their everyday catcher.
</P>
<P>
   -- Looking for pitching help, the Mets obtained Kenny Rogers and
Billy Taylor from Oakland. The A's got Terrance Long, now their
starting centerfielder, and Jason Isringhausen, now their closer.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Giants obtained Wilson Alvarez and two other players from
the White Sox two years ago in a deal widely hailed as a mistake by
the Sox. But two of the young pitchers obtained from the Giants,
Keith Foulke and Bobby Howry, are mainstays of the Sox bullpen and
their surprise rise in the A.L. Central.
</P>
<P>
   -- Other pre-deadline deals: To get John Smiley, the Indians
gave closer Danny Graves to the Reds; to rent Randy Johnson, the
Astros gave Freddy Garcia, John Halama and Carlos Guillen to
Seattle; to rent Todd Stottlemeyer, the Rangers gave Fernando Tatis
to the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   News: The dealing has just begun.
</P>
<P>
   Views: Among the names still on the market are Rangers closer
John Wetteland (best bet: Braves as a three-month rental); Phillie
first baseman Rico Brogna (Red Sox for prospects, maybe the
Cardinals depending on Mark McGwire's health); Seattle pitcher
Brett Tomko (Cleveland for Ricky Ledee); Montreal outfielder
Rondell White (Yankees).
</P>
<P>
   News: Pirates taking phone calls and best offers for Jason
Kendall after the catcher's agent frowns on much-deferred $60
million, 6-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   Views: Allow me to implore Kevin Malone to call the Pirates and
Kendall's agent now and make his best offer for the catcher
(especially since the Padres appear interested, too). He is exactly
what the Dodgers need, a take-charge clubhouse leader who is a good
handler of pitchers and great hitter familiar with leadoff and the
No. 2 slot.
</P>
<P>
   His catching alone would knock half-a-run off the team ERA and
cut opponent's stealing attempts in half. This Dodger team is
willing to roll in the dirt when it needs to, it just needs someone
aggressive to lead the initial charge. Kendall, a Torrance native,
is exactly that kind of guy.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hundley is a good guy who has worked hard to improve on his
disappointing '99 season, but he belongs in the American League,
where he can DH and take an occasional game behind the plate or at
first base.
</P>
<P>
   I don't care about losing his left-handed bat in the lineup.
Neither should Davey Johnson, because if the team doesn't make a
statement in the next two months, he's not going to be around to
worry about it.

 AGRICULTURAL GROUP WINS FINANCING PACKAGE
<TEXT>

   &UR; BY KELLY YAMANOUCHI &LR;

<P>
   &UR; CHRONICLE STAFF WRITER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2000 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Tri Valley Growers, the financially troubled
agricultural cooperative, won bankruptcy court approval Friday for
$270 million in financing from a banking consortium.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Edward Jellen approved the financing
package despite some reservations. ``This is one of those
situations where I wish there was more time to negotiate,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is no time for that. The decision needs to be made
today. I can't hold up the rate at which fruit ripens'' and needs
to be picked.
</P>
<P>
   Growers, who are &UR;  &LR; members of the cooperative that filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy July 10, were relying heavily on the
financing to provide Tri Valley with the money it needs to pay them
for their crops. They had been assured going into the hearing they
would be paid 70 cents on the dollar for their peaches and 60 cents
on the dollar for all other crops.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the growers were unhappy that creditors and lenders had
priority over them in the repayment of debts. ``To me, it doesn't
seem right. We have no voice in the hearings,'' said Mark Wilcox, a
farmer who grows pears and tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   The approved financing will be used to cover $169 million owed
to a consortium of banks. The remainder will be used to cover any
new financial obligations of the cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   William Weintraub, Tri Valley's attorney, stressed during the
hearing how difficult it was for the cooperative to secure
financing. As a result, he said, the cooperative has only been able
to secure bank financing for this year, and not for next year.
</P>
<P>
   The cooperative originally sought more than $300 million in
financing, but during negotiations with creditors and lenders, the
amount was whittled down to $270 million, said Tri Valley spokesman
Fred MacFarlane.

 ONCE-COLORFUL HEARST CORP. NOW DRIVEN MOSTLY BY ECONOMICS

   &UR; 2000 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The crusading zeal that originally defined
Hearst newspapers has receded as far into the past as a hot-metal
Linotype machine.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, for Bay Area readers who want to know what will
happen to The Chronicle under Hearst ownership, the company's past
is not a predictor.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first part of this century, Hearst was very much
characterized by the Chief'' _ legendary founder William Randolph
Hearst, said Orville Schell, dean of the graduate school of
journalism at the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the second half of the century, they've been much more
nondescript. A positive view would be that they're waiting for
greatness,'' Schell said. ``They have an opportunity for that now
in San Francisco..''
</P>
<P>
   As a corporation, Hearst bears little resemblance to the company
that helped ignite the Spanish-American War to sell papers.
</P>
<P>
   It has become a diversified media empire, the 12th largest in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Today, despite its newspaper roots, Hearst's personality is more
strongly defined by its monthly magazines, with such familiar
titles as Cosmopolitan, Esquire, Good Housekeeping and Redbook, and
glitterati editors such as Tina Brown, John Mack Carter, Helen
Gurley Brown, even Oprah. Its broadcasting operations also are
extensive, with partnerships in A&AMP;E and Lifetime cable networks,
and a string of local TV and radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst's newspaper chain has shrunk dramatically since its
heydey in the 1930s, when its 33 papers commanded 15 percent of all
U.S. newspaper readership. The exodus to the suburbs helped kill
many of Hearst's metropolitan papers.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst papers are anchored by one heavy hitter. The Houston
Chronicle, with 553,462 daily readers, is the nation's
ninth-largest paper. During the Chronicle-Hearst antitrust trial,
Hearst Chief Executive Officer Frank A. Bennack Jr. testified that
the Houston Chronicle ``is perhaps closest'' to world-class caliber
of any Hearst paper, but hasn't yet reached that level.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Miller, managing editor of the Houston Chronicle, said
there weren't any dramatic changes when Hearst bought the paper in
1986, but a steady, gradual staff expansion made the paper more
aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in a feisty competition with the Houston Post,'' he
recalled. ``Hearst's message was: Go to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Chronicle ended up winning that war: The Post folded
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to San Francisco, Hearst's large papers are in
Seattle; San Antonio; and Albany, N.Y. But Hearst's dailies, half
of them in Texas, include some as tiny as the 6,142-circulation
Edwardsville (Ill.) Intelligencer. Six of Hearst's papers have
circulations below 22,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bennack, who has been chief executive of Hearst since 1979, is
credited with leading a vigorous expansion that transformed the
company into a modern media conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   In Bennack's first decade at the helm, Hearst spent about $2
billion to acquire more magazines, TV and radio stations and book
publishers, and expanded its activities in cable TV, syndication
and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst newspapers were relatively quick to establish Web sites,
but the company's other pushes into new media have yet to find
success.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Hearst already has a dot-com failure under its belt.
Along with appliance giant Whirlpool, it founded
comparison-shopping site Brandwise.com, which bit the dust in May..
</P>
<P>
   Hearst owns half of Women.com Networks, a Web site for women,
whose stock is down 75 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst's third big online venture, GoodHome.com, co-backed by
Mattel, faces intense competition from other Web furniture stores,
none of which has proved that the market is viable.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst also has a string of investments in Internet firms,
including Exodus Communications, Geneology.com, Quokka Sports and
Talk City.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hearst has added some newspapers under Bennack, notably
the Houston Chronicle, San Antonio Express-News and now The San
Francisco Chronicle, the chain has become adamant about shedding
money-losing papers.
</P>
<P>
   In the l980s, Hearst shut the Baltimore News-American and Los
Angeles Herald-Examiner and sold the Boston Herald American to
Rupert Murdoch. In 1993, it closed the San Antonio Light, after
buying the rival San Antonio Express-News.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Hearst's actions in buying The San Francisco
Chronicle and selling the Examiner were motivated purely by
economics, a parade of Hearst executives testified during the
antitrust trial. Hearst said it would lose ``tens of millions'' of
dollars annually if the Examiner were to publish without a
revenue-sharing agreement with The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   From an editorial perspective, Hearst papers are far less
striking than in William Randolph Hearst's day, when they were a
flamboyant mix of sensational exposes, heart-tugging human interest
stories, screaming headlines and blatant bids to shape public
opinion. Although the term ``yellow journalism'' was coined to
describe Hearst's style, his papers also exposed corruption and
advocated progressive reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The modern Hearst has banished most vestiges of yellow
journalism. But in the process, it has become homogenized so that
its papers are indistinguishable from those of any other chain,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays, it's all very bland,'' said Joe Saltzman, associate
dean at the Annenberg School for Communications at the University
of Southern California. ``There's no corporate personality to what
they do. Corporate decisions are made on a dollar-and-cents
ledger.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the same is true of most other newspaper chains, with
wire stories and syndicated features creating a canned feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hearst newspapers tend to be conservative in tone and
appearance; fairly conventional, hard-news type newspapers,'' said
John Morton, president of media consultant Morton Research in
Silver Spring, Md. (Morton provided expert testimony for Hearst in
the Clint Reilly antitrust suit.) The Examiner, Hearst's first
paper, retained a more distinct personality than the rest of the
lineup, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst's newspaper-business dealings have one clear focus, being
No.1. ``Their goal is to publish the dominant daily in whichever
markets they're in,'' Morton said.
</P>
<P>
   But Hearst's strategies to achieve that goal have been all over
the map. In Seattle, Hearst owns the Post-Intelligencer, a morning
paper that has the unfortunate distinction of lagging behind its
afternoon competitor, the Seattle Times.
</P>
<P>
   The two papers have a joint operating agreement, under which
they share noneditorial functions and split revenues and some
operating expenses.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Hearst agreed to let the Times switch to morning
publication, making Seattle the first city where two papers in a
JOA are competing head to head. But that battle is only for
circulation _ revenues will continue to be shared evenly for at
least the next 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   And Hearst hasn't abandoned the Post-Intelligencer: It pumped
$4.7 million into a newsroom overhaul, including a new computer
system, and expanded its editorial staff by 20 to 210.
</P>
<P>
   In San Antonio, Hearst owned the 112-year-old San Antonio Light,
which lost $60 million between 1987 and 1982. So in 1982 Hearst
bought the larger San Antonio paper, the Express-News. It spent
four months seeking a buyer for the Light and then shut it down.
About 150 of the 600 Light employees got jobs at the Express-News.
Some labor activists were disturbed that the paper that was closed
was unionized, while the one that remained, the Express-News, was
nonunion.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, Hearst swooped into town in 1986 and bought the
Houston Chronicle for $415 million _ at the time, the highest price
ever paid for a newspaper. When publisher Dean Singleton folded the
rival Houston Post in April 1995, Hearst snapped up its assets,
including the subscription list, boosting its circulation by about
32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``No surviving paper has capitalized on the death of its
competitor quite as effectively as has Hearst Corp.'s (Houston)
Chronicle,'' Editor &AMP; Publisher wrote in 1995.

 NORTEL ACQUIRES SAN JOSE'S ALTEON
<TEXT>

   &UR; CHRONICLE STAFF WRITER &LR;

   &UR; 2000 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Nortel Networks Friday agreed to buy San Jose's
Alteon WebSystems for $7.8 billion in stock, stepping up its battle
against Cisco Systems in the fast-growing market for equipment to
handle increasingly large amounts of data across the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The deal comes just two months after Cisco, which is also based
in San Jose, plunked down $4.7 billion for ArrowPoint
Communications, a similar firm, based in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies build sophisticated networking equipment, called
Web switches, to help major Web sites cope with sudden surges of
requests for data and use their networks more efficiently. Nortel
said the market, which Cisco estimated at $500 million this year,
should grow to $4 billion within four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's white hot,'' said Bill Connor, president of Nortel's
corporate division.
</P>
<P>
   Alteon quadrupled sales in the fiscal year ended last month to
$110 million, with $51 million in the fourth quarter alone, and
turned in $7 million in profits.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, ArrowPoint is significantly smaller. Analysts were
expecting ArrowPoint to generate $62 million in revenue this year
before Cisco scooped up the company.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some analysts noted that Alteon also cost Nortel $3
billion more than Cisco paid for ArrowPoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal looks expensive,'' said Duncan Stewart, a portfolio
manager at Tera Capital Corp. in Toronto. ``Nortel portrays itself
as a company that does everything well, and then it says they've
spent nearly $8 billion on something they don't do.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Alteon shareholders also grumbled that Nortel didn't agree
to pay a premium above the current share price. Nortel agreed to
pay $143.77, just above the company's closing price on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies' stock tumbled on the news. Alteon shares fell 10
percent to $129, down $14. Nortel slipped $6.13 to $72.50.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the deal helps explain why government antitrust
regulators haven't investigated Cisco, which builds 80 percent of
the routers that direct traffic on the Internet, with the same zeal
they used with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cisco dominates the market for selling equipment to
business customers, it is increasingly facing competition from
Nortel, Lucent Technologies and other telecommunications equipment
providers.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago, the markets were completely separate. But
as voice calls and computer traffic are increasingly shunted over
similar data networks, the distinctions between the two businesses
have collapsed and both companies have started buying similar
startups and fighting over customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They own the enterprise (or corporate market). We own the
carriers (or phone companies). And we are driving the blurring of
those lines,'' Connor said. Nortel made its big move into data
networking by buying Bay Networks in 1998, while Lucent bought
Ascend Communications a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel's data networking business is especially strong in
Silicon Valley, where the company has 6,000 to 7,000 workers.
Alteon will give it another 500 workers.
</P>
<P>
   But a story this week in Network World raised questions about
how well Nortel has done in the market. The magazine said Nortel
has lost business to Cisco in two key product areas _ high-end
routers and a breed of superfast routers called ``layer 3
switches.'' Both pieces of equipment act like traffic cops,
directing bits of digital information across networks.
</P>
<P>
   Connor, however, insisted the company is doing better in the
fastest-growing segments of the market, such as fiber-optics and
wireless.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel, which is based in Brampton, Ontario, near Toronto, has
gained special attention lately for its optics business. Corning
called off talks about combining their component business, but
Nortel announced this week it will invest $1.9 billion more in the
business.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview earlier this year, Nortel chief executive John
Roth said the company is also considering creating a tracking stock
for the optics-parts business, which has more than $1 billion in
annual revenue, although he said it's too critical to sell off.
Connor said that could still happen. ``We are looking at all
options.''

theatergoers surge into Cedar City, Utah, each summer for the Utah
Shakespeare Festival. The festival began in 1962 with $1,000. Now
it has a $5 million budget and this year won a Tony award for

half-hour episodes, ``American High'' tells the stories of 14
students at Highland Park, a public high school near Chicago. The
material of ``American High'' came from 2,800 hours of digital
footage, about 70 percent of it shot by two crews and the balance
provided by ``video diaries'' kept by the subjects. In Los Angeles,
six ``loggers'' entered the characters' conflicts and dialogue into
a database. An eight-person story department selected footage to

the new CD ``What Would You Give in Exchange for Your Soul?'' packs
a powerful surprise. It contains 15 of the 60 songs Bill Monroe
recorded as the mandolinist, vocalist and junior partner in the
Monroe Brothers, a red-hot duo that scorched the Carolinas in the

   MARKET-WATCH (Undated) _ Rats leaving a sinking ship. That
metaphor sprang to mind to Gretchen Morgenson last Thursday when a
pack of formerly bullish stock analysts suddenly cooled on the
shares of Amazon.com. After the close of trading on Wednesday,
Amazon reported its second-quarter results and 6 of the 35 analysts
that follow Amazon cut their ratings on the stock. Why the
turnabout among Wall Street's finest analytical minds? Amazon's
falling stock. Academic research shows that equity analysts
generally react to changes in stock prices rather than cause them.
Of course, not all equity analysts are down on Amazon's shares.
Mary Meeker at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter remains bullish. Of
course, Morgan Stanley is Amazon's investment bankerand holds a
barrel of the company's convertible bonds, which are trading in the
cellar. By Gretchen Morgenson.

   PROFILE-PECK (Undated) _ Run since its inception by its
founders, Todd Krizelman and Stephan Paternot, both now 26,
Theglobe.com became Wall Street legend for its 1998 initial public
offering when the stock soared 900 percent on the first day. The
fall was sharp, too _ from $40 in April 1999 to around $2 now. The
founders called in the marine _ Charles M. Peck, 55, gray-haired
and gray-flanneled. Peck, whose son is the same age as the company
founders, doesn't foresee a culture clash. ``I haven't played
Ping-Pong with them yet,'' he said. ``But I'm sure I will.'' By

   SCREEN-STRIKE (Los Angeles) _ In the early days of cable, Screen
Actors Guild representatives say, actors and writers cut deals
below network rates to help the fledgling industry. Now, they say,
it's time for payback. As the strike stretches on, movie and
television production are being accelerated as Hollywood prepares
for the possibility of strikes by actors and writers when their
contracts expire next year. The strike over pay for commercials
reflects the new economics of television as cable gains, networks
retreat and new options are created in electronic media, including
the Internet. By Barbara Whitaker.

<P>
   ECON-COLUMN-NAIRU (Undated) _ For many years a raise in interest
rates has hinged on a principle that goes by the acronym Nairu _
Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment. Nairu describes a
level below which the unemployment rate cannot fall without the
inflation rate speeding up. A goal in slowing the economy is to
increase unemployment. Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal
Reserve, has been publicly skeptical for months about Nairu, but
Louis Uchitelle writes that there is something disingenuous about
his burying Nairu while embracing almost the same principle in a
different incarnation. Meanwhile pressure is mounting for the Fed
to wait for inflation to accelerate before it acts again. By Louis
Uchitelle.

four operating units and sell stakes of up to 20 percent in each to

Ecstasy and Special K, but its the dance-driven decadence, the

Mills, who has directed videos and ads for Nike and the Gap. He
wears Brooks Brothers suits. ``People expect a hip and edgy guy to

   JUNGER-BAR (New York) _ Sebastian Junger, the bestselling
author, has opened a bar in Manhattan. Though the Half King has
been billed as a throwback to the old-school writer's haunt, this
one has a movie business buzz to it partly because two of the
co-owners are from the movie business and partly because the film
version of Junger's book, ``The Perfect Storm,'' is a current hit.
There's little doubt that the bar's main attraction _ from the
feminine perspective, at least _ will be Junger, who has become
nearly as famous for his book jacket pose as for his
disaster-at-sea prose and who was even featured in 1997 as People
Magazine's ``Sexiest Writer Alive.'' By Douglas Century.

   GOP-OUTLOOK-REVIEW (Philadelphia) _ There are three things you
will have to look hard for at the Republican National Convention: A
true-blue conservative icon on center stage. Any utterance of the
word ``abortion.'' The standard savaging of the opposition. It is
only fitting that Republicans are somewhat sheepish about taking on

   MIDEAST-SUMMIT-REVIEW (Undated) _ The dirty little secret of the

   AIRCRASHES-TECH-REVIEW (Washington) _ Two air disasters
involving symbols of national pride _ the Concorde in 2000 and the
Hindenburg in 1937 _ are instructive about the difficulties of
predicting technological progress. It remains to be seen whether
the Concorde accident will kill the supersonic transports the way

   DR-LAURA-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Dr. Laura Schlessinger, the

CAPITOL HILL MEMO: NEW SLOGANS, BUT SAME POLICY FIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the political conventions and the campaign
trail beckoning, Democratic and Republican lawmakers left town this
week uttering freshly coined slogans that they hope will help
voters choose sides in the November election.
</P>
<P>
   The ideas behind the slogans, however, are anything but fresh;
instead, they harken to the one age-old difference between
Republicans and Democrats. Does America want to spend money, in
this case part of the budget surplus, on tax cuts? Or does it want
to spend it on programs, like lowering the cost of prescription
drugs?
</P>
<P>
   Spun another way, the charges boil down to this: Democrats want
to sink the taxpayers' money into the giant government money pit,
yet again. Republicans want to line the pockets of the rich, yet
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the classic policy fight,'' said Glen Bolger, a
Republican pollster. ``But instead of red ink they are fighting
over black ink.''
</P>
<P>
   With the House and Senate Democratic leaders by his side,
President Clinton stood in the White House Rose Garden on Thursday
and reminded voters of this fundamental distinction between the
parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last year, the Republican majority has risked
squandering our progress,'' said Clinton, who has threatened to
veto most Republican tax-cutting measures. ``They have passed
reckless tax cut after reckless tax cut after reckless tax cut, to
drain away our hard-earned surplus and put us back in the red.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, he added, ``are leaving town with a trunk full
of unfinished business.''
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority
whip, expressed incredulity at Democrats for their refusal to give
taxpayers a break. After making the obligatory promise to use most
of the surplus to protect Social Security and reduce the national
debt, DeLay accused Clinton of hoarding the gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president doesn't want to return the surplus to the people
who earned it,'' DeLay said at a news conference. ``President
Clinton would rather use the surplus for more Washington
spending.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, both sides have tiptoed toward the middle this year, a
sign of election-year skittishness and a recognition that the other
party's message could catch on.
</P>
<P>
   A number of House Democrats, eager to inoculate themselves on a
popular issue, have voted for a series of Republican tax cuts in
the House, while their leaders, including Clinton, have laid out
their own, more limited proposals to cut taxes.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Republicans, pressured by the rank and file,
have offered their own remedies to address the issues that
Democrats view as their domain, namely lowering the price of
prescription drugs for senior citizens and overhauling managed
health care.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Democrats continue a steady drumbeat about a
``do-nothing'' Congress to the chagrin of Republicans who use every
opportunity to tout their tax-cutting bills, geared mostly to the
elderly, married couples and middle- and upper-class taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans do not seem too concerned that few of their bills
are likely to become law this year because of presidential vetoes.
In an election year, especially, it is the stance, not the result,
that counts. A veto would allow them to pose the question: Imagine
what would happen with a Republican in the White House?
</P>
<P>
   ``I am looking in awe at these accomplishments the Republican
Congress has been able to pass in the past few weeks,'' Dennis
Hastert, the speaker of the House, said while grinning broadly at a
send-off rally the day the Congress departed for its August break.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt, the Democratic leader, also is in awe, he
said, but for different reasons. ``The Republicans today who claim
great achievement have sent President Clinton only 78 bills this
year,'' Gephardt said. ``One out of four of those bills named post
offices and buildings, not exactly the most important matters that
are before us.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are not making it easy for Republicans, who they say
have caved in to special-interest groups in drafting legislation on
prescription drug prices, managed care and gun control. Yet the
Democrats do not appear worried that they will look intransigent,
something Republicans frequently accuse them of being.
</P>
<P>
   ``They block votes,'' said Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, referring
to Democrats in the Senate, which has had a much harder time than
the House in passing bills this year. ``Shame on them. It's a price
that will be very expensive for them in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is not likely to get any easier for Craig and his party;
September and October are typically not the best months for
Republicans, because they must get down to the basic work of
passing spending bills. To do that, they must wrangle with Clinton,
who usually holds the upper hand in these negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The swearing-in this week of Zell Miller, D-Ga., to replace the
late Sen. Paul Coverdell, a Republican, could change the dynamics
of at least one bill when Congress returns: the managed care
legislation backed by Democrats. That bill fell one vote shy of
passage the last time it came up, a few weeks ago. Democrats are
sure to push for it again, aides said.

IRS WORKERS ARE SUSPENDED IN BRIBERY CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)   By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internal Revenue Service has suspended at least eight
workers in the Chicago area in a criminal investigation into
bribery and other offenses, union officials and colleagues of the
workers said.
</P>
<P>
   The suspensions came after agents of the Treasury Department's
inspector general for tax administration made predawn visits to the
homes of at least five IRS employees on June 22, urging them to
cooperate with the investigation, said Charlie Turek, president of
the National Treasury Employees Union local in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Turek and lawyers familiar with the case said a federal grand
jury was expected to hand up indictments, in what would be the
first major corruption case brought against a group of IRS workers
since Congress passed the IRS Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure the inspector general will indict as many as he
can,'' Turek said.
</P>
<P>
   David C. Williams, the inspector general, declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Those under investigation include an appeals officer, two tax
collectors and an auditor.
</P>
<P>
   In one case an IRS worker and a tax professional were taped
discussing a $25,000 fee to fix a tax case, people who have heard
the tape said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the tax collectors was caught on tape agreeing to take
money in return for reclassifying an overdue tax bill as currently
not collectible.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the taping was done by informers who agreed to
wear recording devices after they were presented with evidence of
their role in crimes, tape recorders were also placed at
customer-service counters.
</P>
<P>
   As many as eight IRS workers at four Chicago offices were
suspended with pay three weeks ago and were told that they would be
fired, colleagues said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the workers facing criminal charges, a number of
IRS workers at four Chicago offices are expected to be disciplined
for failing to report efforts to bribe them since the investigation
began in 1998, colleagues and other people who are familiar with
the case said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation also uncovered evidence that at least one IRS
auditor had been paid to prepare tax returns, which were signed by
one of the tax professionals. Federal rules prohibit IRS employees
from preparing tax returns for pay.

   Not even ``Melrose Place'' had as many intrigues as the
telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see. Deutsche Telekom, after failing in its bid to woo
Qwest Communications, made VoiceStream Wireless a $50.7 billion
offer that it could not refuse. This is the same VoiceStream that
had been courted by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone of Japan, the
world's largest telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, JDS Uniphase, the maker of components for
fiber optic networks, struck a deal to acquire SDL, which is in the
same business. Vodafone AirTouch of Britain is acquiring Germany's
Mannesmann, which used to be a publishing company, to get at its
cellular properties. France Telecom agreed to buy Orange PLC, the
British wireless outfit, for $37.5 billion. Corning, once linked
with SDL, was in talks until last week with Nortel Networks about a
possible merger of their optical components businesses. (Yes, that
Corning, the upstate New York company once best known for oven-safe
cookware.)
</P>
<P>
   All clear? Probably not. Even professional investors are having
a tough time making sense of it all. This year, the average
telecommunications mutual fund is down 6.7 percent through
Thursday, compared with the 1.3 percent drop of the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index, according to Morningstar Inc. The sector
took a beating last week after Nokia and WorldCom issued earnings
warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Remember when telecommunications meant telephones, and holding
Ma Bell let you sleep at night? These days, top stocks are far more
volatile. Qualcomm soared 2,619 percent last year only to lose more
than half its value this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a game for widows and orphans,'' said Oscar
Castro, manager of the $497 million Montgomery Global
Communications fund, which is down 10.4 percent for the year
through Thursday after gaining 104 percent in 1999. ``It's not even
a game for day traders.''
</P>
<P>
   Flag Investors Communications, one of the top performers of the
last decade, is down 17.3 percent in 2000, dead last in the
telecommunications fund league, because of big positions in SBC
Communications, Lucent Technologies and Alltel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in an event-driven situation,'' said Liam Burke,
co-manager of the Flag fund. ``Acquisitions are major events. We
don't expect major events from SBC, but we do expect them to
deliver growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke, whose fund remains in the top quarter of
telecommunications funds over the last five years despite the swoon
this year, said he and the fund's co-manager, Bruce E. Behrens,
were strongly disinclined to play mergers. ``There are lots of
people in the takeover speculation game,'' he added. ``We're
long-term holders.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is hard to find stocks that are not involved in the
speculation one way or another, as predator or prey. Underlying the
frenzy is a trend toward forming global powerhouses that offer
wired and wireless ways to transmit voice, data and video.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, there will be a small handful, six or eight
megacompanies with global assets that will be able to go to Fortune
500 companies and offer them soup-to-nuts services,'' said Scott
Lewis, co-manager of the $520 million Warburg Pincus Global
Telecommunications fund.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Deutsche Telekom is making a statement that it will
be one of them, Lewis said. The deal for VoiceStream, if it passes
regulatory muster, will give Deutsche Telekom, No. 2 behind NTT, a
foothold in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   How can an investor best profit from the turmoil and
machinations of the telecommunications industry? That depends on
which manager you ask.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said that he and the fund's other managers ``don't
particularly attempt to forecast takeout candidates.'' Instead,
they prefer to base their moves on relative valuations. One of his
favorite stocks right now is Nextlink Communications, a provider of
telecommunications services to small and medium-sized companies. He
considers it cheap at about six times his projections for this
year's revenue. Not that Nextlink doesn't play ball _ in June, it
completed a deal to acquire Concentric Network, which provides
high-speed Internet access. Nextlink closed at $33 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   For Mario Gabelli, manager of the $450 million Gabelli Global
Telecommunications fund, the best strategy is a simple one: Pick
the acquirees and wait to rake in fat purchase premiums, like the
30 percent premium Deutsche Telekom agreed to pay for VoiceStream.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name of the game is not the buyers,'' he said. ``It's who
they're going to buy, because of the premiums.'' NE of his largest
positions is in Telephone and Data Systems, a Chicago company that
controls 81 percent of U.S. Cellular, in which Gabelli's fund also
owns a stake. He said he believed that U.S. Cellular would be
coveted by companies like AT&AMP;T seeking to expand their wireless
coverage through acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Castro of the Montgomery fund begs to differ with Gabelli's
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very dangerous play to try to pick what the acquirees
will be,'' he said. ``You never know if you'll be acquired. If not,
you're left in the desert.'' And even if the deal does go through,
he added, ``you'll be paid with a currency that may be devalued''
by a volatile market.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Castro is bullish on the slumping Lucent, because
of the planned spinoff of its fiber component and integrated
circuit businesses. ``If you're going to play it, don't play the
acquirees,'' Castro urged. ``Play the ones with a clear strategy of
where they're going.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmm. The experts say bet on the sellers and shun the buyers, or
else go with the buyers, or forget about mergers and acquisitions
and find companies with staying power. Maybe it's a good time to
hide in an index fund until the smoke clears.  &QL;

GARDENING: SHRUBS FOR BEAUTY AND HEALTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 30)  
 By PATRICIA A. TAYLOR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   July is often promoted as national blueberry month, and across
the nation, festivals and pick-your-own farms beckon and tempting
recipes appear in newspapers and magazines.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, says Al Murray of the New Jersey Agriculture
Department, the fruit is being consumed in record amounts. This
increase is due in no small part to findings published last
September by James A. Joseph and Barbara Shukitt-Hale of the U.S.
Agriculture Department's Human Nutrition Center on Aging at Tufts
University. Their research on rats led them to conclude that daily
consumption of one-half to one cup of fresh or frozen blueberries
could slow or even reverse the effects of aging.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, blueberries' popularity was confirmed this month
when the squirrels beat out both the birds and my husband by
stripping my semidwarf plants bare before the berries ripened. That
did not deter my husband, who went out and picked 25 pounds at a
nearby orchard. Thus, I have been making jam, baking and freezing
many blueberry muffins, and serving blueberry pancakes as a treat
on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   I look forward to August and the end of this hoopla. It means I
can return to simply treasuring blueberries as one of the most
handsome, maintenance-free shrubs.
</P>
<P>
   As the great horticulturist Liberty Hyde Bailey wrote a century
ago: ``The plant is beautiful when in flower; the fruit is
attractive and of the best quality, and the bright scarlet and
crimson effects in late autumn, rivaling the sumach in brilliancy,
are unsurpassed. As an ornamental plant, the species deserves a
place in every garden.''
</P>
<P>
   High praise indeed. And it actually neglects the pink blush on
the long-lasting creamy white, one-third-inch, bell-shaped spring
flowers and the red sheen on the bare winter stems. The stems are
particularly lovely when powdered with light snow.
</P>
<P>
   Blueberries are rather temperature-specific. Low-bush
blueberries (Vaccinium angustifolium) thrive in Zones 2 to 6,
high-bush (V. corymbosum) in Zones 5 to 7, and rabbiteye (V. ashei)
in Zones 6 to 9. Though Bailey was referring to the high-bush
berry, all three exhibit the same beautiful ornamental qualities.
All three, said a Canadian government food researcher, Wilhelmina
Kalt, bear berries with anti-aging properties.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Bailey's praise, blueberries have consistently been
grown for their fruit rather than for their appearance. Elizabeth
White, whose family ran a cranberry operation in the New Jersey
Pinelands, can take a lot of credit for that. In 1911, she
contacted Dr. Frederick Coville at the Agriculture Department and
asked about his research on the feasibility of cultivating
blueberries. White believed that such cultivation would be a
profitable second crop, one occurring a month before the cranberry
harvest.
</P>
<P>
   In 1916, five years after the two joined forces, the first
cultivated blueberry was produced and an agricultural industry was
born. Coville provided the scientific expertise to propagate and
hybridize the berries. White contributed the plants, calling on
local ``Pineys'' to search the area for bushes with the most
promising berries.
</P>
<P>
   White paid $2 for every bush that bore berries at least
five-eighths of an inch in diameter and named each bush for its
finder. When Rube Leek of Chatsworth found a promising one, a
quandary arose. Leek wasn't a suitable name, and Rube didn't convey
the plant's usefulness. Coville christened it Rubel; it became a
key commercial blueberry parent and is still sold.
</P>
<P>
   I've had blueberries in my borders for 20 years. I started with
two 5- to 6-foot-tall high-bush cultivars _ Bluecrop and Jersey _
because two varieties are needed for good pollination and both are
suitable for my central New Jersey area. All they required were
well-drained, acidic soil, a weekly watering in dry periods, and a
mostly sunny location to produce summer berries.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, as birds devoured the berries despite a netting over
the bushes, I began to admire the shrubs more for their looks than
for their produce. Five years ago, I did away with the netting and
the big bushes and placed Friendship and Northblue, semi-dwarf
plants known as half highs, in a mixed border. These multiseasonal
plants grow about 4 feet tall and, if netted, can each produce
seven pounds of berries. But I chose them for their handsome look.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs researchers are falling in love with
blueberries' ornamental qualities. About 10 years ago, breeders at
Michigan State University introduced a high-bush-low-bush cross _
Top Hat. Forming a two-foot dense mounded plant, it is perfect for
containers and as a bonsai subject.
</P>
<P>
   And Dr. Nicholi Vorsa, director of the Rutgers University
blueberry and cranberry research laboratory, is evaluating some
beautiful high-bush forms for release. One has corkscrew-type
stems; another, closely packed green leaves iny that they reflect
the powder blue of the berries.
</P>
<P>
   While blueberry bushes might not ultimately prove to be a
fountain of youth, they certainly can constitute an oasis of beauty
and contentment in the garden.
</P>
<P>
   A wide variety of blueberries are sold by Forestfarm, 990
Tetherow Road, Williams, Ore. 97544; (541) 846-7269; catalog $4;
and Hartmann's Nursery, Box 100, Lacota, Mich. 49063; (616)

PRESIDENT OF NBC GETS THE ADDED TITLE OF VICE CHAIRMAN OF GENERAL
ELECTRIC 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The General Electric Co. named Robert C. Wright, the longtime
president of NBC, to the additional post of vice chairman of GE
Friday. He will join the chairman, John F. Welch Jr., and one other
vice chairman, Dennis D. Dammerman, a financial officer, as the
only GE executives on the company's board.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, who has led NBC for 14 years, the longest tenure for any
top executive in network television history, will continue to
manage the network and all of its other media assets, which include
the cable channels CNBC and MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes nine months before the retirement date of Welch,
who is close to Wright professionally and personally. In a
statement Friday, Welch praised Wright as a ``key force in guiding
the company's future growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright, 57, is not a candidate to succeed Welch, a job expected
to go to a GE executive younger than 50. But television industry
executives interpreted Wright's elevation as an effort by Welch to
emphasize the importance of NBC's assets to the future of GE.
</P>
<P>
   Wright said in a telephone interview: ``It's good recognition
for NBC and our media assets, for what NBC has accomplished. It
gives our media assets an important voice at the GE table.''
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized that his new position will not significantly
change his day-to-day role at NBC. ``In the near term, I keep doing
the job,'' Wright said. ``I'm not going anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said the new position will probably mean ``that I'll
pitch in and take on some assignments in GE's larger picture.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC has often been the subject of rumors about a sale to a
Hollywood production studio. It has been suggested that NBC _
without any connection to a bigger entertainment conglomerate as
CBS now has with Viacom, Fox has with the News Corp. and ABC has
with the Walt Disney Co. _ will be at a disadvantage in a media
world dominated by huge entities like AOL Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of a new chairman is likely to start new speculation
about GE shedding NBC. Wright said that the GE emphasis on
maintaining growth in earnings has made it ``a real challenge''
when ``trying to do deals to keep ourselves growing.'' Unlike other
media companies, NBC had not been able to add assets if the
acquisition price could dilute the company's earnings.
</P>
<P>
   But Wright said he expected NBC to remain a highly valued asset
for GE ``The national use of video content is going to be hugely
important to the marketplace going forward,'' Wright said.

ONCE-COLORFUL HEARST CORP. NOW DRIVEN MOSTLY BY ECONOMICS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; BY CAROLYN SAID &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHRONICLE STAFF WRITER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2000 San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The crusading zeal that originally defined
Hearst newspapers has receded as far into the past as a hot-metal
Linotype machine.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, for Bay Area readers who want to know what will
happen to The Chronicle under Hearst ownership, the company's past
is not a predictor.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first part of this century, Hearst was very much
characterized by the Chief'' _ legendary founder William Randolph
Hearst, said Orville Schell, dean of the graduate school of
journalism at the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the second half of the century, they've been much more
nondescript. A positive view would be that they're waiting for
greatness,'' Schell said. ``They have an opportunity for that now
in San Francisco..''
</P>
<P>
   As a corporation, Hearst bears little resemblance to the company
that helped ignite the Spanish-American War to sell papers.
</P>
<P>
   It has become a diversified media empire, the 12th largest in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Today, despite its newspaper roots, Hearst's personality is more
strongly defined by its monthly magazines, with such familiar
titles as Cosmopolitan, Esquire, Good Housekeeping and Redbook, and
glitterati editors such as Tina Brown, John Mack Carter, Helen
Gurley Brown, even Oprah. Its broadcasting operations also are
extensive, with partnerships in A&AMP;E and Lifetime cable net &LR;   &LR; works,
and a string of local TV and radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst's newspaper chain has shrunk dramatically since its
heydey in the 1930s, when its 33 papers commanded 15 percent of all
U.S. newspaper readership. The exodus to the suburbs helped kill
many of Hearst's metropolitan papers.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst papers are anchored by one heavy hitter. The Houston
Chronicle, with 553,462 daily readers, is the nation's
ninth-largest paper. During the Chronicle-Hearst antitrust trial,
Hearst Chief Executive Officer Frank A. Bennack Jr. testified that
the Houston Chronicle ``is perhaps closest'' to world-class caliber
of any Hearst paper, but hasn't yet reached that level.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Miller, managing editor of the Houston Chronicle, said
there weren't any dramatic changes when Hearst bought the paper in
1986, but a steady, gradual staff expansion made the paper more
aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in a feisty competition with the Houston Post,'' he
recalled. ``Hearst's message was: Go to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Chronicle ended up winning that war: The Post folded
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to San Francisco, Hearst's large papers are in
Seattle; San Antonio; and Albany, N.Y. But Hearst's dailies, half
of them in Texas, include some as tiny as the 6,142-circulation
Edwardsville (Ill.) Intelligencer. Six of Hearst's papers have
circulations below 22,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bennack, who has been chief executive of Hearst since 1979, is
credited with leading a vigorous expansion that transformed the
company into a modern media conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   In Bennack's first decade at the helm, Hearst spent about $2
billion to acquire more magazines, TV and radio stations and book
publishers, and expanded its activities in cable TV, syndication
and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst newspapers were relatively quick to establish Web sites,
but the company's other pushes into new media have yet to find
success.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Hearst already has a dot-com failure under its belt.
Along with appliance giant Whirlpool, it founded
comparison-shopping site Brandwise.com, which bit the dust in May..
</P>
<P>
   Hearst owns half of Women.com Networks, a Web site for women,
whose stock is down 75 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst's third big online venture, GoodHome.com, co-backed by
Mattel, faces intense competition from other Web furniture stores,
none of which has proved that the market is viable.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst also has a string of investments in Internet firms,
including Exodus Communications, Geneology.com, Quokka Sports and
Talk City.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hearst has added some newspapers under Bennack, notably
the Houston Chronicle, San Antonio Express-News and now The San
Francisco Chronicle, the chain has become adamant about shedding
money-losing papers.
</P>
<P>
   In the l980s, Hearst shut the Baltimore News-American and Los
Angeles Herald-Examiner and sold the Boston Herald American to
Rupert Murdoch. In 1993, it closed the San Antonio Light, after
buying the rival San Antonio Express-News.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Hearst's actions in buying The San Francisco
Chronicle and selling the Examiner were motivated purely by
economics, a parade of Hearst executives testified during the
antitrust trial. Hearst said it would lose ``tens of millions'' of
dollars annually if the Examiner were to publish without a
revenue-sharing agreement with The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   From an editorial perspective, Hearst papers are far less
striking than in William Randolph Hearst's day, when they were a
flamboyant mix of sensational exposes, heart-tugging human interest
stories, screaming headlines and blatant bids to shape public
opinion. Although the term ``yellow journalism'' was coined to
describe Hearst's style, his papers also exposed corruption and
advocated progressive reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The modern Hearst has banished most vestiges of yellow
journalism. But in the process, it has become homogenized so that
its papers are indistinguishable from those of any other chain,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays, it's all very bland,'' said Joe Saltzman, associate
dean at the Annenberg School for Communications at the University
of Southern California. ``There's no corporate personality to what
they do. Corporate decisions are made on a dollar-and- cents
ledger.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the same is true of most other newspaper chains, with
wire stories and syndicated features creating a canned feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hearst newspapers tend to be conservative in tone and
appearance; fairly conventional, hard-news type newspapers,'' said
John Morton, president of media consultant Morton Research in
Silver Spring, Md. (Morton provided expert testimony for Hearst in
the Clint Reilly antitrust suit.) The Examiner, Hearst's first
paper, retained a more distinct personality than the rest of the
lineup, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst's newspaper-business dealings have one clear focus, being
No.1. ``Their goal is to publish the dominant daily in whichever
markets they're in,'' Morton said.
</P>
<P>
   But Hearst's strategies to achieve that goal have been all over
the map. In Seattle, Hearst owns the Post-Intelligencer, a morning
paper that has the unfortunate distinction of lagging behind its
afternoon competitor, the Seattle Times.
</P>
<P>
   The two papers have a joint operating agreement, under which
they share noneditorial functions and split revenues and some
operating expenses.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Hearst agreed to let the Times switch to morning
publication, making Seattle the first city where two papers in a
JOA are competing head to head. But that battle is only for
circulation _ revenues will continue to be shared evenly for at
least the next 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   And Hearst hasn't abandoned the Post-Intelligencer: It pumped
$4.7 million into a newsroom overhaul, including a new computer
system, and expanded its editorial staff by 20 to 210.
</P>
<P>
   In San Antonio, Hearst owned the 112-year-old San Antonio Light,
which lost $60 million between 1987 and 1982. So in 1982 Hearst
bought the larger San Antonio paper, the Express-News. It spent
four months seeking a buyer for the Light and then shut it down.
About 150 of the 600 Light employees got jobs at the Express-News.
Some labor activists were disturbed that the paper that was closed
was unionized, while the one that remained, the Express-News, was
nonunion.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, Hearst swooped into town in 1986 and bought the
Houston Chronicle for $415 million _ at the time, the highest price
ever paid for a newspaper. When publisher Dean Singleton folded the
rival Houston Post in April 1995, Hearst snapped up its assets,
including the subscription list, boosting its circulation by about
32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``No surviving paper has capitalized on the death of its
competitor quite as effectively as has Hearst Corp.'s (Houston)
Chronicle,'' Editor &AMP; Publisher wrote in 1995.

A SPIKE IN ELECTRICITY PRICES SETS OFF DEBATE IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
  By   ALEX BERENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With electricity prices soaring in San Diego, and
consumer anger rising even faster, California politicians are
backing away from the state's ambitious plan to deregulate its
power industry fully by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The fight in California, which four years ago led to the current
national movement to deregulate the electric industry, is likely to
ignite a debate across the country over whether deregulation is
working, politicians here say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nationwide problem,'' said State Sen. Steve Peace, a
San Diego Democrat who helped write the deregulation legislation
but is now calling for some government controls on prices.
</P>
<P>
   High demand and tight supplies have given too much market power
to a few generators and power marketers, causing prices to spike
unreasonably, Peace said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market can either prove that it's disciplined enough and
stable enough to address its problem,'' he said, ``or, inevitably,
whether it's the right thing to do or the wrong thing to do, the
political system will cut them off at the pass.''
</P>
<P>
   That view gained momentum on Thursday, when Gov. Gray Davis
asked the federal government to impose controls on the wholesale
price of electricity across the West. Residential consumers and
businesses need relief from price spikes that more than doubled the
average monthly electric bill in San Diego in June, the governor
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When California deregulated the electricity market in 1996,''
Davis said, ``consumers were promised that competition in the
marketplace would be mature enough to ensure stable, if not
reduced, prices. That is clearly not the case in California.''
</P>
<P>
   Big swings in the wholesale price of electricity are not unusual
in the summer, when high demand taxes generators' ability to supply
power. In New England, the wholesale cost of power reached more
than 100 times its usual level for a few hours during an unexpected
heat wave this May. But because of regulation, consumers and
businesses have always been insulated from the swings, paying one
price for electricity year-round, regardless of its true cost.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as California makes the complex transition from a regulated
to a competitive market, San Diego has become the first market in
the nation where consumers must pay retail prices that move with
the true wholesale price as it changes from month to month. And
they are not happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Diego in many ways is the poster child for how not to do
deregulation,'' said Michael Shames, executive director of the
Utility Consumers Action Network, a 42,000-member group based in
San Diego, where the average monthly residential bill rose in June
to more than $100, from about $50.
</P>
<P>
   But power companies and many economists argue that price
controls are a misguided and shortsighted measure that will only
increase the risk of blackouts in both the short run and the long.
Price caps failed on both natural gas and gasoline, and they will
fail on electricity, said William Hogan, a professor of public
policy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard who
has studied deregulation and worked as a consultant for utilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to have lots of shortages of natural gas; now we have
lots of natural gas,'' Hogan said. ``The reason we had shortages is
we had price controls. That's what electricity is facing now.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, independent power generators are moving quickly to
add new plants to bring supply and demand back into line, said
Jeffrey K. Skilling, president of the Enron Corp., a Houston
company that is the world's leading trader of electricity and
natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let the market do its thing,'' Skilling said. ``The system is
tight around the country, but there's been an enormous supply
response.''

FOR NEGOTIATOR, CAREER ENDS AS IT BEGAN, IN CRISIS

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was Detective Sgt. Daniel Karas' last day on the
job. Karas, a hostage negotiator for the Port Authority police, was
eating a piece of his retirement cake and preparing to turn in his
badge and gun on Thursday night when the police radio crackled: a
gunman had taken over an airplane about to leave for Las Vegas and
was holding hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Karas, 45, put the cake down, postponed the farewells and headed
out from the Port Authority police station at Kennedy International
Airport to Terminal 4. ``When that call comes, you go,'' he said
later. ``I still had my badge and gun.''
</P>
<P>
   When he got to the airplane carrying National Airlines Flight
19, two colleagues, Detective Curtis King and Detective Lt. Robert
Caron, had already begun talking with the gunman, who was holding
the pilot and co-pilot hostage in the cockpit. Sergeant Karas
joined in.
</P>
<P>
   Making contact was not easy. At first, the officers drove under
the Boeing 757 and plugged a set of headphones and a mouthpiece
into a jack that is usually used by ground crews to communicate
with the pilots before takeoff. After talking to the gunman through
the plane jack, the officers began to radio the cockpit through the
airport's control tower.
</P>
<P>
   It was stressful work, with two lives held at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``You run on adrenaline,'' said King, the lead negotiator. ``You
keep your fingers crossed.''
</P>
<P>
   Caron said the officers had one goal: to keep the gunman
talking. ``The more you talk to him, the friendlier you get, the
better your chances,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was, by all accounts, a rambling conversation. While none of
the hostage negotiators would describe what was said, other police
officials said the gunman, who was identified by law enforcement
authorities as Aaron Commey, 22, asked to go to Antarctica, spoke
about suicide and talked about wanting to go to South America.
</P>
<P>
   Just to keep him talking, they said, one of the officers asked
Commey if he liked the Knicks. Using a vulgar expression, he
responded that he did not.
</P>
<P>
   There was relief when Commey released the pilot around 12:10
a.m. Friday and the co-pilot at 12:50 a.m. Then he remained alone
in the cockpit _ with heavily armed police officers waiting in the
plane's cabin _ for two and a half hours more before he
surrendered. The 143 passengers aboard the plane had already
escaped unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   Karas went back to the Port Authority police station. In a
sense, his 23-year career had come full circle: on July 4, 1977,
just a few days after he joined the force, a Vermont-bound bus was
hijacked from the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan and
diverted to Kennedy in a bloody spree that paralyzed the airport
and left two dead.
</P>
<P>
   He said Friday that he was relieved that no one on the Boeing
757 was injured. He finally left work at 8 a.m. to turn in that
badge and gun.
</P>
<P>
   Inspector Anthony Infante, the commanding officer at Kennedy
Airport, had this to say of the sergeant's last day: ``It was a
hell of a goodbye.''

   CLINTON CRITICIZES BUSH
</P>
<P>
   As hundreds of Democrats feasted on lobster and clams Friday at
a fund-raiser for Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy in Barrington, R.I.,
President Clinton served up some partisan zingers. Clinton mocked
Gov. George W. Bush for his gee-whiz attitude toward the
presidency. ``I've been governor of Texas. My daddy was president.
I own a baseball team. They like me down there,'' Clinton said,
imitating Bush. ``Everything is rocking along hunky-dory. Their
fraternity had it for eight years. Give it to ours for eight
years.'' The president said the Republicans were trying to blur the
serious policy differences, especially over how to handle the
budget surplus, between Bush and Vice President Al Gore. ``That's
the message, isn't it? Blur, blur, blur,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The president helped Kennedy raise $450,000 for his
congressional campaign and then flew to Boston, where two events
last night collected $950,000 for the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   PROTEST SITE SET IN LOS ANGELES
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for civil liberties groups and the city of Los Angeles
agreed Friday on a protest site for demonstrators at the Democratic
National Convention, a parking lot across from the entrance to the
Staples Center, where the convention will be held in mid-August,
officials said. A federal judge had ruled last week that the
proposed site, in a parking lot farther away and out of sight and
earshot of entering delegates, was unconstitutionally restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   POLLS GIVE BUSH A WIDER LEAD
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore had appeared to be steadily chipping away
at Gov. George W. Bush's lead in the polls, and in several had
almost pulled even. But since Tuesday, when Bush picked Dick Cheney
to be his running mate, the Texas governor has reopened the gap to
double digits, two polls indicated. A Time magazine poll released
Friday found that Bush led Gore by 16 percentage points, 52 percent
to 36 percent. Ralph Nader of the Green Party had 5 percent, and
Pat Buchanan of the Reform Party 4 percent. A CNN-USA Today Gallup
Poll on Thursday had Bush ahead of Gore by 11 points, 50 percent to
39 percent. Nader had 4 percent and Buchanan 1 percent. Both polls
had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage
points.

KANSAS CITY AREA GAS PRICES DOWN AGAIN THIS WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GENE MEYER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo _ Area gasoline prices
slipped another notch this week, to a metropolitan average of $1.39
a gallon for regular, AAA Automobile Club said in its latest Daily
Fuel Gauge report.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Fuel Gauge estimate is taken from a daily sampling of prices
reported on charge card purchases. Auto club pollsters also conduct
a more formal survey each week by making firsthand price checks at
pumps.
</P>
<P>
   The latest change puts Kansas City area prices about midway
between the $1.63 prevailing a month ago at many pumps and the
$1.14 motorists paid this time last year.
</P>
<P>
   The chief reasons for the latest drop continue to be lower crude
oil and wholesale gasoline prices and another small increase in
fuel supplies, said Mike Right, AAA's chief spokesman in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Among other cities in the region that AAA checked, prices were
lowest in Wichita, Kan., at $1.33 a gallon compared with $1.70 a
month ago. Prices dropped the most in Topeka, Kan., to $1.38 a
gallon from $1.79 a month ago. St. Louis motorists are paying an
average of $1.40 a gallon, down 20 cents from a month ago, while
prices in Joplin, Mo., are down 22 cents to an average of $1.39.

AUDIT FAULTS FIRM THAT RUNS WELFARE-TO-WORK PROGRAMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)   By CHRISTOPHER DREW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   State auditors in Wisconsin said Friday that Maximus Inc., the
United States' largest operator of welfare-to-work programs, had
billed Wisconsin for $466,000 since 1997 in improper or
questionable expenses, including more than 300 hours that its
employees spent seeking contracts in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Maximus, based in McLean, Va., has come under sharp criticism
for its business practices in recent months, and a state judge in
New York has held up Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's administration's
plans to award it more than $100 million in contracts to help
welfare recipients find work.
</P>
<P>
   While Maximus officials said that many of the charges in
Wisconsin were justified, they added that the company had repaid
about $190,000 for expenditures that the state's auditors
considered improper. Some of this money was used for holiday
parties and concerts, including an appearance by the singer Melba
Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Janice Mueller, the Wisconsin state auditor, said the state and
the company would negotiate over other possible repayments.
According to a report released Friday, Mueller and her auditors
found $276,000 in additional charges that might have been excessive
or were poorly documented.
</P>
<P>
   The company's problems in Wisconsin have broader significance
because it still hopes to win the New York contracts. The Giuliani
administration has appealed the judge's ruling in April that the
bid process was corrupted because Maximus had early access to
officials developing the program.
</P>
<P>
   The administration asked the judge to rule on the issue because
the city comptroller, Alan Hevesi, refused to approve the
contracts. Referring to the Wisconsin audit, Hevesi said Friday:
``The evidence continues to pile up that Maximus is not a
responsible contractor. This is just one more example.''
</P>
<P>
   Rachael Rowland, a spokeswoman for Maximus, said the company
believed that most of the Wisconsin charges were legitimate. She
said the company had mistakenly billed Wisconsin for $51,000 in
wages for time that its employees spent seeking contracts in New
York and five other states, but said it was included in the
$190,000 that had been repaid. But she said Maximus repaid the rest
as ``a good-faith effort.''
</P>
<P>
   She said some of these expenditures were ``examples of our
innovative, out-of-the-box approach'' to helping welfare recipients
shift into the work force. The auditors, for instance, disallowed a
$23,000 payment to Moore, who gave a motivational speech and
performed in concert for former welfare recipients. Rowland said
the singer had once been on welfare herself and helped encourage
some of the job seekers.
</P>
<P>
   But the auditors also rejected more than $15,000 in expenditures
for holiday parties and social events for Maximus employees and
questioned $22,000 in restaurant charges and $1,500 for flowers.
The auditors noted that Maximus spent $196,000 on types of
advertising, including mugs and backpacks with the company's name,
that ``appear to have been more promotional than informational.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland said some of the meals were served to former welfare
recipients, and she said the advertising was needed to increase the
company's visibility in Wisconsin.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Anthony W. Koncel, a pilot with 30 years of
experience, was settling in at the instrument panel of National
Airlines Flight 19 on Thursday night and preparing for another run
from New York to Las Vegas when the door of the cockpit burst open.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy came into the cockpit, put a gun to my head, and
said, `Go south _ I'm taking over the airplane,''' said Koncel,
recalling his 2 1/2 hour ordeal as a hostage. ``We said, `South
where?' He came back with, `Miami.'''
</P>
<P>
   As heavily armed police officers from a special unit boarded the
Boeing 757 at Kennedy International Airport and helped the last of
the 143 passengers to escape _ many by sliding down an inflatable
chute in the rear of the plane _ Koncel and his co-pilot, Sean
Walkerley, were held captive by a nervous young man who kept
changing his mind about where he wanted the plane to go: first
Miami, then Buenos Aires, finally Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   With a metallic gray Smith &AMP; Wesson 10-mm pistol trained at his
head, Koncel, 48, showed the gunman how to use the cockpit's radio
so he could talk to the police negotiators who were trying to coax
him to surrender. The pilot listened in silence as the gunman
claimed that the U.S. government was cloning humans and that he had
been deported from Argentina for weapons smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   After what seemed like ages, Koncel said, the negotiations
proved successful. The gunman agreed to free Koncel, then
Walkerley. Finally, at 3:38, the gunman surrendered. Police
identified him as Aaron Amartei Commey, a 22-year-old Bronx native
who had lived most recently in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Commey was arraigned Friday afternoon in U.S. District Court in
Brooklyn on charges of attempted air piracy, and Magistrate Judge
A. Simon Chrein ordered him held until he undergoes a psychiatric
evaluation. The judge said Commey had no criminal history.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Commey had admitted to planning to take over an
airplane for months. They said he told investigators that he would
have used the handgun and hunting knife he was carrying against
anyone who disobeyed his orders.
</P>
<P>
   Commey's defense lawyer, Michael K. Schneider, said that he
decided to ask the judge to order the psychiatric evaluation after
speaking with his client for an hour. ``It seems like a sad case,''
said Schneider, a public defender. ``A 22-year-old man apparently
hijacking a plane to go to Antarctica.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe that Commey left Milwaukee by bus on
Tuesday, arriving in New York on Wednesday morning. He told
investigators that he left a bag with a shotgun and 25 shells in
the Port Authority Bus Terminal.
</P>
<P>
   At around 10:26 Thursday night, officials said, Commey arrived
at Terminal 4, an international terminal at Kennedy Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most airport terminals, whose security checkpoints are a
good distance away from the departure gates, the security
checkpoints at Terminal 4 are at each gate, less than 50 feet from
the entrance to the airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Commey simply walked up to the metal detector and X-ray machine
at Gate 33 and kept on walking, police said. When one of the
unarmed security guards stationed at the checkpoint challenged him,
the police said, he pulled out his gun and kept on walking.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers said that Commey placed his finger to his lips,
signaling them to be quiet.
</P>
<P>
   At the gate, the stunned security guards had pressed a button,
calling for help. By chance, Andrew Anderson and Richard Miller,
two emergency service officers with the Port Authority Police
Department, were driving one of the department's armored cars about
100 yards away from the plane when they got the call.
</P>
<P>
   They drove to the gate, where a ramp worker told them that the
gunman was on the plane. They ran up the Jetway, where a few
passengers were already beginning to flee, and entered the cabin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a fireman running to a burning building _
everybody's running out, you're running in,'' Miller said. ``Same
principle. Your training kicks in.''
</P>
<P>
   There were still about a hundred people on the plane. Anderson
said he and his partner positioned themselves in the center aisle,
facing the cockpit, and told the flight attendant to open the
inflatable chute and have the passengers evacuate the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Once alone on the plane, the officers took cover behind two
drink carts and waited for backup officers and help from the New
York Police Department and the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Hostage negotiators took positions below the airplane and tried
to talk the gunman out of the cockpit. Everyone waited.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the cockpit, Koncel listened to Commey talk with the
negotiators. ``He was really paranoid,'' Koncel said. ``A lot of
what he said didn't make sense at all. He said that he had had a
run-in in Argentina, and was deported to the U.S. for smuggling
weapons into Buenos Aires.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, he insisted on talking with the consul general of
Argentina. The police sent a squad car to the bewildered diplomat's
residence and raced him out to the airport to be on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Commey also spent part of his time in the cockpit speaking about
cloning. ``He said that they had been cloning people in the United
States for a long time,'' Koncel said. ``He was just rambling.''
</P>
<P>
   After Koncel and Walkerley were released, the police negotiators
kept talking. The gunman spoke of suicide, a police official said,
and some investigators feared he would do something to force one of
the police officers on the scene to shoot him. But the negotiators
kept talking, and he calmed down.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, just after 3:30 a.m., the gunman had a new demand: he
wanted to wash his face. ``He wanted to wipe his face, to freshen
up,'' a police official said. ``We told him it would be OK, and he
agreed to come out.''

FLEISHER SHOOTS RECORD 63 TO LEAD LONG ISLAND CLASSIC 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CAVANAUGH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The saying in sports that it is not how you start but how you
finish was borne out again Friday when Dana Quigley birdied the
first three holes but still trailed Bruce Fleisher by a stroke
after the opening round of the Lightpath Long Island Classic Senior
PGA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   En route to his 8-under 64 at the Meadow Brook Club in Jericho,
N.Y., Quigley had eight birdies and a bogey. Fleisher, the
defending champion, also had eight birdies during a bogey-free
round, and three came on the final three holes as he fired a
course-record 63.
</P>
<P>
   Two strokes off the lead was David Lundstrom, who, like Quigley,
is 53 years old and in his third year on the Senior PGA Tour.
Lundstrom shot a 66 with no bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher, 51, won only once in more than 400 tournaments on the
PGA Tour from 1969 to 1998. As a rookie on the Senior Tour last
year, Fleisher became a dominant player, winning seven tournaments,
player of the year and rookie of the year honors, the Byron Nelson
trophy for low-scoring average (69.19), and earning more
($2,515,705) than any other player.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Fleisher has not let up. He has won three events, and
only Hale Irwin has won as many. Fleisher has also finished second
five times, including a tie for second at the Instinet Classic in
Princeton, N.J., last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   After Quigley, the iron man of the Senior PGA Tour with
appearances in 101 consecutive tournaments, birdied the first three
holes, he landed his 5-iron tee shot about 18 feet from the flag on
the par-3 fourth hole. But he three-putted for his only bogey. That
turned out to be the difference in the first-round lead.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Littler, at 70 the oldest player in the field of 78, had a
1-under 71, as did Tom Longo, the head professional at the Seawane
Club in Hewlett Harbor, N.Y., who is a qualifier.

BODY OF VICTIM ISN'T ESSENTIAL FOR PROSECUTION OF A MURDER CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY RIZZO  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ John Edward Robinson
Sr. was in prison for fraud the last time Johnson County, Kan.,
District Attorney Paul Morrison tried a murder case without the
alleged victims' bodies.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now, 10 years later, Robinson is back behind bars and Morrison
is preparing to prosecute him for the death of a woman, even though
her body has not been found.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was charged Friday with first-degree murder in the
alleged 1985 death of Lisa Stasi. He already was facing murder
charges in the deaths of five other women whose bodies were found
in barrels in June.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a body is not required to prove a murder in Kansas.
The state's landmark case addressing the issue was the 1971 Kiowa
County conviction of George Pyle.
</P>
<P>
   Pyle set his grandmother's house on fire after she had cut him
out of her will. The body would not have been consumed in the fire,
experts testified at the time, but no body was found.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas Supreme Court upheld the conviction and established
that a murder could be proved through circumstantial evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison relied on the precedent of that case when he charged
Richard Grissom Jr. in 1989 with the murders of three missing
women. It was the first, and until now, the only murder prosecution
in Johnson County without a body.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Rusch, Joan Butler and Theresa Brown have never been
found, but a jury found Grissom guilty in 1990 and he was sentenced
to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Keys, credit cards, jewelry and other items that belonged to the
women helped link Grissom to their disappearances.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony of their families also was crucial, establishing
that all had close relationships with relatives and friends and
would not have voluntarily abandoned them.
</P>
<P>
   In legal papers filed at the time, Morrison cited a California
Court of Appeals decision in the case of infamous killer Charles
Manson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that a murderer may successfully dispose of the body
of the victim does not entitle him to an acquittal,'' the court
said. ``That is one form of success for which society has no
reward.''

WHEN STATE MOTTOS REFER TO GOD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)   By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Ohio, with God all things are still possible. At least for a
few months anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Two week ago, a majority of the judges on the U.S. Court of
Appeals voted to vacate a ruling made in April by a three-member
panel of the court. That 2-1 ruling declared that Ohio's state
motto, ``With God All Things Are Possible,'' was ``an endorsement
of the Christian religion'' and therefore unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The full Court of Appeals has decided to rehear the case,
brought by the Ohio American Civil Liberties Union. Perhaps it
hopes to do a better job of answering the question that has had
Ohioans scratching their heads since April. They see the national
motto, ``In God We Trust,'' stamped on every bill and coin they
handle, adorning courtroom walls and prominently displayed in the
House of Representatives and the Senate. So why is ``In God We
Trust'' constitutional, as federal courts have repeatedly ruled,
but not Ohio's ``With God All Things Are Possible''?
</P>
<P>
   The same question may interest residents of other states, like
South Dakota (``Under God, the People Rule'') or Colorado
(``Nothing Without the Deity'') or even Arizona (``Ditat Deus,''
which is Latin for ``God Enriches'').
</P>
<P>
   The crux of the matter is that ``With God All Things Are
Possible'' are words spoken by Jesus in Matthew's Gospel (chapter
19, verse 26). ``In God We Trust,'' on the other hand, is of less
certain provenance, most likely coming from the first line of the
King James translation of Psalm 16 (``In Thee do I put my trust'')
and filtered through the last verse of ``The Star-Spangled Banner''
(``Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just, And this be our
motto: In God is our trust'').
</P>
<P>
   In April, this was enough for Judge Avern Cohn to conclude that
Jesus' words represented a particular notion of salvation, ``a
uniquely Christian thought not shared by Jews and Muslims.'' He may
have been a bit hasty on that point since the Council on
American-Islamic Relations promptly protested that similar language
``is used many times throughout the Koran.'' The president of the
Islamic Society of Greater Columbus also noted that the ACLU, in
its solicitude for the rights of Muslims, had filed its suit
without consulting any.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish reaction to the ruling, following a precedent of several
thousand years, was divided, although a Christian theologian
pointed to passages in the Psalms and other books of the Hebrew
Bible expressing the same sentiment as Jesus' words.
</P>
<P>
   In a concurring opinion, Judge Gilbert S. Merritt was even more
theologically subtle than Cohn in finding differences between ``In
God We Trust'' and ``With God All Things Are Possible.'' The two
mottos speak of different ``Gods,'' he discovered. The God of
Ohio's motto is ``a personal, all-knowing God'' who makes all
things possible through the ``miracle of supernatural
intervention'' in daily affairs, Merritt wrote.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, ``the God in whom we `trust''' in the
national motto, he went on, ``could be the God of Jefferson's deism
or even perhaps the laws of science or the cosmology of Newton or
Einstein.''
</P>
<P>
   With all this attention to the word ``God,'' it is surprising
that the judges worried so little about the word ``we.'' After all,
the national motto much more directly implicates the atheist
citizen than does Ohio's. A logic-chopping atheist could even agree
that ``with God all things are possible'' _ if there were a God,
that is, which by an atheist's lights, there is not.
</P>
<P>
   Not many Ohioans were aware of their motto's suspect origins or
its profound theological overtones. According to an ACLU poll, only
2 percent of Ohioans were aware of the motto at all.
</P>
<P>
   The motto has been around since 1959, three years after Congress
got around to voting official standing to ``In God We Trust,''
which began appearing on U.S. currency in 1860. The ruckus in Ohio
started with a plan to engrave ``With God All Things Are Possible''
in 6-inch to 8-inch letters on a granite plaza near the statehouse,
in the same square where the ACLU was last active defending the Ku
Klux Klan's right to raise a cross.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the Ohio motto may have been most noticeable _ and
perhaps most consoling _ on all the forms sent out from the state's
Department of Taxation.
</P>
<P>
   One can only hope that in rehearing the case the appeals court
does not overlook any opportunities for public enlightenment. It
would be interesting, for example, to hear a witness like the Rev.
David T. Ball, the chaplain and director of religious life at
Denison University in Granville, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Analyzing the case in the June 21-28 issue of The Christian
Century, Ball noted that the state of Ohio had given the motto a
meaning almost opposite Jesus'. ``It is a compelling symbol of
hope, inspiration and stick-to-it-iveness,'' the state had argued
in defense of the motto.
</P>
<P>
   In Matthew's Gospel, however, Jesus' words came right after he
had pronounced that ``it is easier for a camel to go through the
eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.''
His disciples were surprised and asked ``Then who can be saved?''
For humans it is impossible, Jesus replied, but ``with God all
things are possible.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, this was originally not a booster's affirmation
of God-backed enterprise and human potential. It was Jesus'
declaration of divine power contrasted to human frailty.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely to avoid that misinterpretation, Ball writes, the New
Revised Standard Version of the Bible does not use ``with God'' but
translates the passage ``For God all things are possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The reminder that this phrase is a translation of a Greek text
about a man who spoke Aramaic suggests other witnesses the court
could call. One, of course, could be a member of the band of
skeptical Biblical scholars known as the Jesus Seminar, who could
testify that in the Seminar's own edition of the Gospels these
words appear in black, meaning that Jesus did not say or believe
them but that they came from later Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Most important would be a post-modern theoretician of texts and
their interpretation. Does a phrase like this get its meaning from
its original context or from how it has come to be used? If
Americans discovered tomorrow that ``In God We Trust'' was
originally a Hindu mantra, does it mean that the currency endorses
Hinduism?
</P>
<P>
   Such testimony might provide amusement as well as enlightenment,
and it hard to see what else this whole exercise is accomplishing.

WOMAN TRAPPED IN BANK VAULT SUFFOCATES 
</HEADLINE>
  By   ELISSA GOOTMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A woman working at a financial services company in
Manhattan died Thursday night after accidentally locking herself in
a vault and triggering a fire extinguishing system that filled the
chamber with carbon dioxide, the police said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Esther Penn, 35, became trapped at about 9 p.m. in
the 10,000-square-foot vault while storing stock receipts.
</P>
<P>
   Before pulling the fire alarm, Penn used an in-house telephone
in the vault to call her supervisor, and left a message on his
voice mail saying she was trapped, the police said. She then
apparently panicked, pulling a lever marked ``fire suppression,''
which activated the extinguisher system instead of merely summoning
help. She was found by firefighters and pronounced dead on arrival
at New York University Downtown Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   During the two years that Penn worked at the company, Depository
Trust, in Lower Manhattan, she would regularly descend to the
basement vaults, said Stuart Z. Goldstein, a spokesman for the
Depository Trust and Clearing Corp., the overseeing holding
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The depository has been around for 25-plus years,'' Goldstein
said, ``and I don't know of a single incident to my knowledge where
something like this has occurred.'' He added that at least 20
employees entered the vault each day.
</P>
<P>
   A Fire Department spokesman, Lt. Frank Gribbon, said that a
preliminary application to change the fire suppression system from
a Halon gas system to the carbon dioxide system, which displaces
oxygen in closed spaces, had been filed in 1976 but never followed
up, and that the department had not found any records indicating
approval of the current system.
</P>
<P>
   Gribbon would not comment on the specifics of the system, but
did say that ``one of the key features of any system is the ability
for prompt evacuation.'' He added, ``They make these systems with
the intentions that they will be used properly. This was used
improperly.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein said that Fire Department officials had assured heads
of his company that the system was approved. ``The DTC would never
put in a system like this if it was not authorized by the Fire
Department,'' he said.

SIXTH MURDER CHARGE FILED AGAINST JOHN E. ROBINSON SR. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY RIZZO, RICHARD ESPINOZA and SCOTT CANON  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Serial murder suspect
John Edward Robinson Sr. killed a teen-age mother in 1985 and
brokered the phony adoption of her infant daughter, Johnson County,
Kan., prosecutors alleged Friday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robinson was charged in Johnson County District Court with
first-degree murder for the death of Lisa Stasi, whose body has
never been found, and aggravated interference with parental custody
for taking then 4-month-old Tiffany Stasi out of Kansas and
concealing her whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany, now a teen-ager, is living with the Midwestern couple
who thought they legally adopted her 15 years ago, Johnson County
District Attorney Paul Morrison said. The couple, who knew Robinson
before they adopted the girl, gave Robinson money that they thought
was to cover legitimate adoption fees, Morrison said. Prosecutors
do not believe money was the main motive in Tiffany's
disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   The girl is aware of the investigation that led to Friday's
charges and is struggling with the horror of the situation,
Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   He said authorities did not think that the couple had any
knowledge that the adoption was not legal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is paperwork that would appear to be genuine if you
didn't know any better,'' Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's attorneys declined to comment Friday about the new
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany's family released a statement through FBI Special Agent
Dirk Tarpley and asked for the media's cooperation in protecting
the girl from publicity. Morrison said he and the adoptive family
are pleased that media have been restrained in their coverage of
the girl.
</P>
<P>
   Last month The Kansas City Star learned that investigators were
exploring whether a girl who had just completed her freshman year
at a public high school was Tiffany living under a different name.
The Star then located the family. Until Friday the family's
attorney would say only that the couple was cooperating with law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The family never hid Tiffany's adoption from her and had planned
to help if she wanted to find her blood relatives when she got
older, the statement said. At least one biological parent's name
was on the ``adoption papers,'' but Morrison wouldn't say whether
it was Lisa Stasi. The family said in their statement that they
didn't know who Tiffany's birth parents were.
</P>
<P>
   Now people are trying to keep the girl's life as settled as
possible. Morrison wants to try to limit Tiffany's involvement in
the investigation. He said his office might help arrange a meeting
between the girl and her blood relatives, who say they do not want
to disrupt her life by seeking custody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody wants the best for this kid,'' Morrison
said. Grandmother feels hurt
</P>
<P>
   Friday was full of conflicted, often painful emotions for Lisa
Stasi's mother, Pat Sylvester of Huntsville, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   News that a man was charged with her daughter's murder, a death
she had suspected for 15 years, brought her mild relief that
justice might be at hand. But, Sylvester said, she's not ready to
accept the idea that her daughter has died without the discovery of
a body.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless they know something that they're not telling us, that
doesn't tell us that she's dead,'' Sylvester said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   As for her granddaughter, she's happy to be told the girl is
definitely alive. But Sylvester said she feels cheated at missing
out on most of the teen-ager's childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fair,'' she said. ``I'm mostly hurting. I'm not
really angry at anybody but Robinson....(But) I'm more hurt than
angry.''
</P>
<P>
   She was especially troubled to think that because the adoptive
parents knew Robinson, he might have had contact with the girl over
the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That bothers me more than I can tell you,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Klinginsmith of Lenexa, Kan., Stasi's sister-in-law,
attended the news conference in Overland Park, Kan. She said
afterward that she was relieved to learn that Tiffany was alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know she's beautiful because her mother was beautiful,''
said Klinginsmith, who is the sister of Carl Stasi, Tiffany's
father. ``We have a big family,'' she said, and ``we all want to
see her.''
</P>
<P>
   Klinginsmith reported the disappearance of Lisa and Tiffany
Stasi to authorities in 1985. All this time, she said, she has
wondered what happened to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thought about her (Tiffany) every day,'' she said. ``It's
something you carry with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Klinginsmith said she wanted Tiffany to know that ``we all love
her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad that my niece is alive and I just want to see
her,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Klinginsmith attended the news conference with her 14-year-old
son, Paul, who is Tiffany's cousin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is right about her age,'' she said. ``He is all excited''
to meet her.
</P>
<P>
   Klinginsmith said she was leaving it up to Carl Stasi to take
the initiative regarding a possible meeting with Tiffany.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Stasi, of Kirksville, was married to Lisa at the time she
disappeared, although he has recalled signing what he thought were
divorce papers some time later.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, he declined to comment other than to say that
learning that his daughter is alive and that he might meet her ``is
the best news I've had in 15 years.''
</P>
<P>
   His attorney said Stasi is inclined to let the courts deal with
Robinson and let the adoptive parents care for the girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to let the law enforcement and investigators do
their work,'' said attorney Seth Shumaker.
</P>
<P>
   Stasi would like to know more about his daughter and,
eventually, form a relationship, he said. But Shumaker said
Morrison is handling the unique and delicate situation well, in a
way that makes it ``as painless as possible'' for the girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would certainly like to know more, but we're starting to
get some answers and that's more than we got 15 years ago,''
Shumaker said.  &LR; brk:2 states involved
</P>
<P>
   Stasi is the sixth woman in two states whom Robinson is charged
with killing. The 56-year-old Olathe, Kan., resident is facing a
possible death sentence in Missouri and Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of five of the women were discovered in early June on
property owned or rented by Robinson in Linn County, Kan., and Cass
County.
</P>
<P>
   Cass County prosecutors have charged him in the deaths of
Beverly Bonner, Sheila Faith and her teen-age daughter, Debbie
Faith. All three vanished in 1994, and their bodies were discovered
in a Raymore storage locker.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of Izabela Lewicka and Suzette Trouten were found on
Linn County farm property owned by Robinson, but the murder charges
were filed in Johnson County because prosecutors allege that the
chain of events that led to their deaths began there.
</P>
<P>
   Lewicka disappeared last fall, and Trouten was reported missing
this spring.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of all five women were found in 55-gallon barrels,
and all were killed by being struck on the head.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities also have linked Robinson to two other missing women
who, like Lisa Stasi, disappeared in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison said Friday that police in Lenexa and Overland Park are
continuing to investigate the disappearances of Catherine Clampitt
and Paula Godfrey.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Stasi was 19 in 1985 when she met Robinson, according to
police reports gathered at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital social workers introduced her to Robinson, who
purported to be involved in philanthropic efforts to help young,
unwed mothers, according to court documents and police reports.
</P>
<P>
   He was the last person known to have seen Stasi when she
disappeared on Jan. 9, 1985. Friday's charge alleges that she was
killed on or about Jan. 10 of that year. She was reported missing
on Jan. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Overland Park police and the FBI investigated their
disappearance, but no charges could be brought.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't have been possible to prosecute then, with much
less evidence,'' Overland Park Police Chief John Douglass said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's next court appearance in Johnson County is scheduled
Aug. 23, to address motions filed by his attorneys from the Kansas
Death Penalty Defense Unit.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Evans, who heads the unit, declined to comment about the new
charges filed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary hearing in Johnson County is scheduled Oct. 2.
Missouri officials have said they will take the case after the
Kansas prosecution is completed.

STATE TREASURER SAYS NCAA OWES KANSAS NEARLY $1.9 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN L. PETTERSON  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   TOPEKA, Kan. _ State Treasurer Tim
Shallenburger on Friday said the NCAA owed Kansas nearly $1.9
million in unclaimed property, penalties and interest, and he
promised a lawsuit to collect if necessary.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly all of the money represents money collected by the
National Collegiate Athletic Association for Final Four basketball
tickets between 1985 and 1995, Shallenburger said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that because of faulty return addresses, some fans
never got their tickets or refunds. Since then, the association has
held the ticket money in its bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement Friday, the association acknowledged it
had failed to follow the state's unclaimed property law, but
contended the amount owed was only about 25 percent of what the
state was seeking. The NCAA said it would pay the state as soon as
an amount was agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
   Shallenburger said Kansas had attempted unsuccessfully on two
earlier occasions since 1997 to collect the money, but was ignored
by the collegiate athletics watchdog agency, which moved its
headquarters last year from Overland Park, Kan., to Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Shallenburger, who said he's prepared to go to court for the
money plus an additional 25 percent penalty, said in no way was
this in retaliation for the organization's decision to leave
Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Shallenburger said he already had imposed $33,000 in penalties
on the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never before imposed the penalty provided by law, and I
regret that I must do so today,'' he said. ``But when an
organization flagrantly violates the law and ignores repeated
warnings to come into compliance, I am left with no choice.''
</P>
<P>
   In its written statement, the NCAA said: ``Although we have no
record of receiving letters from the state in 1997 and 1998 on this
matter, we should have been complying with the law all along.''
</P>
<P>
   It promised to make full payment to the state once there is
agreement on the amount owed.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of the $1,881,682.86 the treasurer's office contends
the NCAA owes, the organization said the amount should be only
$475,000, including interest.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how the NCAA's ticket system works:
</P>
<P>
   People wanting tickets to Final Four basketball games send
payment for up to two tickets, along with a $2 non-refundable
service charge for each ticket, to the NCAA. A lottery is held, and
if the person is selected, tickets are mailed to the indicated
return address.
</P>
<P>
   Those who aren't selected get their money back.
</P>
<P>
   In cases where the NCAA can't return the money or send tickets
because of invalid or missing return addresses, the money is held
in the NCAA accounts.
</P>
<P>
   After a period of years, the money held for owners who cannot be
located or identified must be turned over to the state treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   A state-hired auditing firm from Boston spent the last six
months going over NCAA books at its Indianapolis headquarters. The
treasurer's office received the completed audit about a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Shallenburger said $1.1 million of the amount sought is
attributable to outstanding ticket refunds.
</P>
<P>
   NCAA said in its statement that the auditors erroneously
included in their calculations money from television, merchandise,
concessions and sources other than ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, the NCAA said it had been cooperating with the
state's auditors and ``believed we were engaged in a process to
reach resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   It said it had expected to discuss the audit with the auditing
firm before payment was demanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Less than 24 hours after providing us with initial
notification of the amount the state intends to pursue, and with no
opportunity to discuss findings, the state makes a public
announcement,'' the NCAA said.
</P>
<P>
   Shallenburger said he expects the NCAA to waste no time in
making the payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe it's to its benefit to have this issue hanging
out there,'' the treasurer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NCAA was created, in part, to inspire young people to fair
play,'' the treasurer said. ``I ask no more than that of the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a shame that an organization that sits in judgment of
our institutions of higher learning would, itself, violate laws for
its own benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the treasurer's office is holding about $90 million
in unclaimed property for about 375,000 owners.
</P>
<P>
   The money comes from such things as abandoned bank accounts,
uncashed dividend and interest checks, unreturned utility or rent
deposits and contents of safe-deposit boxes.
</P>
<P>
   The treasurer's office is charged by law with attempting to find
the owners of the property and returning it to them. If owners
cannot be located, the property remains in the state treasury.

TEEN SWEPT AWAY IN DRAINAGE DITCH, BUT SURVIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERICA WOOD  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ With the power still
out from an earlier storm and no phone, Eric Thomas quickly grew
bored at home.
<TEXT>
<P>
   So the 14-year-old and a friend did what they had done all
summer _ they headed to the Town Fork Greenway near 56th Street and
Agnes Avenue to play basketball.
</P>
<P>
   While the two were playing, the ball rolled near a drainage
ditch.
</P>
<P>
   Eric fell in while trying to retrieve it.
</P>
<P>
   He floated a quarter-mile north to the back yard of Mitchell
McHenry, who heard the boy's cries for help and called 911.
</P>
<P>
   McHenry and his sons rushed outside and found Eric, holding on
to a tunnel wall in 2 to 3 feet of water.
</P>
<P>
   The strong currents had ripped away Eric's shorts and made it
impossible for him to stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad I heard him holler,'' McHenry said. ``If I
hadn't been here, he wouldn't have made it.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Fire Department arrived less than five minutes later,
officials lowered a 12- to 16-foot ladder into the water.
</P>
<P>
   A cold and shaken Eric climbed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like, `I got to find something to hang on to so I won't
drown,' '' Eric said.
</P>
<P>
   He was taken to Children's Mercy Hospital, where he was treated
for minor injuries and released. The doctor gave Eric a new ball to
replace the one he lost.
</P>
<P>
   His mother was relieved to hear her son was OK, though she
wondered why there was a basketball court near a drainage ditch
with no fence to separate them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't doing anything but playing basketball,'' Donna
Thomas said. ``They didn't think it was a risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dangerous for that (drainage ditch) and the park to be so
close together.''

EDITORIAL OBSERVER : CITY PINS HOPES ON THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By BRENT STAPLES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Philadelphia sandwich delicacy known as the cheese steak is
made of thinly sliced beef that is quick-grilled in light oil,
topped with fried onions, cheese and peppers and served hot and
dripping on what locals call a hoagie roll, elsewhere known as
Italian bread or a hero roll. At hoagie shops in South Philly, the
waitresses address you as ``hon'' _ as in ``Whatcha want on your
cheese steak, hon?'' _ as though they have known you all their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor John Street counts every calorie, and has replaced his
predecessor's candy dish with a bowl of fresh fruit. But
Philadelphia is nonetheless counting on the cholesterol-drenched
cheese steak to win hearts and minds during next week's Republican
National Convention, the city's first in more than 50 years. Nearly
bankrupt at the start of the '90s, Philadelphia has fought its way
back, revitalizing its downtown and stanching job loss for the
first time in decades.
</P>
<P>
   The austere Street and his voluble predecessor, Ed Rendell, have
jointly promoted the Republican Convention as the moment of
Philadelphia's rebirth and a chance to show off the new city to
visitors and the press. But when the conventioneers leave, the
urban wastelands in the shadow of downtown's glittering towers will
remain. Reclaiming those wastelands _ and persuading Philadelphians
who are still leaving the city to stay _ will be considerably more
difficult than renovating the city center.
</P>
<P>
   The poverty and industrial decline that struck most big cities
in the 1960s and '70s were particularly devastating to Philly,
partly because the city was so poorly managed. In the '70s that
management was synonymous with Frank Rizzo, the racially divisive
police chief whose Bull Connor style got him elected to three terms
as mayor. His pledge during a re-election campaign to make ``Attila
the Hun look like a faggot'' mortified the city's remaining
corporate elite and worsened racial tensions that were already bad.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; City politics turned macabre under Mayor Wilson Goode, who was
installed as the first black mayor in 1983. This mild-mannered
former city manager seemed a safe choice after Rizzo, yet it was
his police department that in 1985 bombed the home of a black
radical cult Move. The Move bombing, which burned 60 houses along
West Philadelphia's Osage Avenue, demoralized the city and became a
national metaphor for stumbling municipal leadership.
</P>
<P>
   When Rendell, a former Philadelphia district attorney, was
elected mayor in 1992 the city had a $250 million deficit and its
bonds were rated below junk status. Financial World magazine ranked
it as the worst-managed of America's 30 largest cities. On the
verge of bankruptcy, the city threatened to pay its workers in
scrip. Thus chastened, the unions accepted budget cuts and aus-
terity.
</P>
<P>
   Rendell persuaded residents to see hope where none seemed to
exist. He talked of the greatness and wonder of the city, even as
downtown Philadelphia hollowed out, leaving many great buildings
empty.
</P>
<P>
   The rebirth of that downtown is partly a testament to Rendell's
wide-eyed optimism, and at his instigation the city has come to
view the convention as a coming-out party at which the new
Philadelphia can replace the dismal past with a glittering new
vision of the future.
</P>
<P>
   But only in the last three years has the city proper experienced
a net gain in jobs, reversing a trend that is decades old.
Philadelphia has lost more than 167,000 people over the last nine
years, more than any city of comparable size. That means that 10.6
percent of the population has chosen to go elsewhere. Any attempt
to stop these defections must focus on the schools, which are
clearly among the worst in the country, even after improvements
posted by the celebrated city school superintendent David Hornbeck.
</P>
<P>
   Hornbeck left his job after he seemed to liken Pennsylvania's
treatment of minority school children to that of South Africa under
apartheid and filed a federal lawsuit accusing the state of
systemically underfinancing schools attended by black children. For
the Republican state government in Harrisburg this was the last
straw. But financial statistics lent credence to this view and made
it clear that chronic underfinancing was inhibiting a full recovery
in the city. Until the schools are made decent, the middle class
will continue to ebb away.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the progress under Rendell, there were more than 35,000
abandoned cars littering city streets when he left office,
contributing to a sense of hopelessness and desolation. Street has
towed nearly all of these away, but it takes only a short drive
from City Hall to find urban deterioration at its most extreme,
with open-air drug marts and consecutive blocks of decay. The
Street administration has proposed floating $250 million in bonds
to eliminate this blight.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's city center will be on display for conventioneers
as a shining image of accomplishment. But reclaiming the city's
far-flung neighborhoods will require another round of leadership,
money and heartfelt dedication.  &QL;

BUSH AND CHENEY SWING THROUGH MISSOURI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIT WAGAR  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   JOPLIN, Mo. _ Seeking to build a
pre-convention surge of momentum, George W. Bush on Friday brought
his quest for the presidency to staunchly Republican southwest
Missouri, where he showed off his new running mate and took some
pointed jabs at President Clinton.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bush boasted that in former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, he
had found a man who has Washington experience, but was not of
Washington, a man who would be his partner, but who could be
president if needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is plain-spoken and a man who speaks from the heart,'' Bush
said. ``He is a man who knows what the definition of `is' is.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd, gathered in the Leggett &AMP; Platt Athletic Center at
Missouri Southern State College, roared its approval. Bush's
reference to Clinton's hair-splitting testimony during the Monica
Lewinsky scandal was a frequent refrain during his speech, which
lasted less than half an hour.
</P>
<P>
   But he also made a strong pitch for his so-called compassionate
conservatism. He urged listeners to find ways to include everyone
in the nation's prosperity and to ensure every child has a good
education and a loving home.
</P>
<P>
   And he hit on his key campaign themes: Cut taxes to return the
federal budget surplus to taxpayers; let young workers place part
of their Social Security taxes into the stock market; and build up
the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's rallies Friday in Springdale, Ark., and Joplin kicked off
a five-day swing through key states as he and Cheney make their way
to Philadelphia for the GOP convention next week. Next up are
appearances in Kentucky, three in Ohio and one in West Virginia
before Bush arrives for the convention.
</P>
<P>
   The swing through the nation's heartland was aimed at places
like Missouri and Kentucky, states that went Democratic in the last
two presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking it to the people,'' Bush declared.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Catherine Hanaway, coordinator for Bush's campaign in
Missouri, said Bush chose Joplin for his pre-convention tour for
two reasons. It was the only significant population center in
Missouri that he had not visited this year. And he knew the town
would give him a rousing sendoff, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense, he is preaching to the choir,'' Hanaway said.
``But even a choir needs a conductor. Personal visits mean a lot to
people....He's building momentum for the convention.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Marvin Singleton, a Joplin Republican, put it another
way: ``Bush is an old oil man. He knows how to hit a gusher.''
</P>
<P>
   Police estimated the crowd at about 5,000, but even Republican
partisans said they doubted it was much more than 4,000. It was a
spirited crowd, with a lot of foot-stomping and waving of signs,
both printed and homemade.
</P>
<P>
   Several other GOP candidates spoke before Bush. But Singleton
said it wasn't clear how well Bush's visit might translate into
votes for Republicans in close state races for governor, treasurer
and secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers carefully controlled the invited group so the result
was like a mailing to supporters, he said. In addition, some
businesses let workers leave early to attend the rally.
</P>
<P>
   Bush tapped into the anti-Clinton mood of the crowd by making
several references to the need for honor and integrity in the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, in a brief introduction of Bush, said they had
``embarked on a great crusade to restore integrity and decency'' to
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Bush promised to meet all obligations of Social Security, even
while letting younger workers invest part of their contributions
outside the system. Vice President Al Gore has called Bush's plan a
risky scheme that could put Social Security benefits in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Other parts of his speech moved away from policy to add a
sentimental touch. Bush said he always gives parents this bit of
advice: ``The most important job you'll ever have is to love your
children with all your heart and all your soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said every child should receive a good education, but said
school officials often give up on struggling students too early.
And he called on teachers to get such children extra help before
the damage is irreparable.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said he would try to keep Washington out of local
schools and return more control of federal money to local
districts.

ACLU, CITY FORGE AGREEMENT ON DNC PROTEST SITE &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BETH BARRETT 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Democratic National Convention protesters claimed
total victory Friday when Los Angeles city officials agreed to set
up a public assembly area in front of Staples Center within earshot
of delegates.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was negotiated with the American Civil Liberties
Union after a federal judge struck down as unconstitutional city
plans to keep the expected 10,000 to 50,000 protesters a block away
from the convention.
</P>
<P>
   If approved by the federal judge, protests using a sound system
could be held across the street from Staples Center's entrance,
some 750 feet closer than previously planned and under less
restrictive conditions. It will require a much larger contingent of
police to control the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased,'' ACLU attorney Daniel Tokaji said of the
stipulation filed in federal court Friday afternoon. ``The voice of
the people will not be silenced during the Democratic National
Convention.''
</P>
<P>
   All parties said Friday they were confident the agreement would
satisfy the First Amendment issues raised July 19 by U.S. District
Judge Gary A. Feess in ruling the original plan violated
demonstrators' rights of expression since they couldn't be seen or
heard by delegates if restricted to the planned protest zone at
Georgia Street and Olympic Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   The stipulated agreement also addresses activities at downtown
Pershing Square, granting protesters more time to obtain permits
and the right to a stage and a sound system. It also sets the
parameters on some marches and rallies, in particular keeping
Olympic Boulevard clear of demonstrators as sought by the city.
</P>
<P>
   While law enforcement agencies also have signed off on the plan
despite concern about the potential for violence and disruption,
Los Angeles Police Department officials said the closeness of
protesters to the delegates will require added security at a
greater expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will absolutely need additional resources,'' said LAPD
spokesman Cmdr. David Kalish. ``This will create additional
challenges for us, but we'll comply. We're committed to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensitive to charges they were limiting free speech because of
the original plan they helped formulate, the Democratic National
Convention helped to broker the deal this week by offering the new
location at parking lot 3, a property it controls during the
convention, for the demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased with the resolution,'' said Peter Ragone,
Democratic National Convention Committee spokesman. ``We're pleased
the ACLU and various organizations accepted our offer. The
agreement represents an effort to assure everyone's First Amendment
rights are expressed, while public safety issues are balanced.''
</P>
<P>
   In a signed declaration, Deputy CEO and Director of Logistics
for the DNCC Louis S. Vasta said the Secret Service and LAPD were
consulted, and there were assurances that pedestrians and cars in
the Staples Center area will be adequately protected.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Deputy City Attorney Timothy McOsker said the city
ultimately was convinced the stipulation was proper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It fairly balances the interests of free speech as well as the
need for security, health and safety around the site,'' McOsker
said. ``The (protest) area is within sight and earshot. It fits the
case. People can be heard and seen by the delegates.''
</P>
<P>
   The significance of the new zone that fronts on 11th Street is
that it's directly across from the Staples Center entrance, running
west from Figueroa Street for 180 feet. A ``media village'' will
take up the rest of the block to the west, but will be within the
secure zone.
</P>
<P>
   ACLU attorneys said the demonstrators will easily be able to
shout through the cement and chain-link fence - all that will
separate them from Staples Center. The stipulation gives
demonstrators the right to set up a sound system in the protest
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our clients' viewpoint, it's a good opportunity to reach
the delegates,'' said civil rights attorney Carol Sobel. ``The only
thing between them and the delegates is the mesh fence. It puts us
within shouting distance, just two traffic lanes away.''
</P>
<P>
   First Amendment experts said the stipulation would take some
dissecting but that initially it appeared the coalition of labor
and civil rights groups had won the legal battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like the ACLU got quite a lot,'' said Eugene Volokh,
a UCLA law professor who specializes in First Amendment law.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the matter, Volokh said, the Constitution grants
the right to citizens to speak on public streets, and that the fear
or expectation of violence cannot be used to curtail that right in
advance of an event.
</P>
<P>
   Volokh said serious security concerns may still remain, and that
some of those can be met through appropriate restrictions, such as
limits on rallies or marches that might unduly block traffic. But
in general, he said, it is up to law enforcement to counter those
with appropriate means.
</P>
<P>
   The stipulation also addresses permit issues, particularly at
Pershing Square, which previously was a flash point in the debate
between downtown business owners who feared vandalism during
protests and civil rights groups that argued they had a right to
assemble there.
</P>
<P>
   Under the stipulation, the city cannot require demonstrators to
apply far in advance for permits but must be flexible up until the
convention. Furthermore, groups that have permits will have access
to a stage and sound system, which they can operate from 9 a.m.
until 9 p.m., the agreement says.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes Pershing Square the Hyde Park it claims to be,''
Sobel said.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown business representatives declined comment.
