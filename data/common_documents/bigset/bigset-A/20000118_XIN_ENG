<HEADLINE> U.N. Supports Setting Up Peacekeeping Center in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 17 -- The United Nations is to lend full
support to Nepal's proposal to set up a regional peacekeeping
training center in Nepal, a U.N. high-ranking peacekeeping
official said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Assistant Secretary-General Young Jin Choi told reporters
that U.N. welcomes Nepal's initiative to establish a South Asian
peacekeeping training center in Nepal, adding that such a training
center is necessary in the region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking Sunday at the opening ceremony of the "South Asian
Peacekeeping Multi-platoon Training Event," Chief of the Army
Staffs General of the Royal Nepalese Army Prajjwalla Rana proposed
to make the present training site a South Asian regional
peacekeeping training center to "enable Nepal to exchange our
professional experiences in our endeavors and pursuits to
universal peace."
</P>
<P>
The multi-platoon training event co-organized by Nepal and the
United States has brought together peacekeeping soldiers of Nepal,
Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and the United States for a two-week
training that aims to improve the interoperability of peacekeepers
from different countries.
</P>
<P>
Choi said as one of the "most enthusiastic supporters of the U.
N.peacekeeping operations," Nepal has the experience of conducting
such training center.
</P>
<P>
Nepal is among the top 15 to 20 contributors of manpower to the
U.N.peacekeeping operations. Altogether 35,000 Nepalese soldiers
have served in the U.N. peacekeeping forces since 1958.
</P>
<P>
Setting up of the regional peacekeeping training centers in
different parts of the world is a fairly new concept. Such centers
have so far been set up in Norway and Sweden.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leaders Congratulate 50th Anniversary of China-Vietnam Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Communist Party
of China and the state recently congratulated their Vietnamese
counterparts on the 50th anniversary of the founding of the
diplomatic relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist
Party of China and President of the People's Republic of China
Jiang Zemin, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress Li Peng, and Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji jointly
sent a congratulatory message to General Secretary of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam Le Kha Phieu,
Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai and Chairman of National
Assembly of Vietnam Nong Duc Manh to mark the occasion.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leaders said that over the past 50 years, the
Chinese and Vietnamese people have extended mutual sympathy and
mutual support to each other in their revolutionary struggle and
socialist construction, and have developed profound friendship.
</P>
<P>
Particularly over the past eight years since the normalization
of China-Vietnam ties, the relations between the two communist
parties and the two nations have been fully restored and undergone
smooth development. Their friendly exchanges and cooperation in
all spheres have been steadily deepened.
</P>
<P>
Last February, the two general secretaries of the two parties
held a historic meeting in Beijing and set a framework for the
development of bilateral ties in the new century, thus ushering
the relations between the two parties and two nations into a new
stage of development.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu Rongji paid a successful visit to Vietnam in early
December last year and breathed new life into the comprehensive
cooperation between the two countries. Not long ago, both
countries formally signed the land border treaty, symbolizing that
a peaceful, friendly and stable border between them will be
brought into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The message said that the course of the development of the
diplomatic ties between the two countries has demonstrated that
the constant consolidation and development of bilateral friendly
ties fully accord with the fundamental and long-term interests of
both nations and their people, and are also conducive to the peace,
stability and development of the region and the whole world.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese government have
always attached great importance to the Chinese-Vietnamese
traditional friendship and will continue to be committed to the
consolidation and development of the good-neighborly and
cooperative ties between the two nations, said the message.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Arrives in London for Official Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo
arrived here Tuesday for a five-day official good-will visit to
the United Kingdom at the invitation of British Deputy Prime
Minister John Prescott.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement released at the airport upon his arrival
,Wu said, "I hope my current visit will contribute to the
enhancement of the friendship between our two peoples and the
furtherance of the friendly relations and cooperation between our
two countries."
</P>
<P>
In recent years, with the joint efforts of both sides, China-UK
relations have continued to grow and entered a new stage of
development, he said, adding that Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
state visit to Britain last October was crowned with a complete
success, bringing bilateral friendly relations and cooperation to
a new high.
</P>
<P>
China attaches importance to its relationship with Britain and
stands ready to work together with the British side to continue to
advance bilateral ties in the new century, he added.
</P>
<P>
Wu was greeted at the airport by Mrs. Anne Morrison, the
British foreign secretary's representative, and Ma Zhengang,
Chinese ambassador to Britain.
</P>
<P>
Among the Chinese vice-premier's entourage are Gui Shiyong,
director of the State Council's research office; Wang Wanbin, vice
minister of the State Economic and Trade Commission; and Zhang
Xiang, vice minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Britain is the first leg of Wu's three-nation Europe tour which
will also take him to Belgium and Switzerland. He will also visit
the European Union headquarters and attend the annual meeting of
the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

<HEADLINE> Seleznyov Reelected Russian Duma Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian Communist Party leader
Gennady Seleznyov, who headed the second State Duma or lower house
of parliament, was re-elected speaker of the third Duma Tuesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
He was nominated by the Communist Party faction and was
supported by 285 deputies, with two votes against and seven
abstentions.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, after all contenders, including Sergei Stepashin from
the Yabloko bloc, Yevgeny Primakov from Fatherland-All Russia and
Viktor Pokhmelkin from the Union of Right-Wing Forces, announced
their withdrawal from the race late Tuesday, Seleznyov remained
the only candidate to chair the State Duma.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov was born in the town of Serov, Sverdlovsk region, on
November 6, 1947, and graduated from the Leningrad State
University in 1974.
</P>
<P>
He was a young communist league functionary from 1968 to 1980,
editor-in-chief of the Komsomolskaya Pravda daily, the
Uchitelskaya Gazeta weekly, the Pravda daily and the Pravda Rossii
weekly and a member of the State Duma of the first and second
convocations.
</P>
<P>
He worked as speaker of the lower house of the second
convocation during 1996-1999, and was elected deputy of the State
Duma of the third convocation in December 1999.
</P>
<P>
He has been member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of
the Russian Communist Party since 1996. He is married and has a
daughter.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Early National Reconciliation in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shen Guofang, deputy Chinese permanent representative to the
United Nations, told an open U.N. Security Council debate on
Angola that to impose sanctions on the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) is not just the objective,
and this should be the necessary means for the final political
settlement of the Angola conflict.
</P>
<P>
"It is our hope that the international community can take
concerted efforts for a coordinated action to be on the road
towards the national reconciliation as soon as possible by
strengthening sanctions to force UNITA to lay down weapons and end
hostilities," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is known to all that UNITA should bear the primary
responsibility for the current situation in Angola," Shen said. "
UNITA has been long refusing to honor its commitment in the Lusaka
Protocol, and to carry out relevant Security Council resolutions."
</P>
<P>
UNITA used the areas under its control for illegal trade of
diamond for arms, and staged attacks against civilians and even
the U.N. humanitarian workers, Shen said, adding that UNITA should
be condemned and sanctions should be imposed on it.
</P>
<P>
Recently, more consensus was achieved in the international
community on the sanctions against UNITA, and such sanctions also
resulted in unprecedented effects, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
"China, as always, supports the active and constructive role by
the United Nations in the Angolan peace process," he said.

<HEADLINE> WTO Chief Says No Sign of Early Trade Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- World Trade Organization (WTO)
Director-General Mike Moore said here Tuesday he didn't see sign
that governments were willing to make concessions to get stalled
world trade talks back on track.
</P>
<P>
During his visit of Brussels where he met EU Trade Commissioner
Pascal Lamy, Moore told reporters that it could be a slow process.
He has been holding intensive diplomatic contacts to try to revive
efforts to launch a new round of global trade talks after the
failure of last month's WTO conference in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
Moore said there was "not a lot" of sign yet that countries
were prepared to give way on their demands. "Everyone wishes the
other chap had been more flexible," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Seattle conference, which had been expected to launch a new
trade round, foundered amid huge street protests and deep
divisions over agriculture, anti-dumping rules, minimum labor
standards and other issues.
</P>
<P>
Moore said the World Economic Forum later this month in the
Swiss city of Davos and next month's Bangkok summit of the United
Nations trade and development agency UNCTAD -- both of which he
will attend -- would be important opportunities for talks among
trade officials.
</P>
<P>
"But I would not see any breakthrough-type meetings at dawn.
This is going to be painful, slow, deliberate and focused," he
said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Council to Meet on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Russia, China and France have voiced their opposition to the
nominee.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council is to meet in private session to see what
steps to take next.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Annan was aware of Russian and
Chinese reservations when he nominated Ekeus Monday and he still
had hopes for Ekeus.
</P>
<P>
"I do not think in his own mind he has excluded the possibility
there might still be some understanding reached in the council in
support of his nominee," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Ekeus was the first chief of the UNSCOM, serving from 1991 to
1997.
</P>
<P>
There has been no arms inspection for Iraq since December 1998
when the United States and Britain launched military strikes
against the country. The UNSCOM withdrew from Iraq days before the
military strikes. Iraq has barred it from returning since then.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Conduct Second Test of National Missile Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 55-kilogram missile, "smart rock," will steer itself into the
path of a mock warhead about 224 kilometers above the central
Pacific Ocean, creating a collision that would reduce both objects
to space dust.
</P>
<P>
The launch is to take place sometime during a four-hour period
that starts at 9 p.m. EST (0200 GMT).
</P>
<P>
If Tuesday's test succeeds, it could lead to a decision by
President Bill Clinton as early as this summer to commit the
United States officially to building a defense against missile "
attacks by other countries" at a cost of at least 12.7 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
If the test fails, there will be another chance as early as
April to demonstrate that strategic missile defense is feasible,
one of several criteria the president has set for deciding whether
to deploy it.
</P>
<P>
In his 2001 budget, to be disclosed on February 7, Clinton is
expected to ask Congress for an additional 2.2 billion dollars for
the program. That would buy an arsenal of 100 interceptors and pay
for more testing and spare parts.
</P>
<P>
If Clinton gives the go-ahead this summer, a missile defense
could be ready to begin operating in 2005, although some Pentagon
officials closely involved in the program think that is too
ambitious a timetable.
</P>
<P>
The first major test of the missile interceptor -- known as a "
kill vehicle," or by its Pentagon nickname, "smart rock" -- was
last October 2.
</P>
<P>
Arms control experts said that the U.S. decision to set up the
NMD will aggravate the arms race, thus affecting world peace and
stability.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Income Gap Broadens Amid Economic Boom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The income gap between the
richest and poorest Americans widened in the 1990s despite the U.S.
economic boom, two Washington-based think tanks said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The earnings for the poorest fifth of American families rose
less than 1 percent between 1988 and 1998 but jumped 15 percent
for the richest fifth, according to a new study released by the
Economic Policy Institute and the Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities.
</P>
<P>
The average annual earnings of families in the top fifth of
income distribution was 137,480 U.S. dollars in the late 1990s.
This was more than 10 times that of the poorest fifth of families,
which had an average income of 12,990 dollars.
</P>
<P>
In 46 states the gap between the incomes of the richest 20
percent of families and those of the poorest 20 percent is wider
than it was two decades ago, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report said the growing income gap in most states was due
chiefly to the growth of wage inequality.
</P>
<P>
Wages at the bottom and middle of the wage scale have only
recently grown after having stagnated or declined over the last
two decades, said the report, titled "Pulling Apart: A State-by-
State Analysis of Income Trends."
</P>
<P>
The wages of the very highest paid employees, however, have
grown "significantly," the report said.
</P>
<P>
It named several factors as contributing to growing wage
inequality. These included globalization, the decline of
manufacturing jobs and the expansion of low-wage service jobs,
immigration, the lower real value of the minimum wage and fewer
and weaker trade unions.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Calls for Poverty Reduction in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi Tuesday called on African leaders to make deliberate and
sustainable efforts to check the rising poverty in sub-Saharan
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Moi made the remarks as he addressed the summit of the African
heads of state and government on economic growth and poverty
reduction in sub- Saharan Africa in Libreville, Gabon, according
to the Kenyan Presidential Press Service.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that due to a myriad of problems such as
the marginalization of the continent, declining resource flows and
the increase in debt burden, poverty is rising at an alarming
proportion in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"This situation should immediately arrested lest it exploded
into a major source of socio-political instability," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, the president was optimistic that African has a great
future if all the available resources are well utilized and
appropriate policies put into place.
</P>
<P>
It is time for African governments to leave the job of carrying
out business activities to the private sector which could most
effectively and efficiently carry out this role, Moi pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The president also underlined the importance of peace, saying
that no efforts should be spared in eliminating conflicts and wars
which cause instability on the continent.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the development of the continent would
require support from other development partners.
</P>
<P>
The necessary environment for economic growth should be created
in a bid to look forward to the flow of new investments, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Libreville summit on poverty reduction and economic growth
was aimed at identifying and kick-starting an economic strategy to
match Africa with the world's industrialized countries.

<HEADLINE> Bush Arrives in Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. President George
Bush arrived in Kuwait Tuesday for a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Bush, who was invited here by Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed
Al-Sabah, will hold meetings with senior Kuwaiti officials and will
also visit Ahmad Al-Jaber Air Base, where U.S. air forces are
stationed, the official news agency Kuna reported.
</P>
<P>
Bush was U.S. president when the U.S.-led multi-national force
liberated Kuwait from Iraq's seven-month occupation in 1990-1991.
</P>
<P>
His visit almost coincided with the ninth anniversary of the
Operation Desert Storm that the allied forces launched on January
17, 1991 to eject the Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
When Bush first visited Kuwait on April 14, 1993, he received a
hero-like welcome and was decorated by Jaber with "Mubarak Al-
Khabeer Medal," the highest civil decoration in Kuwait. Bush's last
visit to the Gulf emirate was in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according Kuna, former British prime minister John
Major will arrive here later in the day to join Bush for the visit.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti PM Returns Home After Medical Check-up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Crown Prince and
Prime Minister Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah returned
home Tuesday after more than a month's stay in the United States
and Britain, where he underwent medical tests.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Saad left for the U.S. last December 7 to receive medical
check-ups and treatment in response to advice from his doctors.
</P>
<P>
He flew back to London on December 22 for recuperation following
positive tests in the U.S., said the Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Saad spent more than two months in Britain last summer,
but he cut short his stay, despite his doctors' persuasion, and
returned to Kuwait in late October to attend an important
parliament meeting.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Saad, born in 1930, suffered bleeding in the colon more
than two years ago, which Kuwaiti officials said did not call for
much concern.
</P>
<P>
Saad, educated in Kuwait and at Britain's Hendon Police Training
School, started his career with Kuwait's police in 1945. He held
the defense and interior portfolios from mid-1960s to late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
He has been Crown Prince and Prime Minister since 1978. His
father was the late Emir Sheikh Abdullah al-Salem al-Sabah in 1950-
1965, during which Kuwait gained independence from Britain in 1961.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti PM Returns Home After Medical Check-up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Crown Prince and
Prime Minister Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah returned
home Tuesday after more than a month's stay in the United States
and Britain, where he underwent medical tests.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Saad left for the U.S. last December 7 to receive medical
check-ups and treatment in response to advice from his doctors.
</P>
<P>
He flew back to London on December 22 for recuperation following
positive tests in the U.S., said the Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Saad spent more than two months in Britain last summer,
but he cut short his stay, despite his doctors' persuasion, and
returned to Kuwait in late October to attend an important
parliament meeting.
</P>
<P>
There were some speculations about Saad's health condition in
earlier reports by some foreign reporters, but the Kuwaiti
government bluntly rejected those negative allegations.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Saad, born in 1930, suffered bleeding in the colon more
than two years ago, which Kuwaiti officials said did not call for
much concern.
</P>
<P>
Saad, educated in Kuwait and at Britain's Hendon Police Training
School, started his career with Kuwait's police in 1945. He held
the defense and interior portfolios from mid-1960s to late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
He has been Crown Prince and Prime Minister since 1978. His
father was the late Emir Sheikh Abdullah al-Salem al-Sabah in 1950-
1965, during which Kuwait gained independence from Britain in 1961.

<HEADLINE> Italy's Inflation Rate For 1999 Lowest Since 1968 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Consumer prices in Italy for 1999
rose by an average of 1.7 percent, setting the lowest inflation
rate since 1968, when it stood at 1.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The 1.7 percent rate, however, was higher than the government
target for last year of 1.5 percent, with the end-of-the-year
surge in fuel prices blamed for the upturn in consumer prices.
</P>
<P>
The inflation figures came from the national statistic bureau
Istat in its report of last year.
</P>
<P>
Inflation in Italy in 1999 was the lowest in 31 years, despite
the pressure created by rising oil prices towards the end of the
year, but comment on the figures said it was unlikely that the
feat could be repeated this year.
</P>
<P>
"It will be arduous to hit the target of 1.2 percent agreed to
for the year 2000," said Confesercenti, the shopkeepers'
federation, saying that failure to achieve a rate of 1.5 percent
last year was no surprise.
</P>
<P>
"With the inflation inherited from 1999, it would mean a rise
of only 0.2 percent over the year," the organization said.
</P>
<P>
Istat said that, from January to December, inflation rose by 1.
7 percent, but the rise from December to December was 2.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The rate registered 31 years ago, in 1968, was 1.3 percent,
more or less the last year of low inflation before the 1970s and
1980s, when high inflation pushed the peak to 21.2 percent in 1980.
</P>
<P>
According to Confesercenti, the only path is to move for a
reduction in fuel prices as well as the prices charged in the
communications sector, which remain above the European average,
but are to be brought down in the coming months.

<HEADLINE> New Athens Airport to Open Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The new Athens international
airport in Spata, southeast of the Greek capital, will open on
March 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
The Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport, which has a
budget of 658 billion drachmas (about 2.04 billion U.S. dollars),
will have 600 landings and take-offs daily, the semi-official
Athens News Agency (ANA) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
As of December 1999, 90 percent of the work was completed, with
a period of field tests scheduled in the near future. Flight tests
are expected to begin in May or June.
</P>
<P>
When it begins operation in 2001, some 7,000 people are
expected to work at the Spata airport.
</P>
<P>
A portion of a highway linking western Attica prefecture with
the airport will be ready by February 2001, and the Greek
government is also considering linking the airport with a rail
line connected to Athens' new metro network.

<HEADLINE> UAE-Iranian Ties Good Despite Dispute: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
enjoys good relations with Iran although the two countries are
locked in a dispute over three Gulf islands, said a senior UAE
official on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The UAE-Iranian relationship "was and is still very good. The
only problem is the islands issue and all that we want from Iran is
negotiations," said Sheikh Muhammad Bin Rashid al-Maktoum, Dubai
crown prince and UAE defense minister, and quoted by the Kuwait-
based Al Qabas newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Both the UAE and Iran claim full sovereignty over the three
small but strategic Gulf islands of Abu Musa and Greater and Lesser
Tunbs.
</P>
<P>
Iran took the islands in 1971 following the withdrawal of
British forces from the region. Since then the dispute has been the
major hurdle in the development of ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"We need to sit at a negotiation table with goodwill so as to
address all issues regarding the three islands in good faith," the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
He added that if the two sides could not reach an amicable
settlement through negotiations, the case should be referred to the
International Court of Justice in The Hague, a solution that has
been repeatedly advocated by the UAE.
</P>
<P>
The minister also expressed his support for the unity of Iraq,
which has been under U.N. sanctions since it invaded Kuwait in
1990.
</P>
<P>
It is in the interest of Kuwait and Arabs as a whole for Iraq to
remain united, he said, adding "Breaking up Iraq will hurt us all."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he reiterated the UAE's call for the convening of an
Arab summit so as to find comprehensive solutions to Arab problems.
</P>
<P>
"We of the UAE are for a specifically scheduled and regular Arab
summit once or twice a year," he said.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian House to Probe Into Alleged Bribery of PM's Son </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 18 (Xinhua) -- A special committee will soon be
set up in Jordan to investigate whether a son of Prime Minister
Abdel Rauf Rawabdeh had asked for huge bribes from potential
investors.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said Tuesday that the decision was made by the
house of deputies of Jordan (lower house of the parliament), which
is expected to nominate a nine-member committee Wednesday to look
into the allegations against Isaam Rawabdeh, the eldest son of the
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Isaam had been charged for asking for 15 million Jordanian
dinars (some 21 millions U.S. dollars) from two potential investors
of a Gulf state to help them win a contract to build a tourist
village near the Queen Alia international airport, 35 kilometers
south of Amman.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Rawabdeh had denied the charges, but said he
would resign if his son were proven for wrong doings. If proven
otherwise, he challenged those who raised the case to resign.
</P>
<P>
The case was first raised by Deputy Mahmoud Kharabsheh, head of
the legal affairs committee of the house during an ordinary session
in early January. The charges were brought up again by Deputy
Abdullah Akayleh during another house session last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The house deputies said they had evidence to prove the charges.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minster Rawabdeh said last week the allegations were meant
to tarnish the reputation of himself and his family ahead of a
major cabinet reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
However, Rawabdeh saved his premiship during the major shakeup
last Saturday to his 10-month-old government as the kingdom is
emerging from a chronic economic stagnation since the 1990 Gulf
Crisis.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein appointed seven technocrats
as new ministers Saturday to command more support for various
social, economic and administrative reforms carried out by Rawabdeh
who took office on March 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The monarch has the constitutional rights of appointing cabinet
members or dismissing governments.

<HEADLINE> Israel, PNA Reportedly Agree to Speed Up Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Israel and the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) have agreed to speed up their talks to
meet the self-imposed February deadline to reach a framework
agreement on a permanent peace, Israel Radio reports said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have agreed to accelerate the ongoing final-status
talks in an effort to meet the February 13 deadline they set in the
Sharm el Sheikh agreement for a framework accord, the reports
quoted Palestinian sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The next rounds of talks might take place outside the Middle
East region, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
These reports came after Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak held
an unexpected late-night meeting with PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat
Monday at an undisclosed place in central Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli sources said Barak had asked Arafat at the meeting to
agree to delay the mid-February deadline by two months.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Ha'aretz said Tuesday that Barak raised such a
request because the final-status talks were moving at a snail's
pace while the deadline is approaching. Barak also said that it
might be impossible to move forward the Palestinian track quickly
as the Israeli-Syrian talks had entered critical stages, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
Although Palestinian sources admitted that no breakthrough was
made during the four-hour summit meeting, Arafat's top aide Nabil
Abu Rudeineh denied that Barak had asked for a two-month delay on
the framework deadline.
</P>
<P>
The final-status talks, formally launched in November, were
aimed at deciding the final status of the Palestinian entity, the
fate of Jerusalem and Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Tuesday morning, Barak's office said the
two leaders discussed ways of advancing the final-status talks and
the atmosphere was "positive, good and constructive."
</P>
<P>
"The two leaders discussed the next stages of the agreements
between them and ways of advancing them," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place after the next round of Israeli-Syrian
peace talks, due to start on Wednesday in the United States, were
put on hold following disputes between the two sides over the
agenda and some key issues such as borders.
</P>
<P>
Barak originally planned to meet Arafat later this week as
Arafat is in Washington for talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton
and he is expected to hold talks with the Syrian side in
Shepherdstown, West Virginia. But his trip was cancelled because of
snags in the Israeli-Syrian talks.

<HEADLINE> Minister Rules out Possible Split in Iranian Reformist Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 18 (Xinhua) -- A pro-reformist Iranian minister
on Tuesday ruled out a possible split inside the reformist
coalition over a dispute on the candidacy of former Iranian
president Hashemi Rafsanjani to run for the coming parliamentary
polls.
</P>
<P>
"I do not believe that in general there is a dispute" between
the Party of Constructive Executives of Iran (PCEI) and the leftist
May 23 Front, Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance Ataollah
Muhajerani told a group of local reporters.
</P>
<P>
Muhajerani said that individuals from the PCEI or May 23 Front
may bitterly criticize one another, but there is not a dispute in
principle between the two sides, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The May 23 Front is a pro-reform political coalition formed by
political groups and parties that helped the moderate cleric
Mohammad Khatami win the presidential election on May 23, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The PCEI, established with Rafsanjani's assistance during his
second term of presidency (1993-1997), joined the May 23 Front to
support Khatami, but adopted a central-right position in some
important issues.
</P>
<P>
The PCEI has announced to put Rafsanjani on its list of
candidates for the forthcoming parliamentary elections slated on
February 18, but other parties of the front strongly rejected
Rafsanjani's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
The leftist reformist parties and groups considered Rafsanjani's
nomination as a hindrance for Khatami's reform course because of
his close links with the conservatives, particularly his relations
with the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
Muhajerani, a founding member of the PCEI, called on leaders of
the pro-reformist parties to minimize disputes within the coalition
and urged them to stop their debate over Rafsanjani's candidacy
since Rafsanjani has announced to run for the polls as an
independent candidate.
</P>
<P>
He also rejected the suggestion that the split between the PCEI
and the May 23 Front will lead to a reshuffle in Khatami's cabinet
after the coming parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
"I did not know anything about a possible reshuffle in the
future and no discussion had been held in this respect in the
cabinet," he said, adding that he is optimistic about the coalition
continuing its activities.
</P>
<P>
Referring to his ministry's policies, Muhajerani said that he is
responsible to carry out the cultural policies of the government
regardless of whether or not it is acceptable to the PCEI.
</P>
<P>
The minister also denied the rumor on his possible separation
from the PCEI, saying that the party should curb some of out-of-
control moves, "it is a matter different from separation from the
party."

<HEADLINE> Canadian High-Tech Goliath Announces Largest Acquisition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- In a 15 billion U.S. dollars
deal, Canada's JDS Uniphase Corp. is to take over its U.S.-based
rival E-Tek Dynamics Inc.
</P>
<P>
With "the largest acquisition in Canadian high-tech history,"
Canada now has JDS Uniphase and Nortel Networks Corp. as its two
Goliaths in fiber optics, the country's leading Globe and Mail
newspaper said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The combination, announced Monday night but still subject to
regulatory and shareholder approvals, is expected to boost the
capacity of fiber-optic cable, the high-speed sinews of
communications networks.
</P>
<P>
Both companies say that the merger is a strategic move to break
capacity bottlenecks.
</P>
<P>
"We can't meet all the demand from our customers. We're
becoming a bottleneck," E-Tek spokeswoman Alison Reynders was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
JDS Uniphase feels the same crunch, which limits the company's
plan to double the manufacturing capacity every year for the next
couple of years, according to JDS chief executive officer Kevin
Kalkhoven.
</P>
<P>
The combined firm will have a market value of 76 billion U.S.
dollars, with a total workforce of more than 10,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
There won't be layoffs. Instead, and the new powerhouse will
need as many people as possible, the companies have indicated.
</P>
<P>
"These are two companies that are growing very quickly and
hiring very aggressively," said Reynders.
</P>
<P>
E-Tek, with the current workforce of 2,450 employees, produces
components and modules for fiber-optic systems, including
wavelength division multiplexers that increase network capacity.
</P>
<P>
JDS Uniphase, boasting a workforce of 8,200 employees, develops
and manufactures a wide range of fiber-optic products.
</P>
<P>
Under the definitive all-stock agreement for the merger, E-Tek,
based in San Jose, California, is to become a wholly owned
subsidiary of JDS Uniphase, which is based in Nepean, Ontario, and
San Jose.

<HEADLINE> United Nations Not to Abandon Angolan People, Senior Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.N. under-secretary-general, Kieran Prendergast, told an
open Security Council debate on Angola, "The secretary-general has
reiterated that the United Nations will not abandon the people of
Angola and the organization has continued to provide humanitarian,
human rights and development assistance to the country."
</P>
<P>
"He also reiterated the readiness of the United Nations to
support efforts to seek a peaceful settlement of the conflict,"
Prendergast said. "The council is aware that consultations are
continuing with the Angolan government regarding the future United
Nations presence and role in Angola."
</P>
<P>
As amended by the Security Council, the new United Nations
office in Angola will continue to assist the government and civic
organizations in the area of capacity building, humanitarian
assistance and the promotion of human rights.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general is encouraged by the decision of the (
Angolan) Council of Ministers to approve the Status of Mission
Agreement that has now been forwarded to the National Assembly for
endorsement," said the senior official. "He also intends to
appoint the head of the new U.N. office in Angola soon."
</P>
<P>
To give added impetus to the search for a political solution of
the conflict in Angola, the secretary-general recently appointed
the former Nigerian permanent representative to the United Nations,
Ibrahim Gambari, as his special advisor on African issues and
asked him to pay particular attention to Angola.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general looks forward to an early opportunity to
exchange views with the government on the future role of the
United Nations in Angola, a role that would make it possible for
the organization to make a meaningful contribution to the search
of lasting peace in the country and to the security and stability
of the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. military presence in Angola ceased to exist last
February after the collapse of the peace process in the
southwestern African country.
</P>
<P>
At present, "the humanitarian situation is particularly
critical," he said. The war-affected population in Angola is
estimated at almost 4 million, about a third of the country's
population. Almost 2 million people are internally displaced and
both resident populations and internally displaced people show
high level of malnutrition.

<P>
"There is a deplorable lack of progress on the disarmament and
international security issues which the international community
considered the highest priority: the multilateral search for
genuine measures of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferaton, and
prevention of an arms race in outer space," Annan said in the
message read to the conference here Tuesday by Vladimir Petrovsky,
secretary-general of the disarmament conference and personal
representative of the secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
Annan noted that the fact that the conference remained
deadlocked on these issues was part of a wider and disturbing
stagnation in the overall disarmament and non-proliferation agenda.
</P>
<P>
"Towards the end of last year's session, the conference had
come very close to reaching consensus on mechanisms for dealing
with both nuclear disarmament and prevention of an arms race in
outer space," the U.N. chief said, adding that such consensus
would have unlocked the program of work and allowed work to begin
in earnest on a range of issues.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the international community placed great
importance on the work of the disarmament conference, Annan
expressed the hope that the conference this year would continue
its search for compromises in a spirit of flexibility and with a
real sense of urgency and that it would not disappoint
expectations.
</P>
<P>
If the conference made tangible progress on items on its agenda
in the first part of this session, the NPT (Non-Proliferation
Treaty) Review Conference stood a better chance of succeeding,
Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The first part of the disarmament conference's year 2000
session will continue until March 24. The second part will take
place from May 22 to July 7 and the third part from August 7 to
September 22.

<HEADLINE> WHO Launches Commission on Macroeconomics, Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (
WHO) launched here Tuesday an expert commission to clarify the
link between health and poverty reduction.
</P>
<P>
Over a two-year period, the Commission on Macroeconomics and
Health (CMH) will produce a series of studies on how concrete
health interventions can lead to economic growth and reduce
inequity in developing countries, according to a WHO press release.
</P>
<P>
The CMH will recommend a set of measures designed to maximize
the poverty reduction and economic development benefits of health
sector investment.
</P>
<P>
The commission, chaired by Harvard professor Dr Jeffrey Sachs,
consists of 15 of the world leading economists and economic policy
makers, who are representatives from the World Bank, the
International Monetary Fund, the United Nations Development
Program, the Economic Commission on Africa and the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development as well as leading
economic development experts.
</P>
<P>
"The World Bank's 1993 World Development Report showed us how
important health is to development," said WHO Director-General Dr
Gro Harlem Brundtland at the launch.
</P>
<P>
"Since then, issues such as debt relief, trade negotiations,
the AIDS crisis, essential drug availability and the spiraling of
health care costs have left no doubt that health plays a central
role in the world economy," she pointed out.
</P>
<P>
However, she said, few finance officials and development
economists have so far explored the potential importance of health
investment as an instrument for reducing poverty.
</P>
<P>
In the next two years, the CMH will assess critically and
generate further evidence on:
</P>
<P>
- The nature magnitude of the economic outcomes (income and
productivity growth, poverty reduction and social protection) of
investing in health;
</P>
<P>
- The economics of incentives for research and development of
drugs and vaccines that address diseases primarily affecting the
poor;
</P>
<P>
- Effective and equitable mobilization of resources required to
deal with major disease problems of the poor and to develop and
sustain health systems more generally;
</P>
<P>
- Health and international economic relations (such as trade-
related issues);
</P>
<P>
- Development assistance and health (including consideration of
efficiency in use of assistance oriented to improving health,
consequences of adjustment and stabilization policies for health
and the health sector, and debt relief); and
</P>
<P>
- Costs and efficiency in addressing major diseases of the poor.
</P>
<P>
The commission will produce a final report by the end of 2001.

<HEADLINE> UN/ECE: 3-Day Storms in Europe Damage 6-Month Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The storms on December 26-28
last year over Europe felled 165 million cubic meters of timber,
equivalent of six months' harvest, said the United Nations
Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE) here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
France (111 million m3), Germany (27 million m3) and
Switzerland (10 million m3) were the most affected, representing
roughly twice as much as their annual removals. In an earlier
storm on December 11, Denmark and Sweden lost 3.5 million m3 of
timber and 5 million m3 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Countries across Europe sustained damage to their forests which
in terms of volume of wood blown down is the highest in the
continent since the catastrophic storms in 1990 and even worse
than those in value, said the UN/ECE.

<HEADLINE> Italian Tourism Lags Behind Rivals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Italy's tourism industry is losing
ground to its competitors, in part because of failure to open up
the little-visited cultural centers of the south, a study by the
Italian National Research Council warned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, one contribution to help reduce
overcrowding in the main tourist destinations such as Florence,
Rome and Venice would be to attract visitors to parts of the
country currently off the tourists' beaten track.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Italy's vast historical, archaeological
and artistic heritage includes 95,000 tourist-worthy churches, 30,
000 historic stately homes and 3,600 museums.
</P>
<P>
The brute statistics show that, while Italy may have the second
highest earnings from tourism in the world with 60 trillion lire (
over 30 billion U.S. dollars) last year, it was only fourth for
the number of visitors, currently running at about 32 million a
year.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, for both measures, Italy has registered
fairly small gains in 1988-96, while the tourist industry in other
countries went full steam ahead.
</P>
<P>
The number of tourists visiting Italy in the period rose by
only 2.51 percent, while France saw an increase of 4.66 percent.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. showed a similar rise, but also posted a 13 percent
increase in revenue from tourism, compared to Italy's 8.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, apart from rising competition from
eastern Europe and Asia, this was due to the lack of innovation in
Italian tourism coupled with the burden of inefficient public
services and infrastructural shortcomings, which were all
magnified in the poorer south.
</P>
<P>
The report said these problems created difficulties in the way
the research council attempted to develop strategies which could
popularize the country's lesser-known places of interest,
generally in economically weak regions.
</P>
<P>
The study said further measures to ease the influx of tourists
to cities such as Florence, Venice and Rome should include
increasing mid-range accommodation, encouraging visits throughout
the year and not just during specific seasons, and lengthening the
average length of stay in the country as a whole.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Moves to Save Falling Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's central bank Tuesday
injected 10 million U.S. dollars into the foreign exchange market
in an attempt to save the country's depreciating shilling from
falling further.
</P>
<P>
The move has brought the total intervention on the sale over
the last two weeks to 20 million dollars, according to a press
release issued by the management of Bank of Uganda (BOU) Tuesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
BOU would continue to monitor the market developments closely
and would not hesitate to intervene when signs of instability
emerge, the news release said.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate of Ugandan shillings to U.S. dollars fell
from 1505:1 to 1540:1 over the last two weeks, triggering panic
among local depositors and businessmen. It is widely believed
that the shilling depreciation is attributed to the falling down
of the country's coffee export recently.
</P>
<P>
BOU's capacity to intervene in the market on the sale side,
which has remained high since the foreign exchange market was
fully liberalized, was enhanced by recent substantial donor
disbursements including 24 million euros received from the
European Economic Community on December 28, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Angola Vows to Combat Sleeping Sickness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Angola government has vowed
to fight against the troublesome trypanosomes, a sleeping sickness
prevalent in the country, a health official said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Josenando Teofilo, the Angolan government has set
up in the capital city of Luanda a specialized organization, named
the Institute for Combatting and Controlling the Trypanosomes
(ICCT), to fight the disease.
</P>
<P>
In cooperation with French and Norwegian organizations, the
Angolan government has mobilized 1.3 million U.S. dollars for the
construction of the institute and the rehabilitation of a center
of reference and investigation located in Viana, a satellite city
of Luanda.
</P>
<P>
Teofilo expressed his deep apprehension over the epidemic
sickness, saying that on average in the six provinces affected by
the disease, some 7, 000 cases are diagnosed annually.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, there were 7,920 cases of the sleeping sickness
diagnosed in the southwest African country, with the province of
Kwanza-norte hit most, with 2,840 cases registered.
</P>
<P>
However, local experts said this number is far smaller than the
real figure, since the investigation only covered five percent of
the population. It is estimated that if 80 percent of the infected
population go to hospital, the total number of the registered
cases will reach 80,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
Sleeping sickness, which makes the patients prone to sleep in a
harmful way, is a regional disease in the tropical Africa. It is
spread through a kind of fly called tchaitchai.
</P>
<P>
In Angola, the disease is prevalent in the north provinces of
Zaire, Uige, Kwanza-norte, Bengo, Luanda and the central coastal
province of Benguela.

HARARE, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Political Committee for the
 implementation of the Lusaka ceasefire agreement in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) Tuesday appealed here to
African countries for financial and material contributions.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Military Commission (JMC), which is to monitor the
implementation of the agreement and investigate all ceasefire
violations, still suffers serious financial and resource
constraints from both Africa and the international community, the
committee said.
</P>
<P>
At the end of a two-day meeting here, the committee welcomed an
 affirmation by the Maputo summit that the Lusaka agreement, which
was signed on July 10 last year, is an important process of the
peaceful settlement of the DRC conflict.
</P>
<P>
The committee called upon all the parties to continue to
respect the agreement and ensure the prevalence of conditions
necessary for its successful implementation.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the parties noted that some provisions of the
Lusaka agreement had been implemented and recommitted themselves
to implementing the remaining provisions on the basis of the
revised calender.
</P>

The Political Committee comprises foreign ministers and rebel
representatives of the signatories to the Lusaka peace accord on

<P>
MAPUTO, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican parliament, the
Assembly of the Republic, Tuesday elected its new Standing
Commission as the governing board of the assembly.
</P>
<P>
The 15 members of the commission were chosen in proportion to
the strength of the political groups making up the assembly.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Frelimo (Mozambique Liberation Front ) has 133 seats
in the assembly while the sole opposition force, the coalition of
Renamo (Mozambican National Resistance) and Electoral Union, has
117.
</P>
<P>
As a result, eight members of the Standing Commission were
chosen from Frelimo, and seven from Renamo. With this composition,
the Frelimo side of the commission is much more weighted
politically than was the case in the previous legislature.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting of the new commission is scheduled for
Wednesday. It must start preparing the first substantive meeting
of the new assembly, which should begin in February.
</P>
<P>
The commission is also held responsible for approving the state

</P>
<P>
The UAE will participate in the war games, code-named Gulf 2000,
with all its military capability including the armed forces, air

NEW DELHI, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong said here Tuesday that his country is keen on broadening
its relations with India while New Delhi said it welcomes
investments from Singapore in its infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Goh, who arrived here on Monday for a six-day visit, told
reporters that he wanted India to look forward in its relations
with South East Asia, ASEAN and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
"I know India places importance with the United States and
Europe," said Goh after an official welcome ceremony and his
meeting with Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee along with
his cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
He said that relations between the two countries were very good,
but "unfortunately because of the recent economic crisis in Asia,
our contacts were slowed down and I am, therefore, here to
strengthen our ties."
</P>
<P>
The Singapore prime minister told the joint press conference
that he regards India as a country with great potential while
Vajpayee said the potential is great and "we are planning to
exploit it."
</P>
<P>
Goh also met Indian Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha Tuesday

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong and his Malaysian counterpart Mahathir bin Mohammed are
expected to meet after the Chinese New Year to discuss outstanding
bilateral issues between their countries.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman from the Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs
confirmed Tuesday that Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong had said he
hoped to meet Mahathir after the Chinese New Year to discuss
outstanding bilateral issues and Mahathir was reported to have
said that he was agreeable to a meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Spokesman, who did not identify himself, made the
confirmation while commenting on a Mingguan Malaysia report dated
January 16 in which Malaysian Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Syed
Hamid was reported to have said that the CPF (Central Provident
Fund) and CLOB (the Central Limit Order Book) issues were not
included in the package of outstanding bilateral issues discussed
between senior officials of Singapore and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman reaffirmed that "the CPF and CLOB issues are part
of the package of outstanding bilateral issues discussed by senior
officials of both countries."
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, senior officials from the two
countries have conducted three rounds of negotiations respectively
in March, April and May last year and the package under
negotiations also includes the long-term supply of water to
Singapore, the use of Malaysian airspace by the Republic of
Singapore Air Force and the relocation of Malaysia's check point
of immigration and quarantine (CIQ) in Singapore, and Malaysians'
deposit in Singapore's Central Provident Fund when they worked in
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over the CLOB issue has become protruded after
repeated efforts failed to find a solution to the problem.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman underlined that the Singapore side has pointed
out that the CLOB issue should not remain outstanding when the
package was
finally solved.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 4.86 billion U.S. dollars worth of shares held by
Singapore and Malaysia investors have been frozen since 1998 after
Malaysia imposed credit controls and banned trading of its listed
shares aboard.
</P>
<P>
Before the freeze, the Malaysian shares were traded on the over-
the-counter market in Singapore under the Central Limit Order Book
International (CLOB) scheme.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian companies and private individuals have offered to buy
the CLOB securities at a discount to market prices or to help
transfer the shares for a fee.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has said
private-sector offers cannot supersede Malaysia's responsibilities
under a 1998 pact which he said sets out the steps by which CLOB
securities are to be transferred into investor's individual
accounts with the Malaysian Central Depository.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore side has stated that if the CLOB issue was not
resolved,it would take the case to the World Trade Organization
for arbitration.

<HEADLINE> Russia's New Duma Holds First Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The new Russian State Duma or
the lower house of parliament of the third convocation elected in
the polls on December 19, 1999 held its first plenary session
Tuesday, opening its work at an official ceremony of confirmation
of the lower chamber.
</P>
<P>
The house has 441 members, 225 of whom were elected on party
tickets and have already formed factions, such as the Communist
Party, the Unity bloc, the Fatherland-All Russia coalition, the
Union of Right-Wing Forces, the Zhirinovsky bloc and the Yabloko
movement.
</P>
<P>
The rest deputies were elected on the first-past-the-post
principle. The elections were not successful in nine
constituencies, mainly because more voters cast their ballots
against all candidates than for any one candidate. The new polls
have to be held in these constituencies in spring.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the new State Duma, acting Russian President
Vladimir Putin advocated a consolidated and more effective
parliament, urging lawmakers to step up their work on priority
federal laws "without procrastination."
</P>
<P>
"The policy of struggle and political ambitions should be
brought to an end, and a transfer should be made to a policy of
cooperation and self-restriction," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
The new Duma should mark a new stage in the Russian parliament'
s work, said Putin, noting that an example of efficient
cooperation between the executive and legislative branches was set
in the second half of last year.
</P>
<P>
"The new Duma can count on constructive and open cooperation
with the executive branch. As an acting president, I am prepared
to extend comprehensive assistance to parliament," he said. "We do
not intend to split the deputies into ours and someone else's. We
expect broad support in the Duma," he said.
</P>
<P>
In keeping with tradition, the oldest deputy from each faction
and the main groups of deputies will take turns to preside over
the first plenary session of the new Duma. Seventy-nine-year-old
Yegor Ligachev, ex-member of the Central Political Bureau of the
former Soviet Union Communist Party, is the eldest among the lower
house members, chaired Tuesday's plenary session.
</P>
<P>
The session is expected to elect the house's leading bodies on
the opening day. The house will elect its speaker, his deputies
and chairmen of the house committees.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party and the Unity movement are the largest in
the new State Duma, occupying 113 and 95 seats respectively. The
Fatherland-All Russia alliance and the Union of Right-Wing Forces
control a relatively large number of seats and thus votes (46 and
29), while the Yabloko and Zhirinovsky blocs have the least seats
of 20 and 17. In general, the new Duma has 35 female members.
</P>
<P>
In addition, new groups of deputies are emerging in the Duma,
such as the People's Deputy group, the Russian Regions group and
the Agrarian group.

Also in the report to the 15-nation Security Council, the U.N.
chief called on the U.N. Security Council and donor countries to
take concrete steps to promote the peace process in war-torn
Angola, where the worsening humanitarian situation is affecting a
growing number of vulnerable people.
</P>
<P>
Annan said, "I urge the donor community to respond as generous
as possible to the 2000 United Nations Consolidated Inter-agency
Appeal for Angola."
</P>
<P>
"I earnestly hope that the draft Status-of-Mission Agreement
can be concluded without any further delay, so that UNOA (U.N.
Office in Angola) may begin to assume its functions, in accordance
with the Security Council resolution," which was adopted on
October 15, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Following a major military offensive throughout the country in
recent months, the Angolan government has gradually re-established
its authority in areas formerly controlled by the rebel National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), including the
rebels' strongholds in central highlands.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, some measure of stability has been achieved in
several regions" in the southwestern African country, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
However, "the hostilities, which affected several regions of
Angola, have continued to cause immense suffering for the Angolan
people and the destruction of the country's infrastructure," Annan
said. "The recent escalation of fighting into Namibia is also a
major source of concern."
</P>
<P>
"The humanitarian situation, which affects a growing number of
vulnerable people, remains extremely alarming," he said.
</P>
<P>
A 1994 peace deal crumbled when fighting erupted again in
Angola in December 1998. Over the past four months, government
troops have captured several rebel bases and pushed UNITA to the
far south and east.
</P>
<P>
"The government has maintained the position that it does not
consider Mr. Jonas Savimbi (the UNITA leader) a credible partner
for dialogue, given his record of not implementing his previous
undertakings in good faith," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately, only a political solution can help to restore
durable peace and security in Angola," Annan said. "In this spirit,
I welcome the recent indication by the Angolan authorities that
the Lusaka Protocol remains a valid basis for the peace process."
</P>
<P>
"I strongly urge UNITA to demonstrate convincingly that it is
prepared to fulfill its commitments under the Lusaka Protocol,"
signed in July last year, "to seek genuine national reconciliation,
" Annan added.

<HEADLINE> Italian Sailor Shoots Self Dead on Rome's Central Monument </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 18 (Xinhua) -- A young draftee sailor shot
himself dead early Tuesday morning on Rome's Tomb of the Unknown
Soldier in the central Piazza Venezia.
</P>
<P>
Nicola Farfaglia, 23, born in the central Italian city of
Bologna, was a student at Rome University. He had been in the navy
for three months.
</P>
<P>
Investigations are trying to establish whether it was a
voluntary act, but early clues would appear to indicate it was
indeed suicide.
</P>
<P>
The two soldiers who guard the flame on the Tomb -- one on each
side -- are given munitions in a plastic wrapping but told to
unwrap and insert them only if someone breaches the area.
</P>
<P>
Farfaglia reportedly loaded his rifle, put the barrel under his
chin and shot himself through the head, according to an eye
witness.
</P>
<P>
Farfaglia's companion is still in shock because of the incident,
which took place just before three o'clock Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is halfway up the steps of the
Victor Emanuel Monument, a vast neoclassical building in front of
the Roman fora and one of Rome's best-known sights.

<HEADLINE> China Objects to Annan's Nomination of Ekeus As Chief Arms Inspector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- China Tuesday voiced its
opposition to U.N. chief Kofi Annan's nomination of Sweden's
Ambassador to the United States Rolf Ekeus as the chairman of the
new U.N. arms inspection regime for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Ranfeng, the spokesman for the Chinese Mission, said
Chinese Permanent Representative to the United Nations Qin Huasun
had informed the president of the United Nations Security Council,
Richard Holbrooke of the United States, of the Chinese position.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, Ambassador Qin said in the letter,
"I have to point out that my mission is in a difficult position to
go along with the nominee by the secretary-general, due to reasons
we have stressed at the various occasions."
</P>
<P>
"In our view, the focus in choosing the candidature for the
chairmanship should be closely associated with whether or not
Resolution 1284 can be smoothly implemented. I still believe that
candidates from developing countries, who may be better positioned
to convince Iraq to cooperate with the council, should be given
more attention and consideration," Qin said.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador appreciated the tremendous efforts made by the
U.N. chief in securing a suitable candidate for the post.
</P>
<P>
Annan Monday notified the Security Council that he nominated
Ekeus as the executive chairman of the United Nations Monitoring,
Verification and Inspection Commission for Iraq created by a
council resolution adopted on December 17.
</P>
<P>
Russia Tuesday objected to the nomination hours after Annan's
nomination.

<P>
BRUSSELS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
Tuesday it has decided to open consultations with Cote d'Ivoire
under Article 366a of the Lome Convention on repayment of missing
money.
</P>
<P>
The 15-country EU said in a statement that it decided by

concerned to consultations "with a view to assessing the situation
in detail, if necessary, remedying it".

after launching a military coup and became new military leader of
Cote d'Ivoire, has expressed his rejection to repay millions of
dollars of missing EU money the former government had promised to
reimburse.

<P>
Since the December 24 coup, the European bloc has urged all
parties to restore peacefully and rapidly democratic
constitutional rule in the African country.
</P>
<P>
Under certain procedures of the EU, the incoming talks should
be opened within 15 days after the decision.

TEHRAN, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Tuesday rejected the
Israeli accusation that it was involved in a recent explosion in
Israel and set up obstacles in the way of the Middle East peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi on Tuesday
termed as "ridiculous" the remarks of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak broadcast by Radio Israel on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Barak vowed to crack down terrorist activities aimed at
undermining the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks soon after at least
20 people were injured in a pipe-bomb explosion in downtown Hadera,
north of Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Such claims have been repeatedly made by the Israeli officials
in order to divert public opinion from the Palestinians' legitimate
rights, the Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Asefi as saying.
</P>
<P>
Iran believes that restoration of all legitimate rights of the
Palestinian nation is the only way for establishment of peace and
stability in the region, he added.

JAKARTA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Britain wants to strengthen its

BANGKOK, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet decided Tuesday
to ask Malaysia to give up tariff and non-tariff privileges from
Thailand for its palm oil products under the ASEAN Free Trade Area
Agreement (AFTA)if it does not open its automobile market.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release of the Government House, Thailand
will discuss this issue in bilateral talks with Malaysia,
especially at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
ministerial meeting, to be held in Myanmar in May.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has in the past threatened to withdraw palm oil from
the AFTA inclusion list if Malaysia continued to exclude vehicles
and spare parts from the list. But it eventually backed down and
agreed to conform to the initial ASEAN agreement on AFTA.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's decision to keep palm oil products on the inclusion
list means the country will have to reduce import tariffs on those
products by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
On January 1, 2000, six of the 10-members in ASEAN began to
reduce tariffs for 15 product categories to zero to five percent.
These items are on what is known as the fast-track list. For
Thailand, the 15 categories cover 7,737 product items.
</P>
<P>
The 7,737 items constitute 85 percent of the total number of
products for which Thailand has pledged to reduce tariffs by 2003.

LUSAKA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- About 15 rebels of the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) attacked a
border village in Zambia's North Western province on Monday,
shooting one man and abducting two girls aged nine and 10.
</P>
<P>
North Western province Permanent Secretary Maybin Mubanga told
Zambia News Agency (ZANA) Tuesday that the rebels attacked
Nyambingile village in Chavuma in the morning where a man was shot
and is currently in the Solwezi hospital of the province.
</P>
<P>
According to Senior Assistant Police Commanding Officer of the
province Hudson Beezu, the rebels also attacked chief
Nyambingile's palace, where they stole two million kwachas (about
800 U.S. dollars), four bicycles, four mattresses and food.
</P>
<P>
The rebels were heavily armed and Zambian officers have been
deployed in the area to enhance security, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the whereabouts of the two girls is still
unknown and every thing possible is being done to rescue them.
</P>
<P>
Some UNITA rebels are reported to have fled into the province
after being defeated by the Angolan government forces.
</P>
<P>
20,000 Angolan refugees have fled to Zambia since the beginning
of this year, some of them are rebels.
</P>
<P>

centers in Mwinilunga and Solwezi in the province to screen
refugees properly before transferring them to refugee camps.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Defense Minister Kundi
Paihama has announced that the Angolan and Spanish governments
will set up military cooperation in the near future, the official
newspaper Jornal de Angola reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement after a meeting with Carlos Bastarreche
Sagues, visiting Secretary-general of the Spanish Foreign Ministry
responsible for external policy of the Spanish government.
</P>
<P>
The two governments are currently studying the form of the
future cooperation, Paihama said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Angolan minister, the Spanish-Angolan
relations are " excellent". Spain has helped the Angolan Internal
Ministry and Fishery Ministry cultivate cadres, he said.
</P>
<P>
Paihama also said that he had been invited by his Spanish
counterpart to pay a visit to the Iberian country this year.
</P>
<P>
In his turn, Sagues said the victory obtained by the Angolan
government troops in the central and east highland will permit the
overall control by the government of the frontiers of the
southwest African country.
</P>
<P>
This has created optimism not only among the Angolans but also
among the countries having investment in Angola, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Spain will possibly provide the Angolan government
troops with defense materials, vehicles by air or by land, and
other equipment.
</P>
<P>
According to Sagues, the Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria
Aznar is scheduled to pay an official visit to Angola in 2001.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The mobile phone, a luxury here
several years ago, is now a common sight in Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
Surveys in 14 cities by marketing agencies, such as the Beijing-
based Mainland Marketing Research Company, show that about 87.7
percent of the households had standard telephones by the end of
1999, and 34.8 percent had cell phones.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the surveys in these cities, including Beijing,
Harbin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Xi'an, and Lanzhou, also suggests
that the Internet is becoming more popular, used by 6.5 percent of
the families; and 3.9 percent of the families have their own fax
machines as compared with 0.2 percent three years ago.
</P>
<P>
China's telecom market looks promising this year, with another
6.9 percent of the households planning to get Internet service,
and 12.5 percent saying they are very likely to buy mobile phones.

<HEADLINE> More Chinese Buying Their Own Apartments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A recent survey shows that by the end of last year, about 72
percent of Chinese urban residents in a total of 14 large cities
had bought their own homes. Given the remarkable growth of home-
buying last year, this year's market prospects for commercial
apartments looks rosy.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Mainland Marketing Research Company together with
another 13 survey firms across China polled urban residents in 14
Chinese cities at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Among some 6,400 citizens, nearly 40 percent have bought
residential buildings. Some 28 percent of the respondents were
still living in rented housing, but the rate had largely decreased
from the year before.
</P>
<P>
About 17.5 percent of the home-buyers bought apartments in 1999,
up five percent over the early official estimate. Statistics show
that more than half of these people bought their apartments
assigned by their work units, while 37.5 percent of households
chose commercial buildings.
</P>
<P>
Commercial buildings with less than three bedrooms plus a
living room were the bestsellers in last year's real estate market,
the nationwide survey noted. Some 35.2 percent of urban residents
purchased these apartments.
</P>
<P>
When asked if they want to buy housing in the year 2000, 17.5
percent of the interviewees said yes and 74 percent answered no.
</P>
<P>
About 57.8 percent of those who said they planned to buy
apartments this year said they would look first at the commercial
apartments. This rate was 23.3 percent higher than that of last
year.
</P>
<P>
Based on this figure, it is estimated that Chinese will buy at
least a total 1.3 million apartments.

Although the international civilian airplane market is mainly

developing its own civilian aircraft, especially regional planes
having a good market prospect in the next two decades, said Liu.

<HEADLINE> China to Strengthen Patent System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- China has vowed to strengthen
its patent system and intellectual property protection while at
the same time setting into motion a comprehensive patent
information network.
</P>
<P>
"China will better its patent mechanism and make it play an
active role in economic development," Jiang Ying, administrator of
the State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO), said today at the
national patent conference.
</P>
<P>
She urged the pilot cities to speed up their applications for
modern patent management, which would meet world standards.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she said, state-owned enterprises and academic
institutions should pay more attention to patent application and
protection.
</P>
<P>
As the top official overseeing China's intellectual property
protection, Jiang said her office is considering drawing up
regulations on a high-tech patent protection and awarding system
for patent owners.
</P>
<P>
"The state will encourage the Chinese people to make more
inventions," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
While further cultivating the market of patented technologies,
China is establishing a nationwide patent information network,
which might be finished by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also stressed that standardized service in the field is
urgently needed in China.
</P>
<P>
In the second revision of the patent law, the administration
wants to streamline procedures for patent application.
</P>
<P>
Since the adoption of the patent law in 1985, China has
received more than one million patent applications.
</P>
<P>
China has adopted several related regulations in addition to
the patent law.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China has over 5,000 patent agents and 560
patent agencies, including 15 dealing in foreign transactions.
</P>
<P>
Originating from the China Patent Office (CPO), the SIPO takes
more responsibility for coordinating with foreign counterparts and
international organizations.

<HEADLINE> EU Vows Support for Middle East Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 18 (Xinhua) -- A European Union (EU) delegation
said here Tuesday that the EU would extend all support for the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama, whose
country holds the EU rotating presidency, stressed that the EU's
role in the peace process was not that of a negotiator but of a
facilitator.
</P>
<P>
Gama, who arrived here Tuesday with the EU Foreign and Secretary
Policy Javier Solana and EU Middle East envoy Miguel Moratinos,
expressed the 15-nation bloc's concerns over the delays in the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel announced Sunday it would postpone the handover, set for
Thursday, of 6.1 percent of the West Bank to Palestinian rule
stipulated in a September interim accord.
</P>
<P>
And the Syrian-Israeli talks, which were to resume in the United
States on January 19, have been put off indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
Gama said the EU was working through diplomacy, communications,
and exchanging opinions with concerned parties to help overcome the
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hopes that the parties involved in the process
could surpass their disagreements soon.
</P>
<P>
The EU delegation was in Cairo on the last leg of a three-day
regional tour which also included Syria, Jordan, Israel and the
Palestinian self-rule territories.
</P>
<P>
Gama said in Damascus Monday that the EU would offer security
and economic support to Syria after it seals a peace agreement with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the EU and Egypt had reached a long-awaited
cooperation agreement, but did not say when the pact would be
signed.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh needs 3.435 billion

</P>
<P>
The government has declared the textile as a thrust sector to
attract local and foreign investment to meet the yearly deficit of
2.79 billion meters, he said.
</P>
<P>
To attract local and foreign investment in the sector, the
government has given monetary and fiscal incentives, such as tax
breaks for 5-7 years, continuous tax and duty adjustments, non-
resident Bangladeshis being given equal facilities with foreign
investors, and facilities to export and export-friendly backward
linkage industries, he said.
</P>
<P>
There are 152 cotton spinning mills, of which 143 are in the
private sector, 130 weaving mills and 620 knitting and hosiery
mills in the country, according to the state minister.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Ready to Reopen Relations with Iran: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of
Afghanistan's ruling Taliban militia said Tuesday the regime is
ready to reopen diplomatic relations with Iran, sources from Kabul
said.
</P>
<P>
"Our relations are very good. Our ties have improved 90 percent,
" Taliban's Information Minister Qudratullah Jamal told reporters
in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
"They can reopen their embassy in Kabul according to diplomatic
principles," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Iran closed its embassy in Kabul after nine Iranian diplomats
and one Iranian journalist were killed in Mazar-e-Sharif in August,
1998, when the Taliban militia seized the northern Afghan city.
</P>
<P>
The minister said he believed Tehran is convinced of the non-
interference policy of the Afghan Islamic militia, which controls
most of the country.
</P>
<P>
"We never intend to interfere in others' relations. Nor do we
expect others to do so. Now Iran has understood that the Islamic
Emirate (of Afghanistan) is firm on its word," he said.
</P>
<P>
A team from the Iranian foreign ministry is due to visit
Afghanistan, an Iranian radio said Sunday. The team will inspect
Iranian diplomatic missions in Kabul and other Afghan major cities.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Phase out Leaded Gas in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and 21
oil companies signed Tuesday an agreement that calls for the
complete phaseout of leaded gasoline sales in all service stations
in the Philippine capital of Manila in April this year.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of the Department of Energy (DOE) Mario Tiaoqui said
that Manila's complete shift to unleaded gasoline is nine months
ahead of the national mandatory phaseout of leaded gasoline by
January 2001 under the Philippine Clean Air Act of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Tiaoqui said the early phaseout of leaded gasoline will go a
long way in minimizing air pollution in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
According to Tiaoqui, unleaded gasoline was first launched in
the Philippines in February 1994 and it accounts for nearly 45
percent of total gasoline sales by now.
</P>
<P>
Tiaoqui noted that more and more countries all over the world
are phasing out leaded gasoline in favor of unleaded gasoline due
to health risk.
</P>
<P>
He cited some studies indicating that leaded gasoline increases
the risk of learning disabilities among children and causes
increased blood pressure among adult.

MANILA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of the
Philippines junked Tuesday the Philippine Justice Department's
petition for the extradition of former Presidential Adviser on
Latin American Affairs Mark Jimenez to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Voting 9-6, the Supreme Court also ordered the Department of
Justice to furnish Jimenez copies of the extradition request by

</P>
<P>
In a 41-page decision, the high tribunal said Mark Jimenez shall

comments with supporting evidence.
</P>
<P>
The court has instructed the Department of Foreign Affairs to
inform the U.S. authorities of its ruling.
</P>
<P>
The United States has sought the extradition of Jimenez to face
trial in the United States for alleged tax evasion, fraud and
illegal contributions to the campaign kitty of President Clinton

The Department of Justice believed the Supreme Court has

<HEADLINE> At Least Four Killed in Clan Fighting in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 18 (Xinhua) -- At least four people were
killed and nearly ten others wounded when rival militiamen
exchanged heavy gunfire near the busy Bar Ubah junction of South
Mogadishu, Somalia on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The deceased include a gunmen and three non-combat civilians,
including a lady, caught in the middle of the crossfire.
</P>
<P>
According to eye witnesses, the wild shooting began after a
battle wagon belonging to faction leader Mohamed Qanyareh Afrah
was attacked by gunmen of an oxen exporting business group from
the Suleman subclan of Habar Gidir.
</P>
<P>
The militiamen of Gidir, who were based near the junction,
managed to seize the battle wagon mounted with an anti-tank B-10
gun in the attack. But the militiamen of Afrah, trying to retain
their lost battle wagon, returned with two more battle wagons
aboard with nearly 30 heavily armed fighters as reinforcement.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the armed confrontation roots back to a conflict
over cattle wrestling exceeding 92 oxen by militiamen loyal to
Qanyareh around the industrial street of South Mogadishu two days
ago. A man was killed and another wounded during the incident, but
the dispute was settled Monday after the cattle was returned back
to their owners.
</P>
<P>
However, angry militiamen from the cattle owners, in revenge,
seize the opportunity to re-provoke the fighting when a battle
wagon of Qanyareh was passing by their office close to Bar Ubah
junction.
</P>
<P>
There is no word as yet from either of the warring sides, but
the shooting has subsided a little after mid day with the seized
battle wagon still missing.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Islamic courts of South Mogadishu
Tuesday fully took control of the main child and maternity
hospital of Mogadishu run by the SOS-Kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
Infantry Islamic militiamen supported by battle wagons from the
Islamic courts are now guarding the hospital after its operations
were halted Monday night for nearly eight hours by militiamen
loyal to a former hospital guard who was allegedly fired by the
administration of the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Ali Dahir, one of the guards also responsible of the electric
generator of the hospital, got the fire for failing to fulfil his
duties, according to sources close to the administration.
</P>
<P>
But Dahir refused to accept the decision and switched off the
electric generator of the hospital. He also collected militiamen
of his subclan and ordered the patients to get out of the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
Angry people, mainly women and children, went on demonstration
right in front of the hospital and its surrounding, something that
attracted the Islamic Courts to intervene.
</P>
<P>
The hospital is now operating normally while the case between
the administration and Dahir would be heard later Tuesday,
according to Ibrahim Shawey, one of the Islamic Courts supreme
committee member.

<HEADLINE> Japan Gathering to Deny Nanjing Massacre Arouses Protests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese students in this
capital of east China's Jiangsu Province have protested against
the Japanese right-wing's planned rally in Osaka on January 23 to
deny the occurrence of the 1937 Nanjing Massacre.
</P>
<P>
According to local media, thousands of students from middle
schools, colleges and universities in the city have signed their
names on banners and streamers denouncing the Osaka rally which is
aimed at whitewashing wartime crimes committed by the Japanese
troops.
</P>
<P>
They said that the gathering is a blatant denial of the truth
of the massacre, in which about 300,000 Chinese were slaughtered
by Japanese aggressors.
</P>
<P>
People in China and the world should not tolerate the group's
intentional distortion of historical fact, they argued.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Anguang, a graduate of the History Department of Nanjing
University, said that Chinese and overseas experts including
Japanese historians have an abundance of evidence to prove the
atrocities took place.
</P>
<P>
Zheng said that students should study harder to contribute to
the development of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Many other history professors from Nanjing University noted
that Japanese right-wingers have continued to deny that the
massacre ever happened, and have concocted a series of incidents
to tamper with historical facts.
</P>
<P>
Such lies will be never accepted by either Chinese or the
Japanese peace activists, they noted.
</P>
<P>
During the Nanjing Massacre, thousands of displaced residents
in the city were killed on the campuses of Nanjing University and
Nanjing Normal University, known as international safety zones
during the Nanjing Massacre, according to the historians.
</P>
<P>
All those survived in the zones are witnesses to the massacre,
the historians pointed out.

<HEADLINE> China's Top Legislator Meets Lithuanian Guests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
Chinese National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, told
Arvydas Vidziunas, vice-chairman of Lithuania's Parliament, that
the NPC is willing to enhance exchanges and cooperation with
Lithuania and other countries along the Baltic Sea.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in his meeting with Vidziunas here today.
</P>
<P>
"China is ready to carry out exchanges at various levels so as
to enhance friendship and cooperation," he said, adding that such
contacts can bring the relationship between China and these
countries to a new level.
</P>
<P>
Li told the guests that Sino-Lithuanian ties have developed
smoothly since the two countries forged diplomatic ties in 1991. "
China is ready to develop friendly cooperation with Lithuania on
the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence so that
the China-Lithuania relationship can see greater growth in the new
century," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li also briefed the guests China's situation, in particular
China's strategies for properly handling the relationship between
reform, development and stability.
</P>
<P>
Vidziunas stressed that the growth of relations with China, a
country which plays a major role on the world stage, constituted
an important part of Lithuania's foreign policy. Lithuania is a
young country and thus pays attention to the actions of other
countries, including China, so as to learn from them. He also told
Li that there was substantial progress in the exchanges between
the parliaments of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Vidziunas also conveyed regards from Lithuanian Parliament

Lithuania on Landsbergis's behalf. Li accepted the invitation with
pleasure.

that China is willing to actively develop a friendly and
cooperative relationship with island countries in the South

Even though China and Tonga are geographically distant, Li said,
both are located in the Asia-Pacific region and their bilateral
ties have grown smoothly. He said he hoped Veikuna's visit will
boost the existing friendship and cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China has always deemed that all countries, big or

international community. State-to-state relationships should be
built on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence,
he said.
</P>
<P>

develop friendly cooperative ties with Tonga's Legislative
Assembly. Zhou Guangzhao, vice-chairman of NPC Standing Committee,
is to pay a visit to Tonga next month. Li said he believed Veikune
's current visit and Zhou's February tour can push forward the
bilateral ties. He also expressed appreciation for Tonga's stance
on the Taiwan issue.
</P>

and said he hoped his visit will enhance mutual understanding and
the friendship between the peoples of the two countries. He also

United Nations and China's assistance to his country.

<HEADLINE> Blizzard Hits Inner Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Two months of heavy snow has
affected about 70 percent of the herdsman and domestic animals in
the northern pastures of north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region, according to the local government.
</P>
<P>
In northern Inner Mongolia's Hulun Buir League (Prefecture),
about 6,800 households plus 1.65 million domestic animals are
battling blizzard-related problems stemming from low temperatures,
road closure and shortage of animal feed, said an official with
the league's disaster-relief office.
</P>
<P>
Local governments have allocated about four million yuan in
relief funds and 7,800 tons of feed to the snow-hit areas, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Ongoing bad weather will worsen the already dangerous situation,
the local meteorological department warned.
</P>
<P>
The blizzard which has swept across about 17.3 million hectares
of pasture in Inner Mongolia is described as the worst in four
decades. Heavy snow has killed 36,000 animals and affected 900,000
people, causing an economic loss of nearly 40 million yuan (about
3.6 million U.S. dollars).

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Hutchison Whampoa Limited,
the biggest mobile phone company in Hong Kong, has signed an
agreement with Computer and Technologies Holdings Limited (C&AMP;T) to
buy 17 percent of C&AMP;T's total issued share capital, Hutchison's
Group Managing Director Canning Fok announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, C&AMP;T will issue to Hutchison a two-year
convertible bond in the principal sum of about 230 million HK
dollars (29.4 million U.S. dollars) at an initial conversion price
of 7.9 HK dollars (1.01 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In addition, C&AMP;T will grant to Hutchison an option to subscribe
for shares in C&AMP;T of up to 7.5 percent of its current issued share
capital at option price of 7.9 HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
If both rights are exercised, Hutchison will ultimately hold
approximately 17 percent of the enlarged issued share capital of C&AMP;
T, Fok said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will enable Hutchison to leverage the technical
expertise and resources of C&AMP;T for the growing internal electronic
commerce requirements of the Group's business divisions, Fok said.
</P>
<P>
It will also enable C&AMP;T to accelerate its development in the e-
commerce consulting services as well as the electronic procurement
portal business.
</P>
<P>
Hutchison is a Hong Kong-based conglomerate with origins back
to the 1800s with a market capitalization of 53 billion HK dollars
(6.79 billion U.S. dollars), while C&AMP;T, founded in 1991, is a new
business on a vision to deliver competitive advantage for
enterprises to progress by optimizing their information systems

<HEADLINE> Israel Should Execute Pullout in Time: PNA Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Israel should not delay the third
phase of troop withdrawal from the West Bank beyond January 20 as
set in Sharm el Sheikh memorandum, said a senior Palestinian
official on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State of Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
Affairs Ziad Abu-Zayad told Israel Radio this morning that he still
insisted on the demand that Israel should hand over Jerusalem-
adjacent towns of Abu-Dis and al-Ram to the PNA.
</P>
<P>
The two areas are categorized as Area "B", which means they
should be reverted to the PNA civilian control while Israel will be
responsible for security, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He warned Israeli forces would pay less attention to the public
order in the areas, and said Palestinian police should be allowed
there to keep law and order, and prevent illegal building.
</P>
<P>
On a framework agreement between both sides, the Palestinian
official said Israeli Premier Ehud Barak insisted on mid-February
as the date to conclude this file, but the date could be changed
upon bilateral consensus.
</P>
<P>
PNA leader Yasser Arafat held an unscheduled meeting with Barak
in Tel Aviv Monday night at the premier's request. They discussed
issues related to Israel's decision to delay the third phase
redeployment of 6.1 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also talked about the date of concluding the
framework agreement of the final status talks. But Palestinian
official said they still committed to February 13 as the deadline
for completing the work.
</P>
<P>
The final status talks between Israel and the Palestinians
started September 13 on thorny issues such as Palestinian refugees,
Jerusalem, water, Jewish settlements and Palestinian statehood.
Little progress has been made so far.

<HEADLINE> Despite Arafat-Barak Meeting, Gap still Large: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Israel and the Palestinian remained
far apart from each other as to when a framework agreement between
them should be signed, a senior Palestinian official said.
</P>
<P>
Their gap on the date was still large despite a meeting between
Palestinian Leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Premier Ehud Barak,
Arafat's Advisor Nabil Abu-Redina told Radio Palestine Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
The unscheduled Arafat-Barak meeting Monday night focused on the
Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations in a bid to push the peace
process forward.
</P>
<P>
Israeli sources disclosed that in the meeting which was attended
by senior aides from both sides, Barak asked Arafat to put off the
pre-set date for signing the final status framework agreement but
the Palestinian leader had not given an official reply yet.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders agreed on speeding up the talks to reach an
early consensus on the date of signing the framework agreement
stipulated in Sharm el Sheikh Memorandum, Abu-Redina said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the gap was still large between the two sides.
He said that Arafat would ask U.S President Bill Clinton to
immediately step in during their meeting in Washington on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Israel's commitment to bilateral agreement's time frame would
promote trust in and step up the peace process, Abu-Redina added.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Barak agreed to resume their encounters after
Arafat's U.S trip, he added.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian and Israeli teams have been engaged in the final
status negotiations since last November on thorny issues including
Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, water, Jewish settlements and
Palestinian statehood. No major progress has been achieved.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Economic Recovery for Real: Institute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The recovery of the
Malaysian economy is for real with the gross domestic product (GDP)
having the potential to achieve up to a 6.5-percent growth in the
year 2000, according to the Malaysian Institute of Economic
Research (MIER) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The institute however put the country's real GDP growth
forecast at 6 percent for 2000.
</P>
<P>
"The 6 percent is below its potential level. It is dangerous
for Malaysia to go beyond the potential (6.5 percent) level as the
economy will overheat," the institute's Executive Director Mohamed
Ariff Abdul Kareem said in his presentation on the Malaysian
economic outlook at an MIER National Economic Outlook 2000
conference here.
</P>
<P>
He said that as for Malaysia's recovery, it was real as it was
driven by strong exports, a fiscal stimulus and the fact that it
was more broad-based.
</P>
<P>
The growth would be driven by the recovery in private
investment, consumption and sustained external demand, he said,
adding that low interest rates, the ongoing debt restructuring
exercise and the recovery in domestic demand, supported by a
healthy banking system, would all contribute to the recovery of
the private sector.
</P>
<P>
After a deep contraction of 7.5 percent in 1998, the institute
estimated, GDP growth for 1999 would be 4.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
This is an upward revision from last quarter's forecast in view
of the average expansion of 3.6 percent recorded in the first
three quarters of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The outlook for 2000 appeared to be bright as the external
demand, especially for electronics, was expected to be maintained,
the institute said.
</P>
<P>
The recovering Asian region would support Malaysia's recovery
as more than 50 percent of Malaysia's exports go to the region
itself, according to the institute.
</P>
<P>
The impact of the expansionary policy would continue to be felt
in 2000 with low interest rates expected to remain for now in view
of the subdued inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
The institute projected private consumption to accelerate to 8.
1 percent this year from 2.9 percent last year based on the
expectations of rising income, wealth effects, a higher confidence
level as well as the continued impact of low interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The gross fixed capital would rebound strongly with an 8.5-
percent growth this year with private investment surging 9.9
percent on account of the economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Public investment was projected to slow down to 7 percent as
the government's counter-cyclical spending became less necessary.
</P>
<P>
With the demand for electronics anticipated to improve further,
real exports would continue to be buoyant, with growth projected
at 14 percent in 2000 while imports would pick up by 16.6 percent
as aggregate demand gained further momentum.
</P>
<P>
The inflation was expected to edge up to 3.4 percent this year
as aggregate demand built up as against 2.8 percent estimated for
1999 but unemployment rate would moderate to 3.5 percent from 3.7
percent in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Indian Port, Dock Workers Strike for Higher Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Operations at all 11 major
ports across India came to a standstill Tuesday as the country's
port and dock workers launched an indefinite strike to press for
higher wages and better service conditions.
</P>
<P>
According to the All India Port &AMP; Dock Workers' Federation, the
strike began at midnight Monday after the Surface Transport
Ministry rejected the workers' demand for a wage revision in talks
with the federation.
</P>
<P>
At Mumbai and Nhava Sheva ports alone, the number of workers on
strike reached nearly 45,000 while all loading and unloading
operations at these two ports have stopped, the Press Trust of
India (PTI) reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A Mumbai Port Trust spokeswoman told the PTI that the port has
sought the assistance of the Indian coast guards and home guards
to unload two oil tankers berthed at the oil terminal.
</P>
<P>
Other goods would be unloaded with the help of cargo shipment
agents, said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
In another report the PTI said navy personnel were deployed
Tuesday at the port of Calcutta and the Haldia Dock system to
maintain essential maritime operations on the first day of the
strike.
</P>
<P>
Eight ships were berthed at the Calcutta Port while 11 others
were waiting for loading and unloading service at Haldia, the PTI
quoted port sources as saying.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The search and rescue teams
Tuesday morning discovered the wreckage of a Greek Air Force
fighter jet that went missing while on a training flight Monday.
</P>
<P>
The wreckage was spotted in the Aghiou Georgiou, Xerovouni area
southeast of Mountain Parnassos, central Greece after a massive
land, sea and air search Tuesday morning, the semi-official Athens
News Agency (ANA) quoted Defense Ministry sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The F-4 fighter jet, with two pilots on board, disappeared from
the radar screen Monday morning during a flight between Andravida
air base in the Peleponnessos peninsula and the Aegean island of
Skyros.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Greek Air Force believed that the jet, which
was forced to take off at a low altitude due to the adverse
weather conditions, might crash into a mountain area.
</P>
<P>
It is the first jet crash accident for the Greek Air Force this
year, but the air force has lost more than 73 planes and 43 pilots
in training accidents since January 1987.

<HEADLINE> Nanjing Massacre Cannot Be Denied, Says Foreign Ministry Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Nanjing Massacre was a
wartime atrocity committed by the Japanese troops on the Chinese
people. It is an irrefutable and widely known atrocity that cannot
be denied, said Zhu Bangzao, a Foreign Ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions at a press conference this afternoon, Zhu
said that "we are highly concerned about an anti-China rally to be
held by Japan's right-wing forces at the International Peace
Center in Osaka which aims to deny the Nanjing Massacre. We have
made solemn representations repeatedly to the Japanese side
through diplomatic channels."
</P>
<P>
"Japan's right-wing forces are deliberately tampering with
historical facts, whitewashing wartime crimes and hurting the
feelings of Chinese people and undermining Sino-Japanese friendly
relations in the process," Zhu said, adding that the Chinese
government and all Chinese people, including those who lost family
and loved ones during the atrocity, show strong indignation at it.
</P>
<P>
Historical issues are related with the political basis of the
relations between China and Japan, Zhu said. In the Sino-Japanese
joint statement and other documents, the Japanese government
clearly admits Japan's invasion of China in the history and
expresses its deep introspection.
</P>
<P>
"We pay more attention to Japan's actions than its words," Zhu
said. "We hope that the Japanese government highly understand the
seriousness and harm of the situation and take immediate and
effective measures to prevent further development of the situation,
so as to effectively safeguard the overall interest of the hard-
won bilateral relations."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Justice today
certified 42 Hong Kong lawyers as public notaries, authorizing
them to act as agents for legal affairs in inland areas for HK
residents and firms.
</P>
<P>
They are the first group of HK lawyers appointed as public
notaries by the Chinese government after HK's return in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The public notary system has served as an important bridge
between inland areas and Hong Kong, which have different legal
systems, Vice-Premier Qian Qichen told the new notaries today in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed more professionals would participate in the
system because the demand for handling legal cases involving HK
residents and firms would increase dramatically due to the boom in
HK-inland exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Justice introduced the notary system in 1981. A
total of 251 HK lawyers appointed to the positions have handled
more than 500,000 inland legal cases involving HK residents and
businesses, according to the Justice Minister Gao Changli.
</P>
<P>
Studying inland laws and learning to speak Putonghua, the
standard Chinese pronunciation which is different from the
Guangdong dialect spoken in HK, have become trendy among local
lawyers, according to a HK lawyer attending today's ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Cut Edible Oil Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is expected to save
500 million U.S. dollars during the current fiscal year owing to a
slash in its edible oil imports.
</P>
<P>
Chief of Pakistan Oilseed Development Board Ghulam Farid told
the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan that an amount of 250
million dollars had already been saved in the first half of the
fiscal as the import bill of edible oil has been trimmed from 452
million dollars in July-December 1998 to 218 million dollars
during July-December 1999.
</P>
<P>
A cut in the import bill of edible oil by 250 million dollars
is a record saving which will double by the end of the current
financial year and this will help strengthen the country's balance
of payment position, he added.
</P>
<P>
The government is taking pragmatic steps to boost the
production of canola, sunflower and soybeans which would
ultimately reduce the import bill of edible oil in a significant
way.
</P>
<P>
New policy measures will ensure a reasonable price for the
edible oil produced locally of between 1,400 and 1,500 rupees (26.
4-28.3 dollars) per 40 kilograms so that growers could fetch a
good price for their product.
</P>
<P>
During 1998-99, 1.3 million tons of edible oil was imported for
713 million dollars in Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Revenue Income Below Target in Last Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Tax collected by the Revenue
Department of the Thai Finance Ministry between October and
December last year was 9 percent below the target, Secretary
General Patana Peehuijitra of the department confirmed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The total tax collected in the period, also the first quarter
of the 2000 fiscal year, amounted to 90.6 billion baht (2.4
billion U.S.dollars), 15 percent lower than the same period of the
previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
However, the department was confident that the shortfall would
be made up in the second and third quarters, boosted by receipts
from tourism.
</P>
<P>
Many tourists had postponed trips to Thailand in the last
quarter of 1999 because of worries about the computer's Y2K
problem.
</P>
<P>
Patana attributed the shortfall in revenue to a sharper-than-
expected fall in the interest rate, the tax exemption for the
first 50,000 baht (1,351 dollars) of personal income and the
reduction of value-added tax (VAT) from 10 percent to 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry expected the passbook-savings rate would
remain at the level of about 7 percent during the period, but it
turned out to be only 3 percent by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government levies 15 percent tax on interest income.
</P>
<P>
The tax exemption for the first 50,000 baht of personal income
cost the government 2.6 billion baht (70.2 million dollars) during
the period, Patana said.

The temporary VAT reduction until April 2000 resulted in
additional losses in revenue of about 13.2 billion baht (356.7
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
It was reported by the local media that the official target for
the 2000 fiscal year of 480.8 billion baht (12.9 billion dollars)
was unlikely to be achieved, with actual returns likely to fall
short by 60 billion to 70 billion baht (1.6 billion to 1.9 billion
dollars).

at 2,319.77 points.
</P>
<P>
Total volume decreased to 285.92 million shares worth 607.68

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Ethnic Chinese Permitted to Publicly Mark New Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid has signed a presidential instruction allowing
ethnic Chinese in the country to publicly celebrate the Chinese
New Year, an official said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Please ethnic Chinese across the country celebrate (their
religious day), (they) need not permission again. But (they are)
urged to keep maintaining tolerance (of religion) and safeguard
the national unity (of Indonesia)," Head of Public Service of the
Ministry of Home Affairs Herman Ibrahim said.
</P>
<P>
The presidential decree, signed by Wahid on January 17,
stipulated that the ethnic Chinese need not ask for permission in
advance to celebrate their new year.
</P>
<P>
The president has also decided to scrap a presidential
instruction that restricted ethnic Chinese ritual activities.
</P>
<P>
"The decree now has been revoked," Ibrahim said.
</P>
<P>
Based on Presidential Instruction No.14/1967 issued by former
President Soeharto, all public activities related to Chinese
religious practices and traditions were prohibited and they might
be held only at home.
</P>
<P>
President Wahid has pledged that his government would revoke
all laws which were ethnically or religiously discriminative.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for Political and Security Affairs Gen.
Wiranto has pledged recently to review all discriminative laws,
regulations and native policies against the ethnic Chinese in the
country.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Majority of the enterprises
sold by the Ugandan government are now owned by Ugandans, New
Vision daily quoted a senior government official as saying on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
State Minister for Privatization Manzi Tumubweine said that 70
percent of the 64 former state-run enterprises are now in the
hands of Ugandans, 10 percent are joint ventures and 20 percent
owned by foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The privatization process gained momentum in 1995 and 1996. But
it slowed down recently because of rampant corruption involving
senior government officials.
</P>
<P>
However, the Ugandan government said that it will continue the
privatization process and sell most of the state-owned
enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Djibouti President's Peace Proposal on Somali Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Djibouti President Ismael
Omar Guelleh has put forward a proposal to help neighboring
Somalia establish a transitional government and legislative
council, diplomatic sources said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Guelleh, also chairman of the Inter-Governmental Authority
Development, informed Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi of his
proposal last Friday during a stop over at Addis Ababa
international airport.
</P>
<P>
Guelleh's proposal envisages transitional arrangements in which
the entire Somali society will be represented through various
groups, including civil society, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
No details of the talks between Guelleh and Meles were
revealed. But according to Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum
Mesfin's briefing to local mass media, Ethiopia fully supports
Guelleh's peace proposal.
</P>
<P>
Somalia, bordering with Djibouti, Ethiopia and Kenya, has been
without government since the late Siad Barre was ousted from power
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Guelleh has been making effort to beef up a solution to Somali
crisis. He met Meles last November and was promised that Ethiopia
would stand behind Djibouti on the peace initiative.

<HEADLINE> EU Blames Savimbi for Angolan Civil War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Union has
reiterated that the Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi should bear
the main responsibility for the resurgence of civil war in Angola.
</P>
<P>
"It is the organization led by Savimbi that did not respect the
 principal clauses of the Lusaka Protocol," said a statement
issued on Monday by Portugal in the capacity of the EU's rotating
presidency, the official newspaper Jornal de Angola reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This attitude by Savimbi's National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) has thrown doubt upon the sincerity
of its intention to work for the national reconciliation in
Angola, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The EU insists on the political solution to the Angolan civil
war and appeals to UNITA to immediately cease military actions and
have a "serious dialogue" with the Angolan government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, EU urged the Angolan government to create political,
social and economic conditions for establishing a democratic
country.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government vowed to wipe out UNITA rebels after
UNITA failed to disarm and demobilize and hand over towns and
territory under its control to central administration in line with
the last peace pact, signed in Lusaka in November 1994.

<HEADLINE> Russians Break Into Central Grozny: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian troops penetrated
central Grozny early Tuesday and were "gradually expanding the
zone they already control," the Itar-Tass news agency quoted the
Russian military as saying.
</P>
<P>
The federal troops "broke through rebel lines from two
directions" at 9:30 a.m. Moscow time (0630 GMT) and reached the
center of the Chechen capital. Fierce battles were still going on
in the directions where the federal troops were advancing towards
the central square of Grozny, said the headquarters of the Group
of Russian Federal Troops.
</P>
<P>
The report said it would take three or four days for the
military to establish control over the embattled city.
</P>
<P>
The report could not be independently confirmed and officials
were not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass said federal troops were gradually strengthening
their grip on Grozny on the second day of fresh concerted attacks
to flush Islamic rebels out of the city. Fierce fighting was
raging elsewhere in Grozny after a night of heavy artillery and
aerial bombardment.
</P>
<P>
Russian federal units, backed by artillery fire and the air
force, launched a decisive operation to clear Grozny of armed
rebels late Monday, and the circle of Russian units around Islamic
militants had been tightened in all directions, said an earlier
Itar-Tass report. Armed separatists had made in vain several
attempts to break out of the long-besieged city.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, acting President Vladimir Putin said the military
would have to take Grozny before moving to eliminate rebel bases
in the mountains to the south.

<HEADLINE> Maradona to Move to Cuba for Drug rehab Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Argentine soccer star
Diego Maradona will fly to Cuba early on Tuesday to check into a
drug rehabilitation center after recent cocaine-related heart
trauma, the Argentine state news agency Telam reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The former soccer hero, suffering from hypertension and an
regular heart beat when tour in Uruguay tow weeks ago, will travel
at 12:45 a.m. (0345 GMT) on Tuesday to the Cuban capital Havana
according to his personal doctor Alfredo Cahe, Telam said.
</P>
<P>
Maradona, will be accompanied by his wife Claudia Villafane,
his parents, his long-time manager Guillermo Coppola, personal
physician Cahe, a neurologist and a cardiologist.
</P>
<P>
Maradona, who led Argentina to World Cup victory in 1986 in
Mexico, first started taking drugs in 1983 while playing for
Spanish giants Barcelona. The habit led to doping scandals that
helped eat away at his playing prowess until he retired in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen days ago he was admitted to a clinic in the exclusive
Uruguayan resort of Punta del Este with only 38 percent of his
heart tissue functioning. Doctors blamed drugs and alcohol for
what they described as a brush with death.

<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
told visiting Pakistani Chief Executive Pervez Musharaf here today
that China pursues a comprehensive partnership with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
In the new century, China will make new efforts to consolidate
and advance the Sino-Pakistani relations, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
He described China and Pakistan as good neighbors, saying that
the friendship of the two countries, established on the basis of
the fundamental interests of the peoples of the two countries, has
stood the test of time.
</P>
<P>
The mutual understanding and support of the two countries are
due to adhering to the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-Existence,
Jiang added. He stressed that every country has its own culture
and history. It is therefore natural that they take development
paths suitable to their own national conditions.
</P>
<P>
China hopes that Pakistan will maintain social stability and
economic development. Jiang said that China would like to see a
more stable, prosperous Pakistan in the future.
</P>
<P>
China will pursue good relations with all neighboring countries
on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-Existence, and
will never interfere in the internal affairs of other countries,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
China also hopes that countries in the region will resolve all
ethnic and religious conflicts in a peaceful manner, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Musharaf said that his current visit has been fruitful. He
expressed his thanks for the understanding and help China has
offered to Pakistan over the years. Cooperation and friendship
between the two countries should be cemented in the new century.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan hopes that peace and stability will be realized in
South Asia, Musharaf said, adding that Pakistan would like to
resolve peacefully all its problems with India.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan also wants to promote the peaceful settlement of the
Afghanistan issue. Peace and stability should be realized through
establishing an extensively-represented government with all
parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
Musharaf also said that Pakistan opposes all forms of terrorism,
especially terrorist activities carried out in the name of
religion.

<HEADLINE> China to Amend Law for Returned Overseas Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislature is to
amend a law on returned Overseas Chinese and the family members of
overseas Chinese to better protect their rights and interests,
said Li Peng, chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC)
Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
The legislative body should solicit opinions and suggestions
from the broadest cross section of returned Overseas Chinese and
the family members of overseas China for a better law, Li told an
NPC legislation meeting.
</P>
<P>
There are over 30 million overseas Chinese all over the world,
and a roughly equal number of returned overseas Chinese and family
members of overseas China. All of them have played an very
important role in China's economic reform, open-up and
modernization drive, Li noted.
</P>
<P>
"We should improve our work to better protect their legitimate
rights and interests, which will greatly help the country's reform
and opening drive and reunification cause," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Law on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of
Returned Overseas Chinese and the Family Members of Overseas
Chinese was adopted in 1990. However, necessary amendments should
be made to suit the new situation today, Li said.
</P>
<P>
A draft of amendments to the law discussed at today's meeting
held by the NPC's Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee has undergone
two revisions based on public opinion and suggestions from related
departments and special interest groups.
</P>
<P>
One of the most important changes to the law is the addition of
punishment on government organizations, individuals and other
social organizations for infringements of the legitimate rights
and interests of returned overseas Chinese and the family members
of overseas Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The draft amendments also specify procedures for the handling
of disputes that may arise once the amended law is implemented.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The foreign industrial
investors will be required to source up to 60 percent of raw
materials from host countries, the African newspaper reported here
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted General Council Chairman of World Trade
Organization Ali Mchumo as saying that the organization plans to
pass a regulation to ensure foreign investors do not import raw
materials as long as they can be obtained from within the host
countries.
</P>
<P>
Mchumo, who is also Tanzania's ambassador to United Nations
agencies based in Geneva, said WTO wants to enable poor countries
to sell what they have so as to generate income for the betterment
of people's living standards.
</P>
<P>
The advantage of WTO is that each country gets a market share
for its goods, said the chairman. The developing countries need
WTO more than big nations as it stops the rule of the jungle in
the world trade.
</P>
<P>
About 48 least developed nations are represented in the
135-member trade body based in Geneva.

<HEADLINE> Western Donors Agree to Offer Fund for Burundi Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Western donors funding
the Burundi peace talks have pledged to donate two million U.S.
dollars for speeding up the stalled peace process to a final
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
The pledge was made in response to a request by the new
facilitator, former South African President Nelson Mandela, at a
closed-door meeting with those donors attended in Tanzania's north
town of Arusha last Sunday, the African newspaper reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the meeting with donors, Mandela chaired the first
plenary meeting for mediation since his nomination last December
to replace the former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere, who died
of Leukemia last October.
</P>
<P>
Germany had donated 200,000 U.S. dollars while representatives
of Sweden and Denmark said they would be sending their donation
soon after consulting with their governments, spokesman of the
facilitator's team Hashim Mbita was quoted as saying on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Other donors have pledged unspecified amounts of money, but in
general they have agreed to continue supporting the peace process,
said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by about 20 donors, including Canada,
Japan, Britain, Denmark, the United States, Germany and Sweden as
well as international agencies and organizations.
</P>
<P>
According to head of the facilitation team Judge Mark Bomani,
the Burundi peace talks, which resumed in June 1998, have already
swallowed about eight million U.S. dollars so far.
</P>
<P>
The next round of the talks, which begin next month at a date
to be announced later, would need at least two million U.S.
dollars, said Bomani in Arusha on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The funds, said the team leader, are mostly used to pay for the
administrative costs and transportation fees. Some delegates are
living in exile in Europe.

SEOUL, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Forces Korea (USFK)
closed an American school inside the Eighth Army Base in central
Seoul for several hours Tuesday over a bomb threat.
</P>
<P>
A man called the schoolmaster around 7 a.m. Tuesday (2200 GMT
Monday) that he had hid three bombs inside the school campus.
</P>
<P>
All staff members at the South Korean Defense Ministry located
near the school had been also evacuated when the search began.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time within this month that the USFK has
been threatened with bomb explosions.
</P>
<P>
On January 3 this year, the USFK was tipped off from Washington
that bombs stored inside the Camp Edwards in Paju, South Korea,
were set to go off next day, which caused a massive evacuation of
U.S. military personnel from the camp and some 3,000 South Korean
residents around the camp. The bomb threat turned out to be a hoax.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, January 18 (Xinhua) -- A six-month premature baby is
out of danger today after intensive care for almost three months.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Jianhua, chief director in pediatrics at the Number 211
Hospital in Harbin, capital city of Heilongjiang Province in
northeast China, said that the baby will leave incubator soon
unless something unexpected in its condition happens.
</P>
<P>
The baby's mother, 26-year-old Ji Hongyan went into labor at
home when she felt a violent pain in her at the abdomen last
November. The premature baby was only one kilogram at birth.
</P>
<P>
Ji had three abortions and an ectopic pregnancy operation. "I
was in a state of absolute despair when I found out that my baby
was premature, but a faint cry told me that he was still alive,"
Ji said.
</P>
<P>
Doctors injected milk through a stomach pipe from the baby's
nose because the baby could not suck breast milk.
</P>
<P>
The baby's weight has increased to 2.1 kilograms and although
still weak, it can suck milk from its mother's breast, estimated
at 70 milliliters a day. Doctors said that the baby would
sometimes open his eyes and make a smile.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Negotiations with Syria, originally scheduled to resume
Wednesday in Shepherdstown, West Virginia, have been put off
indefinitely, after Syria said it will not return to the table
until Israel agrees to withdraw to the June 4, 1967 border.
</P>
<P>
The major stumbling block seems again to be the agenda. A senior
U.S. official said that the sides have become "increasingly focused
on having their most important needs solved first."
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The chiefs of staff have recently completed a map drawn at
Prime Minister Ehud Barak's request of the June 4, 1967 border on
the Golan Heights. The June 4 lines are those to which Syria
demands Israel withdraw.
</P>
<P>
The army was originally reluctant to furnish the June 4 map,
assuming that there was no chance of Israel consenting to a
withdrawal to those lines. Now various military officials are
wondering whether the drawing of the maps bears a political
message.
</P>
<P>
Maariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Barak met with Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser
Arafat Monday night, trying to iron out some of glitches in the
ongoing talks between the two sides and setting a new, more
realistic goal for reaching a framework agreement on the final-
status talks.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders were originally scheduled to meet in Washington
later in the week, but due to the delay in the Syrian talks, Barak
had to put off his trip to the U.S. and reschedule the meeting for
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Security measures throughout the country are being tightened
after a pipe-bomb blast Monday in the heart of the coastal city of
Hadera, in which 25 people were lightly wounded.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the attack, Barak said his government would take
action with all its might to crush terrorism. He warned that those
against peace would try to derail the peace process as Israel
enters critical stage of negotiations with both the Palestinians
and Syria.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Restore Two Cultural Sites in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has announced
plans to restore two significant cultural sites in Cyprus, one in
the northern area and the other in the southern area.
</P>
<P>
According to Tuesday's local media reports, the Greek Orthodox
Monastery of Apostolos Andreas in the Turkish Cypriots area in the
north and the Muslim mosque of Hala Sultan in the Greek Cypriots
south will be restored.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. spokesman said in New York that, following discussions
with relevant authorities on both sides of the divided island, the
U.N. Development Programme (UNDP) has undertaken "the first phase
of a project to restore two highly significant cultural sites on
the island."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. spokesman quoted Secretary-General Kofi Annan as saying
that he considered this as "a very constructive step forward, one
well-suited to the spirit of the new year."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
That the two communities gave green light to the restoration of
significant sites on their territories of the opposite side's
religion was seen as a goodwill gesture after the two sides held
indirect talks in the United States a month ago.
</P>
<P>
The first round of U.N.-brokered proximity talks on the Cyprus
issue was held in the U.N. headquarters in New York last December,
during which the Greek Cypriot side and the Turkish Cypriot side
contacted through U.N. officials shuttling between them.
</P>
<P>
The talks are scheduled to resume in Geneva on January 31.

<HEADLINE> Abducted Philippine Air Force Chaplain Freed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manila, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Air Force chaplain
Captain Melchor Fernando, who was abducted by the rebel New
Peoples Army (NPA) on January 5, was released unharmed by his
captors at dawn Tuesday, a military report said.
</P>
<P>
Willie Florendo, commanding general of the Philippine Air Force,
said in the report that Fernando got off from a bus in front of
Fernando Air Base in Lipa City in the central Philippines early
Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
From San Fernando Air Base, he was whisked to the Intelligence
Service of the Armed Forces of the Philippines in Camp Aguinaldo,
Quezon City of Metro Manila, where he is now undergoing intensive
debriefing, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Captain Fernando was kidnapped by six NPA rebels while visiting
his four-hectare farm lot in Occidental Mindoro Province in the
central Philippines on January 5. He used to visit his farm lot
three times a month.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that Occidental Mindoro is an area where the
NPA is active, Fernando had never coordinated with the Philippine
Army or the Philippine National Police whenever he visited his
farm, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Fernando was the fifth member of the military or police
kidnapped by the NPA since Brigadier General Victor Obillo was
snatched last February 17. Obillo was released on April 16, 1999,
together with Captain Eduardo Montealto.
</P>
<P>
The NPA rebels are still holding Army Major Noel Buan and
Police Chief Inspector Abelardo Martin in the Southern Tagalog
region.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, they are expected to be released soon
following negotiation conducted by Senator Loren Legarda with
exiled NPA leaders in the Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Vows to Wipe Out Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government will try
to dislodge and wipe out the rebels of the Allied Democratic
Forces (ADF) in Rwenzori mountains, the Monitor daily reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chief of Staff of Uganda People's Defense Forces James Kazini
made the remarks soon after the ADF rebels attacked a refugee camp
in the western district of Bundibugyo over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The recently passed amnesty law is not applied to the rebels,
Kazini said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said the estimated 300 ADF rebels escalated their carnage
on civilian targets as a way of revenge after the army had
captured their mountain camps in Booma, Aggo, Ikafariso, Mukwali,
Kasule and Mutunga on the Congolese side.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that despite the difficult terrain in the area, it
would not take long for the government troops to finish the ADF
rebels.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that President Yoweri Museveni visited the
massacre scene of the refugee camp and met Kazini on Monday.
During the meeting, they mapped out strategies to flush out and
finish the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Over 70 civilians were killed in a wave of ADF rebel attacks
since the beginning of this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman today gave the requirements for the candidate of the
chairman of a new UN arms inspection body for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Bangzao said at a regular press conference Tuesday
afternoon that the new chairman for the United Nations Monitoring,
Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) should possess "
necessary political judgment and considerable experience in the
area of arms control."
</P>
<P>
The new chairman should be "capable of implementing democratic
administration and strict disciplinary restrictions," according to
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The new commission chief must report objectively and truthfully
to the UN Security Council on relevant matters and make no
unauthorized decisions on matters of significant importance, Zhu
added.
</P>
<P>
The deadline has passed for choosing a chairman for the
UNMOVIC, established in accordance with a December 17 UN
resolution to replace the former UNSCOM for dismantling Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Discussions are still going on between concerned parties to
decide on the choice of the chairman, and no consensus has been
reached, Zhu said.
</P>

China hopes that the Security Council would decide on the
candidate for the position at an early date through the joint

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- China sincerely hopes that
Pakistan and India would practically implement the United Nations
Security Council resolution No.1172 and prevent the arms race in
South Asian region from further escalating, said a Chinese foreign
ministry spokesman here today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, Zhu Bangzao, responding to a question concerning
the Kashmir issue at today's routine press conference, pointed out
that due to historical and regional reasons, there are certain
problems existing between south Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, China hopes that all parties concerned would
properly handle their divergence through peaceful negotiations,
and therefore become good neighbors, friends and partners, who
would jointly safeguard regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also talked about Pakistani Chief Executive Pervez Musharaf
's two-day working visit to China. Musharaf, who arrived in
Beijing Monday morning, held talks with Premier Zhu Rongji Monday
afternoon, and met with Chairman of the National People's Congress
Standing Committee Li Peng this morning and President Jiang Zemin
this afternoon. This is Musharaf's first China trip since he took
the post last October.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that China and Pakistan are friendly
neighbors, and China will not interfere in the internal affairs of
Pakistan. China respects the choice made the Pakistani people
themselves and believes that they can handle their own problems
independently, he added.

<HEADLINE> China Clamps Down on "Fake" and Shoddy Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua)-- China will continue to clampdown
on shoddy and inferior products this year, said Zhu Mingxian,
deputy director of the State Bureau of Quality and Technical
Supervision.
</P>
<P>
The latest examination by the Bureau showed that China's
product quality in 1999 was better than 1998, with the qualified
rate reaching 78.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Serious quality problems were found in small-sized enterprises,
with some products reportedly harming people's health. Zhu said
that the number of products vital to the national economy and the
livelihood of the Chinese people lags far behind products from
overseas.
</P>
<P>
A series of clampdowns will be launched by the Bureau to
eliminate "fake" and inferior products such as cigarette, building
materials, automobile components, cosmetics, foods, gas stoves and
medical instruments.
</P>
<P>
More support will be given to producing high-quality products
and famous brand names. China plans to designate 100 streets that
free from shoddy and "fake" products.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Biggest City to Develop Key Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Ho Chi Minh City, the largest
city in Vietnam, will give priority to the development of the four
industries of mechanical engineering,information technology,
biotechnology and new materials, Vietnam News Agency reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The city is conducting a feasibility study on such development
in an effort to turn out high-quality and competitive products to
meet domestic demand, boost exports and help bolster other
industries.
</P>
<P>
Businesses of the four key industries have rearranged their
production lines and improved technology in order to raise quality
and lower production cost.
</P>
<P>
In the recent past, the city has annually spent from 5 to 10
percent of its gross domestic product on renewing and modernizing
enterprises' technology. The ratio must increase to 17-20 percent
per year to meet the goals of the city's development plan.
</P>
<P>
In the information technology development plan for the years up
to 2005, the Ministry of Industry plans to build five plants to
produce and assemble information technology equipment in Ho Chi
Minh City at a cost of 4.62 trillion Vietnamese dong (330 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Although defined as a key industry, mechanical engineering
remains backward. The city plans to spend 150 billion dong(10.7
million dollars) on a project to merge the Sai Gon Machines
Manufacturing Company and the Sinco Machines Manufacturing Company
into a mechanical engineering center.
</P>
<P>
For consumer engineering products, the city has worked out a 44.
7 billion dong (3.19 million dollars) project to produce electric
fans and four projects to produce bicycles with a combined
investment of 35 billion dong (2.5 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The new materials industry is the newest of the city's four key
industries. An estimated amount of 700 million to 800 million
dollars is required for a project to recycle waste and turn out
high-quality materials to meet the country's demand.

<HEADLINE> Beijing SOEs to Have Bigger Say in Paying Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- State-owned enterprises (SOEs)
in Beijing will independently decide how much to pay their staff
as long as they are financially capable of doing that, said
Beijing vice-mayor Liu Haiyan.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Municipal Government is working on a set of
guidelines which will soon be made public, said the vice-mayor at
a meeting attended by more than 400 SOE managers and governmental
officials over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's industrial trade has employed 16,000 college
graduates since 1982. Only 1,015 of them, however, are still
engaged in the trade."The outflow of professionals has badly
restrained the reform and development of the SOEs," Liu noted,
urging the SOEs to take full advantage of the human resources in
Beijing and make more efforts in attracting talent.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Province in south
China recorded a high growth rate of 9 percent in 1999, above the
expected target of 8.5 percent set earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
The province recorded a 758 billion yuan GDP in the first 11
months, up 9.3 percent from the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the increase to the large scale
infrastructure investments, which increased by 12 percent on an
annual basis last year.
</P>
<P>
The province is reducing a number of low-profit industries such
as textile, sugar processing and coal plants. The sugar production
center closed down 20 sugar mills last year.
</P>
<P>
Information and electrical appliance enterprises are witnessing
robust economic growth with the help of preferential policies from
the government.
</P>
<P>
Turnover and profit in the computer manufacturing industry
increased by 49 percent and 98.9 percent respectively in the first
11 month last year, compared with the same period in 1998. Output
of mobile telecommunications equipment, integrate circuit and
microwave ovens recorded double-digit growth.
</P>
<P>
Pu Xinmin, director of the provincial statistics bureau,
predicts that Guangdong's GDP growth rate for year 2000 will be
between 8-8.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong aims to reach a per capita GDP of 5,000 U.S. dollars
by 2010. The per capita GDP in the Pearl River Delta area now
stands at 23,000 yuan (2,745 U.S. dollars).

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Work on a huge textile
production center has just started on the outskirts of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Total investment of 280 million yuan will be spent on the
center, which will focus on various newly-developed textile
products when it officially opens next year.
</P>
<P>
An official with the municipal government said the center is
part of the city's effort to make the textile industry highly
profitable again after its major restructuring over the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
China's textile industry suffered from a surfeit of staff and
inefficiency. China started a three-year reform program to help
the industry become profitable in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, outdated machinery and equipment including
10 million of the country's 46 million spindles in cotton mills
are expected to be scrapped to cut down production capacity and
increase efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has closed 185 cotton mills and reduced its number of
spindles from 2.5 million to less than one million.
</P>
<P>
Last year Shanghai reported 15.8 billion yuan in textile sales,
with profits from the industry amounting to about 200 million yuan.

<HEADLINE> China to Launch Massive Offshore Oil And Gas Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The China National Offshore Oil
Corp (CNOOC) will invest 4.6 billion yuan this year to develop a
number of large offshore oil and gas fields to increase the
country's oil and gas output equivalent to 40 million tons of oil
by 2005.
</P>
<P>
According to CNOOC president Wei Liucheng, China has recently
discovered a group of large oil and gas bearing structures in
Bohai Bay areas and in areas of the South China Sea, including
Penglai 19-3, Panyu 5-1, Caofeidian 11-1, Bozhong 29-4 and Bozhong
25-1.
</P>
<P>
Among them, the Penglai 19-3 is particularly large with 300
million tons of proven crude oil reserves. Penglai 19-3 is likely
to become China's second largest complete oilfield after Daqing by
the latter half of this year and be fully operational by 2004. By
2004 the oilfield expects to develop an annual production capacity
of 15 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The development of other large oilfields such as the second-
phase project of Suizhong 36-1, Qinhuangdao 32-6 and Wenchang 13-1/
2 in the Bohai Bay will be launched this year, and 162 offshore
wells will be sunk.
</P>
<P>
With the development of the new oilfields, China expects an
annual average increase of 20 percent in offshore oil production
between 2000 and 2005.
</P>
<P>
CNOOC produced 16.17 million tons of offshore oil and 4.39
billion cu meters of gas in 1999, earning profits of 2.75 billion
yuan.

<HEADLINE> 2 French Tourists Kidnapped in Yemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Two French tourists, a married
couple, were kidnapped by tribesmen in northwestern Yemen on
Monday, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The tourists, together with their Yemeni driver and guide, were
kidnapped from their car by armed tribesman near the Amran town
about 50 kilometers northwest of Yemeni capital Sanaa, and were
taken to the remote Jawf region in the north, officials said.
</P>
<P>
No other details of the kidnapping or the demands of the
kidnappers were disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Tribesmen, who control large parts of Yemen, frequently kidnap
foreigner workers or tourists to press for economic or political
concessions, like better infrastructure and release of jailed
tribesmen, from their government. Hostages are mostly released
unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
But in December, 1998, Islamic extremists seized 16 westerners
in a kidnaping that ended with three Britons and an Australian
being killed in a shootout with Yemeni soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Yemen, whose tourism industry was gravely hit by frequent
kidnappings, set up special courts to try kidnappers and introduce
the death penalty for the offenders. A special security unit was
established last November to combat terrorism.

<HEADLINE> UAE Has Lowest Child Mortality in Arab World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
has registered the lowest rate of infant mortality in the Arab
world, according to a report issued by the United Nations
Children's Fund(Unicef).
</P>
<P>
The Unicef report, which reviewed children's condition in the
world for the year 2000, classified the UAE as the leading Arab
country in delivering child care, in addition to having the lowest
incidence of mortality for children under the age of five, the
local Gulf News daily said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Child mortality in the UAE has dropped from 223 cases per 1000
deliveries in 1960 to only 10 cases per thousand in 1998, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
These figures reflect the high standard of health care provided
to new-borns and children in the UAE, Abdel Mahfouz, regional
representative of the United Nations Development Program, was
quoted by the paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
He added that Kuwait came second in the Arab world in terms of
the quality of child care, while both Qatar and Oman ranked third
and Bahrain ranked fourth.
</P>
<P>
On the international level, he said, Sweden, Norway and Japan
had recorded the lowest incidence of child deaths.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Puppet Leader Questioned by State Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait's state security
investigators interrogated on Monday Al Aa Hussein, head of the
puppet Kuwaiti government set up by Iraq during its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Al Aa was grilled for three hours before being sent back to the
Central Jail, local English daily Arab Times reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The interrogation focused on Al Aa's relations with the Iraqi
government and the testimony given by other eight members in the
so-called interim government, the newspaper quoted informed sources
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Al Aa was questioned about his relations with
the Iraqi ruling party and why he decided to stay in Iraq after the
end of the 1991 Gulf war that liberated Kuwait from the seven-month
Iraqi occupation.
</P>
<P>
Al Aa Hussein, accompanied by his four children, returned to
Kuwait early Friday morning aboard a Dutch flight with a Norwegian
travel document valid for only one trip.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested by state security and taken to the Central
Prison immediately after the entry. His children were handed over
to their relatives here.
</P>
<P>
Al Aa, once a young lieutenant in the Kuwaiti army, along with
other eight who worked in the Ministry of Defense, was said to be
taken to Iraq just a few days after the invasion on August 2, 1990.
</P>
<P>
It was announced later that they had formed the provisional
(Kuwaiti) government, headed by Al Aa.
</P>
<P>
After the liberation of Kuwait, the eight men were released at
the Kuwaiti border and each given 50,000 U.S. dollars by Iraq. As
they said on their return they were forced to cooperate with the
Iraqi regime, Kuwaiti legal authorities, which found their claims
genuine, acquitted them of any wrong-doing.
</P>
<P>
But Al Aa, who left Iraq for Norway about two years ago, was
issued a death sentence by a Kuwaiti court in 1991 on charges of
high treason.
</P>
<P>
The main aim he choose to return to Kuwait was, in his own
words, to appeal against the death sentence. His lawyer Khalid
Abdel Jaileel has submitted a petition objecting the death sentence
and the state criminal court has decided to start examining the
case on February 20.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local reports said that conditions around a house
used to be inhabited by Al Aa were quite normal. Kids were playing
in front the house, near which no additional security was observed.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Leaders to Appeal Expulsion From Jordan: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Four leaders of the Palestinian
Islamic Resistance Movement, known as Hamas, will appeal their
expulsion from Jordan at the Higher Court of Justice of the
kingdom, the semiofficial Jordan Times reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The leaders, including head of the Hamas Political Bureau Chief
Khaled Meshal and spokesman Ibrahim Ghosheh, were expelled to Qatar
after weeks of detention following an unprecedented government
crackdown in Jordan that started from last August.
</P>
<P>
Ghosheh told the Jordan Times from Doha, capital of Qatar, that
they had attained a Jordanian attorney to challenge the "expulsion
order" by the Jordanian government in the Higher Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
The government declined to comment on the Hamas decision, but
officials here said the Hamas leaders would be jailed and tried in
a court if they return to the kingdom, as the court case against
them was not dropped but shelved pending any future developments.
</P>
<P>
They were flown to Doha on November 21, 1999 after being freed
under a Royal Decree by Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein upon
request from Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Ben Khalifa Thani who
mediated in the Hamas crisis in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The Hamas leaders, all Jordanian citizens, had been rounded up
with 20 other Hamas members operating in Jordan, and faced charges
of taking part in an illegal foreign organization, illegal
possession of arms and ammunition, and trying to conduct anti-
Israel military exercises in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Hamas presence in the kingdom had long been tolerated as it
enjoyed widespread sympathy among Jordanians, over 60 percent of
whom have Palestinian origins.
</P>
<P>
The government shuts the door to Hamas upon pressure from the
United States, Israel and Palestinian authorities last August, when
Israel and the Palestinians looked set to resume their final status
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Hamas remained opposed to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process
and it is also critical of Jordan`s 1994 peace treaty with the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
It is still engaged in a holy war aimed at liberating all
Palestinian territories occupied by Israel in successive Middle
East wars, and it had claimed responsibilities for several deadly
attacks on Israeli civilian targets in the past decade.

In November 1999, receipts from exports gained 18.8 percent to

Accounting for 40.7 percent of the import bill, capital goods
were the top purchase for the month of November, followed by raw
materials and intermediate goods and consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
The NSO said for November 1999, the United States was the

NAIROBI, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Department of Defence
has recently issued a high alert circular to all the military
units to counter threats posed by international terrorist
organizations.
</P>
<P>
International terrorist groups linked to Saudi fugitive Osman
bin Latin may have targeted Kenya's military installations for
attack, the East African Standard newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Shilling Gains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan shilling gained
substantially against the U.S. dollar from around 75 shillings
last November to 69 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
On the first trading day of this week, the shilling gained 1.88
 shillings against the dollar in the wholesale market, averaging
67.97 buying and 70.22 selling. This represents a 2.58 percent
gain on last Friday's rates.
</P>
<P>
It also rose 3.76 percent against the euro to 70.90 shillings
buying and 71.17 shillings selling.
</P>
<P>
The shilling stood at around 60 to one dollar in January last
year and weakened straight to 75 in November.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan currency has been rallying against the major trading
 currencies since last November, due to the signs that the
International Monetary Fund would resume aid to the east African
country.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Attacked for Delay in Sending Peacekeepers to Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Stan
Mudenge has attacked the United Nations for dragging its feet on
the deployment of peacekeeping forces in the Democratic Republic
of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Mudenge told a meeting of the Political Committee which began
here on Monday that it was disappointing that the U.N. continued
to drag its feet in pursuing lengthy and phased approach in the
deployment of the requested forces.
</P>
<P>
He said even the deployment of the proposed 500 military
observers had also fallen victim to this approach.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Political Committee, comprising foreign ministers
and rebel representatives of the signatories to the Lusaka peace
accord, to hold discussions on the violations of the cease-fire
agreement to preserve the credibility of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Our discussions should seek to strengthen and not weaken the
agreement, neither should it degenerate into an exchange of
accusations and counter accusations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Let it result in a reaffirmation of our common resolve to
respect the cease-fire agreement," he added.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is the current chairman of the committee, set to look
at political developments and ratify resolutions of the recent
Joint Military Commission (JMC) meeting.
</P>
<P>
One of the major tasks of the JMC is to monitor the
implementation of the cease-fire in DRC and investigate all
cease-fire violations brought to its attention.
</P>
<P>
President of the DRC Laurent Kabila and his allies Zimbabwe,
Angola and Namibia signed a ceasefire agreement in July last year
with Rwanda and Uganda which back rebel groups to topple Kabila.
The rebel factions signed the pact in the following month.
</P>
<P>
Since then, fighting has flared on several fronts and warring
sides frequently accuse each other of violating the pact.

<HEADLINE> Motorola Fourth-Quarter Profits More Than Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Motorola Inc. Monday posted
a fourth-quarter profit that was just slightly ahead of Wall
Street's estimates, as stronger sales of wireless handsets and
semiconductors offset declines in some of the company's other
business segments.
</P>
<P>
Excluding special charges, Motorola logged earnings of 514
million U.S. dollars, or 82 cents per share in the last three
months of 1999, up from 159 million dollars, or 26 cents per
diluted share during the fourth quarter of 1998. Analysts polled
by earnings tracker First Call had expected Motorola to post a
profit of 81 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
The company's bottom line, however, was weighed down by its
exposure to
financially troubled Iridium LLC, a global satellite telephone
company that Motorola helped finance, according to reports from
the company.
</P>
<P>
Even so, executives at the Illinois-based maker of computer
chips and telecommunications equipment said they are on track for
continued strong revenue growth in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Sales were 8.5 billion dollars, 2 percent higher from the 8.3
billion dollars in fourth-quarter sales one year ago, Motorola
said.
</P>
<P>
For all of 1999, Motorola said its net income was 1.3 billion
dollars, or 2.08 dollars per share, excluding special charges.
</P>
<P>
Motorola executives attributed the most recent quarter's strong
showing largely to increased sales of wireless handsets and
semiconductors.
</P>
<P>
"This quarter culminates a year in which we achieved
significant improvement in financial performance from our digital
wireless phone and semiconductor businesses and benefited from our
corporate-wide restructuring actions," Robert L. Growney, Motorola
's president and chief operating officer, said in a press release
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We have also made investments and formed promising alliances
in third-generation wireless, Internet, broadband and
semiconductor technologies," Growney added.
</P>
<P>
Motorola is the world's second largest cellular phone maker,
after Nokia of Sweden.

<HEADLINE> Two Million Chinese Children Benefit From Project Hope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, January 18 (Xinhua) -- More than 2.2 million rural
children who dropped out of school have returned to classrooms in
China thanks to Project Hope.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide charitable program started in 1990 to help
school dropouts get back into school, said an education official
at a recent national work conference in the field.
</P>
<P>
In the past 10 years, the country has received over 1.78
billion yuan (214 million U.S. dollars) in donations and sent 2.29
million children back to school, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Donations have helped Chinese education departments at all
levels set up 7,549 Hope Primary Schools, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Starting last year, the project initiated a special program to
provide opportunities for the returned pupils to receive further
education after they complete elementary school.
</P>
<P>
Project Hope will carry out diversified educational programs in
the next five years including re-training for primary school
teachers, on-line education and adult education.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Subway Reopens to Traffic after Blackout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- A subway linking Tian'anmen
Square with the eastern part of Beijing was reopened this morning
after 24-hour closure due to a sudden power failure.
</P>
<P>
The accident happened when water from a broken pipeline
inundated a transformer substation at Wangfujing Station, at about
one o'clock Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Power to the Fuxingmen-Bawangfen subway which connects the old
westbound subway was shut down. It runs through the city's busiest
areas, including the Tian'anmen Square and the Wangfujing shopping
district.
</P>
<P>
The 13.5-kilometer line was opened to traffic last September
taking ten years to build and cost 7.57 billion yuan (about 900
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Beijing now has two intersecting subway lines with a total
length of 54 kilometers.

<HEADLINE> China's Imports increase Dramatically in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- According to the General
Administration of Customs, China's imports in 1999 grew at a
remarkable rate of 18.2 percent, the highest growth since 1994.
</P>
<P>
The total imports reached 165.8 billion US dollars out of a
total foreign trade volume of 360.7 billion US dollars. Exports
grew 6.1 percent to 194.9 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Imports of both primary products and industrial goods increased.
Among the primary products, the imports of timber, paper pulp,
crude oil and refined oil increased dramatically.
</P>
<P>
Imports of chemical products, steel and non-ferrous products,
machinery, electronic products, and electric appliances also
increased.
</P>
<P>
China's imports from its top ten trading partners increased as
well. Imports from Australia grew by the largest margin of 33.3
percent. Imports from the European Union increased by 23.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Import growth rate from Japan, the Association of Southeast
Asia Nations (ASEAN), Russia, the Republic of Korea and the United
States all topped ten percent.
</P>
<P>
Trade experts say that import increases are due to two leading
factors. One is the intensified strikes against smuggling, which
resulted in a surge of normal imports. The other is the domestic
demand for hi-tech products and industrial raw materials.
</P>
<P>
Trade experts predict that imports will continue to grow this
year.

<P>
MACAO, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The newly-established Liaison
Office of the Central People's Government in the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) will, as always, faithfully carry out
the "one country, two systems" principle and contribute more to
Macao's stability and prosperity, the liaison office's director
Wang Qiren said here Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
All staff of the liaison office will abide by the principles of

</P>
<P>

<P>
WELLINGTON, January 18 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Agriculture
Minister Jim Sutton said here Tuesday that he questioned the
legality of U.S. moves to give "handsome" subsidies to domestic
sheep farmers, and would be consulting Australia on how to jointly
respond.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the U.S. Agriculture Department has
announced that U.S. sheep producers will get 100 million U.S.
dollars in government subsidies, loans and other assistance to
help them cope with imports from Australia and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Sutton said the move of the U.S. government would be "damaging"
to the interests of New Zealand and Australian sheep farmers.
</P>
<P>
"The new subsidies are inconsistent with the principles of fair-
trading," he said.
</P>
<P>
"From our point of view," he added, "this subsidy simply
exacerbates what we regard as an illegal action of instituting a
very high level of tariff protection."
</P>
<P>
Sutton said he would be consulting his Australian counterparts
on how to respond to the U.S. protectionist move.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Enforce Intellectual Property Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Tuesday pledged
to strengthen its enforcement of intellectual property laws.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government is committed to the provision of a
strong intellectual property law and an efficient and cost-
effective intellectual property system, Domestic Trade and
Consumer Affairs Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The government is amending the Patents Act 1983, the Copyright
Act 1987 and the Trade Marks Act 1976, he said when opening a
regional World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) forum
here.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is also enacting new legislation on layout designs of
integrated circuits and geographical indications to comply with
the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreement on Trade Related
Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) which came into
force on January 1, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The initiatives are only the beginning of a process of
reviewing and adapting our intellectual property laws, policies
and system to suit the global environment and to cater for the
growing needs of the local industry," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that to further enhance the role of the Intellectual
Property Office under his ministry, the government had decided to
upgrade the status of the office to that of an autonomous
organization.
</P>
<P>
With the upgrading which was expected to be carried out this
year,he said the body would be able to employ better qualified
workforce from among local and foreign experts to beef up
enforcement activities.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia is also seriously looking into the possibility of
acceding to more treaties and conventions under the auspices of
WIPO," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said his ministry had also established a special
Copyright Task Force to ensure adequate copyright protection and
concerted as well as sustained enforcement actions by the relevant
public and private sectors to contain piracy.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is committed to the protection of intellectual
property and always strives to bring its level at par with
international norm and standards.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia recognized that in recent years, the
intellectual property regime had been propelled into the forefront
as an engine of economic growth and in stimulating the flow of
foreign investment,encouraging transfer of technology and
enhancing trade.
</P>
<P>
"An efficient intellectual property system is very important
for the Malaysian Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC), a global test-
bed for companies, both local and international, to test the
limits of technology and prepare themselves for changes brought
about by the information technology age," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said there was a clear need for international consultation
on related issues such the question of jurisdiction, the choice of
laws and enforcement of foreign judgments.
</P>
<P>
The three-day Asian-Pacific regional forum, organized by the
Malaysian government in cooperation with WIPO and the Japanese
Patent Office, is focusing on the enforcement of intellectual
property rights with particular reference to the TRIPS agreement.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Property Market Expected to Match Pre-Crisis Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 18 (Xinhua) -- A property consultant,
valuer and real estate agent has predicted that as the local
property market shapes up, the value and volume of property
transactions this year are likely to match those of the pre-crisis
era.
</P>
<P>
"The trend is picking up again to that prior to 1997," Raine &AMP;
Horne International Zaki &AMP; Partners Sdn Bhd President Zaki H. Said
said at a media briefing Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The value and volume of property transacted in year 2000 are
likely to hover around the 1997 figures, which were about 52.2
billion ringgit (13.736 billion U.S. dollars) and 274,749 units
respectively, Zaki said.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the property market was still soft but showed signs of
a modest recovery. The value transacted nationwide in the year
increased by about 15.7 percent to 32.1 billion ringgit (8.447
billion dollars) from 27.9 billion ringgit (7.342 billion dollars)
in the preceding year while the volume was up by about 15 percent
to 215,237 units from 186,077, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Zaki, the office sector was still facing an
oversupply situation which would take one-and-a-half to two years
to fill up the empty space.

<HEADLINE> China Expects Better Investment Environment in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- According to the latest issue
of the "China Economic Times", China's fixed asset investment will
further increase this year.
</P>
<P>
China's fixed asset investment in 1999 was 2.2 trillion yuan,
an increase of 7.8 percent over 1998. Despite the lower growth
rate than expected at the beginning of last year, the investment
increase last year had stimulated the country's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will continue to promote its pro-active
fiscal policies, including the issuing of some 100 billion yuan
long-term construction bonds to invest in infrastructure projects
and for technological updating in China's enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Possible tax reductions are expected to accelerate investment
growth in the fixed assets sector.
</P>
<P>
China will also introduce new policies to help boost fixed
assets, including the amendment of the "Company Law" to support
the development of new and high-tech enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Many investors see the enormous potential of investing in China
's western regions. China's upcoming entry into The WTO will also
create new opportunities for investment in fixed assets. Experts
predict that the entry will reverse the declining trend of foreign
investment and help social investors regain their confidence.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that China's fixed asset investment will
maintain an upward momentum this year. Other types of investment
will also grow at a faster rate.
</P>
<P>
All kinds of investment entities such as domestic enterprises
and foreign companies will work together to promote and develop
fixed asset investments in China.

<HEADLINE> Thai Ministry Rejects Calls for AIDS Drug Licensing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Thai Public Health Minister
Korn Dabbaransi had rejected AIDS activists' call for compulsory
licensing of didanosine (DDI), an expensive anti-retroviral drug,
the Bangkok Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The activists had insisted the Thai government invoke the
Intellectual Property Rights Law to impose compulsory licensing
and end the monopoly on DDI so that the price of the drug can be
brought down.
</P>
<P>
Despite the rejection by the minister, activists vowed to
continue putting pressure both at home and abroad, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Korn said his ministry has decided instead to permit
the Government Pharmaceutical Organization to manufacture DDI in
powdered form, which is not under patent.
</P>
<P>
The move would help cut the retail price of DDI by about 10
baht (26 U.S. cents) from the current price of about 45 baht (1.2
dollars) per 100mg tablet.
</P>
<P>
At the current price, the drug is accessible to less than 10
percent of Thailand's AIDS victims.
</P>
<P>
Bristol-Myers Squibb, the U.S.-based pharmaceutical giant,
which has the monopoly on the drug, only addressed the matter by
saying that it is being discussed at the international level.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the World Health Organization's
representative to Thailand voiced support from his organization
for moves to impose compulsory licensing for DDI.
</P>
<P>
Local production under compulsory licensing would reduce the
price of DDI to less than 25 baht (66 cents) per tablet,
benefiting a large number of HIV-positive persons.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Firm Applies New Technology to Gene Analysis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 17 (Xinhua) -- A new technology was
successfully applied to the corn genome, a U.S. company engaging
in the discovery and development of gene-based agricultural
products said Monday.
</P>
<P>
GeneThresher sequencing is a new gene finding tool to discover
genes within a plant genome without sequencing the repetitive
content, said Orion Genomics in a report. The technology could
reduce the time and cost a comprehensive analysis of the corn
genome is required by more than 10-fold over existing methods.
</P>
<P>
The secret behind the efficiency of GeneThresher technology is
its ability to rapidly identify and isolate only the 8 percent of
the corn genome's 2,600 megabases of DNA likely to contain genes,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
By comparison with the publicly available data for other plant
species, the report said, the GeneThresher database exclusively
samples this gene-rich portion and not the repetitive content.
</P>
<P>
The GeneThresher technology was invented by three scientists at
Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the lab recently showed that the bulk of the
repetitive, intergenic, non-coding DNA in corn is methylated, and
therefore distinguishable from genes. They have also demonstrated
that much of this methylated, non-coding DNA can be eliminated by
"filter cloning" genomic libraries in a series of engineered
bacterial strains.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has launched a five-
year program to develop a 728-km road network at a cost of 26
million U.S. dollars with foreign assistance, the Road Development
Authority (RDA) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will
provide a loan of 12.6 million dollars to a road improvement
project to rehabilitate 680 km of roadway with 47 bridges, said a
spokesman for the RDA.
</P>
<P>
Another project covering 48 km with eight bridges on the
Ratnapura-Beragala road at a cost of 7 million dollars and the
widening of the Sri Lanka-Japanese Friendship Bridge at a cost of
6.4 million dollars will be funded by the Overseas Economic
Cooperation Fund (OECF) of Japan.
</P>
<P>
The road development program is aimed at developing roads in

to reduce unemployment, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Work on four major national highways at a cost of 720 million
dollars is also due to commence soon, he said. These highways are
the Colombo-Katunayake Expressway, Southern Express Highway,
Colombo-Kandy Expressway and the Outer Circular Road.
</P>
<P>
A total of 700 km of roads have been rehabilitated and
construction work is in progress on 61 bridges with the assistance

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Economic Growth to Exceed 4 Pct This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's economic growth is
projected to exceed 4 percent this year, while the inflation rate
is expected to reach 5 percent, according to the Central Bureau of
Statistics (BPS).
</P>
<P>
"The gross domestic product (GDP) could be higher than 4
percent if economic stability keeps improving, and then (it) also
depends on (raw materials) import. If import improves GDP will
also be better," BPS Chairman Sugito Suwito said.
</P>
<P>
During 1999, imports of raw materials were down in general, but
showed an improvement towards the end of the year, he was quoted
by the Bisnis Indonesia Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Suwito said salary hikes for government officials and the
reduction in oil and electricity subsidies would affect the
inflation figure this year.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that year-on-year inflation this year would exceed
5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The central bank, Bank Indonesia, earlier projected that the
GDP in 2000 would grow by 3 to 4 percent with an inflation rate of
between 3 and 5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Phosphate Fertilizer Plant Set up in Guizhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, January 18 (Xinhua) -- A company in northeast China
has merged a chemical plant in southwest China's Guizhou province
to set up a phosphate fertilizer enterprise with a total
investment of 900 million yuan (108 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Zhou Furen, general manager of the Xiyang Fireproof Materials
Company in the city of Haicheng in Liaoning Province, said they
set up the phosphate fertilizer plant in Guizhou to respond to the
government's call for developing the western regions.
</P>
<P>
"We'll seize the moment to develop our business when the
government is carrying out strategies in the western areas," he
said.
</P>
<P>
His company is China's biggest manufacturer of magnesium
products and top tax payer in Liaoning province.
</P>
<P>
He said the phosphate fertilizer plant will be completed and
put into operation next year. By then it will be capable of
producing one million-ton compound fertilizers and earn 1.7
billion yuan per year.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou is known for its abundant resources of phosphor and
electricity, but inadequate capital and poor transportation and
telecommunications have hindered economic development in the
province.
</P>
<P>
The western areas including Guizhou are expecting an influx of
government funds and investments from both home and abroad after
the government launched its western regions development campaign
last year.
</P>
<P>
The vast western areas cover 56 percent of the country's
territory and hold 50 percent of China's verified mineral deposits.

<HEADLINE> North China Coal Province Reduces Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, January 18 (Xinhua) -- North China's coal province,
Shanxi, will focus on developing clean energy, new and hi-tech
industries and highlight agriculture in the next decade, in a move
to reduce the output of raw coal, once the pillar industry for the
whole province.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi's abundance of coal resources used to contribute to the
country's economic growth. But the rapid growth of exploitation
and accessory industries with low added value and low profits have
led to a serious pollution problem in the area.
</P>
<P>
Also, the falling coal prices in the last few years have
resulted in great economic losses for the province, with the
figure for the last two years alone reaching around 5 billion yuan
(600 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The yield of raw coal has been reduced from 330 million tons to
today's 240 million tons, and the provincial government has put
more effort into the development of industries with high added
values, such as electricity and coal gas.
</P>
<P>
The province has already chosen information, bio-
pharmaceuticals, new materials and energy industries as its main
economic driving forces for the future, and has earmarked 600
million yuan for their development.
</P>
<P>
In the next few years, Shanxi will focus on expanding its local
agricultural products, deep-processing industries, new and high
technology, tourism and service sectors.
</P>
<P>
China's central government has concentrated more on sustainable
development, aiming to increase the national economy while at the
same time reducing environmental damage as much as possible.

<HEADLINE> Arctic Storm Hits Eastern Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- An arctic storm is descending
upon eastern Canada, with New Brunswick and Nova Scotia bearing
the brunt of the snowfall, reports reaching here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Vehicles were being buried Monday morning in New Brunswick,
where the storm was bringing in more than 35 centimeters of snow
on the average to make travel in the southern part of the province
nearly impossible, local media said.
</P>
<P>
Storms carried snow at up to 80 kilometers an hour to Nova
Scotia, another Atlantic Canadian province, which saw an average
snowfall of 25 centimeters, the heaviest since the beginning of
the winter season.
</P>
<P>
On Nova Scotia's south shore, snowplow drivers were battling
snow drifts of two meters high, said the local media.
</P>
<P>
Most schools and shopping malls in the provincial capital of
Halifax were closed, while the Halifax airport had to cancel
flights as a result of poor visibility.
</P>
<P>
In eastern cities such as Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto,
temperatures fell to their lowest since the beginning of the year.
Toronto saw a record low of about minus 26 degrees Centigrade with
the wind-chill factor Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
The arctic air triggered an extreme cold-weather "emergency" in
the country's largest city, where street patrols are being
mobilized to ensure "a 24-hour service that picks up the homeless
and takes them to available shelters," city officials said.
</P>
<P>
The city funds 50 hostels for about 4,500 people with a special
Street Helpline open to the public to help anyone sleeping outside,
according to the media.
</P>
<P>
The cold air has affected the country's west coast as well. The
arctic air induced a windstorm that has hit Vancouver and left
thousands of residents without power.
</P>
<P>
The cold wind, snow and low temperatures are not yet over,
either, with more snow and cold expected in eastern Canada for the
next few days, local forecasts said.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Commander of the
Colombian Military Forces General Fernando Tapias condemned
guerrilla attacks over the weekend in five of the country's
departments as acts of terrorism that seriously damaged the
country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Tapias said in a statement that the worst attack was made by
the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the country's
largest guerrilla movement, on the Bogota-Villavicencio road,
where an explosive charge transported in a vehicle exploded at the
entrance to the Quebradablanca Tunnel. Three rebels were killed in
the attack.

<HEADLINE> Barak Asks Arafat to Postpone Framework Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak asked Palestinian President Yasser Arafat on Monday to
postpone the February deadline for a final-status framework
agreement by two months, senior Israeli sources said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders discussed the possibility of postponing the
deadline, set by the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum signed last
September, at a closed-door meeting held at an undisclosed
location in central Israel late Monday night, according to sources
close to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, they also negotiated the postponement of
the third-stage Israel Defense Forces' withdrawal from the West
Bank, but no further information was given by the sources.
</P>
<P>
Barak offended the Palestinians on Sunday by announcing he
would put off the third-stage handover, in which Israel was due to
withdraw another 6.1 percent of the West Bank on January 20.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Barak and Arafat had not been scheduled
because it had expected that Barak would have a three-side meeting
with Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington on
Thursday, one day after the third-round talks between Barak and
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shara resumed there.
</P>
<P>
But officials in Barak's office announced Monday night that the
planned Israeli-Syrian talks were postponed indefinitely because
of their sharp differences over the fate of the Golan Heights,
which were occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Thus, Barak canceled the plan to fly to Washington and proposed
this surprise meeting with Arafat to iron out some of the glitches
in the ongoing talks between them.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum, Israelis and Palestinians
should reach a framework agreement on the final-status issues by
February 13 and a final accord on permanent peace by September 13.
</P>
<P>
But since officially started in last November, the permanent-
status negotiations between Israeli chief negotiator Oded Eran and
his Palestinian counterpart Yasser Abed Rabbo had failed to make
substantial progress.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, fighting against losing momentum completely, had
invited Arafat to Washington this week to hear his stands on the
permanent-status negotiations.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Russia has formally
voiced its opposition to U.N. chief Kofi Annan's nomination of
Swedish diplomat Rolf Ekues as the chairman of the new U.N. arms
regime for Iraq, U.N. diplomats said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The diplomats said Russia's Ambassador to the United Nations,
Sergei Lavrov, wrote to the President of the United Nations
Security Council, Richard Holbrooke of the United States, and
informed him of their position.
</P>
<P>
Annan this morning notified the Security Council of his choice
of Ekues as the Executive Chairman of the United Nations
Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC),
created by a Council resolution December 17 to replace the now
defunct United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The resolution requested that the U.N. Secretary-General
appoint the chairman within 30 days after the adoption of the
resolution, subject to approval of the 15-member Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Ekeus was the first Executive Chairman of UNSCOM, serving from
1991 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
The diplomats said the Security Council was scheduled to meet
Tuesday afternoon for further consultations on the nominee.

<HEADLINE> Bradley, Gore Debate on Race Issues in Iowa State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Democratic Senator Bill
Bradley and Vice-President Al Gore debated on race relations
Monday night in Iowa state as the country marked the birthday of
Martin Luther King, the slain civil rights leader.
</P>
<P>
Bradley challenged Gore to demand that President Bill Clinton
issue an immediate order banning racial profiling, but Gore shot
back saying, "I don't think President Bill Clinton needs a lecture
from Senator Bill Bradley" on standing up for blacks and Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
Racial profiling is the practice by which some police officers
target racial minorities for traffic stops, and both Gore and
Bradley said firmly that they are against it.
</P>
<P>
"Racial profiling is particularly pernicious," said Bradley,
who said that as president, he would issue an executive order
outlawing the practice.
</P>
<P>
Gore said he would do likewise and send legislation to Congress
to outlaw it.
</P>
<P>
In their sixth and final debate in Iowa before next Monday's
kickoff caucuses in the state, the two Democratic presidential
contenders dwelt on a number of racially sensitive issues.
</P>
<P>
The two Democrats pledged support for continued efforts to
promote civil rights and combat racism. Blacks account for a small
minority of the vote in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
Gore is the national front-runner by far in the public opinion
polls, and also is hoping for a clear triumph over Bradley in Iowa
next week.
</P>
<P>
Bradley, however, leads in polls in New Hampshire, which holds
the first primary eight days after Iowa's caucuses for
presidential nomination.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's KONI Names Training Center Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Sports
Council (KONI) Monday named Arie Sudewo, deputy chairman of KONI,
as training director for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney and the 2001
Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in Kuala Lumpur next year.
</P>
<P>
Arie said that he was very surprised with the announcement.
</P>
<P>
"I never request any assignments but I never decline them
either. This is an honor to do my duty for my country through
sports competition. I will give my best, and I hope the sports
society will give their support during the training programs," he
was quoted by the Jakarta Post Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
KONI Secretary-General Rudolf S. Warouw said Arie has been
chosen following thorough consideration of the input of a number
of sporting federations.
</P>
<P>
Warouw said that none of the officials objected to Arie's
appointment despite his failure to become Indonesia's chef de
mission in the 1995 SEA Games in Chiang Mai, Thailand. Indonesia,
who were the reigning champions at that time, were badly
outclassed by the hosts who surpassed them in the medal standings.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, I can see that he has learned his lesson and taken
the positive side from it. He now acknowledges and recognizes more
of the athletes' needs and conditions than he ever could," he
added.
</P>
<P>
All Indonesian athletes are expected to enter the training
center which is scheduled to open early next month.
</P>
<P>
Arie said about 40 athletes would likely compete in the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"They have been prepared by each sports organization. We will
start the centralized training program officially on February 1.
We will try hard to achieve better than in the last Olympics," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia won only one gold medal -- from badminton men's
doubles Ricky Subagja and Rexy Mainaky -- during the 1996 Olympics
in Atlanta, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Arie said the training program for the 2001 SEA Games would
start after the National Games (PON) is held in Surabaya, capital
of East Java, in June.
</P>
<P>
"The best performers in PON have a great chance to join the SEA
Games' centralized training program. Some of the Olympics athletes
will join their compatriots in the program after September," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia aims to reclaim its overall title from Thailand after
its athletes' poor showing in the 1999 SEA Games in Brunei
Darussalam where they only brought home 44 golds, 43 silvers and
58 bronzes.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Host Southeast Asia Fencing Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will host the fifth
Southeast Asia Fencing Federation (SEAFF) championships from
January 29 to February 2 in Surabaya, capital of East Java, which
had been delayed for two years.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Fencing Association (Ikasi) Secretary-General
Surjono said that 10 events would be featured at the championships.
</P>
<P>
He said the events would be men's and women's teams and
individual foil, men's and women's teams and individual epee and
men's team and individual sabre.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia is fielding 20 junior fencers from 26 provinces. We
have set a policy to allow young fencers to compete in regional
events in order to increase their experience and to encourage
regeneration," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Surjono said senior fencers might skip the championships as
they were preparing for the 15th National Games, which will also
take place in Surabaya in June.
</P>
<P>
He said Ikasi targeted the fencers to win the Widarsa Cup in
this championships.
</P>
<P>
"Filipino fencers are now holding the Cup after being the
overall champion in the fourth SEAFF championships," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia only brought home one silver in the fourth
championships, which was held in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
According to Surjono, three of five fencing associations in
Southeast Asia, excluding host Indonesia, had registered their
fencers.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia are fielding 20 fencers, Brunei Darussalam 11 men's
fencers and Singapore five women's fencers. The Philippines and
Thailand have yet to register," he said.
</P>
<P>
The championships should have taken place in Jakarta in 1998
but it was canceled due to security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Ikasi Chairman H.M. Widarsadipradja, who is also the SEAFF
president, wants fencing to be performed periodically at the
regional level.
</P>
<P>
"Southeast Asia fencers' skills are far below their colleagues
from Asia and other continents, especially Europe. The SEAFF
championships are expected to serve as a milestone before those
fencers can compete in the Asian or even world championships,"
Surjono said.
</P>
<P>
No Southeast Asian fencers won medals in the 1998 Asian Games
in Bangkok, he added.

<HEADLINE> Pipeline Networks Tackle Yangtze Sewage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, January 18 (Xinhua)-- China's largest pipeline
project to purify the sewage of the Yangtze and Jialing Rivers has
gone into construction in Chongqing, a municipality directly under
the Central Government, in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that about 700 million tons of untreated waste
water is discharged into the Yangtze River and its branch Jialing
every year, which has seriously polluted the river valleys and
posed a vital threat to the ecological environment of the Three
Gorges area.
</P>
<P>
Some state departments together with the Chongqing Municipal
government are taking active roles in dealing with the sewage
pollution in the area.
</P>
<P>
In the first phase of the sewage treatment project that is
planned to be completed in the year 2004, a 92-kilometer
underground pipeline network will be built up to collect daily
household waste water. Two sewage plants with the daily processing
capacity of 800,000 tons and 400,000 tons each will also be set up
to purify the sewage water transported by a main 72-kilometer-long
pipeline.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank and the Chinese State Development Bank (SDB)
respectively will provide 40 percent and 25 percent in total loans
of 2.7 billion yuan (more than 310 million U.S. dollars) to the
project, and Chongqing Municipality will raise the remainder of
the money.
</P>
<P>
The 6,300-kilometer Yangtze River, China's largest river and
the third largest in the world, flows past Qinghai, Tibet, Yunnan,
Sichuan Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and Shanghai, where
it empties into the East China Sea. Important cities along the way
are Chongqing, Wuhan, Nanjing and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The Jialing River, a main waterway in southwest China's Sichuan
Province, is one of the important tributaries of the Yangtze. It
stretches for 1,000 kilometers through 14 counties in the central
hilly area of the province.

TIANJIN, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The largest port city in north
China, Tianjin, plans to attract more foreign investment in 2000,
according to a foreign trade official.
</P>
<P>
 The city will concentrate on luring foreign direct investment
in finance, insurance, commerce and trade, as well as information
and consulting sectors, said Pi Qiansheng, director of the Tianjin
Foreign Trade and Economic Commission.
</P>
<P>
 Projects offered to foreign partners include hi-tech
industries, railways and harbors construction projects as well as
development of exports processing zones, agriculture demonstration
zones and European-style tourism areas.
</P>
<P>
 The official welcomes medium-sized or small companies to
invest in Tianjin, adding that the city will establish a
consultancy center and market survey services to companies.
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Tianjin will make further efforts to
encourage foreign research and development institutions and
multinational enterprises to establish subsidiaries in the city.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Sichuan Proved to be Origin of Ba Culture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The excavation was conducted at the Luojiaba ruins, a site
covering 20,000 square meters in Xuanhan County. In the initial
dig on a 50-square-meter spot, a large number of relics including
pottery, bronze and iron ware were found buried in 11 layers of
deposits dating back from the late Neolithic age to the Han
Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Judging from the shape, style and materials of the unearthed
relics, archaeologists believe they have the typical feature of
the Ba Culture.
</P>
<P>
The recent discovery proves the Ba Culture originated in
present-day Sichuan Province and the Three Gorges area, instead of
previously-believed western part of Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
The Ba minorities lived in an area in southwest China, with
Sichuan Province as the center at least 3,000 years ago, and
created a unique culture there. The ethnic group was conquered by
the Qin Dynasty around 200 BC. But their rich cultural heritage
still has enormous appeal to people in southwest China.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Compensation for aviation
companies in Australia, hit by the fuel contamination crisis, may
take years to resolve, Mobil said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Australian acting Prime Minister John Anderson said he wanted
an answer from Mobil on what it intended to do about compensation
for those affected by the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"I am optimistic that this company will see that it has an
obligation, a moral responsibility to get in there and see what it
can do to find a constructive way forward with some people who
have been very, very hard hit by this," he told ABC Radio on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But Mobil spokesman Alan Bailey said while the company was
seriously considering the government's demands and those of the
industry, a resolution could take years.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously this is a very complex issue -- it's going to take
some time to resolve and there may well be questions of the
commercial impacts on various stakeholders in the aviation
industry that will take a long time to sort out in entirety," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Legal actions can in some instances take years depending on
how complex the issue is," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority of Australia has grounded
about 5,000 light planes due to the fuel contamination crisis.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Veteran shooting guard Mitch
Richmond, who has suffered through a forgettale season with the
Washington Wizards, today was placed on the injured list with a
fractured right rib.
</P>
<P>
Richmond suffered the injury, which is expected to sideline him
two weeks, in Satureday's loss to the Detroit Pistons. The 34-year-
old Richmond leads the Wizards in scoring at 16.8 points per game
but is shooting just 43.5 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
A six-time All-Star and former member of Dream Team II,
Richmond was acquired from Sacramento in May 1998 and has not
participated in the playoffs since 1996.
</P>
<P>
He does not appear likely to end that streak this seasons as
Washington suffered its fourth straight loss with a 105-101 defeat
to the Boston Celtics last night and remained in last place in the
Atlantic Division with a 12-27 record.

LHASA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- China's Tibet Autonomous Region,
known as the Roof of the World, has stepped up efforts to protect
wild animals in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Police from Tibet's forestry department handled 262 cases
involving smuggling and poaching of wild animals last year,
arresting nine people and fining 365 others. Money and goods
confiscated by police were valued at 12.65 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Qiangtang Nature Reserve in northern Tibet ranked the first

poaching and smuggling of Tibetan antelope and other wild animals
have been on the rise in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
To curb the trend, 17 temporary and regular patrol stations
were set up in the nature reserve.

LONDON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Paolo Di Canio could be in more
trouble with the Football Association (FA) after appearing to make
an obscene gesture to Aston Villa fans.
</P>
<P>
The FA will wait to read the report from referee Graham Poll
but even if he does not mention the incident, the FA could still
take action after Di Canio's middle-finger salute to the Villa
fans was caught on camera.
</P>
<P>
The West Ham striker, who scored a late equaliser in a 1-1 draw
at Upton Park, was also involved in a skirmish with Villa keeper
David James after the final whistle.
</P>

A spokesman said the FA would consider all the evidence over
the next 48 hours before deciding whether to take action against
the Italian, who has repaired his bad-boy image since moving to
West Ham.

<HEADLINE> High Court Rules Tyson Can Stay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- American controversial boxer
Mike Tyson can stay in the UK for his fight later this month after
a women's group lost its legal bid to declare his entry illegal.
</P>
<P>
The pressure group Justice for Women was refused an application
for a judicial review of Home Secretary Jack Straw's decison to
allow the former world heavyweight champion to fly into the UK on
Sunday, despite a rape conviction which would normally have seen
him barred.
</P>
<P>
Following a 90 minute hearing, Justice Sullivan said the degree
of discretion allowed to Straw in decisions of this nature made it
"unarguable" that he had exceeded his powers in granting exemption
to immigration rules.
</P>
<P>
The judge said, even if it had been arguable, it was unlikely
he would have granted a judicial review, due to the practicalities
of stopping the fight at such a late stage.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Because of the effect in financial terms on innocent
third parties, along with many thousands of people who have bought
tickets, it really is inconceivable that the fight should be
halted."
</P>
<P>
Julie Bindel, who heads up Justice for Women, said she was "
very disappointed" and the group was considering taking the matter
further.
</P>
<P>
She said: "What the judge said about the interests of third
parties is somewhat different from our view."

<HEADLINE> New Initiative Launched in Sudan to Ease Political Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Sudan's ruling National
Congress Party (NCP) has launched a new initiative for reshuffling
the government and the party to resolve the political row between
the president and the dismissed parliament speaker.
</P>
<P>
Envoys would be sent to both sides in the coming two days to
bridge the gaps between President Omar Hassan al-Bashir and Speaker
of the dissolved National Assembly (parliament) Hassan al Turabi,
the Sudan News Agency (SNA) reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bashir dissolved the parliament last December and declared a
national state of emergency for three months, which also triggered
a government crisis.
</P>
<P>
While Bashir insisted that he should be granted the post of the
NCP secretary general, the new initiative proposed that Turabi
should retain the post.
</P>
<P>
The NCP executive committee will elect new leaders for the
party, the SNA said, noting that preparations were underway for a
meeting between Bashir and Turabi slated for January 23.
</P>
<P>
However, political observers here ruled out the possibility of
settling the dispute in the near future due to huge gap and intense
power wrestle between the two sides.

CAIRO, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
DUBAI -- The Oman Insurance Company in the United Arab Emirates
(UAE) said its net profits in 1999 stood at 28.3 million dirhams
(7.7 million U.S. dollars), down by 53.3 percent from 606 million
dirhams (165 million dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The drop was mainly attributed to the company's declining
profits from selling its investments from 42.8 million dirhams (11.
7 million dollars) in 1998 to less than half million dirhams last
year, according to financial sources in the UAE.
</P>
<P>
Observers said the UAE stock market is currently undergoing
recession at the level of tradings while stock prices have
plummeted to its lowest level in three years.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The Turkish Government will speed up injecting 300
million U.S. dollars to the country's export and import bank under
an export expansion plan, Turkish Daily News reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish currency lira is likely to be overvalued against
foreign currencies in the first three to six months of the year
2000 due to the economic program, which could also affect Turkey's
exports.
</P>
<P>
The government last week drew up the plan for the first half of
the year and forecast a year-end export volume of 28.3 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Jordan is seeking to get 1.8 billion U.S. dollars
from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to carry out 28 economic
projects with a total cost of 2.8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
A Jordanian delegation, headed by Prince Faisal Bin Hussein and
comprising 70 senior businessmen, arrived in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday
for talks on money-raising. They will go to Dubai on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is here to attend the UAE-Jordanian forum for
business and investments, which opened Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The UAE's imports volume from Jordan rose from 310 million
dirhams (84.4 million U.S. dollars) in 1995 to 362 million dirhams
(98.6 million dollars) in 1997. The volume of re-exports from the
UAE to Jordan jumped during the same period from 61 million dirhams
(16.6 million dollars) to 154 million dirhams (41.9 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The balance of trade between the two countries posted a deficit
in favor of Jordan which amounted to 179 million dirhams (48.7
million dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The UAE is considered as one of Jordan's major Arab trading
partners.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey has launched a large scale of campaign in the
United States to attract American tourists, Turkish Daily News
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Numerous Ads will be put on U.S. newspapers and magazines as
well as the Internet. In New York, city buses will carry Turkey's
posters for two months. A free vacation in Turkey will be offered
to the winners of TV contests.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Iran Sign Memorandum of Understanding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- A Memorandum of Understanding
covering various aspects of relations between Iran and Turkey was
signed in Ankara on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The document was signed by visiting Iranian Foreign Minister
Kamal kharrazi and his Turkish counterpart Ismail Cem at the end of
their two rounds of talks in the Turkish Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the document shows the desire of the two big
Islamic neighbors to improve their lukewarm ties stemming from the
reciprocal withdrawal of ambassadors in 1997.
</P>
<P>
At an ensuing joint press conference, Kharrazi mentioned Iran's
concerns over the presence of Israel in the region.
</P>
<P>
"During our contacts, we said that we have the concerns that the
existence of Israel in the region has negative effects. We hope to
solve these problems through dialogues with Turkey," he said.
</P>
<P>
In response to a follow-up question, Cem called on all
countries, including Turkey's neighboring countries, to share
Turkey's approach to the issue.
</P>
<P>
He said it is out of the question for a foreign power such as
Israel to launch a hostile initiative from the territories of
Turkey against one of our neighbors.
</P>
<P>
However, Cem said, it is normal that neighboring countries may
have concerns in this respect, adding that the issue will be
examined if these countries bring their concerns to the agenda with
concrete documents.
</P>
<P>
In reply to a question concerning the alleged existence of the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) terrorists in Iran, Kharrazi
said that "I categorically deny the existence of PKK in our
territories."
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi arrived in Ankara Monday morning for a two-day visit
amid reports of intense exchange of accusations between the two
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
He was received Monday evening by Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit, who demanded that Iran not provide shelter for PKK
terrorists in its territories.
</P>
<P>
However, Ecevit said Turkey has never believed that Iran is
supporting the PKK, but he meant to say that the Iranian
authorities can do more to prevent PKK activities.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Iranian-Turkish gas pipeline deal, Ecevit
expressed thanks to Kharrazi for Iran's acceptance of Turkey's
proposal to postpone the gas supply until July 2001.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Explains Cause of Delay of Syrian-Israeli Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Tuesday that Syria and Israel postponed their peace talks because
they disputed over which comes first in their discussion on the
agenda.
</P>
<P>
"Basically what is happening now is that there is a delay
because each country has a different approach to how it wants its
major problems dealt with," Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
told a foreign policy forum.
</P>
<P>
"And, as might be expected, each one wants to have its needs
decided first. And what we are trying to do is to develop some
simultaneity and try to move the whole package forward," she said.
</P>
<P>
In the last week-long peace talks, winding up last Monday in
Shepherdstown, West Virginia, Syria and Israel were at odds over
which should be discussed first. Israel wanted to deal with the
topics of security and normalization of relations first while
Syria insisted on an Israeli pullout from the Golan Heights,
captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed at the end of the Shepherdstown talks last
Monday that they would resume their negotiations on Wednesday. But
the scheduled meeting broke down as the procedural dispute has
gone unsolved.
</P>
<P>
Albright said President Bill Clinton had telephoned Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad earlier in the day while she talked to
Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk al-Shareh.
</P>
<P>
"We just have to keep at it," she said of the Syrian-Israeli
talks. "It's very important."
</P>
<P>
With full-scale negotiations suspended, Syria and Israel will
each send two experts to Washington to try and whittle away at
their differences on how to reach a land-for-peace accord.
</P>
<P>
They will bring Syrian and Israeli responses to a U.S.-drafted
working document that is intended as a basis for an eventual
treaty.

MOSCOW, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian acting President, Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin will not leave Russia for a visit before
the presidential election scheduled for March 26, said a top
Kremlin official Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A visit to China will be the first trip abroad of a new Russian
president, Sergei Prikhodko, deputy chief of the Kremlin staff
told press after Putin's meeting with visiting vice chairman of
the Chinese Central Military Council, Defense Minister Chi Haotian
in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Prikhodko said that "in compliance with the existing practice
in Russia, prime minister and president do not leave the country
at the same time, and therefore it will be difficult for Vladimir
Putin" to make trips overseas before the upcoming general election.
</P>
<P>
"Besides, Vladimir Putin considers it necessary to concentrate
on complex issues of domestic policy of Russia," stressed the
president's aide.
</P>
<P>
He added that there was a broad program of events with the
participation of Vladimir Putin on the territory of Russia. "There
will be a lot of such affairs," he said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: United Nations Never Abandons Angola and People (by Gu Zhenqiu) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Security Council, which authorized the close-down of the U.
N. peacekeeping mission in Angola in February last year, kicked
the debate at a time when the humanitarian situation in the
African nation is "extremely alarming."
</P>
<P>
The debate, coupled with the world body's painstaking efforts
over past months, sends a strong signal to the international
community as a whole that the United Nations and the Security
Council, which has been attaching great importance to peace and
security in Africa since Kofi Annan began to head the world body
in 1997, never abandons Angola and its people.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General has reiterated that the United Nations
will not abandons the people of Angola and the Organization has
continued to provide humanitarian, human rights and development
assistance to the country," Kieran Prendergast, the U.N. under-
secretary-general, told the 15-nation Security Council Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Following the U.N. setback in the Angolan peace process, Annan
has reiterated the U.N. readiness to back efforts to seek a
peaceful settlement of the long-standing conflict, the longest on
the African continent. Consultations are underway with the Angolan
Government on the future U.N. presence and role in the African
country.
</P>
<P>
To give added impetus to the search for a political solution of
the conflict in Angola, Annan recently appointed the former
Nigerian permanent representative to the United Nations, Ibrahim
Gambari, as his special advisor on African issues and asked the
Nigerian ambassador to pay particular attention to Angola.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General looks forward to an early opportunity to
exchange views with the Government on the future role of the
United Nations in Angola, a role that would make it possible for
the Organization to make a meaningful contribution to the search
for lasting peace in the country and to the security and stability
of the region," Prendergast said.
</P>
<P>
After more than two years of vigorous efforts by the United
Nations, the rebel National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) failed to de-mobilize its forces and allow state
administration to be extended to areas under its control.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of fighting in December 1998 and the worsening
security situation in the country has led the Secretary-General to
conclude that the conditions for an effective United Nations role
had ceased to exist, and the Security Council terminated the U.N.
Mission, called MONUA, last February.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the United Nations has contributed to four years of
relative peace in Angola, the longest period of peace enjoyed by
the Angolan people. It is tragic that the unprecedented commitment
by the international community, and the unique opportunity it
provided Angola to achieve peace and reconciliation, was
repeatedly squandered.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, what prompted the U.N. chief to focus his
attention on Angola is the worsening humanitarian situation in the
country, which, as Annan put it, remained "extremely alarming."
</P>
<P>
"Following a major military offensive throughout the country in
recent months, the Angolan Government has gradually reestablished
its authority in areas formerly controlled by UNITA, including the
latter's strongholds in the central highlands," Annan said Monday
in his written report to the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"However, the humanitarian situation, which affects a growing
number of vulnerable people, remains extremely alarming," he said.
</P>
<P>
Out of Angola's total population of some 11 million, an
estimated 3.7 million Angolan civilians have been affected by the
conflict, including two million people who are internally
displaced.
</P>
<P>
Some 42 percent of Angolan children under five years of age are
either severely or modestly underweight and, if they survived,
were likely to develop health problems later. Besides, agriculture
production this year will not be satisfactory for the population.
</P>
<P>
The situation has been further aggravated by the spill-over of
the fighting into neighboring Zambia and Namibia, leading to an
influx of large numbers of Angola refugees on both sides of the
border areas.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the early operation of the U.N. Office in Angola is
the only way to push forward the peace process under the Lusaka
Protocol, signed in November 1994.
</P>
<P>
However, Angola, like other conflicts on the African continent,
has been long neglected by donor community as compared with war
victims in Kosovo, the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
Saying only a political solution can help restore durable peace
and security, he welcomed a recent indication by the Angolan
authorities that the Lusaka accord remained a valid basis for the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations maintains that there is no question that
UNITA bears the primary responsibility for the continued
humanitarian catastrophe in Angola. "I strongly urge UNITA to
demonstrate convincingly that it is prepared to fulfill its
commitments under the Lusaka Protocol and to seek genuine national
reconciliation," Annan added.

<HEADLINE> Delors Calls for Establishment of Federation of European States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an interview with Le Monde, the former Socialist president
of the EU executive body from 1985 to 1995 said that ``the project
of the fathers of Europe'' is ``washed down'' as EU now takes in
new members only by the criteria of the ``great common market.''
</P>
<P>
``Our historical task is to reunify Europe and thus open the
arms to the countries which are as European as us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He criticized EU for not considering candidate countries as``
actors,'' but as ``potential beneficiaries of the welfare of the
European space.''
</P>
<P>
``We are creating a feeling of frustration by requiring too
much from them...for entering the great common market. We should
at the same time keep the doors open, with more effective
political dialogue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Delors appealed to the EU to adopt a policy of ``avant-garde''
which goes further than the present one, confirmed by the Helsinki
summit earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
At the Helsinki summit, EU decided to begin taking in six
candidate countries in 2004.
</P>
<P>
Delors called the project of the summit ``a headlong rush into
the great common market.'' which would wash down the political
project of Europe.
</P>
<P>
``The essential question is whether Europeans want to play a
role in history,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked what effects a federation will have on European nations,
he said, ``I don't think the nations would be condemned to
disappear.''

<HEADLINE> World Bank Launches Market-Based Carbon Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank launched
Tuesday the Prototype Carbon Fund (PCF), the world's first market-
based mechanism to address climate change and promote the transfer
of finance and climate-friendly technology to developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"The PCF offers a tremendous opportunity to boost financial and
technology flows to developing countries at a time when government-
to-government transfers have fallen to historically low levels,"
said James D. Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to explore how market-based mechanisms such
as the PCF, involving the considerable financial muscle of the
private sector, can contribute to addressing the twin challenges
of climate change and sustainable development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Governments have recognized the seriousness of the threat of
climate change and during the 1990s negotiated the Framework
Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol. The protocol,
which guides implementation of the Convention, includes specific
emissions reductions targets for industrialized countries. It also
contains provisions allowing them some flexibility so they can
meet these commitments to reduce emissions in the most cost-
effective manner.
</P>
<P>
The PCF, established in the World Bank with contributions from
governments and private companies, is an ambitious first attempt
to experiment with the creation of a market in emissions
reductions under these "flexibility" provisions.
</P>
<P>
It will invest in cleaner technologies in developing countries
and transition economies, thus reducing their greenhouse gas
emissions. These emissions reductions will be independently
verified and certified, and then transferred to the fund's
contributors in the form of emissions reduction certificates
rather than cash.
</P>
<P>
So far, four governments and nine companies have approved
participation in the PCF, bringing the total of committed
contributions to 85 million U.S. dollars. The fund is capped at
150 million dollars, and plans to start operations in April 2000.
</P>
<P>
Governments that have approved participation in the PCF are
Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden.

<HEADLINE> Annan Concerned Over Iraq's Oil Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said on Monday that Iraq's oil production was likely to
drop unless Iraq could get the necessary spare parts and equipment
to upgrade its oil industry.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the United Nations Security Council, Annan said
"Unless applications for contracts for key items of oil spare
parts and equipment are approved expeditiously and are made
available and commissioned within a short time frame, the
production of oil is likely to drop."
</P>
<P>
Annan said he and oil experts hired by the United Nations
agreed with Iraq's request of 600 million U.S. dollars in spare
parts every six month, but only 300 million dollars are allowed.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief complained about the contracts of spare parts
and equipment which have been put on hold by the Security Council
sanctions committee, saying that as of January 13, the United
Nations had received 1,991 applications for oil spare parts and
equipment, worth 1.1 billion dollars, and some 1391 contracts with
a value of 721 million dollars had been circulated to the
committee.
</P>
<P>
 Iraq's oil exports during the current phase seven of the U.N.
oil-for-food programme were likely to slip by about 200,000
barrels a day if its current conditions of the oil facilities do
not get improved.
</P>
<P>
Annan has sent a group of oil experts to Iraq. They would
report to Annan on how and what steps the United Nations should
take next to improve Iraq's oil industry.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 18 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton on
Tuesday talks by phone with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad over
how to move Syrian-Israeli talks forward after the scheduled
meeting on Wednesday was postponed, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
"It was a useful discussion ... a good chance to review the
issues," White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said. "They discussed
where we are with the process and how we move forward from here."
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said President Clinton had pledged to do whatever is
necessary to bring Syria and Israel to an agreement. And the
White House tried to put the best face on the postponement, saying
some potholes on the road to a peace agreement were always
expected.
</P>
<P>
"We have always known that this was a difficult process
involving complicated issues and no one ever expected things to
run like clockwork or be without its fits and starts," Lockhart
said. "This is part of the process of fits and starts."
</P>
<P>
Syria and Israel will each send two experts to Washington this
week to discuss technical issues.
</P>
<P>
"We understand that these are difficult issues that have to be
worked out and it's hard. it's hart after so long to get to a
peace agreement that both sides can embrace," Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
"We made the judgment -- as the mediators here -- that now was
not the most important time to move forward, that move work needed
to be done, there's no point in having talks for talks' sake," he
added.

<P>
He said U.S. officials and the two parties would make judgments

<HEADLINE> DPRK, Korea to Join Fiat Car Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) and the Republic of Korea (Korea) are to combine
their forces in a car factory expected to assemble 10,000 Fiat
cars a year as of next year, Fiat officials confirmed Tuesday
after a report in the Korea Times.
</P>
<P>
To mark the symbolism of the project, the two protagonists, the
Korean Unification Church and the DPRK government-owned company,
Ryonbong, have decided to call the new company Peace Motors.
</P>
<P>
The Korea Times reported that the Unification Church plans to
sink 300 Million U.S. dollars in the project. Korea's ministry for
unification has so far approved only 6.66 million U.S. dollars of
the total, but can be expected to approve the rest in the future.
</P>
<P>
According to the Korea Times, the Unification Church created a
company called Pyonghwa Motors in April specifically for the joint
venture of which it holds 70 percent with the remaining 30 percent
held by Ryonbong.
</P>
<P>
The officials here said the new factory, to be built at Nampo
on DPRK's southwest coast, would supply domestic and foreign
markets.
</P>
<P>
They said it will only assemble finished parts supplied by Fiat,
also repairing and rebuilding cars, trucks and buses.
</P>
<P>
DPRK and Italy established diplomatic relations on January 4,
and the first ambassadors accredited in the two capitals are
expected to take up residence shortly.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 18 (Xinhua) -- South African faces a
tough task in alleviating poverty which affects millions of people
in the country despite a war on poverty waged three years ago, the

<TEXT>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 162.26 at 11,560.
72, falling from the record closing high of 11,722.98 points set
last Friday. The markets were closed Monday for the Martin Luther
King holiday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index fell 10.01 at 1,455.14 and the technology heavy Nasdaq
composite index rose 66.54 at 4,130.81, just shy of its peak of 4,
131.15 points, set on January 3.
</P>
<P>
The blue ship shares fell as the yield on the 30-year Treasury
bond rose to 6.74 percent today from 6.69 percent late Friday,
reaching the highest level since July 1997. The high rates scared
investors from the stock market.
</P>
<P>
Profit-taking also drove the Dow index lower. Investors sold
blue chip stocks to lock in profits from a strong rally last
Friday, which pushed the Dow to the record closing high of 11,722.
98 points.
</P>
<P>
Higher rates and profit-taking shifted investors' attention
from the strong corporate earnings. Pharmaceutical firm Pfizer and
financial service companies Citigroup and PaineWebber reported
strong profits in the final quarter of 1999 ,but Pfizer and
Citigroup finished with slight losses.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq index rallied after JDS Uniphase offered 15 billion
U.S. dollars to acquire E-Tek. The index was back above 4,000

LOS ANGELS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Internet users visited
over 30 portals, free email and entertainment sites in 15
countries outside the United States in November 1999, Media Metrix,
a U.S. leader in Internet and digital media measurement, reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
These countries include Australia, Brazil, the Czech Republic,
Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Russia,
Singapore, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. U.S. visitors to
foreign Web sites totaled more than 64 million during the month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the same month, a total of 7.8 million Internet
users in the United Kingdom, Germany and France also visited
portals, ISPs and e-commerce sites outside their own homeland in
countries throughout Europe and beyond.
</P>
<P>
The findings illustrate "what the 'worldwide' in World Wide Web
really means: access and interaction with diverse cultures and
languages throughout the world," Media Metrix said. The data also
show, the company added, unlike any other media, the Internet's
sheer size and its fragmented nature present great opportunities
for advertisers, marketers and retailers trying to reach the
largest, most demographically diverse audience possible.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Ask Congress for More Military Base Closures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We're going to ask for permission to do base closures again,"
Hamre said. "We still have excess infrastructure, ... and right
now the best process, the most fair process is the base closure
process."
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, Defense Secretary William Cohen
pressed for more base closings each year, but each time Congress
rejected it.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Cohen proposed separate rounds of base closings in
2001 and 2005. The Clinton administration will submit its 2001
budget proposal on February 7.
</P>
<P>
Many congressmen are unwilling to open the possibility of bases
being closed in their states, fearing a backlash at the ballot box
from voters who believe a lost military base means lost economic
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
The federal government has not said how many bases it thinks
should be closed, nor which would be targeted. That would be
decided by a congressionally authorized Base Realignment and
Closure Commission, subject to presidential approval. The Defense
Department lacks the authority to close bases on its own.

<HEADLINE> German Opposite CDU Holds Emergent Meeting Amid Donation Scandals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Christian Democratic Union (
CDU),major opposite party in German parliament, Tuesday held an
emergent meeting in Berlin amid the crises aroused by its secret
donations.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the party decided to back Wolfgang Schaeuble, the
CDU chairman who admitted last week to have accepted an undeclared
donation of 100,000 marks.
</P>
<P>
After the 7-hour meeting, some 60 CDU leaders from all over
Germany issued a statement rejecting calls for Schaeuble's
resignation.
</P>
<P>
The four-pointed statement also urged Helmut Kohl, former CDU
chairman and German chancellor, to reveal who had donated 2
million marks to his secret bank accounts, or to "leave his office
silently."
</P>
<P>
Kohl rejected the demand and announced to resign as honorary
CDU chairman later.
</P>
<P>
"The CDU is in one of the most serious crises in its history,"
the statement acknowledged. Angela Merkel, general secretary and
No.2 leader in the CDU,said the party should "learn much from Kohl.
"
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the meeting, Merkel said the party's decision on
Schaeuble would be discussed at the federal session in this April.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held following a series of scandals about CDU's
funding system.

MOSCOW, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Vice-chairman of the Chinese
Central Military Council, Defense Minister Chi Haotian and Russian
Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov discussed bilateral
cooperation and regional security here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They talked over Chinese-Russian military and diplomatic
cooperation in general, as well as a string of new bilateral
projects of cooperation in civil and military fields.
</P>
<P>
Klebanov confirmed Russia's stance on "recognition of Taiwan as
an indivisible part of the Chinese People's Republic and non-
recognition of Taiwan's sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
Chi Haotian reaffirmed that China sees Chechnya as a part of
the Russian Federation and the federal action in Chechnya as
Russia's internal affair.
</P>
<P>
Klebanov told reporters that the sides in particular agreed to
step up joint efforts in the field of civil aircraft building and
fuel and energy machine-building.
</P>
<P>
He said another line of the talks was China's possible
partnership in the civilian space project GLONASS.
</P>
<P>
The two officials agreed that "military-technical cooperation
between the two states is developing successfully."
</P>
<P>
Chi Haotian ended his trip in Russia and left Moscow Tuesday

<HEADLINE> Annan Concerned Over Iraq's Oil Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said on Tuesday that Iraq's oil production was likely
to drop unless Iraq could get the necessary spare parts and
equipment to upgrade its oil industry.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the United Nations Security Council, Annan said
"Unless applications for contracts for key items of oil spare
parts and equipment are approved expeditiously and are made
available and commissioned within a short time frame, the
production of oil is likely to drop."
</P>
<P>
Annan said he and oil experts hired by the United Nations
agreed with Iraq's request of 600 million U.S. dollars in spare
parts every six month, but only 300 million dollars are allowed.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief complained about the contracts of spare parts
and equipment which have been put on hold by the Security Council
sanctions committee, saying that as of January 13, the United
Nations had received 1,991 applications for oil spare parts and
equipment, worth 1.1 billion dollars, and some 1391 contracts with
a value of 721 million dollars had been circulated to the
committee.
</P>
<P>
 Iraq's oil exports during the current phase seven of the U.N.
oil-for-food programme were likely to slip by about 200,000
barrels a day if its current conditions of the oil facilities do
not get improved.
</P>
<P>
Annan has sent a group of oil experts to Iraq. They would
report to Annan on how and what steps the United Nations should
take next to improve Iraq's oil industry.

<HEADLINE> Italy's Life-sentenced Mafioso May Walk Free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of mafioso tried,
convicted and given life sentences for their parts in clan warfare
in the Italy's southern city of Reggio Calabria may walk free
because their terms of detention awaiting their appeals trial
could expire.
</P>
<P>
The alarm was sounded Tuesday by the head of the regional anti-
Mafia department, Salvo Boemi, after nearly 30 persons convicted
in Milan in April 1998 on Mafia charges and sentenced to one or
more life terms were released from custody January 14 because
their terms awaiting their appeals trials expired.
</P>
<P>
Boemi pointed out that there are only two courts of appeal in
the region and over the past five years, only 14 trials have been
handled by these benches compared to the 300 convictions and life
sentences handed down by lower courts.
</P>
<P>
The regional anti-Mafia chief pointed out that for Mafia crimes,
appeals trials must begin no later than 18 months after the
conclusion of the first trial, plus 90 days allowed for filing the
original sentences and findings.
</P>
<P>
The convictions, and sentences, do not become final until all
three degrees of the appeals process have been exhausted.
</P>
<P>
Among those tried and convicted and now coming to trial, said
Boemi,are the seasoned bosses and lieutenants of the Reggio
Calabria criminal organization of 'Ndrangheta and many of them not
now at large may be so at the end of investigations and lower
court trials which have lasted years.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Americans Urge to Return Cuban Boy to Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jose Serrano, a Democratic member of the House Representatives,
told reporters that Reno should send people to pick up the boy in
Florida and bring him to a U.S. military base and then send the
boy home in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, the leaders also condemned the
death threats and violence meant to silence what they called "the
average Cuban Americans" who tried to organize demonstrations to
support the boy's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
"I came today to support the Cuban Americans in this room and
around the nation who want the INS' to uphold its decision to
return Elian to what is quite clearly a loving family in Cuba who
miss this boy very much," said Re. Dr. Joan Brown Campbell,
outgoing General Secretary of the National Council of Churches.
</P>
<P>
Campbell, who recently went to Cuba and interviewed Elian's
father and grandparents there, told reporters that the boy's
father is a good and responsible father.
</P>
<P>
Delvis Fermandez Levy, President of the Cuban American Alliance,
an umbrella group of 36 Cuban-American organizations nationwide,
said one member of the group had been a target of attacks in Miami
by some who are using the boy as a political means to attack the
Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
In Miami, Florida, demonstrations were held last week to demand
Elian stay in the United States after the INS decided early this
month that the boy should be returned to his father in Cuba.
Dozens of demonstrators were arrested for violence.
</P>
<P>
On November 25 last year, Elian was rescued from sea near
Florida after his mother and stepfather died when their boat
capsized in an effort to immigrate to the United States illegally.
</P>
<P>
"I am here to tell you that the carefully choreographed
demonstrations you see in Miami do not represent the views of the
average Cuban-American living in the U.S.," Levy told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Those who have tried to organize peaceful demonstrations to
support the INS have received death threats and been otherwise
intimidated for simply trying to say the obvious, that Elian must
go home to heal his wounds, not go to Congress to testify or be
paraded around as a symbol for an anachronistic, angry mob in
Miami," he added.
</P>
<P>
House Representative Dan Burton, notorious for cosponsoring the
anti-Cuba Helms-Burton law, opposed the INS decision. He
subpoenaed Elian to appear before the Government Oversight and
Reform Committee that he chairs and to decide whether the boy
should stay in the U.S. or go home.
</P>
<P>
Burton and other two Cuban-American Representatives from
Florida are expected to push for a vote to make Elian a U.S.
citizen after Congress reconvenes January 24.
</P>
<P>
A congressional aid told Xinhua following the press conference
that Burton clearly violated the U.S. law in two ways. First, the
boy's father is the only person who can speak for him and secondly
Burton's committee has nothing to do with immigration issues.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-Cuban relations have been in tension since Cuban
leader Fidel Castro assumed power in 1959. The U.S. has
maintained an economic embargo against the Caribbean island for
the past decades.
</P>
<P>
Burton and other anti-Castro elements tried to use Elian as a
tool to launch a campaign against the Cuban government and the
little boy were traumatized both physically and mentally,
congressional sources say.
</P>
<P>
Even the Clinton administration which uphold a tough policy
against the Cuban government insists that the issue should be
resolved outside any political process.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Resigns as Honorary Chairman of German Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, January 18 (Xinhua)--Former German chancellor Helmut
Kohl Tuesday evening announced to resign as honorary chairman of
the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the major opposite party in
parliament.
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement, Kohl said he could not "break the promise
" to point out from whom he had received secret party donations.
</P>
<P>
" I should not break my promise to several people that had
financially supported my job in the CDU," he said, " and thus I
have decided to resign as honorary CDU chairman."
</P>
<P>
" I have served the party at deferent important positions for
40 years, and during this time I had also made mistakes that I had
acknowledged openly," he added.
</P>
<P>
Kohl was apparently under the pressure of Wolfgang Schaeuble,
his successor in CDU, and other party leaders.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this day, the CDU held an emergent meeting in Berlin to
discuss the crises aroused by Kohl's donation scandal.
</P>
<P>
Party leaders, standing behind Schaeuble, passed a declaration
saying Kohl should reveal the names of his donators, and before he
did so, Kohl should be suspended as honorary party chairman.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, who served as CDU chairman from 1973 to 1998 and German
Chancellor from 1982 to 1998, is facing a criminal investigation
by German federal prosecutors and a probe by a special
parliamentary committee.
</P>
<P>
He was named honorary party leader in 1998, when he resigned as
CDU chairman and handed the post to Schaeuble after the defeat in
general election.
</P>
<P>
Last December, Kohl admitted that he received up to 2 million
marks as undeclared party donations and ran secret bank accounts
in 1990s, offending Germany's Party Funding Law.
