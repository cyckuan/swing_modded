	   TOKYO (AP) _ A pair of Japanese satellites successfully docked
with one another Tuesday, the first ever such outer space maneuver
carried out via remote control from the earth, Japan's space agency
said.
	   The satellites _ nicknamed ``Orihime'' (Vega) and ``Hikoboshi''
(Altair) _ were hooked up before being launched into space last
November. On Tuesday, they were separated briefly at a maximum
distance of two meters (6.6 feet) and then rejoined.
	   The zero gravity rendezvous, carried out by technicians in
Japan, lasted about 15 minutes, said Yasuyuki Fukumuro, a spokesman
at Japan's National Space Development Agency.
	   The experiment was conducted at an altitude of 550 kilometers
(341 miles) above the Earth starting around 7:00 a.m. (2200 GMT
Monday), with signals transmitted from the earth and relayed by a
separate U.S.-made communications satellite, spokesman Fukumuro
said.
	   The rendezvous was carried out in anticipation of the need for
remote-controlled docking of supply shipments ferried my unmanned
spacecraft to the space stations of the future.
	   The satellites were named after two stars which cross each other
on the same day each year.
	   Tuesday's experiment was timed to coincide with Japan's
``Tanabata,'' or stars festival, which celebrates the legendary
meeting between a princess, Orihime, and her lover, Hikoboshi.
Though punished by the gods, the two were still allowed to meet
once a year on the night of July 7.
	   A second remote docking experiment is planned for around Aug. 7,
the agency said.
	   Technicians plan to stage a series of experiments with the
satellites, including one testing the use of a remote-controlled
robot arm. They were developed at a cost of 32 billion yen (dlrs
228 million).
	   The successful satellite rendezvous comes after Japan on
Saturday launched its first interplanetary spacecraft on a mission
to search for signs of water under the surface of Mars.

Pak brings badly needed boost to South Korean pride
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Red and yellow-colored banner morning
newspaper headlines Tuesday in South Korea proclaimed golfer Se Ri
Pak ``Our Hope, Our Encouragement.''
	   From President Kim Dae-jung to ordinary citizens who wouldn't
know a birdie from a bogey, South Koreans rejoiced Tuesday over
their countrywoman's triumph in the U.S. Women's Open golf
tournament.
	   With their once mighty economy in shambles, South Koreans badly
needed a boost to their national morale and pride _ and Pak
delivered.
	   Millions of Koreans stayed up through the night to watch on
television as the 20-year-old rookie won the championship _ and
their hearts.
	   ``With all the Korean people, I express my joy over your
victory,'' said President Kim Dae-jung in a congratulatory
telegram. He called her ``a hero of this era and our hope.''
	   ``I have never been so proud of being a Korean,'' Lee Sang-bae,
a Seoul businessman, said with a big smile.
	   ``She was the best news South Korea has had this year,'' the
national news agency Yonhap quoted South Korean ambassador to the
United States Lee Hong-koo as saying in Washington.
	   South Korea has had bad news galore since the country sought a
dlrs 58 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund in
December. The jobless rate has doubled. Thousands of businesses go
bankrupt each month. Suicides have increased by 37 percent to some
25 incidents a day.
	   Koreans seeking a morale boost in sports initially pinned their
hopes on the national soccer team's performance in the World Cup in
France. But the team's winless performance was a big
disappointment.
	   So millions of eyes turned to Pak. For weeks in advance,
television stations advertised her upcoming U.S. Open match. She
had won the McDonald's LPGA Championship in May, but many wondered
if that had been a fluke.
	   Pak proved it wasn't. She overcame a four-stroke deficit to beat
amateur Jenny Chuasiriporn in the first sudden death in the history
of the Women's Open.
	   Pak thus became the first rookie to win two LPGA majors since
1984.
	   ``It's amazing that she could handle such enormous pressure. She
played cool,'' said Kim Woon-yong, chairman of the Korean Sports
Council.
	   Probably the happiest supporter was the giant Samsung
conglomerate, Pak's corporate sponsor. It has hit a publicity
bonanza, with the news media dubbing Pak ``the most competitive
product South Korea has ever shipped abroad.''
	   As Pak's success grew, the Samsung logo on her hat and shirts
grew bigger as well.
	   On Tuesday, Samsung said it planned to launch a new sports wear
brand playing off her name, called ``SERIPAK.''

Junior turns boos to cheers and wins Derby
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM WITHERS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ Junior surprised fans at the All-Star Home Run
Derby, and so did Big Mac.
	   Ken Griffey Jr., the leading vote getter in fan balloting with
more than four million votes, had intended to pass up the glamour
event at this year's All-Star Game. But he changed his mind after
being booed during batting practice and was a last-second entrant
and winner.
	   ``I don't like to get booed,'' Griffey said. ``There were four
million reasons why I did it.''
	   And Mark McGwire, baseball's home-run leader, expected by many
to win the competition or at least dent the Coors Field scoreboard
in the mile-high (1.6-kilometer-high) altitude, hit just four
homers and failed to get beyond the first round.
	   ``I like the ball middle in, and the pitches were middle away,''
said McGwire, who did thrill the fans with a 510-footer (155-meter
shot) _ the longest of the day.
	   ``So, sorry everybody.''
	   Cleveland's Jim Thome, who choked last year in front of the
hometown fans at Jacobs Field by failing to hit one homer, finished
second to Griffey, who outhomered him in the final 3-2.
	   Early Monday afternoon, Griffey was insisting he would pass up
the chance to rocket balls through the thin Colorado air. He was
booed loudly the first time he was introduced and fans continued to
get on him during his batting practice swings.
	   But when his name was announced as the final AL entrant, he
received a warm ovation and by the time he walked to the plate for
his first round, many of the more than 50,000 were standing.
	   After connecting eight times to advance, he slowly walked back
to the AL dugout, tipped his cap to the fans and hugged his
4-year-old son, Trey.
	   Then it was McGwire's turn. He hit two weak grounders before
driving one over the wall in straightaway center, hitting a sign
just below the Rockpile section of seats. The announced estimated
distance of 510 feet (155 meters) surpassed the unofficial stadium
record, a 496-foot (151-meter) shot hit by Mike Piazza last year.
	   Thome, Baltimore's Rafael Palmeiro, Colorado's Vinny Castilla
and Houston's Moises Alou all finished the first round with seven
homers, but Alou was eliminated because he has less regular-season
homers than the others.
	   Atlanta's Javy Lopez and Seattle's Alex Rodriguez had five
homers each. Detroit's Damian Easley led off the event and managed
just two homers, one more than the Braves' Chipper Jones.
	   Griffey, the 1994 champion, spent more than an hour before the
event started defending his decision to skip it.
	   ``I made my decision a month ago,'' he said when asked if anyone
had tried to change his mind. ``Isn't this an invitation? Don't you
have the right to say that you want to do it or don't want to do
it?
	   ``It's not like they held a gun to my head and said, `you're
doing it.' They asked me, and I said no.''
	   Fortunately, McGwire didn't. In fact, McGwire has had a
difficult time saying no to anyone lately.
	   His pursuit of Maris' record is the talk of baseball, and
recently the Cardinals placed restrictions on the media in order to
give McGwire a break from the constant attention.
	   ``Well, I don't know if I'll ever enjoy it,'' McGwire said of
dealing with the press. ``That's just not me as a person. But I've
come to realize that I have to do something about it, and that I
have to talk about it.''
	   Talk that he belongs among the great home-run hitters in history
makes McGwire shake his head in disbelief.
	   ``It still blows me away, it really does,'' he said.
``Considering that when I was a kid, all I wanted to do was pitch.
It wasn't until my sophomore year in college that I turned into a
hitter, never knowing I'd get a chance to go to the big leagues.
	   ``The next thing you know, they're talking about my name along
with Babe Ruth, Maris, Mantle down the line. It's overwhelming. I
don't think it will really hit me until I'm retired.''

Griffey enters home run derby at last minute and wins it
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RICK GANO &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ Ken Griffey Jr. changed his mind Monday night. A
reluctant participant in the home run derby, he relented. And then
he won.
	   ``I don't like to get booed,'' Griffey said of the reaction he
received in batting practice because fans at Coors Field were upset
he wasn't going to participate in the home run derby.
	   After batting practice he decided to give it a try. And did he
ever.
	   He hit eight homers in the first round, eight more in the second
and then beat Cleveland's Jim Thome 3-2 in the final round. Some of
his homers were majestic, floating high into the thin air as if
they might never come down.
	   ``There are 4 million reasons why I did it,'' said Griffey, the
AL's top vote-getter with 4.2 million.
	   ``I usually get booed on the road, but this is the All-Star
game. I figured there'd be a few boos but not like that. The fans
wanted me in the home run competition, so I did it. I didn't expect
to win it.''
	   Griffey couldn't understand all the fuss over his initial
refusal to compete.
	   ``You tell me what is the big deal,'' he said earlier Monday.
	   ``Michael Jordan didn't do the slam dunk competition and he
didn't catch as much flak as I have.
	   ``Now you got people writing that I'm a high-priced, spoiled
brat and a punk. What am I supposed to do?''
	   Even a shorter haircut _ prompting one inquisitor to compare it
to teammate Jay Buhner's very bald look _ brought Griffey unwanted
attention Monday.
	   ``I can't even get a haircut without people asking me about it.
The next thing they'll want to know is what kind of toilet paper I
use,'' he said.
	   The fans apparently liked him. They gave him more votes than any
American League player. But when he received his award during
workouts Monday and while he took batting practice, the fans let
him know they didn't like his decision.
	   When he was introduced with the other home run derby
contestants, just before Mark McGwire, he received polite applause.
	   Earlier in the day as soft drink representatives lavished praise
on him and complimented his smile _ projecting that Griffey could
play another 15 years _ the Seattle Mariners star looked anything
but happy.
	   ``I don't know about the 15 more years,'' he said. ``Makes me
about 43.''
	   All day Griffey had to explain why he didn't want to participate
in the home run derby with McGwire, the man he trails 37-35 in the
real numbers. Then he surprised everyone by entering.
	   ``Isn't this an invitation?'' he asked. ``Don't you have the
right to say you don't want to do it. They don't hold a gun to your
head and say, `you're doing it.' I said a month ago I wasn't going
to.''
	   Griffey's reasoning for initially not wanting to participate had
to do with travel.
	   Seattle is located far from other major league cities, and
Griffey also had to play in a Sunday night game against Texas.
	   ``We flew 70,000 miles (112,650 kilometers) last year and our
closest trip is 2 1/2 hours,'' he said. ``Last year I flew seven
hours to get to a press conference at nine o'clock. The home run
competition didn't start until four. By four, I was just worn out.
This year, I just said, `I can't do it.'''
	   As far as chasing McGwire or staying ahead of Chicago's Sammy
Sosa or catching Roger Maris, Griffey isn't really interested. He
respects the record but doesn't let it consume him.
	   ``I don't like to talk about myself,'' said Griffey, who at age
28 has been selected to nine All-Star teams. ``It's tough for me to
sit down and say, `You know, I've done this, I've done that.'''
	   Seattle and All-Star teammate Alex Rodriguez said the pressure
isn't getting to Griffey, even if the persistent questions are
tiring.
	   ``He handles it well. He takes everything in stride and doesn't
let anything bother him,'' Rodriguez said.
	   ``We so often hear about guys getting paid and not putting up
numbers. This guy gets paid and puts up the numbers every year.''
	   If Griffey's countenance is a bit altered, the Mariners'
last-place standing has something to do with it.
	   ``I don't think people look happy when they are losing games,
when you are winning that's the only way you can smile and be
yourself,'' he said.
	   ``If you smile when you are getting your butt kicked, people
look at you a little differently and say, `He ain't taking this
game seriously.' And that's not the case. I have fun. I just can't
show it as much on the field.''

Report: Exports of vegetables, fish land in garbage at new airport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Export consignments of vegetables,
fish and even tortoises are being thrown into a garbage dump
because the city's new airport is overwhelmed by cargo, a newspaper
reported Tuesday.
	   Trucks loaded with food items, rotting after several days of
delay at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport, drive to a garbage
dump from the cargo terminal each day, Sun daily said.
	   The newspaper published a picture of dead fish and tortoises at
the dump, which is near the airport's cargo area.
	   On Saturday, Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik said the Malaysia
Airlines cargo center would temporarily stop accepting perishable
goods until the cargo could be handled faster.
	   The newspaper did not give any estimate of the amount of goods
that perish each day, but said four trucks that can each carry up
to 13 tons of waste ``have been making five to six trips daily.''
	   Airport officials could not be immediately reached for comment.
	   Massive systems failures and teething troubles at the dlrs 2.3
billion airport have caused lengthy flight delays and long waits
for baggage, cargo and taxis since the airport opened to traffic on
June 29. Most flights, however, operated on schedule over the
weekend.
	   Some airlines have complained about losses incurred because of
the delays at the airport.
	   The five-level facility boasts the world's tallest air-traffic
control tower, biggest passenger lounge and the capacity to handle
25 million passengers a year.

Top-seeded Magnus Gustafsson advances to second round

<TEXT>
	   BASTAD, Sweden (AP) _ Top-seeded Magnus Gustafsson of Sweden
routed fellow-countryman Fredrik Johnsson 6-3, 6-1 in opening play
Monday of the Swedish Open ATP tennis tournament.
	   Gustafsson, chasing his fourth Swedish Open title, will play
Markus Hipfl, a qualifier from Austria, in the second round. Hipfl
beat Andreas Vinciguerra, a promising youngster from Sweden who
earlier this year advanced to the semifinal of the Australian Open
junior tournament, 6-2, 1-6, 7-6 (7-5).
	   Gustafsson, who also won here in 1991, 1992 and 1996, became the
top seed after czech Karol Kucera, twelfth in the ATP ranking,
withdrew last week due to a sprained ankle. If the seasoned
claycourt player, now ranked 26th, wins again here he will be one
up on fellow Swedes Bjorn Borg and Mats Wilander, the only other
players with three titles.
	   Also through to the second round was talented 18-year old
Russian player Marat Safin. He upset Andre Agassi, title defender
Gustavo Kuerten and Daniel Vacak before he was eliminated in the
fourth round of the French Open earlier this year by local hero
Cedric Pioline.
	   Safin, who received a wild card for this tournament, beat Jared
Palmer of the U.S., a late replacement for German Marc Kevin
Goellner, 6-3, 7-5. Goellner withdrew because of an injury.
	   Three other seeds moved into the second round. Fifth-seeded
Richard Fromberg of Australia outlasted Javier Sanchez of Spain
6-1, 6-2, sixth-seeded Thomas Johansson beat Arnaud Clement of
France, 7-5, 6-1 and seventh-seeded Dominik Hrbaty of Slovakia
overcame Jordi Burillo of Spain, who retired after 6-3, 1-1.
	   In other action Spaniard Juan Antonio Marin defeated Arnaud di
Pasquale of France 4-6, 7-6 (7-3), 6-4.

Wealthier countries must aid Asia's recovery: IMF director

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Japanese comment, details on euro, developing
countries asking not to be forgotten. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Wealthier countries must support Japan and
other Asian nations by granting new loans and humanitarian aid or
restructuring existing loans, the head of the International
Monetary Fund said.
	   The comments by IMF managing director Michel Camdessus came as
leaders of world economic institutions gathered Monday at the U.N.
Economic and Social Council's annual session. Leaders reiterated
calls for Japan to shore up its banking system and enact strong
economic reforms.
	   Developing countries, such as Benin and Swaziland, pressed
Camdessus and World Bank President James Wolfensohn to remember
that Asian countries are not alone in facing economic turmoil.
	   And European countries asked for reassurance that the Asian
financial crisis wouldn't harm their plans for a common currency.
Camdessus replied that he expected the turmoil would be well behind
by the time the euro is introduced.
	   In addition to urging wealthier countries to help in bail out
Asia's troubled economies, Camdessus called on the affected
countries themselves to improve their own financial management and
preserve the stability of exchange rates.
	   The session was to begin considering the findings of the U.N.
World Economic and Social Survey 1998, which projected that growth
in the dollar value of world exports would fall to about 2.5
percent in 1998 from 2.7 percent last year and 4.3 percent in 1996.
	   The Asian crisis plunged several of the fastest-growing
economies into a severe recession and slowed growth of world output
and trade, the report says.
	   Japan's U.N. representative, Wataru Nishigahiro, said the
government was undertaking several measures to improve Japan's
``economic difficulties.''
	   ``The government of Japan basically recognizes the coordination
to the present Japanese economic situation and the Southeast Asia
financial crisis to a certain extent,'' he said.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan opened the session by noting
that the financial turmoil hasn't only affected South Asia, but
countries as far away as Africa, in the form of reduced commodity
prices.
	   ``The crisis has had its most devastating impact on society's
margins: on the poor and vulnerable who are least able to withstand
the sudden loss of jobs,'' said Annan. He called for relief from
debt for poor countries, more humanitarian aid and duty-free
exports for the least-developed countries.

Stiff entry fee capsizes 14 Around Alone skippers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHARLESTON, South Carolina (AP) _ Many sailors would say the
toughest part of the Around Alone race is coming up with the dlrs
12,500 entry fee.
	   Faced with a July 1 deadline, 14 skippers dropped out. That
leaves 25 to compete in the upcoming event, formerly called the BOC
Challenge.
	   Neal Petersen made the deadline, but it wasn't easy. He's been
working more than 15 hours a day, seven days a week for months to
find sponsors.
	   ``Compared to all the behind-the-scenes work we do, the sailing
is actually going to be a reward,'' said Petersen.
	   Another Charleston-based sailor, Robin Davie, has received more
than dlrs 3,000 from two local schools.
	   Around Alone starts here Sept. 26. For nine months, skippers
sail alone, heading first to Africa and then to New Zealand. The
fleet dips into the frigid Southern Ocean before rounding
treacherous Cape Horn and then heading north back to Charleston.
	   The skippers are a mix of professional sailors and low-budget
dreamers.
	   Among the former are Isabelle Autissier, a French sailor who has
had the backing of large French corporations, and Giovanni Soldini,
a respected Italian skipper who has one of the most advanced
60-foot (18-meter) yachts in the world.
	   Then there are entrants like Minoru Saito, a Japanese sailor
with a history of heart problems, and Bob Adams and Viktor Yazykov.
	   Adams, an American, and Yazykov, a Russian, teamed up to build
two identical yachts in a Russian shipyard. They call their
campaign the ``Wind of Change Challenge.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   The entries include: Class 1 (60-foot (18-meter) yachts) _
Isabelle Autissier, France; Albert Bargues, Spain; Richard Bate,
South Africa; Mike Golding, United Kingdom; Josh Hall, UK; Fedor
Konioukhov, Russia; Sebastian Reidl, Canada; Giovanni Soldini,

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Business tycoon Eduardo Cojuangco
Jr., a close ally of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, was
reappointed Tuesday as chairman of San Miguel Corp., 12 years after
he was booted out of the Philippines' largest food and beverage
conglomerate.
	   Cojuangco had been forced to leave San Miguel in 1986 after
Marcos' ouster in a ``people power'' revolt, and his shares in the
company were seized by the government.
	   His return came a week after newly elected President Joseph
Estrada, a former Marcos supporter, assumed office. Cojuangco is
now a leader of Estrada's Struggle of the Filipino Masses party.
	   However, an ally of Cojuangco on the San Miguel board strongly
rejected suggestions that Estrada exerted political pressure to
have Cojuangco elected.
	   ``What has happened ... was not because of Mr. Estrada,'' said
Estelito Mendoza, a San Miguel board member who is also a lawyer
for Cojuangco.
	   Mendoza, speaking to journalists, gave little indication of
Cojuangco's plans for San Miguel, merely saying: ``We will review
the situation of the company.''
	   The company's former chairman, Andres Soriano III, and five
other board members stepped down July 2 to give way to a new
management.
	   Of the nine remaining board members, eight voted for Cojuangco
at a special board meeting Tuesday. One board member, a government
representative, was absent.
	   Cojuangco was not present at the meeting, but was scheduled to
assume the chairmanship on Wednesday.
	   Cojuangco has been strongly critical of Soriano's efforts to
expand San Miguel overseas.
	   Under the first decade of Soriano's chairmanship, San Miguel's
profits grew, but earnings have came under pressure since 1996 from
the cost of expanding brewing operations in Asia.
	   Cojuangco's appointment is expected to speed the resolution of
an arduous ownership battle over San Miguel's shares, 47 percent of
which were impounded by the government after the 1986 revolt
because of allegations they were illegally acquired by Marcos'
allies.
	   The shares consist of Cojuangco's 20 percent stake, estimated to
be worth 23 billion pesos (dlrs 561 million), and a 27 percent
share held by the government-sequestered United Coconut Planters
Bank's, which was controlled by Cojuangco under Marcos.
	   Prior to the announcement, San Miguel's shares were flat in
early trading. The news of Cojuangco's takeover caused share prices
to dip slightly.

Senate enters final debate on bill to limit Aboriginal land rights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Aborigines and the opposition mounted
a last-ditch campaign Tuesday to kill a Senate bill to limit
Aboriginal land claims, saying it would wipe out their fishing
rights in coastal waters.
	   In a ruling that extended the concept of native title, a Federal
Court in Darwin ruled Monday that Aborigines from Croker Island off
northern Australia have communal rights over the sea and seabed.
	   Justice Howard Olney said Aborigines from five clans had limited
rights in relation to the sea and seabed in an area of about 1,000
square miles (1,600 sq. kms) north of the Coburg Peninsula.
	   But the judge said the rights are not exclusive and that anglers
and commercial fishermen can use the waters.
	   The Croker Island claim is considered a test case for at least
120 claims to sea area over thousands of square miles (kilometers)
off Australia's coast, including prime fishing and resort areas.
	   The ruling came during the final stages of Senate debate on a
government-sponsored bill to limit Aboriginal claims on some 42
percent of Australia, which is leased by the government to
ranchers, farmers and miners.
	   One of the provisions of the government's bill is that
Aborigines should have no right to make claims on air space or
waters.
	   Aborigines, and the opposition Labor Party and Democrats argued
Tuesday that passage of the bill would negate the gains made by the
Croker Island Aborigines in the courts.
	   Aborigines called for major amendments to the bill, saying the
legislation would wipe out the Croker Island ruling.
	   ``That's one of the areas of extinguishment the Democrats are
very disappointed with,'' Democrat Sen. Meg Lees said Tuesday.
	   But the government says the finding has no implications for its
bill.
	   Special Minister of State Nick Minchin said the bill already
provided a mechanism for the recognition and protection of native
title offshore, with compensation payable for its impairment or
extinguishment.
	   A final vote on the bill may not come until later this week,
with the Senate laboriously wading through a raft of amendments as
part of the native title changes.
	   The controversial bill is back in the Senate for the third time
after Prime Minister John Howard struck a compromise deal with
independent Sen. Brian Harradine.
	   Howard had threatened months ago to dissolve Parliament and go
to a general election to resolve the issue after the Senate twice
defeated his bill.
	   But this month, as the third and final attempt to pass the bill
loomed, Howard regretted that pledge as his government's popularity
sank to 34 percent in the polls, the lowest since it was elected in
1996, far behind the Labor Party's popularity.
	   Harradine, who had voted against the bill twice before, won some
concessions to Aborigines in a new amended version and has pledged
to support the bill.
	   The government is one vote short of a majority in the Senate, so
Harradine's vote is essential to passing the bill.
	   In 1992, the Mabo case in the High Court established Aborigines'
common law right to claim native title to vacant government lands.
	   The case reversed a previous legal fiction called ``terra
nullius,'' which held that Australia was an empty land when the
first white settlers arrived in 1788.
	   In 1996, the High Court said in the Wik case that Aborigines
could have the right of access for religious and cultural
ceremonies to the vast lands that the government leases long term
to ranchers, farmers and miners, which cover some 42 percent of
Australia.

Puerto Ricans brace for biggest strike in decades

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Fearing their biggest strike in
decades, shopkeepers barred windows with steel shutters, riot
police guarded ports and power plants and islanders stocked up on
ice, water and flashlight batteries.
	   ``You'd think we were preparing for a hurricane,'' one shopper
said, her arms crammed with candles and water bottles in a
supermarket that ran out of carts and baskets.
	   Union leaders expect up to half a million of Puerto Rico's 3.8
million people to join a 48-hour general strike starting Tuesday to
protest the sale of the state telephone company. Most are
government employees, including utility and health workers.
	   The strike was called to support 6,400 telephone workers who
stopped working June 18 and are accused of slashing telephone lines
that left more than 250,000 islanders without long-distance service
Monday.
	   ``Put your names on the list for picket line or special missions
starting at 3 a.m.,'' strike leaders told employees Monday outside
the Puerto Rico Telephone Co. headquarters. They refused to say
what the ``special missions'' entailed.
	   Riot police, firefighters and civil defense workers went on
alert Monday. Last week, a bomb hidden in a flashlight exploded in
a policeman's hands, blowing off a finger. A firebomb slightly
damaged an electric pylon.
	   Hundreds of tourists have canceled vacations, hotels reported.
At least one airline, Antigua-based LIAT, canceled flights.
	   Protesters have made a rash of telephone bomb threats and
planted hoax bombs, prompting major shopping malls to announce
Monday they would close during the strike.
	   About 4,000 airport workers vowed to walk off the job. Port
Authority director Hector Rivera said his 134 managers would keep
ports open, including the San Juan international airport that
averages 300 flights a day.
	   While telephone workers are afraid they will lose their jobs,
the sale has much wider implications as the most ambitious plan yet
from Gov. Pedro Rossello, who has sold state enterprises from
hospitals and prisons to ports and hotels.
	   Independent-minded leaders of the biggest unions, which belong
to government workers, see their power waning and accuse the
pro-statehood Rossello of ``selling the patrimony of the people''
to a U.S. company.
	   Rossello last week signed a law completing the dlrs 1.9 billion
sale to a consortium led by U.S. communications giant GTE Corp. and
the local Banco Popular. It awaits approval by the Federal
Communications Commission.
	   The bank, which lost dlrs 140 million in labor union accounts
last week, announced it was closing for the strike. Last week,
gunmen strafed one San Juan branch, and protesters planted the bomb
that mutilated the police officer at another.
	   Annie Cruz, president of one of two telephone workers' unions,
said she hoped the general strike would persuade the government to
hold a referendum on the sale. It would cost dlrs 25 million to
abandon the deal.
	   It would be the first general strike in Puerto Rico since tens
of thousands of sugar cane cutters stopped working in 1934 to
demand better conditions.
	   Former Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon tried to sell the telephone
company in 1990 but was dissuaded by massive protests.
	   Last October, unions called a 24-hour work stoppage against the
sale.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ A pair of Japanese satellites successfully docked
with one another Tuesday, the first ever such outer space maneuver
carried out via remote control from Earth, Japan's space agency
said.
	   The satellites _ nicknamed ``Orihime'' (Vega) and ``Hikoboshi''
(Altair) _ were hooked up before being launched into space last
November. On Tuesday, they were separated briefly at a maximum
distance of two meters (6.6 feet) and then rejoined.
	   The zero gravity rendezvous, carried out by technicians in
Japan, lasted about 15 minutes, said Yasuyuki Fukumuro, a spokesman
at Japan's National Space Development Agency.
	   The experiment was conducted at an altitude of 550 kilometers
(341 miles) above the Earth starting around 7:00 a.m. (2200 GMT
Monday), with signals transmitted from Earth and relayed by a
separate U.S.-made communications satellite, spokesman Fukumuro
said.
	   The rendezvous was carried out in anticipation of the need for
remote-controlled docking of supply shipments ferried by unmanned
spacecraft to the space stations of the future.
	   Japan is spending 310 billion yen (dlrs 2.2 billion) to build
four modules for the International Space Station, a joint project
with the United States, Russia and the European Space Agency
scheduled for completion in 2003.
	   A separate institute runs Japan's space science programs, such
as the ``Nozomi'' probe that lifted off on Saturday to explore the
planet Mars.
	   The Institute of Space and Astronautical Science also plans to
send a probe to the Moon next year and to explore a nearby asteroid
early in the next millennium.
	   The two satellites that docked Tuesday were named after two
stars which cross each other on the same day each year.
	   The rendezvous was timed to coincide with Japan's ``Tanabata,''
or stars festival, which celebrates the legendary meeting between a
princess, Orihime, and her lover, Hikoboshi. Though punished by the
gods, the two were still allowed to meet once a year on the night
of July 7.
	   A second remote docking experiment is planned for around Aug. 7,
the agency said.
	   Technicians plan to stage a series of experiments with the
satellites, including one testing the use of a remote-controlled
robot arm. They were developed at a cost of 32 billion yen (dlrs
228 million).

Singapore's Goh: Recession likely next year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JONATHAN DRAKE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ As the Asian crisis continues to hurt its
vulnerable economy, Singapore's prime minister said Tuesday his
country will probably slide into recession next year.
	   Although a contraction this year was not expected, Goh Chok Tong
told reporters that ``for next year, the possibility of a recession
is fairly high.''
	   Speaking after launching a history exhibition, the Singapore
leader said his country should be able to avoid overall negative
growth this year ``unless things go terribly wrong in the last
quarter.''
	   Last week, Singapore unveiled wide-ranging economic measures to
cushion the economy as growth continues to dwindle, and revised its
economic forecasts downward for the year.
	   The off-budget package, worth 2 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs
1.17 billion), was to help business cope with the economic
downturn, and will produce Singapore's first budget deficit in over
a decade.
	   The government also announced a reduced growth estimate for the
year of 0.5 to 1.5 percent, much lower than its previously
optimistic forecast but still above many private economists'
predictions for mild recession.
	   Based on performance in the first two quarters, the new forecast
meant the government was expecting a mild, technical recession in
the last half of the year. Initial figures for the second quarter
show growth slackening to 1.9 percent, while first quarter growth
stood at 5.9 percent.
	   The government added then that further action could be taken if
the situation worsens.
	   While opening the history exhibit on Tuesday, Goh said the
ongoing Asian crisis is ``a timely reminder that challenges can
arise unexpectedly,'' adding that the country is ``bracing itself
for tough times ahead.''

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - After Jakarta's governor flip-flopped
on a decree and ordered bicycle rickshaws out of the capital, their
drivers fought back Tuesday with a now-familiar tactic. They
demonstrated.
	   In keeping with Indonesia's new protest trend, hundreds of
pedicab owners parked their colorful contraptions outside Gov.
Sutiyoso's office to protest his decision to ban their livelihood.
	   After an hour or two of slogan-shouting and waving of the red
and white Indonesian flag, they hopped back on the three-wheeled
pedicabs and drove off, merrily flouting a law barring them from
main thoroughfares.
	   With a relentless economic crisis stripping people of their jobs
all over Indonesia, Sutiyoso had lifted a decade-old ban on
pedicabs to try to generate employment. Then, last week, he banned
them again under pressure from city councilors.
	   Undeterred, the rickshaw drivers staged a rally in another sign
that many people in the nation of 200 million feel the only way to
voice their opinions or grievances is on the street.
	   Protests of all sorts, many tied to Indonesia's economic
hardship, have flourished since student activists helped oust
President Suharto in May after 32 years of authoritarian rule.
	   ``These are hard times for everybody,'' said Hasan Riyadi, a
38-year-old pedicab driver who says he can't find another job.
	   Acknowledging the show of opposition, city officials in brown
uniforms ventured out of the governor's pillared mansion to tell
the drivers they could work, at least temporarily.
	   Pedicabs were banned by councilors in the capital of 10 million
in the late 1980s as degrading to their drivers and a hazard on
already traffic-choked streets.
	   Called ``becaks'' (pronounced BEH'-chaks) in Indonesian, they
still ply the streets of many Indonesian cities and are common in
India and parts of Southeast Asia.
	   Pedicabs are popular because a ride costs less than motorized
alternatives and they maneuver with ease through the narrow,
winding alleys of many Jakarta neighborhoods.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Minor glitches plagued Hong Kong's new, dlrs 20
billion showcase airport Tuesday amid mixed reviews over its first
day of operation.
	   Computer glitches continued to cause some flight delays at Chek
Lap Kok airport, but their number and how many passengers were
affected wasn't known.
	   ``The computer went down and lost track of some flight
information,'' said Chris Donnolly, an Airport Authority spokesman.
	   The computer problems also caused delays in baggage-handling and
flight information displays, he said.
	   The new airport built on reclaimed land on a remote outlying
island Monday replaced venerable Kai Tak airport, famous for its
roof-skimming approaches over congested urban areas.
	   Airport officials dismissed allegations of planning errors and
said minor problems were expected in the early days of operation.
About 80,000 passengers and 220 flights used the airport on Monday.
Another 100,000 residents visited the futuristic airport, Donnolly
said.
	   ``No matter how many trials you do, you can't duplicate the
effect of 70,000 to 80,000 people just coming day after day after
day with a very short respite during a brief overnight period,''
Clinton Leeks, the authority's corporate development director, said
on Radio Hong Kong.
	   Raymond Ch'ien, an advisor to Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa,
told Radio Hong Kong that the problems were not ``any serious
system flaws,'' and said officials should take a look only if the
problems were not solved in a few weeks.
	   ``You only have to have one or two bugs and they are enough to
cause problems,'' Donnolly said.
	   The mass-circulation Apple Daily reported that authority
chairman Wong Po-yan offered an apology for passengers affected by
the problems on an evening TV program Monday. Donnolly said airport
officials were to meet later Tuesday to find ways to fix the
problems.
	   Newspapers reported Tuesday that some passengers had to wait
four hours in the departure hall with little information provided.
	   Some passengers also waited for two hours inside planes before
they could disembark because there were not enough staff and tarmac
buses, while others waited for hours Monday evening for their
baggage, the papers reported.
	   Compared to the rocky start of another new Asian airport in
Kuala Lumpur, the problems here appeared minor and did not affect
the airport's general operation.
	   ``Even when we move house, we encounter many trivial problems
that cause inconvenience, let alone such a massive operation as
moving the airport,'' Apple Daily editorialized Tuesday.
	   Ming Pao, another Chinese daily, said the authority has the
responsibility to explained to passengers the problems, although
certain ``problems are inevitable.'' It said ``we can't jump to a
conclusion and blame the authority for inadequate planning.''
	   Oriental Daily News said the problems showed that the airport
wasn't ready for operation. ``People's safety is at stake. The
transition between the old and new airport should have been
perfect,'' it said.

Taiwanese airline negotiating for stake in Air Philippines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A Taiwanese airline is seeking to
acquire a substantial stake in Air Philippines, a domestic carrier
which hopes to cash in on the troubles besetting flag carrier
Philippine Airlines, an official said Tuesday.
	   Taiwan's U-land Airlines is considering up to a 40 percent
stake, the maximum allowed for a foreign company, to help Air
Philippines finance an expansion and refleeting plan, said Cristina
Mojica, senior vice president of the Philippine carrier.
	   The talks between the two airlines have reached the ``due
diligence stage,'' in which both sides examine the financial status
of the other, she said.
	   ``We're sizing each other up,'' Mojica said.
	   Air Philippines, which began business in 1996, is one of several
local carriers that entered the market after the government
deregulated the airline industry in the early 1990s. It is
controlled by Chinese-Filipino businessman William Gathalian.
	   U-land flies on Asian routes, complementing Air Philippines'
plans to expand outside the Philippines, Mojica said.
	   Air Philippines plans to begin flights to Taiwan later this year
and has applied for government permission to fly to South Korea and
Singapore, she said.
	   The airline, which currently has six Boeing 737-200s and two
Japanese-made YS-11s, concluded an agreement early this year to
lease three McDonnell-Douglas MD-88 planes from U-land.
	   Mojica said their passenger load has increased by more than 20
percent since the start of a strike by pilots at Philippine
Airlines last month. The 22-day strike forced PAL to slash its
flights by about 80 percent and brought Asia's oldest airline to
the brink of closure.

Thai rice millers resume work as foreign workers reprieved
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Thai government has agreed to allow
foreign laborers to work in rice mills for one more month, bowing
to mill owners who shut down operations to protest a law demanding
the foreigners be replaced by Thais.
	   The agreement was reached after urgent talks Monday to find a
solution between the demands of the owners, who say Thais will not
take the backbreaking, minimum-wage jobs, and the government,
coping with rising unemployment due to Thailand's recession.
	   Bumrung Kritchpakorn, honorary president of the Thai Rice Mills
Association, told Dow Jones Newswires on Tuesday that the 400 rice
mills that took part in the stoppage will now resume buying rice
from farmers.
	   The mills shut down last week in protest of a law to send home
300,000 foreign workers to free up jobs for Thais. The owners said
that their efforts to replace the 20,000 foreigners in Thai mills,
mostly coming from impoverished Myanmar, had been fruitless.
	   The government of Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai has said more
Thais might be interested if the 100-kilogram (220-pound) sacks of
rice the laborers lug around each day were reduced to 55 kilograms
(120 pounds). Some workers carry 300 of the heavy sacks a day.
	   The government has been reluctant to grant an exemption allowing
all foreign workers to stay, as was the case for another industry
unpopular with Thais, fishing. The mill owners have already had the
original May 1 deadline extended twice.
	   The one-month reprieve will get the mills back in operation and
give the government and industry time to come up with a permanent
solution. Thailand is the world's number-one rice exporter.

Cambodian monk defrocked for affair
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A Buddhist monk has been defrocked
as punishment for having an affair with a widowed cigarette vendor,
a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   Yong Polak, 27, was expelled from the clergy after the woman,
described as a 45-year-old mother of six, was spotted entering his
room at the Wat Srah Chok pagoda in Phnom Penh over the weekend.
	   The Cambodia Daily reported that the suspicions of other monks
were raised when the light went off in Yong Polak's room and the
woman did not reappear. Police were notified and raided the room.
	   The Buddhist patriarch, Non Nget, decided to defrock the monk
for violating precepts of celibacy and for harming the credibility
of the monastery.

Chinese police, in first, use lie detector to break murder case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Investigators solved a murder case by forcing a
suspect to take a lie detector test in China's first successful use
of the devices, the official Guangming Daily reported Tuesday.
	   Police in the southwestern city of Kunming found statements by a
suspect to be inconsistent with the murder scene and got permission
from the local Intermediate People's Court to use a lie detector,
the newspaper said.
	   The lie detector showed that the suspect and another man police
were searching for were ``homosexual friends'' and the two had
wrecked the murder scene to confuse investigators, Guangming Daily
said.
	   With those results, investigators refocused their efforts and
solved the murder. The two suspects were ``punished severely,'' the
newspaper said. It gave no further details on the murder or the
suspects and said the case occurred ``recently.''
	   The Kunming Intermediate People's Court is a testing center for
judicial reform in China. Two years ago, it began experimenting
with using lethal injections, instead of firing squads, in
court-ordered executions of criminals.
	   Guangming Daily said the court began considering lie detectors
last year and looked at German and U.S. models. An American device
was used to solve the murder case, the newspaper said.

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA , Bangladesh (AP) _ Flash floods claimed six lives and
marooned more than 500,000 people in southern Bangladesh, an
official said Tuesday.
	   Monday's flash flood cut off roads between Chittagong, Cox's
Bazaar, Teknaf, Khagrachari and Bandarban region. Links were not
yet restored Tuesday, according to an official reached by phone in
Chittagong, 216 kilometers (135 miles) southeast of Dhaka.
	   The weather office said it rained 350 mm (14 inches) in the 48
hours ending Monday evening in Chittagong and Cox's Bazaar regions.
	   The government official, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity, said the rains caused mud slides that killed six people.
Thousands of mud-and-straw houses were damaged.
	   The Water Control Board said Tuesday that heavy rains over the
weekend and Monday had swelled major rivers, threatening more
flooding in coming weeks.

USS Independence completes mission in Japan, steams home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The aircraft carrier USS Independence steamed for
home Tuesday after completing a nearly seven-year mission in Japan,
the last of its nearly forty years in service.
	   The 80,643 ton carrier left U.S. Yokosuka Naval Base, 45
kilometers (28 miles) southwest of Tokyo, for Hawaii with 5,000
crew members on board, including a 2,000-member airwing.
	   In Honolulu, the air crew and their jets, as well as one-third
of the ship's other crew, will transfer to the aircraft carrier
Kitty Hawk.
	   The Kitty Hawk will replace the Independence in Yokosuka on Aug.
11 as the only aircraft carrier based outside the United States.
	   The Independence was launched in 1958 and put into active
service the following year.
	   The carrier has participated in every significant military
action since, including Vietnam, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the
Gulf War, according to Mike Chase, Public Affairs officer for fleet
activities at Yokosuka.
	   Since it was deployed in Yokosuka in September 1991, replacing
the USS Midway, the diesel-powered Independence has made three
trips to the Gulf during times of conflict with Iraq.
	   Servicemen and women in Yokosuka bid farewell to the
Independence, and to the accompanying guided missile cruiser USS
Bunker Hill, at a base-wide picnic on July 4th and with a ceremony
Tuesday morning, Chase said.
	   The Independence will be taken out of active service by the end
of September after returning to San Diego. Military officials will
decide by then whether to put it in mothballs for possible future
deployment, scrap it, or use the ship as a floating military
museum.
	   The carrier coming to replace the Independence, the 1,065-foot
(320-meter) Kitty Hawk is the Navy's only other diesel-powered
carrier. Japan maintains a policy of not allowing nuclear powered
vessels into its ports.
	   The Kitty Hawk, which underwent a dlrs 52.5 million overhaul
earlier this year, will become the Navy's oldest carrier once the
Independence is decommissioned.
	   It is expected to serve 10 years in Japan.

Bangladesh-Thailand to sign extradition treaty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA , Bangladesh (AP) _ Thailand is expected to sign a treaty
with Bangladesh this week that would allow it to extradite a
retired military officer wanted for the 1975 assassination of
Bangladesh's founding father.
	   A Bangladeshi foreign ministry official, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity, said Tuesday the extradition treaty will be
signed following talks between visiting Thai Deputy Foreign
Minister Sukhumbhand Praibatra and his Bangladeshi counterpart Abul
Hasan Choudhury on Wednesday.
	   Bazlul Huda is one of 14 retired army officers accused of
killing Sheikh Mujibur Rahman during a military coup. He has been
in a Bangkok jail since last August on shoplifting charges.
	   Sheikh Mujib, as he was popularly known in Bangladesh, and 15
members of his family were assassinated in a military coup on Aug.
15, 1975.
	   The coup leaders decreed an amnesty for themselves that was
revoked last November by Sheikh Mujib's daughter Sheikh Hasina, who
became prime minister in 1996.
	   Hasina survived the attack on her family because she was
vacationing in Germany at the time.

Singapore Airlines to introduce video-on-demand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Singapore's flag-carrier Singapore Airlines
will begin outfitting its fleet with new video-on-demand technology
by early next year, a senior executive said Tuesday.
	   The Wisemen system, which will allow passengers in first and
business classes to choose and manipulate videos on personal
screens, is still being tested in one Boeing 747-400 aircraft, Yeoh
Teng Kwong told Dow Jones Newswires here.
	   ``We are developing an even higher version that has better
capacity, better speed and better operational logistics,'' Yeoh
said.
	   The airline's existing Krisworld entertainment system, which
offers various channels on a personal video screen and is currently
placed in all classes, costs about dlrs 3.5 million to install.
Wisemen will cost at least dlrs 1 million more per plane.
	   Regarding in-flight gambling, which the carrier introduced on
Krisworld last month, Yeoh said the first test was working well so
far.
	   The carrier offers video blackjack, poker and slot machines with
a maximum allowed loss of dlrs 350 per person per flight and
maximum winnings of dlrs 3,500. But it has done little to promote
the new attraction so far, in part because of legal restrictions.

Malaysia's petroleum company says demand falling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The state oil and gas company
Tuesday said Asia's economic turmoil had resulted in lower
petroleum sales and demand for refined products was likely to fall
further.
	   Annual sales of refined petroleum products fell to 90 million
barrels from 94 million barrels in one year, said Hassan Marican,
head of Petroliam Nasional or Petronas.
	   Hassan predicted that sales would also fall four percent in the
coming year.
	   But overall, the company registered sales increases in all of
its other sectors, including crude oil, petrochemicals and gas.
	   Net profit rose to 9.95 billion ringgit (dlrs 2.4 billion)
compared with 7.28 billion ringgit (dlrs 1.82 billion) the previous
year.
	   Hassan attributed the group's stronger revenue and profitability
mainly to an increase in Petronas' exports.
	   Hassan said Petronas would maintain crude production at 650,000
barrels per day despite the decision of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, to reduce output to pump up
the price of oil.

Nuclear scientist labeled spy wants judges on trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY196 &QL; 
 &UR; By NEELESH MISRA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A decade ago, it seemed nothing could
come between Buddhi Kota Subbarao and a successful physics career.
He was headed to the United States to work with telecommunications
giant AT&AMP;T and hoped to develop India's first nuclear submarine
when he returned.
	   Everything changed on May 30, 1988. As he prepared to board a
plane at Bombay airport for his trip to America, a customs officer
demanded Subbarao open his briefcase and found a sheaf of documents
on nuclear reactors. Subbarao was charged with spying.
	   It took five years _ more than two of them spent in jail _ for
Subbarao to clear himself. Now a lawyer, Subbarao wants more
justice. He is determined to put India's notoriously slow and
overburdened justice system, which he blames in part for his
ordeal, on trial.
	   The documents on nuclear reactors _ his doctoral thesis that he
wanted U.S. scholars to review _ were found to be unclassified.
Subbarao suspects airport customs officials were tipped off as part
of a conspiracy. But he never found evidence that powerful
officials tried to frame him.
	   In May, Subbarao wrote to President K.R. Narayanan accusing two
Supreme Court judges who handled his case, retired Chief Justice
A.M. Ahmadi and the judge set to become the next chief, A.S. Anand,
of ignoring evidence.
	   Ahmadi was unavailable for comment. Anand, like other judges in
India, does not speak to the press.
	   Narayanan referred the petition to federal government officials
to determine what, if any, action should be taken. Subbarao's plea
to the president may eventually be lost in the Indian bureaucratic
labyrinth, but it could revive interest in a case that once won the
backing of leading civil rights campaigners and constitutional
experts.
	   Usha Mehta, a civil rights activist who led a campaign on
Subbarao's behalf in 1988, is among those convinced he was the
victim of a conspiracy. Judges erred by failing to fully study the
evidence or because they lacked ``the courage to act against the
injustice,'' she said.
	   In 1976, Subbarao, then a 39-year-old physicist and navy
captain, began work on a nuclear submarine being developed by the
navy and the Bhabha Atomic Research Center, known as BARC. He says
he pointed out flaws in the designs of BARC scientists that
eventually led the late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to cut off
funds.
	   Subbarao quit the navy a few years later. He submitted his own
submarine design as a doctoral thesis, earning a degree in 1985.
	   Shortly before Subbarao's arrest, Rajiv Gandhi, who had
succeeded his mother as prime minister, revived the nuclear
submarine project. Subbarao said Rajiv Gandhi asked him to lead it,
but the government's confirmation process was never completed.
	   ``BARC already had an animosity for me,'' Subbarao said in a
telephone interview from his home in Bombay. ``When Rajiv Gandhi
tried to give me the command of the project, they conspired to
destroy me.''
	   Raja Ramanna, regarded as one of the pioneers of India's atomic
research program, was chief of BARC at the time. He refused to
comment on Subbarao's claims.
	   Subbarao says reporters, judges, prosecutors and his lawyer did
not understand the thesis police said contained military secrets.
He believes special courts should be established so that experts
can help judge technical cases.
	   This year, the Supreme Court acquitted two rocket experts who
were accused of heading a ring of spies in space laboratories in
southern India, allegedly working for rival Pakistan. The
scientists had been on trial for four years.
	   Jane's Intelligence Review reported in June that India is
expected to produce its first nuclear submarine by 2004.

Burned nurse heads back to Britain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A British nurse who suffered horrific
burns after being doused in petrol and set alight in her Sydney
home said Tuesday she had wanted to die.
	   After five months of painful treatment Gabriella Mazzali, 28, is
heading home to family and friends in Lincoln, Britain after the
ordeal which nearly claimed her life.
	   ``There were many times I wished I was dead, wished I hadn't
survived, but the fact I did means something special,'' Mazzali
said.
	   ``Today I'm anxious but excited and trying to think of it all as
an adventure.''
	   Mazzali's injuries were so extensive that doctors at Sydney's
Concord Hospital originally gave her little chance of surviving.
	   A man whom she knew has since been charged with attempted murder
for the Feb. 4 attack at her Ashfield apartment which left her with
third degree burns to 90 percent of her body.
	   Mazzali confounded doctors who initially contacted her family to
say she was likely to die.
	   Dr. Peter Haertsch, of the hospital's burns unit, said it was a
near-miracle she survived. He said the initial shock caused her
lungs and kidneys to shut down.
	   ``A decision was made that if she hit rock bottom then perhaps,
if she didn't come out of it, maybe we shouldn't persist ... but
she did survive and the long and arduous task of excising burn
tissue started,'' Haertsch said.
	   The former sport-loving nurse has since endured 11 painful skin
grafts. She was so badly injured that doctors were forced to import
artificial skin harvested in the United States.
	   Today, Mazzali said she was anxious about the flight home but
was trying to think of the next 35 hours as an adventure.
	   She sent a tearful thank you to an anonymous Scottish benefactor
who donated the U.S. dlrs 26,000 (42,000 Australian dollars) it
cost to fly Mazzali, her stretcher and a Careflight International
crew to Britain.
	   ``I am eternally grateful to her and to the people in Lincoln
where my parents are from ... they have been running appeal
funds,'' she said. ``I don't know any of these people but they have
shown me so much support.
	   ``It has been tough, and I know I'm not through the woods yet
emotionally ... I try to think this is what's happened to me (and)
I have to get on with life as best I can.''
	   Although her future was uncertain and hampered by the need for
years of medical care, Mazzali had her heart set on returning to
Australia and dreamed of marriage and children in the future.
	   She is still in the early stages of rehabilitation and will be
admitted to Leicester Royal Infirmary for further operations when
she arrives in Britain (at 1200 GMT Wednesday).

MacDougall tests positive to banned substance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ New South Wales representative winger
Adam MacDougall became the third player from champion club
Newcastle to return a positive test to a banned substance in the
past month, the rugby league side revealed Tuesday.
	   MacDougall, 24, played all three games in the State of Origin
series, and joins fellow Knights Robbie O'Davis and Wayne Richards
in returning positive tests. A fourth player, Melbourne's Rodney
Howe, is yet to face the judiciary following a positive test to
steroids.
	   O'Davis and Richards received the maximum 22-match bans for
steroid use, while MacDougall has returned a positive test to
stimulant ephedrine.
	   Newcastle chief executive Ian Bonnette said MacDougall would be
stood down from this week's match pending the result of a test of
his B sample.
	   MacDougall was drug tested after Newcastle's round 13 match
against Cronulla at Sharks Park on June 6, the night after Origin
II.
	   News of MacDougall's positive test was a further blow to the
1997 ARL champion with critics saying the Knights title has been
tainted by the positive tests.

	   The accident occurred at the Bekasovo railway station 80
kilometers (50 miles) southwest of Moscow when a commuter train
bound for Moscow slammed into a service car that had ignored a red
light.
	   The train's three cars derailed, and a second commuter train
coming in the opposite direction crashed into the derailed cars and
the service car.
	   The driver of the service car and two passengers died in the
crash and at least three passengers were wounded, said Irina

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian nuclear submarine on Tuesday
successfully launched a German research satellite from the Barents
Sea, officials said.
	   The Novomoskovsk submarine belonging to the Russian Northern
Fleet launched a booster which put the Tubsat-N satellite into
orbit, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported quoting the navy
officials.

Sleaze controversy hits Blair's government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Struggling to shake off allegations of sleaze in
the government, Prime Minister Tony Blair's office said a close
adviser would be fired if he furthered the business interests of a
controversial lobbyist, the Financial Times reported Tuesday.
	   The charges stem from a newspaper report Sunday saying a Blair
policy adviser helped the lobbyist woo a potential client.
	   Allegations of cronyism helped topple the Conservative
government in national elections 14 months ago.
	   ``For a government elected on a wave of disgust at Tory sleaze,
the parallel is uncomfortable,'' The Guardian said in an editorial
Tuesday.
	   The Observer, which had reporters pose as representatives of
U.S. energy companies, reported Sunday that Roger Liddle, a senior
member of Blair's Policy Unit and a former lobbyist, told the
undercover reporters: ``Just tell me what you want, who you want to
meet, and Derek (Draper) and I will make the call for you.''
	   The newspaper said lobbyist and former Labor Party official
Derek Draper, who boasted he could arrange access to government
officials and documents, was among three former aides to government
ministers who are now selling their contacts.
	   Liddle said he was just being friendly and never offered to
arrange meetings on behalf of Draper's company.
	   Draper, who had worked for GPC Market Access, part of GPC Canada
of Toronto, was suspended by the lobbying company Monday and was
fired from his job as a newspaper columnist. He made no comment.
	   The Express newspaper dismissed Draper because he reportedly
said his columns were reviewed by a government minister before
publication.
	   The Observer said the lobbyists claimed to be able to get
privileged access to government ministers and policies, including
advance information about market-sensitive speeches by Treasury
officials.
	   Britain prides itself on lack of corruption, and a commentary by
U.S. correspondent Gavin Esler that appeared Tuesday in The
Independent compared the latest scandal to American-style lobbying.
	   ``Yet another American idea has crossed the Atlantic. Britain
may have to learn to live with lobbyists, although we will never
love them,'' he wrote. ``It would almost be surprising if
American-style lobbying did not also follow across the Atlantic,
though there is still time to choke off its worst excesses.''
	   Monday night, Blair's office asked The Observer to hand over any
tapes of a conversation with Liddle by 11 a.m. Tuesday. If the
office did not receive the tapes, officials said they would assume
they did not exist.
	   Under the Conservatives, several Tory legislators were found to
have accepted cash or favors via lobbyists for raising issues in
Parliament or facilitating introductions.
	   On Monday, the Conservatives clamored for an investigation.
	   ``It's about cronyism. It's about special favors to friends,''
said Francis Maude, Tory spokesman on finance.

Dollar slips, Tokyo stock prices rise
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with afternoon dollar-yen rate, stock and bond prices &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar slipped against the yen Tuesday as
market participants waited to see if Japan would cut taxes. Tokyo
stock prices rose moderately.
	   The dollar bought 139.86 yen in afternoon trading, down 0.67 yen
from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York rate of
140.15 yen overnight.
	   Trading was subdued amid lingering confusion about whether Japan
would cut income taxes to boost consumption and economic growth.
	   Market participants said Japan's tax policy became clouded after
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto made seemingly contradictory
comments late last week on the likelihood of an income tax cut.
	   On Friday, Hashimoto suggested he would support a permanent
reduction in income taxes. But on Sunday, the prime minister
backtracked, saying he wanted to reform the tax system but that
reform wouldn't necessarily mean a lighter load for individual
taxpayers.
	   Government officials continued to comment on tax policy Tuesday
but there were no clear signs of what measures they might actually
implement.
	   On Tuesday, the head of Japan's Economic Planning Agency, Koji
Omi, told a small group of reporters that a permanent tax cut is
likely.
	   But, also on Tuesday, Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi said his
earlier remark that Japan had made a ``promise'' of permanent tax
cuts was a mistake.
	   ``I hadn't checked with the prime minister, and it was a
misstatement,'' Obuchi said.
	   Traders also hesitated to place bets on the dollar's movement
ahead of Japan's upper house parliamentary elections on Sunday.
	   Japan has been under pressure from its trading partners to spur
growth and create a market for goods from struggling Asian
economies.
	   On the stock market, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained
65.83 points, or 0.40 percent, to close at 16,416.28 points. On
Monday, the Nikkei index closed down 160.79 points, or 0.97
percent, ending eight straight sessions of gains.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section rose 6.36 points, or 0.51 percent, to 1,264.81. The
TOPIX closed down 9.91 points, or 0.78 percent, the day before.
	   Trading on the exchange's main section was estimated at 550
million shares, up from 530.70 million shares Monday.
	   An overnight advance on Wall Street and the slightly stronger
yen were among positive factors affecting the stock market.
Electronics, automobile and banking shares were among the biggest
gainers.
	   On Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 66.51 points,
closing at 9,091.77.
	   A stronger yen tends to encourage foreign investors to buy
Japanese stocks as it increases the value of yen-denominated assets
compared with investments in other currencies.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.310 percent from Monday's finish of 1.300
percent, nudging its price down to 111.11 yen from 111.19 yen.

More Americans are converting to Islam
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos WX102-103 &QL; 
 &UR; By DONNA ABU-NASR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FALLS CHURCH, Virginia (AP) _ Muslim lecturer Anwar Hajjaj
offers potential converts to Islam ``a very delicious meal,'' but
he won't force-feed them. ``If you want it, take it.''
	   A steady stream of Americans are finding the religion appealing
and are becoming Muslims. One of them is Halimatou Wali Diallo.
	   Diallo said she found peace, tranquility and balance after her
conversion from Catholicism last year. ``It enhanced me as a
person,'' said Diallo, 34, a management information systems analyst
in Silver Spring, Maryland.
	   Historians and interest groups could offer no statistics, but
say the number of converts has been building over the past decade,
conforming with a general worldwide growth of the faith.
	   Hajjaj asks potential converts at the Dar el-Hijrah Islamic
Center here three questions: Do they believe in one god? Do they
believe that Jesus was a prophet but was not the son of God? Are
they willing to accept Mohammed as a prophet?
	   If they answer yes, Hajjaj tells them they are ready to become a
Muslim. They do this simply by repeating a verse from the Koran,
Islam's scripture, after him _ ``There is no god but Allah and
Mohammed is his prophet.'' Then a mosque attendant shows the
converts how to perform ablutions, religious washing rituals, and
prayers.
	   Muslim activists insist they are not out to convert people,
citing a verse from the Koran that says: ``Let there be no
compulsion in religion.''
	   Hajjaj, who hosts a weekly radio program about Islam, said he
converts five to eight Americans every month at the center in
Virginia. Farzad Darui, manager of the Islamic Center in
Washington, said 16,000 people have converted through their program
since 1962.
	   Islam also has spread to the Latino community, which now has an
Islamic center in New York, where hundreds of Latinos have
converted since 1992. The center includes a mosque, where the
Friday sermon is given in English, Arabic and Spanish, and it puts
out a religious Spanish-language newspaper.
	   The American Muslim community numbers about 6 million, half of
them African-American. At a reception in February 1996 for Muslim
families to celebrate the end of the holy month of Ramadan, first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton called Islam the fastest-growing
religion in America.
	   William Martin, professor of sociology at Rice University in
Houston, Texas, said the growing number of Muslims in the United
States could have some impact: It could bring more pressure on the
government's dealings with Muslim countries. It could impede
efforts by conservative Christians to return to a Christian nation.
And it would expose more Americans to Muslims.
	   ``Familiarity doesn't always lower the barriers ... but it
can,'' said Martin.
	   Martin said one of the appeals of Islam is its strict morality.
	   ``A lot of people who are living dissipated lives ... feel like
'I really shouldn't be doing this but I really need help,''' said
Martin.
	   As their numbers rise, American Muslims have become more
aggressive about raising awareness about the religion.
	   Muslim groups have published pamphlets on Islamic religious
practices. Glossy catalogs advertise Islamic videos and CDs
featuring songs, cartoons and background on the faith. A 25-poster
set integrates Islamic art and calligraphy with computer graphics
to give basic information about Islam. Mosques around the country
offer classes in Islam and Arabic, which every good believer should
learn in order to read the Koran.
	   Jigsaw puzzles illustrate Islamic landmarks; a watch with a
micro computer chip chimes the entire azan _ call to prayer _ five
times a day; Islamic greeting cards, prayer rugs and ``I love
Islam'' keyholders are easier to find.
	   In addition, activists are helping new converts adapt more
easily to a lifestyle in which dating, drinking, eating pork and
using credit cards are no longer acceptable.
	   Hajjaj offers converts counseling at the Dar el-Hijrah Islamic
center. Some of the questions he helps answer are: How and when are
new converts going to break the news to their family? What should
they do with credit card debts? Islam considers interest usury. How
should they handle friends who think they are crazy because they
have converted?
	   ``We tell them not to reject this culture. Take the good out of
it and leave out the bad. Stay in touch with your family even if
they don't open the door,'' said Hajjaj. ``Let them feel Islam is
building not destroying.''

Man shot in anti-Indonesian protest dies in hospital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A pro-independence protester who was
shot during a demonstration in Irian Jaya province has died in a
hospital, social workers said Tuesday.
	   Protests have been building in the remote province, where a
small group of separatist rebels operates. Activists have been
emboldened by political reforms sweeping Indonesia in the wake of
the May resignation of authoritarian President Suharto.
	   However, the government is unwilling to consider independence
for the mineral-rich province of Irian Jaya and troops on Monday
fired rubber bullets at demonstrators in the town of Biak.
	   Ruben Orboy, a man in his late 20s, was hit in the head by a
rubber bullet and died of his wound Monday in a hospital, said an
official with the Indonesian Red Cross. He requested anonymity.
	   Earlier, the Indonesian military denied unconfirmed reports that
up to seven protesters were killed. That claim came from the
Australia West Papua Association, a Sydney-based group of
supporters of independence for the province.
	   The official Antara news agency reported that at least 24 people
were injured in the clash. It was the latest in a string of
anti-Indonesian rallies in Irian Jaya, a former Dutch colony that
Indonesia took over in 1963.
	   Speaking to The Associated Press from Biak, about 3,200
kilometers (2,000 miles) northeast of Jakarta, army Col. F.X. Agus
Edyono said police officers fired rubber bullets to disperse the
crowd after protesters hurling gasoline bombs burned three street
stalls and a house.
	   About 180 people were arrested, but most of them have been
released.
	   Also Tuesday, dozens of pro-independence demonstrators rallied
in Wamena, another town in Irian Jaya. There were no reports of
violence.
	   Authorities broke up the Biak protest after hundreds of people
had refused their calls to lower a flag of the Free West Papua
Movement, a guerrilla group that wants the province of Irian Jaya
to break away from Indonesia.
	   Last week, demonstrators clashed with security forces in
Jayapura, the provincial capital. One police officer who was beaten
by protesters died in a hospital this past weekend, and two
students who were shot remain in critical condition.

Mexico ruling party rebounds with victory in Chihuahua
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHIHUAHUA, Mexico (AP) _ Seemingly reeling in recent elections,
Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party is showing that
it will not be shoved easily out of power.
	   Sunday's remarkably clean Chihuahua state election gave the PRI
something it had never before seen, and rarely had needed in its 69
years: a return to a governor's seat it had lost.
	   ``We transformed the PRI, and the people responded,'' said
Patricio Martinez, newly elected governor of Mexico's largest
state.
	   With 89 percent of voting places reporting late Monday, Martinez
had 49.3 percent of the vote to 41.3 percent for Ramon Galindo of
the conservative National Action Party.
	   National Action had captured six state governorships over the
past decade and hopes to challenge for the presidency in the year
2000.
	   ``We said that the election in Chihuahua was a very important
election for us,'' said National Action spokesman Javier Corral,
who blamed the loss on a PRI mud-slinging campaign.
	   Outgoing Chihuahua Gov. Francisco Barrio, barred by law from
re-election, was popular in Chihuahua and had been touted as a
possible presidential candidate. The northern state was considered
a National Action stronghold.
	   Many analysts believed the PRI would crumble once out of power.
It was created as an instrument of government in 1929 and
historically depended on handing out patronage to a network of
labor, farm and social groups. It often committed fraud to win
elections.
	   For the first time, the PRI experimented here with a primary
open to voters of any party.
	   President Ernesto Zedillo has said he would like to see a
similar primary nationwide to choose the presidential candidate in
2000.
	   ``I think the PRI won because of the popularity of its
candidate,'' said Alberto Montoya, who voted for National Action in
1992 but displayed a Martinez poster in his shoe store window this
year.
	   He said Galindo ``did not know how to solve problems'' as mayor
of Ciudad Juarez.
	   Barrio's election in 1992 devastated the PRI here. With its line
to state funding and patronage jobs cut, the party found itself
struggling to pay bills. Electricity and phones were briefly cut to
its state headquarters.
	   Yet the party drew on a strong network of ties to unions and
social organizations to rebuild its strength.
	   PRI leaders note they also outpolled National Action in the 1994
presidential election and 1995 state legislative races here.
	   But Sunday's victory is a morale boost for a struggling party.
In recent years it has lost most of Mexico's largest cities and a
series of major northern states to the opposition. Last year it
lost its majority in Congress for the first time, and was thrashed
in the Mexico City mayor's race.
	   The PRI also won the governor's race in north-central Durango
state in Sunday's elections, but a leftist opposition candidate won
in Zacatecas, another northern state.
	   Ricardo Monreal, a popular PRI federal congressman, jumped to
the Democratic Revolution Party after PRI leaders chose Jose Olvera
Acevedo as their candidate for governor.
	   With 78 percent of the ballots counted, Monreal had 188,878
votes to Olvera's 158,724, state election officials said.
	   It was the leftist party's first gubernatorial victory, and it
came in the north, where the party has been weak.
	   In Durango, the PRI's candidate, Angel Sergio Guerrero Mier,
easily won the governor's race.

Harsh criticism of Japan in pro-government Singapore newspaper
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's leading pro-government newspaper on
Tuesday attacked the economic policy of Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto, adding that he ``lacks political will.''
	   In an usually harsh editorial, The Straits Times said
Hashimoto's reluctance to introduce tax cuts he had promised
earlier ``shows how feeble and indecisive he is.''
	   ``On Sunday, he fudged and flip-flopped. Not for the first time.
Nor will this be the last. The world cannot but shake its head at
Japan's vaccilating leadership,'' the English-language paper said.
	   ``Above all, he lacks political will. His action bespeaks the
problem of inertia, if not paralysis, at the top,'' said the
editorial in Singapore's leading daily, which has a circulation of
about 400,000.
	   Japan, which faces its biggest economic difficulties since World
War II, has been widely criticized for failing to overcome its
problems, thus prolonging the economic malaise in the region.
	   Relations between Japan and affluent Singapore, which so far has
escaped the full brunt of the crisis, have been cordial and
cooperative in the past. Tens of thousands of Japanese work and
study in this city-state of 3.1 million.
	   In April, Japan's ambassador to Singapore, Hiroshi Hashimoto,
said the Singapore government ``does not criticize Japan for the
lack of appropriate policies.'' But he added that Singapore
``strongly desires'' Japan to overcome its difficulties and expand
its consumer demand. This would make Japan able to buy more
products from its neighbors, including Singapore.
	   Now, judging from the Straits Times editorial, Singapore may
have lost some of its patience.
	   Lee Kuan Yew, who long served as prime minister and still has
wide influence, earlier this week reiterated Japan's role in the
region's future.
	   ``Singapore and the region will not fully recover until Japan
recovers,'' Lee said. ``Nobody, at present, can say with confidence
when that will be.''

U.N.: Russia uncertainty threatens East Europe upturn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Uncertainty in Russia poses the greatest potential
risk to improving economies in East Europe, a U.N. report said
Tuesday.
	   Japan's recession also could affect growth prospects unless
quickly reversed, according to the Economic Survey of Europe, which
also includes North America.
	   ``On balance developments have remained positive in the first
half of the year,'' said the survey, a 24-page update to the U.N.
Economic Commission for Europe's report for 1997.
	   The report saw a positive short-term outlook for most of East
Europe over the second half of this year. Hungary, Slovenia and
Estonia are likely to exceed expectations, it said. Prospects were
less bright in Bulgaria and Romania.
	   Although ``the outlook is not at all clear,'' the survey said
Russian economic growth could slip ``if instability and policy
austerity continue.''
	   ``In the second half of the year there could even be a fall in
aggregate output,'' the report said.
	   Russia's poor outlook is rooted in its high degree of dependence
on commodity exports and its tendency to finance its deficit with
foreign funds, commission chairwoman Eveline Herfkens said.
	   Russia's priority must be to fully reform its tax system,
addressing the government's chronic inability to collect taxes, the
report said. Devaluing the Russian ruble might ``provide some
temporary relief for the economy,'' it added.
	   Falling world commodity prices this year have had a negative
impact on Russia's outlook, Herfkens said.
	   The commission's report for 1997, released in April, said the
apparent halt to Russia's economic slide had helped former Soviet
bloc countries to their first overall year of growth since the end
of communism. It cautiously predicted continued growth for Russia
this year.

	   PAMPLONA, Spain (AP) _ One Spaniard was gored in the groin and
another was injured when trampled on by rushing crowds in the
opening bullrun of the famed annual San Fermin festival Tuesday.
	   The 850-meter (935 yards) run, in which hundreds of people race
ahead of six fighting bulls and their guiding steers as the beasts
stampede through the cobblestone streets of this northern town,
started on the dot at 8 a.m. (0600 gmt) and was over in less than
three minutes.
	   Thousands of people, including many foreigners, flock to
Pamplona each year for the nine-day festival which kicked off
Monday. The celebrations, whose highlight is the morning bull-run
together with 24-hour reveling, was made world famous by Ernest
Hemingway's 1927 novel ``Fiesta, The Sun Also Rises.''
	   Injuries are frequent and death is always a possibility during
the runs, or `encierros' as they are called in Spanish.
	   The goring victim Tuesday was named as Juanxto Gazpio Irujo, 22,
of Pamplona. His condition was said to be stable. Another Spaniard,
Daniel Cascante Hernandez, suffered back injuries when he fell at
the beginning of the run and was trampled on by people coming
behind him.
	   The last fatality was a 22-year-old American gored to death in
1995, the 13th runner to die since records began in 1924, and the
first since 1980.
	   The bulls featured in the run are killed by matadors in the
bullfight later in the day.
	   Historians say daredevils flaunting authority began running with
the bulls four centuries ago.

Prime minister hears complaints from oil, gas producers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL ALEXANDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam's red tape and high taxes are
encouraging businessmen to look elsewhere for opportunities,
foreign oil and gas companies told Prime Minister Phan Van Khai on
Tuesday.
	   As Khai, other government officials and diplomats listened
intently, they listed a litany of problems that they said have cut
exploration to a trickle even as the country seeks more investment
to ease the impact of the Asian economic crisis.
	   In 1992, about 40 exploratory wells were in development. Only a
handful are in the pipeline today as the number of new licenses has
shrunk.
	   Amoco and Texaco are among those who have pulled out. Others
have increasing trouble justifying their efforts as other parts of
the world clamor for investment.
	   ``You are competing for a limited pool of resources,'' Chevron's
Steve Patti said.
	   U.S. Ambassador Pete Peterson added that Vietnam has a ``closing
window of opportunity ... if the climate is not improved.''
	   ``It's a troubled industry,'' he said. ``Millions of dollars
have been invested ... and very few dollars, in return, have been
made. That cannot continue.
	   ``Vietnam's success as an economic power in Asia is linked
directly to the energy sector. You have energy sitting out at sea
and demands on shore that aren't being met.''
	   Conoco, Chevron, FINA and Petronas said they suffer from the
highest taxes of any industry in Vietnam, have to offer tenders on
any expense over dlrs 50,000 and lose money while waiting for
license approval, which can take up to four years.
	   They urged the government to streamline procedures by creating a
``one-stop'' department that would liaise with all the agencies
that foreign investors currently have to deal with directly.
	   ``We will either win together or lose together,'' J.S. Walter of
BP said, adding that every day's delay in creating an attractive
environment costs Vietnam dlrs 700,000 in lost revenue and
increased costs of electricity.
	   The bureaucratic tangle _ conflicting laws, customs delays and
other red tape _ was a regular complaint. Khai was sympathetic.
	   ``The documents and regulations are mounting up,'' he said. ``We
need to reduce their number. It will take us to the end of the
year.''
	   While the oil officials were happy to hear promises that things
are getting better, this was the third time Khai has met with
foreign investors this year.
	   They were optimistic after the earlier meetings. Now they said
the proof of the government's commitment will be in actions.
	   ``We were hoping customs clearance would be improved after the
last meeting with the prime minister,'' FINA's Pascal Petteau said.
``But there appear to be no new initiatives.''
	   Top officials from three government ministries replied that they
are tackling some issues. The customs head told businessmen that a
new blueprint for operations is being implemented and to call him
directly if they have problems.
	   But the officials said National Assembly approval is needed for
some changes. The legislature's next monthlong session opens in
October.

	   LONDON (AP) _ The Financial Times newspaper reported Tuesday
that the London and Frankfurt stock exchanges were expected to
announce an initiative that could be a step toward development of a
European equity market.
	   The London Stock Exchange scheduled a morning news conference
but would not say what the subject would be.
	   Under the headline ``London, Frankfurt markets may unveil joint
venture,'' the Financial Times ran its one paragraph item, which
also said the London Stock Exchange had so far dismissed talk of
teaming up with continental bourses.

Parties agree on financial blueprint for new government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Three Dutch power-sharing
political parties working to form a new coalition government have
reached agreement on a financial blueprint.
	   The left-of-center Labor Party, right-leaning Liberal Party and
centrist Democrats 66 started talks shortly after May 6 general
elections. Those three parties have formed the core of Dutch
government for the past four years.
	   Leaders overseeing the formation of the new government reached
agreement late Tuesday on financial details. Although other issues
still need to be worked out, Queen Beatrix is expected to soon
appoint a person who will actually form the new government next
week.
	   The accord on finances includes a commitment to stick to the
practice of using any budgetary windfalls to reduce the deficit and
ease taxes.
	   Coalition governments have ruled for the past 80 years in the
Netherlands, where there are a dozen sizable parties, none of which
has been able to garner enough votes to take control outright.
	   It typically takes months to form a new government in the
Netherlands; in 1977, it took more than 200 days to accomplish.

Shark the loser in attack on bathers

	   PLETTENBERG BAY, South Africa (AP) _ A father and son were
attacked by a 1.3-meter (-yard) long shark, but the shark wound up
being the loser when the father dragged it ashore and dumped it on
the beach, media reports said Tuesday.
	   Clark Thomas, 47, and his 10-year-old son Mark were in
waist-deep water on Monday when the shark bit both of them on their
right legs. The father grabbed the ragged-tooth shark, carried it
ashore and dropped it on the sand, then went with his son for
medical treatment, the reports said.
	   The Thomases each received stitches to close their wounds.
	   The attack happened in Plettenberg Bay in the Indian Ocean in
southern South Africa.
	   At least six people have been injured in shark attacks off South
Africa in the past six weeks. One of the victims died.

Sicilian businessmen and politicians arrested for Mafia ties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PALERMO, Sicily (AP) _ Police on Tuesday arrested more than 40
people suspected of ties to the Mafia, including scores of
prominent Sicilian businessmen and politicians.
	   Those arrested include an ex-mayor of Palermo, the island's
capital, a former provincial president, and two executives of a
company owned by the Italian auto-giant FIAT.
	   In an overnight raid, police arrested 31 people in the Palermo
area and 15 in Trapani, a large city on Sicily's west coast.
	   The businessmen and politicians allegedly received kickbacks in
exchange for helping Sicily's organized crime clans secure public
works contracts, which included at least two waste treatment
plants.
	   Police said numerous Mafia turncoats helped them break the case.

Swiss racing car driver and maker Peter Monteverdi dies at 64
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BINNINGEN, Switzerland (AP) _ Former racing car driver and
luxury sports car maker Peter Monteverdi, who built and drove
Switzerland's only Formula One car, has died, his business partner
said. He was 64.
	   Monteverdi died of cancer at his home in Binningen on Saturday,
his long-time friend and business partner Paul Berger said Monday.
	   Monteverdi took 10th place in the Grand Prix at Solitude in
Germany in 1961 with his Formula One car, which was powered by a
Porsche engine and had a top speed of 260 kilometers per hour (162
mph). He gave up motor racing after he and the car were involved in
a serious accident at the Hockenheim circuit in Germany the same
year.
	   He went on to design and build a range of exclusive, high-speed
cars driven by celebrities including the Shah of Iran.
	   Born in Binningen, where his father owned a small car repair
shop, Monteverdi developed an enthusiasm for cars at an early age,
according to a biography produced by his company.
	   At the age of 17, Monteverdi built his first car, the Monteverdi
Special, using the wreck of a Fiat vehicle.
	   In 1956, after his father died, Monteverdi took over the family
car repair shop and began designing and building racing cars.
	   His first models, Formula Junior cars, were sold in many
countries, the biography said.
	   After quitting Formula One, Monteverdi developed the business in
exclusive luxury cars, producing a range of high-speed coupes,
convertibles and limousines.
	   The Monteverdi High Speed was displayed at the Frankfurt car
show in the fall of 1967.
	   Following the energy crisis of 1973, he decided to switch to
developing luxury four-wheel drive machines, among them the Sahara
and Safari.
	   Monteverdi was involved in designing a version of British
Leyland's Range Rover.
	   His firm stopped production in 1982, and the Binningen factory
was converted into a museum to hold his collection of 70-80 cars,
purported to be Switzerland's largest.
	   Monteverdi was unmarried, without children. Funeral arrangements
have not yet been arranged.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko will
visit China next week for talks focusing on economic and trade
relations between the two giant neighbors, the Chinese Foreign
Ministry announced Tuesday.
	   The visit, at the invitation of Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji, will
be Kiriyenko's first to China since President Boris Yeltsin
appointed him in March.
	   The Russian premier and Chinese leaders will ``exchange views on
the bilateral relations, in particular economic cooperation and
trade, as well as other issues of common interest,'' Chinese
Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang told reporters.
	   He said Kiriyenko was coming next Tuesday, but did not say how
long his visit would last.

Swissair strikes up alliance with Japan Airlines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss national airline Swissair has
formed a partnership with Japan Airlines, the companies said in a
joint statement Tuesday.
	   The two firms say the agreement will offer customers a better
service pattern, improved connections and more sales outlets around
the world. It will also improve frequencies on the airlines'
Switzerland to Japan routes, the statement said.
	   The collaboration will extend into other fields such as
catering, luggage handling and aircraft maintenance.
	   ``It's going to give all our customers real and tangible
benefits, and it's going to enhance the profitability of both
partners, too,'' said Swissair Group Chief Executive Officer
Philippe Bruggisser.
	   The partnership represents the latest move by Swissair towards
developing a wide network of alliances with other airlines.
	   Last week, it agreed a partnership with Hong Kong based carrier
Cathay Pacific.
	   Swissair already has alliances with Delta Airlines in the United
States, Austrian Airlines, Belgium's Sabena, Air Portugal, Turkish
Airlines and AOM of France.

Military expert: Japan's forces more upbeat than the West
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The mood in Japan's well-funded military is more
upbeat than in fighting forces in the West, where declining budgets
are sapping morale, a U.S. expert on the military said Tuesday.
	   Charles Moskos, a military sociologist at Northwestern
University, said Japan's Self-Defense Force has also won prestige
with successful performances in several U.N. peacekeeping missions.
	   ``The SDF in some sense has its future in front of it, while
many of the Western countries including America feel that the
future of the military is behind it,'' Moskos said.
	   While funding for militaries in the West is declining, the
Japanese military has not faced major cutbacks and does not suffer
from many of the racial and other social divisions elsewhere,
Moskos said.
	   The Japanese spend about 1 percent of gross national product on
defense. The U.S. military, meanwhile, had cut manpower by a third
in the past 10 years, though defense still commands 2.5 percent of
GNP, he said.
	   Moskos, who has also advised the U.S. government about its
policy on gays in the military, said, however, that the SDF also
faces limitations in its reach.
	   For example, the Japanese Constitution bars it from offensive
military action. And lingering suspicions over Japan's World War II
conquest of East Asia prevent it from taking a more active regional
role.
	   ``Japan could not take the lead'' in a peacekeeping operation,
Moskos said.
	   Moskos, in Japan to give a series of lectures to Japan's
National Defense Academy, told reporters that the proliferation of
U.N. peacekeeping missions also has changed the relationship
between the military and the media.
	   In U.S. military actions in Grenada and Panama and in the Gulf
War, the media were kept under official control and reporters'
movements were tightly restricted, he said.
	   But in peacekeeping operations, reporters are more independent
and usually are already on the ground when troops arrive.
	   ``When the media can be there first, it sets a new tone. The
media know more about the local situation,'' Moskos said, adding
that often the military turns to reporters for information.
	   ``The media now has to be treated much more gently or lightly
because they're there, they're independent,'' he said.

Assad names new intelligence chief, prepares for more changes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Syrian President Hafez Assad has reportedly
named a new head for the country's powerful intelligence service, a
week after he dismissed the former director.
	   Assad fired Maj. Gen. Bashir al-Najar after accusing him of
corruption and negligence of duty. He also pensioned off Gen.
Hikmat Al-Shihabi, his army chief of staff.
	   Assad named as his new intelligence chief Maj. Gen. Mahmoud
al-Saqqa, a veteran army officer who participated in the U.S.-led
international coalition that drove Iraqi troops out of Kuwait in
the 1991 Gulf War, Syrian sources and Arab diplomats said Tuesday,
speaking only on condition of anonymity.
	   The moves may be a prelude to wider changes in the government
and the ruling Baath party, including a higher army position for
his son Bashar, they said by telephone.
	   Bashar, a British-trained ophthalmologist, has reportedly been
groomed by Assad for his succession following the death of his
brother Basil in a car crash in 1994.
	   Bashar was expected to be promoted to the rank of army colonel
and named as head of the Regional Command of the Baath Party, the
highest decision-making body in Syria, the diplomats said.
	   Bashar has a military rank of lieutenant colonel and is
commander-in-chief of the Republican Guards.
	   Al-Shihabi, a senior member of the Baath Party and a close
associate to Assad, is expected to be named vice president for
security affairs, a post which was held by Assad's brother Rifaat
until he was fired in February.
	   Shibabi's successor, Gen. Ali Aslan, was sworn in Sunday.
	   Syrian opposition leaders in Europe said Assad was preparing the
ground for Bashar's succession in case he dies. Assad, 68, has
diabetes and suffered a heart attack in 1983.
	   Al-Saqqa was head of the military intelligence in the strategic
Golan Heights and later chief security officer of the Syrian forces
who fought against Iraq in the Gulf War.
	   Under Assad, who has ruled for nearly 28 years, Syria long
followed a staid, socialist path to development, although free
market reforms were introduced in recent years. Its radical
policies often put it at odds with other Arab states.

Cambodian police investigate grenade attack at amusement park
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Police on Tuesday were leaning away
from blaming politics as the motive of a grenade attack at a
children's amusement park that killed one person and injured six
others.
	   Khieu Sopheak, an Interior Ministry official, said that the
attack Monday night was still under investigation but appeared to
stem from a personal dispute.
	   The blast came during the tense run-up to parliamentary
elections July 26, but there was no obvious political target at the
site, near the luxury Cambodiana hotel.
	   The government called a news conference Tuesday promising ``to
show who is the mastermind,'' hinting members of the opposition
might be blamed for the explosion. Officials later canceled the
briefing without explanation.
	   A bystander said that minutes before the explosion, she saw an
intense argument between a man in a coffee-colored bodyguard
uniform _ who she thinks later threw the grenade as he was fleeing
_ and a man in civilian clothes, a human rights worker said.
	   But police said that they thought the lethal device was tossed
into the park from a passing motorbike.
	   The only confirmed fatality was Chan Pich Reasey, 19.
	   Cambodia is awash with weapons, a legacy of more than two
decades of civil war. Laws controlling unauthorized possession of
guns and grenades are rarely enforced.
	   More than 16 people were killed and 100 injured in March 1997
when four grenades were lobbed into a peaceful protest led by Sam
Rainsy, one of the leading opposition election candidates.
	   Sam Rainsy was slightly injured. The attack was widely blamed on
strongman Hun Sen.

	   TUCSON, Arizona (AP) _ The U.S. national baseball team lost for
a second time to Australia but won its contest with the Japan
College Stars in a doubleheader.
	   Australia completed a two-game sweep with Monday's 8-5 victory.
Australia and USA are paired in Group B of the World Championships

	   ``Go back to high school,'' he yelled as he left the field.
	   USA rallied for four runs in the bottom of the inning but it was
too little, too late.
	   P. Dale (1-0) got the win and Shane Tonkin picked up a save for
his one-third inning's work in the ninth. Jason Jennings (3-1)
suffered the loss for two 1-3 innings.

Miners block Siberian rail line for fifth day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Striking coal miners blocked traffic on the
Trans-Siberian railway for the fifth day Tuesday, a protest that
has cost an estimated 7 million rubles (dlrs 1.2 million), news
reports said.
	   Trains are now stranded in several places along the
Trans-Siberian, with industry in the Tomsk region ground to a halt
because the area's one link to the railway has been blocked, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Several hundred miners in the central Siberian mining town of
Anzhero-Sudzhensk began the protest Friday over government plans to
close mines and reduce subsidies to local coal-related industries.
	   Negotiations between miners and the government have been
unsuccessful. Protesters have been demanding that Vice Premier Oleg
Sysuyev come to the Kemerevo region to review a settlement that
ended a similar blockade in May. The miners claim the government is
not paying the back wages it promised in the agreement.
	   But Sysuyev has said a meeting will not take place until the
miners lift their blockade.
	   The latest protest has resulted in an estimated 7 million rubles
(dlrs 1.2 million) in losses, Oleg Moshenko, the deputy railway
minister, was quoted as saying by ITAR-Tass.
	   Russia has been gradually shutting down loss-making coal mines.
But some mines are the lone source of employment in isolated
regions, and fired miners have difficulty finding new work.

German job market `unusually strong' in June, labor office says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NUREMBERG, Germany (AP) _ Germany's job market showed
``unusually strong'' improvement in June, due partly to an upswing
in the German economy, Labor Office President Bernhard Jagoda said
Tuesday.
	   Confirming figures released last week by Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
who is seeking to bolster his sagging re-election bid, Jagoda said
unemployment dropped to 10.5 percent last month from 10.9 percent
in May.
	   Total unemployed dropped 122,300 to 4.075 million _ an
improvement beyond what could be expected through seasonal factors
alone, he said.
	   When adjusted for seasonal factors, the number of unemployed
fell 49,000 in June from May, the labor office said.
	   In addition to the spread of Germany's economic upswing, Jagoda
credited an expansion of government job-creation programs and a
gradual decline in the number of people looking for work.
	   Eastern Germany saw its first decline in nearly three years in
the monthly figures, compared to the year before. The former
communist states had an unemployment rate of 17.2 percent in June,
compared to 17.5 percent in June 1997.
	   However, the rate was still nearly double the 8.9 percent logged
in western Germany.
	   Germany's high jobless rate has been the key campaign issue in
this year's federal election, set for Sept. 27.
	   Kohl, who has been trailing his Social Democratic challenger,
Gerhard Schroeder, in the polls for months, has presented the
latest declines _ from a high of 12.6 percent early this year _ as
evidence that his policies were taking hold.
	   The Social Democrats, however, charge the improvement is due
mainly to temporary make-work measures financed by the government,
not a real recovery in the labor market.

Finance Minister: Malaysia to revise growth targets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia will revise its growth
target but try to halt a slide into recession, Finance Minister
Anwar Ibrahim said Tuesday.
	   ``We are hoping not to go to the negative. We are looking at the
figures and want to know how fast can the (country's latest)
stimulus package be implemented,'' Anwar told reporters.
	   In the last two weeks, the government has announced two packages
totaling 12 billion ringgit (dlrs 3 billion) to revive the economy
by injecting funds.
	   Anwar, who is also the deputy prime minister, said more such
steps would be taken. ``The government will try to stimulate the
economy by establishing new funds.''
	   The extra spending will go toward rural development and public
infrastructure projects. The money would come from bond issues,
both local and domestic, as well as other sources, he said.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, in a separate comments to
reporters at a meeting of domestic businessmen and bankers, said
new rules were needed to aid companies battered by currency
devaluations.
	   ``The idea is not to help bad companies but to enable good
companies to survive when their failure is not of their own
making,'' Mahathir said.
	   No details were provided, but Mahathir has often said that such
companies should be able to easily obtain loans despite their
critical health. He has also spoken of lenient bankruptcy laws.
	   Many banks, worried that depositors' savings could be
squandered, have tightened rules governing credit.
	   ``We have to be prudent. We have our depositors' funds to
protect,'' a top banker told The Associated Press. He spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   Malaysia's economy contracted by 1.8 percent in the first three
months of 1998, compared to 6.9 percent growth in the previous
quarter. So far, the government had maintained that it would be
able to achieve gross domestic product growth of between 2 and 3
percent for the year.
	   Many independent economists have described the goal as
optimistic, predicting a full-blown recession, or contraction over
two successive quarters. They say the economy could shrink by up to
4 percent this year.
	   Apparently frustrated that tough monetary and fiscal policies,
which were backed by Anwar, had failed to stabilize the economy,
Mahathir has spoken of the need to loosen purse strings and lend
more to companies.
	   Last month, Mahathir appointed Daim Zainuddin, a former finance
minister, as Cabinet minister to supervise economic recovery. Both
Mahathir and Daim have favored lower interest rates and easier
credit as a route toward recovery.
	   On Tuesday, Mahathir also said it was beyond the control of his
government to stabilize the ringgit, reiterating his accusations
against currency speculators.
	   ``We can't achieve stable exchange rates because even if we
behave ourselves like a good boy ... they will still attack our
exchange rates,'' he said.

Shark the loser in attack on bathers

<TEXT>
	   PLETTENBERG BAY, South Africa (AP) _ A father and son were
attacked by a 1.3-meter (-yard) long shark, but the shark wound up
the loser when the father dragged it ashore and dumped it onto the
beach, media reports said Tuesday.
	   Mark Thomas, 10, had just caught a wave on his surfboard in
waist-deep water Monday when the ragged-tooth shark reared up and
sunk its teeth into the boy's right leg, the newspaper Beeld
reported.
	   Clark Thomas grabbed the shark and pulled it off his son,
succeeding but also getting bitten in the right leg in the process.
	   ``I grabbed the shark in a vise grip, pulled it out of the ocean
and threw it onto the beach,'' the 47-year-old father was quoted as
saying.
	   Mark needed 22 stitches and his father 21, media reports said.
	   With the attack on Monday happening amid a spate of shark
incidents, doctors dissected the fish to see if it had attacked
other bathers. No human flesh was found in its stomach, Beeld said.
	   The attack happened in Plettenberg Bay in the Indian Ocean, 450
kilometers (280 miles) east of Cape Town.
	   At least six people have been injured in shark attacks off South
Africa in the past six weeks. One of the victims died.
	   Sharks apparently mistake some wetsuit-clad surfers for seals or
turtles. Others approach the coast to feed on schools of sardines
which make migratory runs past the shores.
	   Dive operators also lure sharks into coastal waters by throwing
bait into the ocean so paying customers in underwater cages can
view the predators.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian nuclear submarine on Tuesday
successfully launched a German research satellite from the Barents
Sea _ the first commercial space launch in the history of the
Russian Navy, officials said.
	   The Tubsat-N satellite was put into orbit by the RSM-54
intercontinental ballistic missile launched by the Novomoskovsk
submarine belonging to the Russian Northern Fleet, Russian news
reports said, quoting navy officials.
	   The 10-kilogram (22-pound) satellite, developed by the Berlin
Technical University, will provide communication services and also
help count northern animals and relay other ecological information.
	   The RSM-54, which is called SS-N-23 in the West, is a standard
weapon of Russian nuclear-powered submarines.

Top officials cleared of being Securitate collaborators
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ An official investigation has found
that President Emil Constantinescu and other top officials never
served as informants for the Communist-era secret police, Romanian
national radio reported Tuesday.
	   The investigation, ordered by Constantinescu last week, followed
recent exposes of religious and political figures, some of whom
admitted having been informers for the dreaded Securitate. The
health minister resigned, and other lawmakers also quit their
posts.
	   Constantinescu asked intelligence officials to check the
archives and report whether members of National Supreme Defense
Council had worked for the Securitate, which was disbanded after
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was executed in the 1989 anti-Communist
revolution.
	   The council includes the president, chiefs of the domestic and
foreign intelligence services, the prime minister, head of the
armed forces and leaders of key ministries.
	   ``We had to make sure that no top official of this country could
be blackmailed,'' Constantinescu said late Monday.
	   Prime Minister Radu Vasile also said none of his ministers had
worked for the Securitate. Finance Minister Daniel Daianu, who was
a foreign intelligence agent, resigned from the spy service ``many
years ago'' and would not be asked to leave his job, Vasile said.
	   One in four Romanian adults was said to have worked for the
Securitate during more than 40 years of Communist rule.
	   Last month, Laszlo Toekes, an ethnic Hungarian Protestant bishop
whose opposition to Ceausescu sparked the 1989 revolt, admitted
that he too had collaborated with the secret police after years of
harassment.
	   An estimated 125 million pages of Securitate files are kept
under lock and key. Nevertheless, leaks about alleged links to the
security service have led to many blackmail cases.
	   ``Trust in the state institutions must be restored,''
Constantinescu said. He said the investigation was part of a
``moral reform'' of Romanian society.

Assad names new intelligence chief, prepares for more changes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES that Assad did not make charges personally in 2nd
graf, grip on power firm in 10th graf. &QL; 
 &UR; By SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Syrian President Hafez Assad has reportedly
named a new head for the country's powerful intelligence service, a
week after he dismissed the former director.
	   Assad fired Maj. Gen. Bashir al-Najar. Arab newspapers quoting
official sources said the general was suspected of corruption and
accused of negligence of duty. Assad also pensioned off Gen. Hikmat
Al-Shihabi, his army chief of staff.
	   Assad named as his new intelligence chief Maj. Gen. Mahmoud
al-Saqqa, a veteran army officer who participated in the U.S.-led
international coalition that drove Iraqi troops out of Kuwait in
the 1991 Gulf War, Syrian sources and Arab diplomats said Tuesday,
speaking only on condition of anonymity.
	   The moves may be a prelude to wider changes in the government
and the ruling Baath party, including a higher army position for
his son Bashar, they said by telephone.
	   Bashar, a British-trained ophthalmologist, has reportedly been
groomed by Assad for his succession following the death of his
brother Basil in a car crash in 1994.
	   Bashar was expected to be promoted to the rank of army colonel
and named as head of the Regional Command of the Baath Party, the
highest decision-making body in Syria, the diplomats said.
	   Bashar has a military rank of lieutenant colonel and is
commander-in-chief of the Republican Guards.
	   Al-Shihabi, a senior member of the Baath Party and a close
associate to Assad, is expected to be named vice president for
security affairs, a post which was held by Assad's brother Rifaat
until he was fired in February.
	   Shibabi's successor, Gen. Ali Aslan, was sworn in Sunday.
	   Syrian opposition leaders in Europe said Assad was preparing the
ground for Bashar's succession in case he dies. Assad, 68, has
diabetes and suffered a heart attack in 1983, although his grip on
power remains firm.
	   Al-Saqqa was head of the military intelligence in the strategic
Golan Heights and later chief security officer of the Syrian forces
who fought against Iraq in the Gulf War.
	   Under Assad, who has ruled for nearly 28 years, Syria long
followed a staid, socialist path to development, although free
market reforms were introduced in recent years. Its radical
policies often put it at odds with other Arab states.

Tokyo stock prices rise, dollar slips
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late afternoon dollar-yen rate and bond price &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stocks rose moderately Tuesday on hopes the
government would adopt a permanent income tax cut after elections
Sunday, traders said. The U.S. dollar fell against the Japanese
yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 65.83 points, or 0.40
percent, closing at 16,416.28. On Monday, the Nikkei index had
fallen 160.79 points, or 0.97 percent, ending eight straight
sessions of gains.
	   The U.S. dollar bought 139.83 yen in late afternoon, down 0.70
yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York rate
of 140.15 yen overnight.
	   Blue-chip shares, including Sony, posted strong gains.
	   ``The market tone was firm on expectations that the government
will take action to implement permanent income tax cuts after the
elections and before Hashimoto's visit to the United States on July
22,'' said Masatoshi Sato, manager of the investor information
group at Kankaku Securities.
	   But some investors and traders said there was lingering
confusion in the market following a series of contradictory
comments by government officials Monday and Tuesday on tax policy.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section rose 6.36 points, or 0.51 percent, to 1,264.81. It
had fallen down 9.91 points, or 0.78 percent, the previous day.
	   Trading on the exchange's main section was estimated at 544
million shares, up from 531 million Monday. Advances outnumbered
declines 698 to 446, while 140 issues were unchanged.
	   Critics at home and abroad have called on Japan to cut taxes as
a way of spurring growth in an economy that shrank in the first
quarter of the year.
	   But it wasn't clear if the government was ready to take their
advice.
	   Japan's tax policy became especially clouded after Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto made seemingly contradictory comments on
the likelihood of an income tax cut.
	   On Friday, Hashimoto suggested he would support a permanent
reduction in income taxes. But on Sunday, the prime minister
backtracked, saying he wanted to reform the tax system but that
reform wouldn't necessarily mean a lighter load for individual
taxpayers.
	   On Tuesday, the head of Japan's Economic Planning Agency, Koji
Omi, told a small group of reporters that a permanent tax cut is
likely.
	   But, also on Tuesday, Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi said an
earlier remark that Japan had made a ``promise'' of permanent tax
cuts was a mistake.
	   ``I hadn't checked with the prime minister, and it was a
misstatement,'' Obuchi said.
	   In currency trading, the dollar fell against the yen as traders
hesitated to place bets on the U.S. currency's movement ahead of
Japan's upper house parliamentary elections on Sunday.
	   The dollar was quoted as high as 140.14 yen and as low as 139.50
in Tuesday's trading.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.305 percent from Monday's finish of 1.300
percent, nudging its price down to 111.15 yen from 111.19 yen.

Summary executions highlight launch of Kosovo observer mission

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police battling ethnic Albanian
insurgents near one of Kosovo's largest cities gained ground
against the rebels after overnight battles, Serb sources reported
Tuesday.
	   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said fighting
in the region near the southwestern city of Pec appeared to be
continuing Tuesday. But with phone lines cut and the main road
leading into are sealed off by Serb police for security reasons,
the report could not be verified.
	   The fighting flared Monday, with the ethnic-Albanian-run Kosovo
Information Center reporting one person killed and three wounded by
heavy shelling of Lodja village, near Pec.
	   Serb sources said armed Albanians opened fire on Serb villagers,
forcing a Serb counter-attack.
	   The pro-government Serb Media Center reported two policemen
killed and six others wounded in the fighting at Lodja.
	   Closer to Pristina, tensions were high in the 3,000-member
community of Pirane, 75 kilometers (45 miles) southwest of the
provincial capital, following the burials of three ethnic Albanian
farmers.
	   Official Serb reports said the three were murdered by their own
people for betraying them. But the villagers say the slayings are
the handiwork of Serb police.
	   The contradictory allegations highlight the constant conflicting
propaganda in Serbia's disputed Kosovo province, where ethnic
Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1. Western diplomats hope to bring
some clarity to the confusion with the launch this week of a
multi-national observer mission.
	   Since Serb forces launched a crackdown on ethnic Albanian
militants on Feb. 28, a tangle of roadblocks have prevented any
outside observers from confirming reports of fighting. Information
is largely channeled through centers representing either side.
	   The relatives' claims of summary execution by police came hours
after the Serb Media Center, which compiles official Serb
information, told reporters that ethnic Albanian militants killed
the three with automatic weapons because they were loyal to the
Serbs. Serbia is one of the two remaining republics in Yugoslavia.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo. Recent attempts
to bring ethnic Albanian leaders and the Yugoslav government to the
negotiating table have produced few results.
	   Western observers, Belgrade-based diplomats from the United
States, Russia, Poland and the European Union will regularly tour
villages in Kosovo to try and clarify the situation on the ground.
	   They also will share information with humanitarian organizations
struggling to cope with a flood of refugees and conflicts in the
remote Kosovo mountains where neighboring Serb and ethnic Albanian
villages form a checkerboard of front lines.

Four clerics in Egypt face charges for wrongdoing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Four Muslim clergymen faced a disciplinary
panel Tuesday to answer charges of wrongdoing for criticizing one
of Egypt's chief clerics for meeting an Israeli rabbi.
	   The instructors at Al-Azhar, one of the world's leading
institutions of Islamic scholarship, spoke out against a meeting in
Cairo in December between Sheik Mohammed Sayyed Tantawi, the imam
of Al-Azhar, and Israel's chief rabbi, Yisrael Lau.
	   The four clerics may be fired from their posts if found to have
acted improperly, the opposition Al-Ahrar newspaper said. Al-Azhar
officials did not comment on their possible punishment or the
content of the hearing Tuesday.
	   The clerics were involved in a group known as Al-Azhar Ulama
Front, which brought together militant clergymen inside Al-Azhar
opposed to the more moderate Tantawi. The government abolished the
front last month and seized its offices after it attacked Tantawi.
	   Tantawi has supported the peace process with Israel, although he
has condoned attacks by Islamic radicals against the Jewish state.
He has also supported organ transplants and the paying of interest
_ both issues hotly contested by other clerics.

Singapore opens exhibit focusing on tumultuous history

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore opened a much-publicized history
exhibit Tuesday to introduce the country's tumultuous past to its
sheltered younger generation, who are now witnessing regional
unrest for the first time.
	   The National Education Exhibition ``arose out of the
government's concern that many young Singaporeans are unaware of
our history,'' Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said at the opening
ceremony.
	   Using futuristic technology to explore the country's past, the
exhibit highlights the more violent episodes from Singapore's last
100 years, including tension and discord with neighbors Malaysia
and Indonesia in the past decades.
	   Singapore faced a significant communist uprising and labor
unrest in the 1950s. Violent race riots rocked the multi-ethnic
Southeast Asian city in the 1960s, while terrorist bombings also
scarred the city in the decades after World War II.
	   It merged with neighboring Malaysia in 1963, only to be expelled
two years later.
	   All of this is a far cry from today's Singapore, where huge,
air-conditioned malls beckon hordes of well-heeled young shoppers
bent on making money _ lots of it.
	   Multimedia shows are combined with live performances and
elaborate sets to produce some powerful scenes.
	   About 500,000 Singaporeans _ mainly schoolchildren _ will visit
the ambitious exhibit, which was in the planning stages for two
years and cost 10 million Singapore dollars (dlrs 5.9 million). The
exhibit will run until the end of the month.
	   It displays for the first time previously secret documents and
weapons confiscated by the Internal Security Department. The
clandestine department is responsible for detaining subversives in
this rigorously controlled city-state of 3.1 million people.
	   The exhibit comes at a time when Singapore's relations with its
neighbors have become more strained, and Asia's profound economic
uncertainty is threatening to disrupt the fragile balance of
politics and security in the region.
	   Ties with Indonesia deteriorated after Singapore patriarch Lee
Kuan Yew indirectly criticized B.J. Habibie, before the feisty
technocrat took over the presidency of the world's fourth most
populous nation in May.
	   Racial tension erupted in Indonesia during the recent uprising.
Shops owned by Chinese merchants were systematically looted and
Chinese women raped.
	   To the north, Malaysia remains a constant source of tension for
tiny Singapore.
	   The two countries continue to claim an island near their shores,
while the fate of Malaysian railway land in Singapore remains
unresolved after years of discussions. Singapore's dependence on
Malaysian water is also a sensitive issue.
	   Prime Minister Goh urged Singaporeans to be prepared ``so that
if they ever again have to face formidable odds, they will hold
together and defend the prosperous economy and harmonious society
that their forefathers built.''
	   Singapore's ``vulnerabilities and constraints will always be
there,'' he added.

World Cup too long, says FIFA chief Blatter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ The length of soccer's World Cup needs
to be cut, new FIFA President Sepp Blatter said in an interview
published Tuesday.
	   ``In the opening phase, teams had six days between matches,''
Blatter was quoted as saying in the Bern daily Der Bund. ``That's
too many. It shouldn't be longer than four days.''
	   He conceded there was a danger of viewers being saturated with
soccer if matches were played closer together, but that the danger
``also exists if the World Cup lasts for 33 days.''
	   ``There's no question that changes must be made in the sale of
tickets,'' Blatter continued, but he did not specify what changes
might be considered. Ticket scandals have dogged the World Cup
finals in France.
	   Blatter hinted that he will soon step down from the committee
bidding for the 2006 Winter Olympics to come to Switzerland.
	   Blatter, 62, is one of the most prominent campaigners for the
bid to host the games in Sion, in his native state of Valais.
	   ``A double function in FIFA and Sion 1996 doesn't seem possible
any more,'' he was quoted as saying. ``But I will continue to
support the application in some form.''
	   The new FIFA chief denied he has promised the 2006 World Cup
finals to Africa, but said a rotation system among America, Europe,
Asia and Africa is ``logical.''
	   Africa ``needs to be able to offer the necessary structures'' if
it is to be awarded the tournament, Blatter said.
	   He promised unity on the world soccer body's ruling Executive
Committee and said UEFA President Lennart Johansson, whom Blatter
defeated last month for the FIFA presidency after a bitterly fought
contest, would become one of his ``closest contacts.''
	   ``We're going into the future together now,'' Blatter said.

Marshall returns, Lomu axed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; ADDS quotes, details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ All Black wing Jonah Lomu was axed
for the second time in his 22-test career Tuesday and faces a
future as an impact player off the bench.
	   While New Zealand welcomed back scrum-half Justin Marshall after
just one match since tearing his Achilles tendon in March, the
selectors dropped out of form winger Lomu and replaced the 1995
World Cup star with Joeli Viridi.
	   Lomu missed most of last season's tests with a rare kidney
disorder. He returned on the tour of Britain and recently played
the opening two tests against England ahead of Saturday's first
tri-nations test against Australia in Melbourne.
	   Lomu was below his best in the 40-10 second test win over the
English and was replaced late in the game by Viridi, who scored a
try.
	   ``Joeli deserves his opportunity and in the way he plays the
game this is an opportunity for him,'' said All Blacks coach John
Hart. ``It is an important decision to leave out Jonah but (he) had
a very poor game (against England) by his own admission and I think
if he was to come off the bench he would be very effective.''
	   Hart said if Lomu was to be picked on the bench for the
Melbourne game there was a chance that would provide back-up for
both the loose forwards as well as the backs.
	   Under new international regulations allowing more use of
replacements, Australia has also experimented with specialist
impact players. Giant loose forward Willie Ofahenguae is one player
whose international career has been extended by the rule change.
	   Viridi's inclusion adds further inexperience to a fresh All
Blacks lineup missing Sean Fitzpatrick, Zinzan Brooke and Frank
Bunce from the all-conquering tri-nations teams of the past two
seasons.
	   Vidiri can suffer handling problems and, like Lomu, his
defensive alignment is suspect.
	   Hart received a setback in Tuesday morning's session when center
Mark Mayerhofler suffered a hamstring injury and was forced out of
contention.
	   Veteran center Walter Little is still in doubt with a foot
injury and Carlos Spencer has been selected on standby if Little
fails to improve.
	   ``In Walter's case, because he is easily the most experienced
midfielder and because he's very important to us, we might delay
any decision until much later in the week,'' Hart said. ``He's one
player I would take over and wait and see. He's just got huge
experience; when you've lost Frank Bunce, you wouldn't want to lose
Walter Little as well _ he played so well in that first test with
England.
	   ``So if he can be ready by Saturday, then I'm prepared to delay
that decision as long as I have to, even until the day itself.''
	   Hart will take a squad of 24 to Melbourne on Wednesday but will
not finalize his reserves until later in the week.
	   Australia has won all three tests so far this season while New
Zealand swept England 2-0. South Africa is the third team in the
annual round-robin tournament.
	   New Zealand team:
	   Christian Cullen, Jeff Wilson, Scott McLeod, Walter Little or
Carlos Spencer, Joeli Vidiri, Andrew Mehrtens, Justin Marshall,
Taine Randell (captain), Josh Kronfeld, Robin Brooke, Ian Jones,
Michael Jones, Olo Brown, Anton Oliver, Craig Dowd.

Separatist protesters raise rebel flag in Indonesian province
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details on protest Tuesday &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of separatist protesters,
some carrying arrows, spears and daggers, demonstrated Tuesday
against Indonesian control of the remote province of Irian Jaya.
	   Social workers, meanwhile, said a pro-independence activist who
was shot in a separate rally Monday had died in a hospital.
	   Protests have been building in Irian Jaya, where a small group
of separatist rebels operates. Activists have been emboldened by
political reforms sweeping Indonesia in the wake of the May
resignation of authoritarian President Suharto.
	   However, the government is unwilling to consider independence
for mineral-rich Irian Jaya, a former Dutch colony that was taken
over by Indonesia in 1963. The province in eastern Indonesia
comprises the western half of New Guinea.
	   In the highland town of Wamena, hundreds of protesters rallied
Tuesday at the local government building and hoisted a flag of a
guerrilla band called the Free Papua Movement.
	   Some of the protesters carried traditional weapons such as
daggers and spears, the official Antara news agency quoted army Lt.
Col. Herry Risdiyanto as saying. There were no reports of violence.
	   On Monday, troops in the town of Biak fired rubber bullets at
demonstrators who had refused to lower a rebel flag.
	   Ruben Orboy, a man in his late 20s, was hit in the head and died
of his wound later Monday, said an official with the Indonesian Red
Cross. He requested anonymity.
	   Earlier, the Indonesian military denied unconfirmed reports that
up to seven protesters were killed. That claim came from the
Australia West Papua Association, a Sydney-based group of
supporters of independence for the province.
	   Two dozen people were injured in the clash. About 180 people
were arrested, but most of them have been released.
	   Biak lies 3,200 kilometers (2,000 miles) northeast of Jakarta,
the Indonesian capital.
	   Last week, demonstrators battled security forces in Jayapura,
the capital of Irian Jaya. One police officer who was beaten by
protesters died in a hospital this past weekend, and two students
who were shot remain in critical condition.
	   The separatist movement in Irian Jaya is not as widespread as
the campaign for independence in East Timor, where anti-Indonesian
protesters have demonstrated in recent weeks. Indonesia invaded the
former Portuguese colony in 1975 and annexed it a year later.

Assad names new intelligence chief, prepares for more changes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Syrian President Hafez Assad has reportedly
named a new head for the country's powerful intelligence service, a
week after he dismissed the former director.
	   Assad fired Maj. Gen. Bashir al-Najar. Arab newspapers quoting
official sources said the general was suspected of corruption and
accused of negligence of duty. Assad also pensioned off Gen. Hikmat
Al-Shihabi, his army chief of staff.
	   Assad named as his new intelligence chief Maj. Gen. Mahmoud
al-Saqqa, a veteran army officer who participated in the U.S.-led
international coalition that drove Iraqi troops out of Kuwait in
the 1991 Gulf War, Syrian sources and Arab diplomats said Tuesday,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The moves may be a prelude to wider changes in the government
and the ruling Baath party, including a higher army position for
his son Bashar, they said by telephone.
	   Bashar, a British-trained ophthalmologist, has reportedly been
groomed by Assad for his succession following the death of his
brother Basil in a car crash in 1994.
	   Bashar was expected to be promoted to the rank of army colonel
and named as head of the Regional Command of the Baath Party, the
highest decision-making body in Syria, the diplomats said. Bashar
has a military rank of lieutenant colonel and is commander-in-chief
of the Republican Guards.
	   Syrian opposition leaders in Europe said Assad was preparing the
ground for Bashar's succession in case he dies. Assad, 68, has
diabetes and suffered a heart attack in 1983, although his grip on
power remains firm.

Hong Kong share prices close generally mixed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices in Hong Kong closed generally
mixed in extremely thin trading Tuesday.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
fell 39.94 points, or 0.4 percent, to 8,444.18. On Monday, the
index had slumped 155.19 points.
	   Turnover fell to 2.95 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 378
million) from Monday's 3.12 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
400 million).
	   Brokers said share prices opened slightly higher, but the key
index slipped in the last hour of trading in the absence of any
positive news.
	   They said many investors were waiting to see what measures the
Japanese government would take to boost that country's sagging
economy after parliamentary elections on Sunday.
	   Among losers, Swire Pacific ``A'' fell 1.60 Hong Kong dollars to
27.55, Cheung Kong fell 70 Hong Kong cents to 36.70, and Hang Seng
Bank fell 30 cents to 43.00.
	   Among gainers, Hang Lung Development rose 25 cents to 7.95, and
Hong Kong Telecom rose 5 cents to 15.10.
	   Remaining unchanged was HSBC Holdings at 187.50.

Swissair strikes up alliance with Japan Airlines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss national airline Swissair has
formed a partnership with Japan Airlines, the companies said in a
joint statement Tuesday.
	   The two firms say the agreement will offer customers a better
service pattern, improved connections and more sales outlets around
the world. It will also improve the frequency of the airlines'
Switzerland to Japan routes, the statement said.
	   The collaboration will extend into other fields such as
catering, luggage handling and aircraft maintenance.
	   ``It's going to give all our customers real and tangible
benefits, and it's going to enhance the profitability of both
partners, too,'' said Swissair Group Chief Executive Officer
Philippe Bruggisser.
	   The partnership represents the latest move by Swissair towards
developing a wide network of alliances with other airlines.
	   Last week, it agreed a partnership with Hong Kong based carrier
Cathay Pacific.
	   Swissair already has alliances with Delta Airlines in the United
States, Austrian Airlines, Belgium's Sabena, Air Portugal, Turkish
Airlines and AOM of France.

Wakanohana picks up third victory by default
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAGOYA, Japan (AP) _ New yokozuna (grand champion) Wakanohana
picked up his third victory by default Tuesday as his injured
opponent, Kotonishiki, pulled out of the 15-day Nagoya Grand Sumo
Tournament.
	   Yokozuna Takanohana and ozeki (champion) Musashimaru also
remained undefeated at 3-0, while yokozuna Akebono and ozeki
Takanonami both improved to 2-1.
	   Takanohana fought off No. 2 maegashira (senior wrestler)
Musoyama's driving attempts at the ring's edge and tossed him down,
leaving Musoyama at 1-2.
	   Yokozuna Akebono, or Chad Rowan from Hawaii, was jolted by
winless No. 1 maegashira Oginishiki's arm throw attempt, but fought
back and sent out his foe.
	   Komusubi (junior champion second class) Kotonishiki pulled out
because of injuries to his right thigh suffered in his loss to
Takanohana on Monday.
	   Musashimaru, or Fiamalu Penitani from Hawaii, charged komusubi
Kaio (0-3) with an arm throw attempt and sent him out from behind.
	   Ozeki Takanonami forced out No. 3 maegashira Gojoro (0-3) for
his second victory against one defeat.
	   No. 11 maegashira Kyokushuzan, or Mongolian Batbayar Davaa,
suffered his second defeat against one victory as he was thrown
down by No. 9 maegashira Kotonowaka (2-1).
	   No. 15 maegashira Kyokutenho, or Mongolian Tsevegnyam Nyamjav,
toppled No. 14 maegashira Kaiho with an arm throw, leaving both at
1-2.
	   In makushita, the top junior division, No. 10-ranked
Hoshiandesu, or Argentine Jose Antonio Juarez, slapped down No.
8-ranked Yachi for his second victory against no defeats.
	   No. 9-ranked Yamato, or American George Kalima, has been kept
out of this tournament by illness.
	   Yamato was demoted to the makushita division from the senior
juryo division for his 1-14 record in the previous tournament in
May.
	   In sandanme, the second-highest junior division, No. 17-ranked
Kyokutenzan, or Mongolian Enkhbat Batmunkha, forced out No.
16-ranked Tenichi and remained undefeated at 2-0.
	   Wrestlers in junior divisions have only seven bouts during the
15-day tournament.

U.S. delegation urged to meet with Nigerian opposition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS 3 graf after 2nd graf pvs, `The State ...' to ADD
debate over release timing of Moshood Abiola. Edits thereafter to
conform. &QL; 
 &UR; By GILBERT DA COSTA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ A high-level U.S. diplomatic delegation
was scheduled to meet with Nigeria's new military ruler with the
aim of restoring relations broken off years ago because of this
West African nation's abysmal human rights record.
	   The State Department's third-ranking official Thomas Pickering,
a former ambassador to Nigeria, led the U.S. delegation scheduled
to meet Tuesday with Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar in the capital of
Abuja.
	   The visit comes as Nigeria's military continues to debate the
proposed release of the country's best-known political prisoner,
Moshood Abiola.
	   The state-controlled Times newspaper said Tuesday that Abiola's
immediate release had been delayed while the ruling military
considers his political future. Abiola, the apparent winner of
1993's annulled presidential elections, was jailed the following
year and accused of treason.
	   He would have been released last week during a visit by United
Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, but for ``uncertainties about
Abiola's conduct after the release,'' the Times reported, quoting
unnamed government officials.
	   Dissidents have complained that Annan and other diplomats
refused to stand up for Abiola.
	   Pickering ``must avoid being closeted in Abuja like the United
Nations Secretary-General and his Commonwealth counterpart who
failed to meet credible opposition groups,'' National Democratic
Coalition Secretary-General Ayo Okpadokun said in a statement
released in Lagos.
	   The U.S. delegation will not visit Lagos, Nigeria's commercial
capital where much of the country's opposition movement is
centered. However, the delegation will hold a small meeting with
various members of civil society, including some opposition
figures, said Charles Patterson, the principal officer at the U.S.
Embassy office in Abuja.
	   Annan's visit last week infuriated many of the country's
dissidents, who have accused him of putting pressure on Abiola to
renounce his claim to the presidency.
	   Abiola told Annan that he would give up his presidential claims.
	   There have been reports that Abiola will be freed this week,
after a 30-day mourning period for Nigeria's former dictator ends
Tuesday.
	   During his visit, Annan announced that Nigeria would free all
its political prisoners ``at the appropriate time,'' including
Abiola.
	   However, the uproar from Nigeria's opposition since Annan's
announcement may mean that Abiola will end up spending more time in
his guest house-prison. Some Nigerian officials have said that he
will be held longer, apparently because the government fears
opposition anger spilling over into political violence.
	   Abubakar came to power last month after the death of Gen. Sani
Abacha, whose five-year-dictatorship left Nigeria an international
pariah.
	   American-Nigerian relations have been poor in recent years _
though American firms do purchase millions of dollars worth of
Nigerian oil every year _ particularly after Abacha executed
playwright and pro-democracy activist Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other
people in November 1995.
	   However, Abubakar has surprised and pleased the United States by
releasing some political prisoners and pledging that all will be
freed.
	   ``There is a moment of opportunity here,'' State Department
spokesman James P. Rubin said last week in announcing Pickering's
visit.

	   PAMPLONA, Spain (AP) _ One Spaniard was gored in the groin and
another trampled by crowds during the famed running of the bulls in
the annual San Fermin festival on Tuesday.
	   Hundreds of people raced through cobblestone streets in this
northern Spanish town to stay ahead of 16 bulls and steers. The
850-meter (935-yard) run started at 8 a.m. (0600 GMT) and was over
in less than three minutes.
	   Thousands of Spaniards and foreigners flock to Pamplona each
year for the nine-day festival that kicked off Monday. The
celebrations, whose highlight is the morning bull-run and
associated revelry, was immortalized in Ernest Hemingway's 1927
novel ``The Sun Also Rises.''
	   Injuries are frequent _ and death a constant risk _ during the
bull-runs.
	   Juanxto Gazpio Irujo, 22, of Pamplona, was said to be in stable
condition after being gored on Tuesday. Daniel Cascante Hernandez,
whose age was unavailable, suffered back injuries when he fell and
was trampled by people running behind him.
	   The last fatality was a 22-year-old American gored to death in
1995. Thirteen people have died at the event since officials began
keeping records in 1924.
	   The bulls participating in the Pamplona run are killed in
bullfights later in the day.
	   Historians say daredevils flaunting authority began running with
the bulls four centuries ago.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Striking coal miners blocked traffic on the
Trans-Siberian railway for the fifth day Tuesday, while miners in
the far north joined the protests and also halted a rail line.
	   Trains are now stranded in several places along the
Trans-Siberian, with industry in the Tomsk region ground to a halt
because the area's one link to the railway has been blocked, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Several hundred miners in the central Siberian mining town of
Anzhero-Sudzhensk began the protest Friday over government plans to
close mines and reduce subsidies to local coal-related industries.
	   Negotiations between miners and the government have been
unsuccessful. Protesters have been demanding that Vice Premier Oleg
Sysuyev come to the region to review a settlement that ended a
similar blockade in May. The miners claim the government is not
paying the back wages it promised in the agreement.
	   Meanwhile, miners in the northern region of Komi have similar
complaints and began blocking a rail line on Tuesday, news reports
said.
	   But Sysuyev has said a meeting will not take place until the
miners lift the blockades.
	   The latest protest has resulted in an estimated 7 million rubles
(dlrs 1.2 million) in losses, Oleg Moshenko, the deputy railway
minister, was quoted as saying by ITAR-Tass.
	   The Russian Independent Miners Union said Tuesday that nearly
60,000 miners have taken part in protests across Russia since the
start of the year, Interfax reported.
	   Russia has been gradually shutting down loss-making coal mines.
But some mines are the lone source of employment in isolated
regions, and fired miners have difficulty finding new work.

Thai finance chief expects IMF will allow greater deficit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund,
overseeing a dlrs 17.2 billion rescue fund for the Thai economy, is
expected to ease the loan conditions to help stimulate growth, Thai
Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda said Tuesday.
	   Tarrin told Dow Jones Newswires that a planned 25 billion baht
(dlrs 604 million) deficit in the 825 billion baht (dlrs 19.9
billion) government budget for the year to Sept. 30, 1999, could be
expanded to provide additional stimulus to a contracting economy.
	   The IMF is aware that the economic downturn's severity calls for
a more expansionary deficit than the currently mandated 0.5 percent
of gross domestic product, Tarrin said in a telephone interview.
	   ``In principle, we have agreed already,'' he said.
	   An IMF team is to arrive in Bangkok in the first week of August
for talks on guidelines for the rescue package during its fifth
quarter of implementation.
	   In May, the Thai government _ acknowledging that the country's
economy is faring worse than expected _ sought a relaxation of
lending terms. For the first time, it asked for permission to run a
larger budget deficit in fiscal 1998 and to spend more on aid for
the poor.
	   It said the economy may shrink as much as 5.5 percent this year,
compared with an initial forecast for a 3.5 percent contraction.
	   Tarrin said the deficit in state enterprise investment could
also be adjusted to help boost the economy.
	   Thailand's once-booming economy ground to a halt last year when
the financial sector faced liquidity problems that exposed massive
debts. Further economic turmoil resulted after the central bank
devalued the baht.
	   The first of Asia's miracle economies to stumble into crisis
last year, Thailand is now regarded as a regional model of economic
reform. Stock prices and the currency have stabilized.
	   But unemployment is rising, with more than 2 million expected to
be jobless in 1998, an increase of more than 60 percent from a year
earlier.
	   Some economists have expressed concern that the original
conditions imposed by the IMF were too strict, and crippled any
chance of an economic recovery by throttling growth.
	   To help stimulate the economy, the government recently has also
been moving to ease monetary policy, with the central bank slowly
pushing down interest rates that last month were around 19 percent.
	   Other measures to boost liquidity and restore the flow of cash
and credit include global bond issues of up to dlrs 5 billion over
fiscal 1998-2000. But an initial offering of dlrs 1 billion to dlrs
2 billion, originally planned for June, is still awaiting favorable
market conditions, the government said Monday.

Polish village inherits dlrs 1 million
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A Polish woman who made a fortune in real
estate in North America has left dlrs 1 million to her tiny home
town in Poland, village officials said Tuesday.
	   After more than 50 years of living abroad, Marianna Miletich
returned in the late 1980s to her home in Kraszewice, a village of
about 900 people some 270 kilometers (167 miles) southwest of
Warsaw.
	   When she died in January 1997 at age 82, village officials
learned she had willed them dlrs 1 million.
	   A foundation was set up last month with the money, which will be
used to build a school, a purification plant and refuse dump and to
buy a school bus, said Stanislaw Plewinski, the secretary of the
village office.

Stomach diseases spread in North Korea as hungry eat grass
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Struggling to survive three years of food
shortages by eating grass, bark and roots, North Koreans weakened
by hunger are falling ill to stomach diseases, an aid official said
Tuesday.
	   Months of meager government food rations, and in some places a
complete lack of food, have forced many North Koreans to scrounge
for anything to eat, said Kathi Zellweger of Caritas, who left the
communist country Tuesday morning.
	   During a weeklong inspection tour of the Catholic relief group's
aid programs, Zellweger saw continued devastation from the years of
famine. Water sources remain scarce and tainted from last year's
drought. Hospitals have little medicine or food. Doctors reported
an increase in diarrhea and stomach ailments.
	   ``This is more of a problem because they are trying to produce
food out of everything that is edible _ herbs, grass, roots,
anything,'' said Zellweger.
	   On her last trip in May, she took samples of those alternative
foods and had them analyzed.
	   ``The results were shocking,'' she said. ``The human body is
just not capable of digesting this kind of food.''
	   Although officials did not report any deaths to Zellweger,
doctors have previously told aid workers that the famine and lack
of medicine meant once easily curable diseases were killing North
Koreans.
	   Run by the world's last Stalinist government that officially
preaches self-reliance, North Korea is now largely dependent on
international aid. North Korean officials, working with U.N.
experts, have estimated that aid, amounting to at least dlrs 300
million, would be needed for at least the next three years.
	   A three-year recovery program, discussed at a U.N.-sponsored
donor's meeting in Geneva in May, did not make clear whether North
Korea would move away from collective farming practices. Two years
of flooding followed by last year's drought pushed chronic
mismanagement of agriculture into full blown famine.
	   Despite the need for assistance, Zellweger found signs of
progress. A U.N.-backed double-cropping program of winter wheat and
spring barley, harvested last month, has put 100,000-150,000 tons
of food into the bare distribution system.
	   While the amount is a fraction of the 4.5 million tons of grain
North Korea needs at a minimum to feed its 22 million people,
Zellweger said the food will help North Koreans through the lean
summer months before the fall harvest.
	   Conditions for the summer corn and rice crops look good, but
given the past three years experience, North Koreans are worried
about the weather in July and August, Zellweger said. She oversaw
the delivery of 18,000 tons of Canadian wheat and yellow peas and
1,000 tons of Malaysian palm oil.
	   ``People are just struggling along,'' said Zellweger. ``It's
mind-boggling. Every bit of land is planted with vegetables,
potatoes or maize. Sometimes you can hardly see the farmhouses
because there's maize around the whole building.''

No more political asylum in France for Romanian citizens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ France will no longer give political
asylum to Romanian citizens because their country is now considered
democratic, the French Embassy said Tuesday.
	   Romania has the highest number of citizens requesting political
asylum in France. Although no total figures were available on
Tuesday, embassy spokeswoman Miruna Oancea said some 25 percent of
all requests come from Romanian citizens.
	   From 1983 to 1996, about 440,000 Romanians and more than 110,000
Bulgarians sought asylum in Europe.
	   Each week 20-30 Romanians are deported by French authorities.
Most of them are illegal immigrants. Romanians need a visa to visit
France and other Western European countries.
	   Romania threw off communism in a bloody revolt in 1989. However,
democratic rights were slow to come. Ethnic minorities,
particularly Gypsies, or Roma, claim they are persecuted.
Homosexuals also assert that discriminatory laws make them eligible
for asylum.
	   Last November, however, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
said democratic progress in Romania and Bulgaria excluded nationals
from either country from applying for refugee status.

IMF predicts lower economic growth for Philippines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund
expects economic growth in the Philippines will fail to meet the
government's current target in 1998, an official said Tuesday.
	   Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said the IMF expects the
Philippines' gross national product to grow by less than 2.5
percent this year, even lower than the 2.5 to 3.0 percent revised
growth target proposed by an interagency Development Budget
Coordinating Council. The council consists of economic, finance and
monetary officials.
	   The IMF based its lower GNP growth projection on the
``worse-than-expected'' adverse effects of the El Nino weather
phenomenon on the country's agricultural production, he said.
	   The country has also been battered by the effects of Asia's
currency crisis, although it has been hurt less seriously than some
of its neighbors that have slipped into recession.
	   Espiritu declined to specify the exact GNP growth projected by
the IMF for the Philippines this year. This, he said, will be
disclosed later when the government officially adopts its new GNP
growth target.
	   The government's initial GNP growth projection for the year was
between 3 and 4 percent.
	   Espiritu also said the IMF is ``keen on maintaining a
single-digit inflation rate target'' for the year. He declined to
explain further.
	   The government currently expects the country's average inflation
to settle within a range of 9.4 to 10.0 percent for the year, up
from an initial projection of 7.5 to 8.5 percent. Inflation
registered 10.7 percent in June on a year-to-year basis.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Senior officials held urgent talks Tuesday to
try to solve glitches that have marred the opening of Hong Kong's
huge new airport by leaving passengers waiting for bags, stuck on
planes or wondering where their flight was.
	   Computer problems caused flight delays at Chek Lap Kok airport
for a second day, but the number of passengers affected wasn't
known.
	   ``The computer went down and lost track of some flight
information,'' said Chris Donnolly, an Airport Authority spokesman.
	   Computer glitches also caused delays in baggage handling and
flight information. Donnolly said passengers had to wait 20-30
minutes for their bags, which he termed ``not desirable, but not
unacceptable.''
	   Some passengers had to wait ``till the early hours'' Tuesday for
their baggage, Donnolly said.
	   By late afternoon, mechanical problems in air bridges and
docking areas still were not fixed, he said.
	   The new airport, built on reclaimed land on a remote outlying
island, was opened Monday to replace venerable Kai Tak, famous for
its roof-skimming approaches over congested urban areas.
	   Airport officials dismissed charges of planning errors and said
minor problems were expected in the early days of operation. About
80,000 passengers and 220 flights used the airport Monday. Another
100,000 residents visited the airport, Donnolly said.
	   Chief Secretary Anson Chan, Hong Kong's top civil servant, and
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang met with Airport Authority
officials to sort out the problems.
	   ``What we want to do is prevent small problems from building up
into big problems,'' Chan said. She added that the problems did not
affect the airport's safety.
	   She said the government was in contact with airline
representatives about the problems.
	   Clinton Leeks, the authority's corporate development director,
said there was only so much testing of the system that could be
done before the airport opened.
	   ``No matter how many trials you do, you can't duplicate the
effect of 70,000 to 80,000 people just coming day after day after
day with a very short respite during a brief overnight period,'' he
said on Radio Hong Kong.
	   Hong Kong newspapers gave the airport opening mixed reviews.
	   Some passengers waited for two hours inside planes before they
could disembark because there were not enough staff and tarmac
buses, while others waited for hours Monday evening for their
baggage, the papers reported.
	   ``Even when we move house, we encounter many trivial problems
that cause inconvenience, let alone such a massive operation as
moving the airport,'' Apple Daily said in an editorial.
	   Ming Pao, another Chinese daily, said some problems are
inevitable, but the airport authority must explain them. It said,
``We can't jump to a conclusion and blame the authority for
inadequate planning.''
	   Oriental Daily News said the problems showed that the airport
wasn't ready for operation.
	   ``People's safety is at stake. The transition between the old
and new airport should have been perfect,'' it said.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police battling ethnic Albanian
insurgents near one of Kosovo's largest cities gained ground
against the rebels after overnight battles, Serb sources reported
Tuesday.
	   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said fighting
in the region near the southwestern city of Pec appeared to be
continuing Tuesday. But with phone lines cut and the main road into
the area sealed off by Serb police, the report could not be
verified.
	   The fighting flared Monday, with the ethnic-Albanian-run Kosovo
Information Center reporting one person killed and three wounded by
heavy shelling of Lodja village, near Pec.
	   Serb sources said armed Albanians opened fire on Serb villagers,
forcing a Serb counterattack.
	   The pro-government Serb Media Center reported two policemen
killed and six others wounded in the fighting at Lodja.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo since Serb forces
launched a crackdown on ethnic Albanian militants on Feb. 28.
Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in the disputed province, which
Serbs consider an integral part of their history and culture.
Serbia is the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   Recent attempts to bring ethnic Albanian leaders and the
Yugoslav government to the negotiating table have produced few
results. Western diplomats fear the violence could erupt into a
wider Balkan war.
	   Closer to Pristina, tensions were high in the 3,000-member
community of Pirane, 75 kilometers (45 miles) southwest of the
provincial capital, following the burials of three ethnic Albanian
farmers.
	   Official Serb reports said the three were murdered by their own
people for betraying them. But the villagers say the slayings are
the handiwork of Serb police.
	   A tangle of roadblocks have prevented any outside observers from
confirming reports of fighting, and information is largely
channeled through centers representing either side.
	   The contradictory allegations highlight the conflicting
propaganda in Serbia's Kosovo province. Western diplomats hope to
dispel the confusion with the launch this week of a multinational
observer mission.
	   Western observers, Belgrade-based diplomats from the United
States, Russia, Poland and the European Union will regularly tour
villages in Kosovo to try and clarify the situation on the ground.
	   They also will share information with humanitarian organizations
struggling to cope with a flood of refugees and conflicts in the
remote Kosovo mountains where neighboring Serb and ethnic Albanian
villages form a checkerboard of front lines.

Prince ends coup commemoration with call for peace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Prince Norodom Ranariddh called for
peace Tuesday as he concluded ceremonies commemorating Cambodians
killed in last year's coup, which deposed him as co-prime minister.
	   Ranariddh, allowed to return by strongman Hun Sen to contest
elections July 26, noted that the takeover was the latest chapter
of violence in Cambodia since his father, King Norodom Sihanouk,
was toppled in a U.S.-backed coup in 1970.
	   ``I would like to call for peace like we had during the Sangkum
Reastr Niyum regime,'' said the prince, referring to Sihanouk's
rule in the 1950s and '60s before war in neighboring Vietnam
engulfed Cambodia.
	   The coup against his father fueled the rise of the Khmer Rouge,
which won a civil war in 1975 and imposed a reign of terror that
caused the deaths of as many as 2 million people before it was
deposed in 1979 by an invasion from Vietnam.
	   A decade of harsh occupation by Vietnam, Cambodia's historic
enemy, and civil war with a Khmer Rouge-dominated resistance that
included Ranariddh followed.
	   U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993 were supposed to usher in a new
era of peace and democracy. Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC won but
Hun Sen, a former Khmer Rouge who ruled during the 1980s under
Vietnam's mantel, forced his way into a coalition.
	   Four years of tensions worsened by attempts by both sides to
recruit thousands of war-weary ex-Khmer Rouge guerrillas to their
respective armed camps erupted in pitched fighting July 5-6, 1997.
	   After nine months in exile, Ranariddh was allowed to return to
Cambodia to participate in the July 26 parliamentary elections. Hun
Sen has been accused of using murder and fear and of stacking the
electoral process in his favor.
	   Though his reference Tuesday to Sihanouk's regime appeared aimed
at winning votes, the prince said he did not want to speak of
politics but to remember lives lost.
	   As many as 100 of his supporters were executed by Hun Sen's
forces in the months that followed last year's coup. There have
been no arrests in any of those killings.
	   The prince said that in addition to those killed during the
coup, as many as 600 of his soldiers were killed in factional
fighting in later months, including eight generals.
	   After he was ousted, the prince formed an armed resistance in
northern Cambodia to oppose the Hun Sen government. A cease-fire
was negotiated three months ago.

Russian markets plummet yet again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian financial markets suffered another heavy
hit on Tuesday, forcing the Central Bank to intervene to prop up
the Russian currency.
	   The Russian stock market was down more than 7 percent by midday
and interest rates on shot-term government bonds shot up to 120
percent, from an 90 percent on Monday.
	   Also, the ruble began to fall, and the Central Bank stepped in
quickly in an effort to prop up the currency.
	   Russian markets have been wracked by turmoil in recent months
due to the government's shaky finances, the drop in world oil
prices and the spillover from the Asian economic crisis.
	   The stock market has lost more than half its value this year and
the interest rates on government bonds have soared to unsustainable
levels.
	   But so far the problems have been limited to the markets and
have had little effect on ordinary Russians. The government's
greatest fear is that the currency will fall, which would increase
prices and directly effect all Russians.
	   Russia is seeking a loan of at least dlrs 10 billion from the
International Monetary Fund to stabilize its markets.
	   An IMF team is in Moscow for the second week for talks on the
additional lending. Foreign investors have been fleeing Russia and
are unlikely to return until the government can stabilize the
markets.
	   ``Everybody is just sitting there, not knowing what's going to
come next,'' said Sergei Babayan, a bond trader at the Moscow
brokerage Troika-Dialog.

Indonesia's ruling party scrambles to redefine its role
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's ruling party will dissolve
a leadership council headed by former President Suharto at a
congress this week, a party official said Tuesday.
	   The Golkar party is struggling to redefine itself in the wake of
the May resignation of Suharto, who used the party as a vehicle to
cement his 32-year, authoritarian rule.
	   Suharto quit amid turmoil fueled by Indonesia's economic crisis
and ensuing discontent with the once unchallenged leader. He
relinquished power soon after an estimated 1,200 people died in
riots over price increases in Jakarta, the capital.
	   His protege and successor, President B.J. Habibie, has pledged
general elections next year that could threaten Golkar's majority
in the 500-seat Parliament.
	   Scrambling to keep up with democratic change, Golkar is trying
to shake its reputation as a haven for corrupt bureaucrats and has
vowed to reform itself in the July 9-11 congress.
	   Suharto is still technically patron of the party, but his role
is expected to fade. Delegates will disband the powerful Guidance
Council that he heads, said Waskito Reksosudirjo, the party's
chairman of political affairs.
	   Golkar was nurtured by Suharto to give his mandate a democratic
veneer. It steered his election through a special assembly for
seven, five-year terms.
	   Now the party appears to be splintering, with several factions
divided over how to pursue the new agenda of reform.
	   It is unclear what the party plans to do about the senior
leadership roles held by two of Suharto's children, eldest daughter
Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana and second son Bambang Trihatmodjo.

Protestants attack police over Portadown Orangemen's blocked march
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Blair meeting Orangemen, detail on
violence, political reax, Drumcree color; trims pvs
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Protestants determined to
overturn a ban on an Orange Order march threatened police overnight
in Belfast with bullets, rocks, gasoline bombs and grenades in the
most serious street violence since April's peace agreement.
	   The second night of mob violence late Monday and early Tuesday
followed repeated appeals from leaders of the Orange Order,
Northern Ireland's conservative Protestant brotherhood, for people
to demonstrate peacefully against Sunday's ban on their annual
march through the main Catholic section of Portadown, 30 miles (50
kms) southwest of Belfast.
	   Britain's minister responsible for governing Northern Ireland,
Mo Mowlam, appealed for Orangemen ``to recognize that there are
sinister elements who are using their protest to attack the
security forces.''
	   In London, Prime Minister Tony Blair's office announced he would
meet an Orange delegation there, possibly Wednesday, but stressed
that the possible negotiation of a parade down Portadown's disputed
Garvaghy Road would not be on the agenda.
	   On Monday night, Orangemen established human blockades across
main roads and traveled in a convoy to Hillsborough, a picturesque
village midway between Portadown and Belfast, to mount a
round-the-clock ``Freedom Camp'' of protesters outside Mowlam's
castle residence.
	   Police came under rifle fire in three parts of Belfast as they
tried to stop drunken youths from hijacking cars and creating
flaming road barricades across the city.
	   Youths barraged a north Belfast police station with gasoline and
paint bombs, and threw a grenade at a passing police armored car.
	   In the predominantly Protestant castle town of Carrickfergus
north of Belfast, people threw 10 grenades at a police barracks,
and two more into the back yard of a policeman's home. They also
gasoline-bombed a bed-and-breakfast where 14 guests were staying.
	   ``My husband was fighting the fire with one extinguisher and I
ran up to get two more. We managed to get it out but it was very,
very dangerous,'' said the proprietor, Mandy Mulholland.
	   Gasoline bombs damaged the Holy Cross Catholic elementary school
in north Belfast. And in the overwhelmingly Protestant village of
Dromore southwest of Belfast, a Catholic priest's car was set on
fire, as was the gas station beside his home.
	   In 1996, police blocked the Orangemen before they could reach
Portadown's main Catholic section along Garvaghy Road, where
anti-Orange protesters have tried to block the march for the past
three years. But after four nights of Protestant rioting, police
caved in and forced the Orangemen down the road, a bitter outcome
that Blair and police chiefs insist won't happen this time.
	   Now, backed by British soldiers in armored personnel carriers,
police are patrolling Belfast in strength from dusk until dawn.
	   Orangemen in Portadown, dubbed ``the Vatican of Orangeism''
because of its symbolic importance as the birthplace of the
203-year-old group, have refused to negotiate with the Catholic
protesters. They say they'll camp out until authorities dismantle
the barbed-wire barricades blocking them from Garvaghy Road.
	   A few hundred Orangemen slept all night in their tents and awoke
to a blazing orange sunrise Tuesday outside Drumcree Anglican
church, where Portadown Orangemen were prevented Sunday from
marching farther.
	   In contrast to 1996, when riot police and Protestants clashed
violently at close quarters outside the church, this time the
Drumcree standoff has taken on a relaxed, even festive atmosphere.
Booths set up under a big tent sell burgers and baby's bibs that
declare, ``Born to walk the Garvaghy Road.''

Mobile phones rendered mum by Japanese jamming device
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHESTER DAWSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ So there you are at the theater or a concert, when
a stranger's mobile phone goes off. What do you do?
	   In Japan, you jam.
	   Seeing a potentially lucrative market in the legions of annoyed
audiences held defenseless by the shrill ring of mobile phones,
Japanese entrepreneurs are rushing to market devices that can jam
mobile phone signals.
	   But while the consumers are saying silence is golden, the
popularity of the jamming devices has Japanese authorities worried,
and has forced a crackdown to limit use _ or abuse _ of the
jammers.
	   Last month, the Ministry of Posts and Communications released a
tentative policy report restricting jamming devices to such public
places as ``theaters or concert halls where the degree of public
nuisance is significant.''
	   And even these facilities have to apply for a permit.
	   The ministry is concerned that if jammers become too widely
available, they could be used maliciously or wind up blocking
legitimate telephone signals.
	   Retailers admit the ministry's position has thrown a damper on
the budding jamming industry.
	   Nikkodo Co., a company specializing in karaoke equipment sales,
had marketed the jamming devices to coffee shops and hospitals
until the debut of newly restrictive regulations.
	   ``It was so popular, but it's an official decision so there's
not much we can do,'' said Nikkodo spokesman Makoto Onodera.
	   Other entrepreneurs are pushing on.
	   ``We've seen sales drop off a bit, but the impact hasn't been
that pronounced so far,'' said Hiromitsu Kawachi, an executive at
SIC Co.
	   Kawachi's small, Tokyo-based firm manufactures a device that
retails for 65,000 yen (dlrs 465). The company's device is mainly
for personal use _ and has a jamming range of only about 3 meters
(9.9 feet).
	   Japan has one of the biggest markets in the world for mobile
phones. Some 39 million Japanese had them as of June 1.
	   But the spread of mobile phones has also posed problems for a
society where etiquette is not to be abused lightly.
	   Many upscale restaurants hold a firm line against calls taken _
or dialed _ at the table. And the coming attractions segment at
Japanese movie theaters is almost always preceded by a warning to
switch off mobile phones.
	   Even Japan's fabled bullet trains began airing recorded messages
a few years ago asking passengers to refrain from using mobile
phones at their seats.
	   Instead, they are asked to use the area between cars.

Taiwan trade continues to slide in June
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's exports slid 8.2 percent to U.S.
dlrs 9.13 billion in June because of Asia's economic crisis, the
Finance Ministry reported Tuesday.
	   Imports dropped 10.6 percent from a year earlier to dlrs 8.62
billion as industries bought less raw material and spare parts
because of the export decline, the ministry said.
	   If the regional economic crisis continues, Taiwan's exports
could drop as much as 3.4 percent for 1998, which would be Taiwan's
first export contraction in 16 years, said Hsu Kuo-hsiung, a
ministry official.
	   Taiwan's exports to Japan sagged 25 percent in June, while
exports to Southeast Asian countries fell 29 percent, the ministry
said.
	   Taiwan registered a record trade deficit of dlrs 1.56 billion
with Japan in this year's first six months as Japan's economic
slowdown led to reduced demand for foreign goods, it said.
	   Also in June, exports to Hong Kong fell 11 percent to dlrs 2.16
billion as China, which imports Taiwanese goods through Hong Kong,
experienced slower economic growth.
	   But exports to the United States rose 1.6 percent to dlrs 2.41
billion in June because the Taiwan dollar's 20 percent decline in
value had made local goods more competitive, officials said.

	   LONDON (AP) _ The London and Frankfurt stock exchanges are
forming a strategic alliance that they hope eventually will lead to
a pan-European stock market, they announced Tuesday.
	   The two exchanges said they had signed a memorandum of
understanding that will ``harmonize the markets for their leading
securities and, ultimately, to develop a joint electronic trading
platform.''
	   Werner G. Seifert, chief executive of the Deutsche Borse, and
Gavin Casey, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, said
they planned ``a low-cost, efficient and accessible equity market
infrastructure to enable issuers, investors and market participants
to take full advantage of the opportunities arising from the
development of a pan-European capital market.''
	   The stock market chiefs said they were trying to make the rules
and technology of their markets more similar while creating ``the
nucleus of a single European stock market'' that is expected
eventually to involve other exchanges.
	   The stock exchanges hope to complete the first part of their
plan by the time Europe's single currency, the Euro, is introduced
in January. That would create one place to trade big German and
British companies that currently are issued on both markets.

Greene, Jones, Gebrselassie highlight strongest field
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ This year's Golden Gala athletics meet will be more
golden than usual.
	   Michael Johnson, Maurice Greene, Marion Jones and Haile
Gebrselassie are among a slew of Olympic and world titlists that
organizers said Tuesday are signed up for the July 14 event.
	   Armed with more prestige and prize money as part of the
International Amateur Athletic Federation's new six-meet Golden
League, officials have brought together the strongest top-to-bottom
field ever at Olympic Stadium.
	   ``The athletes are more willing to come now,'' Italian athletics
federation spokesman Francesco Liello said. ``In past years there
have been some quality events but others that were less
impressive.''
	   A year ago, Jones was full of potential and Golden Gala
organizers didn't even have the women's 100 meters on the program.
	   Now Jones comes to Rome as the 100 world champion and top-ranked
women's sprinter. She has been getting closer and closer to
Florence Griffith Joyner's world record of 10.49 seconds in the
dash _ a mark no longer thought untouchable _ and will be pushed by
world bronze medalist Savatheda Fynes here.
	   Greene matched his countrywoman's 100 title at the World
Championships in Athens, Greece, last August, and in Rome he will
line up against world 200 champion Ato Boldon and Tim Montgomery
(bronze in Athens).
	   Johnson heads a strong field in the 400, in which he owns two
world titles plus Olympic gold. Americans Antonio Pettigrew, Tyree
Washington and Jerome Young _ members of the 1,600 relay world
champion squad _ are entered.
	   In the longer distances, Gebrselassie will try to lower his
world record of 12 minutes, 39.36 seconds for the 5,000. He set
that last month in Helsinki, Finland, less than two weeks after
breaking the 10,000 mark in Hengelo, Netherlands.
	   The Ethiopian, a winner at Athens and the Atlanta Games over
10,000, will have to contend with Salah Hissou.
	   Other participants include Sergei Bubka, owner of an unrivaled
six pole vault world titles, Olympic steeplechase champion Joseph
Keter and world 400-meter hurdles titlist Stephane Diagana. The
triple jump pits Olympic champion Jonathan Edwards against world
champion Yoelvis Quesada.
	   The women's long jump features all three medalists at Athens _
Lyudmila Galkina, Niki Xanthou and Fiona May _ while the 1,500 has
a showdown between world champion Carla Sacramento, Olympic
champion Svetlana Masterkova, world 5,000 titlist Gabriela Szabo
and cross country champion Sonia O'Sullivan.

UNHCR preparing to protect operations if Croatia wins World Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The U.N. refugee agency said Tuesday it is
preparing to protect its refugee return operations in Bosnia
against outbreaks of ethnic violence if Croatia's football team
wins the World Cup.
	   ``We have been doing some contingency planning to safeguard some
of our return projects in areas which might be targeted by people
celebrating an eventual victory,'' said UNHCR spokeswoman Judith
Kumin.
	   A UNHCR water tanker and two buses used to return refugees were
destroyed in the southern, Croat-held town of Stolac on July 2 as
Bosnian Croat celebrations of Croatia's 3-0 World Cup victory
against Germany turned violent, Kumin said.
	   Some 200 Bosnian Croats marched through a street where Bosnian
Muslims are rebuilding homes, throwing stones and breaking windows,
Kumin said.
	   Local police were present during the incident but did not
intervene in time to prevent the damage, Kumin said.
	   The Stolac area, located 115 kilometers (72 miles) southwest of
the Bosnian capital Sarajevo, is one of the worst hot-spots of
continued ethnic violence against refugees in Bosnia.
	   So far, only around 400 of some 8,000 refugees who fled the town
during the war between Bosnian Croats and Muslims have been able to
return, Kumin said.
	   Ethnic violence has been orchestrated by Croat hard-liners since
the end of the war in 1995, to prevent Muslim refugees from
reclaiming homes they were forced to leave in 1993.
	   In other parts of the country, Bosnian Serb or Muslim
hard-liners have used similar methods to prevent refugees from
returning.
	   Violence following Croatia's victory also flared in other parts
of Bosnia. In the divided city of Mostar, a 25-year-old Muslim
woman was killed and a man was seriously wounded on the Muslim side
when they were hit by bullets fired in celebration from the Croat
side, Bosnian radio reported.

Sweeping reforms adopted, as power passes from king to elected
</HEADLINE>
assembly &QL; 
 &UR; By ARTHUR MAX &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The king of Bhutan has given the
legislature the power to fire him and yielded to parliament the
right to choose his Cabinet, sharply curtailing the powers of the
91-year-old monarchy.
	   The sweeping reforms adopted last week were proposed a month ago
by the king himself in a royal edict. Confirmation of the National
Assembly's endorsement by consensus was received Tuesday in New
Delhi, capital of neighboring India, from isolated Bhutan.
	   It was the biggest step so far in a gradual process of diluting
the absolute power of the monarchy. Bhutanese say they want
democracy without confrontational politics.
	   King Jigme Singye Wangchuck requested that the National Assembly
periodically pass a vote of confidence in his rule, and said a
two-thirds vote against him would require him to abdicate in favor
of the crown prince.
	   The 42-year-old king, whose title Druk Gyalpo means Precious
Ruler of the Dragon People, is the fourth in a dynasty that has
ruled the landlocked, mountainous country since 1907.
	   He retained the right to assign portfolios to the Cabinet
ministers elected by the legislature and said he must be kept
informed of matters of ``security and sovereignty.''
	   The reforms affected only the selection of the Cabinet, a
majority of whom previously were appointed by the king, and they
did not change the indirect election of the National Assembly.
Two-thirds of the 150 parliament members are chosen by district
councils, and the remaining third are appointed by either the king
or the Buddhist clergy.
	   In the first act under the new reforms, the National Assembly
elected six ministers last week.
	   The king's reform edict, published in the national weekly
newspaper Kuensel, expressed concern over ethnic divisions could
affect voting.
	   Nearly 100,000 people of Nepalese origin were evicted or
encouraged to emigrate in the early 1990s when the dominant Drukpas
cracked down on what they called illegal migrants. Nepal, which is
housing most of them in U.N.-administered refugee camps, is
negotiating their return.

Germany sees jump in number of Kosovo Albanian refugees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The number of ethnic Albanians from
Yugoslavia seeking asylum in Germany jumped last month, apparently
due to the growing violence in their home province of Kosovo,
Interior Minister Manfred Kanther said Tuesday.
	   Germany registered 2,804 refugees from Yugoslavia in June, 85
percent of whom said they came from Kosovo. That compares to 2,071
refugees in May and 1,606 in April.
	   Yugoslav refugees comprised by far the biggest single group,
Kanther said.
	   ``The figures show how crucial immediate steps toward peace in
Kosovo are to stop the stream of refugees,'' he said.
	   In all, 7,864 people applied for asylum in Germany last month,
almost 16 percent more than in May, but 5.5 percent fewer than in
June 1997.
	   In the first half of 1998, the total was 42,569 _ the lowest
level since Germany tightened its liberal asylum laws in 1993,
following a wave of post-unification, anti-foreigner violence.
	   With a federal election set for Sept. 27, right-wing parties
have called for even tighter asylum laws.

Taiwan seeks to prevent accidental conflicts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan is studying the feasibility of
establishing procedures between Taipei and Beijing to prevent
accidental conflicts, a military spokesman said Tuesday.
	   The Defense Ministry has commissioned a study of Cold War-era
emergency communication systems and hot lines between allies of the
former Soviet Union and the United States, said Defense Ministry
spokesman Kung Fan-ding.
	   ``Such a system could defuse misunderstandings before they
developed into unintended conflicts,'' Kung said.
	   Greater transparency within the militaries on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait could reduce tensions, said Kung. He said the Defense
Ministry will continue releasing information through its news
conferences and web site ``as far as national security permits.''
The ministry also publishes a defense white paper every two years.
	   China considers Taiwan a breakaway province to be reunited with
the mainland by force if necessary. The sides are engaged in a
low-temperature arms race, and Taiwan warns that a strong shift in
the balance toward its much larger neighbor could destabilize the
region.
	   Tensions rose to their highest level in decades in 1996, when
China lobbed missiles into waters just outside Taiwan's main ports
in a bid to intimidate independence supporters.
	   The United States moved two aircraft carrier groups into
position near Taiwan in a warning to China not to take more
provocative action. Washington is committed by law to sell Taiwan
defensive weapons and consider any threat to the island ``of great
concern.''

World Cup too long, says FIFA chief Blatter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ The length of soccer's World Cup needs
to be cut, new FIFA President Sepp Blatter said in an interview
published Tuesday.
	   ``In the opening phase, teams had six days between matches,''
Blatter was quoted as saying in the Bern daily Der Bund. ``That's
too many. It shouldn't be longer than four days.''
	   He conceded there was a danger of viewers being saturated with
soccer if matches were played closer together, but that the danger
``also exists if the World Cup lasts for 33 days.''
	   ``There's no question that changes must be made in the sale of
tickets,'' Blatter continued, but he did not specify what changes
might be considered. Ticket scandals have dogged the World Cup
finals in France.
	   The new FIFA chief denied he has promised the 2006 World Cup
finals to Africa, but said a rotation system among America, Europe,
Asia and Africa is ``logical.''
	   Africa ``needs to be able to offer the necessary structures'' if
it is to be awarded the tournament, Blatter said.
	   He promised unity on the world soccer body's ruling Executive
Committee and said UEFA President Lennart Johansson, whom Blatter
defeated last month for the FIFA presidency after a bitterly fought
contest, would become one of his ``closest contacts.''
	   ``We're going into the future together now,'' Blatter said.

Top officials cleared of being Securitate collaborators
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ An official investigation has found
that President Emil Constantinescu and other top officials never
served as informants for the Communist-era secret police, Romanian
national radio reported Tuesday.
	   The investigation, ordered by Constantinescu last week, followed
recent exposes of religious and political figures, some of whom
admitted having been informers for the dreaded Securitate. The
health minister resigned, and other lawmakers also quit their
posts.
	   Constantinescu asked intelligence officials to check the
archives and report whether members of National Supreme Defense
Council had worked for the Securitate, which was disbanded after
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was executed in the 1989 anti-Communist
revolution.
	   The council includes the president, chiefs of the domestic and
foreign intelligence services, the prime minister, head of the
armed forces and leaders of key ministries.
	   ``We had to make sure that no top official of this country could
be blackmailed,'' Constantinescu said late Monday.
	   Prime Minister Radu Vasile also said none of his ministers had
worked for the Securitate. Finance Minister Daniel Daianu, who had
been a foreign intelligence agent, resigned from the spy service
``many years ago'' and would not be asked to leave his job, Vasile
said.
	   One in four Romanian adults was said to have worked for the
Securitate during more than 40 years of Communist rule.
	   Last month, Laszlo Toekes, an ethnic Hungarian Protestant bishop
whose opposition to Ceausescu sparked the 1989 revolt, admitted
that he too had collaborated with the secret police after years of
harassment.
	   An estimated 125 million pages of Securitate files are kept
under lock and key. Nevertheless, leaks about alleged links to the
security service have led to many blackmail cases.
	   ``Trust in the state institutions must be restored,''
Constantinescu said. He said the investigation was part of a
``moral reform'' of Romanian society.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two commuter trains collided at a railway station
outside Moscow on Tuesday morning, killing at least three people
and injuring several more, officials said.
	   The accident occurred at the Bekasovo railway station 80
kilometers (50 miles) southwest of Moscow when a service car that
had ignored a red light slammed into the back of a commuter train
bound for Moscow.
	   The train's three cars derailed, and a second commuter train
coming in the opposite direction crashed into the derailed cars and
the service car.
	   The driver of the service car and two drivers of the incoming
train died in the crash and six passengers were wounded, railway
officials said in a statement.

Kuchma tops list of Ukraine's presidential candidates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ President Leonid Kuchma remains on top of
the list of presidential candidates in Ukraine, closely followed by
his Communist rival, according to a poll published Tuesday.
	   Nine percent of those polled said they would vote for Kuchma if
new presidential elections were held now, and 8 percent chose
Communist Party head Petro Simonenko.
	   A surprising third was lawmaker Natalia Vitrenko, a populist who
heads the radical leftist Progressive Socialist Party with 7
percent, followed by her former ally, Socialist ex-parliament
speaker Olexander Morroz with 6 percent.
	   The poll was conducted by the SOCIS-Gallup independent polling
service.
	   However, the poll, conducted in recent days and published by the
daily Dyen, indicated that as many as 49 percent of Ukrainians were
undecided about whom to support in the next presidential elections,
scheduled for October 1999.
	   The poll's statistical margin of error was not given.

	   Todorel Tsiornovalits was arrested Friday in Bulgaria and is
being held by Interpol authorities, according to a spokesman for
the Greek Ministry of Public Order.
	   Tsiornovalits and two accomplices are alleged to have beaten to
death a shopkeeper, Christos Paparitos, in the Greek village of
Velestino in 1996. One of the other suspects was arrested and the
other is still at large.
	   No date for the extradition has been set, said the spokesman.

Expelled South Korean diplomat arrives home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A South Korean diplomat expelled from
Russia on spy charges returned home Tuesday, saying he felt no
regret.
	   ``I did what I had to do as a diplomat. I don't feel ashamed,''
Cho Sung-woo told reporters at Kimpo airport outside Seoul before
he was whisked away by government officials.
	   Foreign Ministry officials began questioning Cho. They planned
to protest the way Russia handled the case, especially the brief
detention of the South Korean diplomat by Russia's Federal Security
officials.
	   Cho, a political officer at the South Korean Embassy in Moscow,
was detained as he met with an alleged contact last Friday. Moscow
ordered him expelled within three days for ``unlawful activities
incompatible with his diplomatic status.''
	   The Federal Security Service, a successor of the Soviet-era KGB,
identified Cho's Russian contact as Valentin Moiseyev, deputy head
of the Foreign Ministry's Asia Affairs Bureau.
	   It planned to charge Moiseyev with providing confidential data
to South Korean security services.
	   It was the first time that a South Korean diplomat had been
expelled by Russia since the two countries opened diplomatic ties
in 1990.

Ukrainian officials report continuing fall in budget revenues
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Budget revenues are continuing to fall in
Ukraine, with the state presently owed more than 6 billion hryvna
(dlrs 3 billion) in taxes and other payments, a government official
said Tuesday.
	   Deputy Finance Minister Volodymyr Matviychuk told parliament
that June revenues amounted to 785 million hryvna (dlrs 392.5
million) instead of the planned 960 million hryvna (dlrs 480
million).
	   In addition to the budget debts, which grew by 2.6 times since
the beginning of 1998, enterprises and companies owed about 1
billion hryvna (dlrs 500 million) to the State Pension Fund.
	   That debt grew by 43.2 million hryvna (dlrs 21.6 million) in
June alone, Matviychuk said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Other pressures on the cash-strapped budget included 1.2 billion
hryvna (dlrs 600 million) in foreign and domestic debt payments
that the government had to cover in June, and emergency payments to
defuse protests by striking coal miners, the official noted.
	   Ukraine, whose economic woes parallel those of Russia, hopes to
secure about dlrs 875 million in new foreign loans to cover the
mounting budget debt, but so far has not been able to attract new
credits from abroad, Matviychuk said.
	   Ukraine is negotiating a dlrs 2.5 billion International Monetary
Fund loan, and the government has moved to slash the planned budget
deficit to about 2.3 percent of gross domestic product and bring
down spending, thus fulfilling IMF demands and reflect the shortage
of revenues.
	   The IMF has been reluctant to approve the loan, citing Ukraine's
stalled economic reforms and the need for structural changes.
	   The budget cuts, however, remain to be approved by the largely
leftist parliament after Cabinet presents it with the new draft.
Cabinet officials voiced skepticism this week about the measure's
chances to pass.
	   One major problem facing Ukraine's government is over 4 billion
hryvna (dlrs 2 billion) in redemption payments for domestic bonds
it has to release by the end of 1998. Foreign investors are wary of
Ukraine's financial markets and are believed to use the money to
buy foreign currency rather than re-invest in bonds.
	   That has increased pressure on the hryvna, which began falling
slightly in recent days against the U.S. dollar. To combat the
trend, the National Bank announced Monday that it was raising key
interest rates from 51 percent to 82 percent.

Asian stock markets close mixed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed mixed Tuesday, with
share prices rising in Tokyo on hopes that the Japanese government
would announce permanent tax cuts after the country's parliamentary
elections on Sunday.
	   Tokyo's 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 65.83 points, or
0.40 percent, closing at 16,416.28. On Monday, the Nikkei index had
fallen 160.79 points, or 0.97 percent, ending eight straight
sessions of gains.
	   Critics at home and abroad have called on Japan to cut taxes as
a way of spurring growth in an economy that shrank in the first
quarter of the year.
	   But it wasn't clear if the Japanese government was ready to take
their advice.
	   On Tuesday, the head of Japan's Economic Planning Agency, Koji
Omi, told a small group of reporters that a permanent tax cut is
likely.
	   But, also on Tuesday, Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi said an
earlier remark that Japan had made a ``promise'' of permanent tax
cuts was a mistake.
	   In currency trading, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 139.83 yen in
late afternoon, down 0.70 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also
below its late New York rate of 140.15 yen overnight.
	   Indonesian shares closed sharply higher. A flurry of buying in
state-controlled cement maker Semen Gresik sent the key index
surging 2.8 percent.
	   Traders said investors grabbed up shares of Semen Gresik in
hopes of cashing in on future gains.
	   The Jakarta Stock Exchange's Composite Index rose 13.4 points to
483.954.
	   Shares in South Korea also surged on expectations that local
interest rates will continue to fall steadily.
	   The yen's stability against the dollar over the past few days
has also encouraged investors in Korea, traders said. With a
stronger yen, South Korean exporters would gain an edge in prices
over their Japanese rivals.
	   The Seoul Stock Exchange's Korea Composite Stock Price Index
rose 7.89 points, or 2.5 percent, to 317.50.
	   Singapore shares closed mostly lower following remarks by Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong that suggested the island's economy could
slip into a recession next year, dealers said.
	   The Straits Times Industrial Index closed 1.1 percent, or 12.33
points, lower at 1,115.18.
	   Goh said shortly before the close of the morning trading session
that ``the possibility of recession is fairly high'' in 1999.
	   Elsewhere:
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed lower in limp
trading, weighed down by bearish sentiment afflicting the region,
dealers said. The benchmark Composite Index fell 6.23 points, or
1.3 percent, to 467.55.
	   BANGKOK: Thai shares closed mixed, despite a moderate rise in
the main index fueled by buying in the energy and building sectors.
The Stock Exchange of Thailand index gained 2.28 points, or 1.0
percent, to 272.28.
	   HONG KONG: Share prices closed generally mixed in extremely thin
trading. The Hang Seng Index fell 39.94 points, or 0.4 percent, to
8,444.18.
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower on profit-taking. The market's
key Weighted Stock Price Index fell 48.88 points, or 0.61 percent,
to 7,845.97.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower, dragged down
by a mixture of profit-taking and consolidation following recent
gains. The NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 21.32 points, or 1.0 percent,
to 2,067.53.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares closed mixed. The Philippine Stock
Exchange Index of 30 selected issues rose 5.93 points, or 0.3
percent, to 1,860.32.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed higher, with industrials
pushing the key index up despite a lackluster performance by
resources. The All Ordinaries Index rose 17.5 percent, or 0.6
percent, to 2,769.3.

	   BUSHBUCKRIDGE, South Africa (AP) _ Rescuers resumed searching on
Tuesday for victims of a bridge collapse, though no more survivors
were expected to be found from the accident that killed at least 13
people.
	   The bridge, which was under construction, collapsed Monday when
a support pillar gave way.
	   Twelve workers were missing and feared dead, according to a
radio report from the South African Broadcasting Corp. Police Capt.
Izak van Zyl said rescue dogs have not detected any signs of life
in the rubble.
	   The confirmed death toll was earlier given at 15 but later
revised to 13. Sixteen people were injured. The victims were
engineers or construction workers.
	   Police and forensic experts and investigators from the Labor
Department were investigating the accident. The 32-meter- (yard-)
long bridge was being built over the Marite River near
Bushbuckridge, 400 kilometers (250 miles) northeast of
Johannesburg.

	   Here is a summary of late news from The Associated Press.
Stories carried ``i'' or ``f'' category codes. Some of the items
below have moved on this circuit in expanded form:
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Protestants determined to
overturn a ban on an Orange Order march threatened police overnight
in Belfast with bullets, rocks, gasoline bombs and grenades in the
most serious street violence since April's peace agreement. The
second night of mob violence late Monday and early Tuesday followed
repeated appeals from leaders of the Orange Order, Northern
Ireland's conservative Protestant brotherhood, for people to
demonstrate peacefully against Sunday's ban on their annual march
through the main Catholic section of Portadown, 30 miles (50 kms)
southwest of Belfast. Britain's minister responsible for governing
Northern Ireland, Mo Mowlam, appealed for Orangemen ``to recognize
that there are sinister elements who are using their protest to
attack the security forces.'' (NORTHERN IRELAND)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police battling ethnic Albanian
insurgents near one of Kosovo's largest cities gained ground
against the rebels after overnight battles, Serb sources reported
Tuesday. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
fighting in the region near the southwestern city of Pec appeared
to be continuing Tuesday. But with phone lines cut and the main
road into the area sealed off by Serb police, the report could not
be verified. The fighting flared Monday, with the
ethnic-Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center reporting one person
killed and three wounded by heavy shelling of Lodja village, near
Pec. Serb sources said armed Albanians opened fire on Serb
villagers, forcing a Serb counterattack. The pro-government Serb
Media Center reported two policemen killed and six others wounded
in the fighting at Lodja. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ A high-level U.S. diplomatic delegation
headed to Nigeria on Tuesday, hoping to restore relations broken
off years ago because of the West African nation's abysmal human
rights record. The U.S. State Department's third-ranking official,
Thomas Pickering, a former ambassador to Nigeria, led the U.S.
delegation scheduled to meet Tuesday with Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar,
Nigeria's new military leader, in the capital of Abuja. The visit
comes as Nigeria's military continues to debate the proposed
release of the country's best-known political prisoner, Moshood
Abiola. The state-controlled Times newspaper said Tuesday that
Abiola's immediate release has been delayed while the ruling
military considers his political future. Abiola, the apparent
winner of 1993's annulled presidential elections, was jailed the
following year and accused of treason. (NIGERIA-US)
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Palestinians are seeking to upgrade their
U.N. status _ and in the process, their international standing _
through a vote in the General Assembly which is opposed by the
United States and Israel. Arab states sponsored a resolution that
would upgrade the Palestinian observer mission to a new status of a
non-voting member in the 185-member assembly. A vote was scheduled
for Tuesday. The United States and Israel have requested to address
the assembly before the tally is taken; Russia and Austria, on
behalf of the European Union, were to make statements after the
vote. Resolutions favoring the Palestinians are routinely approved
with huge margins in the General Assembly, where no member has a
veto, and Tuesday's resolution was expected to pass.
(UN-PALESTINIANS)
	   CHIHUAHUA, Mexico (AP) _ Seemingly reeling in recent elections,
Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party is showing that
it will not be shoved easily out of power. Sunday's remarkably
clean Chihuahua state election gave the PRI something it had never
before seen, and rarely had needed in its 69 years: a return to a
governor's seat it had lost. ``We transformed the PRI, and the
people responded,'' said Patricio Martinez, newly elected governor
of Mexico's largest state. With 89 percent of voting places
reporting late Monday, Martinez had 49.3 percent of the vote to
41.3 percent for Ramon Galindo of the conservative National Action
Party. National Action had captured six state governorships over
the past decade and hopes to challenge for the presidency in the
year 2000. (MEXICO-ELECTIONS)
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Fearing their biggest strike in
decades, shopkeepers barred windows with steel shutters, riot
police guarded ports and power plants and islanders stocked up on
ice, water and flashlight batteries. ``You'd think we were
preparing for a hurricane,'' one shopper said, her arms crammed
with candles and water bottles in a supermarket that ran out of
carts and baskets. Union leaders expect up to half a million of
Puerto Rico's 3.8 million people to join a 48-hour general strike
starting Tuesday to protest the sale of the state telephone
company. Most are government employees, including utility and
health workers. The strike was called to support 6,400 telephone
workers who stopped working June 18 and are accused of slashing
telephone lines that left more than 250,000 islanders without
long-distance service Monday. (PUERTO RICO-STRIKE)

Newspaper: Ugandan soldiers kill more than 50 rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Government troops have killed more than
50 rebels and destroyed 15 of their camps in southwestern Uganda
and in eastern Congo, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   The army troops also rescued an unspecified number of people who
had been abducted by rebels.
	   The operations against the Allied Democratic Forces were part of
a month-long offensive coordinated by the acting army chief of
staff Brig. James Kazini, the government-owned New Vision reported.
	   New Vision did not say when the offensive began, but Kazini took
command in southwestern Uganda after an estimated 80 students
perished in a June 8 fire at a technical school when ADF rebels
torched their dormitory in Kamarole (Fort Portal), 315 kilometers
(195 miles) west of Kampala.
	   The rebels were seeking recruits at Kicwamba Technical College
and set fire to the dormitory when students refused to join them.
	   An additional 100 students are missing and were presumed
abducted by the rebels.
	   Several dozen soldiers and their officers fled when the rebels
attacked.
	   The ADF operates from bases in the thickly forested Rwenzori
mountains on the Uganda-Congo border. It include remnants of former
Ugandan armies, some Muslim fighters and former soldiers from
Rwanda and what used to be know as Zaire. The ADF seeks the ouster
of President Yoweri Museveni, himself a former rebel leader who
took power in 1986 after a five-year bush war.
	   On June 30, Ugandan soldiers and ADF rebels exchanged mortar
fire in neighboring Congo after the rebels attempted to retake a
base.
	   The government is fighting two other rebel movements in
northwestern and northern Uganda.

New Philippine defense chief backs treaty allowing U.S. troop
</HEADLINE>
visits &QL; 
 &UR; By CLARO CORTES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Newly appointed Defense Secretary
Orlando Mercado, who as a senator in 1991 voted against U.S. bases,
said Tuesday he supports a new agreement that would allow American
troops to visit but not be stationed in the Philippines.
	   The lack of an agreement covering the legal status of visiting
U.S. troops has prevented joint U.S. military exercises in the
country since 1996.
	   ``As a small armed force, we need these exercises,'' Mercado
said. ``We need to be able to upgrade our capability and our
readiness.''
	   An agreement on visiting forces was concluded earlier this year
but must be ratified by the Philippine Senate because of a
constitutional requirement that all foreign military deployments in
the country be covered by a Senate-approved treaty. In the United
States, only a presidential executive order is needed.
	   The new Senate, elected in May, has not yet set a date for
debate on the agreement.
	   Mercado said he will lobby for its ratification despite his vote
to reject a lease on U.S. bases in 1991 that forced the last U.S.
military base to close.
	   ``It was not a change of heart,'' Mercado said. ``You have to
take into consideration the milieu in which these two things
happened. ... There will be no stationing of American or foreign
forces in this country.''
	   Mercado, like newly elected President Joseph Estrada, was among
12 Philippine senators who voted seven years ago not to extend the
lease on U.S. bases in the country. The Philippines then was host
to the largest American naval and air forces facilities outside the
United States.
	   The United States halted all joint exercises on Philippine
territory and visits by U.S. military ships in December 1996, when
the Manila government ended a legal loophole that had shielded U.S.
military personnel from prosecution by the Philippines for crimes
committed here.
	   Other countries, including Britain and Singapore, also suspended
military exercises with the Philippines because of a similar
absence of agreements on legal protection for their soldiers.
	   The pacts, generally called status of forces agreements, have
been widely criticized in several Asian countries, including South
Korea and Japan, because of cases in which local police and courts
have had difficulty gaining jurisdiction over American soldiers who
committed serious crimes.
	   Under the agreement, the United States would have jurisdiction
over American troops who commit crimes while on duty in the
Philippines. However, American personnel who violate Philippine
laws while off duty would be subject to prosecution by Philippine
authorities.
	   If it requests, the United States will have custody of American
soldiers being prosecuted in Philippine courts. If the court
proceedings are not completed within a year, the United States will
no longer be obliged to present its soldiers to local courts,
according to the accord.

	   LONDON (AP) _ The London and Frankfurt stock exchanges are
forming a strategic alliance that they hope eventually will lead to
a pan-European stock market, they announced Tuesday. The two
exchanges said they had signed a memorandum of understanding that
will ``harmonize the markets for their leading securities and,
ultimately, to develop a joint electronic trading platform.''
Werner G. Seifert, chief executive of the Deutsche Borse, and Gavin
Casey, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, said they
planned ``a low-cost, efficient and accessible equity market
infrastructure to enable issuers, investors and market participants
to take full advantage of the opportunities arising from the
development of a pan-European capital market.'' The stock market
chiefs said they were trying to make the rules and technology of
their markets more similar while creating ``the nucleus of a single
European stock market'' that is expected eventually to involve
other exchanges. (BRITAIN-GERMANY STOCK EXCHANGE)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian financial markets suffered another heavy
hit on Tuesday, forcing the Central Bank to intervene to prop up
the Russian currency. The Russian stock market was down more than 7
percent by midday and interest rates on shot-term government bonds
shot up to 120 percent, from an 90 percent on Monday. Also, the
ruble began to fall, and the Central Bank stepped in quickly in an
effort to prop up the currency. Russian markets have been wracked

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund,
overseeing a dlrs 17.2 billion rescue fund for the Thai economy, is
expected to ease the loan conditions to help stimulate growth, Thai
Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda said Tuesday. Tarrin told
Dow Jones Newswires that a planned 25 billion baht (dlrs 604
million) deficit in the 825 billion baht (dlrs 19.9 billion)
government budget for the year to Sept. 30, 1999, could be expanded
to provide additional stimulus to a contracting economy. The IMF is
aware that the economic downturn's severity calls for a more
expansionary deficit than the currently mandated 0.5 percent of
gross domestic product, Tarrin said in a telephone interview. ``In
principle, we have agreed already,'' he said. An IMF team is to
arrive in Bangkok in the first week of August for talks on
guidelines for the rescue package during its fifth quarter of
implementation. (THAILAND-IMF BAILOUT)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia will revise its growth
target but try to halt a slide into recession, Finance Minister
Anwar Ibrahim said Tuesday. ``We are hoping not to go to the
negative. We are looking at the figures and want to know how fast
can the (country's latest) stimulus package be implemented,'' Anwar
told reporters. In the last two weeks, the government has announced
two packages totaling 12 billion ringgit (dlrs 3 billion) to revive
the economy by injecting funds. Anwar, who is also the deputy prime
minister, said more such steps would be taken. ``The government
will try to stimulate the economy by establishing new funds.'' The
extra spending will go toward rural development and public
infrastructure projects. The money would come from bond issues,
both local and domestic, as well as other sources, he said.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ As the Asian crisis continues to hurt its
vulnerable economy, Singapore's prime minister said Tuesday his
country will probably slide into recession next year. Although a
contraction this year was not expected, Goh Chok Tong told
reporters that ``for next year, the possibility of a recession is
fairly high.'' Speaking after launching a history exhibition, the
Singapore leader said his country should be able to avoid overall
negative growth this year ``unless things go terribly wrong in the
last quarter.'' Last week, Singapore unveiled wide-ranging economic
measures to cushion the economy as growth continues to dwindle, and
revised its economic forecasts downward for the year. The
off-budget package, worth 2 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 1.17
billion), was to help business cope with the economic downturn, and
will produce Singapore's first budget deficit in over a decade.

Malaysia and Singapore quibble over water contract
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES throughout with prime minister's remarks on
water supply &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
said Tuesday Malaysia would not turn off water supplies to
Singapore, but many problems had to be resolved before long-term
treaties that guarantee the flow could be renewed.
	   ``We have assured them (Singapore officials) that we will give
them the water but there must be conditions to supplying water,''
Mahathir told reporters.
	   He did not specify the areas of disagreement.
	   About half of the 1.2 million cubic meters (42 million cubic
feet) of water consumed daily by Singaporeans comes from Malaysia,
under two treaties. One of them expires in 2011 and the other in
2061.
	   Although the two countries' prime ministers tentatively agreed
in February to renew the water contract, the 60-day deadline for
confirming the terms had meanwhile expired.
	   ``What Singapore seeks is a formal, legally binding water
agreement, which sets out clearly the terms and conditions of the
supply of water after the present water agreements run out in 2011
and 2061,'' Singapore's foreign minister, S. Jayakumar, said last
week.
	   Singapore, a tiny island of 240 square miles (625 square
kilometers), has limited water resources.
	   Water is the most sensitive of the many issues that bedevil
relations between the two Southeast Asian neighbors, which were
once one nation. Squabbles have included territorial conflicts,
diplomatic disputes and even unpaid traffic fines.
	   The latest is over remarks by Malaysian Tourism Minister
Sabbaruddin Chik, who last week alleged that a conference organizer
in Singapore deliberately excluded Malaysia from a brochure of
countries to be visited by delegates to an upcoming convention.
	   On Saturday, Singapore Minister without Portfolio Lim Boon Heng
said Sabbaruddin should apologize for ``totally unwarranted''
comments.
	   However, Sabbaruddin refused, a local newspaper reported
Tuesday.
	   ``Why should I apologize?'' Sabbaruddin was quoted as saying in
Tuesday's Star newspaper. ``The organizers should apologize to
Malaysia for excluding us from their brochure.''
	   Singapore has said the government had no role in compiling the
brochure, but Sabbaruddin said he does not believe it was a simple
oversight by convention organizers.
	   The Rotary Convention, due to meet in Malaysia next year, had
offered travel for its members attending the conference to several
destinations around the region before and after the event.

U.N., governments pledge fight against skin-eating bacteria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The United Nations and more than 20 countries
worldwide have committed themselves to stepping up the fight to
control Buruli ulcer, a disfiguring disease becoming more
widespread in West Africa, the U.N. health agency said Tuesday.
	   In a declaration signed during a three-day meeting in the
Yamoussoukro, Ivory Coast, government representatives promised to
provide education, resources and surgical facilities to fight the
disease, the World Health Organization said in a statement.
	   Some 10,000 cases of the potentially fatal skin-eating bacteria
have been recorded in the Ivory Coast since 1978, according to WHO.
	   In parts of neighboring Ghana, 22 percent of villagers are
affected, while 2,300 cases have been recorded in Benin over the
last nine years.
	   Surgery, unaffordable for most patients, is currently the only
treatment for the disease, first detected in Australia in 1948.
	   Buruli ulcer destroys skin and underlying tissues and causes
deforming lesions, and can lead to loss of eyes, breasts and other
organs if left untreated.
	   ``It surely will have severe social and economic consequences
for affected countries in West Africa if it is not addressed with
the urgency it deserves,'' said Ebrahim Samba, WHO regional
director for Africa.
	   He warned that the disease is spreading rapidly in West Africa.
Cases also have been reported in Asia and Latin America.
	   Efforts to combat the disease have been hampered by the fact
that little is known about how it is transmitted to humans.
	   Patients, who come to health centers at late stages of the
disease, mostly live in rural areas near rivers or wetlands, WHO
said.

ASEAN foreign ministers to delay decision on Cambodian membership
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Association of Southeast Asian
Nations will wait until later this year to decide whether to accept
Cambodia as a member, an official said Tuesday.
	   Philippine Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Lauro Baja Jr. said
a decision to admit Cambodia could be made before ASEAN leaders
meet in Vietnam in December if the outcome is positive in July 26
elections aimed at demonstrating Cambodia's political normalcy.
	   Much of the ASEAN decision will depend on a statement to be
released by a group of international observers, including
representatives of ASEAN countries, who will be monitoring the
elections, Baja said.
	   ASEAN foreign ministers are to meet in Manila July 24-29.
Cambodia was scheduled to join the regional organization at a
foreign ministers' meeting a year ago, but the ministers decided to
delay its membership after co-premier Hun Sen seized power in a
coup in early July 1997, shattering a tense dual premiership formed
after U.N.-led elections in 1993.
	   ASEAN has said that free and fair elections will be a sign that
political normalcy has returned to the country.
	   ``Much will depend on the outcome'' of the elections, Baja told
reporters.
	   ASEAN's decision to defer Cambodia's membership has been seen by
some people as interference in the country's internal affairs,
which is currently prohibited by the organization's policies.
	   Baja said he expects the foreign ministers will discuss whether
that policy should be changed.
	   Events this past year such as the Asian currency crisis and the
haze from Indonesian fires that blanketed much of the region have
illustrated how internal policies of individual countries can
affect the entire region.
	   Baja said the foreign ministers plan to discuss the financial
crisis, but the question of Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor,
a former Portuguese colony, is not on the official agenda.
	   ASEAN consists of Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar,
the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Mir to be abandoned around mid-1999, space official says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The last crew on the Mir will probably head up to
the space station next February and remain until the middle of
1999, Russian space officials said Tuesday.
	   Space officials had wanted to keep a crew on the Mir until the
end of 1999. But in recent days, several senior officials have said
the Mir is likely to be abandoned around June of next year due
largely to money shortages.
	   The final crew is expected to include one French and one Slovak
astronaut along with a Russian cosmonaut, Boris Ostroumov, a deputy
director of the Russian Space Agency, was quoted as saying by
Interfax.
	   After a series of near disasters last year, the 12-year-old Mir
has been running relatively smoothly this year. However, the main
problem now is a lack of cash.
	   The money problem was so severe that officials were talking
about abandoning the Mir after the current crew returns in August.
	   But last week, the government promised to pay the dlrs 600
million it owed for Mir's operations last year and agreed to extend
the station's lifetime until June 1999.
	   Ostroumov said on Tuesday that the next crew will blast off for
Mir in August as scheduled.
	   Next February, that crew will be replaced by one last team that
will help bring the station down, Ostroumov said, according to
Interfax.
	   To control Mir's descent to Earth, space agency plans to launch
several cargo ships to dock with the station and use their engines
to guide it into lower orbits. Most of the Mir is expected to burn
up during re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, while large pieces
will be directed to fall into the sea.

Thousands of pensioners rally to demand bigger pensions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Thousands of pensioners rallied Tuesday
to demand bigger pensions that a high court says they should have
but the government refuses to grant.
	   ``Pensioners financed the state budget for years - without
interest rates,'' Ivan Nahtigal, head of one of the pensioners'
associations, told the crowd of about 5,000. ``Now we just want
what's ours.''
	   Constitutional Court, whose decisions are mandatory, ruled last
month that the pensioners were discriminated against by the
government's 1993 decision to freeze their pensions and not
automatically tie them to inflation.
	   The government maintains that it does not have the money to
significantly raise pensions, now at a monthly average of dlrs 300.
	   The pensioners cite independent legal experts, who say that
Croatia's retirees have lost 30 billion kuna (dlrs 5 billion)
between 1993 and the present, and that their pensions now should be
up to 100 percent higher,
	   The government says that back-paying the pensioners to make up
for the shortfall between 1993 and now would put a huge dent in the
economy. It has instead offered a one-time increase amounting to 5
percent.
	   The increasing gap between the country's elite _ mostly
President Franjo Tudjman's associates and businessmen close to his
government _ and the rest of the population has led to growing
popular dissatisfaction.
	   Failing to respond to the pensioners' demands could hurt
Tudjman's party in elections late next year _ pensioners, normally
faithful Tudjman supporters, make up a fifth of the population.

Klaus will not form a minority government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Former Premier Vaclav Klaus said
Tuesday his Civic Democratic Party will not try to form a minority
government.
	   ``The Civic Democratic Party does not believe in such a
solution,'' Klaus told Czech radio after meeting of his party's
leadership Tuesday. ``Such a government would not guarantee a
long-term stability in the country.''
	   The statement came in reaction to an offer Monday by two small
center-right parties, the Freedom Union and the Christian
Democrats, to support a minority Cabinet under Klaus should his
party decide to form one. The two parties, however, ruled out
possible coalition with Klaus.
	   The offer was apparently provoked by Klaus' talks with Social
Democratic leader Milos Zeman, whose party won the largest number
of seats in the June election.
	   But Zeman's party captured only 74 seats in the 200-member
parliament, too few to form a government on its own.
	   Zeman, whose party lacks any center-left allies, said the Social
Democrats might seek support from Klaus if their negotiations with
the small center-right parties fail to produce a government.
	   Klaus, the election runner-up with 63 seats, did not rule out
such a possibility. That scared the two smaller parties, who now
fear they could loose their say in further coalition talks.
	   The two small parties -- the Freedom Union and the Christian
Democrats -- hold 19 and 20 seats.
	   ``The experience ... makes us convinced that by forming such a
(minority) government, the Civic Democratic Party would fall
hostage to the Freedom Union and the Christian Democrats, and the
mandate of such a government would be ... very limited,'' Klaus
told the radio.
	   The Christian Democrats were members of the former Klaus'
three-party coalition, but stepped out late last year forcing the
Cabinet to resign. The Freedom Union was later formed by rebels
against Klaus within his Civic Democratic Party.
	   Should Zeman fail in his efforts to build a stable coalition,
President Vaclav Havel is expected to ask Klaus to attempt the
same.
	   Futher talks of Zeman and Klaus were scheduled for later
Tuesday.

World Cup: No doping detected in first 60 matches
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID MINTHORN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Doping tests were carried out on 240 players at the
first 60 matches of the World Cup and none were found positive for
illegal substances, FIFA's medical committee announced Tuesday.
	   ``There were 240 tests and 240 negative results,'' Dr. Lars
Peterson of Sweden, a medical committee member, announced.
	   He said the tests encompassed a majority of the players who got
into games at the World Cup through the quarterfinals' matches, and
that the negative results were ``a source of great satisfaction.''
	   ``This is not a victory. We still have four matches left,''
Peterson said at a news conference before the semifinals' matches
Tuesday and Wednesday, the third-place game Saturday and the final
on Sunday.
	   The 1994 World Cup in the United States was shaken by a doping
scandal involving Argentine superstar Diego Maradona, whose urine
test detected the stimulant ephedrine. He was kicked off the team
and served a 15-month playing ban imposed by FIFA.
	   Dr. Michel D'Hooghe of Belgium, another member of the medical
committee, attributed the testing results at France 98 to efforts
by the world soccer federation and medical officials of the 32
teams to combat illegal substances, including muscle-building
steroids and various stimulants.
	   ``We emphasized to all team doctors that we should have a World
Cup without doping,'' D'Hooghe said.
	   The medical committee said that of all major sports, soccer has
by far the lowest incidence of illegal drug use. Members attributed
this primarily to the ``collective'' aspect of a team sport that
condemns performance-enhancing substances.
	   At the World Cup, Peterson said, four field players are chosen
by lot from each team at halftime to undergo post-match urine tests
_ two primary and two backups in case of an injury.
	   The samples are brought by courier to an ``absolutely neutral
lab'' in Paris approved by the International Olympic Committee for
testing of banned substances, including muscle-building steroids
and stimulants. Each test costs the equivalent of dlrs 150.
	   The medical officials said hashish and marijuana were among the
stimulants on FIFA's list of illegal substances. Although neither
is believed to be especially performance-enhancing for soccer
players, the World Cup teams agreed with FIFA to put them on the
banned list.

Patten reserves judgment on `one country, two systems' for Taiwan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with President Lee's comments in grafs 3-5; RECASTS
throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Hong Kong's former colonial governor said
Tuesday outsiders should not judge whether the ``one country, two
systems'' autonomy model offered by China is suitable for Taiwan.
	   ``I don't think people from outside can come in and give
lectures on these sorts of issues,'' Chris Patten, who is filming a
British Broadcasting Corp. series about Asia, told reporters.
	   In an interview with Patten, Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui said
that ``one country, two systems'' was ``ambiguous, contradictory,
undemocratic ... and totally unacceptable.''
	   ``It is completely opposed to the peaceful, democratic
unification that we're looking for,'' Lee was quoted as saying in a
statement from the presidential office.
	   ``How do you designate `one country?' How could a sovereign
nation permit two separate systems to operate?'' Lee asked.
	   China originally drafted the ``one country, two systems'' model
as a blueprint for reunification with Taiwan, which it claims as a
breakaway province. The system, under which Hong Kong returned to
Chinese rule in 1997 with considerable autonomy, is highly
unpopular here.
	   Patten handed Hong Kong over to China on July 1, 1997,
concluding a turbulent term as the last British governor, during
which he clashed repeatedly with China over his program to expand
democracy in the territory.
	   China pledged to let Hong Kong keep its freewheeling capitalist
lifestyle and key freedoms for at least 50 years. It has mostly
kept out of the territory's affairs, and Patten said Hong Kong
people retained their freedoms a year after the handover.
	   Taiwan, which elected its first president by full suffrage in
1996, argues it is not a colony like Hong Kong was, and therefore
cannot have its fate dictated by outside forces. Many here question
whether ``one country, two systems'' is workable in Hong Kong, let
alone Taiwan.

NATO membership prospect divides Baltics, Russia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHAEL TARM &QC;

<TEXT>
	   SAATSE, Estonia (AP) _ Every morning, farmer Nikolai Vosunurm
wakes up in Estonia, then walks a couple of steps to his bathroom
in Russia. His small log cabin straddles the border.
	   But despite his daily life in two countries, Vosunurm has only
one opinion in the debate between Russia and the West over NATO
expansion into the Baltic states.
	   Asked which way he would run if NATO and Russian tanks squared
off along the border that bisects his home, Vosunurum pointed west
and said ``That way _ to NATO.''
	   Whether Vosunurm would ever have to make that choice could
become clearer after Wednesday's meeting of U.S. Deputy Secretary
of State Strobe Talbott with the three Baltics' foreign ministers,
where NATO expansion is expected to top the agenda.
	   The meeting is the first session of the Baltic Partnership
Council, created by the charter that Washington and the Baltics
signed in January in which the United States expressed support for
their desire to join NATO.
	   Russia adamantly opposes including former Soviet republics in
the alliance and many observers believe the United States won't
push for the Baltics' membership in order to avoid antagonizing the
Kremlin.
	   The Baltics' only real hope of achieving the NATO membership
they so avidly desire is if Russia drops it opposition, said
Aleksandr Astrov, a leading Estonian commentator on Russian
affairs.
	   ``But I dont ever see Russia doing that,'' he said. ``At least
not in the foreseeable future, and not if Russia is the kind of
country it is today.''
	   Others say they accept NATO's assurances that the Baltics can
join, once their militaries meet alliance criteria.
	   ``I think NATO understands the consequences of locking the
Baltics out,'' said Estonian Foreign Ministry official Toivo Klaar.
``If there is ever the impression that a line is being drawn west
of the Baltics that would send the signal that this part of Europe
is up for grabs. This would be destabilizing.''
	   Russia argues that destabilization is exactly what's at risk if
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania enter the alliance.
	   ``If the Baltic countries are drawn into the alliance ... we
will not remain indifferent. In this way, step by step, we could go
back to Cold War times,'' Col. Gen. Leonid Ivashov of the Russian
Defense Ministry told the news agency Interfax last month.
	   Russia has grudgingly accepted NATO's expansion to Hungary, the
Czech Republic and Poland, which brings the alliance to the Russian
border at the enclave of Kaliningrad. But further expanding to the
Baltics would leave Kalinigrad surrounded by NATO and extend the
alliance's reach to a 400-kilometer (250-mile) section of Russia's
vulnerable western frontier.
	   Each side feels threatened by the other, as reflected in the
comments of people who live within a few kilometers of each other.
	   ``Nobody here wants our border to become a NAT0 border _
nobody,'' Svetlana Zhelenkova, a school director in the Russian
town of Pechory, said by telephone. ``Having NATO just down our
street would create a very stressful, very dangerous situation.''
	   But just down the road, in Saatse, Mari Kasipuu said ``We've
seen so many invasions by Russia, and know it can't be trusted. If
NATO helps keep Russia away, great.''
	   Vosunurm, meanwhile, trying to keep relations good with both
sides. He's thankful Russia didn't bulldoze his cabin when the
border was demarcated after the 1991 Soviet Union collapse and he
invites Russian border patrols in for coffee.
	   And he's both amused and bemused to find his little home percehd
on a potential international fault line.
	   ``That would be something else, wouldn't it? Having both NATO
and Russia come right up to here?,'' he said, rubbing his chin.

Philippine peso edges higher; stocks end mixed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine peso was generally
higher against the U.S. dollar in quiet trading Tuesday, buoyed by
minimal demand for dollars and generally stronger regional
currencies, traders said.
	   The dollar strengthened, however, toward the end of trading and
last changed hands at 41.440 pesos, its high for the day.
	   The U.S. currency averaged 41.370 pesos for the day, down
slightly from Monday's 41.410 pesos.
	   Traders said corporate demand for dollars was minimal, with
banks satisfied with their current holdings of both dollars and
pesos in the absence of external and domestic developments that
could affect trading.
	   However, participants continued to closely monitor regional
developments, particularly those affecting the yen and the Chinese
yuan, traders said.
	   On the stock market, shares ended mixed as some investors,
encouraged by a stable Japanese yen, hunted for bargains, while
others cashed in on gains made early in the session, dealers said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 5.93 points,
or 0.3 percent, to 1,860.32, following Monday's 4.85-point decline.
	   Declines, however, trounced gains 53 to 32, while 51 issues were
unchanged.
	   Shares of food and beverage conglomerate San Miguel Corp. closed
lower as investors sold on news that Eduardo Cojuangco has been
renamed chairman of the company, replacing Andres Soriano III, who
resigned last week.
	   San Miguel A shares fell 2.3 percent while B shares lost 6.2
percent.
	   ``This is now what you call a sell-on-news mentality. Now comes
the hard part, which is Cojuangco proving that he can improve the
company's performance,'' said Ian Kane, trader for Anscor-Hagedorn
Securities Inc.
	   Some investors have been dissatisfied with Soriano's management
and have pinned their hopes on Cojuangco being able to turn the
company around.
	   Cojuangco was chairman of San Miguel during the administration
of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos. After Marcos' ouster in
1986, the government seized Cojuangco's 47 percent interest in the
company, saying it was acquired through improper means. Cojuangco
has denied the charge.

Protestants attack police over Portadown Orangemen's blocked march
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with statements from Trimble, Blair &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Protestants determined to
overturn a ban on an Orange Order march attacked police overnight
in Belfast with bullets, rocks, gasoline bombs and grenades in the
most serious street violence since April's peace agreement.
	   The second night of mob violence late Monday and early Tuesday
followed repeated appeals from leaders of the Orange Order,
Northern Ireland's conservative Protestant brotherhood, for people
to demonstrate peacefully against Sunday's ban on their annual
march through the main Catholic section of Portadown, 30 miles (50
kms) southwest of Belfast.
	   Britain's minister responsible for governing Northern Ireland,
Mo Mowlam, appealed for Orangemen ``to recognize that there are
sinister elements who are using their protest to attack the
security forces.''
	   And David Trimble, a past defender of Portadown's Orangemen who
is the newly elected minister heading Northern Ireland's new
power-sharing government, said ``hooligan elements are continuing
the work that the IRA have been engaged in for the past 30 years.''
	   ``Orangemen must realize that if this violence continues, it
will only be a matter of time before we once again are following
coffins,'' Trimble said.
	   In London, Prime Minister Tony Blair announced he would be
``very pleased to meet'' an Orange delegation at his London office,
probably Wednesday, to hear their demand to be allowed to march
past Catholic homes along Portadown's Garvaghy Road.

Officials hold talks as airport problems continue
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with passenger comment, more comment from airport
officials, air cargo handler moves some operations back to old
airport facilities &QL; 
 &UR; By PRISCILLA CHEUNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Senior officials held urgent talks Tuesday to
try to solve glitches that have marred the opening of Hong Kong's
huge new airport by leaving passengers waiting for bags, stuck on
planes or wondering where flights were.
	   A major air cargo handler moved some operations back to the old
airport because of the problems that were nagging Chek Lap Kok
airport on its second day of operation. Passengers, too, were
frustrated.
	   Computer problems caused some flight delays, but the number of
passengers affected wasn't known.
	   ``The computer went down and lost track of some flight
information,'' said Chris Donnolly, an Airport Authority spokesman.
	   Computer glitches also caused delays in baggage handling and
flight information. Donnolly said passengers had to wait 20-30
minutes for their bags, which he termed ``not desirable, but not
unacceptable.''
	   Some passengers had to wait ``till the early hours'' Tuesday for
their baggage, Donnolly said.
	   By late afternoon, mechanical problems in air bridges and
docking areas still were not fixed, he said.
	   The new airport, built on reclaimed land on a remote outlying
island, was opened Monday to replace venerable Kai Tak, famous for
its roof-skimming approaches over congested urban areas.
	   Airport officials dismissed charges of planning errors and said
minor problems were expected in the early days of operation. About
80,000 passengers and 220 flights used the airport Monday. Another
100,000 residents visited the airport, Donnolly said.
	   Chief Secretary Anson Chan, Hong Kong's top civil servant, and
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang met with Airport Authority
officials to sort out the problems.
	   ``What we want to do is prevent small problems from building up
into big problems,'' Chan said. She added that the problems did not
affect the airport's safety.
	   She said the government was in contact with airline
representatives about the problems.
	   The government's efforts didn't immediately reduce the
frustration that passengers and cargo handlers felt.
	   Anthony Charter, managing director of Hong Kong Air Cargo
Terminals, told Hong Kong radio that the reception of some air
freight exports and release of some imports would be moved back to
the company's old facilities at Kai Tak airport because of computer
problems at the new airport.
	   Wendy Au, a 16-year-old student who arrived Tuesday on a
Canadian Air flight from Vancouver, found the new airport chaotic.
``I'm very frustrated,'' she said.
	   Au said it took her about 90 minutes from the time the plane
landed to get off the plane, clear immigration and customs and
retrieve her luggage. She said she saw no signs for getting out of
the restricted area into the general arrival hall.
	   Her father complained that the flight was not listed on the
arrivals board.
	   Clinton Leeks, the authority's corporate development director,
said there was only so much testing of the system that could be
done before the airport was opened.
	   ``No matter how many trials you do, you can't duplicate the
effect of 70,000 to 80,000 people just coming day after day after
day with a very short respite during a brief overnight period,'' he
said on Radio Hong Kong.
	   Hong Kong newspapers gave the airport opening mixed reviews.
	   The Apple Daily urged understanding, saying, ``Even when we move
house, we encounter many trivial problems that cause inconvenience,
let alone such a massive operation as moving the airport.''
	   However, the Oriental Daily News was less forgiving. It said the
problems showed that the airport wasn't ready for operation.
``People's safety is at stake. The transition between the old and
new airport should have been perfect,'' it said.

World Cup: Croatia aims to extend its astounding run into final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Sports-Soccer-Croatia &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VITTEL, France (AP) _ Croatian star Davor Suker hasn't had his
fill yet, even though his team is in the World Cup semifinals on
its first attempt.
	   ``The most emotional thing is being here for the first time, but
you still have to write the story until the end,'' the striker said
Tuesday. ``What's important is to reach the final.''
	   Croatia is battling host France in Paris on Wednesday for a spot
in the title match.
	   Coach Miroslav Blazevic said he will stick with the lineup that
humiliated Germany 3-0 in the quarterfinal.
	   ``It's logical that the team that achieved such a result will
remain unchanged,'' he said at the team's training headquarters in
this eastern French spa town.
	   Suker said Croatia will be fresher for the semifinal than
France, which needed an overtime ``golden goal'' to down Paraguay
in the second round and penalty kicks to overcome Italy after a
scoreless draw in their quarterfinal.
	   ``This is our advantage,'' Suker said. ``They will feel that
more and more with every minute the game goes on.''
	   The Real Madrid striker insisted that he and his teammates won't
have trouble maintaining their ambition after the triumph over
Germany, where Croatia satisfied its hunger to avenge a stinging
defeat by the Germans at the 1996 European Championship.
	   ``When you play in the World Cup, all the players are
euphoric,'' he said.
	   Blazevic conceded he still gives France the top contender for
the world champion's title.
	   ``No team has such a concentration of talent,'' he said,
rattling off a list of top European clubs for which the French
internationals play.
	   But he noted that Croatia's outsider role has served it well so
far.
	   ``It's precisely when you play against the big favorite that you
are motivated,'' he said.

Mugabe, Kabila and defense chiefs hold talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ President Robert Mugabe and Zimbabwean
security chiefs met with Congolese President Laurent Kabila for
talks believed to have focused on security issues, Zimbabwe's state
media reported Tuesday.
	   Kabila flew home late Monday after three hours of talks in
Harare, the state-controlled Herald newspaper said.
	   The government gave no details of the talks, but The Herald said
security topics were discussed.
	   It said Kabila described shootings around his presidential
palace in Kinshasa on Friday as ``a small incident'' when
questioned by reporters in Harare.
	   ``It even happens in Washington,'' he said.
	   Earlier, the official Zimbabwe news agency reported Zimbabwean
military instructors are training Kabila's troops and said the
state-owned arms maker Zimbabwe Defense Industries is supplying
equipment to his forces.
	   The agency said Zimbabwe defense forces chiefs Gen. Vitalis
Zvinavashe and Gen. Constantine Chiwenga joined Foreign Minister
Stan Mudenge at Mugabe's side during Monday's talks.
	   Mugabe, who last month ended a one-year term as chairman of the
Organization of African Unity, has strongly defended Kabila against
criticism from Western nations and human rights groups.
	   Zimbabwean Industry and Commerce Minister Nathan Shamuyarira
recently urged Zimbabwean businesses to continue supplying Kabila's
Congo despite complaints of non-payment.

Marcos ally returns as chairman of Philippines' San Miguel Corp.

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Business tycoon Eduardo Cojuangco
Jr., a close ally of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, was
reappointed Tuesday as chairman of San Miguel Corp., 12 years after
he was booted out of the Philippines' largest food and beverage
conglomerate.
	   Cojuangco's return to San Miguel paves the way for the political
and economic rehabilitation of one of the most powerful figures
during the Marcos administration.
	   Cojuangco had been forced to leave San Miguel in 1986 after
Marcos was ousted in a ``people power'' revolt, and his shares in
the company were seized by the government.
	   His return comes a week after the inauguration of newly elected
President Joseph Estrada, a former Marcos supporter. Cojuangco, a
strong backer of Estrada's presidential bid, is also chairman of
Estrada's Struggle of the Filipino Masses party.
	   Estrada denied any connection to Cojuangco's return to the
company, best known for its San Miguel brand beer, insisting he
``had nothing to do with that.''
	   But others were skeptical.
	   ``It doesn't take much to put two and two together,'' said Rep.
Leonardo Montemayor, the president of a farmers' group. ``The
natural conclusion ... is that there was a political settling of
debt.''
	   Estrada's appointments since becoming president include Felix de
Guzman, a close associate of Cojuangco lawyer Estelito Mendoza, as
head of the agency in charge of recovering Marcos' alleged
ill-gotten wealth.
	   The agency, the Presidential Commission on Good Government,
seized 47 percent of San Miguel's shares in 1986 because of
allegations they were acquired illegally. It appoints the
government directors in the company.
	   Cojuangco's return to San Miguel is expected to speed the
resolution of an arduous ownership battle over the impounded
shares.
	   The shares consist of Cojuangco's 20 percent stake, estimated to
be worth 23 billion pesos (dlrs 561 million), and a 27 percent
share held by the government-sequestered United Coconut Planters
Bank, which was controlled by Cojuangco under Marcos.
	   A coalition of coconut farmers and workers criticized
Cojuangco's appointment Tuesday, claiming he used coconut levy
funds from millions of poor farmers deposited in the coconut bank
to buy San Miguel shares during the Marcos administration.
	   ``The re-entry of Cojuangco into the San Miguel Corp. as its
chairman will symbolically mark the politicization of business and
the return of crony capitalism in the Philippines just like the
days under the Marcos dictatorship,'' said the National Coalition
of Small Coconut Farmers' and Workers' Organizations.
	   The way for Cojuangco's appointment was opened last week when
San Miguel's former chairman, Andres Soriano III, and five other
board members stepped down to give way to a new management.
	   Of the nine remaining board members, eight voted for Cojuangco
at a special board meeting Tuesday. One board member, a government
representative, was absent.
	   Cojuangco, who was not present at the meeting, is scheduled to
assume the chairmanship Wednesday.

Two dead in traffic accident involving Turkisk prime minister's convoy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ A private car Tuesday slammed into a vehicle
which was part of a motorcade for the visiting Turkish prime minister,
killing two people and injuring five others, Macedonian radio reported.
	   Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz was not injured, the report said. But
Turkish cabinet minister Rustu Kazim Yucelen and three other members of the
Turkish delegation were hurt. Their conditions were not reported.
	   The two dead -- including the woman driver and her companion -- were in a
Czech-made car with Macedonian plates. 
	   State-run Macedonian Radio said the accident occurred near the town of
Bitola, birthplace of the father of modern Turkey, Mustafa Kamel, or Ataturk.
It is located 100 kilometers (60 miles) south of capital Skopje. 
	   The delegation was headed to Bitola after official meetings in the
capital.
	   Yilmaz was travelling in another car with his Macedonian counterpart,
Branko Crvenkovski.
	   The large Turkish delegation, which included a number of Turkish
businessmen seeking business opportunities and closer ties with the former
Yugoslav republic, eventually reached Bitola where they were to open an
honorary consulate.

Israel places great weight on visit of South African official
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel is placing great weight on the visit of
the highest South African government official to visit since Nelson
Mandela took power, foreign ministry officials said Tuesday.
	   Aziz Pahad, South Africa's deputy foreign affairs minister, is
scheduled to begin a two-day visit here on Thursday. Officials said
they will use the visit both to present Israel's position on the
faltering peace talks with the Palestinians and to bolster economic
relations between the two countries.
	   Israel maintained close ties with South Africa's apartheid
government before Mandela's government came to power in the
country's first all-race elections in 1994, and reportedly helped
develop the country's nuclear program in the 1970s and 1980s.
	   Uri Oren, Israel's ambassador to South Africa, said members of
Mandela's government who struggled for years against white-minority
rule have been sympathetic to the Palestinian cause.
	   ``Although their policy is formally an even-handed one, there
has been criticism of the peace process,'' Oren said, ``They
identify with Palestinian struggle for liberation.''
	   Israel-Palestinian negotiations have been stalled since March
1997 and are now deadlocked over the scope of a promised Israeli
troop pullback in the West Bank.
	   Economic relations between Israel and South Africa are strong,
officials said. A total of dlrs 3 billion in trade is generated a
year between the countries, a sizable percentage of which involves
the diamond industry.
	   During his stay, Pahad will visit meet Prime Minister Benjamin

Two dead in traffic accident involving Turkisk prime minister's convoy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ A private car Tuesday slammed into a vehicle
which was part of a motorcade for the visiting Turkish prime minister,
killing two people and injuring five others, Macedonian radio reported.
	   Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz was not injured, the report said. But
Turkish cabinet minister Rustu Kazim Yucelen and three other members of the
Turkish delegation were hurt. Their conditions were not reported.
	   The two dead -- including the woman driver and her companion -- were in a
Czech-made car with Macedonian plates. 
	   State-run Macedonian Radio said the accident occurred near the town of
Bitola, birthplace of the father of modern Turkey, Mustafa Kamel, or Ataturk.
It is located 100 kilometers (60 miles) south of capital Skopje. 
	   The delegation was headed to Bitola after official meetings in the
capital.
	   Yilmaz was travelling in another car with his Macedonian counterpart,
Branko Crvenkovski.
	   The large Turkish delegation, which included a number of Turkish
businessmen seeking business opportunities and closer ties with the former
Yugoslav republic, eventually reached Bitola where they were to open an
honorary consulate.

 &UR; World Cup: France, Croatia seek first World Cup final &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout.
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ France has been trying in vain since
1930 to get to the World Cup final. Debutant Croatia hasn't yet
experienced failure in this tournament. Which of the two ironclad
defenses will yield in Wednesday's semifinal?
	   France is seeking to become the first host nation in 20 years to
reach the final but has lost its scoring touch along the way,
tallying one lone goal in its last four hours of play as it
struggled past Paraguay and Italy.
	   Croatia, which gained independence only seven years ago, has
already surpassed modest expectations and, unburdened by pressure,
sparkled with thrills and goals as it swept past Germany in the
quarterfinals 3-0.
	   In this coming-of-age game against Germany, Davor Suker
personified Croatia's play with deft skills and lethal finishing,
showing that newcomers can have the cool heads of veterans.
	   Suker believes Croatia has the edge because it will be fresher
for the semifinal than France, which needed an overtime ``golden
goal'' to down Paraguay in the second round and penalty kicks to
overcome Italy after a scoreless draw in their quarterfinal.
	   ``This is our advantage,'' Suker said. ``They will feel that
more and more with every minute the game goes on.''
	   French forward Youri Djorkaeff conceded, ``They have the wind in
their sails.''
	   Yet, in spite of the evidence, France is considered the favorite
for the semifinal.
	   For one thing, the French have the crowd behind them. The nation
of 60 million has slowly but surely been waking up to prospect of
winning the cup, and with every game the pulse of France has been
quickening.
	   At the Stade de France on Wednesday, the vast majority of the
80,000 fans will be rooting for Les Bleus and urging them on to
finally, at last, score another goal.
	   Home advantage would seem a formidable help, but one has to go
back to 1978 in Argentina to see a host nation prevail.
	   France was the losing semifinalist in three earlier World Cups _
in 1958, 1982 and 1986.
	   This French team, though, has shown great confidence throughout
the tournament, and with a defense like it has, who wouldn't.
	   Led by Marcel Desailly and Laurent Blanc in the center and
Lilian Thuram and Bixente Lizarazu over the wings, it has conceded
only one goal so far, a penalty at that. The defense is tall and
robust in the center and quick on the wings to counter deep
penetration from opponents.
	   It seems the only person not impressed with the French defense
is Croatian coach Miroslav Blazevic. He calls it ``not that
strong'' and ``vulnerable.''
	   France's defensive midfield is not to be scoffed at, either,
with Didier Deschamps and Emmanuel Petit tirelessly working to feed
playmaker Zinedine Zidane.
	   It is up front that the problems lie. Everything works like
clockwork until the ball has to be put into the net and there,
everything has stalled for the last two games.
	   The Golden Goal winner against Paraguay last week was scored by
defender Blanc.
	   The situation is so bad that forwards like Djorkaeff are driven
to bold predictions.
	   ``I know I will score. I feel I will score against Croatia,'' he
said.
	   For other strikers only the result counts.
	   ``It doesn't matter if I don't score. The most important is the
defense and the title,'' said Stephane Guivarc'h.
	   Croatia also has had a watertight defense in its 1-0
second-round win over Romania and its demolition of Germany, with
Igor Stimac, Slaven Bilic and Dario Simic providing a rock solid
base.
	   The heart of the team is captain and central midfielder Zvonimir
Boban, who may be less elegant than Zidane, but who also spreads
the ball around with great efficiency.
	   Wingers Mario Stanic and Robert Jarni keep play open wide as
much as possible with their deep runs, providing space for Boban
and the forwards.
	   Real Madrid's Suker already has four goals and can still equal
or surpass the top scoring of the tournament _ five goals by
Christian Vieri of Italy and Argentine Gabriel Batistuta _ with two
games to go.
	   ``They have great individuals,'' said French coach Aime Jacquet.

World Bank says enough rice on hand, but Indonesians lack cash to
</HEADLINE>
buy &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia has enough rice to feed its
population but distribution networks remain disrupted by recent
riots and many people don't have cash to buy enough food, a World
Bank official said Tuesday.
	   The World Bank has warned that Indonesia's economic crisis could
push as many as 50 million people below the poverty line, and other
reports put the figure much higher.
	   ``If you're unemployed, it doesn't matter if the shops are full
of food,'' said Dennis de Tray, head of the World Bank's office in
Indonesia. ``If you don't have any income, you can't buy it.''
	   On Sunday, President B.J. Habibie urged Indonesians to fast
twice a week during daylight hours to save 3 million tons of rice,
roughly the amount that the country has had to import this year.
	   De Tray said enough rice was on hand, much of it provided by
international agencies after the worst drought in 50 years crippled
harvests in the past year. However, the rupiah has plunged more
than 80 percent in value since July 1997, stripping Indonesians of
their purchasing power.
	   De Tray said May riots over price increases in Jakarta and other
cities have disrupted distribution networks previously run by
ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs.
	   Many Chinese whose shops and homes were attacked during the
riots fled and have yet to return. They are often targeted in times
of social turmoil, resented for their relative wealth and alleged
ties to corrupt government figures.
	   Joining de Tray at a news conference, the World Bank's director
for East Asia and the Pacific, Jean-Michel Severino, said his
agency was committed to a dlrs 43 billion aid program led by the
International Monetary Fund.
	   ``We are going to put our money where our mouth is,'' he said.
	   He acknowledged that an extra dlrs 4 billion to dlrs 6 billion
in aid would be needed to cover Indonesia's predicted budget
deficit, but said industrial nations were determined to help cover
the shortfall.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi has
undergone successful surgery to repair a hip broken when he was
exercising, the official Libyan news agency said Tuesday.
	   The operation was `` successfully conducted'' Monday night by
Libyan surgeons, the agency said, but gave no further details.
	   On Monday, Gadhafi, 56, appeared in a live broadcast on
state-run television and said that he broke a bone near his hip
while exercising. He delivered the announcement to viewers while
reclining on a hospital bed, draped in a white sheet.
	   Gadhafi was supposed to lead prayers to mark the birthday of
Prophet Mohammed, but the injury prevented him from doing so.
	   A doctor, who did not identify himself, described the injury as
a ``straightforward fracture.'' He displayed X-rays showing the top
of the femur, the leg bone that extends from the knee to the hip.

Thai teacher detained after taking principal hostage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A divorced teacher angry at his
ex-wife, also a teacher, took the principal of her school hostage
when he was prevented from seeing her on school grounds.
	   Phiphob Thinnopphakhun, 44, was being held by police Tuesday in
the northern city of Chiang Rai on charges of illegal possession of
a firearm and detention of another person.
	   The primary school students ran for cover Monday when Phiphob,
who taught at another school, pulled a pistol and fired two shots
in the air when the principal told him his ex-wife was on vacation.
	   Phiphob took the principal hostage but freed him after two hours
of negotiation with police. He left the school grounds on a
motorcycle, tailed by police vehicles, then hijacked a bus and told
the driver to take him to his parents' home.
	   Police surrounded the house and, after more negotiations,
eventually overpowered Phiphob. Police said he appeared to have
been under the influence of amphetamines.

 &UR; German job market `unusually strong' in June, labor office says &QL;

 &UR; By ANNE THOMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Germany's job market showed ``unusually strong''
improvement in June, due partly to an upswing in the German
economy, Labor Office President Bernhard Jagoda said Tuesday.
	   Confirming figures released last week by Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
who is seeking to bolster a sagging re-election bid, Jagoda said
unemployment dropped to 10.5 percent last month from 10.9 percent
in May.
	   Despite the improvement, jobless protesters rallied in cities
and towns around Germany in what has become a regular monthly event
timed to the release of unemployment figures.
	   ``Talk about improvement is just an election campaign strategy.
That's why we're continuing to protest,'' said protest coordinator
Uwe Kantelhardt.
	   He said that up to 50,000 people participated in 300 protests
nationwide _ about average since the monthly rallies started in
January.
	   In Berlin, protesters marched outside the central unemployment
office. In Nuremberg, headquarters for the federal labor office,
protesters marched past luxury stores to emphasize what they say is
a growing disparity between rich and poor in Germany.
	   Total unemployed in June dropped 122,300 to 4.075 million _ an
improvement beyond what could be expected through seasonal factors
alone, Jagoda said. When adjusted for seasonal factors, the number
of unemployed fell 49,000 in June from May.
	   In addition to Germany's economic upswing, Jagoda credited an
expansion of government job-creation programs and a gradual decline
in the number of people looking for work.
	   Eastern Germany saw its first decline in nearly three years in
the monthly figures, compared to the year before. The former
communist states had an unemployment rate of 17.2 percent in June,
compared to 17.5 percent in June 1997.
	   However, the rate was still nearly double the 8.9 percent logged
in western Germany.
	   Germany's high joblessness has been the key campaign issue in
this year's federal election, set for Sept. 27.
	   Kohl, who has been trailing his Social Democratic challenger,
Gerhard Schroeder, in the polls for months, has presented the
latest declines _ from a high of 12.6 percent early this year _ as
evidence that his policies were taking hold.
	   ``The job figures show without a doubt that our reforms are
paying off,'' Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt said.
	   The Social Democrats, however, claim the improvement is due
mainly to temporary make-work measures financed by the government,
and not real recovery in the labor market.

Vietnam, Laos sign agreements on cooperation in four areas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Laos and Vietnam have signed cooperation
agreements on transportation, power, justice and drug control at
the start of a weeklong visit by Laotian Prime Minister Sisavath
Keobounphanh.
	   The Saigon Times reported Tuesday that the power agreement calls
for Vietnam to buy 390 megawatts of electricity from Laos in the
year 2000, gradually increasing the volume to 2,000 megawatts.
	   The two countries will cooperate in construction of Vung Ang
port in central Vietnam and a road linking it with Laos. They
already have been cooperating in cross-border drug-control efforts.
	   Keobounphanh said after the signing ceremony Monday that he
wants to make bilateral cooperation more effective. He later
visited families of victims of a May plane crash in Laos that
killed 14 senior Vietnamese military officials.
	   Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai, who gave his
counterpart a red-carpet welcome and a brotherly embrace, called
the visit ``an important landmark'' in the neighboring countries'
relationship.
	   Vietnam and Laos maintained close ties during their fight for
independence and in national reconstruction. Both launched a
restructuring process in the mid-1980s and have given priority to
business-oriented relations since then.
	   They have extensively exchanged high-level visits and swapped
experiences in building their countries in the context of one-party
rule.
	   They maintain very good political relations, though their trade
and investment relations are very modest.

Pope calls for new commitment to Sunday Mass, rest day
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIEL J. WAKIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Concerned by the declining number of Sunday
church-goers, Pope John Paul II issued a sweeping call for Roman
Catholics to respect the Lord's day.
	   In a letter released Tuesday, he urged believers not to confuse
``the celebration of Sunday'' with a ```weekend,' understood as a
time of simple rest and relaxation.''
	   Those who don't go to Mass regularly ``should be convinced that
they cannot live their faith or share fully in the life of the
Christian community,'' he said.
	   The custom of the ``weekend'' and a declining sense of faith
have kept people out of church, the pope said.
	   Vatican officials at a news conference to introduce the
apostolic letter, ``The Day of the Lord,'' gave examples: in
Austria, only 17 percent attend Mass; in Rome itself, 28 percent.
	   The percentage drops significantly in some Latin American
countries, where there are major shortages of priests for large
Roman Catholic populations.
	   The document offers John Paul's vision of the meaning of
Sundays. It was formulated by his years as archbishop in Krakow,
Poland, and regular Sunday visits to Rome parishes as pope, he
said.
	   There were ``positive aspects'' to taking part in cultural,
political or sporting activities on Sundays, John Paul said. But
families also should gather in prayer, perform charitable works or
get out and discover nature on Sunday -- a day he called ``an
indispensable element of our Christian identity.''
	   For those who couldn't attend Mass, watching the celebration on
television or listening on radio are a ``precious help,'' though
not a substitute. People should go to Mass at their parish, or go
to a local church while away from home.
	   He urged the use of high quality music, to ensure a ``festive
character appropriate to commemorating the Lord's Resurrection.''
Masses for children are a good idea. ``Small group Masses are not
to be encouraged,'' he said.
	   The 100-page letter is filled with references to the Bible,
ancient Roman and early Christian writers and philosophical
reflections. He traces the history of the ``day of rest'' and its
origins in the Jewish Sabbath.

Japanese gangster found dead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A fugitive Japanese gangster accused
of killing a top mob boss was found dead in a hideout in Seoul,
South Korean police said Tuesday.
	   Kazutoshi Yoshino, 47, had been on the run from Japanese police
since the August 1997 murder of Masaru Takumi, leader of the
Yamaguchi-gumi, Japan's largest underworld syndicate.
	   Bleeding from his nose, Yoshino was found lying dead on his bed
in a Seoul apartment Monday by a South Korean friend, police said.
They identified the friend only by his last name, Kim.
	   Officials at Seoul's Kangnam Police Station would not comment on
the possible cause of Yoshino's death pending an autopsy later this
week.
	   The national news agency Yonhap, quoting police sources,
reported Yoshino apparently died of a cerebral hemorrhage. Police
found no evidence of a break-in, it said.
	   Yoshino was believed to be one of the five gangsters who were
dressed as uniformed blue-collar workers and gunned down Takumi in
a crowded hotel cafe in Kobe, central Japan, last August.
	   After the killing, Yoshino fled to South Korea's southern port
city of Pusan, where his Korean wife reportedly lived.
	   The mob boss was believed killed in a dispute between rival
factions of his gang. Yoshino was a senior member of the Nakano-kai
faction of the Yamaguchi-gumi. After the shooting, Yoshino's
faction was expelled from the group.
	   The Yamaguchi-gumi claims a membership of 23,000 gangsters, or
``yakuza'' as they are called, who engage in businesses, both legal
and illegal, including drug-trafficking, gun-smuggling,
prostitution, extortion and real-estate swindles.

 &UR; Prime minister invites pope to Romania &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Romania's prime minister invited Pope John
Paul II to visit the predominantly Orthodox country, extending
invitations Tuesday from both the president and the Orthodox
patriarch.
	   Up to now, opposition from the Orthodox church has apparently
held up a visit as in other countries in eastern Europe where
friction between Orthodox Christians and Roman Catholics developed
following the fall of communism.
	   The Vatican gave no details on the pope's meeting with Prime
Minister Radu Vasile.
	   An official at Romania's embassy to the Holy See, Laura Mircea,
said Vasile carried a written invitation from President Emil
Constantinescu and a verbal one from Romanian Orthodox Patriarch
Teoctist.
	   The end of restrictions on religion following communism's fall
has led to disputes over property rights and accusations of
overzealous missionary work by Catholics in eastern Europe.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A decade ago, it seemed nothing could
come between Buddhi Kota Subbarao and a successful physics career.
He was headed to the United States to work with telecommunications
giant AT and T and hoped to develop India's first nuclear submarine
when he returned.
	   Everything changed on May 30, 1988. As he prepared to board a
plane at Bombay airport for his trip to America, a customs officer
demanded Subbarao open his briefcase and found a sheaf of documents
on nuclear reactors. Subbarao was charged with spying.
	   It took five years _ more than two of them spent in jail _ for
Subbarao to clear himself. Now a lawyer, Subbarao wants more
justice. He is determined to put India's notoriously slow and
overburdened justice system, which he blames in part for his
ordeal, on trial.
	   The documents on nuclear reactors _ his doctoral thesis that he
wanted U.S. scholars to review _ were found to be unclassified.
Subbarao suspects airport customs officials were tipped off as part
of a conspiracy. But he never found evidence that powerful
officials tried to frame him.
	   In May, Subbarao wrote to President K.R. Narayanan accusing two
Supreme Court judges who handled his case, retired Chief Justice
A.M. Ahmadi and the judge set to become the next chief, A.S. Anand,
of ignoring evidence.
	   Ahmadi was unavailable for comment. Anand, like other judges in
India, does not speak to the press.
	   Narayanan referred the petition to federal government officials
to determine what, if any, action should be taken. Subbarao's plea
to the president may eventually be lost in the Indian bureaucratic
labyrinth, but it could revive interest in a case that once won the
backing of leading civil rights campaigners and constitutional
experts.
	   Usha Mehta, a civil rights activist who led a campaign on
Subbarao's behalf in 1988, is among those convinced he was the
victim of a conspiracy. Judges erred by failing to fully study the
evidence or because they lacked ``the courage to act against the
injustice,'' she said.
	   In 1976, Subbarao, then a 39-year-old physicist and navy
captain, began work on a nuclear submarine being developed by the
navy and the Bhabha Atomic Research Center, known as BARC. He says
he pointed out flaws in the designs of BARC scientists that
eventually led the late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to cut off
funds.
	   Subbarao quit the navy a few years later. He submitted his own
submarine design as a doctoral thesis, earning a degree in 1985.
	   Shortly before Subbarao's arrest, Rajiv Gandhi, who had
succeeded his mother as prime minister, revived the nuclear
submarine project. Subbarao said Rajiv Gandhi asked him to lead it,
but the government's confirmation process was never completed.
	   ``BARC already had an animosity for me,'' Subbarao said in a
telephone interview from his home in Bombay. ``When Rajiv Gandhi
tried to give me the command of the project, they conspired to
destroy me.''
	   Raja Ramanna, regarded as one of the pioneers of India's atomic
research program, was chief of BARC at the time. He refused to
comment on Subbarao's claims.
	   Subbarao says reporters, judges, prosecutors and his lawyer did
not understand the thesis police said contained military secrets.
He believes special courts should be established so that experts
can help judge technical cases.
	   This year, the Supreme Court acquitted two rocket experts who
were accused of heading a ring of spies in space laboratories in
southern India, allegedly working for rival Pakistan. The
scientists had been on trial for four years.
	   Jane's Intelligence Review reported in June that India is
expected to produce its first nuclear submarine by 2004.

MCI-Worldcom merger to get EU go-ahead, official says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ European Union regulators are scheduled
Wednesday to approve the dlrs 37 billion merger between U.S.
telecommunications groups MCI Communications Corp. and Worldcom
Inc., a senior EU official said here Tuesday.
	   ``Tomorrow, the Commission will announce the green light,'' EU
Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert said. ``There is no
problem any more on MCI.''
	   The European Commission, the EU's 20-member executive body, is
to hold its regular weekly meeting in Brussels on Wednesday to
approve the deal, he said.
	   Van Miert was speaking in Lisbon where he is attending a seminar
on anti-trust policy.
	   Under EU rules, the Commission checks mergers with a major
impact on markets within the 15-nation bloc and can demand changes
to, or veto, those it judges to infringe European laws governing
fair competition.
	   MCI has agreed to divest all overlapping businesses, primarily
the entire MCI Internet business. The EU conditions include retail
level Internet assets, Van Miert said.
	   MCI and Worldcom are the second- and fourth-largest
long-distance telephone companies in the United States. Their
alliance, proposed in November, would surpass Bell Atlantic's dlrs
25.6 billion 1997 takeover of Nynex and continue the global trend
toward consolidation of the telecommunications industry.
	   Van Miert stressed that EU authorities have cooperated closely
with the U.S. Department of Justice, which is also looking into the
planned merger.
	   The link-up now awaits the conclusion of the U.S. antitrust
investigation.

Report: man blows up neighbor's apartment after washing machine
</HEADLINE>
dispute &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A Ukrainian man set off an explosive device
that injured his neighbor and damaged an apartment following a
dispute over the use of a washing machine, a newspaper said
Tuesday.
	   The man allegedly planted 200 grams (7 ounces) of explosives at
the entrance of his neighbor's apartment in the eastern town of
Antratsyt. The blast destroyed the door and damaged the kitchen.
The apartment owner was injured by flying shards of glass and had
to be hospitalized, the daily Segodnya reported.
	   Before the blast, the neighbors had argued over the use of a
washing machine in the apartment that was later damaged. The
neighbors had shared the washing machine in the past, but the
owners refused to allow their neighbor to use it this time, the
newspaper said.
	   Upset because he could not use the machine, the man threatened
to blow up the apartment and returned later with the explosives,
the report added.
	   The names of those involved were not given.

Protestants attack police over Portadown Orangemen's blocked march

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Protestants determined to
overturn a ban on an Orange Order march attacked police overnight
in Belfast with bullets, rocks, gasoline bombs and grenades in the
most serious street violence since April's peace agreement.
	   The British army announced Tuesday it was deploying an extra two
battalions of soldiers to Northern Ireland after a second night of
widespread protests and mob violence in Protestant districts.
	   The Orange Order, Northern Ireland's conservative Protestant
brotherhood, appealed for nonviolent protests only against Sunday's
ban on their annual march through the main Catholic section of
Portadown, 30 miles (50 kms) southwest of Belfast.
	   But Britain's minister responsible for governing Northern
Ireland, Mo Mowlam, said Orangemen should ``recognize that there
are sinister elements who are using their protest to attack the
security forces.''
	   The imminent deployment of the first battalions of the elite
Parachute Regiment and King's Regiment by plane from England _
swelling the combined strength of police and troops here to more
than 30,000 _ underscored British resolve to quell the mayhem
before it turns deadly.

UNHCR preparing to protect operations if Croatia wins World Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The U.N. refugee agency said Tuesday it is
preparing to protect its refugee return operations in Bosnia
against outbreaks of ethnic violence if Croatia's football team
wins the World Cup.
	   ``We have been doing some contingency planning to safeguard some
of our return projects in areas which might be targeted by people
celebrating an eventual victory,'' said UNHCR spokeswoman Judith
Kumin.
	   A UNHCR water tanker and two buses used to return refugees were
destroyed in the southern, Croat-held town of Stolac on July 2 as
Bosnian Croat celebrations of Croatia's 3-0 World Cup victory
against Germany turned violent, Kumin said.
	   Some 200 Bosnian Croats marched through a street where Bosnian
Muslims are rebuilding homes, throwing stones and breaking windows,
Kumin said.
	   Local police were present during the incident but did not
intervene in time to prevent the damage, Kumin said.
	   The Stolac area, located 115 kilometers (72 miles) southwest of
the Bosnian capital Sarajevo, is one of the worst hot-spots of
continued ethnic violence against refugees in Bosnia.
	   So far, only around 400 of some 8,000 refugees who fled the town
during the war between Bosnian Croats and Muslims have been able to
return, Kumin said.
	   Ethnic violence has been orchestrated by Croat hard-liners since
the end of the war in 1995, to prevent Muslim refugees from
reclaiming homes they were forced to leave in 1993.
	   In other parts of the country, Bosnian Serb or Muslim
hard-liners have used similar methods to prevent refugees from
returning.
	   Violence following Croatia's victory also flared in other parts
of Bosnia. In the divided city of Mostar, a 25-year-old Muslim
woman was killed and a man was seriously wounded on the Muslim side
when they were hit by bullets fired in celebration from the Croat
side, Bosnian radio reported.

Dutch carrier to repurchase common shares from government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ KLM Royal Dutch Airlines said
Tuesday it will buy back 8.47 million common shares from the Dutch
government.
	   KLM did not detail terms of the repurchase, which will leave the
Dutch government with a 14 percent voting stake in the national
carrier.
	   Under the move, the airline also will purchase 4.84 million
participation certificates from the KLM Flight Personnel Pension
Fund Foundation.
	   The price KLM will pay for the government-held shares will be
determined by the trading value of the shares on the stock exchange
on Aug. 6, 7, 10 and 11, KLM said in a statement.
	   KLM shares surged Tuesday on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange on
news of the buyback. As of noon GMT, shares were trading up 7.3
percent at 91.70 guilders (dlrs 44.82).
	   In May, KLM posted a net profit for fiscal 1998 of 2.2 billion
guilders (dlrs 1.1 billion), up from 236 million guilders (dlrs 118
million) in the previous year.

Israeli ministers: Agreement on West Bank withdrawal soon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HILARY APPELMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Declaring it a ``moment of truth,'' Israeli
Cabinet ministers said Tuesday that they expected a long-awaited
agreement on a West Bank troop withdrawal in the coming days or
weeks.
	   Agriculture Minister Rafael Eitan, meanwhile, joined the call
for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to hold early elections.
Eitan opposes any West Bank withdrawal and has said he will
challenge Netanyahu in the next elections, scheduled for 2000.
	   ``It's better to go to the polls now, standing tall, and let the
nation decide, than to wait and squirm,'' he told The Associated
Press.
	   Israeli and Palestinian radio reports Tuesday said U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had spoken by telephone in
recent days and Albright had said she believed an agreement was
near.
	   The United States is pushing Netanyahu to accept a U.S. plan for
an Israeli withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank, but several
months have passed without a response from the prime minister. Arab
leaders have warned that the lack of movement and growing tensions
could lead to violence.
	   Mohammed Dahlan, a Palestinian security chief in the autonomous
Gaza Strip, said Tuesday that the situation in the
Palestinian-controlled areas was ``ripe for an explosion.''
	   Israel's refusal to carry out the withdrawal ``will push the
Palestinians into a corner and encourage extremists,'' he said.
	   Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, speaking to reporters during
a visit to an army base near the West Bank town of Bethlehem, said
Tuesday that he expected a decision on an agreement in ``a few
days.''
	   ``This is the moment of truth,'' he said.
	   Mordechai added, however, that it would take more time to work
out details and implement any agreement.
	   Trade Minister Natan Sharansky, while denying reports that he
had given Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a Friday deadline for a
decision on an agreement, said ``We are very close to the end.''
	   ``We are very close to exhausting the possibilities in the
negotiations,'' he said. ``If we can sign an agreement, so much the
better, and if not we have to make public precisely where we stand,
what we have done, and who is to blame.''
	   Sharansky said there cannot be an agreement until Israel
receives ``satisfactory answers'' from the Palestinians on
fulfilling their commitments under past agreements. But he added,
``We cannot sit waiting for answers for eternity.''
	   Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani said the agreement
would ``stand or fall'' during the month of July.
	   ``If there is no agreement, the prime minister will have to tell
the people of Israel the reasons why.''
	   Initially, Netanyahu said he could not accept the U.S. plan
because the 13 percent figure was too high, but in recent weeks he
has insisted that the only obstacle to agreement was the
Palestinians' failure to make concrete commitments to carry out
their obligation to fight terrorism.

Balkan contact group expected to call for Kosovo cease-fire
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Seeking to get peace talks started in Serbia's
rebellious Kosovo province, the six-nation Contact Group for the
Balkans is expected to back off demands for an immediate withdrawal
of Serb forces and call instead on both sides to agree to a
cease-fire.
	   Diplomats in Bonn, where the Contact Group meets on Wednesday,
and Washington have signaled the shift in recent days, amid
continued fighting in the province between Serb forces and ethnic
Albanian separatists.
	   Among demands the group made at its June 12 meeting in London
was that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic order his special
forces to return to their bases. He has refused to do so, citing
continued attacks by the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA).
	   While the Contact Group is not expected to drop its demand for
withdrawal, diplomats say there is increasing recognition that a
cease-fire is needed first. An internationally monitored truce
would ensure that the KLA does not seize the opportunity of a troop
withdrawal to rush in and gain more territory in Kosovo.
	   Also expected to be debated in Bonn are recent American contacts
with purported Kosovo Liberation Army leaders. Only a few months
ago, Washington had referred to the KLA as terrorists.
	   The Americans are now proposing a seat at the negotiating table
for the KLA alongside Ibrahim Rugova, the pacifist moderate who
many ethnic Albanians look to as their leader.
	   The Contact Group _ the United States, Russia, Britain, Germany,
France and Italy _ has an international mandate to monitor events
in former Yugoslavia.

Cloned calves using adults' ear, muscle cells expected in December
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Only days after the birth of the world's first
calves cloned from an adult cow, another group of Japanese
scientists said Tuesday that calves cloned from cells from adults'
ears and buttocks could be born as early as December.
	   If the experiment succeeds, these calves would be the first
clones from adult somatic cells other than ova or oviduct cells,
said the Nara State Livestock Research Center in western Japan.
	   On Sunday, another Japanese livestock research center announced
the birth of two adult-cow clones, produced with a technique
similar to that used for Dolly, the British sheep that made history
by becoming the first adult-animal clone.
	   At the Nara center, five surrogate cows are pregnant, with
delivery expected between mid-December and mid-January, said center
spokesman Katsuhiko Hata.
	   The center took cells from ears and buttock muscles and somatic
cells from adult Japanese beef cows as well as a Holstein fetus,
and placed them in unfertilized eggs whose own nuclei had been
removed.
	   Then artificially cultivated embryos were placed into the wombs
of 13 cows in February, Hata said. Seven of them became pregnant,
but two suffered miscarriages, he said.
	   ``We are currently in the process of experimenting with cells
taken from various parts of adult cows to figure out the most
effective way to produce adult-clone calves,'' Hata said.
	   Cloning an adult is better than relying on the relative
uncertainty of cells from a fetus, because scientists can select
adults that have already proved their ability to produce more milk
or high quality beef.
	   ``The next step is to find ways that are the least stressful to
cows,'' he said in a telephone interview from his center, about 430
kilometers (260 miles) southwest of Tokyo.
	   On Feb. 16, scientists in the United States produced a clone
calf _ a Holstein named Gene _ but Gene's genes originated in a
cell from a 30-day-old fetus rather than an adult cell.

Oil officials: Iraq restores pipeline via Syria
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq has completed repairs on its part of
an oil pipeline that runs through neighboring Syria and can carry
up to 650,000 barrels a day, Oil Ministry officials said Tuesday.
	   But Syria has yet to give permission for the oil to pass.
	   The pipeline system was restored after the rehabilitation of a
pumping station and sections damaged during the 1991 Gulf War, said
the officials, who asked not to be identified.
	   Repairs were also carried out on storage tanks and measuring
equipment at the strategic Haditha pumping facility, which Iraq
uses to transport oil from northern fields to southern terminals.
	   The pipeline links Iraq's Kirkuk oil fields to the Mediterranean
terminals of Banias in Syria and Tripoli in Lebanon.
	   Syria closed the line in April 1982, dealing a severe blow to
Iraq which was then involved in a war with Iran. Syria sided with
non-Arab Iran in the 1980-1988 war.
	   The officials said they have raised the pipeline issue with
Syrian officials, but have not yet received an answer.
	   But Arab diplomats in Baghdad, also speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Syria is using part of the pipeline network to
transport about 450,000 barrels daily of its own crude.
	   Iraq said Monday it has boosted the capacity of its main oil
terminal on the Gulf to 1.8 million barrels a day. The repair of
the Syrian pipeline suggests that the export capacity at Iraq's
disposal is more than the limited quantities it is allowed to
export under its oil-for-food deal with the United Nations.
	   U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq for invading Kuwait in 1990 bar
its oil exports apart from those amounts, whose proceeds must be
used to purchase food, medicine and other humanitarian goods.

EU takes Ireland to court over water pollution, warns five
</HEADLINE>
countries

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union's executive
Commission said Tuesday it will take Ireland to court for failing
to integrate EU norms on water pollution into national legislation.
	   The Commission also warned Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, Austria
and the Netherlands it would take them before the European Court of
Justice if they fail to adopt EU standards on water pollution
within the next two months.
	   Ireland will be sued for not adopting EU rules on the protection
of water against pollution caused by substances such as mineral
oils, hydrocarbons, and various heavy metals such as phosphorus and
nitrites.
	   The Commission threatened to take Belgium, Luxembourg and
Germany to court if they failing to adopt EU laws on water
pollution caused by nitrates from agriculture, the Commission said.
	   Under an EU law on nitrates, EU countries were expected by 1993
to identify zones affected by nitrate-related pollution and set up
programs to tackle the pollution by 1995.
	   The Commission warned Austria and the Netherlands for violating
EU norms on the quality and regular monitoring of bathing water.
	   The Netherlands should have met these standards by 1985. In the
case of Austria, the proper legislation should have been adopted by
Jan. 1, 1997.
	   The European Court of Justice is based in Luxembourg.

 &UR; Summary executions highlight launch of Kosovo observer mission
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with overnight fighting; trims.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police battling ethnic Albanian
insurgents near one of Kosovo's largest cities gained ground
against the rebels after overnight battles, Serb sources reported
Tuesday.
	   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said fighting
in the region near the southwestern city of Pec appeared to be
continuing Tuesday. But with phone lines cut and the main road
leading into are sealed off by Serb police for security reasons,
the report could not be verified.
	   The fighting flared Monday, with the ethnic-Albanian-run Kosovo
Information Center reporting one person killed and three wounded by
heavy shelling of Lodja village, near Pec.
	   Serb sources said armed Albanians opened fire on Serb villagers,
forcing a Serb counter-attack.
	   The pro-government Serb Media Center reported two policemen
killed and six others wounded in the fighting at Lodja.
	   Closer to Pristina, tensions were high in the 3,000-member
community of Pirane, 75 kilometers (45 miles) southwest of the
provincial capital, following the burials of three ethnic Albanian
farmers.
	   Official Serb reports said the three were murdered by their own
people for betraying them. But the villagers say the slayings are
the handiwork of Serb police.
	   The contradictory allegations highlight the constant conflicting
propaganda in Serbia's disputed Kosovo province, where ethnic
Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1. Western diplomats hope to bring
some clarity to the confusion with the launch this week of a
multi-national observer mission.
	   Since Serb forces launched a crackdown on ethnic Albanian
militants on Feb. 28, a tangle of roadblocks have prevented any
outside observers from confirming reports of fighting. Information
is largely channeled through centers representing either side.
	   The relatives' claims of summary execution by police came hours
after the Serb Media Center, which compiles official Serb
information, told reporters that ethnic Albanian militants killed
the three with automatic weapons because they were loyal to the
Serbs. Serbia is one of the two remaining republics in Yugoslavia.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo. Recent attempts
to bring ethnic Albanian leaders and the Yugoslav government to the
negotiating table have produced few results.
	   Western observers, Belgrade-based diplomats from the United
States, Russia, Poland and the European Union will regularly tour
villages in Kosovo to try and clarify the situation on the ground.
	   They also will share information with humanitarian organizations
struggling to cope with a flood of refugees and conflicts in the
remote Kosovo mountains where neighboring Serb and ethnic Albanian
villages form a checkerboard of front lines.

Fiorentina signs national team defender
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FLORENCE, Italy (AP) _ Fiorentina has signed Italian national
team defender Moreno Torricelli, the Serie A club announced
Tuesday.
	   Torricelli, 28, spent the past six seasons with Juventus of
Turin, helping the team take three league titles and one European
Champions Cup trophy.
	   He signed a four-year deal with Fiorentina, worth 1.7 billion
lire (dlrs 1 million) per season. Fiorentina acquired him from
Juventus for a reported transfer fee of 12 billion lire (about dlrs
7 million).
	   He will help bolster a sometimes-shaky defense at Fiorentina,
which boasts Argentina's Gabriel Batistuta in attack.

 &UR; Controversial power plant to be fully on line by August

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Personnel at a nuclear plant
considered unsafe by neighboring Austria increased its output on
Tuesday and said the plant would be fully operational by the end of
August.
	   The second of the Mochovce plant's two generators was turned on
Tuesday, after the first generator was made operational on the
weekend, feeding 30 megawatts into the country's electric grid,
plant spokesman Rastislav Petrech said.
	   ``We want to have it ready for the winter season,'' Petrech
said, announcing that the 440-megawatt plant would go fully on line
by late August.
	   The plant is just 120 kilometers (72 miles) east of Austria,
which has campaigned strongly against its activation, arguing that
certain features of the heavy water pressure reactor make it
unsafe.
	   Austria is the only country in the world to have built a nuclear
power plant, then mothballed it after voting in 1978 by referendum
against putting it online or having nuclear power.
	   Mochovce is a Soviet-designed plant subsequently equipped with
Western technology. In May, a team of 22 international experts
inspected the plant and noted safety changes made at the station,
but also complained that the company operating it had failed to
release necessary documents.
	   Austria is worried that a Chernobyl-type disaster at Mochovce _
or other nuclear plants in neighboring Slovakia and the Czech
Republic _ would have affect hundreds of thousands of its citizens.
	   Austria is particularly worried that the Czech-produced pressure
vessel made of special steel is safe for only the first five years,
and that nuclear reaction will weaken its quality. Slovak officials
dismiss all the Austrian criticism.

Official warns against impending eruption of Merapi in Central Java
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Mount Merapi, a volcano in Central
Java, appears ready to erupt, a news report said Tuesday.
	   An alert went into effect last Thursday after indications of
shallow tremors that sent a huge amount of magma close to the top
of the 2,968-meter (9,737-foot) mountain, the official Antara news
agency said.
	   Its last eruption killed nearly 70 people in 1994.
	   Antara quoted Mas Atje Purbawinata, head of the volcanology
office in the nearby city of Yogyakarta, as saying the tremors
could cause lava accumulated in the crater to slide down.
	   Yogyakarta is about 400 kilometers (250 miles) southeast of
Jakarta.
	   Merapi is the most active among 500 volcanoes in Indonesia, the
world's largest archipelago nation, with about 17,000 islands.
	   The nation's last major volcanic eruption, on Mount Galunggung
in West Java in 1982, killed more than 100 people.

EU official reveals conditions for BA-American Airlines alliance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The European Union will ask British
Airways and American Airlines to give up 267 slots at London's
Heathrow and Gatwick airports in return for Brussels' backing their
planned linkup, an EU official said Tuesday.
	   EU Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert said the European
Commission was also examining other aspects of the planned
mega-alliance, including the frequency of flights on individual
transatlantic routes and joint marketing.
	   Van Miert was attending a competition seminar in Lisbon. His
comments came the day before the EU Commission, the 15-nation
bloc's executive body, was due to make a preliminary ruling on the
BA-American linkup.
	   The Commission was also expected to make an announcement
Wednesday on a separate, existing alliance involving Lufthansa and
United Airlines.
	   Van Miert said the EU would call for the Star Alliance between
Lufthansa and United to give up 108 slots at Frankfurt airport.
	   The BA-American Airlines link has long given the EU head office
headaches because of antitrust issues.
	   The Commissioner has previously said all transatlantic airline
alliances under review will likely have to cede airport slots to
get the EU regulatory all-clear.
	   Without such a move, airlines would end up with an iron grip on
the best slots at the best airports on both sides of the Atlantic.

Thousands attend funeral of slain lawmaker
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos available. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Several thousand people, including military
officers and lawmakers, attended a funeral ceremony Tuesday for Lev
Rokhlin, an ex-general turned lawmaker who was among President
Boris Yeltsin's most outspoken foes.
	   Rokhlin, 51, was killed at his country home last Friday. His
wife, Tamara, confessed to the killing and was detained the same
day, police said. She said she killed her husband with his pistol
while he was sleeping, and her fingerprints were on the weapon,
according to police.
	   Mrs. Rokhlin remains in jail and police are continuing to
investigate.
	   Meanwhile, Rokhlin's relatives, opposition leaders and the media
have put forth several alternative scenarios, though none have
provided any evidence to contradict the authorities.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, who attended the mourning
ceremony, accused officials of immediately accepting Tamara
Rokhlin's confession to avoid a ``complicated investigation,'' the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   Ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky blamed Russian authorities
for the murder, though he also claimed that the secret services of
an unspecified ``Middle East country'' might be involved.
	   The Rokhlin's daughter, Yelena, claimed that Mrs. Rokhlin
professed her innocence shortly before her arrest. But Mrs. Rokhlin
agreed to confess to the killing to protect the family from the
unidentified assailants who threatened to strike again if they were
accused.
	   ``They killed your father. I didn't do that, but I will take all
responsibility to save your lives,'' Yelena quoted her mother as
saying in an interview published in the daily Moskovsky Komsomolets
on Tuesday.
	   Police have given no credence to the other theories so far.
	   Rokhlin, a career soldier, won nationwide acclaim for his
performance at the beginning of the 1994-96 war in Chechnya, where
he led Russian troops who initially captured the Chechen capital
Grozny.
	   He later rejected a medal for valor in combat, saying he didn't
want to be decorated for a war that involved attacks on fellow
Russian citizens.
	   He was elected to parliament's lower house in 1995, serving with
a pro-government faction and heading the defense affairs committee.
He gained popularity by exposing military corruption.
	   But last year, he became increasingly critical of President
Boris Yeltsin's government. Rokhlin founded a movement called
Support for the Armed Forces, with the aim of ousting Yeltsin.
	   Last fall, Rokhlin claimed that authorities had a plan to
discredit him, and if that failed ``attempts on my physical
elimination or destroying my health are likely to be taken as an
extreme measure.''

Sudanese foreign minister on five-day visit to Malaysia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Sudan's foreign minister met with
Malaysian officials Tuesday on a five-day visit to boost foreign
investment in the poverty-stricken African country.
	   Mustafa Osman Ismail, whose delegation included Sudan Central
Bank Governor Sabir Mohammed Elhassan and other senior officials,
met with his Malaysian counterpart Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and
Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Abdul Hamid Othman.
	   Abdul Hamid said Sudan agreed to provide land to two Malaysian
companies planning to set up plantations in the country, which is
the largest in Africa and one of the poorest.
	   PadiBeras Nasional will begin rice cultivation in Sudan and
Tabung Haji Plantation will grow oil palm, Abdul Hamid said.
Further details of the deal were not available.
	   Sudan imports 73,100 tons of palm oil and olein annually, 44,913
tons of which came from Malaysia last year.
	   Malaysia's foreign minister told reporters that Sudan had
expressed interest in buying palm oil on credit from Malaysia and
that Malaysia was considering buying cooking oil, beef and mutton
from Sudan.
	   The Sudanese visit was a follow-up to one by Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad in May.
	   Mustafa is to meet with Mahathir and Deputy Prime Minister Anwar
Ibrahim during his visit.
	   On Wednesday, he is to meet with Transport Minister Ling Liong
Sik. They are expected to discuss an air cooperation agreement
between Malaysia airlines and Sudan's national carrier.

	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ A private car Tuesday slammed into a vehicle
which was part of a motorcade for the visiting Turkish prime minister,
killing two people and injuring five others, Macedonian radio reported.
	   Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz was not injured, the report said. But
Turkish cabinet minister Rustu Kazim Yucelen and three other members of the
Turkish delegation were hurt. Their conditions were not reported.
	   The two dead -- including the woman driver and her companion -- were in a
Czech-made car with Macedonian plates. 
	   State-run Macedonian Radio said the accident occurred near the town of
Bitola, located 100 kilometers (60 miles) south of capital Skopje.
	   Yilmaz was travelling in another car with his Macedonian counterpart,
Branko Crvenkovski.
	   The large Turkish delegation, which included a number of Turkish
businessmen seeking business opportunities and closer ties with the former
Yugoslav republic, eventually reached Bitola where they were to open an
honorary consulate.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police battling ethnic Albanian
insurgents in a village near one of Kosovo's largest cities forced
them to retreat, Serb sources reported Tuesday.
	   The pro-government Serb Media Center said that the Kosovo
Liberation Army retreated from Lodja village overnight in the
region near the southwestern city of Pec. With phone lines cut and
the main road leading into the region sealed off by Serb police for
security reasons, there were few details on the situation Tuesday,
but no new fighting was reported.
	   The fighting flared Monday, with the ethnic-Albanian-run Kosovo
Information Center reporting one person killed and three wounded by
heavy shelling of Lodja village, near Pec.
	   Serb sources said armed Albanians opened fire on Serb villagers,
forcing a Serb counter-attack.
	   The Serb Media Center reported two policemen killed and six
others wounded in the fighting at Lodja. The Media Center said that
11 civilians and two policemen were evacuated overnight from Lodja,
and large quantities of weapons were collected after fleeing KLA
forces left them behind.

Thailand turns back on local content promise made to General
</HEADLINE>
Motors &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand will drop its local content
requirement for the assembly of passenger cars in January 2000, 1
1/2 years later than it promised General Motors when the U.S.
automaker was deciding on a major investment here.
	   Thai economic ministers said in a statement Tuesday that the new
date to lift the requirement would be in compliance with the
requirements of the World Trade Organization.
	   In May 1996, General Motors announced that Thailand had been
chosen over the Philippines as the site for a dlrs 750 million
manufacturing plant that would be the U.S. automaker's first in
Southeast Asia.
	   The only special incentive Thailand had publicly offered GM to
locate here was agreement to the company's request to drop the
local content requirement for cars sold in the country by mid-1998,
instead of 2000 as hoped.
	   Tuesday's announcement of the 2000 date ``might give an
impression that the Thai government cannot keep what it had
promised to foreign investors,'' Kantanit Sukonthasap, vice
president for corporate affairs of General Motors (Thailand), told
Dow Jones Newswires. ``We're rather disappointed by it.''
	   The Philippines had offered infrastructure, five rent-free
years, eight income tax-exempt years, no duty on imports of
machinery, and a waiver of local content rules for export-bound
cars, as well as an English-speaking, better-educated work force.
	   But Thailand's far larger auto market and leadership as
Southeast Asia's auto-manufacturing hub won out.
	   The local market for automobiles has fallen about 70 percent
since the country's economic crisis began last year, however.
	   Kantanit said last month that the opening of the plant in
eastern Thailand would be delayed until the first half of the year
2000 because East Asia's economic crisis has forced the company to
reconsider what model to produce.
	   Initial production at the plant in Rayong province was still
expected to be 40,000 vehicles a year as originally planned, he
said, and about 80 percent of production was earmarked for export.
	   Construction of GM's Rayong factory building, begun in late
1996, was expected to be finished as scheduled by the end of this
year, he said.
	   He also said investment in the plant had been cut to about dlrs
500 million from the originally planned dlrs 750 million.
	   Kantanit said Tuesday that the Thai government also had promised
to give General Motors Thailand dlrs 15 million for training its
staff.
	   ``But now they never talk about it,'' he said. ``We understand
that the Thai government probably doesn't have the money now.''

	   VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP) _ Scotland's Colin Montgomerie took
No.1 position on the PGA European tour money list as he reclaimed
No.1 place in the European rankings at the Irish Open.
	   Montgomerie lost a sudden-death play-off at Druids Glen to David
Carter but the dlrs 177,000 purse for second place was enough to
move him from sixth to first on the money list with dlrs 677,136.
	   Lee Westwood surrendered the No.1 position on the European tour
money list and rankings to Montgomerie and dropped to second place
with dlrs 660,207.
	   South Africa's World No.2 Ernie Els dropped one place on the
European money list to third with dlrs 625,370, while Thomas Bjorn
held fourth place with dlrs 543,600 and Spain's Jose Maria Olazabal
kept fifth place with dlrs 536,193.
	   Irish Open winner David Carter's dlrs 265,587 prize money moved
him into the top ten on the money list for the first time. He holds
eighth place with dlrs 364,617.
	   Craig Hainline of the United States moved from 125th into 54th
place on the money list when he finished fifth at the Irish Open
after sharing the lead at the halfway mark of the tournament.
	   Ireland's John McHenry had not won a cent on tour this season
but his equal-third finish at the Irish Open earned him dlrs 89,633
and moved him into 63rd place on the money list.

Tanzania plans to arrest Rwandan genocide suspects
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ Tanzania has received a list of
suspects believed to have taken part in the 1994 Rwanda genocide
and plans to arrest at least some of them soon, President Benjamin
Mkapa said Tuesday.
	   ``We are following the legal procedures to arrest them,'' Mkapa
told reporters at a joint news conference with Rwandan President
Pasteur Bizimungu. ``But be assured we will do it very soon.''
	   He said the U.N. International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda,
based in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha, sent his government
the list.
	   He did not say how many names were on the list or whether all
would be arrested. At one time, there were almost half a million
Hutu refugees living in camps in northwestern Tanzania.
	   More than 500,000 Rwandan Tutsis and moderate Hutus were
slaughtered during the 1994 genocide orchestrated by an extremist
Hutu government.
	   The nationwide slaughter, carried out by government soldiers and
militias, ended only when Tutsi-led rebels captured the Rwandan
capital Kigali in July 1994 and ousted the government.
	   The U.N. tribunal was established in November 1994 and soon was
the object of harsh criticism because of its inefficiency.
	   The tribunal obtained its first conviction in May this year when
former Rwandan Prime Minister Jean Kambanda pleaded guilty to
charges of genocide and crimes against humanity and offered to
testify against ringleaders of the three-month slaughter.
	   The tribunal has indicted 36 people, 24 of whom are in its
custody.
	   The maximum sentence the tribunal can impose is life in prison.
	   The Rwandan government has imprisoned about 130,000 genocide
suspects _ most without formal charges _ and began trying them in
December 1996. About 350 have been been convicted.
	   A third were sentenced to death. The first 22 were executed by
firing squad on April 24. Most of the others received prison
sentences and a small number were acquitted.

Greece accuses Turkey of stirring up tension in Aegean
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece on Tuesday accused neighboring
Turkey of stirring up tension in the region after Ankara protested
about Greek military presence on Aegean islands.
	   ``Turkey's claims are historically unacceptable and legally
unfounded,'' said government spokesman Dimitris Reppas. ``With this
stance, Turkey is once again dynamiting the efforts being made to
defuse tension in the area.''
	   The military presence in the Aegean is just one of the points of
contention between the rival nations.
	   Ankara issued a verbal note to Greece's ambassador Dimitris
Nezeritis last week, complaining that Greek military presence on
Aegean islands violates the 1923 Lausanne Treaty that defined the
two countries' current border.
	   ``They are arming the islands and tipping the balance in the
Aegean,'' Haldun Otman, a Turkish foreign ministry spokesman, said
Tuesday.
	   Although the Lausanne Treaty does call for the demilitarization
of Aegean islands, Greece claims it is entitled to maintain troops
there for defense reasons in the face of a perceived Turkish
threat.
	   Ankara has disputed the sovereignty of a number of islands and
rocks in the sea separating Greece and Turkey, and the two NATO
allies almost went to war in 1996 over the rocky islet of Imia, or
Kardak in Turkish.
	   ``Each country ... has the right to organize its defense in the
best possible manner,'' Reppas said, adding that the strong Turkish
military presence on its Aegean coast and Turkey's continued
occupation of Cyprus make defense measures imperative.
	   Cyprus has been divided since a 1974 Turkish invasion sparked by
a Greek-backed coup in favor of union with Greece.
	   ``This development is negative to peace and stability in the
region,'' Reppas added. ``We believe that Turkey, which made this
complaint without any reason or cause, will understand that this is
not the best manner in which to raise issues it believes exist.''
	   Greece and Turkey are divided by a wide range of disputes,
including territorial waters, air space, seabed mineral rights, the
size of the continental shelf and Cyprus.
	   Relations between the two deteriorated further in December, when
the European Union voted to accept Cyprus' application for entering
the 15-nation bloc while ruling Turkey was not yet ready to begin
entry negotiations.

Cambodian police investigate grenade attack at amusement park
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS newspaper reports of arrests, police denials in grafs
5-6; picks up 5th graf pvs: `A bystander...'

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Police on Tuesday were leaning away
from blaming politics as the motive of a grenade attack at a
children's amusement park that killed one person and injured six
others.
	   Khieu Sopheak, an Interior Ministry official, said that the
attack Monday night was still under investigation but appeared to
stem from a personal dispute.
	   The blast came during the tense run-up to parliamentary
elections July 26, but there was no obvious political target at the
site, near the luxury Cambodiana hotel.
	   The government called a news conference Tuesday promising ``to
show who is the mastermind,'' hinting members of the opposition
might be blamed for the explosion. Officials later canceled the
briefing without explanation.
	   At least two local newspapers _ the pro-government Koh
Santepheap and the independent Cambodge Soir _ reported Tuesday
that two people had been arrested in connection with the explosion.
	   But police and other officials denied there had been any
arrests.
	   A bystander said that minutes before the explosion, she saw an
intense argument between a man in a coffee-colored bodyguard
uniform _ who she thinks later threw the grenade as he was fleeing
_ and a man in civilian clothes, a human rights worker said.
	   But police said that they thought the lethal device was tossed
into the park from a passing motorbike.
	   The only confirmed fatality was Chan Pich Reasey, 19.
	   Cambodia is awash with weapons, a legacy of more than two
decades of civil war. Laws controlling unauthorized possession of
guns and grenades are rarely enforced.
	   More than 16 people were killed and 100 injured in March 1997
when four grenades were lobbed into a peaceful protest led by Sam
Rainsy, one of the leading opposition election candidates.
	   Sam Rainsy was slightly injured. The attack was widely blamed on
strongman Hun Sen.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ With trucks and cars, strikers
blaring horns blocked the main highway leading to San Juan's
international airport Tuesday, the first volley in what threatens
to be Puerto Rico's biggest strike in decades.
	   ``I'm with the strikers,'' Mildred Gonzalez, a driver caught in
the traffic jam, told a radio station by cellular telephone.
	   Union leaders expect up to half a million of Puerto Rico's 3.8
million people to join a 48-hour general strike starting Tuesday to
protest the sale of the state telephone company. Most are
government employees, including utility and health workers.
	   The blockade of hundreds of vehicles across the six-lane
Baldorioty de Castro cut off the main highway east of San Juan and
access from the city to Luis Munoz Marin International Airport and
a string of towns including Carolina, Loiza, Rio Grande and the
port of Fajardo.
	   American Airlines said it canceled one flight to Miami because
only 59 of an expected 138 passengers were able to get to the
airport.
	   Arriving passengers were able to leave the airport by another
exit.
	   Riot police who had set up barricades to protect the airport
were taken by surprise by the blockade, which began at dawn
Tuesday. A helicopter patrolled above.
	   One of the telephone unions said they would lift the blockade at
midday and move their protest to other areas.
	   In preparation for the strike, shopkeepers barred windows with
steel shutters, riot police guarded ports and power plants and
residents stocked up on water and batteries.
	   ``You'd think we were preparing for a hurricane,'' one shopper
said, her arms crammed with candles and water bottles.

Conference on ways to eliminate landmines opens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Military representatives of 33 countries
as well as non-governmental organizations opened a four-day
conference Tuesday aimed eliminating land mines throughout Europe.
	   The conference, organized by the Austrian defense ministry, the
Italian armed forces and the West European Union, is to improve
cooperation in mine detection and destruction.
	   ``The seminar is a sign of a new era in cooperation in the
fields of disarmament and humanitarian assistance,'' Austrian Gen.
Karl Majecen told the conference during opening ceremonies.
	   Austrian mine clearing experts are working with their
counterparts from other countries in detecting and destroying
landmines in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Golan Heights between Syria
and Israel.
	   The conference is expected to include discussions on ways to
compile information and databanks on non-standard landmines, making
them easier to disarm safely.
	   Majecen said it was time for European countries to coordinate
their activities and share information in landmine technology and
ways to detect and disarm them
	   During his speech, Italian Defense Minister Massimo Brutti
praised efforts by Europe and international organizations to remove
``these instruments of death.''
	   Brutti said Italy had already taken steps to comply with the
1997 Ottawa Treaty which bans the production, storage and use of
such weapons.
	   The United States refused to sign the treaty because it wants to
maintain landmines in the demilitarized zone separating North and
South Korea. The Pentagon also wants to exempt anti-personnel mines
designed to deter tampering with larger anti-tank mines not covered
by the treaty.
	   Washington is also lobbying NATO countries to allow the
stockpiling of anti-personnel mines until the year 2003. Critics
accuse the Americans of trying to undermine the treaty among their
European allies.

EU clears British Aerospace stake in Saab
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union regulators Tuesday
approved the acquisition by British Aerospace PLC of a 35 percent
stake in Swedish aircraft company Saab AB.
	   The European Commission said the operation will strengthen both
companies' positions in the European defense industry but not cause
serious competition concerns since they face strong competition
from European and American companies.
	   ``The operation is a further step towards the transnational
restructuring and consolidation of the European defense industry,''
the Commission said in a statement.
	   Overlap between Saab and British Aerospace on their respective
home markets is ``insignificant,'' the Commission added.
	   The new joint venture will operate in the markets for military
aerospace and guided weapons systems and components.

Israeli ambulances demand police escort to enter Arab areas
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's Supreme Court has ruled that the
country's only ambulance service does not have to enter Arab
neighborhoods that it considers dangerous without a police escort.
	   Ambulance workers ``are not obligated to endanger themselves in
order to save the lives of others,'' Justice Mishael Cheshin and
two other judges ruled Monday.
	   The court rejected a petition filed by the Association of
Physicians for Human Rights, which charged that delays caused by
the ambulances' refusal to enter certain neighborhoods of Jerusalem
without a police escort had caused several Palestinian deaths. In
some cases, the escort never arrived, the group said.
	   Ami Osnat, legal adviser for the Magen David Adom emergency
medical service, said the court had rejected the petition after
being convinced that the ambulance service did not discriminate
against Arabs. Osnat said Magen David Adom ambulances would not
enter areas deemed dangerous _ all of which are Arab neighborhoods
_ without a police escort to treat Jews living in those
neighborhoods either.
	   Osnat added that it was impossible to prove the human rights
group's claim that the delays while waiting for police escort had
caused the deaths.
	   Magen David Adom's list of dangerous neighborhoods includes the
Shufat Refugee Camp, the Beit Hanina, Ras Al Amud and Silwan
neighborhoods, and Jerusalem's Old City _ except for the Jewish
Quarter. Osnat said ambulance teams had been attacked in those
neighborhoods before.
	   The Israeli newspaper Haaretz said Cheshin said that the human
rights group had provided incorrect information to the court that
``borders on racism.''
	   The group had argued that ambulances should be required to wait
for escorts only in cases of specific and real danger, not as a
general policy.
	   As a result of the court case, police said they would make
providing police escorts to ambulances a top priority, and Magen
David Adom agreed to establish a 24-hour hotline to follow up on
any complaints. The human rights group then agreed to withdraw its
appeal.
	   ``We decided to take what we got because the judge said he won't
give us anything more,'' said Hadass Ziv, an official with the
group.

India tests anti-tank missile
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India tested a heat-seeking anti-tank
missile at an eastern range Tuesday, United News of India reported.
	   The news agency, quoting unnamed government sources, said two of
the missiles dubbed Nag, or ``cobra,'' were successfully fired at
the Chandipur-on-Sea test range near Balasore, about 1,200
kilometers (750 miles) east of New Delhi.
	   The Nag was first tested last year. It is part of an ambitious
military program that includes developing medium-range ballistic
missiles that could be fitted with nuclear warheads.
	   India conducted nuclear tests in May, prompting worldwide
condemnation. Pakistan conducted nuclear tests soon after.

India urges Pakistan to agree to nuclear weapons proposal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's prime minister urged Pakistan on
Tuesday to accept his offer of a ``no-first use'' pact on nuclear
weapons and promised to pursue the issue when he meets his
Pakistani counterpart this month.
	   Tensions between the rival neighbors have soared since they
exploded nuclear devices in May, provoking widespread international
condemnation and economic sanctions.
	   ``If Pakistan agrees to this pact, it will be one more step in
confidence building measures between the two countries,'' Press
Trust of India news agency quoted Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee as telling Parliament Tuesday.
	   Vajpayee said Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has referred
to a similar proposal in the past ``but he hasn't sent the proposal
to us.''
	   Vajpayee said he would also take up with Sharif what he called
Pakistan's arming and training of terrorists in India-controlled
Kashmir. Pakistan denies the charge.
	   Muslim rebels have been fighting a separatist war in
India-controlled Kashmir since 1989. India and Pakistan have fought
two wars over Kashmir since they won independence from Britain 50
years ago. India has two-thirds of the territory and Pakistan the
rest, while both claim all of Kashmir.
	   ``We don't want war .... Pakistan has to change its foreign
policy toward India,'' Vajpayee said.
	   Several opposition lawmakers criticized the Vajpayee
government's handling of the international fallout of its decision
to conduct five nuclear tests. The tests brought aid cutoffs by
Japan, Australia, the United States and other countries.
	   The government has sent emissaries to the United States, France,
Britain and elsewhere to explain its nuclear stance, particularly
its opposition to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The government
has called the treaty _ which supported by much of the rest of the
world _ discriminatory, saying it gives a technological edge to
world powers who already have nuclear arsenals.
	   Vajpayee told parliament his envoys ``effectively and
convincingly'' explained India's stance on the nuclear tests.
	   India and the United States are holding more discussions on the
nuclear issue Sunday in Frankfurt, Germany, and on July 20 in New
Delhi.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ There's a new star rising in space exploration _
Japan.
	   Over the past 40 years, Japan has built up one of the world's
leading space programs, and it has done it with low budgets, no
manned flights of its own and very little fanfare.
	   Little fanfare, that is, until two milestone missions this week.
	   Over the weekend, Japan launched a probe on its way to Mars. If
successful, the probe will make Japan country only the third _
after the United States and Russia _ to reach another planet.
	   And on Tuesday, two Japanese satellites docked by remote control
in outer space, a first according to Japan's space agency.
	   The rendezvous had a deliberately Japanese twist.
	   It was timed to coincide with Japan's ``Tanabata,'' or star
festival, which celebrates a mythical meeting between the princess
Orihime and her lover, Hikoboshi. According to legend, the two _
associated with the summer stars Altair and Vega _ are only allowed
to meet once a year, on the night of July 7.
	   For Japan's space planners, the link-up had a different
symbolism.
	   ``Space exploration started as competition between America and
the Soviet Union,'' said Mitsunori Miyasato, a spokesman for
Japan's National Space Development Agency. ``But that era is
over.''
	   Japan's space bureaucracy has worked hard to wean itself from
reliance on foreign technology, and engineers now take pride in
Japan's development of its own rockets and satellites.
	   ``Without the technology to do it yourself, you're always going
to rely on others,'' said NASDA's Miyasato.
	   Japan's space program began humbly as a handful of university
professors launching rockets the size of pencils in 1955.
	   By 1970, the newly created NASDA had put Japan's first satellite
in space _ the fourth nation to do so after the two superpowers and
France.
	   Progress has often been slow.
	   NASDA's effort to build a liquid fuel rocket to compete for
commercial satellite launches suffered numerous failures, including
an explosion in 1991 that killed an engineer.
	   The first H-2 rocket finally lifted off in 1994, two years late
and so far over budget that it will probably never be able to
compete with low-cost launch services offered by neighboring China.
	   Japan's efforts in space have also suffered from bureaucratic
haggling. Its space program is split between two agencies, each
building its own rockets.
	   And Japanese scientists have had to make do with shoestring
budgets; spending on civilian space projects this year totaled only
about one-tenth of NASA's dlrs 13.6 billion budget.
	   Still, the efforts are paying off.
	   Japan now leads the world in several space-related fields,
including research on planetary magnetic fields.
	   With the completion last year of the M-5, a three or four-stage
solid fuel rocket, Japan finally has a homemade launch vehicle
strong enough to put probes into deep space.
	   The rocket has paved the way for a flurry of new missions,
including one next year to the Moon and an robot lander in 2001
that will visit an asteroid and bring back rock samples.
	   Japan's next interplanetary mission will probably be a probe to
Mercury early in the next millennium.
	   By far the biggest chunk of Japan's space budget is going to the
International Space Station.
	   Japan is the only Asian nation joining in that project, a
multi-national effort to establish humankind's first permanent
presence in space by 2003, and it is looking for a chance to
showcase its technological expertise.
	   Japan's space agency is spending 310 billion yen (dlrs 2.2
billion) to build the Japan Experiment Module, an 11 meter by 4.4
meter (36 foot by 14 foot) laboratory where astronauts will conduct
scientific research while in space.
	   The space station's living quarters, power plant and
superstructure will be built by the United States and Russia, but
Japan's contribution rivals Europe, which will also supply a
laboratory module.
	   After that _ human space flight.
	   Though two Japanese astronauts have flown on U.S. space
shuttles, NASDA is to test fly a scaled-down model of its own space
shuttle in 2000. Japan hopes to launch the real thing a decade
later.

Israeli ministers: Agreement on West Bank withdrawal soon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 6 grafs to UPDATE with Albright quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By HILARY APPELMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Declaring it a ``moment of truth,'' Israeli
Cabinet ministers said Tuesday that they expected a long-awaited
agreement on a West Bank troop withdrawal in the coming days or
weeks.
	   Agriculture Minister Rafael Eitan, meanwhile, joined the call
for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to hold early elections.
Eitan opposes any West Bank withdrawal and has said he will
challenge Netanyahu in the next elections, scheduled for 2000.
	   ``It's better to go to the polls now, standing tall, and let the
nation decide, than to wait and squirm,'' he told The Associated
Press.
	   The United States is pushing Netanyahu to accept a U.S. plan for
an Israeli withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank, but several
months have passed without a response from the prime minister.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said on CNN on Monday
that she had spoken ``intensively'' by telephone with Netanyahu in
recent days and that ``We are coming closer'' to agreement.
	   ``But it is a very tough problem that requires a great deal of
patience,'' she added. ``We're all trying to be patient with it
while pushing forward to narrow the gaps.''
	   Arab leaders have warned that the lack of movement and growing
tensions could lead to violence.
	   Mohammed Dahlan, a Palestinian security chief in the autonomous
Gaza Strip, said Tuesday that the situation in the
Palestinian-controlled areas was ``ripe for an explosion.''
	   Israel's refusal to carry out the withdrawal ``will push the
Palestinians into a corner and encourage extremists,'' he said.
	   Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, speaking to reporters during
a visit to an army base near the West Bank town of Bethlehem, said
Tuesday that he expected a decision on an agreement in ``a few
days.''
	   ``This is the moment of truth,'' he said.
	   Mordechai added, however, that it would take more time to work
out details and implement any agreement.
	   Trade Minister Natan Sharansky, while denying reports that he
had given Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a Friday deadline for a
decision on an agreement, said ``We are very close to the end.''
	   ``We are very close to exhausting the possibilities in the
negotiations,'' he said. ``If we can sign an agreement, so much the
better, and if not we have to make public precisely where we stand,
what we have done, and who is to blame.''
	   Sharansky said there cannot be an agreement until Israel
receives ``satisfactory answers'' from the Palestinians on
fulfilling their commitments under past agreements. But he added,
``We cannot sit waiting for answers for eternity.''
	   Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani said the agreement
would ``stand or fall'' during the month of July.
	   ``If there is no agreement, the prime minister will have to tell
the people of Israel the reasons why.''
	   Initially, Netanyahu said he could not accept the U.S. plan
because the 13 percent figure was too high, but in recent weeks he
has insisted that the only obstacle to agreement was the
Palestinians' failure to make concrete commitments to carry out
their obligation to fight terrorism.

Senate enters final debate on bill to limit Aboriginal land rights
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with debate adjourned until Wednesday, grafs 7-8 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Aborigines and the opposition mounted
a last-ditch campaign Tuesday to kill a Senate bill to limit
Aboriginal land claims, saying it would wipe out their fishing
rights in coastal waters.
	   In a ruling that extended the concept of native title, a Federal
Court in Darwin ruled Monday that Aborigines from Croker Island off
northern Australia have communal rights over the sea and seabed.
	   Justice Howard Olney said Aborigines from five clans had limited
rights in relation to the sea and seabed in an area of about 1,000
square miles (2,600 square kilometers) north of the Coburg
Peninsula.
	   But the judge said the rights are not exclusive and that anglers
and commercial fishermen can use the waters.
	   The Croker Island claim is considered a test case for at least
120 claims to sea area over thousands of square miles (kilometers)
off Australia's coast, including prime fishing and resort areas.
	   The ruling came during the final stages of Senate debate on a
government-sponsored bill to limit Aboriginal claims on some 42
percent of Australia, which is leased by the government to
ranchers, farmers and miners.
	   The bill already has been debated for the longest time in the
Senate's 97-year history. A final vote was again delayed when the
Senate adjourned late Tuesday with only a few amendments left to be
debated.
	   Debate was to resume Wednesday morning.
	   One of the provisions of the government's bill is that
Aborigines should have no right to make claims on air space or
waters.
	   Aborigines, and the opposition Labor Party and Democrats, argued
Tuesday that passage of the bill would negate the gains made by the
Croker Island Aborigines in the courts.
	   ``That's one of the areas of extinguishment the Democrats are
very disappointed with,'' Democrat Sen. Meg Lees said Tuesday.
	   But the government says the finding has no implications for its
bill.
	   Special Minister of State Nick Minchin said the bill already
provided a mechanism for the recognition and protection of native
title offshore, with compensation payable for its impairment or
extinguishment.
	   The bill is back in the Senate for the third time after Prime
Minister John Howard struck a compromise deal with independent Sen.
Brian Harradine.
	   Howard had threatened months ago to dissolve Parliament and go
to a general election to resolve the issue after the Senate twice
defeated his bill.
	   But this month, as the third and final attempt to pass the bill
loomed, Howard regretted that pledge as his government's popularity
sank to 34 percent in the polls, the lowest since it was elected in
1996, far behind the Labor Party's popularity.
	   Harradine, who had voted against the bill twice before, won some
concessions to Aborigines in a new amended version and has pledged
to support the bill.
	   The government is one vote short of a majority in the Senate, so
Harradine's vote is essential to passing the bill.
	   In 1992, the Mabo case in the High Court established Aborigines'
common law right to claim native title to vacant government lands.
	   The case reversed a previous legal fiction called ``terra
nullius,'' which held that Australia was an empty land when the
first white settlers arrived in 1788.
	   In 1996, the High Court said in the Wik case that Aborigines
could have the right of access for religious and cultural
ceremonies to the vast lands that the government leases long term
to ranchers, farmers and miners.

Balkan contact group expected to call for Kosovo cease-fire
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS new 5th graf with Russian pressure &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Seeking to get peace talks started in Serbia's
rebellious Kosovo province, the six-nation Contact Group for the
Balkans is expected to back off demands for an immediate withdrawal
of Serb forces and call instead on both sides to agree to a
cease-fire.
	   Diplomats in Bonn, where the Contact Group meets on Wednesday,
and Washington have signaled the shift in recent days, amid
continued fighting in the province between Serb forces and ethnic
Albanian separatists.
	   Among demands the group made at its June 12 meeting in London
was that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic order his special
forces to return to their bases. He has refused to do so, citing
continued attacks by the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA).
	   While the Contact Group is not expected to drop its demand for
withdrawal, diplomats say there is increasing recognition that a
cease-fire is needed first. An internationally monitored truce
would ensure that the KLA does not seize the opportunity of a troop
withdrawal to rush in and gain more territory in Kosovo.
	   Russia, Serbia's traditional ally, also has been pressuring the
West to drop its demand for a Serb withdrawal in light of stepped
up KLA activity.
	   Also expected to be debated in Bonn are recent American contacts
with purported Kosovo Liberation Army leaders. Only a few months
ago, Washington had referred to the KLA as terrorists.
	   The Americans are now proposing a seat at the negotiating table
for the KLA alongside Ibrahim Rugova, the pacifist moderate who
many ethnic Albanians look to as their leader.
	   The Contact Group _ the United States, Russia, Britain, Germany,
France and Italy _ has an international mandate to monitor events
in former Yugoslavia.

World Cup: FIFA boss criticizes disciplinary committee for
</HEADLINE>
overlooking hard fouls &QL; 
 &UR; By LARRY SIDDONS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The boss of soccer had harsh words Tuesday for the
panel that hands out player suspensions at the World Cup, saying it
had rejected his suggestion that it use video replays to assess two
hard fouls.
	   FIFA president Sepp Blatter said he had pointed out to the
disciplinary committee that TV tapes would show blatant actions by
Dutch striker Dennis Bergkamp against a Yugoslav defender and by a
Moroccan player against Brazilian superstar Ronaldo.
	   In neither case was a foul called nor later suspensions handed
out by the disciplinary panel, even though Blatter said he thought
such action was justified.
	   ``Sure, I saw it,'' he said when asked if there was video proof
of a suspension-level action by Bergkamp against Sinisa Mihajlovic
in a first-round game.
	   Video replays showed Bergkamp stomping on Mihajlovic as he lay
on the ground. A similar foul drew a two-game suspension for
France's playmaker, Zihedine Zidane.
	   Blatter said he also had seen video tapes showing a blatant foul
by Said Chiba of Morocco, who planted his cleats in the left thigh
of Ronaldo and left deep scratches.
	   ``In two cases, the FIFA president has drawn the presence of
video evidence to their attention,'' Blatter said, referring to the
disciplinary panel. ``They said, `No, it's not needed.' That's OK.
When you have a clean separation of the different powers in a body,
that's their prerogative.''
	   But although he said he didn't order the cases to be reviewed,
Blatter left no doubt he was not happy and would not let the matter
die. He seemed to be particularly upset when it was pointed out
that the referee in the Bergkamp incident, Jose-Manuel Garcia of
Spain, had been picked to handle Wednesday night's France-Croatia
semifinal.
	   ``We'll take up this in assessing the World Cup,'' he said. ``I
will have a word with them _ a very serious word.''
	   Although soccer does not use replays to review on-field
decisions, FIFA does allow the use of tapes to decide the length of
suspensions. The most notable case was in 1994, when an eight-game
ban was imposed on Mauro Tassotti for an elbow to the face of
Spain's Luis Enrique during the quarterfinals, a foul that was
missed by the referee.
	   In 75-minute meeting with reporters, Blatter also said:
	   _A crackdown on tackles from behind had worked to make the game
safer and spotlight an aggressive offense. Although it had led to a
flood of ejections and warnings, Blatter said, the rules were being
applied evenly and accurately. ``The referees have been logical and
at their best,'' he said.
	   Blatter also said that, while dangerous tackling was down,
players had resorted to wrestling-like holds and ``textile
testing'' by pulling shirts of their opponents to drag them out of
position. He said those offenses would be the next targets of
referees.
	   _The World Cup might be too long and could be shortened by a
week in its next edition in 2002. Blatter said the field would
remain at 32 teams, where it was raised this year, but organizers
might shorten gaps between first-round games from six to four days
and play more games per day. He said a decision would be reached
this fall.
	   _Authorities had done all they could to avoid hooliganism and
acted quickly and responsibly when fan violence erupted in
Marseille and Lens early in the tournament. ``We were prepared. The
police in Europe were prepared,'' he said. ``But it is not possible
to avoid violence anywhere at any time.'' Blatter renewed his call
for better coordination among European Union nations to prevent
known troublemakers from crossing their borders.
	   _The first steps in his proposed restructuring of FIFA
management into a larger service team would begin with the first
meeting of the new executive board Thursday. But Blatter said the
issue of what he would be paid as he changes the presidency from
part-time to full-time would not come up. ``If I am working 100
percent of my time for FIFA, it somehow will compensate me,'' he
said. ``But I will not put it on the agenda. That would be a
disgrace to the organization.''

Anti-racism group demands Croatia change soccer shirt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ An anti-racism group demanded Tuesday that
Croatia's World Cup soccer team change its shirt, saying the colors
evoke the country's pro-Nazi regime during World War II.
	   Croatia, in its first-ever World Cup and playing host nation
France in a semifinal on Wednesday, uses shirts with a
red-and-white checkerboard design.
	   The colors ``gravely undermine the duty of remembering and
endanger (Croatia's) young democracy,'' said a statement by the
European Center of Research and Action on Racism and Anti-Semitism.
	   Chantal Boublil, the spokeswoman, said the center planned to
lodge a complaint with FIFA, soccer's world governing body.
	   She said Croatia's semifinal on Wednesday in Stade de France was
the perfect opportunity to press their case.
	   ``We want the team to change its shirt. We must try,'' she said.
``This is an ideal time to raise world awareness.''
	   Darko Tironi, spokesman for the Croatian team, dismissed the
statement as ``a silly complaint.''
	   ``Croatia has used these colors since the 7th century,'' he
said. ``We won't put an end to 1,300 years of history just because
we're in the semifinal.''
	   Croatia's Nazi-backed regime killed tens of thousands of Jews,
Serbs, Gypsies and others it considered enemies.

Government identifies diplomat accused of spying for South Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Foreign Ministry released the name of a
senior diplomat Tuesday who is accused of turning over classified
information to South Korea.
	   The South Korean diplomat, identified as Cho Sung-woo, was
detained by counterintelligence agents last Friday as he met with
an alleged Russian contact. He was declared persona non grata and
ordered to leave Russia.
	   On Tuesday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin
identified Cho's Russian contact as Valentin Moiseyev, a deputy
chief of the ministry's First Asian Department, which deals with
both Koreas as well as China and Mongolia.
	   The Second and Third Asian departments deal with other Asian
nations.
	   Before his appointment, Moiseyev worked in North Korea as a
Russian newspaper correspondent and then a trade mission employee,
Rakhmanin said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   ``We would like Seoul to comprehend the seriousness of the
incident and not to regard it as a pretext for fanning passions,
particularly through a prism of any possible retaliation,'' the
Russian spokesman said.
	   Moiseyev has remained in jail since his arrest.

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Indian openers Sachin Tendulkar and
Saurav Ganguly cracked centuries to establish a record first wicket
partnership as their side made an imposing 307 for 6 in the final
of the 3-nation Independence Cup tournament against Sri Lanka at
the Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on Tuesday.
	   Tendulkar smashed 128 in 131 balls while Ganguly stroked 109 as
the pair put on 252 runs to surpass a previous best 225 by Kenya's
Kennedy Otieno and Dipak Chudasaman against Bangladesh at Nairobi,
Kenya in 1997-98.
	   Tendulkar blasted his first 50 in only 39 balls with six fours
and one six but reached the balance 50 runs with just a single
boundary added as he led the way in consolidating India's position
after his skipper Mohammed Azharuddin won the toss and decided to
bat.
	   Tendulkar in all hit eight fours and two sixes before the video
umpire ruled him stumped off a ball from Sanath Jayasuriya in the
44th over.
	   Tendulkar in the process equaled a world record of 17 centuries
in one-day internationals set by West Indies batsman Desmond
Haynes.
	   Ganguly fell in the next over giving Muttiah Muralitheran a
return catch after hitting six fours and two sixes.
	   Ganguly, however, survived an anxious moment when wicketkeeper
Romesh Kaluwitharana's leg-side appeal for a catch off Kumara
Dharmasena was turned down with his score on 98 and the total on
233.
	   The exits of Tendulkar and Ganguly did not bring an end to Sri
Lanka's woes as Robin Singh (15) and Ajay Jadeja (25) wrecked
further havoc on the home side.
	   Jadeja made his runs in only 25 balls while hitting Dharmasena
for two successive sixes over long-on.

Officials hold talks as airport problems continue

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with comments from airport authority chief,
details &QL; 
 &UR; By PRISCILLA CHEUNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Fending off criticism that they were
unprepared, managers of Hong Kong's huge new airport said Tuesday
they were solving a string of problems that left passengers waiting
for bags, stuck on planes or wondering where flights were.
	   A major air cargo handler moved some operations back to the old
airport because of the problems nagging Chek Lap Kok airport on its
second day of operation. Passengers, too, were frustrated.
	   Two senior government officials held urgent talks with Airport
Authority managers as complaints piled up.
	   Airport Authority chief Hank Townsend defended the dlrs 20
billion airport from criticism that it was opened before it was
ready.
	   ``No matter how much longer we waited, you still would have the
same kind of problems,'' Townsend told reporters. ``We feel this is
mostly under control, and we don't expect to see it coming up
continuously.''
	   He said the situation had improved over the first day of
operation.
	   Since the airport opened Monday morning, passengers have
experienced delays in baggage handling and flight information. Some
complained that they had to wait an hour or more to get off the
their planes after they arrived, and many said that the vast
airport's signs were poor.
	   Spokesman Chris Donnolly said passengers Tuesday had to wait for
20-30 minutes for their bags, which he termed ``not desirable, but
not unacceptable.''
	   The new airport, built on reclaimed land on a remote outlying
island, replaced venerable Kai Tak, famous for its roof-skimming
approaches over congested urban areas.
	   About 80,000 passengers and 220 flights used the airport Monday.
Another 100,000 residents visited the airport, Donnolly said.
	   Airport officials said that as of 5:30 p.m. (0930 GMT), more
than 290 flights had either arrived or left the airport Tuesday. Of
146 departures, 80 left within 15 minutes of schedule.
	   Chief Secretary Anson Chan, Hong Kong's top civil servant, and
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang met with Airport Authority
officials to sort out the problems.
	   ``What we want to do is prevent small problems from building up
into big problems,'' Chan said. She added that safety was not at
risk.
	   The airport authority said in a statement that it expected to
clear a backlog of 2,000 bags during the night, and that it was
ensuring flight information was displayed in a timely manner,
fixing problems with air bridges, and improving the signs.
	   ``It's just not possible to have a trial operation with that
many aircraft, with that many passengers, with that much cargo,''
Townsend said.
	   The efforts didn't immediately reduce the frustration of
passengers and cargo handlers.
	   Anthony Charter, managing director of Hong Kong Air Cargo
Terminals, told Hong Kong radio that the reception of some freight
exports and release of some imports would be moved back to the
company's old facilities at Kai Tak airport because of computer
problems at the new airport.
	   Wendy Au, a 16-year-old student who arrived Tuesday on a
Canadian Air flight from Vancouver, found the new airport chaotic.
``I'm very frustrated,'' she said.
	   Au said it took her about 90 minutes from the time the plane
landed to get off the plane, clear immigration and customs and
retrieve her luggage. She said she saw no signs for getting into
the general arrival hall.
	   Hong Kong newspapers gave the airport opening mixed reviews.
	   The Apple Daily urged understanding, saying, ``Even when we move
house, we encounter many trivial problems that cause inconvenience,
let alone such a massive operation as moving the airport.''
	   However, the Oriental Daily News was less forgiving. It said the
problems showed that the airport wasn't ready for operation.
``People's safety is at stake,'' it said. ``The transition between
the old and new airport should have been perfect.''

Miners protest spreads to north, government refuses to negotiate
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES grafs 1-7 with standoff between government and miners
continuing. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government will not negotiate with coal miners
who are blocking the Trans-Siberian railway until they lift their
blockade, a high-ranking official said Tuesday.
	   The miners responded by saying they will keep the railway shut
down until Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Sysuyev meets with them
personally to redress their demands.
	   As the miners blocked traffic on the Trans-Siberian for a fifth
day, miners in the far north joined the protests and halted trains
on another rail line, Russian news agencies reported.
	   Several hundred miners in the central Siberian mining town of
Anzhero-Sudzhensk began the protest Friday over government plans to
close mines and reduce subsidies to local coal-related industries.
	   They said they will lift the blockade, at least temporarily, if
Sysuyev agrees to meet with them in Anzhero-Sudzhensk to review a
settlement that ended a similar blockade in May.
	   The miners claim the government is not paying the back wages it
promised in the agreement.
	   But Sysuyev said there can be no talks until the picket lines
are removed from the railway, the Interfax news agency said. The
strikers regard Sysuyev's reply as an ultimatum, and decided to
``stand to the end,'' a strike committee spokesman told Interfax.
	   Trains are now stranded in several places along the
Trans-Siberian, with industry in the Tomsk region grinding to a
halt because the area's one link to the railway has been blocked,
the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Meanwhile, miners in the northern region of Komi have similar
complaints and began blocking a rail line on Tuesday, news reports
said.
	   The latest protests have resulted in an estimated 7 million
rubles (dlrs 1.2 million) in losses, Oleg Moshenko, the deputy
railway minister, was quoted as saying by ITAR-Tass.
	   The Russian Independent Miners Union estimated that nearly
60,000 miners have taken part in protests across Russia since the
start of the year, Interfax reported.
	   Russia has been gradually shutting down loss-making coal mines.
But some mines are the lone source of employment in isolated
regions, and unpaid miners have difficulty finding new work.

Dutch carrier to repurchase common shares from government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS that repurchase is subject to shareholder approval,
government now holds 25 percent of shares. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ KLM Royal Dutch Airlines said
Tuesday it will buy back 8.47 million common shares from the Dutch
government, cutting the state's voting stake in the national
carrier from 25 percent to 14 percent.
	   Under the move, the airline also will purchase 4.84 million
participation certificates from the KLM Flight Personnel Pension
Fund Foundation.
	   KLM did not detail terms of the repurchase, which is subject to
the approval of priority shareholders and the board of the pension
fund.
	   The Amsterdam-based carrier said that following the transaction,
which it expects to be completed Aug. 14, the number of common
shares will be reduced by 18 percent to 60.7 million common
outstanding shares. There are now 68.8 million outstanding shares.
	   Under the buyback, the government's stake in KLM will drop to
11.8 million preference shares and 1,300 priority shares.
	   The price KLM will pay for the government-held shares will be
determined by the trading value of the shares on the stock exchange
on Aug. 6, 7, 10 and 11, KLM said in a statement.
	   KLM shares surged Tuesday on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange on
news of the buyback. As of noon GMT, shares were trading up 7.3
percent at 91.70 guilders (dlrs 44.82).
	   In May, KLM posted a net profit for fiscal 1998 of 2.2 billion
guilders (dlrs 1.1 billion), up from 236 million guilders (dlrs 118
million) in the previous year.
	   KLM said the buyback pact will boost earnings per share in the
current fiscal year by 15 percent. Analysts said they will be
upping their earnings estimates accordingly, but noted that the
deal could be scrapped if KLM's share price moves sharply.

At least 12 policemen, 12 Tamil rebels killed in guerrilla attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EDITORS' NOTE: This story was censored by the Sri Lankan
military.
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Tamil Tiger guerrillas attacked a
police patrol in eastern Sri Lanka Tuesday and at least 24 people
were killed on both sides, police officials said.
	   Twelve policemen were killed in the midmorning attack at
Pulukunawa village in the Ampara district, before police beat off
the attack, said officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Officials estimated at least a dozen guerrillas were also
killed.
	   Fourteen policemen were wounded in the clash 220 kilometers (135
miles) east of the capital, Colombo.
	   The defense ministry did not immediately comment.
	   The guerrillas have been fighting since 1983 for a separate
homeland for the nation's minority Tamils, who make up 18 percent
of the 18 million population. They allege they are discriminated
against by the majority Sinhalese, who dominate the government and
military.

bill &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with key amendments passed, final vote
expected to be formality &QL;

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The upper house of Australia's
Parliament agreed Tuesday to the major parts of the government's
plan to restrict Aborigines' land claims.
	   The Senate ran out of time, however, and a final vote was due
Wednesday on the government's bill, which has been at the center of
an often bitter and divisive debate about Aborigines' rights.
	   On most key points in Tuesday's debate, the Senate agreed to
pass the government's plan to overhaul the existing law enshrining
Aboriginal land rights, the Native Title Act, and the final vote is
now expected to be a formality.
	   The Labor opposition and other minor parties in the closely
divided Senate condemned the legislation during the debate, saying
it unfairly and severely restricts Aborigines' rights.
	   The government maintained its bill was a workable solution that
provides certainty to farmers, ranchers and miners and is fair to
Aborigines.
	   The deciding vote was assured by talks last week between Prime
Minister John Howard and key independent Sen. Brian Harradine, who,
fearing Howard would call an election that would be fought on race
issues, renegotiated his objections to the government's bill.
	   In a protest read to the Senate at the end of Tuesday's debate,
Aboriginal leaders said they ``entirely reject'' the government's
plan.
	   ``Our ownership derives from ancient title, which precedes the
colonization of this continent, and our ownership must continue to
be recognized in accordance with our indigenous affiliation with
the land, waters and environment,'' they said.
	   Opponents of the bill say the six years of debate and often
bitter wrangling over native title is unlikely to end after the
bill is passed because Aborigines will challenge it in the courts.
	   The debate started in 1992 when the country's most powerful
judicial body, the High Court, ruled that native title rights still
exist in Australia in certain limited circumstances.
	   This ruling reversing a previous legal fiction of ``terra
nullius,'' which held that Australia was an empty land when the
first white settlers arrived in 1788.
	   In its ruling on the Wik case in 1996, the High Court
established that Aborigines could have limited access to the vast
lands that the government leases long term to ranchers and farmers,
which cover some 42 percent of Australia.
	   After being elected in 1996, Howard and his government said the
native title laws were unworkable and introduced comprehensive
amendments.
	   He said his 10-point plan would give ranchers certainty over
their leased land. Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer said the bill
contained ``bucketloads of extinguishment'' of native title.
	   The bill was twice blocked in the Senate, pushing Howard to the
brink of calling an early election to solve the impasse.
	   With his government trailing badly in opinion polls, Howard
returned to talks with Harradine.
	   The bill includes a strengthening of the registration tests for
claimants, validates government actions that have extinguished
potential native title and alters claimants' rights to negotiate on
development.
	   But the Labor opposition, lawyers for Aboriginal groups and
others say the legislation does not deliver certainty because the
High Court may yet hear a claim that it is unconstitutional because
it discriminates against Aborigines.

 &UR; Yugoslav soldiers enter Albanian territory

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ A group of 20 Yugoslav soldiers crossed
the border into neighboring Albania and took up fighting positions
for an hour, the Albanian interior ministry said Tuesday.
	   The incident occured Sunday afternoon, when the troops crossed
80 meters (yards) into Albanian territory in the Has region, the
ministry said. After about an hour, the soldiers returned to
Yugoslavia without incident.
	   There was no official comment from Yugoslavia.
	   The reported incursion occured just one day after five Muslim
soldiers deserted the Yugoslav army, saying they refused to kill
women and children and crossed into Albanian in the same region.
	   Militant ethnic Albanians fighting for independence for Kosovo
province from the southern Yugoslav republic of Serbia have been
regrouping and arming themselves inside the Albanian border for
months.
	   Last month, Yugoslav soldiers firing across the border killed an
Albanian man and two mules in an apparent effort to stop pack
trains carrying weapons across the border into Kosovo.

Opposition MP files third appeal against sedition charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ An opposition member of Parliament
sentenced to prison on sedition charges filed an appeal Tuesday
calling his sentence ``manifestly excessive,'' a news report said.
	   Lim Guan Eng, deputy secretary-general of the Democratic Action
Party and a member of Parliament for 12 years, was sentenced in
April by the Court of Appeal to two 18-month prison terms to be
served concurrently. It set aside two fines of 10,000 ringgit (dlrs
2,500) and 5,000 ringgit (dlrs 1,250) imposed by the High Court
last year, finding those penalties too light.
	   Lim was convicted last April for publishing a pamphlet in 1995
that questioned the government's decision not to press statutory
rape charges against Abdul Rahim Tamby Chik, former chief minister
of Malacca state. He also questioned why the schoolgirl was
detained after the sex scandal broke, but not the minister.
	   In Federal Court Tuesday, Lim filed his third petition, which
contained 30 grounds for appeal, with his attorney, Karpal Singh,
and a group of some 20 supporters.
	   The appeal argues that the prison sentences were a ``manifestly
excessive'' punishment and that the Court of Appeal was wrong to
replace fines with prison terms.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police battling ethnic
Albanians in a village near one of Kosovo's largest cities have
forced them to retreat, Serb sources reported Tuesday.
	   The pro-government Serb Media Center said the Kosovo Liberation
Army retreated from Lodja village overnight in the region near the
southwestern city of Pec. With phone lines cut and the main road
leading into the region sealed off by Serb police for security
reasons, there were few details on the situation Tuesday, but no
new fighting was reported.
	   The fighting flared Monday, with the ethnic-Albanian-run Kosovo
Information Center reporting one person killed and three wounded by
heavy shelling of Lodja village, near Pec.
	   Serb sources said armed Albanians opened fire on Serb villagers,
forcing a Serb counter-attack.
	   The Serb Media Center reported two policemen killed and six
others wounded in the fighting at Lodja. The Media Center said that
11 civilians and two policemen were evacuated overnight from Lodja,
and large quantities of weapons were collected after fleeing KLA
forces left them behind.

Employees protest planned job cuts at defense firm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ About 500 employees of the state-run armaments
company Giat Industries demonstrated for three hours Tuesday to
protest a proposal to cut more than 3,000 jobs.
	   The demonstration at Giat headquarters in Versailles-Satory,
west of Paris, coincided with a board meeting in which the
proposal, part of a four-year ``strategic, economic and social
plan,'' was being presented.
	   Andre Golliard, union representative of the French Labor
Confederation, said Giat officials, whom he did not identify,
``listened to our demands'' but refused to comment. They then
returned to the board meeting which ended 20 minutes later.
	   Golliard called the demonstration a ``first warning free of
charge.''
	   Giat, which employs 10,300 people at sites around France, wants
to cut 3,274 jobs through early retirement starting at age 52 and
other means.
	   Two sites, at Salbris, in the Loire et Cher region, with 160
employees, and in Mans, in the Sarthe region, with 130 employees,
would be closed.

Rights group protests Kenyan's appointment to UN team to Algeria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The Kenya Human Rights Commission on
Tuesday protested the appointment of Attorney General Amos Wako to
a United Nations team investigating violence in Algeria.
	   In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the private
organization said Wako was unfit for the mission because he has
``failed to investigate and deal with violence within Kenya itself.
''
	   ``Since the political violence erupted, there has been no
prosecution of the people incriminated in that violence,'' the
commission said.
	   More than 1,500 people have died in sporadic and politically
motivated ethnic violence that erupted in late 1991. Hundreds of
thousands of people were forced to flee their homes and small
farms.
	   Wako, who is Kenya's public prosecutor, could not be reached for
comment. He served on a similar U.N. mission to the former
Portuguese territory of East Timor, which was forcibly occupied and
annexed by Indonesia in 1975.
	   The commission said it was willing to recommend ``many other
eminent Kenyans who could serve in this role.''
	   Other members of the team are from Portugal, France, India,
Jordan and the United States.
	   Since 1992 when the government annulled parliamentary elections
Muslim parties appeared poised to win, an estimated 75,000 people
have died in Algeria, victims of violent acts linked both to Muslim
fundamentalists and to the state security forces.

Police say Angola's former rebels kill 16 in ambush
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Gunmen from the former rebel movement
UNITA ambushed and killed 16 policemen in the remote northeast of
the country, officials said Tuesday.
	   A police vehicle traveling in Lunda Norte province near
Camaxilo, 500 kilometers (310 miles) northeast of Luanda, on Monday
hit three freshly-laid anti-tank mines and was immobilized,
according to the province's deputy police chief, Vitor Inaculo.
	   The assailants then sprayed the vehicle with machine-gun fire,
killing those who had survived the blasts, Inaculo told reporters.
	   UNITA troops later bombarded Camaxilo with artillery fire, he
said.
	   There was no independent verification of the incident.
	   The government has in recent months accused UNITA of keeping
armed men hidden in rural areas of this vast southwest African
country in contravention of the peace pact which ended a two-decade
civil war.
	   The government claims that remnants of UNITA's 70,000-strong
guerilla army are responsible for a string of attacks on remote
villages.
	   Inaculo claimed that there were large-scale UNITA troop
movements in Lunda Norte.
	   A diamond-rich province, Lunda Norte was last year a flashpoint
for renewed clashes between UNITA and government troops which
threatened to undermine the delayed implementation of the United
Nations-brokered peace deal.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the Nationals Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ maintains mining operations in the
region, earning it millions of dollars each year.
	   The U.N. Security Council last week imposed new sanctions on
UNITA, including a ban on its diamond sales, to force it to comply
fully with the peace agreement.

Israeli ministers: Agreement on West Bank withdrawal soon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Netanyahu saying agreement
expected soon, settlers stopping convoy in Gaza, edits to conform &QL; 
 &UR; By HILARY APPELMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told members
of his governing coalition Tuesday that he expects agreement on a
long overdue West Bank troop withdrawal soon, and Cabinet ministers
said they expected a deal within days or weeks.
	   ``This is the moment of truth,'' said Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai. ``I'm talking in terms of a few days.''
	   However even a top adviser to the prime minister, David
Bar-Illan, noted that there have been similar predictions in the
past. Bar-Illan said Netanyahu still hoped to achieve a deal before
the Knesset session ends Aug. 2, and that discussions were underway
``all the time'' with the U.S. administration.
	   ``It does look a little better now than it did a few days ago,''
he said.
	   The United States is pushing Netanyahu to accept a U.S. plan for
an Israeli withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank, but several
months have passed without a response from the prime minister.
	   Agriculture Minister Rafael Eitan, meanwhile, joined the call
for Netanyahu to hold early elections. Eitan opposes any West Bank
withdrawal and has said he will challenge the prime minister in t
he next elections, scheduled for 2000.
	   ``It's better to go to the polls now, standing tall, and let the
nation decide, than to wait and squirm,'' he told The Associated
Press.
	   In the Gaza Strip, Israeli settlers blocked a motorcade of
foreign diplomats and Palestinian officials for more than an hour
Tuesday on a disputed coast road.
	   The convoy was arranged by the Palestinian Information Ministry
to explain a showdown that took place on the road last week, when
Israeli and Palestinian troops confronted each other with cocked
assault rifles and armored personnel carriers. The confrontation
began after Israeli soldiers blocked a convoy headed by a
Palestinian minister from using the road.
	   Most of Gaza is under Palestinian self-rule, but Israel
maintains control of key roads leading to Jewish settlements there.
Palestinian officials have accused Israel of violating the
Israel-Palestinian accords, which stipulate that ``Palestinians
will be free to move along the coast road.''
	   Netanyahu accused the Palestinians of staging a deliberate
provocation and said the road would remain closed to Palestinians.
	   Arab leaders have warned that the lack of movement and growing
tensions could lead to bloodshed.
	   Mohammed Dahlan, a Palestinian security chief in Gaza, said
Tuesday that the situation in the Palestinian-controlled areas was
``ripe for an explosion.''
	   Israel's refusal to carry out the withdrawal ``will push the
Palestinians into a corner and encourage extremists,'' he said.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said on CNN on Monday
that she had spoken ``intensively'' by telephone with Netanyahu in
recent days and that ``We are coming closer'' to agreement.
	   ``But it is a very tough problem that requires a great deal of
patience,'' she added. ``We're all trying to be patient with it
while pushing forward to narrow the gaps.''
	   Trade Minister Natan Sharansky, while denying reports that he
had given Netanyahu a Friday deadline for a decision on an
agreement, said ``We are very close to the end.''
	   ``We are very close to exhausting the possibilities in the
negotiations,'' he said. ``If we can sign an agreement, so much the
better, and if not we have to make public precisely where we stand,
what we have done, and who is to blame.''
	   Sharansky said there cannot be an agreement until Israel
receives ``satisfactory answers'' from the Palestinians on
fulfilling their commitments under past agreements. But he added,
``We cannot sit waiting for answers for eternity.''
	   Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani said the agreement
would ``stand or fall'' during the month of July.
	   ``If there is no agreement, the prime minister will have to tell
the people of Israel the reasons why.''
	   Initially, Netanyahu said he could not accept the U.S. plan
because the 13 percent figure was too high, but in recent weeks he
has insisted that the only obstacle to agreement was the
Palestinians' failure to make concrete commitments to carry out
their obligation to fight terrorism.

Prince Charles, Harry visit backstage after 'Dr. Dolittle'
</HEADLINE>
premiere &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prince Charles nearly butted heads with a
two-headed, motorized llama at the royal premiere performance of
``Dr. Dolittle,'' prompting uncontrolled giggles from his son,
Prince Harry.
	   After the Monday night performance of the multimillion-pound
(dollar) musical at London's Apollo Theater, both princes met
Dolittle's furry friends backstage.
	   Phillip Schofield stars as the physician who has the unusual
ability to talk to animals. He is joined by more than 90 motorized
animals, including the llama, a snail, a horse, a seal and a parrot
_ whose voice is recorded by ``Sound of Music'' star Julie Andrews.
	   The two princes met the entire cast and crew on stage after the
show, based on the 1967 movie starring Rex Harrison and Anthony
Newley.
	   ``I thought it was great fun,'' said Harry, 13, who sat with his
father next to Ms. Andrews during the performance.
	   Afterwards, Charles asked 9-year-old Samuel Carter-Bown, who
appears in the show, how he managed to work in his studies. When
the boy replied that he fitted in his classes in the mornings,
Charles turned to Harry and said wryly: ``I don't know how you
would manage.''
	   The show officially opens July 14.

Dutch carrier to repurchase common shares from government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ KLM Royal Dutch Airlines said
Tuesday it will buy back 8.47 million common shares from the Dutch
government, cutting the state's voting stake in the national
carrier from 25 percent to 14 percent.
	   Under the move, the airline also will purchase 4.84 million
participation certificates from the KLM Flight Personnel Pension
Fund Foundation.
	   KLM did not detail terms of the repurchase, which is subject to
the approval of priority shareholders and the board of the pension
fund.
	   The Amsterdam-based carrier said that following the transaction,
which it expects to be completed Aug. 14, the number of common
shares will be reduced by 18 percent to 60.7 million common
outstanding shares. There are now 68.8 million outstanding shares.
	   Under the buyback, the government's stake in KLM will drop to
11.8 million preference shares and 1,300 priority shares.
	   The price KLM will pay for the government-held shares will be
determined by the trading value of the shares on the stock exchange
on Aug. 6, 7, 10 and 11, KLM said in a statement.
	   KLM shares surged Tuesday on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange on
news of the buyback. As of noon GMT, shares were trading up 7.3
percent at 91.70 guilders (dlrs 44.82).
	   In May, KLM posted a net profit for fiscal 1998 of 2.2 billion
guilders (dlrs 1.1 billion), up from 236 million guilders (dlrs 118
million) in the previous year.
	   KLM said the buyback pact will boost earnings per share in the
current fiscal year by 15 percent. Analysts said they will be
upping their earnings estimates accordingly, but noted that the
deal could be scrapped if KLM's share price moves sharply.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The Kuwait-U.S. joint petrochemical venture EQUATE
has produced 270,000 tons of polyethylene and ethylene glycol since
its inauguration in November, a company official said in remarks
published Tuesday.
	   EQUATE's vice president for marketing, Hamad al-Tarkeet, told
Al-Qabas daily that the company was looking to increase production
``in the near future.'' He did not elaborate.
	   Al-Tarkeet said most of the company's production was exported to
Asian markets, followed by European and Middle Eastern countries.
	   The dlrs 2 billion petrochemical plant is Kuwait's first oil
sector joint venture with a foreign partner. The state-owned
Petrochemical Industries Co. and U.S. chemical giant Union Carbide
hold 45 percent of the company. The remaining 10 percent is owned
by the public through Boubyan Petrochemical Co.
	   Polyethylene and ethylene glycol are used in manufacturing
plastic bags, toys, utensils, hoses, fabrics and video cassettes.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The state-run Council for Development and
Reconstruction has signed contracts worth more than dlrs 1 billion
to rebuild the electricity network that was devastated during the
1975-90 civil war, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   The council signed contracts worth dlrs 1.281 billion to
implement 47 electricity projects from 1992 to 1997, the daily
An-Nahar said, quoting a statement released by the council.
	   Of these, 28 projects costing dlrs 372.2 million, have been
completed, and 19 projects are being carried out at a cost of dlrs
908.8 million, the statement said.
	   The council, a government agency that oversees postwar projects,
added that dlrs 74.5 million are needed for other electricity
projects.
	   The Lebanese government has launched a multibillion dollar plan
to rebuild infrastructure that was damaged during the war. It has
been borrowing heavily to finance reconstruction projects.

	   MBABANE, Swaziland (AP) _ A utility company has cut off water
supplies to a royal village because the accounts haven't been paid.
	   The amount owed has been accumulating because both the
government and the Swazi king's office deny they are responsible
for settling royal water bills.
	   Scores of royal wives of the late King Sobhuza and their
grandchildren living in the royal village at Masunduwini near
Manzini were now relying on water brought from a river by army
trucks, the South African Press Association reported.
	   The Swaziland Water Services Corporation said it was owed 1.2

	   Government officials have warned that the lack of water for

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Annual inflation, which topped 75 percent
four years ago, has fallen to just 6.2 percent, a government report
said Tuesday.
	   Inflation in May fell 3 percent below April's level, the Federal
Office of Statistics said.
	   ``The government has done well by substantially bringing down
the inflation level, but it needs to be said that the purchasing
power of consumers is still very low,'' the report said.
	   Leading industry chiefs in Nigeria say the economy has not been
well managed in the last four years in the face of rising political
tensions.
	   Manufacturing and construction sectors _ the leading employers _
have remained stagnant in recent years with many down-sizing, the
Federal Office of Statistics report said.

	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ Unidentified assailants petrol
bombed the home of a local journalist working for the British
Broadcasting Corp. in northern Tanzania, a police official said.
	   The Paris-based rights organization Reporters Without Borders
sent a letter Tuesday to the Tanzanian minister of Information
demanding an investigation into the June 30 attack believed linked
to tensions between police and reporters in the Moshi region.
	   According to the statement, the burning of the journalist's home
followed a series of police interrogations of journalists in Moshi.
	   Nechi Lyimo, whose house was burned, was questioned by police
for three hours on June 12, the letter said.
	   Before the attack, the local journalists association in Moshi
had written a statement to the police demanding an end to
harassment.
	   ------
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A three-man panel wound up
investigations Tuesday into allegations that more than 40 people
needlessly died in Chris Hani Baragwanath hospital because of lack
of supervision during surgery by inexperienced doctors.
	   Provincial health authorities will decide on whether to convene
a commission of inquiry only after studying the panel's report,
spokesman Popo Maja said.
	   Allegations of needless deaths since 1996 were made by a former
superintendent at the main hospital in the black township of
Soweto, Dr. Bokkie Rabinowitz.
	   The Hospital Personnel Trade Union of South Africa on Tuesday
accused the Gauteng province health department of delaying the
probe into irregular deaths cited by Rabinowitz.
	   The opposition Democratic Party also demanded the appointment of
an independent medical ombudsman to deal with medical malpractice
in the province.
	   It said of 77 malpractice suits brought against the Gauteng
health department in the last four years, only 11 had been settled
and compensation averaged 10 percent of what had been claimed.
	   ------
	   SAO TOME, Sao Tome and Principe (AP) _ Parliament on Tuesday
approved a bill creating a joint-venture company between the
government and a U.S. firm to search for oil in offshore waters.
	   The company, named STPETRO, is to begin drilling in the fall.
The government has said it could take up to three years before the
economy begins to benefit.
	   The U.S. company, Environmental Remediation Holding Corp.,
started offshore oil exploration in July 1997 and said it had found
oil in the country's territorial waters. No estimates of reserves
were given.
	   Oil exports could provide a major boost to this impoverished
country's economy, which largely relies on the export of tropical
produce, mainly cocoa.
	   Sao Tome and Principe, a group of five volcanic islands about
150 miles (240 kilometers) west of Gabon, has a population of about
100,000.

	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ A South African mining corporation will
spend dlrs 20 million prospecting for copper and cobalt deposits in
central Zambia.
	   Avmin Mining Corporation spokesman Julian Gwillim the
exploration program north of the state-owned Konkola mine in the
Copperbelt province will take four years.
	   Avmin was a member of the Kafue Consortium negotiating to buy
Nchanga and Nkana, the largest state copper mines, but pulled out
after negotiations broke down over the price.
	   Gwillim said Avmin would not rejoin the negotiations but
intended to diversify its investments in other mining projects in
Zambia.

	   UMTATA, South Africa (AP) _ Police arrested 10 people suspected
of involvement in the murder of five family members killed in a
hail of rifle and pistol fire.
	   Police Inspector Bonisile Mkupa said the dead included a 12-year
old girl. Police were searching for several other suspects whose
identity were known.
	   Four other family members injured in the weekend attack on their
house in the eastern KwaZulu-Natal Province were under police guard
in a hospital.
	   The family belonged to an organization that gathered information
on stock theft and cattle rustling whose members have been the
target of revenge attacks in the past.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ You have to be Croatian and very lucky to get one
of the scarce tickets being offered through World Cup channels for
the France-Croatia semifinal match Wednesday.
	   FIFA said 230 seats will be offered ``to Croatian nationals
only'' during a four-hour period Tuesday night at Stade de France
in suburban Paris.
	   French fans have gobbled up most of the 80,000 seats for the
match that will decide which of the two teams play in Sunday's
World Cup finale against either Brazil or the Netherlands.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ Pele thinks Brazil isn't playing its best soccer,
England's David Beckham didn't deserve the red card and the best
teams so far have been France and the Netherlands.
	   Brazil can do a better job and isn't working well together, Pele
was quoted in an interview in L'Equipe's Tuesday edition.
	   ``We've had some little problems with coordination. Luckily we
qualified but Brazil can play better,'' Pele told the French sports
daily.
	   He was critical of the World Cup's tough stance on tackling from
behind, saying FIFA ``creates difficulty for the defenders who are
now afraid of getting a yellow or red card.''
	   ``We also see strikers dramatize things after a tackle to
provoke a card. The confusion in these circumstances creates
different attitudes in referees and inevitably mistakes,'' he was
quoted in the interview.
	   Such as the expulsion of David Beckham in the Argentina-England
second-round match?
	   ``Oh yes, I didn't see it very well the first time. But now I
think that Simeone is ... a good actor,'' Pele was quoted.
``Unfortunately England was eliminated and with it Michael Owen who
was the great surprise for me.''
	   Pele said he liked this World Cup better that the two because
the game is open and there are lots of goals.
	   ``The best looking teams I've seen are France and the
Netherlands. They play to win,'' Pele added in the interview.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ Referees are paid dollars 25,000 for their work at
World Cup matches, and assistants get 20,000 dollars, FIFA
disclosed Tuesday.
	   The game officials also get dlrs 200 daily for expenses and are
given free housing during their stays at the France 98 tournament,
spokesman Keith Cooper said.
	   Thirty-two referees from various FIFA-member countries were
picked to officiate first-round matches. Based on their
performances, which were evaluated after each match, some were
asked to stay on for the second and subsequent rounds.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ Brazil's semifinal against the Netherlands is ``do
or die'' for Brazil's Dunga. The Brazilian captain told L'Equipe
newspaper that he's concerned about the reaction at home in the
event of a loss.
	   The French sports newspaper asked Dunga if he thought Brazil
would built a statue in his honor if he came home with the World
Cup.
	   ``I hardly believe that,'' Dunga was quoted responding. ``One
thing is sure, on the other hand, if we lose, they're going to kill
me!''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ France has taken over first place in FIFA's Fair
Play competition at the World Cup, just ahead of England.
	   Spokesman Keith Cooper announced Tuesday that France has 845
points, with England slipping back to second with 828. Norway is
third, 822, and Brazil fourth, 817.
	   The award goes to the team showing the most sportsmanship during
the month-long tournament ending Sunday.
	   FIFA already made a point of congratulating Emmanuel Petit of
France for his good sportsmanship during the France-Italy game last
Saturday, saying he was in the running for the individual trophy.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ FIFA is sponsoring a multi-year study of 700 soccer
players in three European nations to pinpoint the chief causes and
ways to prevent injuries, medical experts said Tuesday.
	   Dr. Jiri Dvorak, a member of FIFA's medical commission, said the
study encompasses soccer players of all levels, from amateurs to
professionals, ages 14 and up, in France, Germany and
Czechoslovakia.
	   Playing hours and types of injuries are charted to determine the
effects of such dangerous actions as tackling from behind and
tackling from the side, Dvorak told reporters Tuesday at the World
Cup.
	   He said the study, under way for a year, has shown that back
aches are the most common complaint among soccer players,
indicating that more attention needs to be given to strengthening
the upper body, not just the legs, of those playing the sport.
	   The FIFA medical committee plans to undertake similar studies on
other continents where playing conditions, training methods and
nutrition are different enough from Europe to warrant separate
research, Dvorak said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The U.N. refugee agency said Tuesday it is
preparing its refugee return operations in Bosnia against outbreaks
of ethnic violence if Croatia's soccer team wins the World Cup.
	   ``We have been doing some contingency planning to safeguard some
of our return projects in areas which might be targeted by people
celebrating an eventual victory,'' said UNHCR spokeswoman Judith
Kumin.
	   A water tanker and two buses used to return refugees were
destroyed in the town of Stolac on July 2 when Bosnian Croat
celebrations of Croatia's 3-0 World Cup victory against Germany
turned violent, Kumin said.
	   Some 200 Bosnian Croats marched through a street where Bosnian
Muslims are rebuilding homes, throwing stones and breaking windows.
Local police didn't intervene in time to prevent damages, Kumin
said.
	   Stolac, 115 kilometers (72 miles) southwest of the Bosnian
capital Sarajevo, is one of the worst hot-spots of ethnic violence
against refugees in Bosnia.
	   Violence following Croatia's victory also flared in other parts
of Bosnia. In the divided city of Mostar, a 25-year-old Muslim
woman was killed and a man was seriously wounded on the Muslim side
when they were hit by bullets fired in celebration from the Croat
side, Bosnian radio reported.

EU clears British Aerospace stake in Saab
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union regulators Tuesday
approved the acquisition by British Aerospace PLC of a 35 percent
stake in Swedish aircraft company Saab AB.
	   The European Commission said the operation will strengthen both
companies' positions in the European defense industry but not cause
serious competition concerns since they face strong competition
from European and American companies.
	   ``The operation is a further step towards the transnational
restructuring and consolidation of the European defense industry,''
the Commission said in a statement.
	   Overlap between Saab and British Aerospace on their respective
home markets is ``insignificant,'' the Commission added.
	   The new joint venture will operate in the markets for military
aerospace and guided weapons systems and components.

Albanian militants forced to abandon village, Serbs report
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with sporadic firing reported around Lodja, raises
casualty count; release of Serbs; Yugoslav army incursion into
Albania; trims.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police battling ethnic Albanian
insurgents in a village near one of Kosovo's largest cities forced
them to retreat, Serb sources reported Tuesday.
	   The pro-government Serb Media Center said that the Kosovo
Liberation Army retreated from Lodja village overnight in the
region near the southwestern city of Pec. With phone lines cut and
the main road leading into the region sealed off by Serb police for
security reasons, there were few details on the situation Tuesday,
but ethnic Albanian sources said sporadic shooting persisted in and
around the village on Tuesday.
	   The fighting flared Monday, with the ethnic-Albanian-run Kosovo
Information Center reporting one person killed and three wounded by
heavy shelling of Lodja village, near Pec.
	   Serb sources said armed Albanians opened fire on Serb villagers,
forcing a Serb counter-attack.
	   The Serb Media Center reported two policemen killed and nine
others wounded in the fighting at Lodja. The Media Center said that
11 civilians and two policemen were evacuated overnight from Lodja,
and large quantities of weapons were collected after fleeing KLA
forces left them behind.
	   In neighboring Albania, the interior ministry reported a weekend
incursion of about 20 soldiers of the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army.
The group took up combat positions for about an hour Sunday before
returning to home territory, said the ministry.
	   There was no official comment from Yugoslavia.
	   Militant ethnic Albanians fighting for independence for Kosovo
province from the southern Yugoslav republic of Serbia have been
regrouping and arming themselves inside the Albanian border for
months.
	   Last month, Yugoslav soldiers firing across the border killed an
Albanian man and two mules in an apparent effort to stop pack
trains carrying weapons across the border into Kosovo.
	   Closer to Pristina, tensions were high in the 3,000-member
community of Pirane, 75 kilometers (45 miles) southwest of the
provincial capital, following the burials of three ethnic Albanian
farmers.
	   Official Serb reports said the three were murdered by their own
people for betraying them. But the villagers say the slayings are
the handiwork of Serb police.
	   The contradictory allegations highlight the constant conflicting
propaganda in Serbia's disputed Kosovo province, where ethnic
Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1. Western diplomats hope to bring
some clarity to the confusion with the launch this week of a
multi-national observer mission.
	   Since Serb forces launched a crackdown on ethnic Albanian
militants on Feb. 28, a tangle of roadblocks have prevented any
outside observers from confirming reports of fighting. Information
is largely channeled through centers representing either side.
	   The relatives' claims of summary execution by police came hours
after the Serb Media Center told reporters that ethnic Albanian
militants killed the three with automatic weapons because they were
loyal to the Serbs. Serbia is one of the two remaining republics in
Yugoslavia.
	   In a separate report, the Media Center said that KLA fighters
released two Serbs kidnapped several days ago and handed them over
to the International Red Cross. And both Serb and Albanian sources
reported that the body of an ethnic Albanian apparently killed as
part of the ethnic feuding was found close to Orahovac, about 40
kilometers (25 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo. Recent attempts
to bring ethnic Albanian leaders and the Yugoslav government to the
negotiating table have produced few results.
	   Western observers, Belgrade-based diplomats from the United
States, Russia, Poland and the European Union will regularly tour
villages in Kosovo to try and clarify the situation on the ground.
	   They also will share information with humanitarian organizations
struggling to cope with a flood of refugees and conflicts in the
remote Kosovo mountains where neighboring Serb and ethnic Albanian
villages form a checkerboard of front lines.

MCI-Worldcom merger to get EU go-ahead, official says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ European Union regulators are scheduled
Wednesday to approve the dlrs 37 billion merger between U.S.
telecommunications groups MCI Communications Corp. and Worldcom
Inc., a senior EU official said here Tuesday.
	   ``Tomorrow, the Commission will announce the green light,'' EU
Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert said. ``There is no
problem any more on MCI.''
	   The European Commission, the EU's 20-member executive body, is
to hold its regular weekly meeting in Brussels on Wednesday to
approve the deal, he said.
	   Van Miert was speaking in Lisbon where he is attending a seminar
on anti-trust policy.
	   Under EU rules, the Commission checks mergers with a major
impact on markets within the 15-nation bloc and can demand changes
to, or veto, those it judges to infringe European laws governing
fair competition.
	   MCI has agreed to divest all overlapping businesses, primarily
the entire MCI Internet business. The EU conditions include retail
level Internet assets, Van Miert said.
	   MCI and Worldcom are the second- and fourth-largest
long-distance telephone companies in the United States. Their
alliance, proposed in November, would surpass Bell Atlantic's dlrs
25.6 billion 1997 takeover of Nynex and continue the global trend
toward consolidation of the telecommunications industry.
	   Van Miert stressed that EU authorities have cooperated closely
with the U.S. Department of Justice, which is also looking into the
planned merger.
	   The link-up now awaits the conclusion of the U.S. antitrust
investigation.

World Cup: charity match for French policeman postponed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A charity match to raise money for the French
policeman left in a coma after being bludgeoned by German hooligans
has been postponed until September, German soccer federation
president Egidius Braun said Tuesday.
	   The game involving French and German veterans had been scheduled
for Saturday, the day before the World Cup final.
	   But Braun said it would be senseless to have the game without
German fans, who had left France after their country's elimination
in the quarterfinals.
	   The match will now be held in mid-September, somewhere in
Germany near the border with France.
	   The policeman, Daniel Nivel, a 44-year-old father of two, is
still in a coma.
	   He was hit on the head by a group of German neo-Nazi hooligans
July 21, when Germany played Yugoslavia in Lens.
	   Three people have been arrested in the attack.

Russian markets plummet again amid talks with IMF
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Chubais saying key issues on loans to
be decided Thursday, ADDS byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN IAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia and the International Monetary Fund along
with the World Bank will decide key issues on granting new loans to
Russia by the end of the week, a top official said Tuesday.
	   Russian financial markets suffered another heavy hit Tuesday,
forcing the Central Bank to intervene to prop up the Russian
currency.
	   The stock market was down more than 7 percent by midday and
interest rates on short-term government bonds shot up to 120
percent, from an 90 percent on Monday.
	   Russia is seeking a loan of at least dlrs 10 billion from the
International Monetary Fund and other international lenders to
stabilize its markets.
	   Anatoly Chubais, Russia's representative to international
lenders, met with officials of the IMF and the World Bank for two
hours. He said afterward the parties would meet again Thursday to
settle outstanding issues.
	   ``We wanted to resolve all principal issues in a tight time
frame, by the end of the week, and spend the next week on working
out practical problems,'' he said, according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   Chubais said Tuesday's talks were complicated.
	   ``There is understanding for Russia's tough position, but one
can't just lose heart, and the actions of the government must
stimulate growth,'' Chubais said.
	   Martin Gilman, the IMF's chief representative in Moscow, said
additional aid to Russia will depend on the government's
destabilization package, which is being considered by parliament,
ITAR-Tass said.
	   Michael Carter, the World Bank's Moscow representative, said
Russian can only lay the groundwork for economic growth through
structural reforms.
	   If the government's stabilization program becomes bogged down in
the State Duma, parliament's lower house, President Boris Yeltsin
may sign many of bills into law in the form of decrees.
	   Russian markets have been wracked by turmoil in recent months
due to the government's shaky finances, the drop in world oil
prices and the spillover from the Asian economic crisis.
	   The stock market has lost more than half its value this year and
the interest rates on government bonds have soared to unsustainable
levels.
	   But so far the problems have been limited to the markets and
have had little effect on ordinary Russians. The government's
greatest fear is that the currency will fall, which would increase
prices and directly effect all Russians.

Museveni arrives to try his hand at mediation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ABEBE ANDUALEM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
Tuesday became the latest in a series of international emmisaries
to the Ethiopian capital to try his hand at securing a peaceful
resolution to the two-month border conflict between Ethiopia and
Eritrea.
	   The Ugandan leader was to meet with Ethiopian President Meles
Zenawi following talks Monday with President Isaias Afwerki in
neighboring Eritrea.
	   Since May 6 Ethiopia and Eritrea have been locked in an
occasionally violent conflict over disputed border areas.
	   In early June both countries bombed targets on each other's
territory, and hundreds were killed in clashes at several border
fronts.
	   There have been no reports of fighting in recent days, but both
governments have massed armies along their common border and
continue to blame the other for the heightened tensions.
	   Museveni follows President Laurent Kabila of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, whose visit last week yielded no results.
	   Four ambassadors representing the Addis Ababa-based Organization
of African Unity have also been working to find a solution to the
standoff after leaders from Burkina Fasso, Zimbabwe, Rwanda and
Djibouti met with both governments last month.
	   Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu said Monday his country had
decided to pull out of the OAU medation team July 3 after it became
apparent that Rwanda's involvement endangered the possible success
of the OAU effort.
	   Speaking to reporters in the Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam
Monday, Bizimungu said after Eritrea had rejected an initial peace
proposal put forward by Rwanda and the United States, it became
evident that Eritrea would not regard Rwanda's participation in the
group as ``a new process.''
	   But he said his country still supported the OAU efforts.
	   Prime Minister Meles said Monday that while no tangile results
have resulted from any of the mediation efforts, he still hoped the
conflict could be resolved peacefully.
	   ``But if the Eritrean government persists in its refusal to
withdraw its forces from Ethiopian teritory, I would like to ...
assure parliament and the Ethiopian people that we will safeguard
by force our sovereignty and territorial integrity,'' Meles told
parliament Tuesday.
	   After fighting alongside rebels attempting to overthrow the
Etiopian military regime in 1991, Eritrean rebels, who had been
fighting Ethiopia for 30 years, were rewarded with independence in
1993. Now, each country blames the other for occupying parts of its
territory.
	   Meles told parliament tens of thousands of youths have signed up
for the army and are training to fight.
	   He said the government has collected 100 million birr (dlrs 14
million) from public donations for the war effort.

Mostar airport opens despite local obstruction
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSTAR, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ After months of delay due to
political disputes, Mostar airport opened on Tuesday to civilian
flights for the first time since 1992.
	   Carlos Westendorp, the top international official in Bosnia, cut
the ribbon as other officials, including U.S. envoy to the Balkan
Robert Gelbard, looked on.
	   The airport, 100 kilometers (62 miles) south of Sarajevo, has
been closed to all except NATO flights since the start of the
Bosnian war in 1992.
	   Mostar will be Bosnia's third civilian airport along with
Sarajevo and Banja Luka.
	   The European Union and NATO helped reconstruct the terminal, but
were not able to solve political problems delaying its opening. The
airport is split between Bosnian Croat and Muslim territory.
	   When officials failed to agree on who would run the airport,
Westendorp appointed three Muslims, three Croats and an
international chairman, to run the airport for the first six
months.
	   Under the Dayton peace agreement, Bosnia is divided into two
regions - the Serb republic and the Muslim-Croat federation.
Westendorp has the power to decide issues Bosnian leaders cannot
agree upon.
	   Mostar and its airport is supposed to be shared between Muslims
and Croats but the city and the entire southern region remains
divided.
	   Westendorp hopes opening the airport will bring the communities
together. ``Above all, airports stand for normality,'' he said.
``Airports mean business: and business means jobs,'' he said.
	   A Croatian Airlines plane from Zagreb was the first to land at
Mostar on Tuesday, followed by an Air Bosna plane from Sarajevo.

Lotte loses record-setting No. 17 in 12 innings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Chiba Lotte Marines set a Japanese professional
baseball record Tuesday by losing their 17th consecutive game _ but
it took them 12 innings to do it.
	   Orix BlueWave pinch hitter Takayasu Hironaga hit a grand slam
home run in the bottom of the 12th, giving the BlueWave a 7-3
victory at Kobe.
	   Harvey Jerome Pulliam had stopped the Marines from winning by
tying the game with a two-run home run in the bottom of the ninth.
	   The homers were Hironaga's first of the season and Pulliam's
11th.
	   The old record of 16 consecutive defeats was set by the former
DaiTokyo team in 1936 and tied by the Yakult Swallows in 1970.
	   Meanwhile, Nigel Wilson hit a home run and reliever Erick
Shullstrom pitched a hitless last inning, leading the Pacific
League's front-running Nippon Ham Fighters to a 5-4 victory over
the Kintetsu Buffaloes at Tokyo Dome.
	   The winning run scored in the eighth inning on an error by
Buffaloes' second baseman Takashi Mutoh on a ground ball hit by
Wilson.
	   Wilson, formerly with the Cleveland Indians, has 14 homers.
	   Shullstrom, formerly with the Minnesota Twins, picked up his
sixth save.
	   The victory widened the Fighters' lead over the second-place
Buffaloes to seven games.
	   At Maebashi, Luis Lopez, formerly with the Cleveland Indians,
doubled home two runs in the fourth inning and the Fukuoka Daiei
Hawks blanked the Seibu Lions 11-0.
	   In the Central League, Akihiro Yano doubled home two runs
against relief ace Kazuhiro Sasaki in the bottom of the ninth
inning, giving the Hanshin Tigers a 2-1 victory over the
front-running Yokohama BayStars at Osaka Dome.
	   Sasaki gave up two hits and two runs and took the loss. He now
is 0-1, with his string of consecutive saves ended at 22.
	   The BayStars are still one game ahead of the Chunichi Dragons,
who beat the Yakult Swallows 7-2 at Nagoya Dome.
	   The Dragons' Kazuki Inoue doubled home the winning run in the
two-run sixth inning.
	   At Sapporo, Tomonori Maeda hit a two-run home run in the first
inning and Itsuki Asai slugged a three-run homer in the third as
the Hiroshima Toyo Carp beat the Yomiuri Giants 10-5.
	   Nathan Minchey, formerly with the Boston Red Sox, limited the
Giants to eight scattered hits over 7 2/3 innings for his eighth
victory against six defeats.
	   Maeda has 13 homers and Asai two.

Israel places great weight on visit of South African official
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel is placing great weight on the visit of
the highest South African government official to visit since Nelson
Mandela took power, foreign ministry officials said Tuesday.
	   Aziz Pahad, South Africa's deputy foreign affairs minister, is
scheduled to begin a two-day visit here on Thursday. Officials said
they will use the visit both to present Israel's position on the
faltering peace talks with the Palestinians and to bolster economic
relations between the two countries.
	   Israel maintained close ties with South Africa's apartheid
government before Mandela's government came to power in the
country's first all-race elections in 1994, and reportedly helped
develop the country's nuclear program in the 1970s and 1980s.
	   Uri Oren, Israel's ambassador to South Africa, said members of
Mandela's government who struggled for years against white-minority
rule have been sympathetic to the Palestinian cause.
	   ``Although their policy is formally an even-handed one, there
has been criticism of the peace process,'' Oren said, ``They
identify with Palestinian struggle for liberation.''
	   Israel-Palestinian negotiations have been stalled since March
1997 and are now deadlocked over the scope of a promised Israeli
troop pullback in the West Bank.
	   Economic relations between Israel and South Africa are strong,
officials said. A total of dlrs 3 billion in trade is generated a
year between the countries, a sizable percentage of which involves
the diamond industry.
	   During his stay, Pahad will visit meet Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and President Ezer Weizman. He will also tour the
Palestinian areas and Egypt and Jordan.

World Cup: No underestimating Croatians, French say
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ In no way is France
underestimating Croatia for Wednesday's World Cup semifinal. Coach
Aime Jacquet says he's been in awe of the Balkan team for two
years.
	   Ever since Croatia made its international debut at the 1996
European Championships, where it reached the quarterfinals, Jacquet
has witnessed the steady ascendance that propelled the debutant
into the World Cup semifinal.
	   ``I've been watching them with a very keen eye since Euro 96.
Two years later, they are better performing, better balanced and
more experienced,'' said Jacquet.
	   And the upward line is also evident at the World Cup. After
starting slowly against Jamaica and Japan, and even losing to
Argentina, there has been no stopping the Croatians.
	   They won 1-0 against Romania, but the world really first took
notice when they sank the German juggernaut 3-0 last week. ``A
result like that needed no comment whatsoever,'' said Jacquet.
	   ``We've seen a team that has really responded to the
challenge,'' said Jacquet.
	   French captain Didier Deschamps played under Miroslav Blazevic
at FC Nantes a decade ago, well before the coach took over the
national team of Croatia.
	   ``He has given the team rigor and a defensive bloc that only
took two goals so far. He gave it a good balance between defense
and attack,'' Deschamps said.
	   Deschamps also warned against Blazevic's psychological warfare,
saying, ``He can be a charmer and put you to sleep that way.''
	   Blazevic has repeatedly proclaimed that France is his personal
World Cup favorite.
	   Deschamps also had first-hand experience at Nantes of his
motivational strength, so much in evidence in the tightly-knit
Croatian team.
	   ``He has a great way of instilling faith and a hunger for
victory,'' he said.
	   Blazevic's time spent in France also gave him great insight into
the workings of French soccer. ``He knows our mentality well,''
said Jacquet.

Fundamentalists vow to build controversial Hindu temple in three

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Hindu fundamentalists vowed Tuesday that
no matter what the Supreme Court says, they will start building a
Hindu temple at the site of a demolished mosque in three years _ as
soon as sculptors complete pillars, arches and images of gods and
goddesses for the controversial shrine.
	   The fundamentalists are members of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, or
World Hindu Council, which led demolition of a mosque at the site
in 1992. The attack on the mosque set off religious riots across
the country in which more than 2,000 people, and there are fears
any attempt to build a temple will result in more Hindu-Muslim
clashes.
	   The Supreme Court has been asked to decide the future of the
site in Ayodhya, 550 kilometers (350 miles ) east of New Delhi.
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party, which
is closely linked to the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, has promised to
abide by judicial opinion. The court has set no date for issuing
its ruling.
	   VHP leaders say they do not believe the court had any authority
in religious matters.
	   ``God is higher than the constitution,'' said Ashok Singhal, VHP
general secretary.
	   The VHP brought 75 Hindu priests from all over the country to
New Delhi Monday and Tuesday to discuss the temple issue.
	   Mahant Ram Chandra Paramhans, chairman of a VHP committee
planning the temple, said the priests favored going ahead with
construction as soon as preparations were completed. Under the
VHP's direction, artisans have been working for the past several
years in a field near the mosque's rubble, chiseling images of gods
and goddesses from chunks of sandstone.
	   ``Our engineers say that it will take three years to finish the
preparatory work,'' Paramhans said. ``It will take another six
months to complete the temple after that.''
	   The VHP says the mosque at Ayodhya was built by Mogul invaders
who destroyed a temple built at the birthplace of Ram, Hinduism's
supreme god.

Thailand bans establishment of new inland shrimp farms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Cabinet on Tuesday approved
a ban on freshwater shrimp farming, but in a compromise decided to
allow existing farms to keep operating.
	   The government's National Environmental Board had proposed a
total ban on the cultivation of black tiger shrimp in all areas
away from the country's seacoasts.
	   Waste water from shrimp farms causes serious damage to nearby
land, and farmers often have neither the will nor the means to stop
it.
	   The environment in many of Thailand's coastal mangrove forests
has already been devastated by shrimp farming, and the board said
it sought to keep the problem from spreading.
	   The Royal Fisheries Department, however, lobbied successfully
for existing inland shrimp farms to be exempted from the ban.
	   The new regulation places strict controls on the wastes, barring
farms from releasing them into natural waterways and making farm
operators liable for damage to neighboring areas.
	   The environmental board said it did not believe the strict
standards could be successfully enforced.

German foreign minister plans fact-finding trip on Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel will
travel near Serbia's troubled Kosovo province this week and discuss
the crisis there with his Russian counterpart in Moscow on
Saturday, the Foreign Ministry said Tuesday.
	   Kinkel will leave Bonn on Wednesday after the meeting of the
six-nation Contact Group on the Balkans, stopping first in Albania,
his office said.
	   After meeting with government officials there, he plans to take
a helicopter Thursday to northern Albania, where thousands of
ethnic Albanian refugees from Kosovo are camped.
	   Later he will fly to Macedonia, another country bordering
Kosovo, before returning to Germany Thursday night.
	   Kinkel was to meet with Russia's foreign minister, Yevgeny
Primakov, this weekend in Germany, but his office said Primakov was
unable to leave Moscow because of last-minute duties, so Kinkel
will fly there on Saturday.

EU takes Ireland to court over water pollution, warns five
</HEADLINE>
countries &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union's executive
Commission said Tuesday it will take Ireland to court for failing
to integrate EU norms on water pollution into national legislation.
	   The Commission also warned Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, Austria
and the Netherlands it would take them before the European Court of
Justice if they fail to adopt EU standards on water pollution
within the next two months.
	   Ireland will be sued for not adopting EU rules on the protection
of water against pollution caused by substances such as mineral
oils, hydrocarbons, and various heavy metals such as phosphorus and
nitrites.
	   The Commission threatened to take Belgium, Luxembourg and
Germany to court if they failing to adopt EU laws on water
pollution caused by nitrates from agriculture, the Commission said.
	   Under an EU law on nitrates, EU countries were expected by 1993
to identify zones affected by nitrate-related pollution and set up
programs to tackle the pollution by 1995.
	   The Commission warned Austria and the Netherlands for violating
EU norms on the quality and regular monitoring of bathing water.
	   The Netherlands should have met these standards by 1985. In the
case of Austria, the proper legislation should have been adopted by
Jan. 1, 1997.
	   The European Court of Justice is based in Luxembourg.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of separatist protesters,
some carrying arrows, spears and daggers, demonstrated Tuesday
against Indonesian control of the remote province of Irian Jaya.
	   Social workers, meanwhile, said a pro-independence activist who
was shot in a separate rally on Monday had died in a hospital.
	   Protests have been building in Irian Jaya, where a small group
of separatist rebels operates. Activists have been emboldened by
political reforms sweeping Indonesia in the wake of the May
resignation of authoritarian President Suharto.
	   However, the government is unwilling to consider independence
for mineral-rich Irian Jaya, a former Dutch colony that was taken
over by Indonesia in 1963. The province in eastern Indonesia
comprises the western half of New Guinea.
	   In the highland town of Wamena, hundreds of protesters rallied
Tuesday at the local government building and hoisted a flag of a
guerrilla band called the Free Papua Movement.
	   Some of the protesters carried traditional weapons such as
daggers and spears, the official Antara news agency quoted army Lt.
Col. Herry Risdiyanto as saying. There were no reports of violence.
	   On Monday, troops in the town of Biak fired rubber bullets at
demonstrators who had refused to lower a rebel flag.
	   Ruben Orboy, a man in his late 20s, was hit in the head and died
of his wound later the same day, said an official with the
Indonesian Red Cross. He requested anonymity.
	   Earlier, the Indonesian military denied unconfirmed reports that
up to seven protesters were killed. That claim came from the
Australia West Papua Association, a Sydney-based group of
supporters of independence for the province.
	   Two dozen people were injured in the clash. About 180 people
were arrested, but most of them have been released.
	   Biak lies 3,200 kilometers (2,000 miles) northeast of Jakarta,
the Indonesian capital.
	   Last week, demonstrators battled security forces in Jayapura,
the capital of Irian Jaya. One police officer who was beaten by
protesters died in a hospital this past weekend, and two students
who were shot remain in critical condition.
	   In Jakarta Tuesday, Gen. Wiranto, chief of the Indonesian armed
forces, warned that the military will take stern action against
anyone hoisting a flag other than the country's red and white
emblem.
	   The armed forces ``will not tolerate it,'' Wiranto said, adding
that they ``consider it as an insult and negation of the Indonesian
state.''
	   Meanwhile, a two-member investigation team from the National
Commission on Human Rights has postponed a visit to Irian Jaya,
originally scheduled July 11-14, because one of the members is ill,
the commission said.
	   However, commission member Clementino Dos Reis Amaral said the
commission has assigned a liaison officer to act as its
representative there.
	   The separatist movement in Irian Jaya is not as widespread as
the campaign for independence in East Timor, where anti-Indonesian
protesters have demonstrated in recent weeks. Indonesia invaded the
former Portuguese colony in 1975 and annexed it a year later.

World Cup: Croatia's eccentric coach has that master touch
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Sports-Soccer-France-Croatia &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Miroslav Blazevic believes in things like white
scarves, gendarme's hats and his astrologist's charts. There's
nothing haphazard, though, when he plots Croatia's strategy.
	   A keen student of military history, Blazevic compares game plans
to battle plans.
	   Explaining how his team stunned Germany 3-0 in the
quarterfinals, Blazevic talked of Rommel, the ``desert fox'' German
field marshal who lost the crucial battle in World War II in
northern Africa when his tanks ran out of fuel.
	   ``I wanted to neutralize German fuel _ Oliver Bierhoff can jump
as high as he can, but if he doesn't have enough crosses, he won't
achieve anything,'' Blazevic said after the game.
	   The veteran coach, who is 63, has a had a long career in former
Yugoslavia, Switzerland, France and Greece.
	   Blazevic was born in Travnik, in central Bosnia-Herzegovina.
Nicknamed Ciro (pronounced Chee-roh), Blazevic played for Sarajevo,
Rijeka and Dinamo Zagreb, all three in the former Yugoslav top
division.
	   He then went to Switzerland and played for Vevey and Sion, and
began his coaching career in that country. He won the Swiss league
title with Grasshopper Zurich, the cup with Sion and also coached
the Swiss national team before returning to Yugoslavia.
	   In 1982, he guided Dinamo Zagreb to its only Yugoslav league
title. As a lucky charm, he wore a luck-bringing white scarf to all
the games that season.
	   Blazevic appears attached to things like that. In France, he's
wearing a gendarme's hat, given to him by police in Vittel, the
training camp town in eastern France.
	   He also receives a fax from his astrologist in Zagreb before
every game. So far, the astrologist has been predicting correctly.
	   An eloquent and shrewd man with a passion for chocolate and
cigarettes, Blazevic is a master motivator, who gets his players
bursting with confidence and enthusiasm.
	   ``He knows how to stimulate players to be part of a team and to
work as a team,'' said Croatian soccer federation boss Branko
Miksa. ``He knows the psychology of each player, he knows soccer,
and he knows how to bring the two together.''
	   Often given to audacious exaggerations, Blazevic is said by some
critics to be a megalomaniac who likes to pull all the strings.
That earned him another nickname _ Atilla.
	   When Croatia gained independence from Yugoslavia in 1991,
Blazevic returned to Dinamo (now renamed Croatia) _ becoming its
president, coach and majority share owner. He has since given up
these duties for a seat on the club's board.
	   Blazevic coached Nantes in France and was jailed for 17 days in
1995 after being implicated in the match-rigging scandal involving
Olympique Marseille. No charges were filed.
	   After Croatia was knocked out by Germany in the quarterfinals of
the 1996 European Championship, Blazevic resigned, but the Croatian
federation didn't accept it and he stayed on.
	   He's in his fifth year as coach. A fervent nationalist, Blazevic
is rumored to have been tapped personally by Croatian President
Franjo Tudjman.

Scientist: New dinosaur species discovered
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A cat-like, flesh-eating dinosaur discovered in
fossils on an island off the south coast of England is from a
previously unknown species, a British paleontologist said Tuesday.
	   The remains, found early last year by an amateur fossil
collector in a crumbling coastal cliff, show that the 12-foot-long
(3.6-meter) creature was equipped with murderous claws, razor sharp
teeth and unusually long hind legs on which it ran at high speed.
	   ``Nothing quite like it has been seen before,'' said Steve Hutt,
curator of the Isle of Wight Museum of Geology at Sandown, who is
heading the excavation. ``We know we've got a new specimen.''
	   Hutt said a scientific paper on the discovery will not be
published for a while, but that he had checked with two American
experts and museums around the world and could not find anything
similar.
	   ``You couldn't look at a skeleton of the same age and same group
_ it just doesn't exist,'' he said.
	   The dinosaur bears some resemblance to a Velociraptor, the
clawed dinosaur that was one of the creatures depicted in the movie
``Jurassic Park,'' Hutt said.
	   ``This was an animal which was incredibly graceful as well as
being very tough. It had very long, powerful hands with big claws,
and very long back legs,'' he said. ``We were absolutely stunned by
the length of the fibula and tibia (leg bones). It was something
completely new.''
	   The dinosaur had a very long tail, up to twice the length of its
body, Hutt said.
	   ``It was a lithe, whippy thing that moved very fast as it hunted
different kinds of prey,'' he said.
	   He said the quality of the latest find was ``quite
breathtaking,'' noting that most small, meat-eating dinosaurs are
badly preserved.
	   It will take a year or two before all the fossil remains are
excavated. So far, a portion of the skull and jaw, both hands and
arms, elements of both feet, a piece of the tail, vertebrae and
ribs have been discovered, Hutt said.
	   He said the most important factor in determining a new species
is usually the skull.
	   ``We have enough of the skull in this to say, `Hey, we don't
have this in other dinosaurs. We have a new one,' '' he said.
``There are also other various bones which give us bits of
evidence.''
	   He said the dinosaur had been swept up in a flood 120 million
years ago, ``cartwheeled around'' and dumped at the site where it
was found.
	   The precise location is being kept secret to protect it from an
invasion of curious visitors. It is in a region where pieces of the
cliff have been falling into the sea, exposing hidden fossils.
	   Two years ago, another previously unknown dinosaur, Neovenator
salerii, a smaller version of Tyrannosaurus rex, was found there.

Vancouver woman avoids jail term in for severing husband's penis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Note contents &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) _ A 38-year-old mother of six
has been spared a jail term after pleading guilty to cutting off
her husband's penis because he refused to end an affair with a
younger woman.
	   Kim Tran received a two-year conditional sentence Monday that
requires her to attending counseling with her children and
participate in life skills classes as directed by her bail
supervisor.
	   She pleaded guilty last month in British Columbia Supreme Court
to aggravated assault.
	   The court was told that when Vi Hoc Phung, 42, returned home to
his wife of 18 years about 3 a.m. on July 1, 1997, Tran pleaded
with him to leave the other woman.
	   Phung ignored his wife's crying and pleading. He sat and drank
beer, telling her to leave him alone so he could sleep.
	   After he went to sleep, Tran took a meat cleaver from the
kitchen, pulled down his pants and cut off his penis, according to
testimony.
	   ``I begged him but he didn't listen,'' Tran told a police
officer.
	   Under normal circumstances, said Justice Patrick Dohm, he would
have sent Tran to prison because her act will have long-lasting
physical and psychological effects on Phung, from whom she is now
separated.
	   But because Tran now is the sole support of her six children,
aged 4 to 16, the circumstances are far from normal, Dohm said.
	   ``These children are entirely dependent on their mother,'' the
judge said. ``It would be expected that the six kids would end up
in foster homes, probably divided and with lasting effect.''
	   Plastic surgeons managed to reconstruct a penis for Phung, but
doctors say he can't have normal sex and may have urinary problems
later in life.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ You have to be Croatian and very lucky to get one
of the scarce tickets being offered through World Cup channels for
the France-Croatia semifinal match Wednesday.
	   FIFA said 230 seats will be offered ``to Croatian nationals
only'' during a four-hour period Tuesday night at Stade de France
in suburban Paris.
	   French fans have gobbled up most of the 80,000 seats for the
match that will decide which of the two teams play in Sunday's
World Cup finale against either Brazil or the Netherlands.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ Pele thinks Brazil isn't playing its best soccer,
England's David Beckham didn't deserve the red card and the best
teams so far have been France and the Netherlands.
	   Brazil can do a better job and isn't working well together, Pele
was quoted in an interview in L'Equipe's Tuesday edition.
	   ``We've had some little problems with coordination. Luckily we
qualified but Brazil can play better,'' Pele told the French sports
daily.
	   He was critical of the World Cup's tough stance on tackling from
behind, saying FIFA ``creates difficulty for the defenders who are
now afraid of getting a yellow or red card.''
	   ``We also see strikers dramatize things after a tackle to
provoke a card. The confusion in these circumstances creates
different attitudes in referees and inevitably mistakes,'' he was
quoted in the interview.
	   Such as the expulsion of David Beckham in the Argentina-England
second-round match?
	   ``Oh yes, I didn't see it very well the first time. But now I
think that Simeone is ... a good actor,'' Pele was quoted.
``Unfortunately England was eliminated and with it Michael Owen who
was the great surprise for me.''
	   Pele said he liked this World Cup better that the two because
the game is open and there are lots of goals.
	   ``The best looking teams I've seen are France and the
Netherlands. They play to win,'' Pele added in the interview.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ Referees are paid dollars 25,000 for their work at
World Cup matches, and assistants get 20,000 dollars, FIFA
disclosed Tuesday.
	   The game officials also get dlrs 200 daily for expenses and are
given free housing during their stays at the France 98 tournament,
spokesman Keith Cooper said.
	   Thirty-two referees from various FIFA-member countries were
picked to officiate first-round matches. Based on their
performances, which were evaluated after each match, some were
asked to stay on for the second and subsequent rounds.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ Brazil's semifinal against the Netherlands is ``do
or die'' for Brazil's Dunga. The Brazilian captain told L'Equipe
newspaper that he's concerned about the reaction at home in the
event of a loss.
	   The French sports newspaper asked Dunga if he thought Brazil
would built a statue in his honor if he came home with the World
Cup.
	   ``I hardly believe that,'' Dunga was quoted responding. ``One
thing is sure, on the other hand, if we lose, they're going to kill
me!''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ France has taken over first place in FIFA's Fair
Play competition at the World Cup, just ahead of England.
	   Spokesman Keith Cooper announced Tuesday that France has 845
points, with England slipping back to second with 828. Norway is
third, 822, and Brazil fourth, 817.
	   The award goes to the team showing the most sportsmanship during
the month-long tournament ending Sunday.
	   FIFA already made a point of congratulating Emmanuel Petit of
France for his good sportsmanship during the France-Italy game last
Saturday, saying he was in the running for the individual trophy.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ FIFA is sponsoring a multi-year study of 700 soccer
players in three European nations to pinpoint the chief causes and
ways to prevent injuries, medical experts said Tuesday.
	   Dr. Jiri Dvorak, a member of FIFA's medical commission, said the
study encompasses soccer players of all levels, from amateurs to
professionals, ages 14 and up, in France, Germany and
Czechoslovakia.
	   Playing hours and types of injuries are charted to determine the
effects of such dangerous actions as tackling from behind and
tackling from the side, Dvorak told reporters Tuesday at the World
Cup.
	   He said the study, under way for a year, has shown that back
aches are the most common complaint among soccer players,
indicating that more attention needs to be given to strengthening
the upper body, not just the legs, of those playing the sport.
	   The FIFA medical committee plans to undertake similar studies on
other continents where playing conditions, training methods and
nutrition are different enough from Europe to warrant separate
research, Dvorak said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The U.N. refugee agency said Tuesday it is
preparing its refugee return operations in Bosnia against outbreaks
of ethnic violence if Croatia's soccer team wins the World Cup.
	   ``We have been doing some contingency planning to safeguard some
of our return projects in areas which might be targeted by people
celebrating an eventual victory,'' said UNHCR spokeswoman Judith
Kumin.
	   A water tanker and two buses used to return refugees were
destroyed in the town of Stolac on July 2 when Bosnian Croat
celebrations of Croatia's 3-0 World Cup victory against Germany
turned violent, Kumin said.
	   Some 200 Bosnian Croats marched through a street where Bosnian
Muslims are rebuilding homes, throwing stones and breaking windows.
Local police didn't intervene in time to prevent damages, Kumin
said.
	   Stolac, 115 kilometers (72 miles) southwest of the Bosnian
capital Sarajevo, is one of the worst hot-spots of ethnic violence
against refugees in Bosnia.
	   Violence following Croatia's victory also flared in other parts
of Bosnia. In the divided city of Mostar, a 25-year-old Muslim
woman was killed and a man was seriously wounded on the Muslim side
when they were hit by bullets fired in celebration from the Croat
side, Bosnian radio reported.

Britain's most expensive soccer player retires
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Former England soccer captain David Platt quit
Premier League champions Arsenal on Tuesday to pursue a career in
coaching.
	   The 32-year-old midfielder was an integral player in Arsenal's
FA Cup and League double last season and had one year left on his
playing contract.
	   But Platt, Britain's most expensive player with career transfers
fees exceeding 22 million pounds (dlrs 36.77 million), said the
time was right to hang up his boots.
	   In a statement released Tuesday, Platt said it was time to plan
for the next phase of his life _ a career in soccer management and
coaching.
	   ``I believe the step in turning from a player into a manager is
much bigger than most people recognize,'' he said.
	   ``The great managers of the next millennium will be the ones who
have prepared themselves the most professionally.''
	   Platt has been linked with several management offers but said he
wanted to research the job and consider his options because his
initial choices could determine his career.
	   ``I want to serve the best possible apprenticeship and then hit
the ground running,'' he said.
	   ``I intend to spend an intensive period of time learning as much
about management as I can. I have worked with some of the game's
greatest coaches and hope to be able to call on them for advice.''
	   Platt, who joined Arsenal in 1995 in a 4.75 million pound (dlrs
7.89 million) transfer from Sampdoria, said he enjoyed his playing
time at the Gunners and was leaving the club on good terms.
	   ``There could be no better way to finish than to have shared the
club's memorable achievements last season,'' he said.
	   ``When I told (manager) Arsene Wenger, he wished me good luck
and said I was making the right decision.''
	   Platt remains the world's second most expensive soccer player
behind Ronaldo in terms of combined fees.
	   In a 14-year career he has played for Crewe, Aston Villa, Bari,
Juventus, Sampdoria and Arsenal _ he scored 209 goals in 500
matches.
	   Platt played the first of his 62 games for England in 1988.
	   He played in the 1990 World Cup and then captained England in
1993 and 1994 before playing his last international match in
England's Euro '96 semifinal loss to Germany. He scored 27 goals
for England.

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Fighting in recent days between rebels
and government forces in the capital of Guinea-Bissau is thwarting
efforts to mediate an end to the month-old conflict in the former
Portuguese colony, a diplomat said Tuesday.
	   ``We hope (the fighting) stops so that we can continue'' with
the negotiations, Portugal's Ambassador to the West African country
Fernando Henriques da Silva told Portuguese radio TSF.
	   Portugal and Angola launched a joint mediation effort 10 days
ago when they met delegations from both sides in the capital
Bissau. However, there has been no contact with either faction in
recent days, according to Henriques da Silva.
	   He said that on Tuesday government forces, backed by Senegalese
troops, continued to shell rebel positions around the capital's
airport and a nearby military garrison.
	   He added that for most of Tuesday there had been a muted reponse
from the rebels, made up of a breakaway army faction led by a
former armed forces chief Brig. Ansumane Mane.
	   Mane claims he has the allegiance of most of the country's
6,000-strong army, while neighboring Senegal has deployed at least
1,300 troops to aid President Joao Bernardo Vieira.
	   Portugal's Defense Ministry said the military situation had
changed little since the mutiny began June 7 when Mane demanded
that Vieira step down.
	   ``We get the feeling that the forces are deadlocked. Apparently,
there is no military solution,'' the spokesman said on the
customary condition of anonymity.
	   It has not been possible to ascertain the number of people
killed or wounded in the fighting so far.
	   A separate mediation effort was launched Monday by lawmakers
from Guinea-Bissau's parliament. However, there was no word on
whether they had been able to contact the warring factions.

Russia complains of customs violations by Americans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian Foreign Ministry lodged a complaint
with the U.S. Embassy on Tuesday over what it called attempts by a
diplomat and a group of American archeologists to smuggle
antiquities out of the country.
	   The ministry sent an informal note to the embassy accusing
Philip Hatch, a military attache, of trying to illegally export 44
cultural items when he shipped his household goods from Russia in
June.
	   The note also referred to a group of amateur American
archeologists who were found carrying dozens of medieval coins as
they departed Russia last month.
	   In both cases, Russian officials said the U.S. citizens needed
to have obtained export licenses for the items.
	   ``The Embassy of the United States was urged to strengthen the
necessary educational work among American citizens visiting Russia
with regard to full compliance with Russian laws and rules,''
Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said, according to
the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   ``The note of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian
Federation stressed that actions of this sort by American citizens
are impermissible,'' he said.
	   Olivia Hilton, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy, said they had
received the informal note, and it was being translated.
	   ``We continue to work with the Ministry of Culture and the State
Customs Committee to resolve this issue,'' she said.

Parents suing against German grammar changes withdraw complaint
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEORGE BOEHMER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ In a surprise move, the parents of two
school-age children withdrew their lawsuit against German grammar
changes just one week before the nation's highest court was to rule
on it.
	   Gunda Diercks-Elsner and Thomas Elsner, from the northern city
of Luebeck, had complained that a decision to teach new German
grammar in schools starting Aug. 1 violated their rights on how to
raise their children.
	   Their lawyer Thomas Schueller said his clients withdrew their
complaint after the Munich-based Focus magazine reported Monday
that the Constitutional Court had already decided to reject it.
	   Focus, quoting sources in Bonn, said the court had decided that
the grammar reforms were a reasonable development of German
writing.
	   Despite the parents' withdrawing their complaint, the court
could still rule on the case July 14 as planned, because it has
already discussed it and because of the heated public debate over
the planned grammar changes.
	   The controversy started after culture officials from Europe's
three German-speaking countries, Austria, Germany and Switzerland,
agreed in July 1996 to modernize and simplify the language.
	   Among the changes: shorter compound nouns, consistent spellings,
fewer comma rules _ nine instead of 52, and eliminating the old
German letter for a double ``s,'' which looks like a floppy,
cursive B.
	   While Austria and Switzerland have taken the changes in stride,
many Germans opposed the changes. Prominent German authors and
intellectuals argue that the language of Goethe and Schiller is
good enough for today's children. The Goethe Institute, the
internationally known German language school, has said it would
boycott the new grammar.
	   While the new grammar is to take effect next month, many schools
started teaching it a year early, leading to a series of legal
challenges and contradictory rulings across Germany.
	   Earlier this year, Schleswig-Holstein state agreed to hold a
referendum on the grammar changes on Sept. 27, the same day as the
national election. The parents who had tried to fight the changes
in court now hope their home state will vote the changes down.
	   Schleswig-Holstein's Education Minister Gisela Boehrk, accused
Diercks-Elsner and Elsner of withdrawing their suit because they
did not want the public referendum to be affected by a negative
court decision.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two commuter trains collided at a railway station
outside Moscow on Tuesday morning, killing three people and
injuring several more, officials said.
	   The accident occurred at the Bekasovo railway station 80
kilometers (50 miles) southwest of Moscow when a service car that
had ignored a red light slammed into the back of a commuter train
bound for Moscow.
	   The train's three cars derailed, and a second commuter train
coming in the opposite direction crashed into the derailed cars and
the service car.
	   The driver of the service car and two drivers of the incoming
train died in the crash and six passengers were wounded, railway
officials said in a statement.
	   The heavyweight service car turned several passenger cars into a
heap of broken metal. Some plunged down a slope, landing
window-deep in swampy ground.
	   Casualties were reduced because by chance most passengers were
sitting in cars toward the other end of the train.
	   Officials had to reroute all trains coming through the area.

World Cup: FIFA boss criticizes disciplinary committee for
</HEADLINE>
overlooking hard fouls &QL; 
 &UR; EDS: CORRECTS spelling of Zidane's first name in 5th graf. &QL; 
 &UR; By LARRY SIDDONS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The boss of soccer had harsh words Tuesday for the
panel that hands out player suspensions at the World Cup, saying it
had rejected his suggestion that it use video replays to assess two
hard fouls.
	   FIFA president Sepp Blatter said he had pointed out to the
disciplinary committee that TV tapes would show blatant actions by
Dutch striker Dennis Bergkamp against a Yugoslav defender and by a
Moroccan player against Brazilian superstar Ronaldo.
	   In neither case was a foul called nor later suspensions handed
out by the disciplinary panel, even though Blatter said he thought
such action was justified.
	   ``Sure, I saw it,'' he said when asked if there was video proof
of a suspension-level action by Bergkamp against Sinisa Mihajlovic
in a first-round game.
	   Video replays showed Bergkamp stomping on Mihajlovic as he lay
on the ground. A similar foul drew a two-game suspension for
France's playmaker, Zinedine Zidane.
	   Blatter said he also had seen video tapes showing a blatant foul
by Said Chiba of Morocco, who planted his cleats in the left thigh
of Ronaldo and left deep scratches.
	   ``In two cases, the FIFA president has drawn the presence of
video evidence to their attention,'' Blatter said, referring to the
disciplinary panel. ``They said, `No, it's not needed.' That's OK.
When you have a clean separation of the different powers in a body,
that's their prerogative.''
	   But although he said he didn't order the cases to be reviewed,
Blatter left no doubt he was not happy and would not let the matter
die. He seemed to be particularly upset when it was pointed out
that the referee in the Bergkamp incident, Jose-Manuel Garcia of
Spain, had been picked to handle Wednesday night's France-Croatia
semifinal.
	   ``We'll take up this in assessing the World Cup,'' he said. ``I
will have a word with them _ a very serious word.''
	   Although soccer does not use replays to review on-field
decisions, FIFA does allow the use of tapes to decide the length of
suspensions. The most notable case was in 1994, when an eight-game
ban was imposed on Mauro Tassotti for an elbow to the face of
Spain's Luis Enrique during the quarterfinals, a foul that was
missed by the referee.
	   In 75-minute meeting with reporters, Blatter also said:
	   _A crackdown on tackles from behind had worked to make the game
safer and spotlight an aggressive offense. Although it had led to a
flood of ejections and warnings, Blatter said, the rules were being
applied evenly and accurately. ``The referees have been logical and
at their best,'' he said.
	   Blatter also said that, while dangerous tackling was down,
players had resorted to wrestling-like holds and ``textile
testing'' by pulling shirts of their opponents to drag them out of
position. He said those offenses would be the next targets of
referees.
	   _The World Cup might be too long and could be shortened by a
week in its next edition in 2002. Blatter said the field would
remain at 32 teams, where it was raised this year, but organizers
might shorten gaps between first-round games from six to four days
and play more games per day. He said a decision would be reached
this fall.
	   _Authorities had done all they could to avoid hooliganism and
acted quickly and responsibly when fan violence erupted in
Marseille and Lens early in the tournament. ``We were prepared. The
police in Europe were prepared,'' he said. ``But it is not possible
to avoid violence anywhere at any time.'' Blatter renewed his call
for better coordination among European Union nations to prevent
known troublemakers from crossing their borders.
	   _The first steps in his proposed restructuring of FIFA
management into a larger service team would begin with the first
meeting of the new executive board Thursday. But Blatter said the
issue of what he would be paid as he changes the presidency from
part-time to full-time would not come up. ``If I am working 100
percent of my time for FIFA, it somehow will compensate me,'' he
said. ``But I will not put it on the agenda. That would be a
disgrace to the organization.''

Chemical weapons mastermind fails to appear before truth body
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ The head of the apartheid
government's secret chemical and biological weapons program asked a
court Tuesday to prevent him from testifying before a body probing
human rights abuses.
	   Dr. Wouter Basson says appearing before the Truth And
Reconciliation Commission may prejudice his defense at his criminal
trial, where he will face charges including drug possession and
conspiracy to murder.
	   With the Truth Commission to wind up operations on July 31,
Basson's appeal to the court makes it unlikely Basson will ever be
called to give evidence on some of white-ruled South Africa's
darkest secrets.
	   In sensational hearings last month, scientists working for
Basson described researching a bacteria that would only kill
blacks, plotting to mentally incapacitate President Nelson Mandela
and supplying poisoned food and drink for use by government hit
squads.
	   Dumisa Ntsebeza, head of the commission's investigative unit,
said Basson, who ran the apartheid government's biological and
chemical warfare program through a network of front companies, had
treated the panel with ``the utmost contempt.''
	   The commission is opposing Basson's court action, but Ntsebeza
conceded time was running out to get valuable testimony from him.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Basson's close friend Dr. Philip Mijburgh, who
directed one of the front companies, was questioned by
commissioners on his role in making and supplying the drugs Ecstasy
and Mandrax to the army, which allegedly wanted them for
experiments in riot control.
	   Yasmin Sooka, one of the panelists, suggested large quantities
of the illegal drugs could have ended up in South Africa's
townships where drug use _ and associated gang violence _ remain a
serious problem.
	   Mijburgh testified that he did not know what drugs were being
made.
	   The Truth Commission was set up in 1995, a year after South
Africa's first all-race elections ended apartheid, and is
uncovering abuses committed by all sides in the fight against white
rule.

General Assembly to vote on Palestinian mission

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Palestinians sought Tuesday to upgrade
their U.N. status to that of a virtual state through a General
Assembly vote that was opposed by the United States on the grounds
that it could jeopardize the peace process.
	   Arab states sponsored a resolution that would upgrade the
Palestinian observer mission to a new status of a non-voting member
in the 185-member assembly.
	   American Ambassador Bill Richardson urged member states to vote
against the proposal, saying before the vote: ``This is the wrong
resolution at the wrong time.''
	   ``If this resolution passes, it will undermine our efforts to
get the peace process back on track and hurt everyone's interests,
including those it is most intended to help,'' Richardson told the
assembly.
	   ``Focusing on symbols likely to divide, rather than on steps to
promote cooperation, will lead us nowhere,'' Richardson said.
``Supporting unilateral gestures which will raise suspicion and
mistrust between negotiating partners will not take us closer to
our goal.''

UN preparing to protect operations if Croatia wins World Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Also moving on general news lines. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The U.N. refugee agency said Tuesday it is
preparing to protect its refugee operations in Bosnia against
outbreaks of ethnic violence if Croatia's football team wins the
World Cup.
	   ``We have been doing some contingency planning to safeguard some
of our return projects in areas which might be targeted by people
celebrating an eventual victory,'' said UNHCR spokeswoman Judith
Kumin.
	   A UNHCR water tanker and two buses used to return refugees were
destroyed July 4 in the southern, Croat-held town of Stolac when
Bosnian Croat celebrations of Croatia's 3-0 World Cup victory
against Germany turned violent, Kumin said.
	   Some 200 Bosnian Croats marched through a street where Bosnian
Muslims are rebuilding homes, throwing stones and breaking windows,
Kumin said.
	   Local police were present during the incident but did not
intervene in time to prevent the damage, Kumin said.
	   The Stolac area, located 115 kilometers (70 miles) southwest of
the Bosnian capital Sarajevo, is one of the worst areas of
continued ethnic violence against refugees in Bosnia.
	   So far, only around 400 of some 8,000 refugees who fled the town
during the war between Bosnian Croats and Muslims have been able to
return, Kumin said.
	   Ethnic violence has been orchestrated by Croat hard-liners since
the end of the war in 1995, to prevent Muslim refugees from
reclaiming homes they were forced to leave in 1993.
	   In other parts of the country, Bosnian Serb or Muslim
hard-liners have used similar methods to prevent refugees from
returning.
	   Violence following Croatia's victory also flared in other parts
of Bosnia. In the divided city of Mostar, a 25-year-old Muslim
woman was killed and a man was seriously wounded on the Muslim side
when they were hit by bullets fired in celebration from the Croat
side, Bosnian radio reported.

Volkswagen decides to compensate Nazi-era slave laborers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WOLFSBURG, Germany (AP) _ In a change of heart, Volkswagen
announced Tuesday that it will open a private fund to pay slave
laborers who worked for the company under the Nazis during
1944-1945.
	   VW, Europe's largest automaker, had said last month that the
Nazi regime was responsible for wartime slave labor, and that any
claims should be directed to the regime's successor _ the current
German government.
	   The company explained its new decision to compensate slave
laborers as ``done in recognition of its historical and moral
responsibilities arising from the use of forced labor during World
War II.''
	   Details of the company's planned fund will be released in
mid-September.
	   The announcement comes just weeks after 30 Hungarian Jews forced
to work for VW rejected the company's proposal to establish a
federally administrated compensation fund.
	   The lawyer for the former slave laborers, Klaus von
Mueunchhausen, said June 17 that he was planning to sue VW because
the suggested fund was ``legally unrealistic.'' He said other
companies forced to pay into similar funds have managed to cease
payments.
	   The lawyer has said he is seeking back wages for his clients,
who are now in their 70s. As teen-agers, they were sent from the
Auschwitz death camp in Poland to Volkswagen's factory in Wolfsburg
to build weapons.

Dutch carrier to repurchase common shares from government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with KLM shares closing up 6.9 percent on the
Amsterdam Stock Exchange. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ KLM Royal Dutch Airlines said
Tuesday it will buy back 8.47 million common shares from the Dutch
government, cutting the state's voting stake in the national
carrier from 25 percent to 14 percent.
	   Under the move, the airline also will purchase 4.84 million
participation certificates from the KLM Flight Personnel Pension
Fund Foundation.
	   KLM did not detail terms of the repurchase, which is subject to
the approval of priority shareholders and the board of the pension
fund. The buyback is expected to be completed Aug. 14.
	   The Amsterdam-based carrier said that following the transaction,
the number of common shares will be reduced by 18 percent to 60.7
million common outstanding shares. There are now 68.8 million
outstanding shares.
	   Under the buyback, the government's stake in KLM will drop to
11.8 million preference shares and 1,300 priority shares.
	   The price KLM will pay for the government-held shares will be
determined by the trading value of the shares on the stock exchange
on Aug. 6, 7, 10 and 11, KLM said in a statement.
	   KLM shares surged Tuesday on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange on the
news, closing up 6.9 percent at a record high of 91.40 guilders
(dlrs 44.67).
	   In May, KLM posted a net profit for fiscal 1998 of 2.2 billion
guilders (dlrs 1.1 billion), up from 236 million guilders (dlrs 118
million) in the previous year.
	   KLM said the buyback would boost earnings per share in the
current fiscal year by 15 percent.

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ After two years of trial, a jury here
Tuesday began deliberating the fate of former Premier Silvio
Berlusconi, accused of paying off tax inspectors of his Fininvest
company to obtain lenient audits.
	   A verdict was expected sometime later Tuesday.
	   Prosecutors asked for a three-year prison term for the media
magnate, who is now head of Italy's center-right opposition.
	   Berlusconi has insisted he was being victimized by left-leaning
Milan prosecutors, and the defense argued that the money was
extorted by inspectors auditing his media and retail holding
company.
	   The media empire includes Italy's three largest private TV
networks.
	   Berlusconi was convicted in December of fraud in a 1987 film
company deal and faces other charges of tax evasion and tax fraud.
	   This case grew out of the ``Clean Hands'' corruption probes
begun in Milan in 1992. The kickback probes brought down an entire
political class.

	   With the new designation, Palestinian representatives can raise
issues of the peace process in the assembly, co-sponsor draft
resolutions on Mideast peace and have the right of reply. The
representative can not vote or put forward candidates for U.N.
committees, such as the Security Council.
	   But more important, a vote in favor of the Palestinians would
affirm international support for Palestinians in the protracted
peace process.
	   The resolution notes that Palestinians are full members of the
Arab League, the Group of 77 and other regional organizations and
that ``the Palestinian Authority was established on part of the
occupied Palestinian territory.''
	   Israel's U.N. ambassador, Dore Gold, said this reference
``represents a transparent effort to create a political link
between this resolution and the status of the disputed territories.
	   ``The clear purpose of this effort is to affect the outcome of
the permanent status negotiations over this territory by abusing
the U.N. system,'' he said.
	   The United States has argued against the new designation, saying
any U.N. action on Israel or the Palestinians could jeopardize its
efforts to restart peace talks which have been stalled since March
1997.
	   The Palestine Liberation Organization was granted observer
status in the General Assembly in 1974, enabling it to maintain an
office in New York but without the same privileges as missions of
U.N. member states.
	   The PLO's status was upgraded in 1988 when the General Assembly
decided to designate the PLO as ``Palestine.''
	   In December, the Arab states submitted a resolution to upgrade
the Palestinians' status to that of a non-voting member.

resolution was derailed until Arab states resurrected it last
month.

Police say Angola's former rebels kill 16 in ambush
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Gunmen from the former rebel movement
UNITA ambushed and killed 16 policemen in the remote northeast of
Angola, officials said Tuesday.
	   A police vehicle traveling in Lunda Norte province near
Camaxilo, 500 kilometers (310 miles) northeast of Luanda, on Monday
hit three anti-tank mines, according to the province's deputy
police chief, Vitor Inaculo.
	   The assailants then sprayed the vehicle with machine-gun fire,
killing those who had survived the blasts, Inaculo told reporters.
	   UNITA troops later bombarded Camaxilo with artillery fire, he
said.
	   There was no independent verification of the incident.
	   The government has in recent months said armed men loyal to
UNITA are hiding in rural areas of this vast southwest African
country in contravention of the 1994 peace pact between UNITA and
the government which ended a two-decade civil war.
	   Under the 1994 pact, UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola _ agreed to
hand back to the government the entire 50 percent of the country it
seized during the civil war.
	   The government claims that remnants of UNITA's 70,000-strong
guerilla army are responsible for a string of attacks on remote
villages.
	   Inaculo claimed that there were large-scale UNITA troop
movements in Lunda Norte.
	   A diamond-rich province, Lunda Norte was last year a flashpoint
for renewed clashes between UNITA and government troops which
threatened to undermine the delayed implementation of the United
Nations-brokered peace deal.
	   UNITA maintains mining operations in the region, earning it
millions of dollars each year.
	   The U.N. Security Council last week imposed new sanctions on
UNITA, including a ban on its diamond sales, to force it to comply
fully with the peace agreement.

	   BASTAD, Sweden (AP) _ Sweden's coach Carl-Axel Hageskog Tuesday
named the Davis Cup squad for the upcoming quarterfinal encounter
against Germany in Hamburg July 17-19 and there were no surprises.
	   Hageskog nominated Jonas Bjorkman, Thomas Enqvist, Magnus
Larsson and Nicklas Kulti.
	   Bjorkman and Enqvist are likely to play the singles while
Hageskog is playing Bjorkman and Kulti in the doubles.
	   But Hageskog would not rule out another setup.
	   ``A lot can happen in a week. I`ll wait and see,'' Hageskog
said.
	   '' To play Germany away is always tough,'' said Hageskog who
expects Germany to play Nicklas Kiefer and Tommy Haas in the
singles and Boris Becker and David Prinosil in the doubles.
	   Germany has beaten Sweden in their last three encounters.

Fake NATO general to be handed back to Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romanian police are to hand over a
German man who allegedly embezzled hundreds of marks (dollars) by
posing as a NATO authority, Romanian police said Tuesday.
	   Adrian Conrad, 37, allegedly took some 300,000 German marks
(dlrs 166,000) from 17 Germans between 1996-97, promising them
cheap Mercedes cars from military bases, police said in a report.
	   Conrad was arrested last month, trying to enter Romania near the
northwest city of Satu Mare. He reportedly fled Germany in May
1997.
	   Romanian police are to hand him over to German authorities on
Wednesday at Bucharest's international airport.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The General Assembly voted Tuesday to
upgrade the U.N. status of the Palestinians to that of virtual
statehood, despite opposition from the United States on the grounds
that such a move could jeopardize the peace process.
	   The assembly voted 124 in favor and 4 against the Arab-sponsored
resolution, with 10 abstentions.
	   The United States, Israel, Micronesia and the Marshall Islands
voted against the resolution, which upgrades the Palestinian
observer mission to a new status of a nonvoting member in the
185-member assembly.
	   No nation in the assembly has a veto, unlike those in the
15-member Security Council, meaning the resolution was adopted with

Gang held with 1.5 million Egyptian pounds in fake currency
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Police have arrested a law graduate and five
others who allegedly printed fake Egyptian currency worth 1.55
million Egyptian pounds, a local news agency reported Tuesday.
	   Egypt Middle East News Agency said the gang used sophisticated
computers, which even reproduced the watermark in the high-quality
counterfeits of 20-, 50- and 100-pound notes.
	   MENA did not say when and where the arrests took place.
	   The fake notes _ worth about dlrs 455,882 _ also contained the
fine metallic strip that is inserted into currency notes, and is
often absent in counterfeits, MENA said.
	   The gang leader, Mahmoud Ibrahim Khalil, 30, is a law graduate
and was assisted by five others including two women, MENA said.
	   Forging money, also including the U.S. dollar, is not uncommon
in Egypt.

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romanian police are to hand over a
German man who allegedly embezzled hundreds of marks (dollars) by
posing as a NATO general, Romanian police said Tuesday.
	   Adrian Conrad, 37, allegedly took some 300,000 German marks
(dlrs 166,000) from 17 Germans between 1996-97, promising them
cheap Mercedes cars from military bases, police said in a report.
	   Conrad was arrested last month, trying to enter Romania near the
northwest city of Satu Mare. He reportedly fled Germany in May
1997.
	   Romanian police are to hand him over to German authorities on
Wednesday at Bucharest's international airport.

General strike: trucks, cars block major highway in Puerto Rico

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Blaring their horns, strikers
blocked the main highway to San Juan's international airport with
cars and trucks on Tuesday, the first volley in what threatens to
be Puerto Rico's biggest strike in decades.
	   Riot police who had set up barricades to protect the airport
were taken by surprise by the blockade, which began at dawn.
Protected by a police escort, tourists had to walk 1 1/2 miles to
the airport terminal. Many carried heavy bags and sweated in the
tropical heat.
	   Union leaders expect up to a half million of Puerto Rico's 3.8
million people to join a 48-hour general strike that started
Tuesday. The strike was called to protest the sale of the state
telephone company. Most joining it are government employees,
including utility and health workers.
	   In preparation for the strike, shopkeepers barred windows with
steel shutters, riot police guarded ports and power plants and
residents stocked up on water and batteries.
	   ``You'd think we were preparing for a hurricane,'' one shopper
said, her arms crammed with candles and water bottles.
	   Tuesday's blockade by hundreds of vehicles of the six-lane
Baldorioty de Castro cut off the sole highway to the east of San
Juan, including Luis Munoz Marin International Airport and the
towns of Carolina, Loiza, Rio Grande and the port of Fajardo.
	   American Airlines said it canceled a flight to Miami because
only 59 of its 138 passengers were able to get to the airport.
Arriving passengers were able to leave the airport by another
route.
	   Hundreds of tourists have called off vacations, hotels reported.
At least one airline, Antigua-based LIAT, canceled flights.
	   The strike was called to support 6,400 telephone workers who
stopped working June 18 and are accused of slashing telephone
lines, leaving more than 250,000 islanders without long-distance
service.
	   Riot police, firefighters and civil defense workers were on
alert. Last week, a bomb hidden in a flashlight exploded in a
policeman's hands, blowing off a finger.
	   Protesters have made telephone bomb threats and planted hoax
bombs, prompting major shopping malls to announce they would close
during the strike.
	   The telephone company sale is part of the most ambitious plan
yet from Gov. Pedro Rossello, who has sold state hospitals,
prisons, ports and hotels.
	   The leaders of the biggest unions, which belong to government
workers, see their power waning and accuse Rossello of ``selling
the patrimony of the people.''
	   Rossello last week signed a law completing the dlrs 1.9 billion
sale to a consortium led by U.S. communications giant GTE Corp. and
the local Banco Popular. It awaits federal approval.

Rand recovers after record lows
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ After posting a series of
record lows against the U.S. dollar, the South African currency
made a dramatic recovery Tuesday, regaining 64 South African cents
on Monday's all-time low.
	   Foreign speculators evidently decided to take profits from their
onslaught on the rand by selling dollars back to the market,
dealers said.
	   By the close of business in Johannesburg, the rand strengthened
to 6.12 against the U.S. currency, from 6.44 at Monday's close.
	   The naming of a political heavyweight as the first black central
bank governor jerked the rand to 6.76 to the dollar _ its weakest
ever _ earlier on Monday.
	   The appointment of Labor Minister Tito Mboweni, 39, to replace
veteran Reserve Bank governor Chris Stals next year shook jittery
markets and prompted a sharp burst of activity by speculators,
dealers said.
	   But concerns over the independence of the central bank under
Mboweni, once seen as a militant in the inner circle of President
Nelson Mandela's governing African National Congress, were
countered by assurances he will resign immediately from his ruling
party posts and understudy Stals for a year before taking over in
August 1999.
	   Mboweni made headlines as a member of the ANC's department of
economic planning before Mandela came to power in 1994 by calling
for a wealth tax mainly on South Africa's whites for national
reconstruction after decades of apartheid.
	   But at the Labor Ministry he has shown pragmatism and fairness
in drafting labor reforms, business leaders say.
	   The rand dropped in similar circumstances in 1966 when veteran
financier Chris Liebenberg was replaced as finance minister by ANC
militant Trevor Manuel.
	   The rand has been under pressure because of the global emerging
market crisis sparked by Asia's financial woes. As the rand became
vulnerable, it came under assault by currency speculators.
	   So far this year it has lost about 20 percent of its value
against the U.S. currency.

France protests Belarus tearing down wall of ambassador's residence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The French Foreign Ministry on Tuesday accused
Belarus of violating international law by tearing down the fence
surrounding the French ambassador's residence.
	   ``We express our deepest protests regarding this new measure by
the Belarusian authorities,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves
Doutriaux told a regular news briefing.
	   Doutriaux said the act of pulling down the fence constituted a
``grave and flagrant violation'' of the Vienna Convention that
governs diplomatic relations among nations.
	   The State Department reacted in a similar manner Monday, saying
authorities in Belarus had removed fences protecting the residence
of the U.S. ambassador there and dispatched a government worker
onto the grounds of the compound.
	   The Belarusian Foreign Ministry and the country's diplomatic
administrative office declined to comment Tuesday on either
incident.
	   The actions represent the escalation of a diplomatic conflict
over sewer repairs and demands by Belarus that ambassadors in the
area vacate their homes so that work could begin.
	   A number of ambassadors, including U.S. ambassador Daniel
Speckhard, left the country two weeks ago.
	   Doutriaux said France was demanding that the Belarusian
authorities put the wall back up again and give French officials
free access to the ambassador's residence.

Ukrainian parliament elects former Communist as speaker

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ In a challenge to President Leonid Kuchma,
Ukraine's parliament elected a former Communist Party official and
Soviet-era agrarian minister as its new speaker on Tuesday.
	   The 232-37 vote followed Verkhovna Rada's repeated failures to
choose a speaker since the new legislature was elected in late
March. The largely leftist Rada has held about 20 unsuccessful
rounds of voting since it first convened in mid-May.
	   The election of Oleksandr Tkachenko, 59, was a disappointment
for Kuchma, who had hoped for a more moderate candidate following
his repeated clashes with the previous parliament and its Socialist
speaker Oleksandr Moroz.
	   Kuchma has accused parliament of stalling economic reforms in
his former Soviet republic of more than 50 million people. And he
has warned the new parliament that it must cooperate with the
government because of Ukraine's gloomy economic situation.
	   Tkachenko, however, is viewed as even more radical than Moroz,
and his election put in question the adoption of urgent economic
steps such as budget cuts.
	   It also might influence foreign investors, who already are wary
of the country's unstable economy, and creditors such as the
International Monetary Fund. Ukraine has attracted only dlrs 2
billion in direct foreign investment since independence in 1991 and
is desperate for loans from abroad.
	   Tkachenko, speaking after his election, said the government
should work out a ``long-awaited real program of action'' to combat
Ukraine's economic crisis together with parliament.
	   Tkachenko worked as a village agronomist before rising through
Communist Party ranks and various agricultural institutions in
then-Soviet Ukraine. He was the republic's agriculture and food
minister before the Soviet collapse in 1991 and agriculture
minister for a brief period in 1992.
	   Tkachenko also ran for president in 1991, but withdrew his
candidacy in favor of Leonid Kravchuk, who won the election. He
later formed the Land and People agrarian association and served as
Moroz's first deputy in the old parliament. In the new Rada,
Tkachenko is a member of the 34-seat Leftist Center faction.
	   The 450-member Rada's previous attempts to elect a speaker were
thwarted by political infighting, prompting Kuchma, the president,
to blame parliament for failing to address the country's pressing
economic and social problems.
	   Last month, Kuchma began issuing economic decrees to boost
production and ease the tax pressure on small businessmen. But
parliament under Tkachenko might move to derail the president's
initiatives.
	   After his election, Tkachenko called on Kuchma to work together
with parliament so as ``to avoid any contradictions'' between his
decrees and Ukraine's constitution.
	   Tkachenko could become Kuchma's rival in the next presidential
election, scheduled for October 1999, since the speakership is
widely seen as an effective presidential launching pad.

Nurse charged after newborn dies in Toronto hospital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ A 24-year-old nurse has been charged with
second-degree murder in the suffocation of a newborn boy at a
Toronto-area hospital.
	   Gita Proudman, who has worked in Humber River Regional
Hospital's maternity unit for the past two years, was charged after
an autopsy found Mustafa Dehzad was killed by asphyxiation, police
said Monday.
	   The infant was born June 10 with severe physical abnormalities
and died less than two days later.
	   The autopsy indicated the cause of death was ``consistent with
an obstruction of the nose and mouth,'' said Sgt. Marilyn McCann.
	   Proudman was not assigned to the care of the child at the time
of his death, McCann said.
	   The hospital president, Darlene Barnes, said the coroner's
office was notified within a few hours of the death because of
``suspicious circumstances.'' The matter was then turned over to
police, who investigated and laid the charges.
	   Proudman has not been on duty since June 12, the hospital said.
	   The boy was the first child of Mohammad and Ashtila Dehzad,
natives of Afghanistan in their early 20s.

Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   Scattered showers developed over the east coastal waters of
Puerto Rico overnight as a weak low level trough moved across the
island. Some of these showers moved onshore over east Puerto Rico
and produced periods of heavy rain. Doppler radar estimated more
than an inch of rain fell over Vieques. Most other area received up
to a half inch.
	   The surface trough moved west of Puerto Rico this morning
allowing surface and middle level winds to turn slightly southeast.
The local atmosphere remains unstable.
	   Showers and thunderstorms are expected across the interior, west
and northwest portions of Puerto Rico this afternoon. Most of these
will weaken and dissipate before sunset.
	   The tropical wave over the Lesser Antilles this morning will
continue to move toward Puerto Rico today. Much of the moisture
associated with this wave will be drawn north by an upper level low
north of the Leeward Islands. However, the wave is drawing
additional moisture up from South America which may bring another
round of showers and thunderstorms to Puerto Rico and the U.S.
Virgin Islands Wednesday and Thursday.
	   Small craft in the surrounding coastal waters should exercise
caution due to trade winds of up to 20 knots. These winds may
increase as the tropical wave moves in.

Sweden's coach pulls no surprises, names team against Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASTAD, Sweden (AP) _ Sweden's coach Carl-Axel Hageskog Tuesday
named the Davis Cup squad for the quarterfinal encounter July 17-19
against Germany in Hamburg with no surprises.
	   Hageskog nominated Jonas Bjorkman, Thomas Enqvist, Magnus
Larsson and Nicklas Kulti.
	   Bjorkman and Enqvist are likely to play the singles while
Hageskog is playing Bjorkman and Kulti in the doubles.
	   But Hageskog would not rule out another lineup.
	   ``A lot can happen in a week. I`ll wait and see,'' Hageskog
said.
	   ``To play Germany away is always tough,'' said Hageskog who
expects his team to meet Germans Nicklas Kiefer and Tommy Haas in
the singles and Boris Becker and David Prinosil in the doubles.
	   Germany has beaten Sweden in their last three encounters.

Feuding Albanian politicians blame US and Europeans for divisions;
</HEADLINE>
say peace talks still distant &QL; 
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Stung by criticism of divisions in
their ranks, Kosovo's Albanian politicians Tuesday blamed their
failure to unite on a lack of U.S. and European resolve.
	   Special U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke has expressed frustration
that the 16 Kosovo Albanian political parties have so far failed to
rally behind moderate Ibrahim Rugova as their leader in future
talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan on the future of Kosovo.
	   Such talks are considered crucial in resolving the conflict
peacefully and preventing it from spreading elsewhere in the
Balkans. Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in the province, which is
part of Serbia.
	   Serbia along with Montenegro forms what remains of Yugoslavia.
	   But Rugova's senior adviser, Alush Gashi, blamed lack of a
coherent strategy by the Contact Group -- the United States,
Russia, France, Britain, Italy and Germany -- for widening
divisions in ethnic Albanian ranks.
	   ``The international community blames their failures to bring
peace on natural divisions in Albanian politics,'' Gashi said.
``The Contact Group keeps demanding the Serbs withdraw their
forces, but they are ignored. Without a doubt, the biggest problem
for us is that there's no international agenda.''
	   Senior officials of the Contact Group meet Wednesday in Bonn,
Germany, to review the situation in Kosovo, where hundreds have
died since violence escalated in late February.
	   With the extremist Kosovo Liberation Army stepping up attacks
against local Serbs, the six governments are expected to back down
from demands made last month for an immediate withdrawal of Serb
military forces from Kosovo.
	   Instead, the six governments are expected to call for an
immediate ceasefire to be monitored by international observers.
	   That is unlikely to set well with ethnic Albanians, including
those allied with Rugova. Gashi said the world's inability to force
Milosevic to withdraw Serb security forces had produced a
stalemate.
	   Continuing violence, he said, turns Albanian farmers and
villagers into guerrillas and widens divisions among Kosovo
Albanian politicians, some of whom consider violence as a
legitimate reaction to what they consider Serb oppression.
	   ``The KLA is an army that grew out of the people of Kosovo and
is a consequence of Serbia's years-long repression,'' Hajrulah
Gorani, head of a Kosovo Albanian labor union, said Tuesday during
a visit to Bosnia.
	   On the other hand, Milosevic would risk a backlash among his own
people if he left Serb civilians defenseless against armed Albanian
extremists.
	   The United States, Russia and other European powers oppose the
KLA's goal of independence for Kosovo and instead want
``substantial autonomy'' for the province.
	   Rugova also supports independence. Nevertheless, major powers
have pinned their hopes on him because he has disavowed violence.
	   But stepped-up attacks by the KLA, as well as a lack of
diplomatic progress in halting the Serb crackdown, have undercut
Rugova's standing within the Albanian community.
	   ``I told the Americans that there will be no Albanian political
unity until Mr. Rugova leaves politics for good,'' said Adem
Demaci, the second-most influential Kosovo Albanian politician.
``If Mr. Rugova leaves, the KLA can come in and we will have the
essentials for a serious negotiation.''
	   Both Milosevic and the Russians refuse to include the KLA in
negotiations, considering it a terrorist organization. U.S.
officials have met with KLA members to urge them to accept Rugova
-- which they have so far refused.
	   Before leaving Belgrade on Monday, Holbrooke said Kosovo
Albanian politicians ``don't have a fully structured, legitimate
political structure and they, therefore, make conflicting claims.''
	   ``That has resulted in a very, very openly factious situation in
Pristina,'' he said.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police battling ethnic Albanian
insurgents in a village near one of Kosovo's largest cities forced
them to retreat, Serb sources reported Tuesday.
	   The pro-government Serb Media Center said that the Kosovo
Liberation Army retreated from Lodja village overnight in the
region near the southwestern city of Pec.
	   With phone lines cut and the main road to the region sealed off
by Serb police for security reasons, there were few details on the
situation Tuesday, but ethnic Albanian sources said shooting
persisted in and around the village on Tuesday.
	   The fighting flared Monday, with the ethnic-Albanian-run Kosovo
Information Center reporting one person killed and three wounded by
heavy shelling of Lodja village, near Pec.
	   Serb sources said armed Albanians opened fire on Serb villagers,
forcing a Serb counter-attack.
	   The Serb Media Center reported two policemen killed and nine
others wounded in the fighting at Lodja. The Media Center said that
11 civilians and two policemen were evacuated overnight from Lodja,
and large quantities of weapons were collected after KLA forces
left them behind.
	   In neighboring Albania, the interior ministry reported a weekend
incursion of about 20 soldiers of the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army.
The group took up combat positions for about an hour Sunday before
returning to home territory, said the ministry.
	   There was no official comment from Yugoslavia.
	   Militant ethnic Albanians fighting for independence for Kosovo
province from the southern Yugoslav republic of Serbia have been
regrouping and arming themselves inside the Albanian border for
months.
	   Tensions were high in the 3,000-member community of Pirane, 75
kilometers (45 miles) southwest of the provincial capital,
following the burials of three ethnic Albanian farmers.
	   Official Serb reports said the three were murdered by their own
people for betraying them. But the villagers say the slayings are
the handiwork of Serb police.
	   The contradictory allegations highlight the constant conflicting
propaganda in Serbia's disputed Kosovo province, where ethnic
Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1. Western diplomats hope to bring
some clarity to the confusion with the launch this week of a
multi-national observer mission.
	   Since Serb forces launched a crackdown on ethnic Albanian
militants on Feb. 28, a tangle of roadblocks have prevented any
outside observers from confirming reports of fighting. Information
is largely channeled through centers representing either side.
	   In a separate report, the Media Center said that KLA fighters
released two Serbs kidnapped several days ago and handed them over
to the International Red Cross. And both Serb and Albanian sources
reported that the body of an ethnic Albanian apparently killed as
part of the ethnic feuding was found close to Orahovac, about 40
kilometers (25 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo. Recent attempts
to bring ethnic Albanian leaders and the Yugoslav government to the
negotiating table have produced few results.

Russian markets fall more amid talks with IMF
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS and UPDATES throughout market closing, ruble
drops, government bonds dive again, BP will not compete for stake
in Rosneft. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN IAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian government bonds took a nosedive Tuesday
and the stock markets continued to sink while officials pressed
ahead with appeals to the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank for new loans.
	   Interest rates on short-term government bonds shot up to 120
percent, from 90 percent on Monday, as the Central Bank failed to
intervene to bring down the soaring yields.
	   The stock market dropped 4.5 percent, despite assurances that
the government was getting closer to a bailout agreement with the
IMF. The ruble closed slightly lower against the U.S. dollar.
	   Anatoly Chubais, Russia's representative to international
lenders, met with officials of the IMF and the World Bank for two
hours. He said afterward the parties would meet again Thursday to
settle outstanding issues.
	   Russia is seeking a loan of at least dlrs 10 billion from the
IMF and other international lenders to stabilize its markets.
	   ``We wanted to resolve all principal issues in a tight time
frame, by the end of the week, and spend the next week on working
out practical problems,'' he said, according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   Chubais said Tuesday's talks were complicated.
	   ``There is understanding for Russia's tough position, but one
can't just lose heart, and the actions of the government must
stimulate growth,'' Chubais said.
	   Martin Gilman, the IMF's chief representative in Moscow, said
additional aid to Russia will depend on the government's
destabilization package, which is being considered by parliament,
ITAR-Tass said.
	   Michael Carter, the World Bank's Moscow representative, said
Russian can only lay the groundwork for economic growth through
structural reforms.
	   If the government's economic program becomes bogged down in the
State Duma, parliament's lower house, President Boris Yeltsin may
sign many of bills into law in the form of decrees.
	   Russian markets have been deeply troubled in in recent months
due to the government's shaky finances, a drop in world oil prices
and the spillover from the Asian economic crisis.
	   The stock market has lost more than half its value this year and
the interest rates on government bonds have soared to unsustainable
levels.
	   But so far the problems have been limited to the markets and
have had little effect on ordinary Russians. The government's
greatest fear is that the currency will fall, which would increase
prices and directly affect consumers.
	   Meanwhile, one of the largest planned privatization schemes in
Russian history was all but scuttled Tuesday when British Petroleum
said it would not compete for a 75 percent stake in the
state-controlled oil company Rosneft.
	   The BP pullout followed a decision last week by U.K. Royal Dutch
Shell not to compete in the bidding.
	   The government is mulling over a postponement of the sale until
the end of the year, the ITAR-Tass news agency said, citing
industry sources. The government expects world financial markets
and oil prices to recover by then, the news agency said.

US rights activist: Turkey must respect press
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ After visiting a prominent Turkish
journalist imprisoned last month, a leader of the Committee to
Protect Journalists said Tuesday that Turkey cannot call itself a
democracy if it continues to jail journalists.
	   ``There is only one thing that separates a democracy from every
other form of government, and that's a free press,'' said Kati
Marton, of the New York-based press freedom watchdog.
	   Marton, also representing Human Rights Watch on her four-day
visit, met with Ragip Duran, correspondent of the French daily
Liberation who is serving a seven-month sentence for separatist
propaganda.
	   In a 1994 article in a now defunct pro-Kurdish daily, Duran said
Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party,
had acquired the ``identity of a philosopher and moralist, besides
his military and political ones.''
	   ``We like to think (Turkey) is a member of the Western family of
democracies, a multi-party state and a great friend of the United
States,'' she said, contending that the arrest of Duran hurt Turkey
more than anything else.
	   Marton was to hold talks with foreign ministry officials before
leaving Turkey Wednesday.
	   Turkish laws prohibit journalists from covering certain issues
in ways unfavorable to the government.
	   There are 29 journalists in prison in Turkey, according to the
Committee to Protect Journalists.

Police give car to prisoner holding hostages with grenade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Police gave a getaway car Tuesday to a
prisoner who pulled a grenade from his pocket during a court
hearing and took two hostages.
	   Jose Eduardo Hernandez Martinez, who is on trial for murder, had
been holding the hostages for 15 hours when police agreed to his
demand for a car.
	   Both hostages are employees of the court in Amatitlan, 12 miles
(20 kms) south of the capital, where Hernandez was on trial for
murder Monday.
	   Early Tuesday, Hernandez took a third hostage _ police
psychologist Jannett Rios, who was trying to persuade him to give
up _ but she escaped as officers gave Hernandez a bag of candy and
a soda.
	   Hernandez, 25, is charged with killing Heidy Esmeralpa
Castellanos Chajon in December 1997 at a bar.

Shelling continues in Guinea-Bissau; mediation efforts stymied
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Fighting in recent days between rebels
and government forces in the capital of Guinea-Bissau is thwarting
efforts to end a month-old conflict in the former Portuguese
colony, a diplomat said Tuesday.
	   ``We hope (the fighting) stops so that we can continue'' with
the negotiations, Portugal's Ambassador to the West African country
Fernando Henriques da Silva told Portuguese radio TSF.
	   Portugal and Angola launched a joint mediation effort 10 days
ago when they met both sides in the capital, Bissau. However, there
has been no contact with either faction in recent days, according
to Henriques da Silva.
	   He said that on Tuesday government forces, backed by Senegalese
troops, continued to shell rebel positions around the capital's
airport and a nearby military garrison.
	   He added that for most of Tuesday there had been a muted reponse
from the rebels, made up of a breakaway army faction led by a
former armed forces chief, Brig. Ansumane Mane.
	   Mane claims he has the allegiance of most of the country's
6,000-strong army, while neighboring Senegal has deployed at least
1,300 troops to aid President Joao Bernardo Vieira.
	   Portugal's Defense Ministry said the military situation had
changed little since the mutiny began June 7 when Mane demanded
that Vieira step down.
	   ``We get the feeling that the forces are deadlocked. Apparently,
there is no military solution,'' the spokesman said on condition of
anonymity.
	   It has not been possible to ascertain the number of people
killed or wounded in the fighting so far.
	   A separate mediation effort was launched Monday by lawmakers
from Guinea-Bissau's parliament. However, there was no word on
whether they had been able to contact the warring factions.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ The U.N. refugee agency said Tuesday it is
preparing to protect its refugee return operations in Bosnia
against outbreaks of ethnic violence if Croatia's football team
wins the World Cup.
	   ``We have been doing some contingency planning to safeguard some
of our return projects in areas which might be targeted by people
celebrating an eventual victory,'' said UNHCR spokeswoman Judith
Kumin.
	   A UNHCR water tanker and two buses used to return refugees were
destroyed in the southern, Croat-held town of Stolac on July 4 as

Ukraine's Supreme Court clears former presidential bodyguard
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The military board of Ukraine's Supreme
Court upheld a ``not guilty'' verdict Tuesday for an
ex-presidential bodyguard who was accused of corruption.
	   Col. Viktor Palivoda, who headed the personal bodyguard unit
under former President Leonid Kravchuk and held a variety of other
top security posts, was detained in Budapest, Hungary, in 1994 and
extradited to Ukraine.
	   Palivoda was charged with stealing nearly dlrs 70,000 in
government-owned communication equipment, the Interfax news agency
reported. However, three trials failed to prove his guilt and a
military court finally pronounced him not guilty in January this
year.
	   The prosecutor-general's office had appealed the decision.

Dutch carrier to repurchase common shares from government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with KLM shares closing up 6.9 percent on the
Amsterdam Stock Exchange. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ KLM Royal Dutch Airlines said
Tuesday it will buy back 8.47 million common shares from the Dutch
government, cutting the state's voting stake in the national
carrier from 25 percent to 14 percent.
	   Under the move, the airline also will purchase 4.84 million
participation certificates from the KLM Flight Personnel Pension
Fund Foundation.
	   KLM did not detail terms of the repurchase, which is subject to
the approval of priority shareholders and the board of the pension
fund. The buyback is expected to be completed Aug. 14.
	   The Amsterdam-based carrier said that following the transaction,
the number of common shares will be reduced by 18 percent to 60.7
million common outstanding shares. There are now 68.8 million
outstanding shares.
	   Under the buyback, the government's stake in KLM will drop to
11.8 million preference shares and 1,300 priority shares.
	   The price KLM will pay for the government-held shares will be
determined by the trading value of the shares on the stock exchange
on Aug. 6, 7, 10 and 11, KLM said in a statement.
	   KLM shares surged Tuesday on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange on the
news, closing up 6.9 percent at a record high of 91.40 guilders
(dlrs 44.67).
	   In May, KLM posted a net profit for fiscal 1998 of 2.2 billion
guilders (dlrs 1.1 billion), up from 236 million guilders (dlrs 118
million) in the previous year.
	   KLM said the buyback would boost earnings per share in the
current fiscal year by 15 percent.

Ukrainian government approves Motor-Sich privatization conditions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's government has approved the
conditions for privatization of the huge Motor-Sich aviation
engines producer, a news agency said Tuesday.
	   The state would retain a package of 25 percent of shares plus
one share for a period of five years, the Cabinet decided,
according to the Interfax news agency. At present, more than 70
percent of Motor-Sich shares belong to the workers and about 26
percent to Ukraine's State Property Fund.
	   The company in the southeastern Zaporizhya region has 30,000
workers and is a leading aviation engines producer in the former
Soviet Union, capable of making up to 5,000 engines a year,
Interfax noted.
	   Motor-Sich has concluded contracts with 84 nations and is
implementing large-scale contracts with South Korea, Brazil, China
and several African states this year, the report said.
	   Separately, the government decided to keep for three years 25
percent of shares in three regional energy companies, including
Kievoblenergo which serves locations around the Ukrainian capital.
	   Earlier, similar conditions were approved for six other regional
energy companies.

Chrysler inaugurates new plant in Brazil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ American automaker Chrysler Corp. on
Tuesday inaugurated its new dlrs 315 million pickup truck plant in
the southern Brazilian state of Parana.
	   The new factory, near the state capital of Curitiba, 350
kilometers (220 miles) southwest of Sao Paulo, will produce Dodge
Dakotas. Its initial production capacity of 12,000 units a year
could eventually be expanded to 40,000 units.
	   By the end of this year, 5,000 vehicles are expected to roll off
the new plant's assembly line, located in the town of Campo Largo.
	   It is Chrysler's third plant in South America, where it also
operates in Argentina and Venezuela, and the first one to make
Dodge Dakotas outside the United States.
	   ``The inauguration of this plant is an extremely important part
of our strategy for Brazil and for the rest of Mercosur (the
customs union that also includes Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay)''
said Chrysler's chairman Robert Eaton. `It is also concrete proof
of the company's long term commitment to the country's
development.''
	   Besides Brazil, the new plant's output will also be sold in
other South American countries, mainly Argentina and Chile, the
company said in a statement.
	   Because it is the only Chrysler plant producing a diesel version
of the Dodge Dakota, Asia and Europe could also become future
markets.
	   Chrysler is also building, together with Germany's BMW, a dlrs
500 million engine plant in Campo Largo.
	   The joint venture will produce 1.6-liter and 1.4 liter engines,
all of which will be exported. Roughly half of the engines will be
shipped to England where they will be used by BMW's Rover group.
The other half will be go to the United States where they will be
used in small cars made by Chrysler.
	   The new engine plant is expected to begin production in the year
2000 with an annual capacity of 400,000 units.

Greek Cypriots say they are ready for direct talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Responding to a call by the U.N. Security
Council, the Cyprus government said Tuesday it is prepared to
resume direct talks with Turkish Cypriots to settle a dispute that
has left this Mediterranean island divided since 1974.
	   Foreign Minister Yiannakis Cassoulides told reporters that
President Glafcos Clerides ``is ready to return to the negotiating
table even tomorrow.'' But he hinted that the Turkish Cypriot
leader, Rauf Denktash, may not be so amenable.
	   ``It takes two to tango,'' he said.
	   Clerides, a Greek Cypriot whose government is the island's only
internationally recognized administration, held two rounds of
inconclusive talks with Denktash last year on the reunification of
the island.
	   The talks deadlocked when Denktash demanded recognition for his
self-styled Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in the northern
third of Cyprus, which is controlled by Turkish troops.
	   Denktash also wants the Clerides government to withdraw its bid
to join the European Union.
	   Cyprus has been unofficially partitioned since Turkey invaded
the island in 1974 following a short-lived coup in Nicosia by
supporters of union with Greece. Denktash declared the new northern
state in 1983.
	   The Cyprus problem has been at the center of the traditional
rivalry between NATO members and neighbors, Turkey and Greece.
	   On Monday, the U.N. Security Council urged the Turkish and Greek
Cypriots to resume direct negotiations. The call came after the
council heard a report by U.N. envoy to Cyprus, Diego Cordovez, who
met Clerides and Denktash separately in Cyprus last week.
	   Cordovez told reporters in Nicosia Saturday that he made
progress in his efforts to reach a new formula for negotiations
acceptable to both sides. He did not elaborate, but said he planned
to return to Cyprus in September.
	   Contributing substantially to the tension, the Clerides
government says it will go ahead and deploy Russian anti-aircraft
missiles later this year despite Turkish threats to prevent their
arrival by military means if necessary.

 &UR; Volkswagen decides to compensate Nazi-era slave laborers &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: ADDS background, details, byline &QL; 
 &UR; By GEORGE BOEHMER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ In a change of heart, Volkswagen
announced Tuesday that it will open a private fund to pay slave
laborers who worked for the company under the Nazis during
1944-1945.
	   VW, Europe's largest automaker, had said last month that the
Nazi regime was responsible for wartime slave labor, and that any
claims should be directed to the regime's successor _ the current
German government.
	   The Wolfsburg-based company explained its new decision as ``done
in recognition of its historical and moral responsibilities arising
from the use of forced labor during World War II.''
	   Details of the planned fund will be released in mid-September.
	   The announcement comes just weeks after 30 Hungarian Jews forced
to work for Volkswagen rejected the company's proposal to establish
a federally administrated compensation fund.
	   The lawyer for the former slave laborers, Klaus von
Muenchhausen, said June 17 that he was planning to sue VW because
the suggested fund was ``legally unrealistic.'' He said other
companies forced to pay into similar funds have managed to cease
payments.
	   The lawyer is seeking back wages for his clients, who are now in
their 70s. As teen-agers, they were sent from the Auschwitz death
camp in Poland to Volkswagen's main factory in Wolfsburg to build
weapons.
	   VW said it was not negotiating with Muenchhausen.
	   About 7 million slave laborers were forced to work in Nazi
Germany during the war. The German government has compensated Nazi
slave laborers for imprisonment and health damage, but has refused
to honor wage claims because laborers technically were working for
private companies.
	   German companies have largely avoided payments to forced
laborers. But the Diehl defense contracting company said in May it
would compensate surviving Jewish women. The women were taken from
a concentration camp at Grossposen, in what is now Poland, and
forced to work in two Diehl factories building munitions during the
war.

World Cup: Les Bleus feel whole nation is starting to back team
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ Even in this isolated training
camp the message is rustling through the old oak trees. Steadily,
surely the whole of France is rallying behind Les Bleus in the
final week of the World Cup.
	   From the lukewarm reaction early on in the tournament to the
honking horns, traffic jams, champagne sprays and pandemonium on
the Champs Elysees after the quarterfinal win over Italy last
Friday, France is catching World Cup fever. Even in small villages,
people are talking about France's chances with a new fervor.
	   ``They've really changed. The people are a lot more for the team
now,'' said painter Jose Jean-Philippe, who works in the tiny
village of Senlisse close to the training camp, 40 kilometers (25
miles) outside Paris.
	   Jean-Philippe devoured a big plate of spaghetti last Friday in
honor of the triumph over Italy. He hasn't decided yet what he'll
feast on if France beats Croatia in Wednesday's semifinal because
he's unsure of Croatia's specialty. ``I'll eat something,'' he
said.
	   In the capital where blase is chic, fresh winds of soccer
excitement are blowing along the boulevards.
	   ``The best thing isn't that the French have got into the
semifinals,'' said Laurent Samama, a 27-year-old Parisian. ``It's
that French people are smiling at each other in the streets.''
	   In that Mediterranean soccer hotbed Marseille, Les Bleus are the
toast of the town and many are succumbing to the spell.
	   Roland Fritolli of the ``Peron'' restaurant is adding a new
essential to his 72-year-old establishment.
	   ``I brought in a television set for the first time. I've never
done this before. But after all, it's La France,'' he said.
	   And behind the gates of the French training camp, beyond the
thick greenery that screens off the team and players, the good
vibrations are welcomed.
	   ``The scenes have given me goose bumps,'' said French captain
Didier Deschamps. ``We saw their fervor.''
	   ``We showed the French we had a great French team,'' said coach
Aime Jacquet. The scenes of a suddenly soccer-mad capital draped in
blue did much more than any newspaper article could to bolster
morale.
	   For Jacquet, the French are feasting in spite of the press. He
has long claimed there was a media campaign against him, instituted
by the widely read L'Equipe newspaper, and every victory is a bit
more of sweet revenge.
	   ``The public was surprised because it was disinformed,'' Jacquet
said Tuesday. ``They wanted to make the public believe there was no
French team, there was no tactical plan, that there even wasn't a
coach.''
	   The players have complained too. ``It didn't go down well,''
said captain Didier Deschamps, adding ``a rift was created''
between the team and the public that is only now starting to heal.
	   An advertisement in L'Equipe suggested the changing mood.
	   Satirizing a public opinion survey, the Adidas ad said: ``35
percent of the French don't care one bit about the World Cup, 30
percent ... 24 percent ... 12 percent ... .''
	   Jean-Philippe, the painter who helped renovate the French
training quarters here two years ago, remembers Jacquet as a much

he said.

Les Bleus feel whole nation is starting to back team

	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ Even in this isolated training
camp the message is rustling through the old oak trees. Steadily,
surely the whole of France is rallying behind Les Bleus in the
final week of the World Cup.
	   From the lukewarm reaction early on in the tournament to the
honking horns, traffic jams, champagne sprays and pandemonium on
the Champs Elysees after the quarterfinal win over Italy last
Friday, France is catching World Cup fever. Even in small villages,
people are talking about France's chances with a new fervor.
	   ``They've really changed. The people are a lot more for the team
now,'' said painter Jose Jean-Philippe, who works in the tiny
village of Senlisse close to the training camp, 40 kilometers (25
miles) outside Paris.
	   Jean-Philippe devoured a big plate of spaghetti last Friday in
honor of the triumph over Italy. He hasn't decided yet what he'll
feast on if France beats Croatia in Wednesday's semifinal because
he's unsure of Croatia's specialty. ``I'll eat something,'' he
said.
	   In the capital where blase is chic, fresh winds of soccer
excitement are blowing along the boulevards.
	   ``The best thing isn't that the French have got into the
semifinals,'' said Laurent Samama, a 27-year-old Parisian. ``It's
that French people are smiling at each other in the streets.''
	   In that Mediterranean soccer hotbed Marseille, Les Bleus are the
toast of the town and many are succumbing to the spell.
	   Roland Fritolli of the ``Peron'' restaurant is adding a new
essential to his 72-year-old establishment.
	   ``I brought in a television set for the first time. I've never
done this before. But after all, it's La France,'' he said.
	   And behind the gates of the French training camp, beyond the
thick greenery that screens off the team and players, the good
vibrations are welcomed.
	   ``The scenes have given me goose bumps,'' said French captain
Didier Deschamps. ``We saw their fervor.''
	   ``We showed the French we had a great French team,'' said coach
Aime Jacquet. The scenes of a suddenly soccer-mad capital draped in
blue did much more than any newspaper article could to bolster
morale.
	   For Jacquet, the French are feasting in spite of the press. He
has long claimed there was a media campaign against him, instituted
by the widely read L'Equipe newspaper, and every victory is a bit
more of sweet revenge.
	   ``The public was surprised because it was disinformed,'' Jacquet
said Tuesday. ``They wanted to make the public believe there was no
French team, there was no tactical plan, that there even wasn't a
coach.''
	   The players have complained too. ``It didn't go down well,''
said captain Didier Deschamps, adding ``a rift was created''
between the team and the public that is only now starting to heal.
	   An advertisement in L'Equipe suggested the changing mood.
	   Satirizing a public opinion survey, the Adidas ad said: ``35
percent of the French don't care one bit about the World Cup, 30
percent ... 24 percent ... 12 percent ... .''
	   Jean-Philippe, the painter who helped renovate the French
training quarters here two years ago, remembers Jacquet as a much
more pleasant man than some media made him out to be. Now he feels
the public is turning to the coach's side.
	   ``You see the attitude among the people towards Jacquet has
changed,'' said Jean-Philippe.
	   While French are hardly the diehard fans of Italy or Brazil,
there are concerns that the public might give the whole Coupe du
Monde a Gallic shrug of indifference if the team loses Wednesday.
	   But if France gets to the final, Jean-Philippe can only think
about the great student demonstration of 30 years ago when the
capital was total chaos.
	   ``It will be like May '68. Everybody will be in the streets,''
he said.

First phase of Siamese twin separation in Argentina successful
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MENDOZA, Argentina (AP) _ Siamese twins born last week in
Argentina are recovering well after the first of several operations
to separate them.
	   Doctors say the separation of Ana Belen and Laura Noelia could
take four operations.
	   One doctor, Humberto Cavagnaro, told a Buenos Aires newspaper
the situation looks promising since the babies do not share vital
organs or bone structure.
	   The twins should be separated in about 40 days, doctors said,
although they will need a further operation to repair the area that
connects them.

UN ugrades Palestinian status over US objections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with context of new status; background of other
observers; minor edits. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The General Assembly voted Tuesday to
upgrade the U.N. status of the Palestinians to that of virtual
statehood, despite opposition from the United States on the grounds
that such a move could jeopardize the peace process.
	   The assembly voted 124 in favor and 4 against the Arab-sponsored
resolution, which upgrades the Palestinian observer mission to a
unique status of a nonvoting member in the 185-member assembly. Ten
members abstained.
	   ``A small victory was achieved for Palestine today, and we thank
you all for that,'' said the Palestinian representative, Nasser
al-Kidwa, after the vote. He said he hoped the Palestinians would
be made full members, with voting power, in the near future. ``That
shall be a big victory.''
	   No other entity has the nonvoting member status, and the move
was a blow to the United States, Israel's closes ally at the United
Nations, which had tried to keep the Palestinians as obervers. The
United States, Israel, Micronesia and the Marshall Islands voted
against the resolution.
	   No nation in the assembly has a veto, unlike the five permanent
members of the Security Council, meaning the resolution was adopted
with the majority vote.
	   Bill Richardson, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, urged
member states to vote against the proposal, saying before the vote:
``This is the wrong resolution at the wrong time.''
	   ``If this resolution passes, it will undermine our efforts to
get the peace process back on track and hurt everyone's interests,
including those it most intended to help,'' Richardson told the
assembly.
	   ``Focusing on symbols likely to divide, rather than on steps to
promote cooperation, will lead us nowhere,'' Richardson said.
``Supporting unilateral gestures which will raise suspicion and
mistrust between negotiating partners will not take us closer to
our goal.''
	   With the new designation, Palestinian representatives can raise
issues of the peace process in the assembly, cosponsor draft
resolutions on Mideast peace, and reply on record to speeches made
at the world body. The representative cannot vote or put forward
candidates for U.N. committees, such as the Security Council.
	   More important, the vote affirms international support for
Palestinians in the protracted Mideast peace process.
	   The resolution notes that Palestinians are full members of the
Arab League, the Group of 77 and other regional organizations and
that ``the Palestinian Authority was established on part of the
occupied Palestinian territory.''
	   Israel's U.N. ambassador, Dore Gold, said this reference
``represents a transparent effort to create a political link
between this resolution and the status of the disputed territories.
	   ``The clear purpose of this effort is to affect the outcome of
the permanent status negotiations over this territory by abusing
the U.N. system,'' he said.
	   The United States has argued against the new designation, saying
any U.N. action on Israel or the Palestinians could jeopardize its
efforts to restart peace talks which have been stalled since March
1997.
	   The Palestine Liberation Organization was granted observer
status in the General Assembly in 1974, enabling it to maintain an
office in New York but without the same privileges as missions of
U.N. member states.
	   Other observers are Switzerland, the Holy See and international
organizations such as the European Community.
	   The Palestinian Liberation Organization's status was upgraded in
1988 when the General Assembly decided to designate the PLO as
``Palestine.''
	   In December, the Arab states submitted a resolution to upgrade
the Palestinians' status to that of a nonvoting member.
	   Israel and the United States strongly opposed the move and the
resolution was derailed until Arab states resurrected it last
month.

<SLUG> Italian company buys gasket plan, saving 160 jobs,0224 </SLUG>


<TEXT>
	   FORT SMITH, Arkansas (AP) _ An Italian manufacturer has
purchased a pair of gasket plants in Fort Smith and Evansville,
Indiana, saving jobs for 228 people the plants' previous owner
intended to lay off.
	   ILPEA Inc. said Monday it had purchased the plants from
Fairlawn, Ohio-based GenCorp, which had announced in April that it
would close the refrigerator gasket plants.
	   The Fort Smith operation had 163 employees and the Evansville
plant 65.
	   Bob Gale, the newly appointed plant manager of the Fort Smith
facility, said a unit here that made vehicle seals would be
transferred to GenCorp's plant at Wabash, Indiana, next week.
Workers on those lines would be absorbed into other areas here, he
said.
	   ``I think this is very positive for Fort Smith and our work
force,'' Gale said. ``We won't be losing any positions, and
hopefully we'll be able to expand sometime in the near future.''
	   Luca Dovera, controller of the Malegesso, Italy-based ILPEA,
said his company is the world's largest producer of magnetic
gaskets for refrigerators and other appliances, with dlrs 200
million in annual sales.
	   ILPEA has 10 plants in Europe.
	   Whirlpool Corp., which operates a plant in Fort Smith, is the
Fort Smith plant's largest customer.

Canadian senator gets fine, probation for influence-peddling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Michel Cogger, a member of Canada's Senate since
1986, was fined Monday, placed on probation and ordered to perform
120 hours of community service following his conviction for
influence-peddling.
	   Quebec Court Judge Robert Sansfacon imposed a dlrs 3,000 (dlrs
2,100 U.S.) fine and placed the senator on probation for a year.
	   Cogger, 59, was convicted of lobbying the government for a
private client for two years after he was appointed to the Senate
in May 1986 by then-Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
	   The offense carries a maximum penalty of five years in jail.
	   Cogger's lawyer, Marc Cigana, said there had been no decision
about a possible appeal. Asked whether Cogger now must give up his
Senate seat, Cigana said: ``Others will have to decide.''
	   According to testimony, businessman Guy Montpetit paid Cogger
dlrs 212,000 (about dlrs 150,000 U.S.) in an unsuccessful bid to
obtain a multimillion-dollar government subsidy.
	   Montpetit, 59, was convicted May 1 of buying Cogger's influence.
He received a suspended sentence and was ordered to do 240 hours of
community work.

Monet blockbuster show set for Boston and London
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ An exhibition of paintings by Claude Monet, the
father of impressionism, is being predicted to break attendance
records in Boston and London.
	   Museums and collectors around the world have loaned organizers
about 80 of Monet's paintings. They include views of London, Venice
and his garden at Giverny in France, concluding with the immense
canvases of water lilies when he was moving to a near-abstract
style.
	   ``This will be the most comprehensive show yet of the works of
Monet's last 26 years, the least understood period of his career,''
Malcolm Rogers, director of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, said
Tuesday.
	   ``Monet in the 20th Century'' will be at the Boston museum Sept.
20-Dec. 27 and at London's Royal Academy of Arts from Jan. 23-April
18, 1999.
	   Sir Ernest Dowson, president of the Royal Academy, said the show
could break the academy's record attendance of 658,000, which also
was for a Monet exhibition, in 1990.
	   Claude Monet painted from 1899 until his death in 1926 at age
86.
	   It was the Boston Museum of Fine Arts that in 1927 held the
first and most important commemoration of his work. Rogers said its
collection of 48 Monet paintings is the largest in any museum
outside France.

	   The jury had begun deliberation earlier in the day on the
accusation that Berlusconi paid off tax inspectors to obtain
favorable audits of his Fininvest media and retail holding company.
	   Prosecutors had asked for a three-year prison term for the media
magnate, who has insisted he was being victimized by left-leaning
Milan prosecutors.
	   The defense argued that the money was extorted by inspectors
auditing his media and retail holding company.
	   The media empire includes Italy's three largest private TV
networks.
	   Berlusconi was convicted in December of fraud in a 1987 film
company deal and faces other charges of tax evasion and tax fraud.
	   This case grew out of the ``Clean Hands'' corruption probes
begun in Milan in 1992. The kickback probes brought down an entire
political class.

No Africans, Asians in 38 chosen by experts

	   PARIS (AP) _ Reflecting their disastrous performances at the
World Cup, no African or Asian players made it to the 38-strong
``second selection'' of the All-Star Team of World Cup '98,
announced Tuesday by MasterCard, one of the sponsors.
	   The three Africans included among the 61 orginal ``finalists''
announced during the quarterfinal stage, Nigeria's Sunday Oliseh
and Jay-Jay Okocha and Morocco's Moustafa El Hadji, were dropped
when it was trimmed to 38 before the semifinals.
	   So was Japan's Hidetoshi Nakata. Japan and Morocco were
eliminated in the first round along with South Korea, Saudi Arabia,
South Africa, Cameroon, Morocco and Tunisia and Nigeria was ousted
in round-of-16, beaten 4-1 by Denmark.
	   By the time the quarterfinals arrived, the World Cup was down to
two South American teams and six from Europe.
	   The only player among the 37 that is not from Europe or South
America was Mexican forward Luis Hernandez.
	   As expected, semifinalists Brazil, Netherlands, France and
Croatia has the most players in the squad.
	   The six Brazilians, who faced the Dutch Tuesday in Marseille,
were defenders Cafu, Junior Baiano and Roberto Carlos, midfielders
Dunga and Rivaldo and striker Ronaldo.
	   The six Dutch players were goalkeeper Edwin Van der Sar, Frank
de Boer and his twin brother Ronald, Phillip Cocu, Dennis Bergkamp
and Marc Overmars.
	   Five French players, goalkeeper Fabien Barthez, defenders Marcel
Desailly and Lilian Thuram, and forwards Thierry Henry and Zinedine
Zidane, made it to the 37 and the four Croats were defenders Dario
Simic and Robert Jarni, midfielder Aljosa Asanovic and striker
Davor Suker.
	   FIFA's technical study group _ an 11 member panel headed by Jurg
Nepfer, head of the world body's technical department _ will pare
the list to 16 following the semifinals and announce the team July
10, two days before the final.
	   MasterCard will donate dlrs 50,000 to FIFA's official charity,
SOS Children's Villages, on behalf of the players selected.

Rights group protests Kenyan's appointment to UN team to Algeria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The Kenya Human Rights Commission on
Tuesday protested the appointment of Attorney General Amos Wako to
a United Nations team investigating violence in Algeria.
	   In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the private
organization said Wako was unfit for the mission because he has
``failed to investigate and deal with violence within Kenya itself.
''
	   ``Since the political violence erupted, there has been no
prosecution of the people incriminated in that violence,'' the
commission said.
	   More than 1,500 people have died in sporadic and politically
motivated ethnic violence that erupted in late 1991. Hundreds of
thousands of people were forced to flee their homes and small
farms.
	   Wako, who is Kenya's public prosecutor, could not be reached for
comment. He served on a similar U.N. mission to the former
Portuguese territory of East Timor, which was forcibly occupied and
annexed by Indonesia in 1975.
	   The commission said it was willing to recommend ``many other
eminent Kenyans who could serve in this role.''
	   Other members of the team are from Portugal, France, India,
Jordan and the United States.
	   Since 1992 when the government annulled parliamentary elections
Muslim parties appeared poised to win, an estimated 75,000 people
have died in Algeria, victims of violent acts linked both to Muslim
fundamentalists and to the state security forces.

Polish gays to hold their first festival
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Polish gays announced Tuesday that they
will hold their first public festival but said they still dare not
hold a parade in this predominately Roman Catholic country.
	   The festival, to be held Friday and Saturday in Warsaw's Old
Town square, will inaugurate the gay community's new ``Rainbow''
counseling center.
	   Poland's gay monthly magazine ``New Man,'' a partial sponsor of
the festival, will hold a dance. An exhibit of works by American
gay photographers is also planned.
	   But there will be no flamboyant parade of floats and marchers,
such as the Annual Gay and Lesbian Pride March in New York City,
which passes through the gay mecca of Christopher Street, or the
``Christopher Street Day'' parades held recently in Germany.
	   ``The approach of Polish society to homosexuals is so
unfavorable that organizing a parade would risk unpleasant
incidents,'' Krzysztof Garwatowski, of ``New Man,'' told the news
agency PAP.
	   Discrimination against homosexuals in Poland is widespread and
accepted.
	   The Solidarity-led government has strong links to the Catholic
Church, which traditionally opposes homosexuality. About 95 percent
of the population of 39 million is Roman Catholic.
	   The minister in charge of family policy, Kazimierz Kapera,
publicly denounced homosexuals as deviants in 1990 during his term
as deputy health minister.

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ A court here Tuesday convicted Silvio
Berlusconi, the media mogul and former premier, of bribing tax
inspectors and sentenced him to two years and nine months in
prison, the Italian news agency ANSA reported.
	   The verdict came after more than two years of trial for
Berlusconi, who is currently leader of Italy's center-right
opposition and who insists he is a victim of a vendetta by
left-leaning Milan prosecutors.
	   In Italy, prison sentences are rarely begun unless the
conviction is upheld by two appeal courts.
	   It was the second guilty verdict for Berlusconi, who was
convicted in December of fraud in a 1987 film company deal and
given a 16-month suspended sentence.
	   ``I just spoke with my client Silvio Berlusconi, who told me
that this is a political verdict that expresses an orientation of
regime and that there is no justice for him in Milan,'' said the
ex-premier's lawyer, Ennio Amodio.
	   Berlusconi exercised his right not to attend trial session.
	   The jury had begun deliberations earlier in the day on the
accusation that Berlusconi paid off tax inspectors to obtain
favorable audits of his Fininvest media and retail holding company.
	   The defense argued that the money was extorted by inspectors
auditing his media and retail holding company.
	   Prosecutors had asked for conviction and a three-year prison
term for the media magnate and conviction and a two-year-four month
term for the ex-premier's brother, Paolo Berlusconi, who was a
company official.
	   The court acquitted Paolo Berlusconi.
	   The ex-premier faces charges of tax evasion and tax fraud in
other cases.
	   The Berlusconi media empire includes Italy's three largest
private TV networks.
	   This case grew out of the ``Clean Hands'' corruption probes
begun in Milan in 1992. The kickback probes brought down an entire
political class.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A U.N. tribunal prosecuting war
crimes in the former Yugoslavia said Tuesday it won't hesitate to
bring charges against Kosovo's warring parties if evidence of
atrocities emerges.
	   In a stern message to leaders of the so-called Contact Group
nations meeting Wednesday in Bonn, Germany, Yugoslav war crimes
tribunal chief prosecutor Louise Arbour reaffirmed her authority to
file charges related to the deteriorating situation in the troubled
Serbian province.
	   ``The prosecutor believes that the nature and scale of the
fighting indicate that an `armed conflict,' within the meaning of
international law, exists in Kosovo,'' the U.N. court said in a
statement.
	   ``As a result, she intends to bring charges for crimes against
humanity or war crimes if evidence of such crimes is established,''
it said.
	   The U.N. court was set up in 1993 by the Security Council to
bring to justice those who carried out atrocities during the
conflicts in the former Yugoslavia.
	   But Arbour, of Canada, has traveled to Kosovo on a fact-finding
mission to investigate reports of possible atrocities in Kosovo,
where ethnic Albanians fighting for an independent province
outnumber Serbs 9-to-1. Hundreds of people have been killed.
	   ``The tribunal's jurisdiction also includes crimes committed by
persons on either side of the conflict,'' the tribunal statement
said. ``International law imposes obligations on combatants
involved in an armed conflict to observe the laws of war.''
	   The court said it would hold not only perpetrators criminally
responsible, but also their superiors who failed to take actions to
prevent or stop war crimes.
	   Critics of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in the U.S.
Congress have said he should be indicted for crimes against
humanity for his crackdowns on ethnic Albanians.
	   New York-based Human Rights Watch has accused both sides of war
crimes and human rights violations.
	   It claims to have ``powerful evidence'' that Serb police
``summarily executed'' an unspecified number of ethnic Albanians
between February and May. It has also faulted the Kosovo Liberation
Army for ``detentions and attacks on Serbian civilians.''

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ As Europe has grown closer politically and
economically, the idea of one big stock exchange often has been
floated _ but this time it might actually fly.
	   The two biggest markets, long-time rivals London and Frankfurt,
embarked Tuesday on a bold joint venture that their bosses predict
will lure others into a big blue-chip exchange for all of Europe,
listing around 300 major shares.
	   London Stock Exchange chairman John Kemp-Welch proclaimed it
``the first step along the road to a single European market,'' but
analysts cautioned that creating a market second only to the New
York Stock Exchange won't necessarily be an easy step.
	   It remains to be seen how other European markets will respond to
the move, which some may view as a threat to their own profitable
turfs.
	   The Societe des Bourses Francaises, which runs the French stock
markets, said it favors a European exchange. But the French alluded
to previous intense London-Frankfurt competition by saying such a
market might already exist had it not been for ``the reluctance of
the English and German exchanges to get further involved.''
	   The Swiss Exchange views the London-Frankfurt venture as a
rival, and said it was far too early to predict whether the Swiss
might want to join up.
	   Before getting others aboard, the London and Frankfurt exchanges
first must get their own act together. They need to agree on one
set of operating rules _ and whether those rules would sound more
English or more German remains unclear.
	   They intend first to find ways for their markets to offer the
same price for top London and Frankfurt shares, no matter where
they are bought and sold, then ultimately to use the same
electronic trading system for blue-chip dealings.
	   The Anglo-German market could for a while be a case of one
exchange, two currencies.
	   The Frankfurt stocks will be priced in Europe's new single
currency, the euro, after its launch on Jan. 4, while London shares
initially will be priced in pounds sterling.
	   Britain has not yet decided whether to scrap the pound in favor
of the euro, but London Stock Exchange chief executive Gavin Casey
hinted in a news conference that the London market might not wait.
	   ``We'll start in sterling but move to the euro when a majority
of our users want to,'' Casey said. Even if Britain stays out of
the euro, he added.
	   Previous ideas about forming a European exchange may have
sounded seductive to Europeans who note the EU economy is bigger
than that of the United States. But the prospect of uniting a bunch
of smallish, fragmented markets full of regional rivalries has
always proven overly daunting.
	   ``The real acid test is going to come with different regulatory
environments,'' said George Hodgson, an equity strategist at ABN
AMRO Hoare Govett in London.
	   But markets in Europe are inevitably drawing closer, he said.
	   ``European investment is becoming just that _ European
investment, rather than a bunch of local decisions by local fund
managers,'' Hodgson said.
	   Asked about the traditional rivalry between London, Europe's top
stock market, and Frankfurt, which ranks a distant second, Deutsche
Boerse chief executive Werner G. Seifert said the deal was ``not a
marriage in heaven ... but a solid partnership on Earth.''
	   The exchange leaders acknowledged it could take a long time, if
ever, before they can hope to outdo the New York Stock Exchange, by
far the world's biggest.
	   ``That's clearly a long-term vision,'' Casey said.

Cyprus Airways' largest union rejects reform plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HAMZA HENDAWI &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Cyprus Airways' largest trade union
Tuesday rejected the management's reform plan that included a
3-year wage freeze in a bid to pull the national carrier out of the
red.
	   CYNIKA, which represents 1,500 of the airline's 1,800 employees,
said the plan is ``catastrophic.'' Its rejection could possibly
lead to strikes and other industrial protests if negotiations with
the management do not produce a compromise.
	   In a separate statement, the airline's powerful pilots' union
said it was prepared to negotiate to ``find painless ways for the
company to save money.''
	   The five-year plan, presented to the unions Tuesday, aims to
reduce costs by 10 percent and enforce a three-year wage freeze
starting in 1999. In return the company is offering the staff a
share option scheme and a share in profits.
	   If implemented the plan would raise the airline's annual
revenues by 22 million pounds (dlrs 41.58 million) to 162 million
pounds (dlrs 306.1 million) by 2001.
	   ``These are the least painful cost-cutting measures ever
proposed to workers by a company,'' Cyprus Airways chairman Takis
Kyriakides told Parliament's finance committee on Monday.
	   The airline has suffered in recent months because of
highly-publicized work-to-rule protests by pilots, persistent
reports of corruption and nepotism and losses of about 5 million
pounds (dlrs 9.35 million) in 1996 and 3.18 million pounds (dlrs
5.94 million) in 1997.
	   The airline's performance could have a ripple effect on the
tourism industry, the country's largest employer worth about dlrs 2
billion annually and accounting for about 20 percent of the
island's economy.
	   About 2 million foreigners visit Cyprus every year, and Cyprus
Airways and its sister charter company ferry about 30 percent of
them.
	   Kyriakides said the airline is planning to increase flights on
its lucrative Athens and London routes by the year 2000 and reduce
fares to stay competitive as low-budget airlines are expected to
start operating as part of the liberalization of the aviation
industry.
	   Cyprus Airways is about 80 percent owned by the government. The
remaining 20 percent stocks are traded on the Cyprus Stock
Exchange. In keeping with laws, the government is required to
reduce its stake by March 1999 and the government is looking for a
buyer to reduce its share to 51 percent.

Fidel Castro to visit Jamaica
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Cuban President Fidel Castro is
expected to visit Jamaica this year, a government spokesman
announced Tuesday.
	   A Jamaican foreign ministry spokesman said no date had been set
for Castro's visit, but he said he expected it to be in the next
months, around the same time the Cuban leader would visit Barbados.
Castro already is scheduled to visit the Dominican Republic and
Grenada in the next couple of months.
	   There have been unconfirmed reports that Castro plans a trip to
Barbados _ possibly to commemorate the 1976 crash of a Cubana
Airlines jetliner off Barbados that killed 73 people.
	   Jamaican Prime Minister P.J. Patterson visited Cuba last year,
when several other island leaders made first-time visits in a
Caribbean initiative to improve relations and boost trade with
Havana.

Mickey's last stand: Disney parade characters go on strike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Available
 &UR; By JOCELYN NOVECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MARNE-LA-VALLEE, France (AP) _ Snow White and Captain Hook were
singing at the gates of Disneyland Paris Tuesday. It was a familiar
tune, but the words were slightly different.
	   ``It's a small pay after all,'' they sang, in English and
French.
	   In a confluence of two French passions _ Disney characters and a
good strike _ Mickey, Minnie and a few friends have walked off the
job.
	   The two-week-old strike by parade performers has been largely
good-natured; some strikers wear colorful masks, and almost all
wear smiles.
	   And whether you believe the strikers' count (80 performers off
the job) or management's count (only 40 out of 160), it doesn't
appear to have greatly affected the huge theme park outside Paris.
	   But the two-week-old strike has an uncomfortable undercurrent:
the clash of a profitable American-style company with the
comfortable welfare-state benefits that French workers treasure.
	   On Tuesday, a few dozen strikers, all in their 20s and 30s,
gathered in a morning drizzle to hear a pep talk from a union
leader, describing the benefits that theme park performers are
supposed to get under French law.
	   The main issue is, of course, is money.
	   But the performers also want to be reclassified, to what
translates as ``artists'' rather than ``extras.'' That would not
only raise their pay but give them a more prestigious status.
	   ``I am not just an extra when I play Captain Hook,'' said Adrian
Stemmer, 26. ``I need to greet children as my character. They come
up to me and say, for example, that they hate Peter Pan, too. I
need to think about how Hook would respond.''
	   Stemmer said he grosses around 7,000 francs a month (roughly
dlrs 1,200) and would make at least another 2,000 francs (about
dlrs 330) if his status were upgraded. And some extra respect.
	   ``If I were an extra, I could just stand around in my costume
and smoke a cigarette. It's insulting.''
	   Euro Disney, which runs the park, doesn't quite agree.
	   ``At a newspaper, does every worker deserve to be
editor-in-chief?'' asks company spokesman Isabelle Clap.
	   Clap said Euro Disney has proposed that performers audition for
the category of artist. The strikers find that offensive. They say
the company is flatly violating a 1996 French law governing the
status of theme park workers.
	   Clap responds that Disneyland Paris workers have it better than
at other theme parks in France, where work is only seasonal.
``Here, they have permanent contracts, much better benefits, and an
extra month's bonus,'' she says.
	   For now, the standoff is complete. Though Euro Disney settled a
walkout by 15 technicians on Monday, no new talks are scheduled
with the parade performers.
	   ``Management knows where to find us,'' says one strike leader,
Giovanni Savoia, who plays a 1920s-style director in the daily
parade down Main Street U.S.A.
	   For the company's part, Clap says, ``They know our door is
always open.''
	   Meanwhile, the parade goes on every day at 3:30 p.m., with a few
less performers.
	   On Tuesday, there were 10 floats; management says that is
normal, but strikers say that's paltry. Plus, they say, some
dancers are missing.
	   But Minnie and Mickey were there, and so was Belle from Beauty
and the Beast, Sleeping Beauty, and Cinderella. Little girls with
big Mickey ears and pink-and-white polka dot bows watched
contentedly from their sidewalk perches.
	   Julie Hladin had brought her two kids from Perth, Australia, for
a five-day stay. Her son Nicolas, 6, gave the parade a quick
verdict: ``Good!''
	   ``Oh yes,'' his mother said, ``they said on the TV news in
Australia that Mickey's on strike. But we haven't really noticed.''

Zeman to form center-left minority government

 &UR; Eds: LEADS with Zeman saying further talks with Christian Democrats
and Freedom Union unlikely, agreement on Klaus' support to his
minority government ready

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) - Social Democratic leader Milos
Zeman said Tuesday that further coalition talks with two small
center-right parties seem to be over and indicated he will rely on
support from former Premier Vaclav Klaus to his minority Cabinet
instead.
	   After talks with Klaus Tuesday, Zeman said the two leaders were
preparing an agreement under which Klaus' Civic Democratic Party
could support his government.
	   ``I hope that tomorrow we will ... inform you what is the
standpoint of the our parties' leadership on this document,'' Zeman
told Czech radio.
	   ``We trust that this proposal means possible solution ... and
could lead to the so needed long-term political stability,'' said
Klaus.
	   None of the leaders gave any details on the agreement.
Previously the two said they had ruled out working together.
	   Zeman's Social Democrats won the June early elections, but
captured only 74 seats in the 200-member parliament _ too few to
form a government.
	   The Social Democrats lack any center-left allies, and Zeman's
efforts to form a coalition with the Christian Democrats who hold
20 seats and the Freedom Union who hold 19 seats have failed.
	   ``At the moment, it is very difficult to think that the talks
... could continue,'' Zeman said.
	   His indications last week that he may seek Klaus' support for
his minority Cabinet scared the two smaller parties, who now fear
they could loose their say in further coalition talks.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Klaus, the election runner-up with 63 seats,
refused an offer by the Freedom Union and the Christian Democrats
to support his Cabinet, should his Civic Democratic Party be asked
to form one. Both parties have ruled out a possible coalition with
Klaus.
	   ``The Civic Democratic Party does not believe in such a
solution,'' Klaus told Czech radio after meeting of his party's
leadership Tuesday. ``Such a government would not guarantee a
long-term stability in the country.''
	   He also indicated his party does not consider the two small
parties trustworthy.
	   ``The experience ... makes us convinced that by forming such a
(minority) government, the Civic Democratic Party would fall
hostage to the Freedom Union and the Christian Democrats, and the
mandate of such a government would be ... very limited,'' Klaus
told the radio.
	   The Christian Democrats were members of Klaus' former
three-party coalition, but left it late last year, causing the
Cabinet to collapse. The Freedom Union was later formed by rebels
from the Civic Democratic Party who disagreed with Klaus.
	   On Thursday, Zeman is scheduled to inform President Vaclav Havel
on progress made.

Afghan man awaits deportation ruling from Canada
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMILTON, Ontario (AP) _ A member of Afghanistan's former
Marxist government is hoping that support from a former U.S.
president and some Canadian politicians will help him avoid
deportation from Canada.
	   Mohamad Karimzada, 53, was a senior official for the Afghan
government in power from 1978 to 1992 when the mujahedeen,
Western-backed Islamic insurgents, took over the capital.
	   Karimzada held different posts in Afghanistan's Ministry of
External Affairs including ambassador to Czechoslovakia. He and his
family fled to the capital, Kabul, when his brother-in-law and
cousin were killed after the takeover.
	   Canadian immigration granted refugee status to Karimzada, his
wife, and two children in 1993. In February 1996, the government
ordered Karimzada, but not his family, deported. The decision was
based on a 1994 law denying residence to members of the pre-1992
government, which grossly violated human rights.
	   Despite losing an appeal against his deportation order,
Karimzada still hopes Immigration Minister Lucienne Robillard, who
has the power to change the decision, will allow him to stay.
	   ``It's a better chance (now),'' Karimzada said.
	   Karimzada has the support of former U.S. president Jimmy Carter,
who telephoned Robillard and wrote Prime Minister Jean Chretien
urging them to let him stay.
	   He also has the support of politicians like Hamilton Mayor Bob
Morrow.
	   Karimzada maintains his innocence that he had no role in or
knowledge of the atrocities committed by his government.
	   ``I was a diplomat, not a policy maker, not a decision maker,''
Karimzada said.

Ex-premier convicted in bribery case
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with statement from Berlusconi himself; ADDS verdicts
for other defendants &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ A court here Tuesday convicted Silvio
Berlusconi, the media mogul and former premier, of bribing tax
inspectors and sentenced him to two years and nine months in
prison.
	   The verdict came after more than two years of trial for
Berlusconi, who is currently leader of Italy's center-right
opposition and who insists he is a victim of a vendetta by
left-leaning Milan prosecutors.
	   In Italy, prison sentences are rarely begun unless the
conviction is upheld by two appeal courts, a process which can take
several years.
	   It was the second guilty verdict for Berlusconi, who was
convicted in December of fraud in a 1987 film company deal and
given a 16-month suspended sentence.
	   ``When you use the weapon of political trials to eliminate the
democratic opposition, you're not in a democracy any more, you're
in a regime,'' Berlusconi, who skipped the trial session, said in a
faxed statement.
	   The jury had begun deliberations earlier in the day on the
accusation that Berlusconi paid off tax inspectors to obtain
favorable audits of his Fininvest media and retail holding company.
	   The defense argued that the money was extorted by inspectors
auditing his media and retail holding company.
	   Prosecutors had asked for conviction and a three-year prison
term for the media magnate and conviction and a two-year-four month
term for the ex-premier's brother, Paolo Berlusconi, who was a
company official.
	   The court acquitted Paolo Berlusconi as well an inspector, who
belongs to Italy's paramilitary tax police. Also convicted and
sentenced to jail terms ranging from 10 months to 2 1-2 years were
three Fininvest officials or consultants. Three tax police
officials were also convicted and sentenced to terms ranging from
two to three years.
	   The ex-premier faces charges of tax evasion and tax fraud in
other cases.
	   The Berlusconi media empire includes Italy's three largest
private TV networks.
	   This case grew out of the ``Clean Hands'' corruption probes
begun in Milan in 1992. The kickback probes brought down an entire
political class.

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Authorities arrested a Romanian man
Tuesday and issued a warrant for an Iraqi man after some dlrs
120,000 worth of smuggled cigarettes were discovered in a Black Sea

Feuding Albanian politicians blame US, Europe for divisions; say
</HEADLINE>
peace talks distant &QL; 
 &UR; WITH Yugoslavia-Kosovo
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Stung by criticism of divisions in
their ranks, Kosovo's Albanian politicians Tuesday blamed their
failure to unite on the United States and Europe.
	   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke said he is frustrated that the 16
Kosovo Albanian political parties have failed to accept Ibrahim
Rugova as their leader for future talks with Yugoslav President
Slobodan on the future of Kosovo.
	   Such talks are considered crucial in resolving the conflict
peacefully and preventing it from spreading elsewhere in the
Balkans. Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in the province, which is
part of Serbia.
	   Serbia and Montenegro forms what remains of Yugoslavia.
	   But Rugova's senior adviser, Alush Gashi, blamed lack of a
coherent strategy by the Contact Group -- the United States,
Russia, France, Britain, Italy and Germany -- for widening
divisions in ethnic Albanian ranks.
	   ``The international community blames their failures to bring
peace on natural divisions in Albanian politics,'' Gashi said.
``The Contact Group keeps demanding the Serbs withdraw their
forces, but they are ignored. Without a doubt, the biggest problem
for us is that there's no international agenda.''
	   Senior officials of the Contact Group are scheduled to meet
Wednesday in Bonn, Germany, to review the situation in Kosovo,
where hundreds have died since violence escalated in late February.
	   With the Kosovo Liberation Army's increased attacks against
Serbs, the six governments are expected to drop demands made last
month for an immediate withdrawal of Serb military forces from
Kosovo.
	   Instead, the six governments are expected to call for an
immediate ceasefire to be monitored by international observers.
	   That is unlikely to be welcomed by ethnic Albanians, including
those allied with Rugova. Gashi said the world's inability to force
Milosevic to withdraw Serb security forces had produced a
stalemate.
	   Continuing violence, he said, turns Albanian farmers and
villagers into guerrillas and widens divisions among Kosovo
Albanian politicians, some of whom consider violence a legitimate
reaction to what they consider Serb oppression.
	   ``The KLA is an army that grew out of the people of Kosovo and
is a consequence of Serbia's years-long repression,'' Hajrulah
Gorani, head of a Kosovo Albanian labor union, said Tuesday during
a visit to Bosnia.
	   On the other hand, Milosevic would risk a backlash among his own
people if he left Serb civilians defenseless against armed Albanian
fighters.
	   The United States, Russia and other European powers oppose the
KLA's goal of independence for Kosovo and instead want
``substantial autonomy'' for the province.
	   Both Milosevic and the Russians refuse to include the KLA in
negotiations, considering it a terrorist organization. U.S.
officials have met with KLA members to urge them to accept Rugova
-- which they have so far refused.
	   Before leaving Belgrade on Monday, Holbrooke said Kosovo
Albanian politicians ``don't have a fully structured, legitimate
political structure and they, therefore, make conflicting claims.''
	   ``That has resulted in a very, very openly factious situation in
Pristina,'' he said.

UN upgrades Palestinian status over US objections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reaction from Netanyahu, Arafat senior aide &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The General Assembly voted Tuesday to
upgrade the U.N. status of the Palestinians to that of virtual
statehood, despite opposition from the United States on the grounds
that such a move could jeopardize the peace process.
	   The assembly voted 124 in favor and 4 against the Arab-sponsored
resolution, which upgrades the Palestinian observer mission to a
unique status of a nonvoting member in the 185-member assembly. Ten
members abstained.
	   Nabil Abourdeineh, senior aide to Palestinian Authority leader
Yasser Arafat, said the vote meant there was a global consensus in
support of the Palestinian cause and people.
	   ``It is an admission of their legitimate rights and it
constitutes support for the peace process,'' he told The Associated
Press. ``It is a huge step toward the imminent declaration of
statehood.''
	   No other entity has the nonvoting member status, and the move
was a blow to the United States, Israel's closes ally at the United
Nations.
	   Washington had argued against the new designation, saying any
U.N. action on Israel or the Palestinians could jeopardize its
efforts to restart peace talks which have been stalled since March
1997.
	   ``This is the wrong resolution at the wrong time,'' U.S.
Ambassador Bill Richardson told the assembly before the vote. ``It
will undermine our efforts to get the peace process back on track
and hurt everyone's interests, including those it most intended to
help.''
	   ``Focusing on symbols likely to divide, rather than on steps to
promote cooperation, will lead us nowhere,'' he said. ``Supporting
unilateral gestures which will raise suspicion and mistrust between
negotiating partners will not take us closer to our goal.''
	   The United States, Israel, Micronesia and the Marshall Islands
voted against the resolution.
	   No nation in the assembly has a veto, unlike the five permanent
members of the Security Council, meaning the resolution was adopted
with the majority vote.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected the decision
as ``minor correction to their current status,'' but said the
effort by the Palestinians violated previous peace agreements.
	   ``I am concerned with the actual attempt by the Palestinians to
predetermine their international status because this is a clear
violation of the Olso accords,'' he said.
	   With the new designation, Palestinian representatives can raise
issues of the peace process in the assembly, cosponsor draft
resolutions on Mideast peace, and reply on record to speeches made
at the world body. The representative cannot vote or put forward
candidates for U.N. committees, such as the Security Council.
	   More important, the vote affirms international support for
Palestinians in the protracted Mideast peace process.
	   ``A small victory was achieved for Palestine today, and we thank
you all for that,'' said the Palestinian representative, Nasser
al-Kidwa, after the vote. He said he hoped the Palestinians would
get full voting membership in the near future. ``That shall be a
big victory.''
	   The resolution notes that Palestinians are full members of the
Arab League, the Group of 77 and other regional organizations and
that ``the Palestinian Authority was established on part of the
occupied Palestinian territory.''
	   Israel's U.N. ambassador, Dore Gold, said this reference was an
effort to link the resolution to the status of disputed
territories.
	   ``The clear purpose of this effort is to affect the outcome of
the permanent status negotiations over this territory by abusing
the U.N. system,'' he said.
	   The Palestine Liberation Organization was granted observer
status in the General Assembly in 1974, enabling it to maintain an
office in New York but without the same privileges as missions of
U.N. member states.
	   Other observers are Switzerland, the Holy See and international
organizations such as the European Community.
	   The Palestinian Liberation Organization's status was upgraded in
1988 when the General Assembly decided to designate the PLO as
``Palestine.''
	   In December, the Arab states submitted a resolution to upgrade
the Palestinians' status to that of a nonvoting member.
	   Israel and the United States strongly opposed the move and the
resolution was derailed until Arab states resurrected it last
month.

Checa improving steadily after grand prix crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) _ Spanish 500cc rider Carlos Checa was
recovering in hospital Tuesday following surgery to remove his
spleen after he crashed at the British motorcycle Grand Prix on
Sunday.
	   Checa was ``improving steadily'' in Queen's Medical Centre,
Nottingham, following the emergency operation and a subsequent
stroke which affected his vision and movement.
	   A hospital spokesman said on Tuesday that Checa, currently
ranked fourth in the world rider's championship, would stay in
intensive care for ``at least the next 24 hours''.
	   ``Carlos has now stabilized and is improving steadily. There is
no further news on the problem with his vision as accurate
assessment is difficult whilst he is on medication,'' the spokesman
said.
	   The Honda rider, who finished fifth at the Dutch Grand Prix at
his most recent start, crashed during practise at Donington Park.

Israeli shells, jets attack suspected Hezbollah bases
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli ground forces fired about 150
artillery shells and warplanes attacked suspected Hezbollah
guerrilla bases in south Lebanon Tuesday, security officials said.
	   According to unconfirmed reports there were some casualties,
said the officials in this southern port city. They did not
elaborate.
	   They said the air raid on the Shiite Muslim villages of Yater
and Blatt followed firefights between Israeli troops and guerrillas
of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah near Blatt.
	   The village is on the western edge of Israel's occupied border
enclave in the south.
	   Israeli forces fired about 150 artillery shells at suspected
guerrilla hideouts, said the officials. The extensive firepower
indicated heavy ground combat.
	   Hezbollah said in a statement that it attacked the an Israeli
outpost in Blatt shortly before nightfall. It did not however
mention any casualties.
	   There was no immediate word on the raid from the Israeli army
command.
	   The violence came less than an hour after a multinational
committee monitoring a U.S.-brokered cease-fire in south Lebanon
urged Israel and Lebanese guerrillas to avoid targeting civilians.
	   The committee comprises truce monitors from the United States,
France, Lebanon, Syria and Israel. It was set up to oversee the
agreement to spare civilians, which was reached after an Israeli
bombing blitz of southern Lebanon in April 1996.
	   The security zone is a 440-square-mile (1,100-square-kilometer)
enclave Israel has occupied since 1985 to protect its northern
towns from cross-border guerrilla incursions.
	   The targeted area is believed to be used by Hezbollah guerrillas
seeking to force Israel out of the occupied zone, which is
patrolled by 1,500 Israeli soldiers and the 2,500-strong South
Lebanon Army militia.

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ With trucks and cars, strikers
blaring horns blocked the main highway to San Juan's international
airport Tuesday, the first volley in what threatened to be Puerto
Rico's biggest strike in decades.
	   Police officers escorted tourists who were forced to walk 1 1/2
miles (2.5 kilometers) to the airport terminal, loaded down with
bags and sweating in the tropical heat.
	   ``I'm with the strikers,'' said Mildred Gonzalez, a driver
caught in the traffic jam.
	   Union leaders expected up to half a million of Puerto Rico's 3.8
million people to join the 48-hour general strike to protest the
sale of the state telephone company. Most are government employees,
including utility and health workers.
	   The blockade of hundreds of vehicles across the six-lane
Baldorioty de Castro cut off access east of San Juan to Luis Munoz
Marin International Airport and a string of towns including
Carolina, Loiza and Fajardo port.
	   ``Well, I'm never coming here again!'' said Spanish tourist
Felipe de Andrea as protesters helped him heft his trunk and a case
over the freeway divider. Riot police carried them to a police van
that took him and other stranded visitors to the airport.
	   American Airlines said it canceled one early flight to Miami
because only 59 of an expected 138 passengers were able to get to
the airport, which handles 300 flights a day.
	   Arriving passengers were able to leave by another exit, though
hotels said hundreds of tourists canceled vacations.
	   Many business were open, but major shopping malls closed for the
strike, fearing violence amid a rash of bomb threats.
	   Before dawn Tuesday, gunmen shot out windows of a branch of
Banco Popular, the biggest local bank which is involved in buying
the telephone company. There have been similar shootings, and a
bomb exploded outside another bank branch, blowing a finger off a
policeman's hand.
	   On Monday night, shopkeepers barred windows with steel shutters,
riot police guarded ports and power plants and residents stocked up
on water and batteries.
	   ``You'd think we were preparing for a hurricane,'' one shopper
said, her arms crammed with candles and water bottles.
	   The strike was called to support 6,400 telephone employees who
stopped working June 18 and are accused of slashing telephone lines
that left more than 250,000 islanders without long-distance
service.
	   While telephone workers are afraid they will lose their jobs,
the sale has much wider implications as the most ambitious
privatization effort by Gov. Pedro Rossello, who has tried to
reduce the government's stake in hospitals, prisons, hotels and a
shipping company.
	   Independent-minded leaders of the biggest unions, which
represent government workers, see their power waning and accuse the
pro-statehood Rossello of ``selling the patrimony of the people''
to a U.S. company.
	   Rossello signed legislation completing the dlrs 1.9 billion sale
to a consortium led by U.S. communications giant GTE Corp. and
Banco Popular, which lost dlrs 140 million in labor union accounts
last week.
	   But the government committee in charge of the sale said it was
``seriously considering'' a last-minute, dlrs 2.025 billion
counterbid from Spain's Telefonica Internacional S.A.

Assad to visits France from July 16
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Syrian President Hafez Assad will visit
France this month in his first official trip to that country in
nearly 22 years, a presidential statement said Tuesday.
	   Assad's three-day visit beginning July 16 will include talks
with President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, the
statement said.
	   It did not elaborate, but the talks are expected to focus on the
stalled Middle East peace process and bilateral relations.
	   Assad last went to France in the autumn of 1976 at the
invitation of then President Valery Giscard d'Estaing.
	   President Chirac, who has sought a role for France in the Middle
East peace process, visited Syria in October 1996.
	   Syria is pushing for a more active European role in the peace
process since talks with Israel broke down over the strategic Golan
Heights which Israel captured from Syria during the 1967 Mideast
war.
	   Syria wants the heights back in exchange for peace but Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel should retain
control over the heights and rejects a land-for-peace strategy.

	   John Laverty, head of the construction firm, said all engineers
and construction workers on the site when the bridge collapsed on
Monday were accounted for.
	   Thirteen people died and 16 were injured, several seriously. The
last body was retrieved late Tuesday, Laverty said.
	   He discounted earlier radio reports by the South African
Broadcasting Corp. that another 12 workers were missing and feared
dead.
	   Police Capt. Izak van Zyl said rescue dogs did not detect any
signs of life in the rubble on Tuesday.
	   A 90-meter (yard) section of the bridge collapsed when a support
pillar gave way.
	   The confirmed death toll was earlier given at 15 but later
revised to 13.
	   Police, forensic experts and investigators from the Labor
Department were investigating the accident.
	   The 300 meter- (yard-) long bridge was being built over the
Marite River near Bushbuckridge, 400 kilometers (250 miles)
northeast of Johannesburg.

	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli ground forces fired about 150
artillery shells, and warplanes attacked suspected Hezbollah
guerrilla bases in south Lebanon Tuesday, security officials said.
	   According to unconfirmed reports there were some casualties,
said the officials in this southern port city. They did not
elaborate.
	   They said the air raid on the Shiite Muslim villages of Yater
and Blatt followed firefights between Israeli troops and guerrillas
of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah near Blatt.
	   In a statement, the Israeli army spokesman's office confirmed
the air raids on Yater and said the pilots reported accurate hits.
	   The statement did not mention the fighting in Blatt, a village
that is on the western edge of Israel's occupied border enclave in
the south.

Britain sending more troops to combat Protestant mayhem
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW throughout for AMs &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Britain said Tuesday it will
deploy more troops to Northern Ireland to combat widespread
Protestant intimidation aimed at overthrowing the ban on an Orange
Order march through a Catholic neighborhood.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair agreed to meet leaders of the
80,000-strong Protestant brotherhood after two nights of rioting
over whether Orangemen can parade through the main Catholic enclave
of Portadown, the group's spiritual heartland southwest of Belfast.
	   In Portadown, several hundred Orangemen remained encamped in
tents outside the rural Drumcree Anglican church, where extensive
barbed-wire barricades prevented their annual parade from going
near Catholic homes along Garvaghy Road on Sunday.
	   They have vowed to hold their ground until authorities let them
complete their parade along the route they have used since 1807.
	   The fight over whose rights should dominate _ Orangemen or
Garvaghy Road's anti-Orange protesters _ has sparked sectarian
mayhem across Northern Ireland for three summers running, with the
Orangemen prevailing each time.
	   ``No march should enter any area where they are not wanted. This
is not an issue of conflicting rights. It is an issue of equality,
of civil rights,'' said Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA-allied Sinn
Fein party, which in 1995 began organizing opposition to Orange
parades that pass near Catholic areas.
	   Calling the Orange Order ``a sectarian, anti-Catholic
organization,'' Adams said its leaders must meet the Garvaghy Road
protest leader, former Irish Republican Army prisoner Breandan
MacCionnaith.
	   Instead, Orange leaders plan to meet Thursday with Blair to
demand their right ``to walk the queen's highway,'' which Blair has
insisted cannot happen on Garvaghy Road unless the Orangemen
negotiate with their enemies.
	   The Royal Ulster Constabulary calculated that, from Sunday
afternoon to Tuesday morning across the province, 42 police
officers were wounded, 101 vehicles torched as road barricades and
213 others damaged, 110 homes and other buildings vandalized, and
63 rioters arrested.
	   Police said joint police and army patrols were barraged by
gasoline bombs on 330 separate occasions.
	   They had no statistics for wounded rioters or soldiers, who
support the 13,000-member police force. The army announced Tuesday
it would reinforce its 18,000-member garrison in Northern Ireland
with two battalions from England.
	   Orange leaders insisted that, despite organizing mass protests
against the authorities for blocking their Portadown march, they
were not responsible for the Protestant riots.
	   Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble, an Orangeman and the
new head of Northern Ireland's cross-community government, accused
the rioters of ``continuing the work that the IRA have been engaged
in for the past 30 years.''
	   ``Orangemen must realize that if this violence continues, it
will only be a matter of time before we once again are following
coffins,'' warned Trimble, who championed their right to march down
Garvaghy Road in 1995 but now stands accused of betrayal because he
accepted April's peace agreement.
	   Protestants mounted protests all day in Portadown. In the
morning, they blocked both ends of Garvaghy Road, preventing people
from getting to work or food deliveries going in.
	   Later, soldiers prevented 500 Protestant women and children from
parading to isolated Protestant homes on the edge of Garvaghy Road.
Another parade passed through central Portadown, where police said
shop owners were being threatened if they didn't shut their
businesses.
	   In the crowd were members of Northern Ireland's most ruthless
Protestant gang, the Loyalist Volunteer Force. The outlawed group
killed its first Catholic in 1996 immediately after police blocked
Portadown's Orangemen that year.
	   The LVF's reputed commander and henchmen have already made
well-received visits to the Orange camp outside Drumcree church.
	   Kenny McClinton, a paroled Catholic-killer and confidante of the
group, said LVF members might strike again ``if they see
Protestants being bludgeoned off the roads.''

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ India made a splendid fight-back to
beat Sri Lanka by six runs and win the 3-nation Independence Cup
cricket tournament under lights at the Premadasa Stadium in Colombo
on Tuesday.
	   The Sri Lankans at one stage looked set to win the game at 280
for 4, but with the dismissal of veteran campaigner Aravinda de
Silva for 105 the tourists made a sensational return to bundle out
the home side for 301 in the third ball of the last over.
	   Enraged spectators threw empty water bottles and other objects
onto the field to vent their disappointment after Indian
wicket-keeper Nayan Mongia flicked off the bails to run out
Pramodya Wickremasinghe who attempted a second run. Sri Lanka
needed nine runs in the last over bowled by leg-spinner Anil
Kumble.
	   Mongia earlier in the innings pulled off a spectacular catch off
paceman Ajit Agarkar to get rid of Arjuna Ranatunga for 23.
	   Indian openers Sachin Tendulkar and Saurav Ganguly earlier
hammered centuries to set up a world record partnership of 252 runs
for the first wicket as the tourists batted untroubled on a docile
pitch.
	   Tendulkar smashed 128 in 131 balls while Ganguly stroked 109 as
the pair put on an imposing 252 runs to surpass a previous best 225
by Kenya's Kennedy Otieno and Dipak Chudasaman against Bangladesh
at Nairobi, Kenya in 1997/98.
	   Tendulkar blasted his first 50 in only 39 balls with six fours
and one six but reached the balance 50 runs with just a single
boundary added as he led the way in consolidating India's position
after his skipper Mohammed Azharuddin won the toss and decided to
bat.
	   Tendulkar in all hit eight fours and two sixes before the video
umpire ruled him stumped off a ball from Sanath Jayasuriya in the
44th over.
	   Tendulkar in the process equaled a world record of 17 centuries
in one-day internationals set by West Indies batsman Desmond
Haynes.
	   Tendulkar was named man-of-the-match while De Silva was adjudged
man-of-the-series.
	   Ganguly fell in the next over giving Muttiah Muralitheran a
return catch after hitting six fours and two sixes.
	   Ganguly however survived an anxious moment when wicket keeper
Romesh Kaluwitharana's leg-side appeal for a catch against Kumara
Dharmasena was turned down with his score on 98 and the total on
233.
	   The exits of Tendulkar and Ganguly did not bring an end to Sri
Lanka's woes as Robin Singh (15) and Ajay Jadeja (25) wrecked
further havoc on the home side.
	   Jadeja made his runs in only 25 balls while hitting Dharmasena
for two successive sixes over long-on.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Cypriot Defense Minister Yiannakis Omerou arrived
in Moscow Tuesday for talks with defense officials that will focus
on the delivery of Russian missiles to Cyprus, a news agency
reported.
	   Omerou was invited to Russia by the state-owned arms trading
company Rosvooruzheniye, the Interfax news agency said, quoting
Defense Ministry officials.
	   The delivery of S-300 air defense missiles to Cyprus will
dominate the talks, the official said. They said delivery of the
missiles may be put off until the end of the year.
	   Omerou was scheduled to meet with Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev
and other officials, Interfax said.

Dutch, Brazilian fans live it up _ peacefully _ before kickoff
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MORT ROSENBLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Special Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Dutchy the Lion stormed the beach
Tuesday. A raven-haired Brazilian woman wearing only fragments of
green and yellow fabric danced in the Old Port. Tens of thousands
of other Dutch and Brazilians sang, shouted and chugalugged.
	   Not even the World Cup crowd can drink France dry, but hearty
bands of survivors are doing their best. Four nations remain in the
tournament. As the soccer narrows down to high-intensity,
high-stakes final stages, so does the partying.
	   France meets Croatia in Paris on Wednesday to determine which of
the two makes the finals Sunday __ and who can throw a better
street party. And on Tuesday in Marseille, it was Brazil and
Holland.
	   On a scorching day, both sides partied together at Prado Beach
by the giant screen where English hooligans and ethnic Tunisian
locals rumbled last month. Also, they gathered at the port, another
England-Tunisia riot scene, now swept clean of broken glass.
	   ``We are the champions,'' bellowed Stephan Dammers, a
25-year-old medical supplier from Den Bosch with a bright orange
face, along with the music blasting out of monster speakers on the
beach. This was before the game, but the Dutch had no doubts.
	   Their opponents, whose faces were painted in blue, green and
yellow, had four prior World Cups to boast about. They looked
indulgently at the happy Dutch and chanted, ``Five times, five
times.''
	   Dammers had painted his predicted score in orange on his bare
chest, 1-0, without bothering to specify the victor. He arrived
Tuesday after a 15-hour bus ride only to head back on the bus _
jubiliant or despondent _ an hour after the final whistle.
	   ``Of course, it's worth it,'' he said. ``Just look around.''
	   Nearby, the team's mascot, Dutchy, a guy in a furry lion suit,
had just been ferried in over the waves in an open boat. People in
silly orange hats and capes snakedanced on the sand. Others,
without capes, splashed in the water.
	   The eclectic mix of music, brought from Holland, was heavy on
the universal soccer fans' unofficial theme, ``You'll Never Walk
Alone.'' It included ``Deep in the Heart of Texas,'' ``YMCA,'' and,
inexplicably, ``The Star-Spangled Banner.''
	   Among the crowd of gyrating Dutchmen, Karina Ramos from Rio de
Janeiro danced in green and yellow short shorts, a matching halter
and blue lips. Her friend Nelson Almeida, had a Brazilian flag on
the rippling muscles of his bare Tarzan chest.
	   ``Sure we'll win, but we can have fun together,'' Ramos said,
adjusting her Dutch orange cape and partying on.
	   At the port, it was more of the same. The police who had battled
with English and Tunisian fans were relaxed this time, rerouting
traffic to give the crowds room to frolick in the street.
	   Atop a small bus stop shelter, five fans combined into a living
statue. Four flew Brazilian flags at jaunty angles. A fifth, in a
tall orange hat and a Dutch blue-white-red flag, stood in the
center.
	   At a sidewalk cafe, a man with orange hair had a friendly
argument with a woman in blue and yellow hair over the likely
score. Neither spoke the other's language, so they held up fingers.
	   Gerson Senko, who works for Exxon in Rio, looked dignified
despite his splash of soccer-fan colors. He was banking on a 5-0
victory. His wife, Andrea, figured 4-2 was more likely. Neither had
given a thought to missing out on the World Cup.
	   The crowds were heavily laced with Frenchmen along with
foreigners whose teams have been eliminated. But it was hard to
tell. In this tournament, the idea is to pick a team and blend in
with its colors.
	   At Prado Beach, restaurateur Carlos Contreras was rooting for
Brazil, but he is Colombian. His own team did not get past the
early rounds.
	   ``I guess it's South American solidarity,'' he said. ``But even
more, it's the fun. The whole idea is to have a good time in
France. That much, I'm doing.''

Myanmar democracy leader stopped after leaving home without

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu
Kyi was reported to be refusing to leave her car Tuesday evening 80
kilometers (50 miles) north of Yangon after making a surprise move
to break away from her semi-official confinement at her home in the
capital, official sources said Tuesday.
	   A statement issued Tuesday night by the military government said
that Mrs. Suu Kyi, head of the National League for Democracy,
accompanied by party chairman Aung Shwe, another party official and
their driver, ``were stopped by the local security officials at
Shwe Mya Yar village.''
	   The statement said the local officials noticed that the
government security personnel who always accompany Suu Kyi on her
rare and closely-guarded trips outside her house were absent.
	   After making an inquiry they asked her group not to proceed with
their trip to Min Hla Township, 147 kilometers (92 miles north of
Yangon. The statement did not say why they might be going there.
	   The reported absence of the security team seemed to suggest that
Suu Kyi may have managed to sneak away from her closely-guarded
residence, where she was held under house arrest without trial from
1989 to 1995.
	   A military official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
that Suu Kyi's group remained at the spot Tuesday evening.
	   Shortly before midnight Tuesday, she had not yet returned to her
home.
	   The incident comes a time of heightened confrontation between
the military regime in Myanmar _ also called Burma _ and Suu Kyi's
opposition National League for Democracy, which recently demanded
that the military seat the winners of a 1990 general election. The
league won a sweeping victory in the polls.
	   In an incident June 25, unidentified men assaulted members of
the youth wing of her party outside her home after police tried to
block them from holding a regularly scheduled meeting.
	   Suu Kyi reportedly fell or was pushed to the ground during the
melee, and held an overnight sit-in on the street with the party
youths afterwards.
	   Tuesday's official statement said Suu Kyi's group were asked to
return to the capital ``after permission to proceed was denied ...
on grounds of security and prevention as well as the making of
unnecessary political agitation and activities intending to create
a head-on collision and confrontation with the relevant authorities
in an attempt to bring about social unrest and political
disturbances.''
	   The statement also noted that Tuesday was the anniversary of a
government crackdown on students in 1962 who were protesting
military rule. Several students died in the confrontation at the
country's main university in the capital, and the government blew
up the student union, which it saw as the hub of rebellion.
	   ``It is regretful that the NLD leadership has deliberately
chosen the occasion to create unnecessary and unwanted confusion,
confrontation and collision and thereby to threaten the disruption
of the prevailing peace, tranquility and stability at any cost,''
it said.
	   It also accused the media and some foreign embassies in Yangon
of taking part in ``a fabrication and disinformation campaign ...
to mislead the world into thinking that an internal revolution and
ethnic uprising are imminently brewing in Myanmar.''

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) -- Former President Sali Berisha declared
Tuesday that his opposition Democratic Party will again boycott
parliament to protest the coalition government which he accused of
mismanaging the country.
	   Berisha's statement came after a six-hour meeting of his party's
leadership.
	   ``This is a protest against the government, which is leading the
country into total crises, corruption and violence,'' Berisha told
reporters afterward.
	   The Democrats ruled Albania from 1992 until June 1997, when they
were rejected by the voters after the collapse of the pyramid
investment schemes in which many Albanians lost their life savings.
	   Berisha and his party first boycotted the Socialist-dominated
parliament last September, calling it illegitimate. Under strong
international pressure, they returned in March.
	   The Democrats hold only 28 of the 150 parliament seats.
	   The ruling Socialists have blamed the Democrats -- and in
particular Berisha -- for last year's destruction and the loss of
about 2,000 lives during nationwide unrest which followed the
pyramid scheme fisaco.

Argentine judge interviews women over child kidnappings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Investigating charges that Argentina's
former military dictatorship systematically abducted children of
dissidents it killed, Argentine Federal Judge Adolfo Bagnasco on
Tuesday interviewed two women imprisoned under the regime.
	   The former inmates of Buenos Aires' infamous Naval Mechanics
School, who now live in Switzerland, were interviewed at
Argentina's embassy in Bern.
	   Bagnasco told a news conference he plans to interview two more
women in Bern. Many witnesses didn't want to travel to return to
Argentina to testify, he said.
	   The judge said he is still awaiting permission from Spain to
speak to other witnesses in Madrid next Monday.
	   The investigation aims to determine whether the generals in
charge of Argentina from 1976-83 organized abductions.
	   Originally built to teach mechanical skills to navy personnel,
the Naval Mechanics School was converted into a clandestine jail,
torture and killing center during the dictatorship.
	   Speaking on Swiss radio, one of the witnesses said women gave
birth chained to tables in the presence of torturers.
	   Their babies were taken away and mothers had to write a letter
asking unknown foster parents to take care of them, she added.
	   An Argentine government report says more than 9,000 people
disappeared between 1976-83 when the military cracked down on
leftists and political dissidents. Rights groups put the figure
closer to 30,000.
	   Last month, former president Jorge Rafael Videla, who seized
power in a 1976 coup, was arrested on suspicion of ordering the
kidnapping of children born to parents who were killed during the
dictatorship. He was also charged with falsifying identity
documents.
	   Although democracy was restored in 1983, President Carlos
Menem's pardon of all middle-ranking and senior officers in 1990
has left an uneasy relationship between the military and the
general population.
	   Videla's detention revealed one loophole in the pardon, which
does not include child kidnapping.

Uganda's President Museveni tries to stop Eritrea-Ethiopia

conflict.
 &UR; By ABEBE ANDUALEM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
on Tuesday became the latest emissary to try to stop a two-month
border conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea that has left hundreds
dead.
	   The Ugandan leader met Prime Minister Melees Zenawi and
President Negasso Ghidada in the Ethiopian capital after talks
Monday with President Isaias Afwerki in neighboring Eritrea, a
Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
	   The contents of the talks was not revealed.
	   The spokesman said Museveni would meet separately with both men
on Wednesday.
	   Since May 6, Ethiopia and Eritrea have been fighting around
their border. In early June hundreds died when the two countries
bombed each other's territory.
	   There have been no reports of fighting in recent days, but both
governments have massed armies along their border.
	   President Laurent Kabila of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, has also tried to defuse the situation, but his visit last
week yielded no results.
	   Four ambassadors representing the Addis Ababa-based Organization
of African Unity (OAU) have also been working to stop the violence,
after leaders from Burkina Fasso, Zimbabwe, Rwanda and Djibouti met
with both governments last month.
	   On Monday, Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu said his country
would withdraw from the OAU team after it became apparent that
Rwanda's involvement endangered the OAU effort.
	   Speaking to reporters in the Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam on
Monday, Bizimungu said after Eritrea had rejected an initial peace
proposal put forward by Rwanda and the United States, it became
clear Eritrea would not regard Rwanda's participation as ``a new
process.''
	   But he said his country still supported the OAU efforts.
	   Prime Minister Meles said Monday that while he still hoped for
peace, he was not afraid of using armed forces to defend his
country.
	   ``If the Eritrean government persists in its refusal to withdraw
its forces from Ethiopian territory, I would like to ... assure
parliament and the Ethiopian people that we will safeguard by force
our sovereignty and territorial integrity,'' he told parliament.
	   After fighting with rebels attempting to overthrow the Ethiopian
military regime in 1991, Eritrean rebels, who had been fighting
Ethiopia for 30 years, were rewarded with independence in 1993.
	   Now, each country blames the other for occupying parts of its
territory.
	   Meles told parliament tens of thousands of youths are training
to fight and Ethiopians have given 100 million birr (dlrs 14
million) toward the war effort.

U.N. prosecutor vows to bring charges if evidence of atrocities
</HEADLINE>
found &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A U.N. tribunal prosecuting war
crimes in the former Yugoslavia said Tuesday it won't hesitate to
bring charges against Kosovo's warring parties if evidence of
atrocities emerges.
	   In a stern message to leaders of the so-called Contact Group
nations meeting Wednesday in Bonn, Germany, Yugoslav war crimes
tribunal chief prosecutor Louise Arbour reaffirmed her authority to
file charges related to the deteriorating situation in the troubled
Serbian province.
	   ``The prosecutor believes that the nature and scale of the
fighting indicate that an `armed conflict,' within the meaning of
international law, exists in Kosovo,'' the U.N. court said in a
statement.
	   ``As a result, she intends to bring charges for crimes against
humanity or war crimes if evidence of such crimes is established,''
it said.
	   The U.N. court was set up in 1993 by the Security Council to
bring to justice those who carried out atrocities during the
conflicts in the former Yugoslavia.
	   But Arbour, of Canada, has traveled to Kosovo on a fact-finding
mission to investigate reports of possible atrocities in Kosovo,
where ethnic Albanians fighting for an independent province
outnumber Serbs 9-to-1. Hundreds of people have been killed.
	   ``The tribunal's jurisdiction also includes crimes committed by
persons on either side of the conflict,'' the tribunal statement
said. ``International law imposes obligations on combatants
involved in an armed conflict to observe the laws of war.''
	   The court said it would hold not only perpetrators criminally
responsible, but also their superiors who failed to take actions to
prevent or stop war crimes.
	   Critics of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in the U.S.
Congress have said he should be indicted for crimes against
humanity for his crackdowns on ethnic Albanians.
	   New York-based Human Rights Watch has accused both sides of war
crimes and human rights violations.
	   It claims to have ``powerful evidence'' that Serb police
``summarily executed'' an unspecified number of ethnic Albanians
between February and May. It has also faulted the Kosovo Liberation
Army for ``detentions and attacks on Serbian civilians.''

Bahrain rejects Qatar's claims on disputed islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Rejecting objections by neighboring
Qatar, Bahrain on Tuesday defended its plan to develop a chain of
disputed islands, saying the area is an integral part of Bahraini
territory.
	   The Hawar Islands have ``always formed the integral part'' (of
Bahrain) ... they have never formed the part of the state of
Qatar,'' a foreign ministry official was quoted by the official
Gulf News Agency as saying.
	   ``Therefore, no development undertaken by the state of Bahrain
in the Hawar Islands can in any way be viewed as altering the
status quo,'' the official was quoted as saying.
	   The statement was in response to Qatari remarks on Monday that
the Bahraini moves are a violation of a 1987 territorial accord
brokered by Saudi Arabia
	   Last month Bahrain's Housing Minister Sheik Khalid bin Abdullah
Al Khalifa unveiled plans to develop and link the Hawar Islands to
the mainland with a 22.5-kilometer (14-mile) bridge.
	   Bahrain has already constructed a hotel on the tourist resort
island and launched a hovercraft service last year.
	   The government says the project does not constitute a violation
of any agreements.
	   Rather, it accuses Qatar of trying to divert attention from
Bahraini accusations that the emirate submitted forged documents on
the dispute to the International Court of Justice, which began
mediating in February 1995.
	   The World Court, based in the Hague, Netherlands, has given
Qatar until Sept. 30 to prove the authenticity of its submitted
documents.
	   The dispute also is over water boundaries and the Zubara land
strip in Qatar where Bahrain's royal family lived 200 years ago.
	   Qatar and Bahrain, which have close ties to the United States
and Western Europe, have been feuding over the disputed territory
since the mid-1980s.

Magnus Larsson ousted by unheralded Spaniard
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASTAD, Sweden (AP) _ Unheralded Spaniard Fernando Vicente
Tuesday upset fourthseeded Magnus Larsson 7-6 (7-4), 6-0 to pull
off the biggest surprise of the first round of the Swedish Open ATP
tournament.
	   The loss to the 21-year-old Spaniard did not improve Larsson*s
chances to qualify for one of the singles in Sweden*s Davis Cup
team against Germany next week. Larsson is nominated on the DC team
along with Jonas Bjorkman, Thomas Enqvist and doubles specialist
Nicklas Kulti.
	   The other three seeds in action moved into the second round with
little problem. Eighth seed Carlos Costa of Spain defeated Tomas
Nydahl of Sweden 6-2, 6-2, third seed Andrea Gaudenzi of Italy
overcame fellow-countryman Diego Nargiso 3-6, 6-2, 6-1 and second
seed Magnus Norman of Sweden beat Hicham Arazi of Morocco 7-5, 6-4.
	   In other action Jerome Golmard of France defeated Franco
Squillari of Argentina, 6-4, 6-2 and Davide Sanguinetti of Italy
whipped Mikael Tillstrom of Sweden, 6-2, 6-3.
	   Also through to the second round were Andrei Medvedev of Ukraine
who routed German Bernd Karbacher 6-2, 6-1 and Jiri Novak of the
Czech Republic who beat Dinu Pescarlu of Romania, 7-5, 6-4. Karim
Alami of Morocco had an easy run with Andrei Pavel of Romania who
withdrew at 5-0 in the first set.
	   In Wednesday*s action top-seed Magnus Gustafsson, chasing his
fourth Swedish Open title, will play Markus Hipfl, a qualifyer from
Austria.
	   Gustafsson, who also won here in 1991, 1992 and 1996, became the
top seed after czech Karol Kucera, twelfth in the ATP ranking,
withdrew last week due to a sprained ankle. If seasoned claycourt
player Gustafsson, now ranked 26th, wins again here he will be one
up on fellow Swedes Bjorn Borg and Mats Wilander, the only other
players with three titles.

NATO generals brief political side on planning for Kosovo action
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - NATO military chiefs briefed the
alliance's ambassadors Tuesday on the state of planning for action
in Kosovo where Serb police and military forces are battling with
ethnic Albanians.
	   NATO's foreign and defense ministers have ordered the military
to lay out a range of options for action in the southern Yugoslav
province in the even diplomatic efforts fail.
	   Complicating the work, NATO officials say, is the fluid
situation on the ground. Just a few weeks ago, a military
intervention in Kosovo seemed an imminent possibility as warplanes
from 13 of the 16 NATO nations roared over Albania and Macedonia in
four hours of heavy-duty sabre-rattling.
	   Today, diplomatic efforts have been stepped up, though they
don't appear any nearer to a solution than last month.
	   While the political side of NATO has sought military plans, the
planners have been seeking specific political guidance, details of
exactly what the politicians would want to achieve through military
action.
	   ``The military realizes this is not Dayton,'' said one NATO
official, referring to the peace agreement that ended the fighting
in Bosnia in 1995 and sent 60,000 NATO troops into the Balkans to
enforce the peace.
	   ``Kosovo is fluid, and I think they realize the political side
isn't able to answer all the questions they would like to have
answered,'' said the official, speaking on condition he not be
identified.
	   Planning is along four major lines:
	   - A preventive deployment of alliance troops along the borders
of Kosovo in neighboring Albania and Macedonia.
	   - A graduated air campaign involving strikes at specific targets
within Yugoslavia.
	   - A deployment of ground troops into Yugoslavia.
	   - A political-military strategy for managing the situation if it
is decided to use force.
	   More than 300 people have been killed in Kosovo since Serb
forces launched a crackdown on ethnic Albanian militants Feb. 28.
Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army is seeking independence for the
province, while other ethnic Albanians say they want a return to
the sort of autonomy they had prior to 1989.
	   On Monday a group of Belgrade-based diplomats from the United
States, Russia, Poland and the European Union, got a first-hand
look at regions of Kosovo that have seen heavy fighting. It was the
first in a series of planned monitoring missions.
	   NATO's top general, Klaus Naumann of Germany, chairman of the
Military Committee, went over the planning with the ambassadors,
answering questions and pointing out areas where further political
guidance is required, a NATO official said.
	   ``Our aim is to have a full set of options to present to
ministers whenever a decision has to be taken to bring NATO into
the equation,'' the official said.
	   ``As long as the situationin Kosovo remains fluid, NATO will
have to adapt planning and keep it up to date, according to what
happens.''

	   GSTAAD, Switzerland (AP) _ French Open finalist Alex Corretja
slipped in between rain delays on Tuesday to secure his place in
the second round of the dlrs 560,000 Swiss Open.
	   The third seed, who lost to compatriot Carlos Moya in the final
of Roland Garros, took advantage of a brief respite from the rain
to defeat German qualifier Oliver Gross 6-4, 4-6, 6-1.
	   In the day's only other completed match, lucky-loser Lucas
Arnold of Argentina dashed the hopes of 5,450 soggy spectators,
winning 6-4, 6-4 over home favorite Roger Federer, winner of the
Wimbledon junior title on Sunday.
	   Arnold was a late replacement for Germany's Tommy Haas,
suffering from food poisoning.
	   Eighth-seed Nicolas Kiefer of Germany trailed Spain's Juan
Albert Viloca 5-0 before their match was washed out, while Spaniard
Julian Alonso was leading Nicolas Escude 6-2, 3-3. The matches will
resume Wednesday.

Miners protest spreads to north, government refuses to negotiate
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new 4th graf miners blocking another railroad. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government will not negotiate with coal miners
as long as they continue their blockade of the Trans-Siberian
railway, a high-ranking official said Tuesday.
	   The miners responded by saying they will keep the railway shut
down until Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Sysuyev meets with them
personally to redress their demands.
	   As the miners blocked traffic on the Trans-Siberian for a fifth
day, miners in the far north joined the protests and halted trains
on another rail line, Russian news agencies reported.
	   Miners at several other mines in the Kemerovo region of Siberia
blocked the Novokuznetsk-Tashtagol railway, cutting off supplies of
iron ore to plants in Novokuznetsk, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   Several hundred miners in the central Siberian mining town of
Anzhero-Sudzhensk began the protest Friday over government plans to
close mines and reduce subsidies to local coal-related industries.
	   They said they will lift the blockade, at least temporarily, if
Sysuyev agrees to meet with them in Anzhero-Sudzhensk to review a
settlement that ended a similar blockade in May.
	   The miners claim the government is not paying the back wages it
promised in the agreement.
	   But Sysuyev said there can be no talks until the picket lines
are removed from the railway, Interfax said. The strikers regard
Sysuyev's reply as an ultimatum, and decided to ``stand to the
end,'' a strike committee spokesman told Interfax.
	   Trains are now stranded in several places along the
Trans-Siberian, with industry in the Tomsk region grinding to a
halt because the area's one link to the railway has been blocked,
the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Meanwhile, miners in the northern region of Komi have similar
complaints and began blocking a rail line on Tuesday, news reports
said.
	   The latest protests have resulted in an estimated 7 million
rubles (dlrs 1.2 million) in losses, Oleg Moshenko, the deputy
railway minister, was quoted as saying by ITAR-Tass.
	   The Russian Independent Miners Union estimated that nearly
60,000 miners have taken part in protests across Russia since the
start of the year, Interfax reported.
	   Russia has been gradually shutting down loss-making coal mines.
But some mines are the lone source of employment in isolated
regions, and unpaid miners have difficulty finding new work.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb security forces shelled four
villages in southern Kosovo Tuesday, ethnic Albanian sources said,
following the retreat of ethnic Albanian insurgents from another
village.
	   The Kosovo Information center, close to the ethnic Albanian
leadership claimed Serb forces shelled four villages along the
border with Albania near Djakovica. Flames and smoke were billowing
and there was large-scale destruction, but there were no reports on
causalities the center said.
	   Throughout the day, the fighting apparently spread further
south, towards the border with Albania, forcing civilians to flee.
	   The center also said 11 ethnic Albanians have been killed in the
last week, most of them in areas of clashes with Serb forces. This
figure does not include eight Albanians who, according to Serb
sources, were killed by Yugoslav army border guards last Sunday
while allegedly attempting to smuggle arms into Kosovo from
Albania.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo since Serb forces
launched a crackdown on ethnic Albanian terrorists in late Feb.
Recent attempts to bring ethnic Albanian leaders and the Yugoslav
government to the negotiating table have produced few results at
calming the situation in the province where ethnic Albanians
outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
	   Earlier Tuesday, the Serbs' Media Center claimed the ethnic
Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army had retreated from the village of
Lodja, roughly 30 kilometers (19 miles) northwest of Djakovica.
	   But with phone lines cut and the main road into the region
sealed off by Serb police for security reasons, few details on the
situation at Lodja were available Tuesday. Ethnic Albanian sources
reported continued sporadic shooting around the village Tuesday.
	   On Monday, the Kosovo Information Center reported one person was
killed and three wounded by heavy shelling of Lodja village. The
Serb Media Center reported two policemen killed and nine others
wounded.
	   The center also said 11 civilians and two policemen were also
evacuated from Lodja overnight, and large quantities of weapons
left behind by fleeing KLA forces confiscated.
	   Serb sources said armed Albanians opened fire on Serb villagers,
forcing a Serb counter-attack.
	   In a separate report, center said KLA fighters released two
Serbs kidnapped several days ago and handed them over to the
International Red Cross, who confirmed the action.
	   In neighboring Albania, the interior ministry reported a weekend
incursion of about 20 soldiers of the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army,
who took up combat positions for about an hour Sunday before
returning to home territory.
	   There was no official comment from Yugoslavia.
	   Militant ethnic Albanians fighting for independence for Kosovo
province from the southern Yugoslav republic of Serbia have been
regrouping and arming themselves inside the Albanian border for
months.
	   Last month, Yugoslav soldiers firing across the border killed an
Albanian man and two mules in an apparent effort to stop pack
trains carrying weapons across the border into Kosovo.

Israel attacks suspected Hezbollah bases
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli ground forces fired about 150
artillery shells and warplanes attacked suspected Hezbollah
guerrilla bases in south Lebanon on Tuesday, security officials
said.
	   According to unconfirmed reports, there were some casualties,
said the officials in the southern port city of Tyre. They did not
elaborate.
	   They said the air raid on the Shiite Muslim villages of Yater
and Blatt followed firefights between Israeli troops and guerrillas
from the Iranian-backed Hezbollah near Blatt.
	   In a statement, the Israeli army spokesman's office confirmed
the air raids on Yater and said the pilots reported accurate hits.
	   The statement did not mention the fighting in Blatt, a village
on the western edge of Israel's occupied border enclave in southern
Lebanon.
	   Israeli forces fired about 150 artillery shells at suspected
guerrilla hideouts, said the officials. The extensive firepower
indicated heavy ground combat.
	   Hezbollah said in a statement that it attacked the an Israeli
outpost in Blatt shortly before nightfall. It did not mention any
casualties.
	   There was no immediate word on the raid from the Israeli army
command.
	   The violence came less than an hour after a multinational
committee monitoring a U.S.-brokered cease-fire in south Lebanon
urged Israel and Lebanese guerrillas to avoid targeting civilians.
	   The committee comprises truce monitors from the United States,
France, Lebanon, Syria and Israel. It was set up to oversee the
agreement to spare civilians, which was reached after an Israeli
bombing blitz of southern Lebanon in April 1996.
	   The security zone is a 440-square-mile (1,100-square-kilometer)
enclave Israel has occupied since 1985 to protect its northern
towns from cross-border guerrilla incursions.
	   The targeted area is believed to be used by Hezbollah guerrillas
seeking to force Israel out of the occupied zone, which is
patrolled by 1,500 Israeli soldiers and the 2,500-member South
Lebanon Army militia.

UN upgrades Palestinian status over US objections

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; RAISES Israel downplaying significance of the

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The General Assembly agreed Tuesday to
give the Palestinians U.N. rights and powers just short of those
granted member states, despite opposition from the United States,
which said the move would harm the peace process.
	   Israel dismissed its significance as ``a minor correction'' in
the status of the Palestinian observer mission and said the
Palestinian attempt to change its standing violated peace accords.
The Palestinians called the 124-4 vote a huge step toward a
declaration of statehood.
	   The Arab-sponsored resolution gives the Palestinian observer
mission a unique, nonvoting seat in the 185-member assembly.
	   With the new designation, Palestinian representatives can raise
issues of the peace process in the assembly, cosponsor draft
resolutions on Mideast peace, and reply on record to speeches made
at the world body. The representative cannot vote or put forward
candidates for U.N. committees, such as the Security Council.
	   More important, however, the vote affirmed international support
for Palestinians in the protracted Mideast peace process.
	   ``It is an admission of their legitimate rights and it
constitutes support for the peace process,'' Nabil Abourdeineh, a
senior aide to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, told The
Associated Press. ``It is a huge step toward the imminent
declaration of statehood.''
	   No other entity has the nonvoting status, and the move was a
blow to the United States, Israel's closest ally at the United
Nations.
	   Washington had argued against the new designation, saying any
U.N. action on Israel or the Palestinians could jeopardize its
efforts to restart peace talks which have been stalled since March
1997.
	   ``This is the wrong resolution at the wrong time,'' U.S.
Ambassador Bill Richardson told the assembly before the vote. ``It
will undermine our efforts to get the peace process back on track
and hurt everyone's interests, including those it most intended to
help.''
	   The United States, Israel, Micronesia and the Marshall Islands
voted against the resolution. Ten members abstained.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the vote ``a
minor correction,'' in the Palestinian status but said he was
``concerned with the actual attempt by the Palestinians to
predetermine their international status because this is a clear
violation of the Olso accords.''
	   Israel's U.N. ambassador, Dore Gold, also rejected the attempt
as a violation of peace accords but said it represented ``no
effective change of the status of the PLO in the U.N.''
	   Austria's ambassador, Ernst Suchairpa, speaking on behalf of the
European Union, said he voted for the resolution because of
consistent Palestinian complaints that there was no charter that
codified the rights of observers.
	   ``The rights and privileges have been indeed granted over the
decades on a case by case basis,'' he said. ``This resolution is
therefore not regarded by the European Union as a creating a
precedent.''
	   The Palestine Liberation Organization was granted observer
status in the General Assembly in 1974, enabling it to maintain an
office in New York but without the same privileges as missions of
U.N. member states.
	   Other observers are Switzerland, the Holy See and international
organizations such as the European Community.
	   The Palestinian Liberation Organization's status was upgraded in
1988 when the General Assembly decided to designate the PLO as
``Palestine.''
	   In December, the Arab states submitted a resolution to upgrade
the Palestinians' status to that of a nonvoting member.
	   Israel and the United States strongly opposed the move and the
resolution was derailed until Arab states resurrected it last
month.

Turkey and Israel reaffirm strategic alliance, friendship
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The visiting Turkey foreign minister and
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed concerns
Tuesday from some Arab countries that their growing strategic ties
were a threat to regional stability.
	   Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem, who is on a four-day visit
to expand ties between the two countries, said Israel-Turkish
relations ``were not intended to work against any other country in
the region,'' and that no criticism of the relationship would be
taken into consideration.
	   Military and economic ties between secular-Muslim Turkey and
Israel have been rapidly developing since the two countries signed
a series of military agreements in 1996. Syria and Iran, among
other regional states have criticized the relationship, saying it
is a threat to peace and security in the region.
	   Netanyahu said that annual trade between the two countries is
close to dlrs 1 billion, and that the trade relations, strategic
alliance and friendship between the countries has done much to
promote the peace process.
	   ``There is no question that relations between Israel and Turkey
have contributed to the peace process,'' said Netanyahu. The
relationship, he said, added a ``measure of hope, and a measure of
stability to our region.''
	   Turkey was the first Muslim state to recognize Israel and also
one of the first to recognize Palestinian self-rule.
	   Cem was to meet Wednesday with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
in the autonomous city of Ramallah, West Bank, after visiting the
al-Aqsa mosque, in Jerusalem _ one of the holiest shrines in Islam.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Cem met with Israeli Trade Minister Natan
Sharansky to discuss bolstering economic relations. He will also
meet with Israel's president and parliament speaker before
departing the area.

Bavarian conservatives outraged at Greens' campaign poster with
</HEADLINE>
Jesus &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Bavarian conservatives on Tuesday were
outraged by a Greens' election campaign poster against state
Interior Minister Guenther Beckstein, known for tough policy on
foreigners, that says ``Beckstein would also expell Jesus.''
	   The poster is ``a scandalous attempt to use Jesus as a campaign
weapon,'' said Alois Glueck, the Christian Social Union's state
faction chairman, in a letter to Bavarian Greens' Chairman Ruth
Paulig.
	   State elections in Bavaria come two weeks before Sept. 27
national elections and the Greens have managed to keep the campaign
alive with controversial proposals, including 5-marks (dlrs 2.76)
for a liter (0.3 gallons) of gasoline, and a 100-kilometer (62
mile) speed limit on Germany's super highways.
	   The poster was sure to add to the attention they are getting.
	   Greens' spokesman Alex Burger said the party would continue to
distribute the poster to interested district supporters. In
addition, the few posters that were already put up would not be
removed, he said.
	   ``I find such a poster not only distasteful, but an atrocity,
and a deep point in the campaign of the democrats for a correct
way,'' Glueck wrote the Greens.
	   He said the poster was a ``disparagement and cut into the
honor,'' of Beckstein, a Christian.
	   Burger said that before Glueck talks about Christian politics,
he should see to it that his party rethinks its policy on
foreigners, especially expelling them.
	   Greens and other opposition politicians have in the past
criticized Beckstein for being too eager to return Bosnian war
refugees to their homeland, where many still face hostilities.
	   He has also reaped criticism for threatening to expel to Turkey
a 13-year-old Turkish schoolboy and his parents, because the boy
allegedly has a long record of robberies, theft and extortion.
	   The parents have gone to court to fight the expulsion.

Magnus Larsson ousted by unheralded Spaniard
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASTAD, Sweden (AP) _ Unheralded Spaniard Fernando Vicente upset
Magnus Larsson 7-6 (7-4), 6-0 on Tuesday to pull off the biggest
surprise of the first round of the Swedish Open ATP tournament.
	   The loss to the 21-year-old Spaniard did not improve Larsson's
chances to qualify for one of the singles in Sweden's Davis Cup
team against Germany next week. Larsson, who was seeded fourth, is
nominated team along with Jonas Bjorkman, Thomas Enqvist and
doubles specialist Nicklas Kulti.
	   The other three seeds moved into the second round with little
problem. Eighth seed Carlos Costa of Spain defeated Tomas Nydahl of
Sweden 6-2, 6-2, third seed Andrea Gaudenzi overcame fellow Italian
Diego Nargiso 3-6, 6-2, 6-1 and second seed Magnus Norman of Sweden
beat Hicham Arazi of Morocco 7-5, 6-4.
	   In other action Jerome Golmard of France defeated Franco
Squillari of Argentina, 6-4, 6-2 and Davide Sanguinetti of Italy
whipped Mikael Tillstrom of Sweden, 6-2, 6-3.
	   Also through to the second round were Andrei Medvedev of Ukraine
who routed German Bernd Karbacher 6-2, 6-1 and Jiri Novak of the
Czech Republic who beat Dinu Pescarlu of Romania, 7-5, 6-4. Karim
Alami of Morocco had an easy run with Andrei Pavel of Romania who
withdrew at 5-0 in the first set.
	   In Wednesday's action top-seed Magnus Gustafsson, chasing his
fourth Swedish Open title, will play Markus Hipfl, a qualifyer from
Austria.
	   Gustafsson, who also won here in 1991, 1992 and 1996, became the
top seed after Czech Karol Kucera withdrew last week due to a
sprained ankle. If clay master Gustafsson, now ranked 26th, wins
again here he will be ahead of fellow Swedes Bjorn Borg and Mats
Wilander, the only other players with three titles.

Two wives killed in U.S. Army helicopter crash in Bahamas

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ A U.S. Army helicopter on anti-drug duty
crashed on a Bahamian island during a maintenance flight, killing
the wives of two servicemen, injuring all three crew members and
raising questions about why the women were aboard.
	   The wives were flying in apparent violation of military
regulations. Civilians require special flight authorization, and
only the minimum crew is allowed on maintenance flights intended to
check repairs.
	   ``They've got to find out what in the world the wives were doing
on an Army aircraft,'' said a U.S. Army spokesman who asked that
his name not be used. ``The fact that they're civilians is the
issue.''
	   The women were listed on the flight manifest for the UH-60
Blackhawk based at Fort Stewart, Georgia, said Raul Duany,
spokesman for U.S. Southern Command in Miami. But it was unclear
whether they were authorized to fly, and Duany could not say why
they were aboard.
	   ``The helicopter was totally lost, totally broken,'' said Milton
Strachan Jr., the owner of a fuel aviation company who watched the
rescue near George Town airport on Great Exuma island.
	   A Bahamian police spokesman said the helicopter was taking off
when it crashed into brush about a quarter-mile from the runway.
But U.S. Coast Guard spokesman Jeff Murphy in Miami said the
helicopter landed hard on the runway and then skidded off.
	   Troops took nearly three hours to reach the site and remove one
of the women trapped inside, Strachan said.
	   The victims were identified, but their names were withheld while
the Army notified relatives.
	   The bodies of the two women were flown to Miami and taken to the
Miami-Dade County medical examiner's office.
	   The pilot and co-pilot were airlifted to Doctors Hospital in the
Bahamian capital of Nassau, where a spokeswoman said they were in
serious condition.
	   The crew chief, who was flown to Jackson Memorial Hospital in
Miami, was listed in stable condition in intensive care, said
spokeswoman Lorraine Nelson.
	   The crash Monday evening triggered two investigations, one by
the U.S. Army Safety Center based at Fort Rucker, Alabama, which
investigates all Army crashes, and the other by a collateral board
requested by Fort Stewart's 3rd Infantry Division, which was
responsible for the aircraft.
	   The helicopter was temporarily assigned to a U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration mission in the Bahamas, putting it under
the command of Southern Command rather than its home base.
	   The UH-60 helicopter is capable of carrying a crew of three and
14 combat-equipped troops. Crew seating is generally considered
safer because of its front-facing, energy-absorbing seats. The
side-facing rear passenger seats are not as sturdy.

NATO generals brief political side on planning for Kosovo action
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; WITH Yugoslavia-Kosovo
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - NATO military chiefs briefed the
alliance's ambassadors Tuesday on the state of planning for action
in Kosovo where Serb police and military forces are battling with
ethnic Albanians.
	   NATO's foreign and defense ministers have ordered the military
to suggest options for action in the southern Yugoslav province in
the even diplomatic efforts fail.
	   Complicating the work, NATO officials say, is the fluid
situation on the ground. Just a few weeks ago, a military
intervention in Kosovo seemed an imminent possibility as warplanes
from 13 of the 16 NATO nations roared over Albania and Macedonia in
four hours of heavy-duty sabre-rattling.
	   Today, diplomatic efforts have been stepped up, though they
don't appear any nearer to a solution than last month.
	   While the political side of NATO has sought military plans, the
planners have been seeking specific political guidance, details of
exactly what the politicians would want to achieve through military
action.
	   ``The military realizes this is not Dayton,'' said one NATO
official, referring to the peace agreement that ended the fighting
in Bosnia in 1995 and sent 60,000 NATO troops into the Balkans to
enforce the peace.
	   ``Kosovo is fluid, and I think they realize the political side
isn't able to answer all the questions they would like to have
answered,'' said the official, speaking on condition he not be
identified.
	   Planning is along four major lines:
	   - Preventive deployment of alliance troops along the borders of
Kosovo in neighboring Albania and Macedonia.
	   - An air campaign involving strikes at specific targets within
Yugoslavia.
	   - Deployment of ground troops into Yugoslavia.
	   - A political-military strategy for managing the situation if it
is decided to use force.
	   More than 300 people have been killed in Kosovo since Serb
forces launched a crackdown on ethnic Albanian militants Feb. 28.
Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army is seeking independence for the
province, while other ethnic Albanians say they want a return to
the sort of autonomy they had prior to 1989.
	   On Monday a group of Belgrade-based diplomats from the United
States, Russia, Poland and the European Union, got a first-hand
look at regions of Kosovo that have seen heavy fighting. It was the
first in a series of planned monitoring missions.
	   NATO's top general, Klaus Naumann of Germany, chairman of the
Military Committee, went over the planning with the ambassadors,
answering questions and pointing out areas where further political
guidance is required, a NATO official said.
	   ``Our aim is to have a full set of options to present to
ministers whenever a decision has to be taken to bring NATO into
the equation,'' the official said.
	   ``As long as the situationin Kosovo remains fluid, NATO will
have to adapt planning and keep it up to date, according to what
happens.''

World's most expensive golf club sells for 106,000 pounds (dlrs
</HEADLINE>
174,900)

<TEXT>
	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ The world's most expensive golf club
was bought Tuesday by Spain's Valderrama golf club for a record
106,000 pounds (dlrs 174,900) in an auction at Christie's.
	   The club, host to this year's Ryder Cup, paid more than twice
the auction house's forecast price for the rare metal-headed blade
putter, dating from the late 18th or early 19th century.
	   The putter, which Christie's said set a ``world auction record
price,'' was among 500 pieces of golf memorabilia which sold for a
total of 500,000 pounds (dlrs 800,000). The putter was sold by the
Royal Perth Golfing Society.
	   Among other items, a blacksmith-made cutoff nose track iron,
dating from the same period as the putter, was sold for 80,700
pounds (dlrs 129,120) to an unidentified private buyer.
	   A copy of the rules and members of the Royal Perth Golfing
Society in 1825, the year after it was founded, sold for 43,500
pounds (dlrs 69,600).
	   ``The sale has undoubtedly shown the underlying strength of the

Belarus president greets new military academy graduates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko
greeted new military academy graduates at his residence Tuesday,
praising their decision to serve their country and warning of
possible trouble ahead.
	   Belarus needs ``modern and mobile armed forces,'' Lukashenko
said, accusing the West of taking advantage of disarray in the
former Soviet bloc to gain military advantage.
	   The president denounced NATO's move into Eastern Europe, and
accused the West of trying to intimidate independent-minded
countries like Belarus _ a former Soviet republic that borders
Poland to the east.
	   ``Under these circumstances, we need to form a mobile,
well-equipped and well-trained army. As the head of state and
commander-in-chief of the armed forces, I promise that we'll have
such army,'' he told the 61 army, air defense and air force
graduates.
	   Lukashenko, an authoritarian leader, has been trying to forge
closer political, economic and military ties with Russia.

	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's most prominent political
prisoner, Moshood Abiola, died of a heart attack on Tuesday after

	   ``The federal government regrets to announce the sudden death of

	   Abiola, the apparent winner of 1993's canceled presidential
elections, was jailed the following year and accused of treason by
dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, who died last month of a heart attack.
	   A U.S. delegation, led by Thomas Pickering, is in Nigeria to
meet with the new military leadership and lobby for the release of
political prisoners, including Abiola.
	   Abiola's family had repeatedly warned that his health had been
failing after years in detention under harsh conditions.
	   Abiola's fortune and his personal life also suffered deeply
during his imprisonment. Two of his many wives died _ one in an
assassination-style slaying _ and his enormous business empire
largely collapsed.
	   Nigeria became an international pariah under the rule of Abacha,
who took power following a coup in 1993.
	   Political jailings were rampant during Abacha's lengthy
dictatorship; between 250 and 280 people are believed still held
across Nigeria. All are kept in regular prisons except for Abiola,
who had been detained in the relative comfort of a government guest
house in Abuja, the capital.

South African police deny faking evidence in Scottish man's murder
</HEADLINE>
case &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MTUNZINI, South Africa (AP) _ Police denied defense allegations
Tuesday they faked evidence against five young men on trial for the
murder of Scottish surgeon Spence Alexander.
	   John Hope, a sergeant attached to the Empangeni criminal records
center, told the Mtunzini High Court in the eastern KwaZulu-Natal
province that he lifted 10 fingerprints from Alexander's minibus,
which had been stolen by his killers and later abandoned near a
sugar cane field.
	   Hope denied allegations by lawyers for Xolani Mcunu, 18, that
police planted the suspect's fingerprints on Alexander's vehicle.
	   Hope said tampering with prints usually left ``telltale signs''
that could be detected.
	   Mcunu, Penwell Mazibuko, 22, Siphamandla Mthembu, 25, and two
juveniles pleaded innocent Monday to Alexander's murder and the
theft of his car.
	   One of the juveniles also claimed his fingerprints on the
minibus were ``contrived.''
	   Alexander, based in the provincial center of Empangeni, died
from a gun shot in the back after his minibus was stolen.
	   Deputy provincial attorney-general C.R. de Klerk on Monday said
state evidence showed one of the juveniles had been driving the
stolen vehicle. There were no witnesses to the murder.
	   De Klerk said fingerprints, hair samples and a bullet removed
from Alexander's back linked the five defendants to the murder.
	   He said the bullet was fired from a gun registered to Mthembu
and found in his possession at the time of his arrest.
	   A Browning pistol the prosecution identifies as the murder
weapon was introduced in court Tuesday.
	   Ballistics tests showed the gun fired the bullet recovered from
Alexander's back, police Inspector Gary du Preez said.

Guerrillas accuse oil giant in alleged human rights abuses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ In a letter to British Prime Minister
Tony Blair, a Colombian guerrilla group renewed charges that
British Petroleum and a private security firm it employs are
financing paramilitary groups which have massacred civilians.
	   ``England has declared war on our humble people,'' said the
letter from the National Liberation Army, Colombia's second-largest
leftist rebel group published Tuesday in El Tiempo newspaper.
	   A spokesman for BP denied the charges, which first surfaced in
1996 and prompted an official investigation. A British foreign
ministry official said he could not confirm receipt of the rebel
letter.
	   The public prosecutor's office in January cleared BP of
involvement with the feared paramilitary groups, while opening an
ongoing investigation into Defense System Colombia, a local
affiliate of a British firm and consultant to BP in security
matters.
	   Foreign oil companies suffer frequent dynamite attacks on
pipelines, kidnappings of executives and extortion by the rebels,
who say the firms exploit Colombia's natural resources.
	   The latest rebel charges come amid heightened peace expectations
since June 21 presidential elections.
	   The National Liberation Army and Colombian civic leaders have
set meetings beginning July 12 in Germany which could lead to
direct peace talks with president-elect Andres Pastrana, who takes
office in August.
	   Pastrana has invited foreign governments, including Britain and
the United States, to participate in the peace process.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi underwent
successful surgery to repair a hip broken when he was exercising,
Libyan news reports said Tuesday.
	   The operation was ``successfully conducted'' Monday night by
Libyan surgeons, the official news agency JANA said, but gave no
further details.
	   Later Tuesday, state television broadcast a video of the
surgery, showing Gadhafi under local anesthesia talking to aides
while a team of surgeons operated on his hip. Television cameras
repeatedly showed close-ups of the flesh where the incision was
made and while it was being sutured.
	   Gadhafi, 56, apparently recovered quickly and on Tuesday greeted
from a wheelchair many of the African dignitaries he had invited to
Libya to take part in prayers marking the birthday of Prophet
Mohammed. The visitors included U.S. Muslim activist leader Louis
Farrakhan who kissed Gadhafi on both cheeks.
	   Gadhafi had appeared at a news conference Monday, broadcast live
on state-run television, to announce that he broke a bone near his
hip while exercising.
	   The Libyan leader addressed the packed news conference while
reclining on a hospital bed, draped in a white sheet. Farrakhan and
some African leaders also were present in the room.
	   Gadhafi was supposed to lead them at the Islamic prayers Monday,
but the injury prevented him from doing so.

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ The Turkish prime minister is to cut
short his official visit to Macedonia and return to Turkey,
following a road accident involving his delegation which left two
dead, Macedonian state-run radio reported Tuesday.
	   Earlier in the day, a private car slammed into a vehicle that
was part of a motorcade carrying visiting Turkish Prime Minister
Mesut Yilmaz, killing two people and injuring four others.
	   No official confirmation that the report was cut shout was
immediately available.
	   Yilmaz and his Macedonian counterpart, Branko Crvenkovski, were
not injured. Four other members of the Turkish delegation and the
Macedonian driver of their car were hurt. A Macedonian man and a
woman in the oncoming car were also killed.
	   State-run Macedonian Radio said the accident occurred near the
town of Bitola, located 100 kilometers (60 miles) south of capital
Skopje.
	   Yilmaz visited the injured in hospital immediately after the
accident, where he told reporters cabinet minister Rustu Kazim
Yucelen and legislator Sinasi Altiner were both in stable
condition. The injured Turkish delegates were to be flown later to
Istanbul, the radio reported.
	   As he spoke, prominent Turkish journalist Fikret Bila, who was
reported in serious condition, underwent head surgery. No current
report on his condition was available.
	   A court official in Bitola, told reporters at a news conference
the oncoming car approached from a side road and crashed head-on
into the Turkish delegation's vehicle.
	   He said the official cause of the accident was unconfirmed, but
was probably due to the inexperience and panic of driver in the
oncoming car.
	   The Turkish delegation, which included a number of Turkish
businessmen seeking closer diplomatic and professional ties with
the former Yugoslav republic, were to open a consulate in Bitola.

Volkswagen decides to compensate Nazi-era slave laborers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 5-9 with comment from the Wiesenthal Center &QL; 
 &UR; By GEORGE BOEHMER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ In a change of heart, Volkswagen
announced Tuesday that it will open a private fund to pay slave
laborers who worked for the company under the Nazis during
1944-1945.
	   VW, Europe's largest automaker, had said last month that the
Nazi regime was responsible for wartime slave labor, and that any
claims should be directed to the regime's successor _ the current
German government.
	   The Wolfsburg-based company explained its new decision as ``done
in recognition of its historical and moral responsibilities arising
from the use of forced labor during World War II.''
	   Details of the planned fund will be released in mid-September.
	   Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean at the Los Angeles-based
Simon Wiesenthal Center, said ``We welcome the decision.''
	   ``It's a very appropriate gesture by a major German corporation
finally saying it's the time for us to do the right thing, instead
of trying to hide behind legalisms.''
	   Cooper said that even though the move came late, it would help
some people.
	   ``It will put pressure on other corporations and banks to remove
all sorts of legal firewalls that have been erected, and I hope
Swiss banks are looking at this this morning,'' he said.
	   Jewish groups are angered at Swiss banks for keeping the assets
of Holocaust victims. New York city and state said last week they
will withhold business from the banks to put pressure on them.
	   The Volkswagen announcement comes just weeks after 30 Hungarian
Jews forced to work for the company rejected their proposal to
establish a federally administrated compensation fund.
	   The lawyer for the former slave laborers, Klaus von
Muenchhausen, said June 17 that he was planning to sue VW because
the suggested fund was ``legally unrealistic.'' He said other
companies forced to pay into similar funds have managed to cease
payments.
	   The lawyer is seeking back wages for his clients, who are now in
their 70s. As teen-agers, they were sent from the Auschwitz death
camp in Poland to Volkswagen's main factory in Wolfsburg to build
weapons.
	   VW said it was not negotiating with Muenchhausen.
	   About 7 million slave laborers were forced to work in Nazi
Germany during the war. The German government has compensated Nazi
slave laborers for imprisonment and health damage, but has refused
to honor wage claims because laborers technically were working for
private companies.
	   German companies have largely avoided payments to forced
laborers. But the Diehl defense contracting company said in May it
would compensate surviving Jewish women. The women were taken from
a concentration camp at Grossposen, in what is now Poland, and
forced to work in two Diehl factories building munitions during the
war.

Van Goghs, Cezanne, back on view in Rome museum
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With ROM112, ROM113, ROM114 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Given new frames and a new alarm system to protect
them, two van Goghs and a Cezanne were back on public view Tuesday
evening, a day after the stolen paintings were recovered by police.
	   Custodians wearing white gloves carried the paintings, which
were stolen on May 19 by three masked gunmen, to their places on
the wall of a small room in Rome's National Gallery of Modern Art.
	   In raids on apartments in Rome and Turin, police before dawn
Monday arrested eight persons for the theft, including a museum
security official.
	   Van Gogh's ``The Gardener'' was found in a cardboard box under a
bed and Cezanne's ``The Cabin of Jourdan'' atop a wardrobe in one
of the Rome apartments. ``The Woman from Arles,'' another van Gogh,
had been stashed in a Turin apartment.
	   ``The Gardener'' and ``The Woman from Arles'' are Italy's only
two publicly displayed van Goghs and flank the Cezanne work in the
exhibit room.
	   Police reportedly were investigating the possibility that the
gang had made contacts with a potential buyer willing to pay big
money to possess the works clandestinely. The art, together worth
at least dlrs 30 million, was too famous to sell openly.

Top Nigerian political prisoner dead

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's most prominent political
prisoner, Moshood Abiola, died of a heart attack on Tuesday after
falling ill during a meeting with a visiting U.S. delegation, the
government said.
	   ``The federal government regrets to announce the sudden death of
Chief M.K.O. (Moshood) Abiola,'' a government statement said.
``Chief Abiola was taken ill during a meeting which was being held
by Nigerian and United States officials with him.''
	   The statement from the president's office said a full autopsy
would be performed, although the government said the cause of death
was cardiac arrest.
	   Abiola, 60, the West African country's top political prisoner,
was said to be close to release after the recent visit to Nigeria
of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   Abiola, the apparent winner of 1993's canceled presidential
elections, was jailed the following year and accused of treason by
dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, who died last month of a heart attack.
	   A U.S. delegation, led by Thomas Pickering, was in Nigeria to
meet with the new military leadership and lobby for the release of
political prisoners, including Abiola.
	   Abiola's family had repeatedly warned that his health had been
failing after years in detention under harsh conditions. His
fortune and personal life also suffered deeply during his
imprisonment. Two of his many wives died _ one in an
assassination-style slaying _ and his enormous business empire
largely collapsed.
	   Annan said after his visit that he met with Abiola and that the
opposition leader had decided to relinquish his claim to the
presidency and cooperate with Nigeria's junta in making a peaceful
transition to democracy. Many of his supporters, however, still
wanted to see him take office.
	   Nigeria became an international pariah under the rule of Abacha,
who took power following a coup in 1993.
	   Political jailings were rampant; between 250 and 280 people are
believed still held across Nigeria. All are kept in regular prisons
except for Abiola, who was detained in the relative comfort of a
government guest house in Abuja, the capital.
	   During Abacha's years in power, corruption tore away at
Nigeria's economy and its infrastructure, leaving both in shambles.
Despite the country's vast oil reserves, motorists line up and wait
for hours at the few gas stations that haven't run dry.

	   GSTAAD, Switzerland (AP) _ French Open finalist Alex Corretja
secured his place Tuesday in the rainy second round of the dlrs
560,000 Swiss Open.
	   Corretja, seeded third, took advantage of a brief respite from
the rain to defeat Germany's Oliver Gross 6-4, 4-6, 6-1.
	   In the day's only other completed match, Lucas Arnold of
Argentina beat hometown favorite Roger Federer, who won the
Wimbledon junior title on Sunday.
	   Arnold was a late replacement for Germany's Tommy Haas, who had
a bout of food poisoning.
	   Eighth-seed Nicolas Kiefer of Germany trailed Spain's Juan
Albert Viloca 5-0 before their match was washed out, while Spaniard
Julian Alonso was leading Nicolas Escude 6-2, 3-3. The matches will
resume Wednesday.

Parliament urges government to execute alleged bombers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Members of Sudan's Parliament urged the
government Tuesday to apply the death penalty according to Islamic
laws on those who allegedly planned a series of bombing in the
capital last week.
	   ``The executive should be very firm in implementing the Islamic
laws on those who carried out the criminal actions,'' the Sudan
news agency quoted one legislator, Yassin Omer Imam, as telling the
Parliament.
	   The government earlier this month accused opposition parties of
planting several bombs which were meant to go off on June 30 during
celebrations marking the ninth anniversary of the 1989 military
coup that brought President Omar el-Bashir to power.
	   Some bombs exploded prematurely without causing injuries and
others were defused.
	   Abdul-Basit Sabdaraty, an adviser to el-Bashir, said Tuesday
that more than 20 alleged perpetrators were arrested. Several
opposition politicians were also detained.
	   On Monday night, three of the arrested men appeared on Sudan's
state television to confess that the bombing campaign was planned
by the opposition National Democratic Alliance.
	   The NDA denied the accusation and said the government had
fabricated the story to discredit the opposition.
	   The accused shown on the television had apparently been beaten
by their captors: their eyes were swollen and their faces were
bruised.
	   The NDA is a grouping of northern and southern opposition
parties, including the southern Sudan Peoples' Liberation Army.
	   SPLA has been waging an insurrection since 1983, demanding
greater autonomy from the Islamic-dominated government for the
mainly Christian and animist south. More than 1.5 million Sudanese
have died in the fighting and consequent famines.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The General Assembly agreed Tuesday to
give the Palestinians U.N. rights and powers just short of those
granted member states, despite opposition from the United States,
which said the move would harm the peace process.
	   Israel dismissed its significance as ``a minor correction'' in
the status of the Palestinian observer mission and said the
Palestinian attempt to change its standing violated peace accords.
The Palestinians called the 124-4 vote a huge step toward a
declaration of statehood.
	   The Arab-sponsored resolution gives the Palestinian observer
mission a unique, nonvoting seat in the 185-member assembly.
	   With the new powers, Palestinian representatives can raise
issues of the peace process in the assembly, cosponsor draft
resolutions on Mideast peace, and reply on record to speeches made
at the world body. The representative cannot vote or put forward
candidates for U.N. committees, such as the Security Council.
	   More important, however, the vote affirmed international support
for Palestinians in the protracted Mideast peace process.
	   ``It is an admission of their legitimate rights and it
constitutes support for the peace process,'' Nabil Abourdeineh, a
senior aide to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, told The
Associated Press. ``It is a huge step toward the imminent
declaration of statehood.''
	   No other entity has the nonvoting status, and the move was a
blow to the United States, Israel's closest ally at the United
Nations.
	   Washington had argued against the new designation, saying any
U.N. action on Israel or the Palestinians could jeopardize its
efforts to restart peace talks which have been stalled since March
1997.
	   ``This is the wrong resolution at the wrong time,'' U.S.
Ambassador Bill Richardson told the assembly before the vote. ``It
will undermine our efforts to get the peace process back on track
and hurt everyone's interests, including those it most intended to
help.''
	   The United States, Israel, Micronesia and the Marshall Islands
voted against the resolution. Ten members abstained.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the vote ``a
minor correction,'' in the Palestinian status but said he was
``concerned with the actual attempt by the Palestinians to
predetermine their international status because this is a clear
violation of the Olso accords.''
	   Israel's U.N. ambassador, Dore Gold, also rejected the attempt
as a violation of peace accords but said it represented ``no
effective change of the status of the PLO in the U.N.''
	   Austria's ambassador, Ernst Suchairpa, speaking on behalf of the
European Union, said he voted for the resolution because of
consistent Palestinian complaints that there was no charter that
codified the rights of observers.
	   ``The rights and privileges have been indeed granted over the
decades on a case by case basis,'' he said. ``This resolution is
therefore not regarded by the European Union as a creating a
precedent.''
	   Because of the unique vote, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
was to report back to the assembly on how the Palestinians' new
rights would be implemented.

Volkswagen suspends production for one day to reduce stock of
</HEADLINE>
unsold cars &QL; 
 &UR; By STAN LEHMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ With a stock of 12,000 unsold vehicles,
Volkswagen's Brazilian subsidiary Tuesday said it will suspend
production for one day to ``adjust production to demand.''
	   ``And we cannot discard the possibility of a longer suspension
in the future if the market continues as sluggish as it is,'' said
Fran Augusti of the Volkswagen press office.
	   The company also canceled its plans to operate on July 18 and 25
so that workers could compensate for hours not worked during the
World Cup in France, Augusti said by phone.
	   ``The unworked hours will be compensated once demand picks up,''
he said.
	   He said the company's inventory of unsold cars was equivalent to
five days' worth of production.
	   Faced with a slump in domestic demand, Ford Motor Company's
Brazilian unit last week suspended operations at the largest of its
three assembly lines for seven working days. Italian automaker Fiat
also said it will halt production for 10 days beginning July 8, but
denied it was an effort to reduce its stock.
	   General Motors said it had no plans of reducing its output.
	   On Monday, Jose Carlos Pinheiro, president of the National
Association of Automobile Manufacturers, said that the sales and
production figures posted for the first half of the year were
``extremely worrisome'' and pointed to a ``very sluggish market.''
	   ``And there is no indication that this situation will change.''
	   During the first six months of the year, a total of 647,600
domestically produced vehicles _ passenger cars, trucks and buses _
were sold, or 23 percent less than the 845,000 units sold in the
same period in 1997.
	   Production in the first half of the year came to 877,000
vehicles for a 15 percent drop from the 1.03 million manufactured
in the same period of last year.
	   Domestic demand remains suppressed by the austerity measures
introduced late last year to counter the effects of the Asian
financial crisis on Brazil.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian government bonds took a nosedive Tuesday
and the stock markets continued to sink while officials pressed
ahead with appeals to the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank for new loans.
	   Interest rates on short-term government bonds shot up to 120
percent, from 90 percent on Monday, as the Central Bank failed to
intervene to bring down the soaring yields.
	   The stock market dropped 4.5 percent, despite assurances that
the government was getting closer to a bailout agreement with the
IMF. The ruble closed slightly lower against the U.S. dollar.
	   Anatoly Chubais, Russia's representative to international
lenders, met with officials of the IMF and the World Bank for two
hours. He said afterward the parties would meet again Thursday to
settle outstanding issues.
	   Russia is seeking a loan of at least dlrs 10 billion from the
IMF and other international lenders to stabilize its markets.
	   ``We wanted to resolve all principal issues in a tight time
frame, by the end of the week, and spend the next week on working
out practical problems,'' he said, according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   Chubais said Tuesday's talks were complicated.
	   ``There is understanding for Russia's tough position, but one
can't just lose heart, and the actions of the government must
stimulate growth,'' Chubais said.
	   Martin Gilman, the IMF's chief representative in Moscow, said
additional aid to Russia will depend on the government's
stabilization package, which is being considered by parliament,
ITAR-Tass said.

 &UR; Israeli ministers: Agreement on West Bank withdrawal soon
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES with fresh Netanyahu quotes, details, Jewish
cemetery vandalism in final graf; TRIMS; CHANGES Byline &QL; 
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
indicated he was close to accepting a deal on a long overdue West
Bank troop withdrawal but said nothing would happen unless the
Palestinians fulfill commitments made in previous accords.
	   Netanyahu has been under pressure from members of his own
coalition and the United States to accept an American proposal for
an Israeli troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank.
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has accepted the deal proposed in
January.
	   ``The gaps between the United States and Israel have been
reduced. Success is now dependent on the Palestinians fulfilling
their obligations in a concrete way (and) the fulfillment of these
obligations could bring an agreement soon,'' Netanyahu told
reporters.
	   Those obligations, Israel says, includes down-sizing the
Palestinian police force, cracking down on terrorism and removing
sections of the Palestinian charter which call for Israel's
destruction.
	   Earlier, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said a
redeployment deal could come within a few days but Netanyahu was
less specific.
	   ``I can't say if it is a matter of days, but we are approaching
it,'' he said.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said in an interview
with CNN on Monday that she had spoken ``intensively'' by telephone
with Netanyahu in recent days and that ``We are coming closer'' to
agreement.
	   ``But it is a very tough problem that requires a great deal of
patience,'' she added. ``We're all trying to be patient with it
while pushing forward to narrow the gaps.''
	   Netanyahu aide David Bar-Illan said the premier still hoped to
achieve a deal before the Knesset session ends Aug. 2, and that
discussions were underway ``all the time'' with the U.S.
administration.``It does look a little better now than it did a few
days ago,'' he said.
	   Netanyahu is also facing pressures from within his own Cabinet
to accept a deal or call new elections.
	   Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani said the agreement
would ``stand or fall'' during the month of July.
	   ``If there is no agreement, the prime minister will have to tell
the people of Israel the reasons why.''
	   Agriculture Minister Rafael Eitan, who opposes any West Bank
withdrawal and has said he will challenge the prime minister in the
next ballot, scheduled for 2000, joined a call for early national
elections.
	   ``It's better to go to the polls now, standing tall, and let the
nation decide, than to wait and squirm,'' he told The Associated
Press.
	   Meanwhile, in the Gaza Strip, tensions flared for the second
time in less than a week when Israeli settlers blocked a motorcade
of foreign diplomats and Palestinian officials for more than an
hour on a disputed coast road.
	   The convoy was arranged by the Palestinian Information Ministry
to explain a showdown that took place on the road Thursday, when
Israeli and Palestinian troops confronted each other with cocked
assault rifles and armored personnel carriers. The confrontation
began after Israeli soldiers blocked a convoy headed by a
Palestinian minister from using the road.
	   Most of Gaza is under Palestinian self-rule, but Israel
maintains control of key roads leading to Jewish settlements there.
Palestinian officials have accused Israel of violating the
Israel-Palestinian accords, which stipulate that ``Palestinians
will be free to move along the coast road.''
	   And at the Jewish cemetery in the divided West Bank city of
Hebron, vandals smashed a glass encasing of Torah scroll fragments
and police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said some of the fragments may
have been stolen.

Albanian militants forced to abandon village, Serbs report

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces shelled four villages
Tuesday in southern Kosovo, ethnic Albanian sources said. Serb
sources, meanwhile, said insurgents withdrew from a village where
two policemen were killed the previous day.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the ethnic Albanian
leadership, said the shelling occurred near the town of Djakovica,
about 15 kilometers (10 miles) northeast of the Albanian border.
	   According to the center, smoke could be seen billowing from the
villages but there was no report of casualties.
	   Earlier Tuesday, the Serb Media Center said the ethnic Albanian
Kosovo Liberation Army had pulled back from the village of Lodja,
where both sides had reported fighting the previous day.
	   Serb sources said two policemen were killed and nine others
wounded in Monday's fighting around Lodja. Ethnic Albanian sources
said late Tuesday three members of the Kosovo Liberation Army
killed in Lodja over the past two days, identifying them as officer
Lumni Surdulli, 29, and privates Rrustem Bruci, 40 and Enver Alaj,
33.
	   According to the Kosovo Information Center, 13 members of the
KLA were wounded in the clashes in Lodja, which they claim is
controlled by the militants, but surrounded and sealed off by Serb
forces. Twenty houses in Lodja were damaged in the fighting, the
center said.
	   Before the Albanians withdrew, Serb forces evacuated 11
civilians and two policemen overnight from the village, the Serb
Media Center said. Albanian sources said scattered fighting
persisted in the Lodja area Tuesday.
	   In the nearby city of Pec Tuesday, hundreds of grieving friends,
relatives and police officers buried the body of Mirko Radanavic,
36, Tuesday after he was shot in fighting in Lodja.
	   None of the reports could be independently confirmed because
telephone lines to the area have been cut and the main road sealed
off by Serb police.
	   In a separate report, center said KLA fighters released two
Serbs kidnapped several days ago and handed them over to the
International Red Cross, who confirmed the action.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo since Serb forces
launched a crackdown on ethnic Albanian extremists in late
February.
	   Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in the province, which
is part of Serbia. Serbia and Montenegro form the Yugoslav
federation.
	   The conflict has raised fears that the fighting could spread
elsewhere in the Balkans.
	   On Tuesday, the Albanian interior ministry reported that 20
Yugoslav soldiers crossed the border into Albania on Sunday but
withdrew about an hour later without incident.
	   There was no official comment from Yugoslavia.
	   Militant ethnic Albanians fighting for independence for Kosovo
province from the southern Yugoslav republic of Serbia have been
regrouping and arming themselves inside the Albanian border for
months.

Moshood Abiola: Opposition leader and Nigeria's top prisoner

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Moshood Abiola had been a publisher, a
shipping tycoon, a philanthropist and Nigeria's most famous
political prisoner. He also should have been his country's
president.
	   Abiola, once a close friend of Nigeria's military leaders, was
jailed in 1994 after he marked the one-year anniversary of
nullified elections he is thought to have won by declaring himself
president.
	   He died Tuesday at age 60 after becoming ill during a meeting
with U.S. officials visiting to discuss freedom for all of
Nigeria's political prisoners, which total at least 250. The
Nigerian government said he died of a heart attack.
	   Abiola's election victory had thrilled Nigeria, which was
supposed to see an end to military rule with the vote.
	   But the jubilation turned to anger when Nigeria's then-military
ruler, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, refused to accept the outcome,
provoking riots that sent the country spiraling down into chaos.
	   The instability cleared the way for Babangida's No. 1 man, Gen.
Sani Abacha, to seize power in a bloodless coup that November.
Seven months later he arrested Abiola on treason charges for
declaring himself president in defiance of the military government.
	   ``Abacha and his people are engaged in a one-way jamboree in a
futile effort to hang onto power,'' Abiola said at the time.
	   But Abacha is no longer a concern. The dictator died in early
June, apparently of a heart attack.
	   His successor, former chief of defense staff Gen. Abdulsalam
Abubakar, appears to want to have little to do with his
predecessor's policies. In just a few weeks he has freed dozens of
political prisoners, met with prominent foreign delegations and
vowed to hand over power to civilian rule.
	   He reportedly met with Abiola just hours after he came to power
in the wake of Abacha's death.
	   After visiting Nigeria earlier this month, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Abubakar had promised to free all
political prisoners soon, including Abiola.
	   Abiola won international attention in 1992 when he began a
campaign to get the United States and former European colonizers of
Africa to pay reparations to the continent for slavery and for
fortunes made from exporting raw materials.
	   In 1993, he won the presidential nomination of the Social
Democratic Party, trading on his rags-to-riches story, his
extensive philanthropy and promises to end poverty within six
months of assuming office.
	   Unofficial results after the vote showed him with a commanding
lead, but Babangida declared the election void before the outcome
was declared official.
	   The military ruler feared that a victory for Abiola, a member of
the southern Yoruba tribe, would threaten the northerners who have
long dominated Nigeria's military and politics.
	   Abiola grew up in a poor family, attended the University of
Glasgow in Scotland on a scholarship and graduated with a degree in
economic. His fortune reached from publishing to shipping to oil,
but he said his first serious income came when he worked for the
International Telephone and Telegraph Corp., serving as a vice
president and chairman for Africa and the Middle East from 1971 to
1988.
	   Some Nigerians blamed him for the country's appalling telephone
system, saying he made millions _ as many have in this
corruption-ridden country _ by using inferior materials and
pocketing the extra money. These days, just calling across Lagos
can be impossible on many days. Abiola has denied the accusations.
	   His long prison stay is said to have devastated his empire, with
many of his businesses struggling to survive.
	   Abiola's personal life kept him in the public eye before he got
into politics. In 1992, a New Jersey judge ordered him to pay dlrs
20,000 a month in child support to a woman who said she was his
wife. Abiola's lawyers argued he had four wives _ and that the
woman in question was just one of his 19 concubines.
	   His biography in Who's Who in Nigeria notes only that he ``has
many children.''
	   One of his wives, Kudirat, was gunned down in 1996 in a roadside
ambush that also killed her driver.
	   Opponents of the Abacha regime said the government was to blame
for the assassination-style killing. Police said it was a result of
a family feud.
	   Mrs. Abiola's outspoken criticism of the Abacha regime was a
source of friction in the extended Abiola clan.

	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu
Kyi was stopped by authorities Tuesday evening 80 kilometers (50
miles) north of Yangon and has refused to leave her car or return
home, official sources said Tuesday.
	   Mrs. Suu Kyi's trip appeared designed to flout a strict though
unofficial ban on her traveling outside of the capital and seemed
likely to escalate tensions between the military government and
Mrs. Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy.
	   A statement issued Tuesday night by the military government said
that Mrs. Suu Kyi, head of the National League for Democracy,
accompanied by party chairman Aung Shwe, another party official and
their driver, ``were stopped by the local security officials at
Shwe Mya Yar village.''
	   The statement said the local officials noticed that the
government security personnel who always accompany Suu Kyi on her
rare and closely-guarded trips outside her house were absent.
	   They asked her group not to proceed with their trip to Min Hla
Township, 147 kilometers (92 miles) north of Yangon. The statement
did not say why the group was heading to Min Hla.
	   The reported absence of the security team seemed to suggest that
Suu Kyi may have managed to sneak away from her closely-guarded
residence, where she was held under house arrest without trial from
1989 to 1995.
	   A military official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
that Suu Kyi's group remained at the spot as late as midnight
Tuesday.
	   The incident comes a time of heightened confrontation between
the military regime in Myanmar _ also called Burma _ and Suu Kyi's
opposition National League for Democracy, which recently demanded
that the military seat the winners of a 1990 general election. The
league won a sweeping victory in the polls.
	   A commentary in the state-controlled press last week suggested
that Suu Kyi _ the winner of the 1991 Nobel peace prize _ could
face a long prison term for her political activities.
	   The commentary also warned that she could become another Ngo
Dinh Diem, the premier of South Vietnam who was assassinated by
military officers in 1963. The warning was widely seen as a threat
to her life.
	   The reference caused concern because of a June 25 incident in
which unidentified men assaulted members of the youth wing of Suu
Kyi's party outside her home after police tried to block them from
holding a regularly scheduled meeting.
	   Suu Kyi reportedly fell or was pushed to the ground during the
melee, and held an overnight sit-in on the street with the party
youths afterwards.
	   Tuesday's official statement said Suu Kyi's group were asked to
return to the capital ``after permission to proceed was denied ...
on grounds of security and prevention as well as the making of
unnecessary political agitation and activities intending to create
a head-on collision and confrontation with the relevant authorities
in an attempt to bring about social unrest and political
disturbances.''
	   The statement also noted that Tuesday was the anniversary of a
government crackdown on students in 1962 who were protesting
military rule. Several students died in the confrontation at the
country's main university in the capital, and the government blew
up the student union, which it saw as the hub of rebellion.
	   ``It is regretful that the NLD leadership has deliberately
chosen the occasion to create unnecessary and unwanted confusion,
confrontation and collision and thereby to threaten the disruption
of the prevailing peace, tranquility and stability at any cost,''
it said.
	   It also accused the media and some foreign embassies in Yangon
of taking part in ``a fabrication and disinformation campaign ...
to mislead the world into thinking that an internal revolution and
ethnic uprising are imminently brewing in Myanmar.''
	   The military regime has been widely criticized by human rights
groups and Western governments for human rights abuses and its
failure to move towards democracy.
	   Suu Kyi has made few trips outside the capital since she was
released from house arrest in 1995, and none recently. She is
generally allowed to make visits to small groups of close friends
or associates in the capital, but not to meet with even modest
crowds of her supporters. Access to her home is also strictly
controlled.

	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's most prominent political
prisoner, Moshood Abiola, died of a heart attack Tuesday after
falling ill during a meeting with a visiting U.S. delegation, the
government said. He was 60.
	   Abiola was the apparent winner of 1993 presidential elections
canceled by then-dictator Gen. Sani Abacha. He was jailed the
following year and accused of treason by Abacha, who died last
month of a heart attack. Abacha's five-year dictatorship made
Nigeria an international pariah.
	   The country's new military leader, Abdulsalam Abubakar, had
reportedly been close to releasing Abiola. The apparent heart
attack that claimed the former businessman's life struck during a
meeting with a U.S. State Department delegation led by Thomas
Pickering, who was lobbying for Abiola's release.
	   A government statement issued in the capital, Abuja, said
Abiola's death was sudden, but gave few details.
	   ``The federal government regrets to announce the sudden death of
Chief M.K.O. (Moshood) Abiola,'' the statement said. ``Chief Abiola
was taken ill during a meeting which was being held by Nigerian and
United States officials with him.''
	   The president's office said a full autopsy would be performed,
although the government said the cause of death was cardiac arrest.
	   The stunning news was the latest in a turbulent four weeks in
Nigeria, first with the death of Abacha and now with that of his
primary political foe.
	   Abiola, once an ally of Nigeria's all-powerful military, fell
out of favor with Abacha in 1993 after winning the presidential
elections.
	   Abacha annulled the results, seized power and dissolved most
working government bodies.
	   When Abiola reasserted his claim to the presidency the following
year, Abacha had him imprisoned on treason charges.
	   Jailed and in failing health ever since, Abiola was said to be
close to release this month following the visit to Nigeria of U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   The U.S. delegation was in Nigeria to meet with the new military
leadership and lobby for the release of political prisoners,
including Abiola.
	   Abiola's family had repeatedly warned that his health had been
failing after years in detention under harsh conditions. His
fortune and personal life also suffered deeply during his
imprisonment. Two of his many wives died _ one in an
assassination-style slaying _ and his enormous business empire
largely collapsed.
	   Annan said he had met with Abiola and that the opposition leader
had decided to relinquish his claim to the presidency and cooperate
with Nigeria's junta in making a peaceful transition to democracy.
Many of his supporters, however, still wanted to see him take
office.
	   Nigeria became an international pariah under the rule of Abacha,
who took power following a coup in 1993.
	   Political jailings were rampant; between 250 and 280 people are
believed still held across Nigeria. All are kept in regular prisons
except for Abiola, who was detained in the relative comfort of a
government guest house in Abuja.
	   During Abacha's years in power, corruption left Nigeria's
economy and infrastructure in shambles. Despite the country's vast
oil reserves, motorists line up and wait for hours at the few gas
stations that haven't run dry.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces shelled four villages
Tuesday in southern Kosovo, ethnic Albanian sources said. Serb
sources, meanwhile, said insurgents withdrew from a village where
two policemen were killed the previous day.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the ethnic Albanian
leadership, said the shelling occurred near the town of Djakovica,
about 15 kilometers (10 miles) northeast of the Albanian border.
	   The center said smoke could be seen billowing from the villages
but there was no report of casualties.
	   Earlier Tuesday, the Serb Media Center had the ethnic Albanian
Kosovo Liberation Army had pulled back from the village of Lodja,
where both sides had reported fighting the previous day.
	   Serb sources said two policemen were killed and nine others
wounded in Monday's fighting around Lodja. Ethnic Albanian sources
said late Tuesday three members of the KLA had been killed in Lodja
over the past two days.
	   The Kosovo center said 13 KLA members were wounded in the
clashes in Lodja, which they claim is controlled by the militants.
The center reported the city was surrounded and sealed off by Serb
forces. Twenty houses in Lodja were damaged in the fighting, the
center said.
	   Before the Albanians withdrew, Serb forces evacuated 11
civilians and two policemen overnight from the village, the Serb
center said. Albanian sources said scattered fighting persisted in
the Lodja area Tuesday.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo since Serb forces
launched a crackdown on ethnic Albanian extremists in late
February.
	   Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in the province, which
is part of Serbia. Serbia and Montenegro form the Yugoslav
federation.
	   The conflict has raised fears that the fighting could spread
elsewhere in the Balkans.
	   None of the reports could be independently confirmed because
telephone lines to the area have been cut and the main road sealed
off by Serb police.
	   On Tuesday, the Albanian interior ministry reported that 20
Yugoslav soldiers crossed the border into Albania on Sunday but
withdrew about an hour later without incident.
	   There was no official comment from Yugoslavia.
	   Militant ethnic Albanians fighting for independence for Kosovo
province from the southern Yugoslav republic of Serbia have been
regrouping and arming themselves inside the Albanian border for
months.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia launched the world's first satellite into
space Tuesday using a missile fired from a submarine.
	   The German Tubsat-N satellite was put into orbit by a RSM-54
intercontinental ballistic missile fired by a Novomoskovsk
submarine in the Barents Sea, Russian news reports said, quoting
navy officials.
	   Russian officials said it was the Navy's first commercial space
launch. But U.S. space analysts said it was the first time any
nation had launched a satellite into orbit from a submarine.
	   The launch was made while the sub was submerged, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported, and TV footage showed the rocket firing out
of the ocean and into the sky.
	   The 10-kilogram (22-pound) satellite, developed by the Berlin
Technical University, will provide communication services and also
help count animals and relay other ecological information, the
reports said.
	   The RSM-54 missile, which is called SS-N-23 in the West, is a
standard weapon of Russian nuclear-powered submarines.
	   The U.S. Navy has used submarines to launch sub-orbital rockets
for delivery of bombs or weapons, but has not launched satellites
into orbit.

World Cup: Dutch have better of half as semifinal goes goalless
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Patrick Kluivert missed the best chance
of the half when he drove a header from six meters just over the
bar in the 29th minute, leaving the Netherlands and Brazil goalless
at halftime of their World Cup semifinal Tuesday night.
	   The Dutch came out quickly and controlled the first 10 minutes
before the Brazilians settled down and then did the same for the
second 10. But as the half drew to a close, the Dutch again had
reasserted control.
	   The Dutch were trying to reach the final for the first time
since 1978 and the Brazilians were hoping to for a chance to defend
their title and win a record fifth crown.
	   Kluivert's header came as the Dutch began to retake the
momentum. Boudewijn Zenden, making only his seventh appearance for
the Oranje due to the absence of the hamstring-hampered Marc
Overmars, continually exploited the inexperience of Brazil's left
flank.
	   Twice he sent in dangerous crosses, including the one to
Kluivert, that were headed high, and caused repeated problems for
Ze Carlos, making his national team debut due to the suspension of
Cafu.
	   Brazil's best chance in the 16th minute when Dutch defender Jaap
Stam had to race back and make a sliding block of a shot by Ronaldo
just inside the six-yard box.
	   Both sides had to shuffle their lineups due to suspensions and
injuries. The Dutch were missing Arthur Numan due to his two-yellow
card ejection against Argentina, and his expected replacement,
Winston Bogarde, was out after fracturing his fibula in training on
Sunday.
	   Phillip Cocu was forced into a marking back role while Zenden
took over for Overmars, who was available if needed.
	   Brazil's defense had been noted as the suspect element of the
defending champion's roster and the loss of Cafu made it even more
questionable.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The General Assembly agreed Tuesday to
give the Palestinians U.N. rights and powers just short of those
granted member states, despite opposition from the United States,
which said the move would harm the peace process.
	   Israel dismissed its significance as ``a minor correction'' in
the status of the Palestinian observer mission and said the
Palestinian attempt to change its standing violated peace accords.
The Palestinians called the 124-4 vote a huge step toward a
declaration of statehood.
	   The Arab-sponsored resolution gives the Palestinian observer
mission a unique, nonvoting seat in the 185-member assembly.
	   With the new powers, Palestinian representatives can raise
issues of the peace process in the assembly, cosponsor draft
resolutions on Mideast peace, and reply on record to speeches made
at the world body. The representative cannot vote or put forward
candidates for U.N. committees, such as the Security Council.
	   More important, however, the vote affirmed international support
for Palestinians in the protracted Mideast peace process.
	   ``It is an admission of their legitimate rights and it
constitutes support for the peace process,'' Nabil Abourdeineh, a
senior aide to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, told The
Associated Press. ``It is a huge step toward the imminent
declaration of statehood.''
	   No other entity has the nonvoting status, and the move was a
blow to the United States, Israel's closest ally at the United
Nations.
	   Washington had argued against the new designation, saying any
U.N. action on Israel or the Palestinians could jeopardize its
efforts to restart peace talks which have been stalled since March
1997.
	   ``This is the wrong resolution at the wrong time,'' U.S.
Ambassador Bill Richardson told the assembly before the vote. ``It
will undermine our efforts to get the peace process back on track
and hurt everyone's interests, including those it most intended to
help.''
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin called
the vote an unnecessary and untimely mistake. ``And it may be a
symbolic victory for some, but it makes it harder to prevent the
two sides from not taking unilateral actions that can harm the
peace process,'' he said.

Ex-premier convicted in bribery case
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: AMS. RECASTS; UPDATES with lawyers saying they'll appeal;
sentence likely to be suspended under new law &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Media mogul and former Premier Silvio
Berlusconi on Tuesday received his second conviction for
corruption, this time with a prison sentence of two years and nine
months.
	   Berlusconi was convicted of bribing tax inspectors to obtain
favorable audits of his Fininvest media and retail holding company.
	   It was little likely, however, that Berlusconi, who now heads
the center-right opposition, was about to go to jail following the
verdict of the Milan court after a 2 1-2 year-long trial. Under a
new law, sentences under three years are eligible for suspension.
	   ``It's a sentence which seems tailor-made to the (new) law, that
is, right under the limit of three years to avoid the risk of
prison for the leader of the opposition,'' said Alfonso Pecoraro
Scanio, a Greens party deputy.
	   In any case, Italian prison sentences rarely begin being served
until after the second appeal, a process which can take several
years. Berlusconi's lawyers said they would appeal.
	   The defense argued that the money was extorted by the
inspectors.
	   Berlusconi he is a victim of a vendetta by Milan prosecutors he
sees as left-leaning.
	   It was the second guilty verdict for Berlusconi, who was
convicted in December of fraud in a 1987 film company deal and
given a 16-month suspended sentence.
	   ``When you use the weapon of political trials to eliminate the
democratic opposition, you're not in a democracy any more, you're
in a regime,'' Berlusconi, who skipped the trial session, said in a
faxed statement.
	   The ex-premier faces charges of tax evasion and tax fraud in
other cases.
	   Prosecutors in this case had asked for conviction and a
three-year prison term for the media magnate and conviction and a
two-year-four month term for the ex-premier's brother, Paolo
Berlusconi, who was a company official.
	   The court acquitted Paolo Berlusconi as well an inspector, who
belongs to Italy's paramilitary tax police.
	   Also convicted and sentenced to jail terms ranging from 10
months to 2 1-2 years were three Fininvest officials or
consultants. Three tax police officials were also convicted and
sentenced to terms ranging from two to three years.
	   The Berlusconi media empire includes Italy's three largest
private TV networks.
	   This case grew out of the ``Clean Hands'' corruption probes
begun in Milan in 1992. The kickback probes brought down an entire
political class.

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Like any good talk show host, Magic Johnson
introduced his latest guest _ a 6-inch (15-cm) tropical millipede
that wrapped itself around his index finger.
	   ``This is my new ring, y'all,'' the smiling host told a cheering
audience at ``The Magic Hour.''
	   A moment later, Johnson's aversion to crawling things suddenly
kicked in. He flicked his wrist and sent the critter flying. The
audience roared.
	   ``It freaked me out,'' Johnson said.
	   That was just the sort of spontaneity the basketball great and
his producers want. Since the show's beginning five weeks ago,
``The Magic Hour'' has been battered by low ratings and bad
reviews. Johnson has been criticized for being stiff on camera and
a weak interviewer.
	   After four weeks, the format was revised to eliminate the
standup comedy routine and move more quickly to the guests. Johnson
is trying to use cue cards less and ad-lib more.
	   He is determined to make this venture succeed, the way most of
his projects do.
	   His National Basketball Association career initially ended in
1991 after he contracted the AIDS virus. Since then, Johnson has
made a practice of reinventing himself _ AIDS activist, coach,
comeback player.
	   In his latest incarnation as talk show host, Johnson is
struggling. But even if ``The Magic Hour'' fails, Johnson has
enough going to keep him very busy, and very wealthy.
	   He has a net worth well over dlrs 100 million. He said by the
end of 1999, he would be in control of property worth as much as
dlrs 400 million.
	   Magic Johnson Entertainment has a deal to produce two feature
films: a hip-hop comedy and a drama set in Louisiana during the era
of segregation.
	   But the heart of Johnson's business empire is a project designed
to bring top entertainment and retailing operations to inner
cities.
	   Magic Johnson Enterprises and its subsidiary, Johnson
Development Corp., act as a liaison between corporate America and
minority communities.
	   His venture with Loews Cineplex Entertainment, America's largest
movie chain, has produced some top-grossing movie houses. He has
aligned with Starbucks and the TGIF restaurant chain to open
outlets in major urban areas. And there is his plan to develop
inner-city shopping centers.
	   ``The suburbs are built up,'' Johnson said. ``Businesses that
want to grow, the only place they can grow is in the inner city. We
know how to put it together, how to run it.''
	   ``There are things that we know that they don't know. You've got
to know what inner-city people like and don't like.''
	   What Johnson and partner Ken Lombard offer is a share of the
investment capital, carefully scouted locations and expertise in
minority markets.
	   Right now, however, ``The Magic Hour'' is Johnson's top
priority. He keeps close tabs on his business ventures but has
turned over day-to-day operations to Lombard.
	   Johnson's health remains good, thanks in part to his strict
regimen of exercise and medication to keep the AIDS virus in check,
and a typical day reflects that.
	   By 6:30 a.m., he's making business calls and reviewing his
schedule with aides. At 7:30, he's lifting weights or riding a
stationary bike at the gym, followed by an hour or more of
basketball at UCLA. By 10:30, he's at the Paramount studio, working
on the evening's show. At 7 p.m., he heads home.
	   Despite the reviews, Johnson is optimistic about the show.
	   ``I think in the beginning, I was scared and nervous,'' he said.
``I'm making it my show now.''

	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's most prominent political
prisoner, Moshood Abiola, died of a heart attack Tuesday after
falling ill during a meeting with a visiting U.S. delegation, the
government said. He was 60.
	   Abiola was the apparent winner of 1993 presidential elections
canceled by then-dictator Gen. Sani Abacha. He was jailed the
following year and accused of treason by Abacha, who died last
month of a heart attack. Abacha's five-year dictatorship made
Nigeria an international pariah.
	   The country's new military leader, Abdulsalam Abubakar, had
reportedly been close to releasing Abiola. The apparent heart
attack struck during a meeting with a U.S. State Department
delegation led by Thomas Pickering, a former U.S. ambassador to
Nigeria, who was lobbying for Abiola's release.
	   Abiola was rushed from the meeting and taken to a hospital in
Abuja, said a western diplomat in Nigeria, who was also speaking on
the condition he not be identified.
	   In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton said the delegation
accompanied Abiola to the hospital, ``and witnessed physicians at
the State House clinic work to try to save Chief Abiola.
	   A Nigerian government statement issued in the capital, Abuja,
said Abiola's death was sudden, but gave few details.
	   ``The federal government regrets to announce the sudden death of
Chief M.K.O. (Moshood) Abiola,'' the statement said. ``Chief Abiola
was taken ill during a meeting which was being held by Nigerian and
United States officials with him.''
	   The president's office said a full autopsy would be performed,
although the government said the cause of death was cardiac arrest.
	   The stunning news was the latest in a turbulent four weeks in
Nigeria, first with the death of Abacha and now with that of his
primary political foe.
	   An unlikely hero for democracy, Abiola became a rallying point
for Nigeria's disparate opposition groups during his years of
imprisonment.
	   Grief and sorrow swept across the country as news of his death
spread among his supporters.
	   ``It's shocking,'' said Roman Catholic Archbishop of Lagos
Anthony Okogie. ``His death is the end of a chapter.''

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Media mogul and former Premier Silvio
Berlusconi on Tuesday received his second conviction for
corruption, this time with a prison sentence of two years and nine
months.
	   Berlusconi was convicted of bribing tax inspectors to obtain
favorable audits of his Fininvest media and retail holding company.
	   It was little likely, however, that Berlusconi, who heads the
center-right opposition, was going to jail following the verdict of
the Milan court after a 2 1-2 year-long trial. Under a new law,
sentences under three years are eligible for suspension.
	   ``It's a sentence which seems tailor-made to the (new) law, that
is, right under the limit of three years to avoid the risk of
prison for the leader of the opposition,'' said Alfonso Pecoraro
Scanio, a Greens party deputy.
	   In any case, Italian prison sentences rarely begin being served
until after the second appeal, a process which can take several
years. Berlusconi's lawyers said they would appeal.
	   The defense argued that the money was extorted by the
inspectors.
	   Berlusconi insists is a victim of a vendetta by Milan
prosecutors he sees as left-leaning.

Shock at death of top Nigerian political prisoner; opponents blame
</HEADLINE>
military regime &QL; 
 &UR; With Nigeria-Abiola

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain on Tuesday hailed Nigeria's most prominent
political prisoner, Moshood Abiola, as Nigeria's ``symbol of
democracy'' and said his death was particularly tragic at a time of
hope.
	   Opposition groups blamed his death on ill-treatment during four
years in jail and harassment by Nigeria's military regime.
	   In New York, U.N. Secretary-general Kofi Annan, who met with
Abiola just a week ago and who expected his imminent release from
jail, said he was deeply shocked.
	   Annan called on Nigeria's new military leader, Gen. Abdulsalam
Abubakar, to fulfill promises ``to release all remaining political
prisoners unconditionally and to define a credible process for the
democratic transition to civilian rule within a reasonable
period.''
	   News that Abiola, presumed winner of 1993 elections, suffered an
apparent heart attack while meeting a visiting U.S. State
Department delegation stunned Nigerian opposition groups.
	   In a statement, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook expressed
``deepest sympathy to his family and to the people of Nigeria at
this time.''
	   ``Chief Abiola had become the symbol of democracy in Nigeria,''
Cook added. ``It is therefore particularly tragic that he should
die now at this time of change and hope for Nigeria.''
	   While Annan said Abiola had seemed in good health when they met,
the London spokesman for a coalition of opposition groups said
Abiola's health had been deteriorating for a long time.
	   Bolaji Akinyemi, a Nigerian former foreign minister who is now
spokesman for the National Democratic Coalition of Nigeria, urged a
delay in burial for a team of World Health Organization doctors to
perform an autopsy.
	   ``... The last four years of his life, the blows that he
suffered, the assassination of his wife, the physical abuse in jail
_ probably part of which has contributed to this cardiac arrest _
have to me made him a martyr in African politics,'' said Akinyemi
in an interview with Britain's Channel 4 TV network.
	   Akinyemi, foreign minister from 1985-87, said Abiola was the
only politician since Nigeria's independence from Britain in 1960
who bridged the divide between north and south, Christians and
Muslims, rich and poor.
	   '' People from all over the country voted for this man. Nigeria
has lost its best hope in many, many years,'' said Akinyemi.
	   At the U.N. headquarters in New York, Nigeria's ambassador,
Ibrahim A. Gambari, urged Nigerians and others not to rush to
judgment but to wait for the results of an autopsy that he said
would be performed in the presence of Abiola's personal doctor and
family.

	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Sequestered for four years, imprisoned at
the whim of a military dictator, Nigeria's most prominent political
prisoner, Moshood Abiola, died Tuesday even as his supporters
prepared for his anticipated release.
	   Doctors plan a full autopsy to formally determine the cause of
death, but the government has said he died of a heart attack.
Abiola was 60.
	   Abiola was the apparent winner of 1993 presidential elections
canceled by then-dictator Gen. Sani Abacha. He was jailed the
following year and accused of treason by Abacha, who died last

Nigeria an international pariah.
	   Abiola's death Tuesday came on the same day Nigeria completed a
30-day official period of mourning for Abacha.
	   Abiola fell ill Tuesday during a meeting with a visiting U.S.
Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering.
	   ``We all helped to put him in a car, there was no ambulance
immediately available,'' Pickering said of Abiola's sudden illness
	   Speaking on CNN, Pickering said Abiola became ill in the early
stages of their meeting and asked for a doctor.
	   The country's new military leader, Abdulsalam Abubakar, had
reportedly been close to releasing Abiola.
	   Abiola was rushed from the meeting and taken to a hospital in

Se Ri Pak: on course for greatness
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ARNIE STAPLETON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KOHLER, Wisconsin (AP) _ When she turned pro at 18, Se Ri Pak
wanted to become the best woman golfer on the planet.
	   She's no doubt the most celebrated at the moment following her
U.S. Women's Open victory in a stirring 20-hole playoff against
amateur Jenny Chuasiriporn of Duke.
	   Pak, a rookie on the LPGA tour, doesn't consider herself the
best, not even after winning her second straight major on Monday.
	   ``No, not yet,'' said the shy 20-year-old South Korean who won
the McDonald's LPGA Championship in May. ``I have many years left.
I am just starting.
	   ``But,'' she added with a rare smile, ``I have a good start.''
	   Does she ever.
	   Pak became the youngest winner in 53 editions of the U.S.
Women's Open when she sank an 18-foot (5 1/2-meter) birdie putt on
the second hole of a sudden-death playoff at rugged Blackwolf Run.
	   Because Chuasiriporn is an amateur and ineligible to win any
prize money, Pak had already pocketed the dlrs 267,500 first-place
check when she and Chuasiriporn, a Thai-American from Maryland,
tied at 6-over-par 290 on Sunday.
	   So the playoff wasn't about pay, but pride.
	   And Pak never lost her cool when she fell behind by four strokes
after just five holes, eventually tying Chuasiriporn at 2-over
through 18 exhilarating holes.
	   Pak, who might be closer than she thinks to becoming the world's
best, joined Patty Berg as the only women to win two major
championships before their 21st birthdays.
	   Before Pak, the youngest Open winner was amateur Catherine
LaCoste, who was 22 when she won in 1967.
	   ``I'm really surprised because this is my first year,'' Pak
said. ``The first time I won a major, my sponsor (Samsung) and
everyone was surprised. Now, I win a second major, maybe my sponsor
gives me more money.''
	   When the laughter died down, Pak pointed to the sparkling trophy
next to her.
	   ``I don't want a check,'' she said. ``I want the trophy.''
	   On Tuesday, Samsung said it planned to launch a new sportswear
brand _ SERIPAK.
	   Pak hasn't returned to South Korea since moving to Orlando,
Fla., last summer, but she's become a national hero in her
homeland, where red and yellow banner newspaper headlines Tuesday
proclaimed Se Ri Pak ``Our Hope, Our Encouragement.''
	   From President Kim Dae-jung on down, South Koreans rejoiced over
Pak's triumph.
	   With their once robust economy in shambles, their World Cup
soccer team eliminated after one round, South Koreans badly needed
a boost _ and Pak delivered.
	   Millions of South Koreans stayed up through the night to watch
on television as Pak won the biggest tournament in women's golf.
	   ``With all the Korean people, I express my joy over your
victory,'' the president said in a congratulatory telegram. He
called her ``a hero of this era and our hope.''
	   Pak is trying to keep some perspective. But she did say her Open
victory legitimized her decision to join the LPGA tour after
competing in the Korean LPGA in 1996 and '97, where she won six
events and finished second seven times in just 14 tournaments.
	   She won the LPGA qualifying tournament last fall and then made
her splash in America by winning the LPGA Championship at Rockland,
Del., two months ago.
	   ``The first time I won, maybe people think I'm lucky,'' Pak
said. ``So, then I win U.S. Open. Now, maybe people think I'm not
lucky. That is why I'm really happy.''

	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Taffarel stopped both Phillip Cocu and
Ronald de Boer and Brazil defeated the Netherlands 4-2 on penalty
kicks Tuesday night to reach the final and a chance at a fifth
World Cup title.
	   The Brazilian keeper dove to his right to stop Cocu and then to
his left to deny de Boer on consecutive penalty tries to clinch the
victory after the two countries fought to a 1-1 draw in extra time.
	   The victory puts the defending champion into its sixth final on
Sunday against the winner of Wednesday night's other semifinal
between host France and upstart Croatia.

Judge sends jury home, calls lawyers to meet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Jurors in the second trial of wire-haired boxing
promoter Don King were sent home early Tuesday after one suggested
they couldn't reach a verdict, the judge said. Deliberations were
to resume Wednesday morning.
	   The juror sent a note to U.S. District Judge Lawrence McKenna
saying the panel ``doesn't think we can reach a verdict. One juror
is absolutely concrete in his belief and will not change his
vote.''
	   King is on trial for the second time on charges that he faked a
contract to cheat Lloyd's of London out of dlrs 350,000. The first
trial, in 1995, ended in a hung jury.
	   McKenna also announced from the bench that a second juror had
admitted having read a news report saying the maximum penalty King
faced was 45 years. Jurors have been told repeatedly not to read or
watch news reports about the trial.
	   The judge did not say what impact the two reports might have on
the trial's future, but called a meeting with lawyers early
Wednesday before jurors resume deliberations. The jury has been
deliberating for two days.
	   Prosecutors allege that King sent a fake contract to Lloyd's to
qualify for an extra dlrs 350,000 after a 1991 bout between Cesar
Chavez and Harold Brazier was canceled when Chavez was injured
while sparring.
	   Defense lawyers contend the government is waging a vindictive
crusade against King, a successful but controversial figure in
American boxing for 30 years.

	   The penalty kick shootout seemed an almost anti-climatic ending
to a match that saw repeated chances and a late goal by the Dutch
to send the game into extra time.
	   Patrick Kluivert forced the extra 30 minutes with a goal in the
87th minute, finally putting one of his repeated headers on target.
De Boer sent a cross from the right, and Kluivert drove the ball
down from six meters that beat Taffarel to his left.
	   Both sides had several chances in the extra period that could
have ended it.
	   The Brazilians had the opportunities early, with Frank de Boer
clearing a Ronaldo scisscors kick off the line with a header and
Dutch keeper Edwin van der Sar in the 94th and diving to block
Ronaldo from 20 meters less than a minute later.
	   The Netherlands had their chance when Kluivert sent a slow
roller just wide of the right post iin the 103rd.

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ A U.S. Army helicopter assigned to anti-drug duty
crashed on a Bahamian island during a maintenance flight, killing
the wives of two servicemen, injuring all three crew members and
raising questions about why the women were aboard.
	   It appeared the women's presence on the aircraft violated Army
regulations. An Army spokesman in Washington confirmed that only
the minimum flight crew is allowed on maintenance flights intended
to check repairs.
	   ``They've got to find out what in the world the wives were doing
on an Army aircraft,'' said the Army spokesman who asked that his
name not be used. ``The fact that they're civilians is the issue.''
	   Asked about the crash, Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said
specific authorization is required for civilian passengers, but he
referred questions about the Bahamian flight to the Army.
	   The women were listed on the flight manifest for the UH-60
Blackhawk based at Fort Stewart, Georgia, said U.S. Southern
Command spokesman Raul Duany in Miami. He could not say why the
women were on board.
	   The aviation section of Southern Command is assigned
responsibility for civilian passengers in its region, but no travel
request for the women was on file, Duany said.
	   Civilians are allowed to fly for diplomatic reasons or other
special events, but there was no indication of anything special in
this case.
	   Observance of military flight rules has been under scrutiny
since a Marine jet clipped a ski gondola cable and killed 20 people
in Italy on Feb. 3.
	   The helicopter was temporarily assigned to a U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration mission in the Bahamas, putting it under
the command of Southern Command rather than its home base.
	   The crash Monday evening triggered two investigations, one by
the U.S. Army Safety Center based at Fort Rucker, Alabama, which
investigates all Army crashes, and a collateral investigation to be
run by a colonel or higher-ranking officer to examine the aviators'
actions.
	   Nearly a day after the crash, there were conflicting reports on
whether the helicopter was taking off or landing when it went down.
	   ``The helicopter was totally lost, totally broken,'' said Milton
Strachan Jr., a fuel aviation company owner who watched the rescue
near George Town airport on Great Exuma Island.
	   A Bahamian police spokesman said the helicopter was taking off
when it crashed into brush about a quarter-mile from the runway.
U.S. Coast Guard spokesman Jeff Murphy in Miami said the helicopter
landed hard on the runway and then skidded off.
	   Troops took nearly three hours to reach the site and remove one
of the women trapped inside, Strachan said.
	   The helicopter was assigned to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency,
but spokeswoman Pam Brown in Miami said the flight was not an
anti-drug mission.
	   Nonmilitary passengers normally are required to sign liability
release forms on so-called goodwill flights carrying dependents or
other civilians. It was not known if the women had signed them.
	   But special rules apply to maintenance flights, limiting them to
only the people required to check a specific aircraft function.
Details of the recent maintenance were not disclosed.
	   ``They were flying the aircraft after it was in for some
maintenance,'' Bacon said at a daily briefing in Washington. ``It
was flying to see if those repairs had been successful.''
	   The bodies of the two women, Pam Guido and Rebecca Riddel, were
flown to the Miami suburb of Opa-locka and turned over to the
Miami-Dade County medical examiner's office. Their ages were not
released.
	   The crew chief, Sgt. William Westgate, 31, who was flown to
Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, was listed in stable condition
in intensive care, said spokeswoman Lorraine Nelson. No hometown
was issued for him.
	   The pilot, David Guido, 37, of North Haven, Connecticut, and
co-pilot Daniel Riddel, 30, of Andover, Connecticut, were airlifted
to Doctors Hospital in the Bahamian capital of Nassau. A hospital
spokeswoman said both men were in serious condition, although she
said Guido was released. The men are chief warrant officers.
	   The soldiers belong to the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Aviation Regiment,
in the aviation brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division at Fort
Stewart.
	   The UH-60 helicopter is capable of carrying a crew of three and
14 combat-equipped troops.
	   Crew seating is generally considered safer because of its
front-facing, energy-absorbing seats. The side-facing rear
passenger seats are not as sturdy.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Government workers in hundreds of
cars blocked the highway to Puerto Rico's main international
airport Tuesday, their blaring horns heralding the biggest labor
protest in the history of this U.S. territory.
	   Union leaders expected up to 500,000 of Puerto Rico's 3.8
million people to join the two-day strike protesting the
government's sale of the state telephone company to private
investors led by GTE Corp. About 6,400 telephone employees stopped
working June 18.
	   On Tuesday, the first day of the strike, tens of thousands of
government workers took to the streets, closing banks, shopping
malls and small businesses.
	   ``This has been a complete success. I think the economy is going
to be feeling this today,'' striker Eduardo Bermudes, a maintenance
worker for the Ports Authority, said as he sipped a can of beer and
watched the airport traffic jam.
	   Under police escort, tourists dragged their bags a mile and a
half (two and a half kilometers) to the airport terminal. Riot
police had set up barricades to protect the airport but were taken
by surprise when protesters blockaded the highway at dawn.
	   Demonstrations were generally peaceful. In the eastern town of
San Lorenzo, however, police detonated a bomb planted at a bank,
and gunmen shot out the windows of another bank in San Juan.
	   Also, telephone workers were accused of sabotaging phone lines,
leaving more than 250,000 people without long-distance service.
	   The government, in justifying the sale, says it cannot compete
in Puerto Rico's newly deregulated telephone market.
	   The dlrs 1.9 billion sale is the cornerstone of Gov. Pedro
Rossello's privatization program. His government has sold hotels
and a shipping company, transferred management of prisons and
hospitals to private companies, and plans to privatize other
utilities.
	   Union leaders who fear job losses and a loss of power accuse
Rossello, who wants to make Puerto Rico the 51st U.S. state, of
``selling the national patrimony.''
	   Rossello's supporters denounced the strike in newspaper
advertisements Tuesday, saying union leaders were trying to
frighten away foreign investment and create the perception that the
Caribbean island is too unstable to be admitted to the union.
	   The telephone strike has cost Puerto Rico as much as dlrs 100
million, and the general strike by more than 60 unions could
multiply that figure, said Santos Negron, a leading economist and
former member of the government planning board.
	   Near the airport, many tourists sweated in the tropical heat as
they dragged their luggage through the blockade of honking cars.
	   ``Well, I'm never coming here again!'' Spanish tourist Felipe de
Andrea said as protesters helped him heft his trunk and a case over
the freeway divider. Riot police carried the bags to a police van
that took him and others to the terminal.
	   LIAT Airlines canceled all flights, and at least two cruise
ships canceled port calls for Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   Thousands of flag-waving strikers later took their protest to a
telephone company office in the Hato Rey financial district and to
company headquarters in suburban Guaynabo.
	   In the last general strike in Puerto Rico, tens of thousands of
sugar cane cutters stopped working in 1934 to demand better
conditions.

Eagleson leaves jail a year early
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Alan Eagleson, once one of North American ice
hockey's most powerful figures, was released from jail on parole
Tuesday after serving six months of an 18-month sentence for fraud.
	   He walked briskly from the minimum-security Mimico Correctional
Centre west of Toronto for the last time early this morning. He
smiled and drove away without a word, waving as he left the parking
lot.
	   ``He is attempting as best as possible to return to private
life,'' said his lawyer, Edward Greenspan.
	   Eagleson, 65, will have to report to a probation officer for one
year and is forbidden to leave Ontario during that year.
	   Eagleson, a former player agent and founder of the NHL Players'
Association, pleaded guilty in Boston last Jan. 6 to three counts
of fraud and theft involving players' insurance premiums. He was
fined dlrs 1 million.
	   A day later, he pleaded guilty to three counts of fraud in
Toronto. Those charges involved skimming Canada Cup advertising and
tournament money from Labatts, Hockey Canada and the players'
union.
	   Eagleson has been on day parole for the last two months, working
as an office manager in a sheet metal factory. He will continue
working there for the next three to six months.
	   He has been disbarred as a lawyer and stripped of his Order of
Canada. He also resigned from the Hockey Hall of Fame.

<TEXT>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ Free agent goalie John Vanbiesbrouck signed
a two-year contract with the Philadelphia Flyers on Tuesday.
	   Terms of the contract were not immediately disclosed.
	   Vanbiesbrouck, 34, spent the last five seasons with the Florida
Panthers and was a member of Team USA at the 1998 Winter Olympics.
He was 18-29-11 with a 2.87 goals-against average in 60 regular
season games for the Panthers last season.
	   In 717 career National Hockey League games, the Detroit native
has a 306-285-90 record with a 3.12 goals-against average.
	   Florida took Vanbiesbrouck from the Vancouver Canucks in the
1993 NHL expansion draft. Vancouver had picked him up in a trade
from the New York Rangers, where he played parts of 11 seasons from
1981 to 1993.
	   Flyers goalie Ron Hextall, 33, is entering the final year of a
three-year contract, with a no-trade clause, to pay him dlrs 2.5
million for the 1998-99 season. Flyers General Manager Bob Clarke
has said that the last year of Hextall's contract may have to be
renegotiated if the team signed a big-name free-agent goaltender
and Hextall became a backup.

	   Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Emerson and Dunga all confidently converted
their chances in the penalty shootout and Frank de Boer and
Bergkamp did the same. But Taffarel then made his two dramatic
blocks and Brazil was headed for the final again.
	   Brazil will be trying to extend its record for World Cup titles
to five, two more than any other nation. It has only lost once when
it reached the final, that being at home in 1950 to Uruguay.
	   The Dutch were hoping to reach the final for the first time
since 1978.
	   The Brazilians seemed headed for the final early in the second
half.
	   Ronaldo ran onto a ball from Rivaldo that found its way between
Cocu and Frank de Boer, controlled it with the outside of his left
foot and then slipped it between the legs of Van der Sar 21 seconds
after the second-half kickoff.
	   The game was seen by some as the highlight of the semifinal
round, with the two sides generally being praised as the two most
offensive and with the most fluid attack.
	   Ronaldo's goal gave a spark of life to Brazil, which struggled
as the first half ended with the Dutch controlling the play.
	   But as in the first half, after a brief period of Brazilian
possession, the Dutch reasserted themselves.
	   Kluivert had several dangerous chances, headers that either went
high or wide and shot off a cross from Pierre Van Hooijdonk in the
80th that went well over the bar.
	   Dutch coach Guus Hiddink sent in midfielder Aron Winter for
defender Michael Reiziger in the 57th minute to press the attack,
enabling the Netherlands to swarm around the Brazilian net.
	   But the offensive push left the Dutch vulnerable to counters and
created space for Ronaldo and company.
	   Ronaldo beat the offside trap in the 73rd minute but his slow
roller from 10 meters past an advancing Van der Sar bounded
centimeters wide of the right post.
	   Four minutes later, Denilson sent in a cross to Rivaldo, who _
while sitting _ got off a shot from four meters that Van der Sar
did well to block.
	   The Dutch controlled the possession for most of the game,
including nearly all of the first half except for about 10 minutes.
	   Kluivert missed the best chance of the half when he drove a
header from six meters just over the bar in the 29th minute.
	   The Dutch came out quickly and controlled the first 10 minutes
before the Brazilians settled down and then did the same for the
second 10. But as the half drew to a close, the Dutch again had
reasserted control.
	   Both sides had to shuffle their lineups due to suspensions and
injuries. The Dutch were missing Arthur Numan due to his two-yellow
card ejection against Argentina, and his expected replacement,
Winston Bogarde, was out after fracturing his fibula in training on
Sunday.
	   Cocu was forced into a marking back role while Boudewijn Zenden
took over for the hamstring-hampered Marc Overmars, who was
available but not used.
	   Brazil had to play without Cafu, who accumulated two yellows in
the single-elimination or knockout phase, forcing coach Mario
Zagallo to use Ze Carlos, who was making his national team debut.

Top seed advances in first round
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEWPORT, Rhode Island (AP) _ Top seed Jason Stoltenberg, down a
break in the decisive third set, rallied to defeat Stefano
Pescosolido on Tuesday in the first round of the Miller Lite Hall
of Fame Tennis Championships.
	   Stoltenberg was broken in the fourth game of the third set and
trailed 4-1, but broke Pescosolido twice over the next six games to
post the 1-6, 6-1, 7-5 victory.
	   ``I was a little bit sluggish at the start,'' the 28-year old
Australian said. ``My hips were stiff and I wasn't getting much on
my serve.''
	   After losing the first set, Stoltenberg was in danger of being
broken in the third game of the second set. He was down love-40,
but rallied and held serve.
	   ``I lose that game and it would have been tough to recover,''
said Stoltenberg, who then won 19 points in a row in the second
set. ``I was fortunate to get out of it and then I got a roll
going.''
	   Second seed Mark Woodforde had an easier time defeating Stephane
Simian, 6-3, 6-2.
	   Woodforde is coming off a tough five-set loss in the Wimbledon
doubles final. He and his partner, Todd Woodbridge, came up short
in their bid to win a record sixth straight Wimbledon doubles
crown. He said Woodbridge made the right decision in deciding to
withdraw from this tournament because of exhaustion.
	   Other top seeds to advance Tuesday were John Van Lottum (7), who
beat Michael Sell, 6-1, 6-2, and Jeff Tarango (3), who struggled
against Harvard sophomore James Blake before winning, 6-7 (7-4),
6-4, 6-0.
	   No. 5 seed Martin Damm became the first seeded player to lose,
falling to Sabastien Lareau, 6-1, 7-5.

Dutch, Brazilian fans live it up _ peacefully
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Updates with result &QL; 
 &UR; By MORT ROSENBLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Special Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Dutchy the Lion stormed the beach
Tuesday. A raven-haired Brazilian woman wearing only fragments of
green and yellow fabric danced in the Old Port. Tens of thousands
of other Dutch and Brazilians sang, shouted and chugalugged.
	   Not even the World Cup crowd can drink France dry, but hearty
bands of survivors are doing their best. Four nations remain in the
tournament. As the soccer narrows down to high-intensity,
high-stakes final stages, so does the partying.
	   France meets Croatia in Paris on Wednesday to determine which of
the two makes the finals Sunday __ and who can throw a better
street party. And on Tuesday in Marseille, it was Brazil and
Holland.
	   On a scorching day, both sides partied together at Prado Beach
by the giant screen where English hooligans and ethnic Tunisian
locals rumbled last month. Also, they gathered at the port, another
England-Tunisia riot scene, now swept clean of broken glass.
	   ``We are the champions,'' bellowed Stephan Dammers, a
25-year-old medical supplier from Den Bosch with a bright orange
face, along with the music blasting out of monster speakers on the
beach. This was before the game, but the Dutch had no doubts.
	   Their opponents, whose faces were painted in blue, green and
yellow, had four prior World Cups to boast about. They looked
indulgently at the happy Dutch and chanted, ``Five times, five
times.''
	   As it turned out, Brazil won but not by much. The teams fought
to a 1-1 standstill during normal play and two overtime periods,
and outcome was settled by a penalty kick shootout, which ended 4-2
for Brazil.
	   Dammers had painted his predicted score in orange on his bare
chest, 1-0, without bothering to specify the victor. He arrived
Tuesday after a 15-hour bus ride only to head back on the bus _
much less jubiliant _ an hour after the final whistle.
	   ``Of course, it's worth it,'' he said. ``Just look around.''
	   Nearby, the team's mascot, Dutchy, a guy in a furry lion suit,
had just been ferried in over the waves in an open boat. People in
silly orange hats and capes snakedanced on the sand. Others,
without capes, splashed in the water.
	   The eclectic mix of music, brought from Holland, was heavy on
the universal soccer fans' unofficial theme, ``You'll Never Walk
Alone.'' It included ``Deep in the Heart of Texas,'' ``YMCA,'' and,
inexplicably, ``The Star-Spangled Banner.''
	   Among the crowd of gyrating Dutchmen, Karina Ramos from Rio de
Janeiro danced in green and yellow short shorts, a matching halter
and blue lips. Her friend Nelson Almeida, had a Brazilian flag on
the rippling muscles of his bare Tarzan chest.
	   ``Sure we'll win, but we can have fun together,'' Ramos said,
adjusting her Dutch orange cape and partying on.
	   At the port, it was more of the same. The police who had battled
with English and Tunisian fans were relaxed this time, rerouting
traffic to give the crowds room to frolick in the street.
	   Atop a small bus stop shelter, five fans combined into a living
statue. Four flew Brazilian flags at jaunty angles. A fifth, in a
tall orange hat and a Dutch blue-white-red flag, stood in the
center.
	   At a sidewalk cafe, a man with orange hair had a friendly
argument with a woman in blue and yellow hair over the likely
score. Neither spoke the other's language, so they held up fingers.
	   Gerson Senko, who works for Exxon in Rio, looked dignified
despite his splash of soccer-fan colors. He was banking on a 5-0
victory. His wife, Andrea, figured 4-2 was more likely. Neither had
given a thought to missing out on the World Cup.
	   The crowds were heavily laced with Frenchmen along with
foreigners whose teams have been eliminated. But it was hard to
tell. In this tournament, the idea is to pick a team and blend in
with its colors.
	   At Prado Beach, restaurateur Carlos Contreras was rooting for
Brazil, but he is Colombian. His own team did not get past the
early rounds.
	   ``I guess it's South American solidarity,'' he said. ``But even
more, it's the fun. The whole idea is to have a good time in
France. That much, I'm doing.''

World Cup: Brazil reaches final on penalties after 1-1 draw

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Taffarel stopped both Phillip Cocu and
Ronald de Boer and Brazil defeated the Netherlands 4-2 on penalty
kicks Tuesday night to reach the final and a chance at a fifth
World Cup title.
	   The Brazilian keeper dived to his left to stop Cocu and then to
his right to deny de Boer on consecutive penalty tries to clinch
the victory after the two countries fought to a 1-1 draw in extra
time.
	   The victory sent the defending champion to its sixth final on
Sunday against the winner of Wednesday night's other semifinal
between host France and upstart Croatia.
	   The penalty kick shootout seemed an almost anti-climatic ending
to a match that saw repeated chances and a late goal by the Dutch
to send the game into extra time.
	   Patrick Kluivert forced the extra 30 minutes with a goal in the
87th minute, finally putting one of his repeated headers on target.
De Boer sent a cross from the right, and Kluivert drove the ball
down from six meters that beat Taffarel to his left.
	   Both sides had several chances in the extra period that could
have ended it.
	   The Brazilians had the opportunities early, with Frank de Boer
clearing a Ronaldo scissors kick off the line with a header and
Dutch keeper Edwin van der Sar in the 94th and diving to block
Ronaldo's 20-meter blast less than a minute later.
	   The Netherlands had its chance when Kluivert sent a slow roller
just wide of the right post in the 103rd.
	   Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Emerson and Dunga all confidently converted
their chances in the penalty shootout and Frank de Boer and Dennis
Bergkamp did the same. But Taffarel then made his two dramatic

U.S. tourist killed in Belize protecting family
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KEN GUGGENHEIM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A Maryland science teacher vacationing in the
Central American country of Belize was shot to death while trying
to protect his wife and son from robbers in their cabin, a witness
said Tuesday.
	   Raymond Kirk, 47, of Chesapeake City, was killed Sunday at the
Singing Sands Inn on the Caribbean coast, about 80 miles (130
kilometers) south of Belize City. His wife and 12-year-old son were
uninjured. Police were searching for the killers.
	   In a telephone interview, Bruce Larkin, the owner of the inn,
said Kirk was shot by one of three men who held up his restaurant
and apparently were about to rob Kirk's cabin nearby.
	   The three men arrived by boat Sunday evening and walked into the
restaurant, where there were about a dozen customers, Larkin said.
Two of the men were armed with revolvers, and the third had a rifle
believed to be an AK-47, he said.
	   ``Everyone did exactly as they were told, fortunately,'' Larkin
said.
	   The robbers took about dlrs 200 in cash, jewelry from the
customers, liquor, cigarettes and a cordless telephone.
	   As they returned to their boat, they saw a light on in Kirk's
cabin, the closest to the dock. Kirk apparently saw them coming,
hid his wife and son in the bathroom and waited with a 10-inch
(25-centimeter) hunting knife.
	   ``When they opened the door, (Kirk) was standing in the doorway,
and they just immediately shot him,'' Larkin said. ``He was trying
to protect himself and his family.''
	   Kirk's body was scheduled to be flown back Wednesday to the
United States, the U.S. Embassy in Belize said.
	   Larkin, an Australian, said he has lived in Belize for five
years and has never heard about any violent crimes in the area.
	   According to a U.S. State Department advisory, crimes against
tourists in Belize resorts are rare.
	   Kirk had taught in Cecil County since 1981 and was a science
teacher at North East Middle School since 1989. His wife also is a
science teacher in the county at Bohemia Manor Middle School.
	   ``He was a respected member of the teaching staff,'' said Karen
Emery, a spokeswoman for the school system. ``It's definitely been
a tragedy for the schools and the family.''

Upper House of Lords defy government for third time
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ For the third straight time, Britain's unelected
House of Lords on Tuesday rejected a government bill seeking to
charge English students higher fees at Scottish universities.
	   The vote increased tension between the Labor Party government
and the Conservative-dominated upper house where Prime Minister
Tony Blair is pledged to strip hereditary peers of voting powers.
	   The government has signaled it will try again to get the bill
through Parliament. The measure would make students from England,
Wales and Northern Ireland who attend Scottish universities pay
four years of fees, while Scottish students only pay for three
years.
	   The 319-108 defeat in the Lords marked the first time in 30
years that the Lords have rejected government legislation three
times in a row.
	   The Lords' powers are limited to delaying legislation for up to
a year. Blair's government has said that the dispute over the
Scottish fees could delay its entire plan to end the current
practice of free university tuition and charge students 1,000
pounds (dlrs 1,650) a year.
	   The university fees bill, however, is opposed by an alliance of
Conservative and Liberal Democratic peers, many of them with
lifetime titles. They are buoyed by support from universities and
student organizations.
	   Opposition Conservative Party peers, whose leader, Lord
Cranborne, is the scion of an ancient aristocratic family,
immediately noted the defeat was mainly the work of life peers.
	   A statement by the Tory group said the government would have
lost the vote 153-92 even if hereditary peers had not voted.
	   ``If Labor will not listen to the advice of hereditary peers,
will they listen to life peers? Or don't they want a revising
chamber at all?'' the statement said.
	   Most life peers are retired politicians from the House of
Commons, appointed by party leaders.
	   Degree courses in Scotland are usually take four years, and
three years in the rest of the United Kingdom. The government says
that non-Scottish students who choose to go to Scottish
universities should pay for the extra year. Scots will only pay for
three years.
	   Critics say the move is unfair.

	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's most prominent political
prisoner, Moshood Abiola, died of a heart attack Tuesday after
falling ill during a meeting with a visiting U.S. delegation, the
government said. He was 60.
	   Abiola was the apparent winner of 1993 presidential elections
canceled by then-dictator Gen. Sani Abacha. He was jailed the
following year and accused of treason by Abacha, who died last
month of a heart attack. Abacha's five-year dictatorship made
Nigeria an international pariah.
	   Abiola's death Tuesday came on the same day Nigeria completed a
30-day official period of mourning for Abacha.
	   The country's new military leader, Abdulsalam Abubakar, had
reportedly been close to releasing Abiola. The apparent heart
attack struck during a meeting with a U.S. State Department
delegation led by Thomas Pickering, a former U.S. ambassador to
Nigeria, who was lobbying for Abiola's release.
	   ``Chief Abiola started talking with Undersecretary Pickering
when he started feeling uncomfortable,'' said Jim Callahan, a
spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria. ``He was clearly in
distress.''
	   Abiola had been drinking tea and chatting with Pickering before
he fell ill, Callahan said in a telephone interview.
	   ``We all helped to put him in a car, there was no ambulance
immediately available,'' Pickering said of Abiola's sudden illness
	   Speaking on CNN, Pickering said Abiola became ill in the early
stages of their meeting and asked for a doctor.
	   In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton said the delegation
accompanied Abiola to the hospital, ``and witnessed physicians at
the State House clinic work to try to save Chief Abiola.
	   A Nigerian government statement issued in the capital, Abuja,
said Abiola's death was sudden, but gave few details.
	   ``The federal government regrets to announce the sudden death of
Chief M.K.O. (Moshood) Abiola,'' the statement said. ``Chief Abiola
was taken ill during a meeting which was being held by Nigerian and
United States officials with him.''
	   The president's office said a full autopsy would be performed,
although the government said the cause of death was cardiac arrest.
	   The stunning news was the latest in a turbulent four weeks in
Nigeria, first with the death of Abacha and now with that of his
primary political foe.
	   An unlikely hero for democracy, Abiola became a rallying point
for Nigeria's disparate opposition groups during his years of
imprisonment.
	   Grief and sorrow swept across the country as news of his death
spread among his supporters.
	   ``It's shocking,'' said Roman Catholic Archbishop of Lagos
Anthony Okogie. ``His death is the end of a chapter.''
	   In the commercial capital of Lagos, news of Abiola's death was
met with quiet mourning, not fury. There were no signs of protests
in a city increasingly prone to unrest.
	   Abiola, once an ally of Nigeria's all-powerful military, fell
out of favor with Abacha in 1993 after winning the presidential
elections.
	   Abacha annulled the results, seized power and dissolved most
working government bodies.
	   When Abiola reasserted his claim to the presidency the following
year, Abacha had him imprisoned on treason charges.
	   Jailed and in failing health ever since, Abiola was said to be
close to release this month following the visit to Nigeria of U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   The U.S. delegation was in Nigeria to meet with the new military
leadership and lobby for the release of political prisoners,
including Abiola.
	   Abiola's family had repeatedly warned that his health had been
failing after years in detention under harsh conditions. His
fortune and personal life also suffered deeply during his
imprisonment. Two of his many wives died _ one in an
assassination-style slaying _ and his enormous business empire
largely collapsed.
	   Annan said he had met with Abiola and that the opposition leader
had decided to relinquish his claim to the presidency and cooperate
with Nigeria's junta in making a peaceful transition to democracy.
Many of his supporters, however, still wanted to see him take
office.
	   Nigeria became an international pariah under the rule of Abacha,
who took power following a coup in 1993.
	   Political jailings were rampant; between 250 and 280 people are
believed still held across Nigeria. All are kept in regular prisons
except for Abiola, who was detained in the relative comfort of a
government guest house in Abuja.
	   During Abacha's years in power, corruption left Nigeria's
economy and infrastructure in shambles. Despite the country's vast
oil reserves, motorists line up and wait for hours at the few gas
stations that haven't run dry.

	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ On the outside, they all wore
orange. On the inside, though, they all felt black.
	   Despondent Dutch soccer fans, some weeping openly, huddled on
street corners and consoled each other after Brazil narrowly
defeated the Netherlands in a World Cup semifinal Tuesday.
	   Shuffling quietly out of bars in the city center of Amsterdam,
fans clad in the national color _ orange _ shook their heads in
disbelief as their national team's World Cup journey abruptly ended
after weeks of hype and hoopla.
	   Brazil won 4-2 on a penalty shootout after a 1-1 tie in
regulation play, advancing to Sunday's final to face the winner of
Wednesday's match between France and Croatia.
	   Brazilians danced wildly in Amsterdam bars, but the Dutch were
understandably depressed.
	   ``This was a match we should have won,'' snapped the 29-year-old
Patrick Vermeulen of Amsterdam. ``There were a lot of
opportunities.''
	   Silence replaced earlier roars in places such as Amsterdam's
central Leidesplein square, where soccer balls dangled like
Christmas tree ornaments from trees whose trunks were wrapped in
bright orange plastic.
	   Around the Dutch capital, and indeed, the nation, fans found
quiet spots to weep.
	   The gloom came in stark contrast to celebrations that swept
through the country only days ago, when the Netherlands defeated
Argentina to reach the semifinal.
	   Fans who danced and rejoiced in the streets then now strived
mightily to accept the defeat.
	   ``They played equally well. The Brazilians just had a little bit
more luck,'' said Paul de Vries, who watched the game in a bar with
a group of friends.
	   He vowed to give up soccer and follow tennis from now on.
	   Standing nearby, his friend, Mark de Wit, was too upset to talk.
	   Another friend, Remco Zannis of Amsterdam, managed to mumble a
few words.
	   ``It will take me years to recover,'' he said, adding he hasn't
given up on the team quite yet.
	   After all, the European Championship is just two years away in
2000, an event to be co-hosted by the Netherlands and Belgium.
	   There is, of course, another World Cup in four years, he added
with a grin.
	   Because the Dutch also have their share of soccer hooligans,
police in major cities were girding for possible post-game riots,
Dutch television reported. However, there were no immediate reports
of violence.
	   In the Netherlands, up to 11 million people, or 76 percent of
the population, watched Tuesday evening's game on television.

Some facts about Nigeria
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Facts and figures about Nigeria:
	   ___
	   PEOPLE: 115 million, Africa's most populous nation, made up
mainly of Hausa, Fulani, Yoruba, Ibo ethnic groups. English is
official language. About 50 percent are Muslim, 40 percent
Christian, and 10 percent practice indigenous religious customs.
	   ___
	   LAND: 923,000 square miles (1.485 million square kms), twice the
size of Sweden. Bordered by Atlantic Ocean, Benin, Cameroon, Chad
and Niger.
	   ___
	   ECONOMY: One of world's leading oil producers with an output of
2 million barrels a day. Oil sector provides 95 percent of foreign
exchange earnings and 80 percent of budget revenues. Tight control
of oil by military governments has discouraged investors and led to
high inflation and unemployment. Largely subsistence agricultural
sector has failed to keep up with rapid population growth. Per
capita income was about dlrs 1,300 in 1996.
	   ___
	   GOVERNMENT: Military government since 1983. In 1993, businessman
Moshood Abiola becomes the apparent winner of presidential
elections, which are then annulled by Gen. Sani Abacha. Abiola,
considered by many to be the country's legitimate president, is
jailed in 1994 and charged with treason. Abacha in 1995 announced
the military would hand power to a democratically elected civilian
government in October 1998; In April, Abacha became only nominee
for president after the five sanctioned parties were pressed to
endorse him. Abacha died in June 8 of heart failure. Abiola,
expected to be released within days, dies of an apparent heart
attack after falling ill during meetings with visiting U.S.
officials.
	   ___
	   HISTORY: Independence from Britain in 1960. Nigeria is shattered
by a devastating civil war lead by ethnic Ibo military officials
who try to establish the Republic of Biafra, an independent state.
Generals ousted Nigeria's last civilian government in 1983. Abacha
seized power in 1993 after canceling presidential elections and
suspending the constitution. Moshood Abiola, the businessman who
had won the aborted vote, declared himself president in defiance of
Abacha in 1994 and was jailed. He died Tuesday after falling ill
during a meeting with U.S. officials.

Shock at death of top Nigerian political prisoner; opponents blame

military regime &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with comments by Abiola's daughter; shortens

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Shock, sorrow and renewed pleas for Nigeria to
return to civilian rule greeted the death Tuesday of the nation's
most prominent political prisoner, Moshood Abiola.
	   Opposition groups blamed his death on ill-treatment during four
years in jail and harassment by the military regime.
	   In New York, U.N. Secretary-general Kofi Annan, who met with
Abiola just a week ago and who expected his imminent release from
jail, called on Nigeria's new military leader, Gen. Abdulsalam
Abubakar, to fulfill promises ``to release all remaining political
prisoners unconditionally and to define a credible process for the
democratic transition to civilian rule within a reasonable
period.''
	   Abiola, presumed winner of 1993 elections, suffered an apparent
heart attack while meeting a visiting U.S. State Department
delegation.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Nigeria had lost its
``symbol of democracy.''
	   ``It is therefore particularly tragic that he should die now at
this time of change and hope for Nigeria,'' added Cook.
	   Abiola's daughter, Wuru, fighting back tears in a British
Broadcasting Corp. TV interview, said that ``of all the conditions
he had, heart was not one of them.''
	   ``All our efforts have come to nothing because without his life
there is nothing else we can fight for,'' she said.
	   But then Miss Abiola added, ``This is the wake up call for all
our leaders that we don't have time. We must secure the future for
all Nigerians.''
	   While Annan said Abiola had seemed in good health when they met,
the London spokesman for a coalition of opposition groups said
Abiola's health had been deteriorating for a long time.
	   Bolaji Akinyemi, a Nigerian former foreign minister who is now
spokesman for the National Democratic Coalition of Nigeria, urged a
delay in burial for a team of World Health Organization doctors to
perform an autopsy.
	   ``... The last four years of his life, the blows that he
suffered, the assassination of his wife, the physical abuse in jail
_ probably part of which has contributed to this cardiac arrest _
have to me made him a martyr in African politics,'' said Akinyemi
in an interview with Britain's Channel 4 TV network.
	   Akinyemi, foreign minister from 1985-87, said Abiola was the
only politician since Nigeria's independence from Britain in 1960
who bridged the divide between north and south, Christians and
Muslims, rich and poor.
	   '' People from all over the country voted for this man. Nigeria
has lost its best hope in many, many years,'' said Akinyemi.
	   At the U.N. headquarters in New York, Nigeria's ambassador,
Ibrahim A. Gambari, urged Nigerians to wait for the results of an
autopsy that he said would be performed in the presence of Abiola's
personal doctor and family.

USA Basketball picks best of the rest to replace NBA players
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ With National Basketball Association players
ordered to stay home, former Michigan star Jimmy King and Duke
standout Trajan Langdon are among those who will be competing for a
spot on the U.S. world championship team.
	   USA Basketball released a list today of the 30 players invited
to training camp, which is being held this week at the Moody Bible
Institute. The roster will be pared to a 12-man team next week,
with the 1998 FIBA World Championships July 21-Aug. 9 in Athens,
Greece.
	   ``We feel confident that out of this group we can and will field
a very competitive team, a team that will go out and try to win the
world championship,'' coach Rudy Tomjanovich said.
	   Those invited include four current college players _ Langdon;
Richard Hamilton of Connecticut; Mateen Cleaves of Michigan State
and Evan Eschmeyer of Northwestern _ and two others, Earl Boykins
of Eastern Michigan and Purdue's Brad Miller, who just completed
their eligibility.
	   There also are 12 CBA players, nine who played overseas and
three who played both overseas and in the CBA.
	   USA Basketball had selected 12 NBA players to represent the
United States in the world championships. But with an NBA lockout
looming July 1, the NBA players threatened to boycott the world
championships.
	   USA Basketball moved first, announcing June 16 it was dropping
the NBA stars and replacing them with current college players, CBA
players and Americans playing overseas.
	   But some players turned down the invitations, saying they did
not want to interfere with the lockout. Dominique Wilkins said he
considered it, but decided against trying out because he did not
want to betray the NBA players.
	   The United States, with a team of NBA players, won the World
Championships in Toronto in 1994.

How much longer will Kuchar remain amateur?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Not long ago, the question was whether the U.S. Amateur champion
with the megawatt smile and a game suited for golf's toughest tests
would give up his college eligibility to turn pro.
	   Matt Kuchar won't command the same kind of endorsement money
that Tiger Woods got two years ago, but it's enough to get him
thinking whether he should take advantage of his rocketing
popularity.
	   Kuchar and his cheeky grin stole everyone's heart at the
Masters, where he tied for 21st. Two months later at the U.S. Open,
he dusted playing partners Ernie Els and Justin Leonard in the
first two rounds and was two off the lead going into the weekend.
He wound up tied for 14th.
	   He left Sunday for Scotland, where he was invited to play the
Loch Lomond World Invitational. Then he's off to Royal Birkdale for
the British Open, having earned a spot by winning the U.S. Amateur.
	   In between, he has been besieged by agents who want to know if
he'll be on the market by the time school starts, and by dozens of
interview requests.
	   ``You know, for the first time, I'm seeing all of this get to
Matt. I'm seeing him get a little bit on edge,'' Peter Kuchar, his
father and fist-pumping caddie, told The Orlando Sentinel.
	   ``It's crazy,'' his father said. ``He needs some space. At least
Tiger gets paid for all he does ... but our day will come.''
	   The question is, how soon?
	   Had he turned pro after the Masters, Kuchar already would have
won more than dlrs 102,000, halfway home to winning enough money to
secure his playing card.
	   If he turns pro after the British Open _ or after the U.S.
Amateur, as Woods did in 1996 _ he still could get sponsor's
exemptions into five PGA Tour events and try to win enough money to
avoid qualifying school.
	   Even he fails to qualify for the PGA Tour, Kuchar at least has
secured a place in the Masters and U.S. Open, based on his
performance at those majors this year. Business insiders estimate
his endorsement value anywhere from dlrs 2 million to dlrs 10
million.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; AUSSIE ALERT: &LR;  Greg Norman is out until November because of a
bad shoulder. Ian Baker-Finch is in voluntary semi-retirement
because of bad play. Steve Elkington is still trying to recover
from bad sinuses.
	   But if the weather is hot and dry next week at Royal Birkdale,
three-time British Open champion Nick Faldo says to beware of the
Australians.
	   ``When it gets hot and the course is hard-running, Birkdale
plays just like the sandbelt courses in Melbourne,'' Faldo said
last week at the Irish Open. ``If we get those conditions, which we
normally do, then that could play right into the hand of the
Australians.''
	   It certainly did the last time the Open was played at Birkdale.
	   Baker-Finch shot 64-66 on the weekend to win by two strokes over
fellow Aussie Mike Harwood. Others from Down Under: Craig Parry was
sixth, Norman was eighth and Rodger Davis tied for 12th.
	   And don't forget, Peter Thomson won two of his five British Open
titles at Birkdale.
	   Might this be Stuart Appleby's year?
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; TALE OF TWO ROOKIES: &LR;  Two LPGA rookies were paired in the first
two rounds of the first tournament of the year, the HealthSouth
Inaugural.
	   Kelli Kuehne, the two-time U.S. Amateur champion, had signed a
deal with Nike even before she qualified for the tour and was
billed as the women's version of Tiger Woods.
	   She played with Se Ri Pak, a 20-year-old South Korean virtually
unknown outside Asia.
	   Since then, Pak has become the first player since Juli Inkster
in 1984 to win two majors in her rookie season. She won the LPGA
Championship in May, and on Monday became the youngest player to
win the U.S. Women's Open.
	   Kuehne, who failed to qualify for the Open, has not finished
higher than 25th in 14 tournaments. She is ranked 148th on the
money list with dlrs 12,778.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; BACK AT BIRKDALE: &LR;  Ian Baker-Finch will be back at Royal
Birkdale, site of his 1991 British Open title. No need for the
gallery to take cover _ Baker-Finch will be in the broadcast booth
for ABC Sports.
	   ``I think it's great and I'm looking forward to it,'' he said.
``No other Australian has done it, and I think I've got a good
voice for it.''
	   The affable Australian's career took a nose dive in the years
after winning his first and only major. His only victory since
Birkdale was the 1993 Australian PGA, and he has not made a cut in
America since 1994.
	   At Royal Troon last year, Baker-Finch withdrew after a 92 in the
first round. At St. Andrews in 1995, he hooked his drive so badly
on the first tee that it cleared the adjacent 18th fairway and went
out of bounds.
	   Baker-Finch said earlier this year he was stepping away from the
game, but it as if he'll stay close through television. According
to The Age newspaper in Melbourne, Baker-Finch has signed on to
work 16 tournaments in 1999 and 2000.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; BEAR TRACKS: &LR;  Jack Nicklaus, still bothered by his left hip,
may not decide until the week of the British Open whether to extend
his streak of 146 consecutive majors.
	   Nicklaus will be in Manchester, England, on Monday to open a
course he built with his son, Gary.
	   ``If it holds up, I'll play the British,'' he said. ``But if
it's hurting again by then, I doubt I'll be able to give it a go.''
	   Nicklaus, 58, tied for sixth at the Masters and tied for 43rd at
the U.S. Open. He has made the cut in 10 of the last 12 majors.

Dutch fans console one other following World Cup semifinal defeat

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ On the outside, they all wore
orange. On the inside, though, they all felt black.
	   Despondent Dutch soccer fans, some weeping openly, huddled on
street corners and consoled each other after Brazil narrowly
defeated the Netherlands in a World Cup semifinal Tuesday.
	   Shuffling quietly out of bars in the city center of Amsterdam,
fans clad in the national color _ orange _ shook their heads in
disbelief as their national team's World Cup journey abruptly ended
after weeks of hype and hoopla.
	   Brazil won 4-2 on a penalty shootout after a 1-1 tie in
regulation play, advancing to Sunday's final to face the winner of
Wednesday's match between France and Croatia.
	   Brazilians danced wildly in Amsterdam bars, but the Dutch were
understandably depressed.
	   ``This was a match we should have won,'' snapped the 29-year-old
Patrick Vermeulen of Amsterdam. ``There were a lot of
opportunities.''
	   Silence replaced earlier roars in places such as Amsterdam's
central Leidesplein square, where soccer balls dangled like
Christmas tree ornaments from trees whose trunks were wrapped in
bright orange plastic.
	   Around the Dutch capital, and indeed, the nation, fans found
quiet spots to weep.
	   The gloom came in stark contrast to celebrations that swept
through the country only days ago, when the Netherlands defeated
Argentina to reach the semifinal.
	   In the runup to Tuesday's pivotal match, fountains across
Holland spewed orange-colored water. In the southern city of
Tilburg, one farmer even painted his cows the national color and
named them Bergkamp and Overmars for Dutch players Dennis Bergkamp
and Marc Overmars.
	   But that was then, and this is now. Fans who danced and rejoiced
in the streets were striving mightily to accept the Dutch defeat.
	   ``They played equally well. The Brazilians just had a little bit
more luck,'' said Paul de Vries, who watched the game in a bar with
a group of friends.
	   He vowed to give up soccer and follow tennis from now on.
	   Standing nearby, his friend, Mark de Wit, was too upset to talk.
	   Another friend, Remco Zannis of Amsterdam, managed to mumble a
few words.
	   ``It will take me years to recover,'' he said, adding he hasn't
given up on the team quite yet.
	   After all, the European Championship is just two years away in
2000, an event to be co-hosted by the Netherlands and Belgium.
	   There is, of course, another World Cup in four years, he added
with a grin.
	   Because the Dutch also have their share of soccer hooligans,
police in major cities were girding for possible post-game riots,
Dutch television reported. However, there were no immediate reports
of violence.
	   In the Netherlands, up to 11 million people, or 76 percent of
the population, watched Tuesday evening's game on television.

Top Nigerian political prisoner dead

	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's most prominent political
prisoner, Moshood Abiola, died of a heart attack Tuesday after
falling ill during a meeting with a visiting U.S. delegation, the
government said. He was 60.
	   Abiola was the apparent winner of 1993 presidential elections
canceled by then-dictator Gen. Sani Abacha. He was jailed the
following year and accused of treason by Abacha, who died last
month of a heart attack. Abacha's five-year dictatorship made
Nigeria an international pariah.
	   Abiola's death Tuesday came on the same day Nigeria completed a
30-day official period of mourning for Abacha.
	   The country's new military leader, Abdulsalam Abubakar, had
reportedly been close to releasing Abiola. The apparent heart
attack struck during a meeting with a U.S. State Department
delegation led by Thomas Pickering, a former U.S. ambassador to
Nigeria, who was lobbying for Abiola's release.
	   ``Chief Abiola started talking with Undersecretary Pickering
when he started feeling uncomfortable,'' said Jim Callahan, a
spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria. ``He was clearly in
distress.''
	   Abiola had been drinking tea and chatting with Pickering before
he fell ill, Callahan said in a telephone interview.
	   ``We all helped to put him in a car, there was no ambulance
immediately available,'' Pickering said of Abiola's sudden illness
	   Speaking on CNN, Pickering said Abiola became ill in the early
stages of their meeting and asked for a doctor.
	   In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton said the delegation
accompanied Abiola to the hospital, ``and witnessed physicians at
the State House clinic work to try to save Chief Abiola.
	   A Nigerian government statement issued in the capital, Abuja,
said Abiola's death was sudden, but gave few details.
	   ``The federal government regrets to announce the sudden death of
Chief M.K.O. (Moshood) Abiola,'' the statement said. ``Chief Abiola
was taken ill during a meeting which was being held by Nigerian and
United States officials with him.''
	   The government ordered an autopsy, but said the cause of death
was cardiac arrest.
	   But Abiola's daughter, Hafsat, said she believed medical neglect
or poison had killed her father.
	   ``His doctors weren't allowed to see him for a year and a
half,'' she told CNN. She said she suspected poison because ``it
was too convenient. All of a sudden at the eve of his release, he
dies.''
	   Another daughter, Wuru, told said in a British Broadcasting
Corp. TV interview, said that ``of all the conditions he had, heart
was not one of them.''
	   The stunning news was the latest in a turbulent four weeks in
Nigeria, first with the death of Abacha and now with that of his
primary political foe.
	   An unlikely hero for democracy, Abiola became a rallying point
for Nigeria's disparate opposition groups during his years of
imprisonment.
	   Grief and sorrow swept across the country as news of his death
spread among his supporters.
	   ``It's shocking,'' said Roman Catholic Archbishop of Lagos
Anthony Okogie. ``His death is the end of a chapter.''
	   In the commercial capital of Lagos, news of Abiola's death was
met with quiet mourning, not fury. There were no signs of protests
in a city increasingly prone to unrest.
	   Just north of Lagos, however, in the university town of Ibadan,
students took to the streets in a show of outrage over Abiola's
death while still in military custody.
	   More than a thousand students blocked key intersections and set
enormous bonfires along the roads, a police spokesman said. There
were no immediate reports of arrests or injuries linked to the
protests.

Devils re-sign Holik to 3-year contract
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EAST RUTHERFORD, New York (AP) _ Days after losing Doug Gilmour
to free agency, the New Jersey Devils re-signed restricted free
agent center Bobby Holik to a multi-year contract.
	   General manager Lou Lamoriello did not release terms of the deal
but reports said it was a three-years deal worth dlrs 7.6 million.
	   Holik, 27, had a career season with the Devils, scoring 29 goals
and collecting 65 points, both team highs. He was the only Devil to
appear in all 82 regular season games, and he has appeared in 180
straight dating to March 13, 1996.
	   The agreement, which was reached Monday, came just four days
after Gilmour signed a three-year, dlrs 18 million deal with the
Chicago Blackhawks.
	   In an interview with the Star-Ledger of Newark from his home in
Wyoming, Holik said he was surprised the deal was completed so
quickly.
	   ``At the same time, we were pleasantly surprised,'' Holik said.
``I can focus on hockey now and not business.''
	   Holik missed training camp two years ago because of contract
negotiations.
	   Holik, a native of Jihlava in the Czech Republic, was acquired
by the Devils in 1992 from Hartford. He has 150 goals and 187
assists in 560 career games.

Australia: No instant solutions to East Timor problem
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Instant solutions to the East Timor
issue will not resolve the ongoing division and difficulties there,
Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer said.
	   Speaking ahead of his visit to Indonesia on Wednesday, where
East Timor and Irian Jaya will be high on the agenda for talks with
new Indonesian President B.J. Habibie, Downer called for ``patient
dialogue.''
	   But he did not support an immediate move toward a referendum on
the disputed territory.
	   ``People who argue that you should immediately have a referendum
and resolve the whole issue there and then are not offering a
solution,'' he told Australian Broadcasting Corp. TV on Tuesday
night.
	   ``I think as a result of that you would have a deeply divided
community still, it's much more important to work towards dialogue
and building confidence throughout the community before you start
thinking about referendums.''
	   Downer reiterated the government would like to see a reduction
in Indonesia's military presence in East Timor and greater autonomy
for the people there.
	   ``We are pleased to see things moving in that direction,'' he
said, but added more dialogue was needed.
	   His comments came after church and human rights groups said
Indonesian troops may have killed up to five people and injured 141
when they fired on a crowd which raised a separatist flag in remote
Irian Jaya province.
	   Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jose Ramos Horta said
demilitarization was a critical step.
	   He said there were now ``positive indications of the good
intentions of the Jakarta government but they must move more
expeditiously,'' he told ABC.
	   ``Let's move step by step forward, first with demilitarization,
then to genuine local autonomy, and then in 5, 10 years from now,
let's have independence,'' he said.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor, former Portuguese colony, in 1975
and annexed it a year later. The half island territory has endured
hit-and-run warfare and human rights abuses since then.

London subway workers to strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Workers on London's underground train network
decided to strike for the second time this summer after a dispute
over job security ended without agreement Tuesday.
	   Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union voted for a
24-hour walkout starting Sunday night after pressing for government
assurances that conditions of service, jobs and pensions will not
be affected by plans for private firms to become involved in
running parts of the network.
	   More than 2 million people, including commuters and tourists,
travel every day on the London Underground, familiarly known as the
``tube.''
	   The union, which is seeking guarantees of no compulsory layoffs,
said the talks were a ``charade.''
	   London Transport Chief Executive Denis Tunnicliffe said strikes
would not change the government's direction for the subway system.
	   The union, which represents one-third of the tube staff, staged
a 48-hour walkout last month that disrupted tube services and
closed some stations.

 &UR; PUERTO RICO: General strike gets off to heady start &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Government workers in hundreds of
cars blocked the highway to Puerto Rico's main international
airport Tuesday, their blaring horns heralding the biggest labor
protest in the history of this U.S. territory.
	   Union leaders expected up to 500,000 of Puerto Rico's 3.8
million people to join the that only the minimum flight crew is
allowed on maintenance flights intended to check repairs.
	   ``They've got to find out what in the world the wives were doing
on an Army aircraft,'' said the Army spokesman who asked that his
name not be used. ``The fact that they're civilians is the issue.''
	   Asked about the crash, Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said
specific authorization is required for civilian passengers, but he
referred questions about the Bahamian flight to the Army.
 &UR; JAMAICA: Ambassador's son released from prison
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ The son of Jamaica's ambassador to the
United States was released from prison after serving eight months
for trying to smuggle marijuana in cans of pineapple juice,
officials said Tuesday.
	   Brian Bernal, 24, the oldest son of ambassador Richard Bernal,
was released from a minimum security prison on Monday. He was
released 4 months early because of good behavior.
	   Bernal, an architecture student at Howard University in
Washington, was caught at Jamaica's Norman Manley International
Airport in Kingston with 95 pounds (43. kilograms) of marijuana.
The drug was hidden in 24 cans marked ``pineapple juice.''
	   Bernal said a friend, Kingston businessman Christopher Moore,
had given him the cans. Moore claimed he bought them at a wholesale
store and did not know they contained the drug.
	   He was convicted with Bernal on charges of ``taking steps to
export'' the marijuana.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: European official wants U.S. to ease Cuba sanctions
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Congress should pass legislation to ease U.S.
restrictions on multinational companies doing business with Cuba or
risk losing a pledge for cooperation from European countries,
European Commission Vice Chairman Sir Leon Brittan said Tuesday.
	   He said that if Congress eased restrictions, the 15-nation
European Union would carry out its obligations under an agreement
with the U.S. for European companies to avoid investing in
companies holding assets that include U.S. property seized by the
Cuban government. That agreement was reached last May with the
Clinton administration.
	   Brittan said a good-faith effort by the administration to get
the legislation changed, if it ended unsuccessfully, would not be
acceptable. He also said he could not agree to reopening
negotiations to modify the agreement.
	   ``The U.S. has to amend the legislation,'' Brittan said. ``If it
does not, then it can't expect us to carry out our side of the
agreement.''
 &UR; JAMAICA: Castro to visit
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Cuban President Fidel Castro is
expected to visit Jamaica this year, a government spokesman
announced Tuesday.
	   Castro already is scheduled to visit the Dominican Republic and
Grenada in the next couple of months.
	   A spokesman for Jamaica's foreign ministry said no date had been
set for Castro's visit to Kingston. But he said he expected it to
be around the same time the Cuban leader would visit Barbados.
	   There have been unconfirmed reports that Castro plans a trip to
Barbados _ possibly to commemorate the 1976 crash of a Cubana
Airlines jetliner off Barbados that killed 73 people.
	   Jamaican Prime Minister P.J. Patterson visited Cuba last year,
when several other island leaders made first-time visits in a
Caribbean initiative to improve relations and boost trade with
Havana despite opposition from the United States.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks edged lower near the close Tuesday as
investors turned cautious before a torrent of company profit
reports that will determine if the market's sudden rebound was
justified. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average
finished 6.73 points lower at 9,085.04. An afternoon gain of 59
points briefly put the Dow at 9,150 and just a chip shot away from
May 13's closing record of 9,211.84. Broader indexes also
surrendered modest gains. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   LONDON (AP) _ As Europe has grown closer politically and
economically, the idea of one big stock exchange could be coming
closer to reality. The two biggest markets, longtime rivals London
and Frankfurt, embarked Tuesday on a bold joint venture that they
predict will lure others into a big blue-chip exchange for all of
Europe, listing around 300 major companies. London Stock Exchange
chairman John Kemp-Welch proclaimed it ``the first step along the
road to a single European market,'' but analysts cautioned that
creating a market second only to the New York Stock Exchange won't
necessarily be an easy step. It remains to be seen how other
European markets will respond to the move, which some may view as a
threat to their own profitable turfs. (BRITAIN-GERMANY STOCK
EXCHANGE)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian government bonds took a nosedive Tuesday
and the stock markets continued to sink while officials pressed
ahead with appeals to the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank for new loans. Interest rates on short-term government bonds
shot up to 120 percent, from 90 percent on Monday, as the Central
Bank failed to intervene to bring down the soaring yields. The
stock market dropped 4.5 percent, despite assurances that the
government was getting closer to a bailout agreement with the IMF.
The ruble closed slightly lower against the U.S. dollar. Anatoly
Chubais, Russia's representative to international lenders, met with
officials of the IMF and the World Bank for two hours. He said
afterward the parties would meet again Thursday to settle
outstanding issues. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ After posting a series of
record lows against the U.S. dollar, the South African currency
made a dramatic recovery Tuesday, regaining 64 South African cents
on Monday's all-time low. Foreign speculators evidently decided to
take profits from their onslaught on the rand by selling dollars
back to the market, dealers said. By the close of business in
Johannesburg, the rand strengthened to 6.12 against the U.S.
currency, from 6.44 at Monday's close. The naming of a political
heavyweight as the first black central bank governor jerked the
rand to 6.76 to the dollar _ its weakest ever _ earlier on Monday.
(SOUTH AFRICA-CURRENCY)
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Germany's job market showed ``unusually strong''
improvement in June, due partly to an upswing in the German
economy, Labor Office President Bernhard Jagoda said Tuesday.
Confirming figures released last week by Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
who is seeking to bolster a sagging re-election bid, Jagoda said
unemployment dropped to 10.5 percent last month from 10.9 percent
in May. Despite the improvement, jobless protesters rallied in
cities and towns around Germany in what has become a regular
monthly event timed to the release of unemployment figures. ``Talk
about improvement is just an election campaign strategy. That's why
we're continuing to protest,'' said protest coordinator Uwe
Kantelhardt. (GERMANY-UNEMPLOYMENT)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union regulators Tuesday
approved the acquisition by British Aerospace PLC of a 35 percent
stake in Swedish aircraft company Saab AB. The European Commission
said the operation will strengthen both companies' positions in the
European defense industry but not cause serious competition
concerns since they face strong competition from European and
American companies. ``The operation is a further step towards the
transnational restructuring and consolidation of the European
defense industry,'' the Commission said in a statement. Overlap
between Saab and British Aerospace on their respective home markets
is ``insignificant,'' the Commission added. (EU-BRITISH
AEROSPACE-SAAB)
	   DETROIT (AP) _ With losses mounting at General Motors, the chief
of GM's North American car operations said Tuesday there is ``no
end in sight'' to the strikes that have brought the world's biggest
automaker to a near standstill. Negotiations continued at the
strikebound plants in Flint. Separate talks between top officials
of GM and the United Auto Workers were held at a hotel nearby. The
first of the two strikes is the longest at GM since a 67-day
walkout in 1970. (US-GM STRIKES)

	   Here is a summary of late news from The Associated Press.
Stories carried ``i'' or ``f'' category codes. Some of the items
below have moved on this circuit in expanded form:
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's most prominent political
prisoner, Moshood Abiola, died of a heart attack Tuesday after
falling ill during a meeting with a visiting U.S. delegation that
was pressing for his release, the government said. He was 60.
Abiola was the apparent winner of 1993 presidential elections
canceled by then-dictator Gen. Sani Abacha. He was jailed the
following year and accused of treason by Abacha, who died last
month of a heart attack. Abacha's five-year dictatorship made
Nigeria an international pariah. Abiola's death Tuesday came on the
same day Nigeria completed a 30-day official period of mourning for
Abacha. The country's new military leader, Abdulsalam Abubakar, had
reportedly been close to releasing Abiola. The government ordered
an autopsy, but said the cause of death was cardiac arrest.
(NIGERIA-ABIOLA)
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The General Assembly agreed Tuesday to
give the Palestinians U.N. rights and powers just short of those
granted member states, despite opposition from the United States,
which said the move would harm the peace process. Israel dismissed
its significance as ``a minor correction'' in the status of the
Palestinian observer mission and said the Palestinian attempt to
change its standing violated peace accords. The Palestinians called
the 124-4 vote a huge step toward a declaration of statehood. The
Arab-sponsored resolution gives the Palestinian observer mission a
unique, nonvoting seat in the 185-member assembly. Palestinian
representatives will have expanded powers but cannot vote or put
forward candidates for U.N. committees, such as the Security
Council. (UN-PALESTINIAN)
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Britain said Tuesday it will
deploy more troops to Northern Ireland to combat widespread
Protestant intimidation aimed at overthrowing the ban on an Orange
Order march through a Catholic neighborhood. Prime Minister Tony
Blair agreed to meet leaders of the 80,000-strong Protestant
brotherhood after two nights of rioting over whether Orangemen can
parade through the main Catholic enclave of Portadown, the group's
spiritual heartland southwest of Belfast. In Portadown, several
hundred Orangemen remained encamped in tents outside the rural
Drumcree Anglican church, where extensive barbed-wire barricades
prevented their annual parade. They have vowed to hold their ground
until authorities let them complete their march. (NORTHERN IRELAND)
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Media mogul and former Premier Silvio
Berlusconi on Tuesday received his second conviction for
corruption, this time with a prison sentence of two years and nine
months. Berlusconi was convicted of bribing tax inspectors to
obtain favorable audits of his Fininvest media and retail holding
company. It was little likely, however, that Berlusconi, who heads
the center-right opposition, was going to jail following the
verdict of the Milan court after a 2 1-2 year-long trial. Under a
new law, sentences under three years are eligible for suspension.
In any case, Italian prison sentences rarely begin being served
until after the second appeal, a process which can take several
years. Berlusconi's lawyers said they would appeal.
(ITALY-BERLUSCONI-BRIBERY)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Pakistan's foreign secretary defended his
country's nuclear tests Tuesday in a speech intended to explain
Pakistan's reasons and the effects of resulting sanctions to a U.S.
audience. Sanctions aren't in America's interest because they will
lead to more instability in central Asia, Shamshad Ahmad told about
100 journalists, academics, business associates and foreign policy
experts at the Asia Society. Calling his country America's ``most
sanctioned strategic ally,'' Ahmad defended Pakistan's decision to
test the devices as a right to protect itself against aggression
from neighboring India, which exploded nuclear devices two weeks
before Pakistan did. The tit-for-tat tests this spring raised fears
of a nuclear arms race in South Asia and resulted in U.S. sanctions
against both countries. Other countries, such as Japan and
Australia, cut off aid. (US-PAKISTAN-NUCLEAR)

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on Yoko Ono, Michael Jackson, Poland's gays,
Antonio Banderas, Melanie Griffith and Pavolv the comic strip dog.
Some items may also have moved as separates.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Yoko Ono says she isn't betraying John Lennon by
selling his art works, because he always intended them to be sold.
	   That's the word from her spokesman, Elliot Mintz, who said in
Tuesday's Daily News that Ms. Ono is being unfairly criticized by
Julian Lennon, John's son from his first marriage. The younger
Lennon said selling off the former Beatle's art ``is not what he is
about.''
	   The former Beatle didn't create these works, ``and sign and date
them so they wouldn't be seen or sold,'' Mintz said of Lennon's
drawings and lithographs, copies of which are selling for dlrs 400
to dlrs 12,000. ``During his lifetime, he personally released a
series of lithographs and made them commercially available.''
	   Limited-edition copies of Lennon's work are part of a show
called ``Music for the Eyes: The Artwork of John Lennon,'' which is
touring the country.
	   Besides, said curator Lynne Clifford, Ms. Ono isn't profiting
from the sales. Ms. Clifford said the proceeds go toward running
the exhibit.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   DETROIT (AP) _ Michael Jackson's plans to build a casino
entertainment complex in Motown are in the hands of Detroit voters.
	   Jackson and millionaire Don Barden unveiled plans Tuesday for a
dlrs 1 billion Majestic Kingdom, including a theme park, hotel,
casino, botanical gardens and nightclubs that would employ about
6,000 people. But they won't build it without the casino, Barden
said, and that's up in the air.
	   Barden's previous bid for one of the Detroit's three casino
licenses was rejected by Mayor Dennis Archer, but his supporters
launched a petition drive to ask voters if he should get one. The
question will be on the ballot next month.
	   ``We're looking at wonderful projects all over the world _
family theme-oriented projects,'' Jackson said. ``And my mission is
to just push the envelope of technology beyond its limitation in
creating the most wonderful themes as humanly possible for the
heart, for the childlike heart that lives inside every man and
woman.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Polish gays will hold their first public
festival _ but dare not hold a parade in this predominately Roman
Catholic country.
	   The festival, to be held Friday and Saturday in Warsaw's Old
Town square, will inaugurate the gay community's new ``Rainbow''
counseling center. The Polish gay magazine ``New Man,'' a sponsor
of the festival, will hold a dance.
	   But there will be no flamboyant parade of floats and marchers,
such as the Annual Gay and Lesbian Pride March in New York City,
which passes through the gay mecca of Christopher Street, or the
``Christopher Street Day'' parades held recently in Germany.
	   ``The approach of Polish society to homosexuals is so
unfavorable that organizing a parade would risk unpleasant
incidents,'' Krzysztof Garwatowski, of Poland's gay magazine ``New
Man,'' told the news agency PAP.
	   Discrimination against homosexuals in Poland is widespread and
accepted.
	   The Solidarity-led government has strong links to the Catholic
Church, which traditionally opposes homosexuality. About 95 percent
of the population of 39 million is Roman Catholic.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Tabloid gossip isn't as funny as it used to
be for Antonio Banderas.
	   ``For a while, we were tacking up the stories on the wall,''
said the Spanish actor, who is married to American actress Melanie
Griffith. ``Melanie rolls on the floor laughing about this stuff. I
don't. She doesn't pay the least bit of attention to that. Me, it
hurts.''
	   Banderas, who makes his directorial debut in the movie ``Crazy
in Alabama,'' said the couple are concentrating these days on their
daughter, Stella.
	   ``In the 18 months since she came into the world, I've learned
more from her than she's learned from me,'' Banderas said in the
August issue of Movieline. ``They ask so directly for everything
that it doesn't matter what you think you were going to do or what
you want to do, your baby tells you, `I want you, right now.'''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Pavlov the comic strip dog is 189 in doggie years
and retiring after a good _ if manic _ life.
	   The popular strip, which started in the Toronto Sun in 1971 and
appeared in 100 newspapers around the world at the height of its
popularity, is ending.
	   Ted Martin's daily cartoons began as a social commentary, with a
couple commenting on life, and the dog was just a prop with nothing
to do with the punchline.
	   But readers could see him misbehaving in the background, doing
headstands or crossing his eyes.
	   ``On the days when the dog wouldn't appear, the switchboard lit
up,'' Martin says.
	   Eventually, the standing, talking, wrist-watch and spotted
handkerchief-wearing character came to dominate the strip, which
was syndicated in 1978.
	   When ideas for the dog's absurd antics came more slowly, Martin
decided it was time to put Pavlov to bed.
	   He hopes to unveil a new comic strip next spring with the help
of his 14-year-old son. Leo helped draw the last Pavlov panel,
which will be published on July 25.

World Cup: Deschamps, captain ready to outdo Platini
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ Michel Platini vs. Didier
Deschamps. France's all-time star vs. Who?
	   Platini led France to two World Cup semifinals in 1982 and 1986.
Deschamps can captain his team to the World Cup final on Wednesday
if Les Bleus survive the clash against Croatia at the Stade de
France.
	   The winner will play Brazil in Sunday's final.
	   If Platini has achieved just about everything in soccer, a World
Cup final has remained beyond his grasp. For Deschamps, it may be
only 90 minutes away.
	   Going into his 75th international Wednesday, Deschamps has
already outlasted regal playmaker Platini by three appearances and
at 29, he still has some good years ahead of him. Yet he is little
known outside of Europe.
	   Mainly because Deschamps shares the defensive midfielder's lot.
Run yourself ragged for the whole match, rob the opponent of the
ball, give it to a star playmaker who feeds a star striker. Who
remembers the man who won the ball?
	   He is happily resigned to that. What could be better than
winning balls for Zinedine Zidane for France during the World Cup
and for Juventus during the Italian season.
	   ``The midfield battle is always important,'' said Deschamps. On
Wednesday, it won't be any different. He'll have to fight and win
the ball from the likes of Zvonimir Boban and Aljosa Asanovic.
	   Yet a huge threat hangs over Wednesday's performance. He
collected one yellow card against Italy in the quarterfinal for a
bodycheck on Juventus teammate Alessandro Del Piero. Now he is one
referee's card away from missing the ultimate match, the World Cup
final.
	   ``I know, I'll have to watch out,'' he said. ``I'll have to
manage my match. I've done it in the past and I worked out.''
	   A lot has worked out for the stocky Basque of 1.74 meters
(5-feet-8) and 71 kilos (157 pounds).
	   He captained Olympique Marseille to the European Champions Cup
triumph in 1993, a watershed title in French soccer history.
	   He moved to Juventus Turin, where he won the European Champions
Cup, the European Supercup and the Intercontinental Cup, all in
1996.
	   ``I've had the luck to win quite a few things in my career,''
Deschamps said. ``But the only thing that counts now is the World
Cup.''

Fewer Japanese to go abroad this summer for first time since 1980
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Reflecting Japan's weak economy, the number of
Japanese traveling overseas this summer is likely to fall for the
first time in 18 years, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   About 3.17 million people are expected to go abroad for their
summer vacation this year, 2.4 percent less than last year,
according to a survey by the Japan Travel Bureau published in the
Asahi daily.
	   Besides Japan's slumping economy, a weaker Japanese currency and
the Asian economic crisis will also keep people at home, the Asahi
quoted the survey as saying.
	   The drop would be the first drop since 1980 when Japan's economy
was reeling from the second oil shock, the Asahi said, quoting
Justice Ministry figures. The only other year-on-year drop was
recorded in 1974, following the first oil shock, the paper said.
	   But the survey by the travel agency showed that the number of
Japanese planning to take vacations inside the country this summer
was set to increase 1.4 percent from last year to 84.7 million
people.

World Cup: Cocu finally in the wrong place
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Phillip Cocu finally found a position
where he didn't look comfortable: The penalty spot.
	   His saved spotkick Tuesday signaled the end of the World Cup for
the Dutch as they lost an enthralling semifinal to reigning
champion Brazil in a penalty shoot-out.
	   Cocu's penalty, the Netherlands' third, was saved by Taffarel.
It meant that Ronald de Boer had to score with his. But De Boer's
was saved too to consign the Dutch to a 4-2 penalty defeat after
the match had ended 1-1.
	   ``If you take a penalty, you know you have a chance of missing
it,'' Cocu said. ``I'm cut up about it.''
	   Ordered by referee Ali Mohamed Bujsaim to respot the ball
because it was placed too far forward, Cocu looked nervous as he
walked back to start his run up.
	   He struck the ball well but Taffarel reached it easily diving to
his right.
	   ``You just have to score them,'' Ronald De Boer said.
Unfortunately he couldn't match his brother, Frank, who fired home
the first Dutch penalty and gave his team a chance.
	   It was a sad end of an otherwise outstanding World Cup for Cocu
who moves from PSV Eindhoven to Barcelona next season.
	   He started the tournament in midfield, shifted to the forward
line in the absence of suspended striker Patrick Kluivert and then
returned to midfield for the quarterfinal victory over Argentina.
He looked solid in midfield and scored twice as a makeshift
striker.
	   On Tuesday, the versatile left footer was in defense, plugging a
gap left by the suspension of Arthur Numan and an injury to Winston
Bogarde, who broke his leg in training on Sunday.
	   For the first time, Cocu looked vulnerable and his two mistakes
cost the Dutch the match.
	   First Ronaldo muscled past him in the Dutch penalty area to
squeeze a low shot under 'keeper Edwin van der Sar for Brazil's
goal in the first minute of the second half. Cocu recovered and
played well for the rest of the match and in extra time. But then
came the penalty shootout and the Dutch were left to go home
instead of to the final.

World Cup: Shootout decides Brazil-Dutch semifinal

 &UR; By ANDREAS EVAGORA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Marseille's Stade Velodrome saw its
fair share of tight finishes in its previous incarnation as a
cycling circuit. Nothing quite like this, however.
	   Brazil's 4-2 victory on penalties over the Netherlands Tuesday
ranks as one of the most important _ and tense _ spot kick
shootouts in soccer history.
	   The prize couldn't have been much greater: a place in the World
Cup final.
	   After 120 minutes of an end-to-end, often raucous 1-1 draw, the
shootout was more like a prayer meeting than a soccer match, with
each team huddled together, hand-in-hand, nervously watching.
	   On the bench, some members of both coaching staffs couldn't even
stand to open their eyes as player after player stepped up to take
his penalty.
	   Before the shootout, Brazilian coach Mario Zagallo said he spoke
to each of his would-be shooters, trying to instill confidence.
	   ``Confidence is a key factor in a penalty shootout,'' Zagallo
said. ``Some players think 'If I miss, they'll crucify me.' So I
tried to give them confidence.''
	   Brazil converted its four chances without the slightest inkling
of anxiety: Ronaldo, Denilson, Emerson and Dunga each gave Dutch
goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar no chance.
	   By contrast the Dutch, for the first time in the match, looked
unnerved.
	   Frank de Boer and Dennis Bergkamp converted the Netherlands'
first and second penalties.
	   But with the pressure mounting, the third penalty taker, Phillip
Cocu, nervously placed the ball centimeters off the penalty spot as
he prepared to kick.
	   After being asked by the referee to put the ball on the spot,
Cocu sent a shot low to the right, only to see Taffarel pull off a
fine two-handed block.
	   ``If you take a penalty, you know you have a chance of missing
it,'' Cocu said. ``I'm cut up about it.''
	   Taffarel made another save from the fourth kick, from Ronald de
Boer, and the tension made way for wild celebration amongst the
Brazilians _ and a stunned silence among the Netherlands team.
	   ``You just have to score them,'' de Boer said.
	   Roberto Carlos was first to console his Real Madrid teammate
Clarence Seedorf, but for 15 minutes many Dutch players were unable
to move.
	   ``We did our best,'' de Boer said. ``We could have won. Now the
dream is over.''
	   For Taffarel, the unlikely hero in a match billed as a stage for
the high-scoring forwards on both sides, it was a sort of
redemption.
	   ``I expected it,'' Zagallo said. ``He's a great goalkeeper even
though he has always been criticized in Brazil.''
	   Taffarel was just happy to have been part of the victory,
instead of a defeat.
	   ``We won a battle. A very tough battle, but just a battle,'' the
goalkeeper said. ``We still have to win the war.
	   ``We are happy to give the Brazilian people this joy. Brazil
doesn't have too many reasons to feel happy.''

Stranded Romanian crew to head home after nearly one-year wait
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COATZACOALCOS, Mexico (AP) _ A crew of Romanian sailors who were
in the Gulf of Mexico for nearly a year will head home now that a
Mexican company has acquired their broken down cargo ship, a
maritime officer said Tuesday.
	   The Oituz dropped anchor seven miles (11 kilometers) off the
coast of Tabasco state after its propeller broke on Aug. 10, 1997.
It had been carrying 14,000 tons of sugar to Croatia.
	   The Romanian state shipping firm Navrom had offered to fly the
crew home, but 22 men refused because they would forfeit their
salaries. Instead, they chose to remain on the decaying and
cockroach-infested ship with little food or water.
	   Antonio Rodriguez Fritz, secretary-general of the Order of Naval
Captains and Pilots, said Tuesday that a Mexican shipping company
has taken ownership of the vessel and agreed to pay the crew a
total of about dlrs 300,000 in back pay.
	   The Romanians, who expect to return home in about two weeks,
were happy with the agreement, he said.
	   During their wait, the crew had relied on money sent by Navrom
to buy food in Frontera, a port city 450 miles (725 kilometers)
east of Mexico City. But they could afford to buy little: Rations
meant for eight days were stretched over 15.
	   Once, when no food money arrived, Frontera residents took pity
on the crew and chipped in to buy vegetables and fruit.

Scientists: New dinosaur species discovered
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: RECAPS pvs and ADDS comment from Dinamation International
Society

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A cat-like, flesh-eating dinosaur discovered in
fossils on an island off the south coast of England is from a
previously unknown species, a paleontologist said Wednesday.
	   The remains, found early last year by an amateur fossil
collector in a crumbling coastal cliff, show that the 12-foot-long
(3.6-meter) creature was equipped with murderous claws, razor sharp
teeth and unusually long hind legs on which it ran at high speed.
	   ``Nothing quite like it has been seen before,'' Steve Hutt,
curator of the Isle of Wight Museum of Geology at Sandown, who is
heading the excavation, said Tuesday. ``We know we've got a new
specimen.''
	   Hutt said a scientific paper on the discovery will not be
published for a while, but that he had checked with two American
experts and museums around the world and could not find anything
similar.
	   Jim Kirkland, senior paleontologist for the Colorado-based
Dinamation International Society, a dinosaur research group, said
Wednesday that the latest find was important because there were
enough fossils to determine what the animal was like and because
dinosaurs of the early Cretaceous age, which occurred between 140
million and 65 million years ago, do not come along often.
	   ``This is the first small meat-eating dinosaur that I know of
found in Britain,'' Kirkland said.
	   Dinosaur fossils are found all over the world, but Britain is
the birthplace of dinosaur paleontology and the Isle of Wight is a
particularly important hunting ground, he said.
	   About 450 species of dinosaur have been identified so far, and a
new one is established about every six weeks, Kirkland added.
	   The latest find bears some resemblance to a Velociraptor, the
clawed dinosaur that was one of the creatures depicted in the movie
``Jurassic Park,'' Hutt said.
	   ``This was an animal which was incredibly graceful as well as
being very tough. It had very long, powerful hands with big claws,
and very long back legs,'' he said. ``We were absolutely stunned by
the length of the fibula and tibia (leg bones). It was something
completely new.''
	   The dinosaur had a very long tail, up to twice the length of its
body, Hutt said.
	   He said the quality of the latest find was ``quite
breathtaking,'' noting that most small, meat-eating dinosaurs are
badly preserved.
	   It will take a year or two before all the fossil remains are
excavated. So far, a portion of the skull and jaw, both hands and
arms, elements of both feet, a piece of the tail, vertebrae and
ribs have been discovered, Hutt said.
	   He said the dinosaur had been swept up in a flood 120 million
years ago, ``cartwheeled around'' and dumped at the site where it
was found.
	   The precise location is being kept secret to protect it from an
invasion of curious visitors. It is in a region where pieces of the
cliff have been falling into the sea, exposing hidden fossils.
	   Two years ago, another previously unknown dinosaur, Neovenator
salerii, a smaller version of Tyrannosaurus rex, was found there.

UN gives Palestinians new rights _ over US objections

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The vote to give Palestinians nearly the
same U.N. rights as those given independent states was largely
symbolic, but its significance wasn't lost on the United States _
or the Palestinians.
	   Washington said the move could undermine its efforts at
peacemaking. The Palestinians called the 124-4 vote in the General
Assembly a huge step toward declaration of statehood.
	   Israel dismissed Tuesday's action as ``a minor correction'' in
the status of the Palestinian observer mission and called the
Palestinian attempt to change its standing a violation of the peace
accords.
	   The Arab-sponsored resolution gives the Palestinian observer
mission a unique, nonvoting seat in the 185-member assembly. The
Palestinians aren't full members, but have more rights now than
other observer states, such as Switzerland or the Vatican.
	   The new powers mean Palestinian representatives can raise issues
concerning the peace process in the General Assembly, cosponsor
draft resolutions on Middle East peace and reply on the record to
speeches made at the world body. They cannot vote or put forward
candidates for U.N. committees, such as the Security Council,
however.
	   But more important was the symbolism of the vote, which affirmed
international support for the Palestinians in the protracted Middle
East peace process.
	   ``It is an admission of their legitimate rights and it
constitutes support for the peace process,'' Nabil Abourdeineh, a
senior aide to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, told The
Associated Press. ``It is a huge step toward the imminent
declaration of statehood.''
	   No other entity has such a U.N. status, and the move was a blow
to the United States, Israel's closest ally at the United Nations.
	   Washington had argued against the new designation, saying any
U.N. action on Israel or the Palestinians could jeopardize its
efforts to restart peace talks, which have been stalled since March
1997.
	   ``This is the wrong resolution at the wrong time,'' U.S.
Ambassador Bill Richardson told the assembly before the vote. ``It
could undermine our efforts to get the peace process back on track
and hurt everyone's interests, including those it most intended to
help.''
	   In Washington, White House press secretary Mike McCurry called
the resolution ``misbegotten'' and said it was ``detrimental to the
effort to help these parties bridge their differences.''
	   ``It's got nothing to do with resolving the real issues that
will bring peace in that region. It's got everything to do with
short-term political symbolism,'' McCurry said.
	   The United States, Israel, Micronesia and the Marshall Islands
voted against the resolution. Ten members abstained.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the vote ``a
minor correction'' in the Palestinians' status but said he was
``concerned with the actual attempt by the Palestinians to
predetermine their international status because this is a clear
violation of the Olso accords.''
	   Israel's U.N. ambassador, Dore Gold, also rejected the attempt
as a violation of peace accords, although he said it represented
``no effective change'' in the PLO's status at the United Nations.
	   Austria's ambassador, Ernst Suchairpa, speaking on behalf of the
European Union, said he voted for the resolution because of
consistent Palestinian complaints that there was no charter that
codified the rights of observers.
	   ``The rights and privileges have been indeed granted over the
decades on a case-by-case basis,'' he said. ``This resolution is
therefore not regarded by the European Union as creating a
precedent.''
	   Because of the unique vote, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
must report back to the assembly on how the Palestinians' new
rights would be implemented.
	   The Palestine Liberation Organization was granted observer
status in the General Assembly in 1974, enabling it to maintain an
office in New York, but without the same privileges as missions of
U.N. member states.
	   The PLO's status was upgraded in 1988 when the General Assembly
decided to designate the PLO as ``Palestine.''

Kosovo fighting intensifies as diplomats convene

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Intensified fighting between ethnic
Albanian militants and Serb forces in Kosovo has put increased
pressure on officials from six countries who are meeting Wednesday
to try to negotiate a solution for the trouble province.
	   Serb forces shelled four villages Tuesday near the southern town
of Djakovica, ethnic Albanian sources said. Serb sources,
meanwhile, said insurgents withdrew from a village near Pec where
two policemen were killed the previous day.
	   A visible buildup of Serb security and government forces on the
roughly 30-kilometer (20-mile) stretch of road linking Djakovica to
Pec raised fears Tuesday of fresh clashes between the security
forces and ethnic Albanian guerrillas who control large areas on
either side of the road.
	   The heightened tensions came a day before the Contact Group for
the Balkans _ including Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Russia and
the United States _ are to begin discussions in Bonn, Germany on
how to curb fighting between the secessionist Kosovo Liberation
Army and Serb security forces.
	   On Tuesday, diplomats were discussing the need for an
internationally monitored cease-fire between the two sides that
would prevent the KLA from using the opportunity of a troop
withdrawal to rush in and seize more territory.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo since Serb forces
launched a crackdown on ethnic Albanian extremists in late
February.
	   Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in the province, which
is part of Serbia. Serbia and Montenegro form the Yugoslav
federation.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the ethnic Albanian
leadership, said Tuesday's shelling occurred near Djakovica, about
15 kilometers (10 miles) northeast of the Albanian border.
	   According to the center, smoke could be seen billowing from the
villages but there was no report of casualties.
	   Earlier Tuesday, the Serb Media Center said the KLA had pulled
back from the village of Lodja, a few kilometers (miles) from Pec,
where both sides reported fighting the previous day.
	   Serb sources said two policemen were killed and nine others
wounded in Monday's fighting around Lodja. Ethnic Albanian sources
said late Tuesday that three KLA members died in Lodja over the
past two days, identifying them as officer Lumni Surdulli, 29, and
privates Rrustem Bruci, 40 and Enver Alaj, 33.
	   The Kosovo center reported that 13 members of the KLA were
wounded in the clashes in Lodja, which they claim is controlled by
the militants, but surrounded and sealed off by Serb forces. Twenty
houses in Lodja were damaged in the fighting, the center said.
	   Before the Albanians withdrew, Serb forces evacuated 11
civilians and two policemen overnight from the village, the Serb
center said. Albanian sources said scattered fighting persisted in
the Lodja area Tuesday.
	   In the nearby city of Pec, hundreds of grieving friends,
relatives and police officers buried the body of Mirko Radanavic,
36, Tuesday after he was shot in fighting in Lodja.

World Cup: Through highs and lows, Taffarel saves Brazil again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ In Brazil, a goalie with a knack for
defending penalties gets the nickname ``saint.'' And it was St.
Taffarel who saved them against the Dutch.
	   The balding 32-year-old picked off shot after shot against the
relentless Dutch strikers. But he saved the best for last, blocking
two attempts in a penalty-kick shootout to send Brazil to the World
Cup final against France or Croatia.
	   Yet Taffarel is far from a consensus. Many Brazilians protested
when coach Mario Zagallo insisted on making him the No. 1 goalie.
In practice, he has the worst record in defending penalties.
	   ``The coaches say, `hey, you don't get even one.' But I just say
I'll stop them when it counts,'' he said.
	   It rarely counted more than on Tuesday, after Brazil and the
Netherlands had played to a 1-1 tie over 120 minutes and headed to
the penalty box to decide.
	   Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Emerson tallied for Brazil, Frank de Boer
and Dennis Bergkamp for the Dutch. Not a miss, and Philip Cocu was
up.
	   He stepped up confidently to the line and fired midway up on the
right side. Taffarel dove to knock it away.
	   Dunga converted, and Ronald de Boer had the match at his feet.
He picked the lower left corner, and so did Taffarel. Save, game
over, and the Brazilian bench emptied to mob their hero.
	   There had been one moment more important than this, the '94 Cup
final. And Taffarel was there, stopping the fourth shot by Daniele
Massaro and giving Brazil a record fourth Cup title _ and the
beginning of ``sainthood.''
	   In the explosion of relief and joy after the second save, there
was a special moment with Zagallo, his mentor, defender and
sponsor.
	   ``It made me proud to see him crying and happy,'' Taffarel said.
``He gave me this moment so many times calling me to the team ...
He went against many people who didn't want me on the team, and I'm
grateful.''
	   Brazilians tend to love or hate Taffarel, ever since he emerged
a decade ago as a phenomenon among goalies. In 1990, at the age of
24, he was a starter on Brazil's World Cup team.
	   Brazil lost that Cup, and Taffarel began a long slide that
reached a low point when he was benched on Italy's Parma. Still,
Carlos Alberto Parreira _ with Zagallo's backing _ called him up
for the '94 Cup.
	   It was downhill again after that, and Taffarel seemed to be
playing out his career on Atletico Mineiro. But Zagallo wanted his
experience on the renewed national team he was assembling.
	   Experience counts, but Taffarel lives only for the next victory.
	   Today is an unforgettable day, but we have to forget it,'' he
said. ``We havent't won anything yet. It's just one battle. I'm
happy to live this moment.''

Archives gives a glimpse of Kennedy assassination film in cold

<TEXT>
	   COLLEGE PARK, Maryland (AP) _ Abraham Zapruder's famous
26-second movie of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy
is stored in a vault as cold as the deed it depicts.
	   It sits in a gray, metal file cabinet in a U.S. National
Archives room kept at 25 degrees Fahrenheit (-4 Celsius) and 30
percent relative humidity. It's there with other historical films
such as footage of man on the moon and home movies shot by Adolf
Hitler's mistress, Eva Braun.
	   Film preservationist Alan Lewis pulled an orange, insulated suit
over his clothes Tuesday and opened a door that resembles one on a
meat locker to give reporters a rare behind-the-scenes look at how
the Zapruder film is stored.
	   ``We can't tell you that this was the original film because for
many years it was not in the hands of the archives. The chain of
custody, therefore, is not complete,'' Lewis explained, handling
the film with lint-free gloves to keep skin oils and cells from
damaging it.
	   ``But all the evidence suggests to us and to the experts who
have looked at the film, that it is (the) camera-original.''
	   The original was taken by Zapruder, a Dallas dress manufacturer,
on Nov. 22, 1963, the day Kennedy was shot in Dallas. It remains
sharp. Its vivid tones still show the greens of grassy areas and
the pinks of Jacqueline Kennedy's suit and hat.
	   The film, which provides a timeline for the assassination, has
shrunk slightly over the years. It is no longer shown on a
projector because it could be scratched and the sprocket teeth on
projectors no longer match the holes on the film. Otherwise, it's
in good condition.
	   Keeping it cold and dry slows the fading of colors. It also
slows what is known as ``vinegar syndrome,'' in which the film
begins to revert back to acetic acid, which is vinegar, Lewis said.
	   The National Archives offered its peek into the storage vault as
the clock ticks toward the government's taking ownership of the
footage later this summer, and toward the release of a video of the
film that should be in stores later this month.
	   Zapruder started crying when he told investigators in July 1964
of seeing the gruesome scene through his Bell and Howell home movie
camera's telephoto lens.
	   The film was not shown during Tuesday's tour, but a copy _ one
of three made the day of the assassination _ was displayed on a
lighted table. The copy, stretching out about 4 feet (1.2 meters),
contains six frames missing from the original.
	   The missing frames _ two of early scenes of the motorcade and
four when the presidential limousine is behind a freeway sign _
were inadvertently destroyed by technicians at Life magazine, said
Charles Mayn, an audiovisual specialist at the archives. The
magazine bought the original from Zapruder and later sold it back
to the family, which still owns it.
	   ``The sequence that's missing is before the Stemmons Freeway
sign and it's when the president emerges from the sign that you
start to see the movement to his throat, indicating he's been hit
by the first shot,'' said Steve Tilley, custodian of the Kennedy
material at the archives.
	   Later this month, anyone will be able to buy a copy of
Zapruder's home movie _ dlrs 19.98 for VHS and dlrs 24.98 for
digital video disc _ at U.S. video stores.
	   The Kennedy family has decided not to comment on the video
release or a decision in April 1997 by the Assassination Records
Review Board to declare the Zapruder film the permanent possession
of the people of the United States.
	   The government, or possibly the courts, must now determine how
much the government should compensate the Zapruder family for the
film.
	   Initially, the family requested dlrs 18.5 million. The
government countered with dlrs 750,000, then raised its offer to
dlrs 3 million.
	   ``We've offered to arbitrate,'' said Robert Bennett, the
Zapruder family's lawyer. ``We're prepared to limit the cap to dlrs
30 million, which is far less than many of the appraisals.''
	   The Justice Department has not responded to the arbitration
proposal.

Dollar falls, Tokyo stock prices gain in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the yen early
Wednesday on speculation Japan will implement a permanent tax cut
to stimulate the economy. Tokyo share prices advanced moderately.
	   The dollar bought 138.80 yen in early morning, down 1.03 yen
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and above its late New York rate of
138.75 yen overnight.
	   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto is scheduled to hold a news
conference in Nagoya, central Japan, later Wednesday, where he is
expected to announce tax cuts, the mass-circulation Yomiuri
newspaper said.
	   Markets are hoping for tax cuts sizable enough to bolster
consumer demand in Japan and rejuvenate the country's stagnant
economy, which could also boost struggling Asian economies.
	   On Tuesday, Hiromu Nonaka, a senior ruling Liberal Democratic
Party official, said the prime minister was definitely going to cut
some taxes permanently.
	   Hashimoto is to visit Nagoya to campaign for Sunday's elections
to the upper house of Parliament.
	   Pressure is growing for Japan to revive its economy. European
Commission Vice President Sir Leon Brittan urged the country
Tuesday to implement permanent tax cuts to help deal with bad debts
held by its banks.
	   Brittan made his remarks in Washington after meeting with U.S.
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Rubin's deputy Lawrence
Summers, who have both called on Japan to tackle its bad debt
problems.
	   On the stock market, stocks continued to advance on hopes for
permanent tax cuts.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 126.58 points, or 0.77
percent, to 16,542.86 points in the first 30 minutes of trading. On
Tuesday, the Nikkei index closed up 65.83 points, or 0.40 percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 5.33 points, or 0.42 percent, to 1,270.14. The
TOPIX closed up 6.36 points, or 0.51 percent, the day before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.335 percent from Tuesday's finish of
1.305 percent, driving its price down to 110.92 yen from 111.15
yen.

World Cup: Brazil heads for final after another penalty shootout
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Brazil is looking good for its fifth
World Cup victory. Just ask its coach.
	   ``Physically Brazil was good and tactically Brazil was good,''
Mario Zagallo said after his team beat the Netherlands 4-2 in a
penalty shoot-out after their scintillating semifinal ended 1-1
after extra time.
	   Goalkeeper Taffarel, who blocked two penalties to give Brazil
victory, said they got a little divine help too.
	   ``God blessed us at the right moment,'' he said.
	   The Dutch, seeking its third World Cup final berth after losing
the title games in 1974 and 1978, gave the reigning World Champion
its toughest test of the World Cup so far but still came up just
short.
	   ``It hurts to come this close and lose,'' said Ronald de Boer,
one of two Dutch players to have his spot kick saved by the
inspirational Taffarel.
	   Brazil now faces the winner of Wednesday night's other semifinal
between France and Croatia as it closes in on its fifth world
title.
	   ``It's a happy moment but nothing more,'' Taffarel said. ``The
cup isn't over. I wish it were, but we'll play the final thinking
proudly of this one.''
	   The Dutch travel to Paris for Saturday's third-fourth place
playoff with the loser of the France-Croatia semifinal.
	   ``We will go there and show the world how well we can play,'' De
Boer said.
	   After an uneven tournament so far, Brazil finally began to look
like World Champion Tuesday in a thrilling match at the Stade
Velodrome, but not in the first half.
	   Ronaldo was closely guarded by Dutch captain Frank de Boer and
central defender Jaap Stam but finally managed to slip away to
score in the first minute of the second half.
	   ``With Ronaldo's speed and ability he eluded the defender and
scored,'' Rivaldo said.
	   The defender was Phillip Cocu, playing in the gap left by
suspended left back Arthur Numan and his injured replacement
Winston Bogarde.
	   Dutch coach Guus Hiddink did not seek to use the missing players
_ left winger Marc Overmars took no part in the game because of a
hamstring injury _ as an excuse.
	   ``I won't hide behind that excuse,'' Hiddink said. ``It is cheap
to say Bogarde couldn't play or Overmars couldn't play or Numan was
suspended.
	   ``We have a good squad and the players who replaced them all did
a good job. I'm happy and satisfied with the performance of the
team against a great team.''
	   As usual, the Dutch scored late. Patrick Kluivert made it 1-1
with three minutes left, rising to head in a Ronald de Boer cross
from the right as the flat-footed Brazilian defense left him space
and time to pick his spot.
	   Kluivert had already squandered a string of good scoring chances
before he finally found the net on a day when star Dutch striker
Dennis Bergkamp posed no threat.
	   The Dutch defense ruled the first half, holding Brazil to just
one innocuous long-range free kick by Roberto Carlos shortly before
the break.
	   But with the second half just 21 seconds old, Ronaldo turned the
game around for Brazil, racing on to a Rivaldo pass, brushing aside
Cocu and shooting under Edwin van der Sar's dive.
	   Denilson replaced Bebeto for Brazil in the 69th minute and gave
new life to the Brazilian offense with his samba-style dribbles.
But the strikers couldn't convert.
	   The Dutch could have sneaked a victory in regulation time as
they piled on pressure following Kluivert's goal but Taffarel saved
a Bergkamp shot and Kluivert's rebound effort as the 90 minutes
ended level.
	   Both sides came close to settling the match with a Golden Goal
in extra time, but neither could find the net.
	   Brazil, which won the 1994 World Cup on penalties against Italy,
handled the nerve-jangling pressure better than the Dutch and
progressed.
	   ``We did our best,'' Ronald de Boer said. ``We could have won.
Now the dream is over.''

Japan's trade surplus soars in first 20 days of June
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's trade surplus soared in the first 20 days
of June to 718.57 billion yen (dlrs 5.18 billion), up 60.4 percent
over the same period last year, the Finance Ministry said
Wednesday.
	   Exports rose 4.8 percent from last year on higher exports of
cars and film equipment, and imports dropped 6.4 percent on
decreased imports of crude oil, wood, electric parts and
semiconductors, the ministry said.
	   The figures were reported before adjustment for seasonal
factors.
	   In May, the last full month for which statistics are available,
the trade surplus rocketed to 1.219 trillion yen (dlrs 9.03
billion), up 66.6 percent from the same month last year.
	   Demand for foreign products has remained weak amid Japan's
economic slowdown, while the weak yen against the U.S. dollar has
made Japanese exports cheaper in the United States.

Rain forest pygmies in race with loggers, hunters in Gabon

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOUMBI, Gabon (AP) _ A lifetime of stalking elephants and other
jungle prey with bow and arrows has bent Angou's ancient body
nearly double. His mouth is toothless and he speaks in a frail,
halting voice.
	   Angou _ who looks like he's in his 80s but doesn't know his age
_ has vivid memories of his childhood, when Europeans first slashed
through the steamy rain forest and entered the realm of the Bongon
pygmy tribe.
	   ``The white men brought us clothing _ much better than wearing
leaves,'' he says with eyes twinkling, sending a group of
youngsters into a fit of laughter.
	   Three generations after those colonial explorers and
missionaries first penetrated the tangled wilderness, outsiders are
changing the lives of the Bongon as profoundly as pith-helmeted
Europeans once did.
	   A burgeoning wild game and ivory trade threatens the pygmies'
traditional livelihood as much as an expanding logging industry.
And prejudice deters the legendary hunters from leaving their
jungle refuge to seek work in towns.
	   ``I have always been a hunter. But if I want to go to the city
and become a house-builder or a craftsman, other people will stop
me: `No, you are a pygmy,''' says Avam Ngadi, a 41-year-old Bongon
who lives in Toumbi village.
	   Once nomads who roamed the forest wearing loincloths of leaves,
most Bongon now live more settled lives in villages of
grass-and-adobe huts similar to those of the taller Bantu tribes
that dominate much of sub-Saharan Africa.
	   But they are far from cosmopolitan. Toumbi, one of the most
accessible Bongon settlements in eastern Gabon, is reached only by
driving five hours along bone-jarring roads and two-rut tracks over
streams bridged by rotten logs.
	   There is a simple Roman Catholic mission school for the 100 or
so people who live in the village. Traders pass through
occasionally. Each visitor is a source of entertainment.
	   When a journalist visited recently in a rented pickup, dozens of
Bongon crammed into the truck for a lift to the next village,
playfully singing: ``This is the pygmy truck! This is the pygmy
truck!''
	   Pygmies, believed to be the earliest inhabitants of central
Africa, have throughout history retreated into woodland obscurity
from the taller, more powerful Bantu warriors and farmers.
	   Around 250,000 pygmies are believed to remain in central Africa.
Most continue to eke out livings as hunter-gatherers amid a growing
tide of modernization.
	   The Bongon, slender people whose average height is under 5 feet
(1.5 meters) and often only 4 (1.2 meters), rely on their size and
dexterity to succeed as forest hunters, using traditional spears,
bows and snares.
	   But where they once had the sea of trees and vines to
themselves, they now share it with commercial hunters armed with
high-powered rifles who sell their take in Gabon's capital,
Libreville.
	   Unsurprisingly, the numbers of big game animals have declined.
No one knows how many of the 60,000 elephants that roamed Gabon in
the 1980s remain, but environmentalists say hunters sometimes must
walk five days to find their prey when it once took only a single
day.
	   The commercial hunters are lured by the steep price of meat in
Gabon's major towns, where an oil boom in the 1980s brought cash.
Be it beef imported from France or ``bushmeat'' brought in from
Gabon's forests, meat is a lucrative commodity at city and town
markets.
	   Illicit trading in ivory also contributes to the wildlife
slaughter. Foreign buyers are known to aggressively seek elephant
tusks, although the trade is banned by an international treaty. The
``white gold'' mostly ends up in Asian markets.
	   Environmentalists say poaching regulations are rarely respected
or enforced. Many Gabonese are not aware that elephant and lowland
gorillas are threatened species.
	   To a lesser extent, the forestry industry also takes a toll on
the wildlife population.
	   Muriel Vives, spokeswoman for the African conservation group
EcoFac, says an expanding web of logging roads has given hunters
access to animals long protected by the jungle's isolation.
	   ``The logging itself is not moving at a great speed. But the new
roads allow commercial hunters to move even in protected areas, and
they are hunting more game,'' Vives says.
	   The World Wildlife Fund is lobbying for a huge nature reserve to
be set up in northeastern Gabon, although this seems unlikely.
Gabonese politicians and foreign companies have bought the logging
rights to large tracts of the region.
	   Adapting to the times, a few Bongon have begun selling the
spoils of their hunts _ everything from gorillas to iguanas and
rare birds. They advertise the carcasses on poles staked along
forest roads.
	   ``Those who want to go to town, buy clothes or cigarettes or
anything, they have to hunt more,'' Ngadi says.
	   A monkey fetches the equivalent of about dlrs 2, a small gazelle
perhaps dlrs 4. The meat can be resold in Libreville for 10 times
that amount.
	   ``I have no problem with subsistence hunting, but the commercial
bushmeat industry is wasteful and harmful,'' says Sally Lahm, an
American tropical ecologist who has lived in Gabon 15 years. ``Most
meat never makes it to market because it rots along the way.''
	   For the pygmies, hunting is a source of pride.
	   Young Bongon who venture into towns inhabited by the ``Assiya''
_ the name used by the Bongon to refer to all outsiders _ face
ridicule and contempt. Yet in the forest, no one is more at home
than pygmies.
	   ``We are laughed at by people who think they are superior,''
says Alba Uabouna, a 37-year-old Bongon who boasts of being able to
sneak up on an elephant and kill it from underneath with a spear.
	   ``But I know I am a better hunter than those people.''

The price of persuasion in Washington: dlrs 1.17 billion

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ From the mighty tobacco companies to the tiny
Northern Mariana Islands, special interests reported spending dlrs
1.17 billion last year to lobby the U.S. Congress, the White House
and the federal bureaucracy, according to the first computerized
study of year-end disclosure reports.
	   In all, companies, labor unions, interest groups and
municipalities reported hiring 14,484 lobbyists, an army that
outnumbers members of Congress 27-to-1, according to an Associated
Press computer analysis of lobbying disclosure reports.
	   The database, a joint project with the nonprofit, nonpartisan
Center for Responsive Politics, provides the most comprehensive
look at lobbying spending since federal disclosures began two years
ago. The 1997 figures are the latest on record.
	   The most heavily lobbied issues in 1997 were the federal budget,
taxes, health, transportation and defense, the analysis showed.
	   With budget cutbacks increasing competition for federal money,
more special interests are turning to professional lobbyists to
make their case. Some 42 percent of the lobbyists listed the budget
as one of their interest areas.
	   ``There are a lot of groups that depend very heavily on the
budget and the appropriations process,'' said Wright H. Andrews
Jr., a partner in the firm of Butera-and-Andrews and past president
of the American League of Lobbyists.
	   The king of the lobbying crowd in 1997 was the American Medical
Association, which reported spending dlrs 17.1 million.
	   The nation's doctor lobby is pressing to give patients and
doctors more freedom under managed care health plans, and for
legislation to reduce teen smoking.
	   Also lobbying on anti-smoking legislation was tobacco, beer and
food giant Philip Morris, the second-biggest spender at dlrs 15.8
million. Part of that was spent trying to persuade Congress to
ratify a dlrs 368 billion deal between the tobacco industry and a
group of state attorneys generals. After the deal was altered to
add a dlrs 1.10-per-pack tax that the tobacco companies opposed,
the Senate shelved it last month.
	   ``What we want to do with our lobbying is make our voice and our
view heard,'' Philip Morris spokeswoman Darienne Dennis said.
	   Overall, major tobacco industry players reported spending dlrs
31.65 million lobbying last year.
	   But that was only about half as much as the telecommunications
industry, which spent dlrs 63.96 million. In that industry, several
giants are seeking approval for mergers, and local telephone
companies and long distance companies are pressing to break into
each other's markets.
	   Other major categories included the pharmaceutical industry
(dlrs 59.7 million), oil and gas (dlrs 51.7 million), defense (dlrs
40 million), the automobile industry (dlrs 34.6 million) and
business groups (dlrs 24.6 million).
	   Major players in the computer industry, relative newcomers to
political giving and influence building in Washington, reported
spending about dlrs 12 million last year on lobbying. Microsoft
Corp., which is battling a Justice Department antitrust lawsuit and
a congressional investigation, was among the biggest spenders at
dlrs 1.9 million.
	   For all its high profile, Microsoft was outspent in 1997 by the
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S. territory in
the Pacific Ocean under fire for bringing in foreign garment
workers and paying them less than the federal minimum wage.
	   Though most of the factories are foreign-owned, the clothing can
be labeled, ``Made in USA.''
	   The Interior Department wants the islands to raise their dlrs
3.05-per-hour minimum wage to the federal level of dlrs 5.15.
	   The islands, which were seized from Japan during World War II
and have 64,000 residents, have enlisted some big-name help to make
their case. The islands spent dlrs 2 million in 1997 to hire two
heavyweight lobbying firms.
	   One of them employs former Senate majority leaders George
Mitchell and Bob Dole and former governors Ann Richards of Texas
and James Blanchard of Michigan. It reported 128 clients and dlrs
18.8 million in lobbying income last year.
	   The 1997 figures do not include the millions in campaign
contributions special interests make, nor the costs of growing
grass-roots lobbying efforts that generate letters, postcards or
telephone calls.

	   CHAPALA, Mexico (AP) _ Lake Chapala has played a key role in the
development of the region around Guadalajara over the decades.
	   It has provided water for millions of people, made gardens bloom
on the dusty plains of western Mexico and lured thousands of
Americans and their dollars to retirement communities along its
shore.
	   Now Mexico's biggest lake is in trouble. It is shrinking at the
rate of 74 acres (30 hectares) a day, because drought and water
extraction for nearby Guadalajara is sucking it dry.
	   Its surface area has decreased nearly 20 percent, to 328 square
miles (853 square kilometers). The average depth has dropped to
under 9 1-2 feet (2.8 meters) from 32 (9.7 meters).
	   Lake Chapala has survived a number of previous threats,
including being choked by water lilies that feed on fertilizers and
agricultural runoff. But it may not survive much longer, residents
and fishermen fear.
	   ``This is one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen, and
wanted to move here since I first saw it,'' said Hugh Robertson, an
American from New York who has lived in Mexico since retiring in
1987.
	   When Robertson moved here 3 1-2 years ago, the waterfront was a
few feet (meters) from his house. Today, the water is a
quarter-mile (half-kilometer) away.
	   ``I am saddened by the loss of the lake,'' he said.
	   The lake also is credited with helping keep temperatures mild on
what would otherwise be a baking plain.
	   ``I met people from Texas, Arizona and Florida who come to
Chapala escaping the heat in those states in the summer months.
They call themselves `the summer birds,''' said Lorena Otero, a
graduate student at a Mexican university doing research on the
lake.
	   Despite the lake's shrinkage, the Metropolitan Area Water
Authority announced in April that it was increasing water
extraction to nearly 2,000 gallons (7,600 liters) a second, the
maximum allowed by the federal government.
	   Lake Chapala already holds less than one-third of the water it
contained at its maximum size of 400 square miles (1,040 square
kilometers).
	   ``Of the 9 million cubic meters we had 10 years ago, we only
have 2.5 million left, and that is decreasing quickly,'' said Jorge
Dipp Murad, a local businessman and environmental activist.
	   Many residents say their dreams are being stolen along with the
lake.
	   Politicians have repeatedly promised drastic measures to protect
the lake. But little has been done, said Ruth Boyes, a native of
Wisconsin who learned about Lake Chapala through her public library
and has lived in the area since 1974.
	   ``It gets started, then it drags. Then there'll be an election
and it will start again,'' she said. ``My whole reaction is one of
discouragement.''
	   The lakeside area, including the towns of Chapala, Ajijic and
Jocotepec, is home to more than 10,000 Americans and Canadians
drawn by the beauty of the lake and the mild climate.
	   The administration of Jalisco Gov. Alberto Cardenas draws much
criticism for the lake's problems, but other states have also
contributed to its decline.
	   Lake Chapala's main source of water, the Lerma River, flows
though five states, including Jalisco, before reaching the lake. A
1989 agreement among the five states restricted water extraction
from the river, but has been largely ignored.
	   ``The citizens of this community have been asking the government
to do something for years,'' said Dale Palfrey, a long-time
lakeside resident. ``There are a lot of meetings, a lot of
organizations, a lot of talk, but there have been no concrete
actions.''
	   Yet many say they will continue the struggle.
	   ``It's very essential that Lake Chapala survive,'' said George
Cardis, who moved here from Chicago three years ago. ``If the lake
wasn't there, there would be serious consequences for the
environment and the climate. There's still time to do something, if
there's enough political will.''

After 30 years, farmers still block completion of Tokyo airport

	   NARITA, Japan (AP) _ Shoji Shimamura will never forget the day
in 1966 when the government said it wanted to tear down his
family's chicken farm to make way for a new airport.
	   The bureaucrats in Tokyo hadn't even bothered to notify him and
the other landowners in Narita, then a quiet rural town best known
for its ancient Buddhist temple. Shimamura learned of the decision
from the evening news.
	   ``The bureaucrats treated us like dirt,'' he says. ``Their
attitude was that we were just a bunch of peasants who would meekly
submit.''
	   The government was painfully wrong. It took a long, violent
battle just to open a scaled-down airport.
	   And three decades later, officials are still trying to get
farmers to let them build the second of three runways originally
planned. In the meantime, Japan's main international airport
remains one of the most congested, inefficient travel hubs in the
world.
	   ``Some said we couldn't win, that no one can stand in the way of
the bureaucrats,'' Shimamura said. ``To be honest, at the start I
thought we would last four, maybe five years at most.''
	   Officials acknowledge that Narita is in desperate need of
expansion.
	   Every day, 340 flights carrying 70,000 passengers and 4,000 tons
of freight must use the same runway. At peak times, aircraft
alternate between takeoff and landing once every two minutes.
	   But, from the start, the showdown over the airport has been a
disaster for the government.
	   ``There wasn't a democratic process, so the people got angry,''
said Kiyoshi Hamakawa, a law professor at Tokyo's Hosei University.
``Democracy would have strengthened the government's hand.''
	   In the 1970s, when Japan was already being rocked by student
unrest and protests against the military alliance with the United
States, the sight of a few dozen farmers standing up against
bulldozers and riot police struck a nerve in a population sick of
genuflecting to heavy-handed public servants.
	   Supporters came flowing into Narita, 65 kilometers (40 miles)
northeast of Tokyo, when the airport authority began eviction
proceedings against farmers who refused to move.
	   The conflict attracted the far left, which helped the Narita
farmers build walls and plant pointed sticks to repel the police
sent to drag them from their homes.
	   Authorities were able to open one runway and one terminal using
land that already was owned by the government or had been sold by
some farmers. But they couldn't force others off land needed for
the bigger airport envisioned.
	   The violence strengthened sympathy for the farmers. The pressure
grew so strong politicians balked. The police were forced to back
away _ but the standoff continued.
	   Even into this decade, police manned steel towers behind barbed
wire fences while the farmers and their allies kept watch from
towers made of plywood and a network of underground bunkers.
	   Sporadic attacks by leftist radical groups against the airport
or related targets continue. Early in June, a predawn explosion
destroyed two buses used to ferry passengers to the airport.
Another bomb exploded at the home of an airport official in April.
No one was hurt in either blast.
	   Because of the violence, the airport was one of the most tightly
guarded in the industrial world when it finally opened in 1978,
seven years late, and continues to have a strong police presence.
	   The tone of the standoff has cooled, however.
	   The airport authority announced in 1991 that it was
relinquishing the use of force and would try to get the farmers'
land only by negotiation.
	   ``The attempts at compulsory expropriation weren't defeated by
the farmers. They were defeated by the public,'' says Kozo Komine,
a spokesman for the Narita International Airport Authority.
	   Officials from the airport authority say they want to open the
second runway in 2000 and have already begun clearing a swath of
land.
	   Only Shimamura, who is 51, and three other families stand in
their way. Shimamura says officials come once a month to chat, sip
green tea _ and patiently tell him that selling his land would be a
service to his country.
	   He says the pleas fall on deaf ears.
	   A brand new second terminal stands right behind his farm, and
the stench of jet fuel is so strong it overwhelms the farm's
natural odors of mulch and manure.
	   ``Look what they have done to me,'' Shimamura says, turning
toward the huge tail fin of an All Nippon Airways jetliner towering
over his fields. ``I'm going to fight them to the end.''

Australian Senate restricts Aboriginal land rights
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Recaps previous, updates with final passage of bill &QL; 
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The Senate on Wednesday voted to
restrict Aborigines' land claims, ending the immediate threat of an
early election and ushering in a new phase in a bitter debate that
has divided the nation.
	   After more than 100 hours of debate over numerous sessions _ the
longest debate in the Parliament's 97-year history _ the Senate
voted to accept the conservative government's bill to restrict
Aborigines' rights to claim a form of traditional land title
recognized by common law.
	   Aborigines immediately vowed to challenge the new law in the
courts, throwing into doubt the government's claim that it will
provide certainty of tenure to ranchers, farmers and miners.
	   Despite government assurances, the new law is unlikely to end
six years of bitter wrangling over native title.
	   The debate started in 1992 when the country's most powerful
judicial body, the High Court, ruled that native title rights still
exist in Australia in certain limited circumstances.
	   This reversed a previous legal fiction of ``terra nullius,''
which held that Australia was an empty land when the first white
settlers arrived in 1788.
	   In its ruling on the Wik case in 1996, the High Court
established that Aborigines could have access to the vast lands
that the government leases long-term to ranchers, farmers and
miners, which cover some 42 percent of Australia.
	   After his election in 1996, Howard said the native title laws
were unworkable and introduced comprehensive amendments to restrict
them.
	   He said his 10-point plan would give ranchers certainty over
their leased land. Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer said the bill
contained ``bucketloads of extinguishment'' of native title.
	   The bill was twice blocked in the Senate, pushing Howard to the
brink of calling an early election to solve the impasse.
	   But with his government trailing badly in opinion polls, Howard
returned to talks with key independent Sen. Brian Harradine.
	   Harradine feared an election called on Wik would lead to a
damaging and divisive campaign on race issues, while Howard feared
the right-wing populist One Nation party could attract enough votes
away from his ruling coalition to hold the balance of power in the
Senate.
	   The final vote was 35-33 in the closely divided Upper House, as
was expected after a deal reached last week between Howard and
Harradine.
	   Aboriginal representative Aden Ridgeway said Aborigines did not
want to continue the uncertainty over native title by taking the
new law to court, but they now felt they had no choice.
	   ``We have gone through the processes as best we can in
Parliament, the government hasn't listened to what we have said,''
Ridgeway told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   ``What we are seeking is an alternative and that is to go to the
courts.''
	   The courts have provided the few advances in land claims rights
that Aborigines have won in recent years. Aborigines account for
some 386,000 of Australia's 18 million people, a tiny minority in
the political process.
	   Their difficulties in winning outright title to Australian land
stands in contrast to the relative success of New Zealand's Maoris,
who now own much of the North Island's resources, or Canada's Inuit
people, who recently won dominion over the Arctic north reaches of
that country.

Protestants protest, riot for third night over blocked Orange

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Tensions continued to simmer
over the blocking of a Protestant parade through a Catholic
neighborhood in the town of Portadown.
	   Late Tuesday, angry members of the Orange Order paraded
illegally through Belfast and blocked roads across Northern Ireland
in hopes of forcing British authorities to let their fellow
Protestants march through Portadown's Catholic enclave.
	   The parade, originally scheduled for Sunday, was banned in
Portadown, a fiercely Protestant town 30 miles (50 kms) southwest
of Belfast. The ban has set Northern Ireland alight for the third
summer in a row.
	   After dark, several thousand Orangemen and their supporters
massed peacefully at Drumcree Anglican church outside Portadown,
where the parade ran into British army-erected barricades shortly
before it was due to pass Catholic homes along the town's Garvaghy
Road.
	   The Orangemen _ who have pitched tents and entertained
themselves with barbeques, politicians' orations and traditional
Protestant bands _ say they will stay there until the authorities
relent.
	   In 1996, the last time that police blocked the march at
Drumcree, they had to give up after four nights of intensifying
Protestant violence and force the Orangemen past furious Catholics
down Garvaghy Road.
	   The Rev. Ian Paisley, chief opponent of April's peace accord
outlining a compromise government for Northern Ireland, said he was
confident that the Orangemen would be allowed down Garvaghy Road
again this year.
	   He said it would be ``far better'' if authorities redeployed
police and troops against the Garvaghy Road Catholics before
Sunday, the eve of the Orangemen's biggest annual celebrations
across Northern Ireland, when they commemorate the 1690 victory of
the Protestant King William of Orange over the Catholic James II.
	   David Trimble and Seamus Mallon, the Protestant and Catholic
politicians jointly heading Northern Ireland's new cross-community
government, worked behind the scenes to inch Portadown's Orange
leaders and members of the Garvaghy Road Residents Coalition closer
together.
	   Mallon, deputy leader of the north's moderate Catholic party,
consulted with Garvaghy Road protest leader Breandan MacCionnaith,
who has tried unsuccessfully since 1995 to get the annual parade
barred from the area.
	   And Ulster Unionist leader Trimble, an Orangeman himself, went
inside an Orange Hall to talk with Portadown's Orange leaders, who
refuse to meet MacCionnaith because he's a former Irish Republican
Army prisoner.
	   Before the meetings, Mallon said he and Trimble ``have embarked
upon a seemingly impossible task'' to broker compromise.
	   Police statisticians said in the first 36 hours of rioting up to
Tuesday morning, 42 police officers were injured, 101 vehicles
stolen and burned, and there were 330 separate occasions when mobs
bombarded police and soldiers with gasoline bombs. They arrested 63
rioters over the period.
	   After dark Tuesday sporadic violence resumed. Protestants
attacked police and soldiers, ambushed passing drivers and forced
them to surrender their cars to join burning road barricades, and
burned Catholic properties in predominantly Protestant areas.
	   In the worst attack, arsonists struck St. Joseph's Catholic
elementary school in predominantly Protestant Lisburn, a southwest
Belfast suburb that is also headquarters of the British army in
Northern Ireland.
	   Orangemen and supporters formed human barricades across roads
sporadically across Belfast and in a dozen mostly Protestant towns.
In some places they only allowed cars through if their drivers
could prove they were members of the 203-year-old fraternal group.
	   Orangemen, many donning their old-fashioned uniform of suit,
umbrella and bowler hat, set off from three directions in Belfast.
The surprise parades snarled traffic and were illegal, since police
require 28 days' advance notification.
	   Riot police scuffled with Orangemen leading one 1,000-strong
parade outside City Hall, but let it continue to the offices of the
British Broadcasting Corp. and Ulster Television. Orange officials
handed in letters protesting that news broadcasts weren't devoting
enough attention to their nonviolent protests.
	   Another parade passed along south Belfast's Sandy Row and
Donegall Road districts, both scenes of severe rioting Sunday and
Monday. They passed the still-smoldering remains of a city bus
hijacked a few hours earlier, but police stopped them when they
tried to cross Northern Ireland's major highway and enter Catholic
west Belfast.
	   The third down east Belfast's Newtownards Road passed near the
isolated Catholic enclave of Short Strand, but soldiers erected
high tarpaulin screens to prevent the two sides from seeing each
other.

Wholesale prices in Japan drop from last year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In a sign of deflation in the Japanese economy,
overall wholesale prices fell 0.3 percent in June from the same
month last year, the Bank of Japan reported Wednesday.
	   The figures follow a similar trend in May, when prices fell 1.7
percent from the same month a year earlier.
	   Breaking down the figures, June domestic wholesale prices _
which does not include import prices _ were 2.1 percent lower than
in the same month last year, the bank said.
	   The bank reported the prices of Japan's booming exports soared
10.4 percent in June, while import prices were up only 2 percent.
	   The dollar traded at an average 140.58 yen during the latest
reporting month, with the yen weakening 4.1 percent from May and
depreciating 23 percent from a year earlier.
	   The deflationary figures follow a year of stagnating consumer
demand in Japan. While consumers enjoy lower prices, deflation can
devastate an economy by leading to production cuts and layoffs.

	   LONDON (AP) _ One-third of the world's children are jinxed at
birth because they aren't officially registered, the U.N.
children's agency said Wednesday in its annual report.
	   Without proof of birth, some 40 million children born each year
often can't enter school, receive health care or immunizations, get
married, own land, vote or obtain a passport, the report said.
	   The absence of an official certificate is especially serious for
children displaced by war, famine or natural disaster, it said.
	   ``These children are denied their birthright by their very
invisibility,'' said the report, written by Botswana High Court
Judge Unity Dow. ``Lacking birth certificates, they spend their
lives on the edge of the `official' world, skirting or falling over
obstacles that never arise in the paths of those who had the good
fortune to be registered when they were born.''
	   A birth certificate is a child's first right _ the right to an
official identity and nationality guaranteed in the 1989 Convention
on the Rights of the Child, UNICEF said. The convention has been
ratified by every country except Somalia and the United States.
	   ``This ticket to citizenship opens the door to the fulfillment
of rights and to the privileges and services that a nation offers
to its people,'' the report said.
	   Without a birth certificate, a child cannot receive health care
in more than 30 countries or be legally vaccinated in at least 20
countries, UNICEF said. Most countries demand to see a birth
certificate before enrolling a child in school.
	   Proof of birth can protect children _ for example, proving that
a boy is ineligible for military service or a girl is too young to
go to work, it said.
	   Some countries haven't even established a mandatory birth
registration system, among them Afghanistan, Cambodia, Eritrea,
Ethiopia, Namibia and Oman. And 22 nations have no available data
on birth registration, UNICEF said.
	   According to the report, a country's birth registration system
may fail to function for all its people by accident or design.
	   In Myanmar, for example, full citizenship is granted only to
people who can prove continuous residence and no intermarriage back
to their great-grandfathers.
	   Poor and rural countries tend to have lower rates: Sierra Leone
has a birth registration rate of less than 10 percent, Zimbabwe
registers about one-third of births, and Bolivia about a half,
UNICEF said.
	   Yet eight countries facing economic difficulties manage to
register at least 90 percent of births _ Armenia, Azerbaijan,
China, Honduras, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Sri Lanka and Tajikistan,
the report said.
	   The report, The Progress of Nations 1998, also hailed the
dramatic increase in the percentage of infants vaccinated against
six major child-killing diseases _ 80 percent today compared with 5
percent in 1980.
	   New vaccines will be capable of saving up to 8 million more
lives a year, but UNICEF said a lack of commitment by donors and
governments of developing countries _ mainly because of the dlrs
700 million annual cost _ could preclude these vaccines getting to
those youngsters most in need.
	   And it asked: ``Could the reason be that these 8 million are,
overwhelmingly, the unseen, unheard children of the poor?''

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ The death of Nigeria's most prominent
political prisoner, Moshood Abiola, came just as the end of his
imprisonment seemed near, causing the latest shockwave in a
turbulent month for Africa's most-populous nation.
	   Abiola died of an apparent heart attack Tuesday after suddenly
becoming ill during a meeting with U.S. diplomats who came to push
for his freedom.
	   His death came just as freedom after four years in prison seemed
imminent. The dictator who had jailed him died June 8, of a heart
attack.
	   The news prompted demonstrators Tuesday to vent their fury in
the streets, throwing rocks and burning debris in the roads. A
former backer of Nigeria's military regime who later ran on his own
for president on an anti-poverty platform, Abiola became a hero of
pro-democracy activists.
	   A U.S. State Department official said Abiola began coughing and
wheezing during a meeting with a delegation led by U.S.
Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering.
	   Pickering said Abiola became ill in the early stages of their
meeting and asked for a doctor.
	   ``We all helped to put him in a car. There was no ambulance
immediately available,'' Pickering said in an interview with CNN.
	   Abiola had been drinking tea and chatting before he fell ill,
said Jim Callahan, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria.
	   In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton said U.S. officials
watched Nigerian doctors' last-ditch efforts to save Abiola's life
at a government clinic. Clinton expressed regret at the ``sudden
and untimely'' death.
	   A Nigerian government statement said the cause of death was a
heart attack, and the State Department said there was no reason to
believe that the death was not the result of natural causes.
Abiola's family had repeatedly warned that his health had been
failing after years in detention under harsh conditions, but cast
doubt on the official explanation of his death.
	   His daughter, Hafsat, said in an interview with CNN that the
timing was suspicious.
	   ``It was too convenient,'' she said. ``All of a sudden at the
eve of his release, he dies.''
	   Abiola was the apparent winner of the 1993 presidential
elections that were canceled by the military. He was jailed the
following year and accused of treason by dictator Gen. Sani Abacha,
who died last month of a heart attack.
	   Dissidents also have complained that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan and other diplomats refused to stand up for Abiola _ and said
the secretary-general pressured Abiola into renouncing his claim to
the presidency.
	   Annan also was criticized for not going to Lagos, Nigeria's
commercial center where much of the country's opposition movement
is centered. Annan did meet with opposition groups in Abuja, the
capital.
	   The U.S. delegation did not plan to visit Lagos either. The
delegation was to hold a small meeting with civilian leaders,
including some opposition figures, said Charles Patterson, the
principal officer at the U.S. Embassy in Abuja.
	   American-Nigerian relations have been poor in recent years,
particularly after Abacha executed playwright and pro-democracy
activist Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other people in November 1995.
	   But since taking power, the new military leader, Gen. Abdulsalam
Abubakar has surprised and pleased the United States by releasing
some political prisoners and pledging that all eventually will be
freed.
	   An unlikely hero for democracy, Abiola became a rallying point
for Nigeria's disparate opposition groups during his years of
imprisonment.
	   Grief and sorrow swept across the country as news of his death
spread among his supporters.
	   In the commercial capital of Lagos, news of Abiola's death was
met with isolated incidents of stone throwing.
	   Just north of Lagos, however, in the university town of Ibadan,
students took to the streets in a show of outrage over Abiola's
death while still in military custody. There were no immediate
reports of arrests or injuries linked to the protests.
	   Abiola grew up in a poor family and earned a degree in economics
from the University of Glasgow in Scotland. He later amassed a
fortune in industries including publishing, shipping, and oil.
	   He worked for the International Telephone and Telegraph Corp.,
serving as company chairman for Africa and the Middle East from
1971 to 1988. Some Nigerians blamed him for the country's appalling
telephone system, saying he made millions by using inferior
materials and pocketing the extra money. Abiola denied the
accusations.
	   Nigeria was shunned internationally during Abacha's harsh rule,
under which political jailings were rampant; between 250 and 280
people are believed still held across Nigeria. All are kept in
regular prisons except for Abiola, who was detained in the relative
comfort of a government guest house in Abuja.
	   Corruption in Abacha's Nigeria left the economy and
infrastructure in shambles.

Strong quake shakes northern Philippines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A strong earthquake rocked remote
northern Philippine islands before dawn Wednesday, but there were
no immediate reports of damage.
	   The earthquake, with a magnitude of 5.2, struck at around 2:30
a.m. (1830 GMT Tuesday) north of Calayan island, about 600
kilometers (375 miles) north of Manila, the Philippine Institute of
Volcanology and Seismology said.
	   The earthquake was tectonic in origin and the epicenter was
located about 30 kilometers (48 miles) below the Luzon Strait.
	   Though the quake was strong enough to damage poorly built
structures, the area hit is one of the most sparsely populated
islands in the Philippines and no damage was expected, the
institute said.

Asian crisis to worsen as Japan recession bites, forecaster warns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ The Asian economic crisis will
worsen as the full effects of Japan's recession and falling
currency are felt, New Zealand's Asia 2000 Foundation warned in a
report released Wednesday.
	   A return to pre-crisis levels of economic activity will take
three to five years, ``perhaps longer,'' the report said.
	   The regional nature of the crisis, the extreme shortage of
liquidity in the region, the magnitude of difficulties in the
corporate and banking sectors and the sharp contraction in Japan's
economy all contributed to a much worse situation in Asia than had
been expected, the report said.
	   ``Even if growth resumes in the next two to three years, it may
take another two to three years beyond that for economies to
recover to their pre-crisis levels,'' said Phillip Porter, manager
of policy development and economics for Asia 2000, a trade
promotion organization.
	   The report said a stable, growing and open United States market
was vital for Asia's recovery.
	   ``The future outlook of Asia remains uncertain, with almost no
one claiming with any confidence to know what is happening in the
region,'' it said.
	   ``This being said ... economies in Asia will turn around and
resume growth again.
	   The report noted that falling currencies in Asian countries had
not yet sparked an export-led recovery in the region.
	   But an expected improvement in the availability of trade finance
should increase export levels in the second half of 1998.
	   The Asia 2000 Foundation, jointly funded by the government and
the private sector, was set up by the Government in 1994 to develop
New Zealanders' knowledge and understanding of Asia.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Union leaders hinted strikers would
take more bold action Wednesday to cap the biggest labor protest in
the history of Puerto Rico.
	   Tens of thousands of protesters began a 48-hour general strike
against the sale of the state telephone company Tuesday by
dramatically blocking a main highway and its entry to San Juan's
international airport with hundreds of cars.
	   Gunmen strafed a bank involved in buying the telephone utility;
protesters planted a bomb that was harmlessly exploded by police
outside a provincial branch of the same bank; and saboteurs slashed
telephone cables, leaving 260,000 people without long-distance
service.
	   ``We will start our activities at 4 a.m.,'' promised Annie Cruz,
president of one of the two telephone workers' unions. She refused
to give details for ``strategic reasons.''
	   ``The fight doesn't end here. It's just beginning,'' Sen. Ruben
Berrios of the U.S. territory's Independence Party told a sea of
protesters Tuesday waving the island's single-star red, white and
blue flag.
	   Opposition politicians and union leaders accuse Gov. Pedro
Rossello of ``selling off the national patrimony'' in a dlrs 1.9
billion deal to a consortium led by the U.S. giant GTE Corp. and
the local Banco Popular.
	   The governor's opponents say the privatization is part of his
campaign to make the Caribbean island the 51st U.S. state. Most
opponents want Puerto Rico to remain a U.S. commonwealth.
	   The government says state enterprises cannot compete in the new
deregulated markets and already has sold hotels and a shipping
company and transferred management of prisons and hospitals to
private companies.
	   Rossello wants to follow the telephone sale with those of other
utilities, which would further weaken the waning power of unions
that are strongest among the 300,000 government workers.
	   Pro-statehood groups in newspaper advertisements Tuesday
denounced the strike as a political bid to frighten away foreign
investment and signal that the Caribbean island is too unstable to
be admitted to the union.
	   Labor leaders said they hoped the strike would persuade the
government to hold a referendum of the telephone sale. But Rossello
told reporters the only referendum on the island would be one for
statehood that already has been approved by the U.S. House of
Representatives and awaits the decision of the Senate.
	   Telephone workers, who began an indefinite strike June 18, say
they fear for their jobs. Like many state enterprises, the company
is top-heavy with 6,400 workers controlled by 1,400 managers in
positions often created to reward political supporters.
	   Some 60 unions called the general strike to support the
telephone workers.
	   Tuesday's protests were largely peaceful with only a few
confrontations between police and strikers.
	   The telephone strike has cost Puerto Rico as much as dlrs 100
million, and the general strike could multiply that figure, said
Santos Negron, a leading economist and former member of the
government planning board.
	   Near the airport Tuesday, many tourists sweated in the tropical
heat as they dragged their luggage through the blockade of honking
cars.
	   ``Well, I'm never coming here again!'' Spanish tourist Felipe de
Andrea said as protesters helped him heft bags over the freeway
divider. Riot police carried them to a police van that took him and
others to the terminal.
	   LIAT Airlines canceled all flights, and at least two cruise
ships canceled port calls. Hotel owners said hundreds of tourists
have canceled vacations.
	   In the last general strike in Puerto Rico, tens of thousands of
sugar cane cutters stopped working in 1934 to demand better
conditions.

participate in the autopsy and called for physicians from Britain
and Canada to take part.
	   ``This is not something I can take part in, at least for now,
and we are contacting the Commonwealth Medical Association to be
involved in the any autopsy,'' Falomo said.

Weiss and son share starry night
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN MOSSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ Two weeks ago, as he lay near death in a hospital,
it would have been unthinkable. But there in the stands at Coors
Field on Tuesday night was Brody Weiss, 3-year-old son of Atlanta
shortstop Walt Weiss.
	   Brody, sitting with his mother, Terri, was there to watch his
father play in the 69th All-Star game, the first time in Weiss'
11-year major-league career that he has been named to play in the
midsummer classic.
	   When dad was introduced with the rest of the NL All-Stars before
the game, Brody, sitting on mom's lap, smiled. Then, after Walt
singled off Toronto's Roger Clemens in the third for the NL's first
hit, Brody clapped with some help from mom.
	   Brody continued to make progress toward what doctors believe
will be a full recovery from a life-threatening strain of E. coli
bacteria, which he contracted from contaminated water at an Atlanta
water park.
	   His kidneys shut down and he was on dialysis, and he appeared
headed for a coma, which was the fate of two other children who
were playing at the park that day.
	   After four sleepless, unbearable nights, the Weisses learned
their son would recover. And instead of spending at least a month
at Atlanta's Scottish Rite Children's Hospital, Brody was released
in about 10 days.
	   In that context, the All-Star game takes on diminished
significance in Weiss' eyes.
	   ``Is there a game tonight?'' Weiss said Tuesday dressing for
batting practice. ``The game has been the last thing on my mind. I
haven't even thought about the game. Sure, it's a special game, but
I look at it with a different perspective.''
	   Asked if it would be difficult to concentrate in the game, Weiss
said, ``Yeah, probably. You just go out there and instinctively
play baseball. You try to react and rely on your instincts.''
	   Asked if his son understood the significance of the game, Weiss
said, ``I don't think he really grasps what is going on. He's
pretty young.''
	   Doctors were concerned about Brody's exposure to bacteria while
flying on a commercial jet from Atlanta to Denver, so Colorado
owner Jerry McMorris offered the Weiss family the use of his
private jet to make the trip easier. Weiss played for the Rockies
from 1994-97.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; WORN OUT: &LR;  The day after winning the Home Run Derby, Ken
Griffey Jr. sat at his locker in a T-shirt featuring a large
bulls-eye. It read, ``Hit It Here Junior.''
	   ``I'm tired,'' Griffey said. But his fatigue didn't stem from
the derby that took more than two hours to complete.
	   He had writer's cramp.
	   Griffey, by his estimation, signed more than 600 baseballs
Tuesday as part of the All-Star routine.
	   ``Let's see you go sign all the balls down there,'' Griffey
said.
	   Griffey's initial reluctance to competing in Monday night's Home
Run Derby stemmed from how tired he might be because the Mariners
travel more than any team in the majors.
	   Asked if he would like to see the derby shortened, Griffey said
he didn't care. ``It's up to whoever,'' Griffey said. ``I just went
out there and did the best I could.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; CLASS ACT: &LR;  Cleveland shortstop Omar Vizquel showed he's an
All-Star off the field, too.
	   On his flight to Denver for his first All-Star appearance,
Vizquel gave up his seat in first class to a local 15-year-old girl
who had hurt her knee while playing in a softball tournament in
Kansas City.
	   Stretched ligaments in her knee had forced Rachel Dando to wear
a large brace during the trip home, and because of discomfort, she
had to stand in the plane's aisle in coach.
	   That's when Vizquel came to her rescue.
	   ``There was a girl with a brace on her knee,'' he said. ``She
was sitting way in back and it was hard for her to move around. She
looked uncomfortable. I know the pain. I know how it feels. I had a
first-class seat and I asked her if she wanted to sit there. She
seemed to enjoy that.''

Government ordered to return land in binding compensation ruling
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAY LILLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ In an unprecedented move, the
government was ordered Wednesday to return more than U.S. dlrs 3
million (6.1 million NZ dollars) worth of land confiscated from its
Maori owners more than 30 years ago.
	   The land was taken to make housing for workers on a construction
project in the central North Island.
	   The binding order, from the government-appointed Waitangi
Tribunal, comes after negotiations between local Maori of the Ngati
Turangitukua sub-tribe and the government failed to reach
agreement.
	   It is the first time the tribunal has exercised its powers to
make such compulsory recommendations. The tribunal was established
to resolve grievances by indigenous Maori over land confiscated,
stolen or otherwise taken by the government and its agencies since
1840.
	   The land on which the Turangi hydro village stands was taken as
headquarters for the labor force working on the Tongariro electric
power project near Lake Taupo in central North Island.
	   Some of the land involved has since been sold by the government
to private owners.
	   When it took the land compulsorily from Maori, the government
already owned land nearby that would have been suitable, the
tribunal confirmed.
	   Wednesday's development comes two years after a substantive
report that found the sub-tribe's claim to the land was well
founded and the government had breached several principles of the
country's founding document, the Treaty of Waitangi.
	   The 1840 Treaty of Waitangi establishes British sovereignty over
New Zealand in exchange for a promise to allow the Maori
inhabitants to retain ``full possession'' of their lands, forests,
fisheries and other resources.
	   The tribunal had earlier recommended that the claimants and the
government negotiate an outcome, but the parties failed to reach
agreement.
	   As well as ordering the land returned, the tribunal recommended
the government ``make appropriate monetary compensation'' of at
least U.S. dlrs 500,000 (1 million NZ dollars) to the claimants.
	   The tribunal said its ``binding recommendations'' on remedies
for the Ngati Turangitukua people were ``interim'' but would become
final if the parties failed to agree after a further 90 days.
	   Minister of Treaty Negotiations Doug Graham said if no agreement
is reached with the sub-tribe, the government will use the Public
Works Act to take back land it has sold to private owners which is
needed for the settlement.
	   Under New Zealand law, such land carries specific notices or
``memorials'' on its title, warning buyers it may be required for
such settlements.
	   Graham said this meant anyone who bought a property would have
been aware the tribunal could force the government to buy it for
return to Maori.

Hungry dingoes stalking people
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Hungry dingoes near the central
Queensland coast are stalking residents in their hunt for food, but
authorities say they are powerless to step in.
	   Rockhampton deputy mayor Jim Rundle said Wednesday that the
native wild dogs from the Mount Archer National Park on the city's
eastern boundary are causing problems in nearby suburbs.
	   Residents had been complaining about packs of dingoes wandering
through suburbs looking for food.
	   One man complained that dingoes stalked him as he walked along a
road but authorities had been unable to help.
	   ``You can't bait within two kilometers (1.2 miles) of a
residence ... you can't shoot in a residential area, plus with the
gun laws, no-one's got a gun anyway,'' Rundle told Australian
Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   Several people were attacked by dingoes on Fraser Island
recently and National Parks officers moved in and shot the
offending animals.
	   In the most celebrated claim of a dingo attack, Lindy
Chamberlain claimed ``A dingo took my baby'' in August 1980 when
9-week-old Azaria Chamberlain disappeared and was later found dead.
	   That touched off debate in Australia which rages to this day
over whether a dingo, a fairly small to medium sized dog, is
capable of carrying off an infant or would be aggressive enough to
attack.
	   Lindy and her husband Michael Chamberlain were imprisoned on
murder and accessory to murder charges in the case, but were later
released and their convictions quashed when new evidence showed a
dingo may indeed have killed the infant.

South Korean defense chief to meet Cohen

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Defense Minister Chun Yong-taek left
for Washington Wednesday for security talks with U.S. Defense
Secretary William S. Cohen.
	   Chun's talks with Cohen, scheduled for Thursday, will include
discussion of the recent intrusion of a North Korean submarine into
South Korean waters, Defense Ministry officials said.
	   A 70-ton, Yugo-class submarine was captured off South Korea's
east coast on June 22, tangled in a fishing net. Its nine occupants
were later found dead in an apparent murder-suicide.
	   North Korea insisted that the sub strayed into the South with
mechanical problems but Seoul said it was on an espionage mission.
	   Chun also will visit the Center for Strategic and International
Studies on Friday and speak on the latest military situation on the
Korean peninsula, ministry officials said.
	   On his way home, Chun will stop over in Honolulu next Monday to
inspect a multinational Rim of the Pacific maritime exercise.
	   Over 5,400 military personnel from Australia, Canada, Chile,
Japan and South Korea, along with 21,700 U.S. troops, are taking
part in the month-long exercise.

Bengals sign O'Donnell
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CINCINNATI (AP) _ The Cincinnati Bengals on Tuesday signed free
agent quarterback Neil O'Donnell to a four-year contract worth dlrs
17 million.
	   ``We've admired Neil as a player for quite a few years,''
Bengals president and general manager Mike Brown said Tuesday
night. ``He's a tough quarterback who has played in a lot of big
games, and we have a great deal of respect for what he has been
able to achieve in the NFL.''
	   The Bengals wouldn't release terms of the contract, but
O'Donnell's agent, Leigh Steinberg, said Tuesday that it includes a
signing bonus of nearly dlrs 3.8 million and a first-year salary of
dlrs 1.5 million, for a total of nearly dlrs 5.3 million in the
first year of the deal.
	   O'Donnell and Steinberg arrived in Cincinnati on Tuesday to work
out the final details of the deal. O'Donnell also had to pass a
Bengals physical examination.
	   ``Any time you can acquire a veteran of Neil's caliber, it's a
good thing for your team,'' said Bengals coach Bruce Coslet, who
met last week with O'Donnell in New York.
	   At the team's minicamp in May, Coslet said Jeff Blake would be
the starter and Paul Justin would be the backup. But now the
Bengals are hoping that O'Donnell, 32, will challenge Blake, 27,
for the starting job.
	   ``When I talked to him, I told him I wasn't guaranteeing him
anything,'' Coslet said of O'Donnell. ``I told Jeff this and I told
Neil this. If Jeff plays like he did last year, then Neil would
beat him out. If Jeff plays like he did two years ago, then he
(Neil) wouldn't beat him out.''
	   The Jets cut O'Donnell last month.
	   O'Donnell, an eight-year veteran, knows the Bengals after
spending six years (1990-95) with their AFC Central Division
rivals, the Pittsburgh Steelers. He led Pittsburgh to the Super
Bowl ending the 1995 season.

Dollar falls, Tokyo stock prices gain in early trading
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late morning dollar-yen rate and stock and bond
prices

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The yen gained against the U.S. dollar Wednesday
morning on growing expectation Japan will cut taxes to spur
economic growth. Tokyo share prices advanced moderately.
	   The dollar bought 138.54 yen in late morning, down 1.29 yen from
late Tuesday in Tokyo and below its late New York rate of 138.75
yen overnight.
	   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto was scheduled to hold a news
conference in Nagoya, central Japan, later Wednesday, where he was
expected to announce tax cuts, the mass-circulation Yomiuri
newspaper said.
	   On the Tokyo exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose
130.77 points, or 0.80 percent, to close morning trading at
16,547.05 points. On Tuesday, the Nikkei index closed up 65.83
points, or 0.40 percent.
	   Markets participants hope tax cuts will bolster consumer demand
and pull Japan out of its deepest recession since World War II.
	   On Tuesday, Hiromu Nonaka, a senior ruling Liberal Democratic
Party official, said the prime minister was definitely going to
call for cutting some taxes.
	   A national sales tax increase and tighter fiscal policy by
Hashimoto's party last year have been widely blamed as a source of
Japan's economic troubles.
	   Hashimoto will visit Nagoya to campaign for Sunday's elections
for the upper house of Parliament. According to recent newspaper
polls, Hashimoto's party is not expected to gain a majority of
seats in the upper house.
	   A weak performance at the polls could prompt a change in
government leadership, analysts have said. And traders said such a
change would likely be welcomed by Japanese markets.
	   ``Players are looking for new leadership, and they think that if
Hashimoto stays as prime minister after the election, nothing will
change,'' said Jon Yang, a salesman in the futures and options
group at Jardine Fleming Securities.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 5.46 points, or 0.43 percent, to 1,270.27. The
TOPIX closed up 6.36 points, or 0.51 percent, the day before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.355 percent from Tuesday's finish of
1.305 percent, driving its price down to 110.77 yen from 111.15
yen.

Japanese architect Nagao dies of cancer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Yoriko Nagao, an architect who designed a
futuristic complex of buildings in Tokyo, has died of lung cancer
after years of illness, a hospital official said Wednesday. She was
52.
	   Nagao, who was born Yoriko Ebine, died in a Tokyo hospital on
Sunday. She was first diagnosed with cancer of the large intestine
in 1993, and the disease eventually spread to her lungs.
	   Nagao, a graduate of the Architectural Department from Musashino
Art University in 1968, set up her own architectural firm in 1984
with her husband Tetsuo.
	   She designed the ARK Hills complex of high-rise office
buildings, cultural facilities, a hotel and apartments in Tokyo's
Roppongi area. Designed with state-of-the-art technology, the
offices _ completed in 1986 _ are used 24 hours a day.
	   Other buildings Nagao designed include the 15-story Hotel Nikko
Tokyo, which opened near Tokyo Bay in 1996. Last year, she
published a book about her battle against cancer.

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Union leaders hinted strikers would
take more bold action Wednesday to cap the biggest labor protest in
the history of Puerto Rico.
	   Tens of thousands of protesters began a 48-hour general strike
against the sale of the state telephone company Tuesday by
dramatically blocking a main highway and its entry to San Juan's
international airport with hundreds of cars.
	   ``We will start our activities at 4 a.m.,'' promised Annie Cruz,
president of one of the two telephone workers' unions. She refused
to give details for ``strategic reasons.''
	   ``The fight doesn't end here. It's just beginning,'' Sen. Ruben
Berrios of the U.S. territory's Independence Party told a sea of
protesters Tuesday waving the island's single-star red, white and
blue flag.
	   In other incidents Tuesday, gunmen strafed a bank involved in
buying the telephone utility; protesters planted a bomb that was
harmlessly exploded by police outside a provincial branch of the
same bank; and saboteurs slashed telephone cables, leaving 260,000
people without long-distance service.
	   Union leaders have denied that their members are responsible for
sabotage and other acts of violence that routinely accompany labor
protests. Police have suggested that a clandestine pro-independence
guerrilla group might have been responsible for past bombings.
	   Opposition politicians and union leaders accuse Gov. Pedro
Rossello of ``selling off the national patrimony'' in a dlrs 1.9
billion deal to a consortium led by the U.S. giant GTE Corp. and
the local Banco Popular.
	   The governor's opponents say the privatization is part of his
campaign to make the Caribbean island the 51st U.S. state. Most
opponents want Puerto Rico to remain a U.S. commonwealth.
	   The government says state enterprises cannot compete in the new
deregulated markets and already has sold hotels and a shipping
company and transferred management of prisons and hospitals to
private companies.
	   Rossello wants to follow the telephone sale with those of other
utilities, which would further weaken the waning power of unions
that are strongest among the 300,000 government workers.
	   Pro-statehood groups in newspaper advertisements Tuesday
denounced the strike as a political bid to frighten away foreign
investment and signal that the Caribbean island is too unstable to
be admitted to the union.
	   Labor leaders said they hoped the strike would persuade the
government to hold a referendum of the telephone sale. But Rossello
told reporters the only referendum on the island would be one for
statehood that already has been approved by the U.S. House of
Representatives and awaits the decision of the Senate.
	   Telephone workers, who began an indefinite strike June 18, say
they fear for their jobs. Like many state enterprises, the company
is top-heavy with 6,400 workers controlled by 1,400 managers in
positions often created to reward political supporters.
	   Some 60 unions called the general strike to support the
telephone workers.
	   Tuesday's protests were largely peaceful with only a few
confrontations between police and strikers.
	   The telephone strike has cost Puerto Rico as much as dlrs 100
million, and the general strike could multiply that figure, said
Santos Negron, a leading economist and former member of the
government planning board.
	   Near the airport Tuesday, many tourists sweated in the tropical
heat as they dragged their luggage through the blockade of honking
cars.
	   ``Well, I'm never coming here again!'' Spanish tourist Felipe de
Andrea said as protesters helped him heft bags over the freeway
divider. Riot police carried them to a police van that took him and
others to the terminal.
	   LIAT Airlines canceled all flights, and at least two cruise
ships canceled port calls. Hotel owners said hundreds of tourists
have canceled vacations.
	   In the last general strike in Puerto Rico, tens of thousands of
sugar cane cutters stopped working in 1934 to demand better
conditions.

	   RALEIGH, North Carolina (AP) _ Former North Carolina basketball
player Makhtar Ndiaye has been convicted of assaulting a Chapel
Hill man after the two argued over the man's driving.
	   Ndiaye, a native of Senegal, was found guilty Tuesday in Wake
District Court on one misdemeanor count each of simple assault and
communicating threats.
	   Judge Paul Gessner gave Ndiaye a 30-day suspended sentence with
unsupervised probation and ordered him to pay dlrs 200 in fines and
court costs.
	   The judge also ordered him not to contact the victim, Daniel
Murdock, and to continue taking anger-management classes.
	   Ndiaye and his wife, Sony, were riding in a van from Chapel Hill
to Raleigh with Murdock and another friend to pick up the Ndiayes'
car from a dealership in May.
	   Murdock said he was driving on Interstate 40 when Ndiaye told
him to slow down and the two then started arguing. He said he tried
to talk with Ndiaye when they stopped at a barber shop, but the
basketball player grabbed him by the throat.
	   Murdock also said he heard Ndiaye tell their other friend, Ricky
Capps, ``I'm going to kill him when he gets back to Chapel Hill.''
	   Bill Blue, Ndiaye's lawyer, painted a different picture of what
happened that day. He told the judge that Ndiaye didn't use
profanity in the car and never touched Murdock.
	   Capps testified for the defense, saying he ``thought the
incident was blown out of proportion.''
	   Blue called several witnesses who said they didn't see Ndiaye
put his hands on Murdock.
	   Ndiaye took the stand in his own defense, telling the judge that
he said something about Murdock's driving, but did not use
profanity.
	   ``I thought he was swerving between cars and I didn't feel safe
so I told him to slow down,'' Ndiaye said.
	   However, he admitting making comments about Capps and Murdock.
	   ``I told Ricky, `You need to get your boy! If you don't want me
to kick your Capps' ass, you better get him out of here,'' Ndiaye
said.
	   Under questioning from assistant district attorney Russell
DeMent, Ndiaye denied making a statement during the NCAA
tournament's Final Four in San Antonio that generated nationwide
controversy. Ndiaye was quoted by reporters as saying a Utah player
had use a racial ephithet during a game.
	   Ndiaye later acknowledged making the accusation, admitted that
the Utah player had made no such slur and apologized.
	   But on the stand Tuesday, he denied making the accusation. When
reminded of the public apology he made through North Carolina's
sports information office, he said, ``That was a statement from the
school. I don't know what the school puts out for me.''
	   Ndiaye added, ``I don't feel that I have a problem with my
temper.''

Merrill Lynch opens first Tokyo branch of new retail brokerage

	   TOKYO (AP) _ U.S. securities company Merrill Lynch opened the
first Tokyo branch of its brokerage business in Japan on Wednesday,
its biggest step yet to cash in on the deregulation of the
country's financial markets.
	   Merrill Lynch Japan Securities Co., a unit of New York-based
Merrill Lynch and Co., plans to open 28 more branches around Japan
by the end of July and to eventually operate 33 here.
	   The company will offer mutual-fund-like accounts and brokerage
services to individual investors. Merrill Lynch opened its first
branch in Japan in Nagano, the site of the 1998 Winter Olympics, on
July 1.
	   Foreign financial companies are expanding rapidly in Japan amid
sweeping deregulation, known as the ``big bang,'' which is opening
financial markets to new competition.
	   Merrill Lynch executives said they are optimistic those reforms
will create a more vibrant economy.
	   The deregulation ``will advance the cause of an open,
transparent, liquid and well-regulated financial system, which is
essential to Japan's efforts to emerge from its current recession,
and resume healthy economic growth,'' Komansky said. ``Merrill
Lynch is bullish on Japan.''
	   Foreign companies are hoping to get a piece of Japan's dlrs 9
trillion pool of individual savings.
	   Merrill Lynch set up the retail brokerage unit in February,
hiring some 2,000 employees of failed Yamaichi Securities Co.,
Japan's fourth-largest brokerage. Yamaichi folded late last year
after revealing more than 250 billion yen ($1.8 billion) in hidden
losses.
