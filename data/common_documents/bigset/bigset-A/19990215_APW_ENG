<HEADLINE> France Finalizes Aerospace Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- The French finance ministry has finalized the  
details of a proposed merger between the government-controlled 
aerospace company Aerospatiale and Matra Hautes Technologies, a 
unit of privately-owned Lagardere. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministry, in an announcement late Monday, said that a  
planned 20 percent public offering in the merged group would take 
place in the first half of this year, market conditions permitting. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the merger deal, Lagardere will pay the government up to  
two billion francs (about $357 million) for a 33 percent stake in 
the Aerospatiale. The French government will own less than 50 
percent of the new company, but it will still be the largest 
shareholder. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the merger and decline in government ownership  
makes good commercial sense, and may boost the process of European 
defense sector restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are very complementary operations,'' said Antoine Nodet,  
analyst at the Paris brokerage Pinatton. ``The most obvious is in 
missiles, but they are a good match in other activities as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	European aerospace restructuring is expected to continue.  
</P>
<P>
	Germany's DaimlerChrysler Aerospace AG and France's Thomson-CSF  
are seen as the next likely movers after British Aerospace PLC's 
takeover earlier this year of General Electric PLC's Marconi 
division.

<HEADLINE> Announcer Jimmy Dudley Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- When Jimmy Dudley was working as an apprentice  
announcer on Chicago Cubs games, his lively, melodious voice caught 
the ear of a major sponsor of Cleveland Indians radio broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the man I want to do the Indians games,'' the chief of  
Erin Brew beer decided in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
	For the next 20 years, Dudley was the voice of the Cleveland  
Indians and greeted fans tuning in on the radio with ``Hello 
baseball fans everywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Dudley died at age 89 after a stroke said his wife,  
Angie. He suffered from Alzheimer's disease and spent the last two 
years in a special care home in Tucson, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	A gifted storyteller, Dudley was covered the Indians from 1948,  
the year the team won its last World Series, until 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	He often used the term, ``The string is out,'' when the count on  
a batter would come to three balls and two strikes. He would end 
his broadcast with ``Lots of good luck, ya heah,'' his Southern 
voice filled with friendliness. 
</P>
<P>
	In recognition of his work, Dudley was inducted into the  
broadcasters' wing of the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, 
N.Y., in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Dudley, a native of Alexandria, Va., majored in chemistry at the  
University of Virginia. He served as a pilot in the Army Air Corps 
during World War II and then turned to radio broadcasting after the 
war. 
</P>
<P>
	Dudley also did play-by-play for the Cleveland Browns in the  
1950s, for the Baltimore Colts and for Ohio State University 
football games. 
</P>
<P>
	He became the voice of the Seattle Pilots in 1969, but a year  
later, the team transferred to Milwaukee, leaving him behind. 
Dudley never announced a major league game again. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides his wife of 49 years, Dudley is survived by a son,  
Douglas, a Presbyterian minister in Carroll Stream, Ill., and a 
daughter, Barbara Wolf of Pittsburgh; two grandchildren; and a 
brother, Warren of Dallas, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Services will be in Tucson at a time to be announced.

<HEADLINE> American, Reno Pilots Don't Agree </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Capt. Tom Kachmar says he and his fellow American  
Airlines pilots are amazed that Reno Air pilots are angry at them. 
</P>
<P>
	Kachmar figures Reno pilots will be the big winners if his union  
succeeds in forcing a quicker integration of Reno's pilots into the 
American work force. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to be much better off working for American, pay  
and benefit-wise,'' Kachmar said of the Reno pilots. ``Pilots here 
are saying, 'Why are these guys upset when we're trying to raise 
their pay 50 percent?' '' 
</P>
<P>
	The Reno pilots are upset, one of their leaders said, because  
American's pilots want to place them last on American's seniority 
list. That affects where pilots are based and which assignments 
they get -- captain, first officer or just a flight engineer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll certainly not turn our nose up at the money,'' said  
Capt. Bob Collins from his home in Reno, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
	``But if they take away the seniority I've worked for ... I not  
only will be giving up my captain's seat, but I probably would be 
forced to go to the East Coast and be a flight engineer,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kachmar, a 15-year veteran with American who lives in  
Keller, Texas, near American's Fort Worth base, said his colleagues 
feel threatened by the arrival of the lower-paid Reno pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden, Reno Airlines is flying routes that American  
used to fly, while some of our pilots are still furloughed,'' 
Kachmar said. ``They're watching the flights they used to fly being 
flown by Reno Airlines, and they're extremely upset about it. These 
pilots aren't going to be happy if the Reno pilots are brought in 
senior to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pecking-order fight began in December, when American's  
parent company, AMR Corp., bought Reno, a low-cost carrier that 
serves mostly West Coast points. 
</P>
<P>
	American's pilots, members of the Allied Pilots Association,  
want all AMR pilots -- including those folded in from Reno Air -- 
immediately brought up to American's pay and benefits scale. But 
AMR wants to raise Reno pilots' pay only after they go through 
retraining to be part of the American team. 
</P>
<P>
	That led to the sickout by American pilots, which has caused  
more than 6,000 flights to be canceled over the past 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Kachmar hasn't flown in two weeks. He said he cut himself with a  
pocket knife while doing home repairs, requiring 12 stitches. 
</P>
<P>
	The American pilot said he and his colleagues are ``down to  
earth'' people who wouldn't dream of inconveniencing the flying 
public. He hopes any public resentment over the sickout is 
short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't expect any sympathy from the flying public,'' he  
said. ``We just ask that they be patient and understand that this 
is a very important issue to us -- job security.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Albert To Sign With Turner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Marv Albert will sign with Turner Sports, moving  
his return to broadcasting to the national level, The Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution said. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I can say is that we will be making a major talent  
announcement'' today, said Turner Sports vice president Gregg 
Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert returned to New York's Madison Square Garden Network last  
September as a weeknight anchor. His duties with Turner are 
expected to include the NBA, boxing, the Goodwill Games and the new 
pro football league that is in the planning stages with NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert's last national telecast was the NBA Finals in 1997 with  
NBC. Later that year he was fired by NBC and resigned from MSG 
Network after pleading guilty to biting a former lover during a 
sexual encounter. He has fulfilled the terms of his probation and 
his record has been cleared. 
</P>
<P>
	In his new deal with MSG, Albert was assigned to call a number  
of Knicks games on radio. His first game back was Feb. 8 in the 
Knicks' home opener against Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	His return to broadcasting was well-received in New York and  
Turner obviously expects a similar reaction from viewers 
nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Barkley Has Successful Knee Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Arthroscopic surgery on Charles Barkley's left  
knee was a success, but the Houston Rockets' leading rebounder 
won't return to action for at least three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The operation Sunday to repair a partially torn medial meniscus  
in the forward's left knee went as expected, said team physician 
Dr. Walter Lowe. 
</P>
<P>
	He removed between 10 and 15 percent of the cartilage, just as  
the MRI had indicated would be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were no surprises,'' said Lowe. ``It was a small  
cartilage tear, pretty much exactly how it looked on the MRI. That 
lets you take a deep breath and relax, not any bigger or worse than 
the pictures would have led us to believe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No additional damage was caused by Barkley's playing two games  
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley's knee was remarkably free of the damage that seemed  
probable for a 255-pound athlete in his 15th NBA season, Lowe said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen some of these knees and I thought we would see wear  
and tear with the type of player Charles is and what he weighs,'' 
he said. ``It was pristine from a wear-and-tear standpoint. The 
rest of his knee was completely normal. We don't have to worry 
about little degenerative areas, of wear and tear, holding up the 
rehab. So hopefully, he will be back pretty quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him he definitely has some good genes there,'' said  
Lowe. ``He just said, `I told you I was special.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley, 35, is the league's leading rebounder at 17.0 per game.  
He initially tried to play through his pain last week and treat the 
problem with rehabilitation and medication. 
</P>
<P>
	However, after discomfort continued and Barkley had trouble even  
bending his leg Saturday, he and the team chose surgery. Lowe and 
Dr. Bruce Moseley performed the surgery at Methodist Hospital in 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley had led the Rockets after recovering fully from  
off-season double hernia and elbow surgery. During Houston's 4-1 
start, Barkley averaged 19.2 points and collected at least 15 
rebounds in each game. 
</P>
<P>
	Backup Othella Harrington is expected to absorb most of  
Barkley's minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley's improved conditioning with the season's start will not  
be wasted but would help him return more quickly and effectively, 
said Lowe. The player was to begin rehabilitating his leg today. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants to return to the form he started this season in,''  
Lowe said. ``He and (personal trainer) Tim Grover were already 
planning a workout. He is intent on proving us wrong on how long it 
will take to come back. This is an injury that definitely could 
respond quickly. He is ready to do the work. I think we'll see him 
back in short order. 
</P>
<P>
	``He still has to recover from the surgery and this injury,''  
the physician said. ``But there is no question he can keep the 
conditioning level where it is. Him coming in in good condition is 
a huge plus here.''

<HEADLINE> Financial Services Deal Starts Mar. 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Nations representing more than 90 percent of the  
world's financial services market agreed Monday that a 
multitrillion-dollar global trade accord should start March 1. 
</P>
<P>
	A key panel of the World Trade Organization decided that the  
financial services agreement, which opens banking, insurance and 
securities markets to international competition, should take effect 
even though 18 countries still have to ratify it. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 52 governments have so far ratified the accord. The 18  
remaining countries have been given until the end of June to 
complete the work which will allow them to join in. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the major trading nations who have come into line are the  
United States, Japan and the countries of the European Union, 
except for Luxembourg which still has to ratify the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Trade officials welcomed the decision and said they were  
confident the other countries ``will come on board as quickly as 
their procedures allow them to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The officials, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity,  
said it is difficult to say how much trade is covered by the 
agreement. When the accord was agreed in December 1997, officials 
estimated there were $1.2 trillion worth of foreign-exchange deals 
done daily. They put total world banking assets at $20 trillion and 
insurance premiums at $2 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
	When the accord was agreed after 15 years of work it was greeted  
by supporters of the WTO as a major step forward in promoting 
worldwide free trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The financial sector worldwide has grown considerably in the  
past 30 years, with jobs in that area representing up to 5 percent 
of total world employment, according to WTO figures. 
</P>
<P>
	United States and European financial services companies  
particularly hope to benefit from freer access to the Asian market.

<HEADLINE> Reds Rescind Facial Hair Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Greg Vaughn can keep his goatee.  
</P>
<P>
	The Cincinnati Reds dropped one of their most distinctive and  
most widely questioned policies on Monday, allowing players to have 
facial hair for the 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Reds general manager Bob Howsam enacted the ban in 1967,  
insisting his team maintain a clean-shaven look during the decade 
of long hair. It became so ingrained in club history that only 
owner Marge Schott had the authority to reverse it. 
</P>
<P>
	She did so on Monday after talking to Vaughn, who lobbied hard  
to keep his goatee after he was traded to the Reds from San Diego 
on Feb. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``He reminded me that Schottzie (her dog) and I met him last  
year when he was in town,'' Schott said. ``I told him I wanted to 
see him hit 50 home runs again this year and create additional 
enthusiasm for our fans throughout the 1999 season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds had one of the most restrictive hair policies in the  
major leagues. The Arizona Diamondbacks also prohibit facial hair, 
but manager Buck Showalter has said that newcomer Randy Johnson can 
keep his mustache and long hair. Other teams limit what type of 
facial hair a player may have. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds' rule was so institutionalized that reliever Jim Kern  
managed to force a trade in 1982 by growing a beard. Reliever Jeff 
Reardon had to shave off his trademark beard when he became a Red 
in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	A player couldn't even be shown in the media guide with facial  
hair. When the Reds got Wayne Krenchicki from Baltimore at the 
start of spring training in 1982, they took an old photograph and 
whited out his moustache for his biography. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn lobbied for the team to drop the rule the day of the  
trade, saying his two children had never seen him without the 
goatee. Newspaper columnists took up his cause and fans flooded the 
club's offices with message of support. 
</P>
<P>
	``The old rule was very archaic,'' said general manager Jim  
Bowden, who has a clause in his contract that bars him from 
changing the hair policy. ``What spoke volumes was that the fans 
wanted us to remove the facial hair policy. They wrote letters, 
made phone calls, sent electronic mail, and it was overwhelming 
what the fans wanted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn issued a statement thanking Schott, then declined further  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't trying to rewrite any rules,'' Vaughn said. ``I'm  
just more comfortable with my facial hair. My main focus now is to 
get ready to help this team compete for a division title.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shaving mustaches and beards had become a spring ritual for  
numerous Reds players, who grew them over the winter and had to get 
rid of them before the first workout in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's any question this has been an issue over  
the years,'' Bowden said. ``I've been with the Reds since '89. Over 
the last 11 years, there have been numerous players that wanted to 
have facial hair. All of them were respectful and in the end, did 
what ownership wanted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although facial hair will be allowed, players will have to  
maintain a clean-cut image, Schott said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think the facial hair policy was that big of a deal  
anyway because I've always played clean-shaven,'' said shortstop 
Barry Larkin, who would sometimes grow facial hair in the 
offseason. ``I'm sure the organization is going to stress a 
wholesome image, and I know I wouldn't want to get away from that 
image.''

<HEADLINE> NYC Cop Faces Murder Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It was no surprise when Hessy Phelan died too  
young, a police officer's bullet in his head. 
</P>
<P>
	He had once belonged to a violent Irish Republican Army splinter  
group. Arrests for rioting and hijacking landed him in Northern 
Ireland's jails for most of a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	But Phelan, 39, did not die a martyr; he did not even die in his  
beloved homeland. Nine years after fleeing the ``Troubles,'' a 
drunken Hessy Phelan was killed by an off-duty New York City cop, 
authorities charge -- shot point-blank in the face, Jan. 21, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The cop tells a different tale: The 5-foot, 100-pound Irishman  
killed himself after a day-long drinking binge. Officer Richard 
Molloy says the tiny, drunken man snatched his gun and committed 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 22, three years after the bullet from his .38 caliber  
weapon killed Hessy Phelan, Molloy goes on trial for murder. He 
says he fears the verdict might be moot, believing the dead man's 
IRA pals plan their own justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelan's family and friends call Molloy a liar. The  
happy-go-lucky Phelan was not suicidal, they say, but planning a 
reunion with an old roommate. And it was no surprise, they charge, 
that Molloy wound up killing an innocent man. 
</P>
<P>
	Molloy, a second-generation cop assigned to the Bronx, amassed  
74 commendations and more than 400 arrests over an 11-year career. 
But there were allegations of brutality and two lawsuits against 
him, including a pending $18 million assault case. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd been hearing about Molloy in the neighborhood,'' recalls  
Graham Friel, co-owner of the Oak Bar in Bainbridge, a heavily 
Irish enclave in the Bronx, where Phelan downed his last drink. ``A 
lot more came to light after the (Phelan) shooting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The elfin Phelan was ``very much a local character,'' says New  
York attorney Martin Galvin, a veteran supporter of republican 
causes. ``He was involved in supporting political prisoners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No surprise there: Phelan was once among their ranks.  
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Heslin Phelan grew up one of five children in  
Londonderry, a militant IRA outpost and the site of 1972's ``Bloody 
Sunday'' massacre. Like many other locals, he embraced the 
often-violent cause of Irish nationalism, joining the Irish 
National Liberation Army. 
</P>
<P>
	A botched car-jacking in 1977 nearly killed him; Phelan dodged  
bullets as a cohort died on a Londonderry street. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next 10 years, Phelan was in and out of British jails,  
once attempting escape by squeezing his diminutive frame inside a 
prison pool table. He grew tight with the IRA brethren during their 
time behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
	Released in 1987, Phelan moved to the United States and lived  
with his sister in Connecticut before relocating to the Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was here one week and he said, `I'm not going back to  
'Derry,''' recalls his sister, Martina Boback, her voice choked 
with emotion. ``There was no way he was getting involved with the 
`Troubles' again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phelan took a job as a house painter and started anew. ``He  
didn't talk much about the past,'' says his roommate of five years, 
Brian Brolly. ``He just got on with his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phelan's supporters don't paint him as a saint; he liked his  
liquor a bit too much, and a few drinks turned his tongue sharp. 
But they can't imagine what words could have caused his death that 
night at the Oak Bar. 
</P>
<P>
	Molloy's girlfriend, barmaid Maggie McGrath, had grown tired of  
Phelan's drunken prattle. She asked Molloy to toss Phelan out, and 
the cop steered him into McGrath's nearby apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	The three had a history: McGrath had previously dated a Phelan  
pal named Barney Logue, taking up with Molloy after Logue's death. 
Phelan did not look kindly on her new relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Molloy, the drunken Phelan began throwing up in  
McGrath's apartment -- and yet, at some point, was still able to 
steal the cop's gun. Phelan jammed the weapon against his left eye 
and fired, Molloy said, telling investigators that it was a 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	But the medical examiner determined the bullet's angle made the  
officer's version improbable. A different scenario now surfaced: 
Phelan taunting Molloy until the infuriated cop, bent on shutting 
him up, fired a single gunshot. 
</P>
<P>
	The new story gained believers after a third man in the  
apartment, Cormac Lee, spoke with authorities. Lee said he walked 
in from the kitchen to see Phelan dying and Molloy's hand returning 
from the back of his pants. 
</P>
<P>
	It appeared, Lee said, that Molloy had just returned his weapon  
to his waistband. ``You saw nothing,'' Molloy allegedly announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney George Vallario dismisses the autopsy and Lee's  
tale, claiming the prosecution is being driven by pressure from 
Phelan's family and the local Irish community. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is Richie's reason for killing this guy?'' Vallario asks.  
``He had nothing against this guy. Hessy Phelan was just a poor 
soul.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others disagree.  
</P>
<P>
	``You think a little drunken man can take a gun off a big sober  
cop?'' bar-owner Friel asks. ``That's what swayed me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The evidence that could have quickly cleared Molloy was botched  
by police: Phelan's hands were never bagged and checked for 
gunpowder residue, Vallario says. 
</P>
<P>
	And the lawyer insists stories of Phelan's good spirits are  
exaggerated. Phelan was depressed by the recent deaths of his 
father, uncle and best friend and was resigned to a life away from 
Ireland, the lawyer says. He was drinking heavily. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, Phelan's death caused many involved to revisit the  
``Troubles'' that he'd so eagerly left behind. The initial suicide 
ruling, coupled with a nine-month delay in the indictment, conjured 
up parallels to British injustices. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are cases where people get shot by British troopers and  
some sort of whitewash goes on,'' Galvin explained. ``For the 
family and for the Irish community here, that was deeply felt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary hearings were held in a courtroom divided; the  
hatred inside was palpable, Vallario says. Phelan's mother twice 
made the trip from Ireland, and other friends and relatives stared 
down Molloy and his backers. 
</P>
<P>
	Vallario insists the IRA threats are real, that Molloy has  
already been the target of vandalism and hang-up phone calls. 
Married to Maggie McGrath last year, Molloy now has more to lose: 
the couple had a son in January. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's our biggest fear,'' the lawyer said. ``These are not  
playboys. These guys mean business.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> ChiSox, Durham Agree to $20M Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Second baseman Ray Durham avoided a salary  
arbitration hearing Monday, agreeing to a $20 million, four-year 
contract with the Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	Durham, selected to the All-Star team last season, made  
$1,935,000 last year. He had asked for $4.3 million in arbitration 
and the White Sox had submitted $3.35 million. The arbitration 
hearing had been scheduled Monday in Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Durham, 27, hit .285 with 19 homers, 67 RBIs and 36 steals last  
season, all career highs. He was second in the AL with 126 runs 
scored and his 19 homers were a club record for a second baseman. 
</P>
<P>
	Durham, entering his fifth major league season, has a .273  
career average with 47 homers, 236 RBIs and 117 steals. 
</P>
<P>
	He will receive salaries of $3.4 million this season, $4.9  
million in 2000, $5.9 million in 2001 and $5.8 million in 2002. If 
he has 625 plate appearances in 2001, his 2002 salary would 
increase to $6.3 million. If he has fewer than 625 plate 
appearances in 2001, he could earn a $500,000 bonus for 625 plate 
appearances in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal calls for Durham to receive $100,000 of his 2000 salary  
this year as an advance. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago failed to re-sign free agents Albert Belle and Robin  
Ventura and will be counting on Durham and Frank Thomas for run 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are committed to our young talent and are happy Ray will be  
a key part of this club's long-term foundation,'' White Sox general 
manager Ron Schueler said.

<HEADLINE> Rams Sign Free Agent QB Trent Green </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The St. Louis Rams signed free agent  
quarterback Trent Green to a four-year, $16.5 million contract 
Monday, spelling the end of the Tony Banks era. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dick Vermeil made it clear at a news conference that Green  
was being brought in as the starter. The Rams have made a 
qualifying offer to Banks, a restricted free agent, and likely will 
sign him and trade him. 
</P>
<P>
	After the season, Vermeil said he wanted another quarterback to  
compete with Banks, the starter the last 3 1/2 seasons. He was forced 
to change his mind once he surveyed the potential backup candidates 
and the likely cost. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams were attempting to notify Banks, who is on a Caribbean  
cruise, and give him the news that it's all but a certainty that he 
won't be back next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all do what we have to do,'' Vermeil said. ``I don't mind  
listening to the top people I have around me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe Tony Banks will be a starting quarterback and a very  
successful playoff quarterback,'' Vermeil said. ``It just doesn't 
look like it'll end up being here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vermeil said that Kurt Warner, the third-stringer last season  
and one of the five players exposed for the Cleveland Browns' 
expansion draft, is the backup. 
</P>
<P>
	The assurance that Green would be handed the job closed the deal  
for the Rams, who won a bidding war to lure him away from the 
Washington Redskins. It also helped that the Rams' offensive 
coordinator, Mike Martz, was the Redskins' quarterbacks coach the 
last two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to know where I stood and he made it very clear to  
me,'' Green said. ``If there were opportunities out there to be the 
starter and not worry about competition, obviously that brings 
something to the table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Green signing came a day after the Rams, who promised to be  
active in the free agency period that began Friday, signed 
offensive guard Adam Timmerman to a five-year, $18.7 million 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Green, 29, started the 1998 season as an unheralded  
third-stringer for Washington, but ended up starting 14 games, 
completing 278 of 509 passes for 3,441 yards and 23 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Redskins struggled in the first half of the season, but went  
6-3 over the final nine weeks to finish 7-9. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis had been interested in Rich Gannon, the former Kansas  
City Chiefs quarterback who signed with the Oakland Raiders on 
Monday. Former Raiders quarterback Jeff George had also been 
scheduled to visit Rams Park on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams may not be done shopping just yet. Atlanta safety Devin  
Bush was in for a visit Monday and others scheduled are Cincinnati 
safety Sam Shade and Pittsburgh wide receiver Charles Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good place to play,'' Bush said. ``They're going to be  
headed for good things. They're really committed to turning this 
thing around.''

<HEADLINE> Vikings Trade Johnson to Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Quarterback Brad Johnson's career with the  
Minnesota Vikings ended Monday when they traded him to the 
Washington Redskins for a package of draft picks. 
</P>
<P>
	Officially choosing Randall Cunningham as the leader of their  
high-powered offense, the Vikings sent their one-time starter to 
the Redskins for first- and third-round draft picks this year and a 
second-round pick in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got a lot of valuable coupons today, and how we redeem  
those coupons will tell the story,'' Vikings general manager Tim 
Connolly said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's agent, Phil Williams, said his client had mixed  
feelings about the move. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always bittersweet when you've had such a good  
situation,'' Williams said. ``He's loved Minnesota, but when things 
happen the way they did he realized that the situation pretty much 
was going to predicate him leaving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Washington made the deal after their starting quarterback, Trent  
Green, signed with St. Louis as a free agent Monday. The Redskins 
will give up the second of their two first-round picks, 11th 
overall. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made a decision not to re-sign Trent because we were going  
to trade for Brad Johnson,'' said Charley Casserly, Washington's 
general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson is scheduled to take a physical with the Redskins on  
Tuesday morning to complete the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings had talked with at least six teams about a possible  
trade. They had been negotiating with the Redskins for nearly a 
month and said the third-round pick this year was an important part 
of the deal. The Vikings gave up their 1999 third-rounder last year 
in a trade for cornerback Jimmy Hitchcock. 
</P>
<P>
	``We set the price and the Washington Redskins met it,''  
Connolly said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was an afterthought when the Vikings took him in the  
ninth round of the 1992 draft. Johnson hadn't even been a starter 
during his senior season at Florida State, and the Vikings didn't 
activate him for a game until 1994, his third season. 
</P>
<P>
	But they never gave up on his potential, either. Johnson earned  
the No. 2 job behind Warren Moon in 1994, then spent another season 
behind Moon before finally getting his chance in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	When Moon was hurt during the season opener, Johnson came on to  
throw the winning touchdown pass late in the fourth quarter against 
Detroit. He started his first game at Atlanta the following week, 
throwing for 275 yards and two touchdowns to earn NFC Offensive 
Player of the Week honors. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson took over the starting job for good in November that  
season, and earned a $15.5 million contract extension a month 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	However, injuries have defined Johnson's career since then.  
</P>
<P>
	He was among the NFL's top quarterbacks in 1997 until a neck  
injury cost him the final five games. Johnson was back as the 
starter when the 1998 season began, but he broke a bone in his 
right leg at St. Louis in Week 2 and gave way to Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham went on to an All-Pro season, leading the Vikings to  
a 15-1 regular season record and the most points in NFL history 
before their upset loss to Atlanta in the NFC championship game. 
Johnson returned for one game during the season, when Cunningham 
hurt his knee early against New Orleans on Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	But Johnson broke the thumb on his passing hand that day, and  
although he played the entire second half with the injury he once 
again was out of a starting job. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Vikings rewarded Cunningham with a $28 million contract  
extension in December, it also became clear that Johnson probably 
would be moving on. He issued a play-me-or-trade me edict the day 
after the loss to the Falcons, and the Vikings honored his request 
Monday after talking with several other teams, most prominently the 
Baltimore Ravens.

<HEADLINE> Women's Hoop Poll Top 3 Remain Same </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Tennessee, Purdue and Louisiana Tech remained the top three  
teams today in The Associated Press women's basketball poll, which 
underwent considerable shuffling through the rest of the list. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven teams from the Top 25 lost during the past week, but  
seven were beaten by other ranked teams and no one dropped from the 
poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee received 40 of 41 first-place votes to hold the No. 1  
spot for the sixth consecutive week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lady Vols (23-1) had 1,024 points from a national media  
panel after surviving a tough game with Auburn. Tennessee overcame 
33 percent shooting in the second half to beat the Tigers 71-63 at 
Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue (23-1), which had 981 points, also had a close call,  
beating Penn State 76-74 in overtime on the road before routing 
Ohio State at home. Louisiana Tech (20-2) beat a Top 25 team, 
Florida International, on the road and received 947 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado State (26-1) moved up one spot to fourth and was  
followed by Old Dominion, Connecticut, Rutgers, Duke, Notre Dame 
and Virginia Tech, which made the Top 10 for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Old Dominion jumped three places to its highest ranking of the  
season after beating Connecticut, which dropped two spots. Rutgers 
climbed two places following a victory over Notre Dame, which went 
from sixth to ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 7 ranking was the highest for Rutgers since it was sixth  
the week of Jan. 14, 1991. Duke fell one spot to eighth after its 
first Atlantic Coast Conference loss, 80-75 at Clemson. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Tech climbed two places to 11th, North Carolina was 12th,  
UCLA 13th and Clemson and Georgia were tied for 14th. Georgia fell 
four places after losing to unranked Vanderbilt. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State was 16th, followed by Virginia, Oregon, Iowa State  
and UC Santa Barbara. Kansas, Auburn, Florida International, LSU 
and Alabama held the five final spots. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn also lost to Alabama last week and fell five places for  
the biggest drop in the poll. Clemson's move from 19th to 14th and 
Oregon's from 23rd to 18th were the biggest jumps. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemson beat Georgia Tech by 28 before knocking off Duke, while  
Oregon defeated Washington State and Washington to pull into a 
first-place tie with UCLA in the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
	A loss at unranked Kansas State sent Iowa State from 16th to  
19th. The Cyclones rebounded to make a school-record 16 3-pointers 
in a victory over Colorado at home. 
</P>
<P>
	LSU beat Texas-Pan American and South Carolina, but a 25-point  
loss to unranked Arkansas dropped the Lady Tigers from 20th to 
23rd.

<HEADLINE> Daytona 500 Ratings Up 3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Once again, the Daytona 500 proved it is the  
biggest auto race on television. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Gordon's victory on Sunday had a 7.9 overnight rating and a  
20 share, up 3 percent from last year's overnight rating of 7.7/19. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's mark tied it with the 1992 and 1994 races, which  
also received a 7.9 overnight rating. 
</P>
<P>
	The Daytona 500 has outrated the Indy 500 for three straight  
years. The last three Indy 500s have averaged a 5.7 national mark' 
Daytona's national number won't be available until Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The auto race wasn't CBS' only winner this weekend.  
</P>
<P>
	The final round of the Buick Invitational, won by Tiger Woods,  
had a 6.4 overnight rating, up 64 percent from last season's 
tournament on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	The rating is the percentage of TV households in the nation  
tuned to a program, and each point represents 994,000 homes. The 
share is the percentage tuned to a program among those televisions 
on at the time.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines Has Record Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Philippine Airlines reported a record  
loss for the first nine months of its fiscal year and said it plans 
to sell its maintenance and engineering operations to pay off 
creditors and avoid closure. 
</P>
<P>
	PAL reported a net loss Monday of 9.98 billion pesos ($260  
million) in the first nine months of the fiscal year, which ends in 
March, more than double its $124 million loss in the same period a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline blamed the worsening loss on a sharp cutback on  
flight operations, higher financing charges and its temporary 
closure last September because of a labor dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the airline's workers, PAL chief adviser Peter  
Foster said the company is discussing possible layoffs with union 
leaders if the sale of its maintenance and engineering operations 
goes through. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster did not say how much PAL is seeking for its engineering  
division or how many workers would be affected, but another PAL 
official, who asked not to be named, said as many as 1,000 of the 
company's 8,000 workers could be laid off. 
</P>
<P>
	PAL recently averted having most of its jet fleet seized by U.S.  
and European creditors by making an initial payment on debts 
totaling $2.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	A new management also has completed a draft of a revised  
rehabilitation plan, which company officials planned to present to 
U.S. and European creditors in Washington. Further presentations 
are scheduled in Paris on Feb. 22 and in Hong Kong on March 1.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Talks of Self Renewal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For President Clinton, this appears a time of  
self-renewal and forward focus as he claims the world stage -- and 
New Hampshire's familiar political terrain -- with talk of a ``new 
season'' and ``this tide of spring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president's words as he sat opposite Mexican President  
Ernesto Zedillo on Monday were not new. The aftermath of his 
impeachment and acquittal should, for the nation, be a ``time for 
reconciliation and renewal,'' Clinton reiterated during his quick 
trip to Merida, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	But his brimming confidence this time suggested he feels he's  
won not only a second chance but a stronger hand. 
</P>
<P>
	From commanding the world stage on his 23-hour mission to  
Mexico, Clinton takes the policy helm of his Democratic Party on 
Wednesday, with a Social Security forum at the White House -- the 
centerpiece of a day when Democrats fan out to Social Security town 
meetings nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday, he welcomes French President Jacques Chirac at the White  
House and is planning his first news conference since last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	In between, Clinton will spend all of Thursday making stops  
around New Hampshire, where in the 1992 campaign he coined his own 
nickname as ``The Comeback Kid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I never saw him act like a man in trouble in the first  
place,'' Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said Monday evening as he 
boarded Air Force One behind Clinton en route home from Mexico. 
``But he sure had a great day today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands and thousands of Mexicans, many setting up  
mariachi-style bands on the sidewalk, lined the streets of Merida 
to cheer Clinton's motorcade with flags and banners wishing him and 
``su esposa (your wife) Hillary'' happy returns. 
</P>
<P>
	``This joy, this warmth, this affection is reserved only for our  
dearest friends,'' Zedillo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton basked in that affection.  
</P>
<P>
	He thanked the congressional delegation with him -- including  
Republican Reps. Mark Sanford of South Carolina, Rob Portman of 
Ohio and Kevin Brady of Texas, each of whom voted in favor of 
Clinton's impeachment -- for their show of ``America's commitment 
for the common future we will make together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To officials from both Mexico and the United States, Clinton  
proclaimed: ``This tide of spring has brought a new season of 
friendship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was talking about U.S.-Mexico relations, but the sentiment  
appeared to apply more broadly. 
</P>
<P>
	On the return flight to Washington late Monday, Clinton lingered  
with members of Congress in the guest cabin. While the president 
signed pages of Air Force One stationery for one guest, others 
showed off to Clinton the T-shirts and other Mexican souvenirs 
they'd picked up. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewards passed out Hemp Golden beer, whose label boasted the  
``smooth, mild, mellow herbal flavor'' of having been brewed with 
hemp seeds. 
</P>
<P>
	In a comfortable exchange Monday with the same reporters he  
dodged for most of last year, Clinton mused from his seat at the 
lavish Hacienda Temozon (Whirlwind Estate) about his wife's 
political future and his own. 
</P>
<P>
	``She and I both would like to continue to be useful in public  
affairs when we leave office,'' he said in between private meetings 
with Zedillo. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the prospect that Mrs. Clinton would be a shoo-in to  
replace New York Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, ``I think 
she would be terrific in the Senate,'' the president said.

<HEADLINE> Skier Kjus Earns Record Fifth Medal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- Many casual followers of the World Cup ski  
circuit don't know how to pronounce his name, but they're learning 
fast. Lasse Kjus just can't be ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus -- it's pronounced ``choos'' as in schuss, the German word  
for ``ski down a mountain fast'' -- made history in the World Alpine 
Ski Championships, which concluded with the men's slalom on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The unflappable Norwegian captured an unprecedented fifth medal  
in these championships, finishing runner-up in the slalom behind 
surprise winner Kalle Palander of Finland. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus, who became the fourth skier in history to win four medals  
in a world championship when he captured the giant slalom on 
Friday, set the record with the best slalom finish of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Going a perfect 5-for-5, he also won gold in super-G and claimed  
silver in downhill and combined. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lasse is incredible,'' said bronze medalist Christian Mayer of  
Austria. ``Five medals in five starts -- what more can you say?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toni Sailer (1956), Jean-Claude Killy (1968) and Pirmin  
Zurbriggen (1987) all won four medals in a single championship. 
Only Kjus owns five. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus, 28, tied teammate Kjetil Andre Aamodt and Luxembourg's  
Marc Girardelli for the most medals won in both world championships 
and Olympics -- 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how it felt to win five medals, Kjus said with a wide  
grin: ``It's a fantastic feeling. I can't believe it. It's 
incredible what has happened. I'm on a roll now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus insisted he was ``very happy'' with his second-place  
finish. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the second run, it was very chattery in the steep section  
and I didn't dare to give my all,'' he said. ``It was so close 
after the first run that I knew I could easily have ended up in 
fourth or fifth place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus led the first run of slalom, holding a slim margin of .19  
seconds over Mayer. Italy's Giorgio Rocca was third, .41 seconds 
off the pace. The unheralded Palander stood seventh, .78 seconds 
behind Kjus. 
</P>
<P>
	Palander, starting in the first seed of slalom for the first  
time after matching his previous career best with a sixth-place 
finish last month in Kitzbuhel, Austria, had the fastest second 
run. 
</P>
<P>
	His time of 49.92 seconds gave him a combined time of 1 minute,  
42.12 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Six subsequent racers couldn't dislodge him from the lead.  
</P>
<P>
	Kjus was .76 seconds faster than Palander through the  
intermediate clocking but lost time on the bottom of the steep, icy 
course, and his 50.81 second run -- only the eighth-fastest -- 
dropped him to second place at 1:42.23. 
</P>
<P>
	When Kjus' time was flashed on the scoreboard, a disbelieving  
Palander, 21, danced in the finish area, punching the air with his 
skis. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first Alpine medal ever for Finland, a country more  
noted for its Nordic skiing.

	``I stood in the start for a minute and got myself together,''  
Palander said. ``When I came down, I thought, `OK, maybe a medal.' 
It must have been the last part where I made up all the time. I was 
hoping for top five. But a gold medal, unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayer held on for the bronze in 1:42.25.  
</P>
<P>
	Rocca was fourth in 1:42.33, followed by Austrian rookie  
Benjamin Raich in 1:42.55. 
</P>
<P>
	Austria's Thomas Stangassinger, who leads the World Cup slalom  
standings this season, charged from 12th place after the first run 
to finish sixth in 1:42.82. Aamodt rallied from 15th to finish 
seventh in 1:42.91. 
</P>
<P>
	Bode Miller of Franconia, N.H., 30th out of the start house,  
stood 13th after the first run and wound up eighth in 1:42.94. 
</P>
<P>
	Switzerland's Paul Accola was ninth in 1:43.24, and Slovenia's  
Jure Kosir slipped from fourth to 10th in 1:43.28. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley Hayer was the top Canadian, placing 16th in 1:45.08.  
Sacha Gros of Vail, Colo., was 19th in 1:45.60. 
</P>
<P>
	In the final accounting, Austria led the way with 13 medals and  
Norway had nine. 
</P>
<P>
	The championships were a major disappointment for the German  
team. 
</P>
<P>
	The German women, in particular, were expected to win several  
medals because Hilde Gerg and Martina Ertl have been among the 
world's best skiers, ranking second and third, respectively, in the 
World Cup overall standings heading into the championships. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gerg's fourth-place finish in the combined was the best by  
any German. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States had only slim hopes for medaling in these  
championships, and failed to meet even those modest expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Kristina Koznick of Burnsville, Minn., was among the favorites  
in the women's slalom, but she missed a gate only seconds into the 
first run of the event. 
</P>
<P>
	Hometown favorite Chad Fleischer had the best U.S. result --  
sixth in the men's super-G.

<HEADLINE> Threat of Avalanches Delays Search </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELLINGHAM, Wash. (AP) -- Avalanche danger Monday kept search  
parties from looking for a young man who vanished in an earlier 
slide that took the life of a snowboarder. 
</P>
<P>
	The mile-long avalanche buried a stretch of Mount Baker in snow  
and debris up to 20 feet deep. The body of snowboarder Justin M. 
Parker, 19, was recovered Sunday, but then search efforts were 
suspended because of the extreme avalanche danger. 
</P>
<P>
	Sean Riches, 25, believed to be a skier, was still missing.  
</P>
<P>
	Signs and a rope line warn those venturing into the Rumble Gully  
area, just outside the Mount Baker Ski Area, about 90 miles 
northeast of Seattle. But no avalanche-control work is allowed or 
done in the area, ski area spokeswoman Gwyn Howat said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The sign informs hikers, snowboarders and skiers that there will  
be a $500 minimum fine for any rescue effort, and notes that such 
efforts may not be possible. 
</P>
<P>
	The slide was estimated to be moving ``close to 200 miles per  
hour,'' and took seconds to bury the entire slope, Howat said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 feet of snow had fallen in the area over the past 12  
days, so going outside the maintained ski area was like ``playing 
Russian roulette,'' Whatcom County Deputy Ron Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Freymeyer, operations leader for Bellingham Mountain  
Rescue, said the avalanche was the largest he had seen on the 
10,778-foot peak. 
</P>
<P>
	More snow is expected in the next few days -- topping off 690  
inches of snowfall so far this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Still missing in Rumble Gully is Jason Edward Carey Fuller, 25,  
of Bellingham, a snowboarder who vanished in a mid-January 
avalanche.

<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- The Rolling Stones got a grand welcome  
from their former bodyguard, who happens to be the new governor of 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's done us proud, hasn't he?'' a chuckling Mick Jagger said  
of Gov. Jesse Ventura. ``He's been fantastic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jagger also liked Ventura's proclamation which declared Monday  
as Rolling Stones Day in Minnesota -- even Ventura's congratulations 
to 55-year-old Keith Richards for being ``still alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's done it very funny and been very lighthearted about the  
whole thing but it's obviously very nice for us,'' Jagger said.. 
</P>
<P>
	He was asked whether the governor might be invited to sing.  
</P>
<P>
	Jagger laughed and said, ``I hope he doesn't want to wrestle,  
that's all.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> American Resumes Talks With Pilots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Operations at American Airlines are expected to be  
almost normal Tuesday, a sharp contrast to the past 10 days during 
which more than 6,000 flights were canceled due to a pilot sickout. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fort Worth-based airline has canceled only 17 flights  
scheduled for Tuesday, spokesman John Hotard said. 
</P>
<P>
	American's parent company, AMR Corp., and the Allied Pilots  
Association have begun negotiating again over the integration of 
the recently purchased Reno Air. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks broke down earlier this month over a dispute over how the  
Reno pilots were being paid caused pilots to start calling in sick 
and refusing to work overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	At its high point last Thursday and Friday, nearly 2,500 of  
American's 9,400 pilots were on a sick list, forcing American to 
cancel more than half of its 2,250 scheduled flights each day. 
</P>
<P>
	According to American, pilots have been taking themselves off  
the sick list at a rapid rate since Saturday after a federal judge 
ruled held the union and two top board members in contempt and 
promised sizable fines against them. 
</P>
<P>
	About 250 -- or roughly 11 percent -- of the 2,250 flights  
scheduled were canceled Monday because some pilots weren't 
immediately available for flying. 
</P>
<P>
	Hotard compared the impact on the airline's flight system to bad  
weather over the airline's Chicago, Miami or Dallas-Fort Worth 
hubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Some pilots complained that the number of pilots on the sick  
list could have been inflated because they had been trying to 
remove themselves, but normal procedures were suspended. Instead, 
they were told they had to meet with their chief medical officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Hotard said that was true for only 12 or 13 pilots who face  
possible disciplinary action for flying as passengers while they 
were on the sick list. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall threatened a ``significant''  
fine against the pilots' union Saturday, saying that the union did 
not do enough to encourage pilots to return to work after he 
ordered the union to end the sickout last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge required the union place $10 million, or one-quarter  
of the union's net worth, with the court in preparation of making 
his final decision this Wednesday. He also ordered union president 
Rich LaVoy and vice president Brian Mayhew to remit a total of 
$15,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 6,000 flights have been canceled since the work action  
began, costing American between $67 million and $90 million, 
according to Chris Chiames, a spokesman for AMR Corp. The final 
total has not been projected. 
</P>
<P>
	American also will see revenue reductions in the future. The  
airline said it will reduce its schedule 2 percent in the spring, 
or about 45-50 flights a day, because it does not believe pilots 
will volunteer for extra overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute is over how Reno Air pilots have been paid since AMR  
took control of the low-cost carrier last December. AMR wants to 
pay the pilots higher rates as they are retrained, but the union 
believes their contract guarantees the pilots are paid more from 
the purchase date. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Reno pilots' pay is half the $164,000 a year that an  
experienced American pilot is paid. AMR said the pilot union's 
demands to add Reno pilots to the higher pay scale quickly would 
cost as much as $50 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides said the sickout had not changed their original  
negotiating positions. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, neither the company or union has requested a federal  
mediator or binding arbitration in the dispute.

<HEADLINE> 3 Firefighters Die in Texas Blaze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE WORTH, Texas (AP) -- A wind-whipped fire destroyed a church  
Monday, killing three firefighters who were trapped when the roof 
collapsed and injuring three others. 
</P>
<P>
	The three were apparently trapped in rubble after the collapse,  
fire officials said. Investigators believe the fire was 
deliberately set. 
</P>
<P>
	``At one point, it was billowing smoke, everything was covered --  
the whole sky, and the flames kept moving toward the front of the 
building. The wind has been ferocious like this forever,'' said 
witness Kevin Schreiber, who works across the street from the 
church. ``The roof all of the sudden just buckled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Kent Worley of the Fort Worth Fire Department said the fire  
started in the back of the Precious Faith Temple and spread to the 
attic. The cause of the fire was being investigated. 
</P>
<P>
	Crews attacked areas of rubble where the missing firefighters  
were believed to be and finally reached the bodies more than two 
hours after the collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though we are firefighters, we have to go on doing our  
business as best we can,'' Worley said. ``We're all human. ... It's 
not going to be an easy process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the victims, Brian Collins, 35, and Phillip Dean, 29,  
were Fort Worth firemen who were volunteering for a suburban fire 
department on their day off. The third victim, 19-year-old Gary 
Sanders, was a fireman from nearby Sansom Park. 
</P>
<P>
	The three firefighters who were injured had been on the roof.  
One was hospitalized in serious condition; the other two were in 
good or stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of firefighters from Lake Worth and nearby fire  
departments were called to the scene. Police blocked off streets 
around the church, and helicopters hovered overhead. 
</P>
<P>
	Lake Worth is a suburb of Fort Worth.

<HEADLINE> Fleisher Now a Force on Senior Tour  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *Two in a row on the Senior Tour, Fleisher's first    	
</P>
<P>
	SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) -- Move over Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus,  
Gary Player and George Archer. Bruce Fleisher has arrived on the 
Senior Tour in a big way. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, Nicklaus, Player and Archer each won the first event  
they played upon entering the PGA's 50-and-over circuit. Fleisher 
joined them just last week by winning in Key Biscayne, Fla., in his 
Senior Tour debut, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday, though, Fleisher went that hallowed company one better.  
</P>
<P>
	He became the first player to win his first two events on the  
Senior PGA Tour when he captured the American Express Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleisher performed the feat by shooting a final round  
3-under-par 69, finishing with a three-shot lead over Larry Nelson, 
who closed with a 67. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had no expectations of this,'' a gleeful Fleisher gushed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, I tried to prepare for this. But very few guys -- I'm  
thinking Hale Irwin or Jack Nicklaus -- really believe how good they 
are and can look in the mirror and know they can win. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a journeyman and made a living. This is really  
special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just how special?  
</P>
<P>
	Well, Fleisher earned $180,000, the largest check of his pro  
career. That boosted his senior winnings to $330,000. 
</P>
<P>
	All that after just one single victory in more than 400 PGA Tour  
starts over 29 years. His total earnings for all those years on the 
regular circuit? Just $1,695,111. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Fleisher easily protected the three-shot lead he  
carried into the final round, touring the Tournament Players Club 
at Prestancia with a four-birdie, one-bogey round, finishing the 
54-hole event with a 13-under total of 203. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleisher never looked back after hitting a 7-iron to 5 feet for  
a birdie at the 416-yard, par-4 third hole. 
</P>
<P>
	``That sort of got me kick-started,'' he said. ``I had a cushion  
of three or four shots most of the day. Actually, I felt pretty 
good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His sole bogey of the day came on the 17th hole, by which time  
he had built a four-shot lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Third was Walter Hall, who had a 66 on Sunday, finishing at 207.  
Tom Wargo had a 72-209 to finish fourth.

	U.S. Warns Iraq on Threat  
</P>
<P>
	MERIDA, Mexico (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said  
today the U.S. ``response would be swift and sure'' if Iraq 
attacked the Turkish base American planes are using to patrol Iraqi 
skies. Albright is with President Clinton on his trip to Mexico. 
Iraqi vice president Taha Yassin Ramadan had said Iraq will attack 
the Incirlik base if American jets keep patrollng over Iraq. U.S. 
warplanes today fired on Iraqi defense sites in northern Iraq, the 
Defense Department said in Washington. It said the planes returned 
safely to Incirlik. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton At Mexico Summit  
</P>
<P>
	MERIDA, Mexico (AP) -- President Clinton offered a strong hint  
today that he will certify Mexico as a reliable ally in the 
struggle against drugs, saying cooperation ``has clearly improved'' 
under President Ernesto Zedillo. Despite Mexico's disappointing 
record on extraditions and a drop last year in cocaine and heroin 
seizures, Clinton found positive things to say about Mexico's 
efforts. He welcomed a plan announced two weeks ago to invest up to 
$500 million in a new anti-drug initiative and declared, ``The 
United States is ready to do all we can to support you.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Optimistic on Presidency  
</P>
<P>
	MERIDA, Mexico (AP) -- President Clinton today said ``everything  
will be fine'' in post-impeachment politics if Republicans and 
Democrats put aside bitter differences. Clinton spoke with 
reporters at talks with Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo. He also 
fueled speculation that his wife, Hillary, might run for a U.S. 
Senate seat from New York. ``She would be terrific,'' Clinton said. 
He quickly added that she has not made a decision and that he would 
enthusiastically support whatever she does.

	Ex-Nixon Aide Ehrlichman Dies  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- John Ehrlichman, 73, President Nixon's domestic  
affairs adviser who was imprisoned for 18 months for the Watergate 
conspiracy, died yesterday of natural causes at his home in 
Atlanta. He had suffered from diabetes, his son said. Ehrlichman 
resigned from his White House post in 1973. He was convicted two 
years later for obstruction of justice, conspiracy and perjury in 
the attempted cover-up of the burglary of the Democratic National 
Committee offices.

	American Resumes Most Flights  
</P>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Most of American Airlines' flights took off as  
scheduled today as negotiations resumed between the company and its 
pilot union on the integration of recently purchased Reno Air. 
American's parent company, AMR Corp., and the Allied Pilots 
Association headed back to the table in virtually the same place 
they were 10 days ago before pilots began calling in sick and 
refusing overtime, canceling thousands of flights and delaying 
travel for more than a half-million passengers. About 800 of 
American's 9,400 pilots were still listed as sick today. 

</P>

	Serbs May Compromise on Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Serbia is willing to make major compromises and  
grant rival ethnic Albanians broad self-rule, but it adamantly 
opposes having NATO troops police a Kosovo agreement, the 
republic's president said today. For the first time since a Kosovo 
peace conference started Feb. 6, Milan Milutinovic indicated Serbs 
were willing to drop most demands that have stalled the talks -- 
with the exception of NATO peacekeeping troops. Milutinovic told 
The Associated Press that abandoning NATO's demands for a 
peacekeeping force was a ``precondition'' for a deal. 

</P>

	Increase Seen in Seat Belt Use  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After being stalled for years, the percentage  
of Americans wearing seat belts increased in 1998 -- the same year 
police organizations started widespread campaigns to enforce seat 
belt laws. The national percentage jumped from 62.2 percent to 65.1 
percent around the Memorial Day holiday, and again from 69.6 
percent to 70.1 percent around the Thanksgiving holiday, said the 
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in figures the

<HEADLINE> Tripp Says Lewinsky Was Suicidal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Linda Tripp said Monday night that Monica  
Lewinsky became suicidal out of fear that President Clinton would 
learn that the former White House intern had confided their 
relationship to friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing on CNN's ``Larry King Live,'' Mrs. Tripp said that Ms.  
Lewinsky was so upset about being treated badly by the president 
that she tracked down Mrs. Tripp and bombarded her with phone calls 
while she was trying to deal with the death of several close family 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to explain to my (then teen-age) children'' about Ms.  
Lewinsky's relationship with the president ``because of the 
incessant phone calls'' from the former intern during the Christmas 
holiday in 1996, Mrs. Tripp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp said Ms. Lewinsky was ``not suicidal'' due to Clinton  
``dumping her'' but because of her ``biggest fear that he would 
find out she shared her story with somebody else. That was part of 
the suicide threat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She revealed that she is ``seriously considering'' writing a  
book about her experiences, a project she said she abandoned in 
1996 because she was afraid of losing her job. That book 
contemplated before the Lewinsky scandal, would have dealt with her 
tenure as a White House aide in the early years of the Clinton 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``From what I'm seeing, the truth is just never going to get out  
there, so to the extent that I may decide to let the truth come out 
I may show what really happened,'' said Mrs. Tripp when asked about 
her plans for a book now. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether New York book agent Luciane Goldberg would be  
representing her, Mrs. Tripp laughed and said, ``I don't know. She 
may not want me.'' Mrs. Goldberg first suggested that Mrs. Tripp 
tape her phone calls with Ms. Lewinsky in order to document the 
relationship with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp also criticized Ms. Lewinsky's mother, Marcia Lewis,  
for taking the view that her daughter's relationship with the 
president ``was OK; more than OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Depicting herself as an older authority figure for Ms. Lewinsky,  
Mrs. Tripp said she made clear to the ex-White House intern that 
``I did not think this was cool'' to be having a relationship with 
Clinton. Mrs. Tripp said she refrained from criticizing Mrs. Lewis 
to Ms. Lewinsky because of the close mother-daughter relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	Tripp's appearance on ``Larry King Live'' was her second  
broadcast appearance in four days. She gave her first in-depth 
interview on NBC's ``Today Show'' last Friday.

<HEADLINE> Oneida Land Claim Brings Strife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VERNON, N.Y. (AP) -- Paul Kobler's great-great-grandfather  
started farming here shortly after the Civil War. For five 
generations, Kobler's kin have poured money and their lives into 
making the land their home. 
</P>
<P>
	Today that heritage is threatened by the long-impoverished, now  
casino-rich Oneida Indian Nation -- with the help of the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	That the Oneidas lost their once vast territory illegally  
matters little to Kobler and more than 20,000 other landowners who 
are suddenly part of a 29-year-old lawsuit seeking to reclaim 
ancestral homelands. They consider themselves pawns in a battle 
among governments -- state, federal and tribal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not giving up my land to no one. I'll do whatever it takes  
to keep it,'' says Kobler, echoing a defiance proclaimed by others 
across two counties just east of Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
	As the governments bicker, residents are left to imagine the  
worst. They have seen in Salamanca, N.Y., what it means when the 
rent comes due on an ancient tribal deal. When the Seneca Indian 
Nation renegotiated leases in 1991 on land that comprises most of 
the western New York city, more than a dozen people were evicted 
and 2,500 others continue to lease the land beneath their homes and 
businesses, at much higher rates. 
</P>
<P>
	For their part, the Oneidas say they don't want to force people  
from their homes but adding them to their moldering land claim was 
the only way to revive it and force an unwilling New York state to 
negotiate in earnest toward settlement, one that may eventually top 
$1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The state can stop this anytime they want -- whenever they want  
to sit down and get serious with negotiations,'' says Ray 
Halbritter, the Oneida Nation's Harvard-educated leader. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials contend it's the Oneidas who are stalling, by  
attaching peripheral demands for slot machines and alcohol sales at 
their casino and by balking at charging sales tax to non-Indians 
who patronize their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The newly targeted landowners have little sympathy for either  
argument. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're telling me I'm guilty of something people did 200  
years ago,'' says Scott Peterman, a landowner who helped mobilize 
Upstate Citizens for Equality, a fast-growing group whose meetings 
are attended by hundreds of vexed property owners. ``I sympathize 
with the plight of the Oneidas, but I don't feel responsible or 
guilty for what happened to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Oneidas once inhabited 6 million acres, stretching from  
northern Pennsylvania to what became the Canadian border. In the 
Revolutionary War, they were the only Iroquois tribe to side with 
colonists, providing aid in critical battles against the British 
and helping feed George Washington's troops at Valley Forge. 
</P>
<P>
	For this assistance, the fledgling U.S. government in 1794  
granted the Oneidas 250,000 acres in present-day Madison and Oneida 
counties and the right to govern themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	But over the next five decades, as New York's frontier was tamed  
and the Erie Canal was dug, Oneida lands were gradually whittled 
away. By 1843, the tribe had less than 800 acres and most Oneidas 
had moved to Wisconsin and Canada. By the early 1990s, the Oneida 
Nation of New York had dwindled to a 32-acre trailer park. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oneidas filed their first lawsuit to recover lost land in  
1970. The U.S. Supreme Court found in 1985 that most of the land 
was seized in questionable transactions with the state and private 
individuals and ruled the Oneidas were entitled to compensation for 
all 250,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, the lawsuit languished as the state and tribe made  
demands and counter-demands at the negotiating table. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, in 1993, the 1,000-member Oneida Nation opened Turning  
Stone, New York's only legal casino, and was rapidly transformed 
into a powerful political and economic force. Last year, 3 million 
people gambled at Turning Stone, making it one of the state's top 
five tourist attractions. 
</P>
<P>
	Their non-Indian neighbors became alarmed as the Oneidas used  
new wealth to buy up 7,000 acres, proclaimed the property 
tax-exempt and opened a chain of tax-free gas stations that have 
put non-Indian merchants at a disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
	But even critics acknowledge the Oneidas' beneficial impact.  
With 3,000 workers, the great majority of them non-Indians, they 
are the area's largest employer. The tribe spends more than $30 
million a year locally for supplies and services and has 
contributed more than $1.5 million to local schools and tourism 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really felt the Oneidas were making an effort to be good  
neighbors, but I certainly don't think good neighbors sue each 
other,'' says Neil Angell, an Oneida County legislator and 
fifth-generation dairy farmer. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not their choice, the Oneidas say.  
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Justice Department intervened in the stalled  
negotiations last December and told the Oneidas that to press on 
with their claim they had to generate fresh litigation. Adding 
property owners was just the thing, federal lawyers advised. A 
hearing on the amended lawsuit is scheduled for March 29 in federal 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one likes to be sued, and we knew that,'' Halbritter says.  
``But the U.S. government intervened because the state wasn't doing 
anything. There was no movement toward a settlement over 14 years 
(since the Supreme Court ruling) and two governors, and for 150 
years before that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither side will discuss specifics. The Oneidas, however,  
recently acknowledged that in 1991, before Turning Stone, they had 
sought $800 million up front, annual payments of $70 million in 
perpetuity and 50,000 acres.

<HEADLINE> Meese Panel Decries Crime Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A task force chaired by former Attorney  
General Edwin Meese III says Congress is sometimes pushed to pass 
``misguided, unnecessary and harmful'' anticrime laws out of fear 
of being considered soft on crime if it fails to act. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel calls on Congress to resist its political impulse. It  
notes with alarm that more than 40 percent of all federal criminal 
laws enacted since the Civil War were passed since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	The task force was sponsored by the American Bar Association and  
chaired by President Reagan's attorney general. After a two-year 
study, its 56-page report will be made public Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is an understandable pressure on Congress not to vote  
against crime legislation even if it is misguided, unnecessary and 
harmful,'' the report's executive summary states. ``But there must 
be a recognition that a refusal to endorse a new federal crime is 
not a sign that a legislator is soft on crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Highly publicized criminal incidents are frequently  
accompanied by proposals for congressional responses for no reason 
other than that the conduct is serious, even if the activity is 
already handled by state law,'' the summary says. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Federalization of Criminal Law'' report mirrors criticism  
raised by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist in his year-end report 
on the federal judiciary in December. He blamed the trend on 
pressure in Congress ``to appear responsive to every highly 
publicized societal ill or sensational crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report states: ``Increased federalization is rarely, if  
ever, likely to have any appreciable effect on the categories of 
violent crime that most concern Americans, because in practice 
federal law enforcement can reach only a small percent of such 
activity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State law enforcement accounts for about 95 percent of all  
prosecutions nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inappropriate federalization'' can contribute to ``long-range  
damage to real crime control'' by diverting federal money better 
spent on state law-enforcement systems, the report says, and can 
deplete funding of federal law-enforcement efforts not duplicated 
by the states. 
</P>
<P>
	``The expanding coverage of federal criminal law, much of it  
enacted in the absence of a demonstrated and distinctive federal 
justification, is moving the nation rapidly toward two broadly 
overlapping, parallel and essentially redundant sets of criminal 
prohibitions ... Such a system has little to commend it and much to 
condemn it,'' the report says. 
</P>
<P>
	Several new federal laws ``championed by many because they would  
have a claimed impact on crime, have hardly been used at all,'' the 
task force found. It cited laws dealing with drive-by shootings, 
interstate domestic violence, failure to report child abuse and 
murder by escaped prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no persuasive evidence that federalization of local  
crime makes the streets safer for American citizens,'' the report 
concludes.

<HEADLINE> Europe Eager for Cash, Coins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AACHEN, Germany (AP) -- Borders and cultural barriers long ago  
ceased to exist here in the lush, medieval region where Germany 
joins Belgium and the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of residents cross from country to country every day.  
They go to restaurants and jobs. They visit friends and shop for 
bargains, from electronic goods and mussels in the Netherlands to 
car parts and chocolates in Belgium. They switch languages easily 
from German to French to Dutch. 
</P>
<P>
	Of all places, Aachen and the other towns and cities in this  
tri-nation zone that calls itself ``the Euregio'' symbolize the 
spirit and purpose of the euro. The common currency is a critical 
step in the grand plan of the European Union, the bold melding of 
once querulous nations into a peaceful, economic-and-monetary bloc.	   Given all the cross-border action, people here are especially 
eager for the day when the euro becomes part of everyday life. But 
while Europe's common currency debuted on financial markets Jan. 1, 
colorful euro bills and coins aren't set to enter circulation until 
Jan. 1, 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Having just one currency will make things a lot easier in the  
Euregio. No more changing money. No more confusing exchange rates. 
No more whipping out the calculator to figure if it really is 
cheaper to have your car repaired in Belgium than in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	On a more emotional level, euro cash will be tactile evidence of  
the region's proud, international attitude, one that dates from the 
9th century, when Charlemagne became Holy Roman Emperor and had his 
court in Aachen. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no more Germany. We're Europe now,'' says Wilhelm  
Neese, a taxi driver whose change box jingles with a mix of German 
marks and Dutch guilders. 
</P>
<P>
	Neese often ferries passengers from Aachen to the Dutch city of  
Maastricht, a 20-minute trip. A small sign, ``Welcome to the 
Netherlands,'' has marked the border since the region tore down its 
passport checkpoints about five years ago, the first to do so after 
the 1985 Schengen Treaty allowed visa-free travel across western 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the euro, some politicians and economists inspired by the  
successful launch in the financial markets are looking for ways to 
speed up the introduction of bills and coins -- a project easier 
said than done. 
</P>
<P>
	Banking officials across the 11-nation euro zone warn they need  
three years to mint and distribute the new money. Countries also 
must set up equipment to handle the euro, such as new cash 
registers and reprogrammed vending machines and automatic tellers. 
</P>
<P>
	Even some people in Aachen are apprehensive.  
</P>
<P>
	``No question -- the euro is going to make our lives much better,  
but we shouldn't rush it,'' says Werner Biermanns, an official in 
the city's chamber of commerce. ``Logistically, there could be too 
many problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problems are so numerous that the best idea for an early  
debut would speed up the introduction of coins and bills by a mere 
three months. European finance ministers are weighing that proposal 
from Belgium, although France and Germany oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
	At the heart of the political debate are questions of public  
opinion: Will Europeans become frustrated if they have to wait too 
long for euro cash? Or do ordinary people -- as well as banks and 
businesses -- need three years to prepare for the daring financial 
experiment. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, public reaction in the Euregio has been a mix of  
caution, enthusiasm and occasional humor. 
</P>
<P>
	Here, as in other locales across the 11-nation euro zone, stores  
and restaurants offer prices in euros alongside the national 
currency, a largely symbolic gesture to help people adjust. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank statements, too, come in euros.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought, where did all my money go?'' Aachen architecture  
student Tillman Lenz says of the first time he saw his account 
reported in euros. Given the exchange rate, the figure was about 
half what it was when the account was in marks. 
</P>
<P>
	Over in Maastricht, where European leaders signed the treaty for  
the common currency in 1991, the market is crowded with Germans, 
Dutch and Belgians shopping for produce, textiles and clothes. 
Vendors accept money from any country but hand out change in Dutch 
guilders, often at random exchange rates ungenerous to the buyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Set prices and exchange rates are one reason Maastricht trade  
official Ardy Assink is looking forward to the euro. Cross-border 
shopping and business deals will be more straightforward, and there 
will be the ease of having to carry only one kind of money. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Assink needs three wallets to keep track of his  
guilders, his German marks and his Belgian francs. ``With the 
euro,'' he says, ``I'll just need one wallet.''

<HEADLINE> Poll: Forget Impeachment Saga </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly three of every four Americans say the  
Senate should drop the Monica Lewinsky matter completely and not 
debate a censure resolution against President Clinton, according to 
a new poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-one percent of those surveyed in the Gallup poll,  
conducted for CNN and USA Today and made public Monday, said they 
were pleased by the Senate's decision not to convict Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventy-three percent of those asked said they would rather see  
the Senate ``drop the matter entirely.'' Twenty-six percent said 
they would like to see the Senate debate a resolution to formally 
censure Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll reflected continuing high support for Clinton, giving  
him an approval rating of 68 percent, 10 points higher than when 
the Lewinsky scandal broke 13 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone survey of 1,034 adults, conducted Friday and  
Saturday, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate poll, The Los Angeles Times reported that most  
Americans think the Senate was right to acquit Clinton of 
impeachment charges and believe Republicans pursued the matter for 
political reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty-five percent of those surveyed after Friday's Senate vote  
supported the acquittal, while 30 percent thought Clinton should 
have been removed from office.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Group Wins Turkmenistan Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHGABAT, Turkmenistan (AP) -- Turkmenistan has awarded a $2.5  
billion contract to an American consortium to build a pipeline for 
bringing natural gas out of the Caspian Sea region. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to grant the project to PSG Corp. -- a consortium  
that includes Bechtel Enterprises Inc. and General Electric Co. -- 
is expected to be officially announced on Friday, President 
Saparmurat Niyazov's birthday, the presidential press service said. 
</P>
<P>
	The pipeline would run from natural gas fields in eastern  
Turkmenistan across the Caspian Sea and further west through 
Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	However, PSG is unlikely to obtain funding for the pipeline  
until Turkmenistan solves a territorial dispute with Azerbaijan, 
and until the five Caspian Sea nations -- Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, 
Kazakstan, Russia and Iran -- agree on the division of the sea's 
rich reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkmenistan sits on vast reserves of oil and natural gas, but  
the absence of export pipelines has kept the former Soviet republic 
mired in poverty.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Push Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WARREN, Mich. (AP) -- Republican leaders spent Presidents Day  
trying to put impeachment behind them and map out the future of the 
GOP agenda by promoting their $743 billion tax cut proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott joined Michigan Gov. John  
Engler, Sen. Spence Abraham and Rep. Joe Knollenberg for a town 
hall-type meeting in front of about 400 people. A banner behind 
them spelled out their slogan: ``Listening to America -- Tax Cuts 
for Everyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, R-Miss., said the answer over what to do with a federal  
budget surplus estimated at $2.56 trillion over the next decade was 
clear: ``Do you want all this surplus spent by Washington, or do 
you want it returned to the people?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mostly partisan crowd at the Ukrainian Cultural Center  
didn't bring up impeachment but did ask about military spending, 
cable TV rates and campaign finance reform. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Republicans have agreed with President Clinton's idea that  
62 percent of the surplus should go to keep Social Security 
solvent. The Republican tax plan would use much of the remainder to 
fund a 10 percent income tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	The lowest tax bracket, currently at 15 percent, would drop to  
13.5 percent, while the top bracket of 39.6 percent would go to 
35.64 percent. Republicans said the cut would save a single person 
earning $35,000 a year about $455, and a married couple earning 
$60,000 would save $780. 
</P>
<P>
	The congressional Republicans said their 1997 budget and tax  
cuts were responsible for the strong economy, and their 
across-the-board plan would be more popular than the specific cuts 
proposed by Clinton in his State of the Union speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's picking winners and losers, and he's trying to give  
something to everybody in the room,'' said Knollenberg, R-Mich. 
``We believe in less taxes and less government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Republicans also said they would favor eliminating a few  
specific taxes, including the estate tax and the marriage penalty, 
a quirk in the tax code in which millions of two-income couples pay 
more tax than if they weren't married. 
</P>
<P>
	One Democrat, Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, said the plan is  
biased too much in favor of the wealthy. ``The Republican plan 
sends 60 percent of the tax cut to the top 10 percent of the 
taxpayers,'' he said. ``We should not be redistributing (the 
surplus) to wealthy people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also called the town hall an attempt by Republicans to change  
the subject following the impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott predicted that the impeachment trial would fade from  
everyone's memory fast -- including the major players. He noted that 
the day after he voted to remove Clinton from office for ``high 
crimes and misdemeanors and low-down behavior,'' the president 
called him at home to talk about Kosovo and other matters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked about President Clinton's mistakes for a year,''  
Lott said. ``He was not found guilty, and it's time to move on with 
the people's business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said Republicans will hold about 150 similar meetings in  
the coming year to promote their plans and get feedback from the 
public.

<HEADLINE>  Reggie White Retires From Football </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- This time, Reggie White put it in writing.  
</P>
<P>
	The NFL's career sacks leader turned in his retirement letter to  
Green Bay Packers general manager Ron Wolf on Monday -- and gave no 
indication he intends to return. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's officially retired. It's over. I think he's had it,''  
Packers spokesman Lee Remmel said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old White had said last season would be his last.  
But there were hints the All-Pro player might change his mind after 
the Packers hired his longtime friend, Ray Rhodes, as head coach to 
replace Mike Holmgren. 
</P>
<P>
	White wound up making 16 sacks and earning Defensive Player of  
the Year honors in what was to be his farewell season, and that 
also raised speculation he might not be ready to retire. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came reports during the weekend that a return by White  
would cause trouble for the Packers in staying within the NFL 
salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
	White, an ordained minister, told Milwaukee station WITI-TV that  
the only factor in his decision was ``what I think the Lord wants 
me to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last April, White said he intended to retire. But after  
repeating to Holmgren he wouldn't come back, White said he had a 
revelation while having back therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	``God spoke to me and said you made a promise,'' White said at  
the time. ``When I signed the deal last year, I signed a five-year 
deal with the promise that I would play for two years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, after the Packers lost to San Francisco in the  
playoffs, White said he expected to retire and focus on his other 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
	But when he was in Hawaii earlier this month for his record 11th  
Pro Bowl appearance, he seemed to leave a slight opening when he 
told an interviewer he was ``intrigued'' about the idea of 
returning to play under Rhodes. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Ray got the job, if anyone else had gotten the job I  
wouldn't have been intrigued,'' White told Fox television at the 
time. ``I've really been praying about it and thinking about it. 
Right now I'm retired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf had acknowledged the Packers were counting on White's $4.4  
million salary to provide room under the salary cap to pay 
defensive tackle Santana Dotson and linebacker George Koonce under 
the long-term deals they agreed to last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The team also has yet to sign All-Pro wide receiver Antonio  
Freeman, who was designated last week as the Packers' franchise 
player. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers this week lost their first free agent since the  
signing period began, as guard Adam Timmerman signed a five-year 
contract with the St. Louis Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf and Holmgren brought White to Green Bay as a free agent in  
April 1993, and the longtime Philadelphia Eagles star helped return 
the Packers to the Super Bowl for the first time in almost three 
decades in January 1997, when they beat New England 35-21. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf told the Green Bay Press-Gazette on Monday that the NFL has  
asked teams not to retire more player numbers, but don't expect to 
see White's No. 92 on the field any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Already retired by the Packers are Tony Canadeo's No. 3, Don  
Hutson's No. 14, Bart Starr's No. 15 and Ray Nitschke's No. 66. 
</P>
<P>
	``The league has asked all of us to not retire numbers  
anymore,'' Wolf said. ``I'd think we'll retire the jersey, not the 
number, if you know what I mean. But I can say this: No one will 
wear that number as long as I'm here.''

<HEADLINE> Joyner's Daughter Gives Inspiration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Only 8 years old, Mary Joyner is filling the  
breach left by the death of her mother, providing mental and 
spiritual inspiration for her father. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason I'm still alive is because of my daughter,'' Al  
Joyner, the husband of the late Florence Griffith Joyner, said 
Monday at the New York Track Writers' luncheon. ``I never thought 
I'd say that. Florence laid the foundation for Mary. She's gotten 
her strong personality and beliefs from her mother. Recently, she 
said her mother was very brave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith Joyner not only was courageous, she was the world's  
fastest woman in 1988, when she won Olympic gold medals in the 100 
and 200 meters and the 400 relay and set world records in the two 
individual events. She died last Sept. 21 at 38 when she was 
stricken with a seizure as she slept and suffocated. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the lives of Al and Mary have been tumultuous and  
filled with grief. Joyner said a day hasn't gone by that thoughts 
of his wife haven't filled his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the hardest thing I've had to deal with in my life,'' he  
said. ``I'm finding out hard hard it is to raise a kid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On many of those occasions, his precocious daughter has provided  
an uplift. 
</P>
<P>
	Joyner recalled one poignant moment, three weeks after his  
wife's death. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Mary were visiting Universal Studios in Los Angeles, a  
popular family gathering place. Suddenly, Joyner, recalling the 
good times he and Florence had enjoyed before her death, put his 
head down and began crying. 
</P>
<P>
	Immediately, his daughter provided the proper soothing words.  
</P>
<P>
	``She said when God calls us home, we'll see mommy again,'' the  
emotional Joyner said. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been many other touching moments.  
</P>
<P>
	``When I put her to sleep, she says I don't want anything to  
happen to you,'' Joyner said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's been a joy. She's able to know what happened to her  
mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``She says things like, `Mommy would have looked good in that  
dress.' 
</P>
<P>
	``She's all right. I see why she's concerned about me, because  
I'm not all right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another time last year, when Joyner was addressing his  
daughter's class, he told the pupils he was 26. 
</P>
<P>
	``She embarrassed me,'' he said, jokingly. ``She said I was  
38.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Little Mary, a third-grader who had been a gymnast, now has  
taken up running, just like her mother. However, she not only likes 
sprinting but hurdling, an event in which her father dabbled after 
winning the Olympic gold medal in the triple jump in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's now putting up hurdles in the house and jumping over  
them,'' Joyner said. ``She can clear women's hurdles (33 inches 
high). She's even impressed a lot of people at UCLA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a sprinter, she keeps beating everyone in her school, St.  
John's in Mission Viejo, CaIif., her proud father said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They keep challenging her, and she keeps beating them,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They keep asking her if she is going back to gymnastics. She  
keeps putting up hurdles. She went to UCLA and showed the freshmen 
the drills. It was embarrassing. She uses the balance beam in the 
house as a hurdle. And she had me acting as a hurdle. She told me 
to get down on the floor and she jumped over me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joyner was in town to promote Florence's book, ``Running for  
Dummies,'' which he finished after his wife died. 
</P>
<P>
	``I share my wife's wishes and dreams,'' he said. ``She put her  
heart and soul into that book. She was an inspiration.''

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks End Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks rose today for the third  
consecutive trading day, supported by last week's government 
decision to pump public funds into the nation's major banks. The 
dollar slipped against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 81.03 points,  
or 0.58 percent, closing the day's trading at 14,054.72. On Friday, 
the index rose 21.29 points, or 0.15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 114.08 yen in late afternoon trading, down  
0.24 yen from its level Friday in Tokyo and also below its New York 
level of 114.21 yen on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan announced on Friday a plan to inject $66  
billion in public funds into 15 major banks in an attempt to 
prevent Japan's banking system from collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks also got a boost after the central bank said late Friday  
it was cutting a key interest rate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan's policy board lowered its target for  
overnight call money -- the rate banks charge each other for 
unsecured short-term loans -- to an all-time low of 0.15 percent 
from 0.25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower interest rates tend to cut borrowing costs for companies,  
helping to spur the nation's economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not as though the banks' bad loan problems will be  
solved with this measure,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager of 
the stock division at Tokyo Securities. ``But at least it relieves 
worries about the banks having a capital shortage come the end of 
the fiscal year in March,'' Hatae said. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 338  
million shares, down from Friday's turnover of 452 million shares. 
Advances outnumbered declines 659 to 448, with 173 issues 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 5.49 points, or 0.50 percent, to 1,095.02. The 
TOPIX rose 6.44 points, or 0.59 percent, Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, trading remained thin ahead of the U.S.  
national holiday today and the Chinese New Year holidays in Hong 
Kong and Singapore on Tuesday and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the market largely shrugged off other potential  
market-moving factors today, including rising U.S.-Japan trade 
friction over steel and figures showing that Japan's current 
account surplus rose by 13 percent in December from a year earlier, 
pushing the total for all of 1998 to a record high. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 128.70 yen, up from  
128.54 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 2.135 percent from Friday's finish of 2.080 percent, 
driving its price down to 97.39 yen from 97.81 yen.

<HEADLINE>  Earnhardt, Gordon Dueled to the End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Dale Earnhardt gave Jeff Gordon a  
push just when he needed it most. 
</P>
<P>
	The strategy backfired -- and Earnhardt, of all people, should  
have known better at the Daytona 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt chose Gordon as his partner in a late-race move to the  
front that set up a thrilling showdown Sunday in NASCAR's biggest 
event. 
</P>
<P>
	A few laps later, The Intimidator had learned his lesson -- and  
seen his chance for a second straight Daytona 500 victory lost in 
the exhaust of the Kid's steadfast driving and dominating car. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was trying all I could do to get to the 24,'' Earnhardt said  
of the final dash for the title. 
</P>
<P>
	``His car was pretty strong off the corners. If I could have  
just got to him in the corner, I might could have got under him, 
but I just couldn't get there. I got beat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, but what a way to go down.  
</P>
<P>
	The drama began with 10 laps remaining, when Gordon slid under  
leader Rusty Wallace heading toward the first turn. He then 
squeezed past Ricky Rudd's lapped car, avoiding a crash by about a 
foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt's teammate, Mike Skinner, moved alongside Wallace on  
the outside and they drove three-wide into turn three. 
</P>
<P>
	With Earnhardt bumping Gordon from the back to help him get by,  
Gordon came out in front at the flagstand. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was definitely bumping me back there and I wanted him to,''  
Gordon said. ``I was saying, `Come on, hit me harder.' He wasn't 
hitting me hard enough as far as I was concerned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few laps later, Earnhardt made a move and racing fans got an  
exciting duel seen all too seldom during a pair of great careers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though we battled for a (series) championship in '95, we  
really didn't get to have many tight battles all the way to the 
finish,'' Gordon said. ``I really can't think of a better way to do 
it than here at the Daytona 500.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once it became a two-man race, Gordon set the pace, slowing and  
speeding at the perfect times, keeping just the right amount of air 
between their cars to prevent Earnhardt from using the draft to 
slingshot past him. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt's best hope would have been to get a bump from  
Skinner, but he was in fourth, pinned behind rookie Kenny Irwin. 
Asked if he could have used Skinner's help, Earnhardt snapped. 
</P>
<P>
	``How do you take a car out from between us and get (Skinner)  
behind me,'' he said. ``It's not like he can say, `Hey, I'm moving 
up,' and just drive over the other guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the final lap, Earnhardt zigged in, zagged out, zigged in  
again, then made one desperate lunge at Gordon before the finish 
line. 
</P>
<P>
	Each time he tried to get by, Gordon blocked him. Only a  
quarter-mile after the race ended did the seven-time Winston Cup 
winner catch up, giving a victory-lap nudge to congratulate him. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I'm concerned, especially at Daytona, Dale is so  
good,'' Gordon said. ``He knows the air very, very well. And he 
knows how to make passes without getting help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he had given it to exactly the wrong guy.  
</P>
<P>
	So, there was no celebration for Earnhardt, no using his car to  
carve circles in the grass, the way he did last year when he 
finally took the only major championship to elude him over his 
25-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	And there was no repeat, a la John Elway, the Denver Broncos  
quarterback who won two straight Super Bowls and inspired 
Earnhardt. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, it was his fifth second-place finish at Daytona, making  
him the all-time leader in that category, passing Cale Yarbrough. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were happy to get second, but we sure would love to be down  
there in Victory Lane,'' Earnhardt said. ``We've had a good week 
here. Everything worked good for us in the qualifying races and we 
had a good day here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also was one of the best finishes in the 41-year history of  
the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Earnhardt left thinking of one way it could have been  
even better.

<HEADLINE> Marv Albert Signs With Turner Sports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The local fans already have welcomed back Marv  
Albert. Now he'll see if the reception is any different around the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert is returning to national prominence, agreeing Monday to a  
multiyear contract with Turner Sports to broadcast NBA games and 
other sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert, fired by NBC in 1997 after pleading guilty to biting a  
woman during a sexual encounter in a Virginia hotel room, is 
scheduled to make his debut on TNT's broadcast of the Los Angeles 
Lakers game at Phoenix on April 2. 
</P>
<P>
	He has fulfilled the terms of his probation, and his record has  
been cleared. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone has been so favorable in New York at the games and  
walking on the street,'' Albert said at a news conference in 
Madison Square Garden. ``I just hope it continues and people 
continue to react that way, but it's out of my control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albert worked his first NBA game in nearly 20 months on Feb. 8,  
when he called the Knicks home opener on radio for the Madison 
Square Garden Network. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans lined up for autographs and voiced their support for  
Albert's return. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the darkest hours, I had no idea what would unfold in my  
life,'' Albert said. ``But I had to get past that. A year ago I was 
just wondering if I'd get back, but I think everything has turned 
out well in the long run when you look at my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He will work six regular-season games this season for Turner  
with analyst Reggie Theus, then will be placed in the regular 
announcing rotation during the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert may be paired with different partners during the  
postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hiring is a step in the right direction for Marv to make a  
strong comeback,'' said Turner analyst and former NBA coach Hubie 
Brown. ``It also adds another quality announcer to our stable of 
people. The way people should look at it is that Turner is giving 
him a chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning next season, Albert will become a fulltime member of  
the Turner on-air staff, announcing a full slate of about 25 
regular-season games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel that Marv is one of the top play-by-play announcers in  
the business,'' Turner Sports executive producer Mike Pearl said. 
``The concerns we had were that he was taking care of himself on a 
personal note. We have the confidence in our decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of Albert's games on Turner this season will come on Friday  
nights on TNT in order to accommodate his obligations with Madison 
Square Garden, which will continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so happy with this situation,'' Albert said. ``I don't  
know what's in store down the road. I'm just so thrilled to be 
doing NBA on national basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albert returned to New York's MSG in September as a weeknight  
anchor its wrap-up show, ``SportsDesk.'' Besides NBA games, he also 
may work boxing for Turner along with the 2001 Goodwill Games and 
possibly the pro football league Turner and NBC are planning to 
launch. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert's last national telecast was the NBA Finals in 1997 with  
NBC, where he worked for 20 years. Later that year, after the 
trial, he was fired by NBC and resigned from the MSG Network. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be great to see Marv return to television and work in  
the sport he loves,'' NBC spokesman Ed Markey said. ``We're happy 
to have him back as part of the NBA family.''

<HEADLINE> Independent Counsel May Be History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Independent Counsel Act that grew out of  
the Watergate scandal and culminated in Kenneth Starr's 
investigation of President Clinton is headed for extinction in 
June, lawmakers from both parties say. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing we can do in this Congress is not extend the life of  
the independent counsel statute. It was a post-Watergate liberal 
notion and it was a disaster,'' Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, 
D-N.Y., said Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This law needs to terminated. I don't want it to be amended. I  
want it to be ended,'' Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said on CNN's 
``Late Edition.'' He noted that he was one of 21 senators who had 
voted against reauthorizing the act after it lapsed in the early 
1990s. It will die on June 30 unless Congress and Clinton renew it. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress passed the law in 1978 as a post-Watergate means to  
ensure that investigations into the president, his Cabinet and 
other top officials would be free of politics. Under the act, the 
attorney general can ask a court to appoint an independent counsel 
when there is compelling evidence that a senior federal official is 
guilt of wrongdoing and a Justice Department investigation might 
give the appearance of a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans were displeased with the independent counsel's  
treatment of the Reagan administration during the Iran-Contra 
affair and Democrats have accused Starr of abusing his powers in 
his four-year, $40 million probe of the White House. It started 
with the Whitewater land deal and proceeded through the White House 
travel office firings, the handling of FBI files and finally the 
Monica Lewinsky affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Both parties have questioned the Office of Independent Counsel's  
nearly unlimited powers to spend money. Prosecutor Donald Smaltz 
spent $17 million in a four-year corruption case against former 
Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, who was acquitted of the charges 
six weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno has sought the appointment of seven  
independent counsels to investigate Clinton administration 
officials, but Republicans have criticized her refusal to use the 
act to look into Clinton's and Vice President Al Gore's possible 
links to alleged Democratic fund-raising violations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's either going to be rewritten significantly or it will be  
allowed to lapse -- in all likelihood the latter,'' Senate 
Republican Whip Don Nickles of Oklahoma said on ABC's ``This 
Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congress is expected to hold hearings on the act in the coming  
weeks, but McConnell said Congress might simply kill it by failing 
to act on its reauthorization. 
</P>
<P>
	While the administration has not taken a final stance, ``it's  
virtually hopeless to try to fix it, I think, without some major, 
major revisions,'' White House chief of staff John Podesta said on 
NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Bar Association, which helped craft the Independent  
Counsel Act two decades ago, decided to end support for the law in 
a 384-49 vote by its House of Delegates last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was designed to remove politics from the investigation of  
public officials,'' said Philip Anderson, who heads the 
400,000-member organization of lawyers. ``The majority of Americans 
would say that politics has not been removed.''

<HEADLINE> American Airlines' Flights Resuming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- With a growing number of American Airlines pilots  
reporting for duty, airline officials think they can resume regular 
service this week. 
</P>
<P>
	As of late Sunday, ``well under 1,000'' of American's 9,400  
pilots were still listed as sick, compared to the nearly 2,500 
Thursday and Friday who declared themselves unfit to fly, an 
American spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just glad they are coming back and we hope by the end of  
the week to be in business as usual here,'' said Sonja Whitemon, 
adding that 100 percent service was possible by Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	However, about 231 flights, or about 10 percent, scheduled for  
today have been canceled because not all of the pilots were 
immediately available for flying. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half a million travelers have been left at the gate by  
the nation's second-largest airline since Feb. 6. That's when a 
large number of pilots started calling in sick in a dispute 
concerning how quickly American should integrate the pilots from 
recently purchased Reno Air into its own roster. 
</P>
<P>
	According to American, pilots have been taking themselves off of  
the sick list at a rapid rate since a federal judge held the Allied 
Pilots Association and two top board members in contempt of an 
order that pilots return to work. He promised sizable fines against 
the union. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the continued cancellations, most of the nation's  
airports were calmer Sunday with many passengers prepared for 
delays. 
</P>
<P>
	At Miami International Airport, heart-shaped decorations adorned  
American's baggage counter wall and musicians strolled through the 
terminal serenading passengers. But many travelers remained angry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I lost two to three years of age off my life,'' said  
Luis Delgado, a furniture exporter who faced delays in three cities 
over four days while trying to get home to Santo Domingo, Dominican 
Republic. ``This is not my problem, it's American Airlines. We 
don't have to be the ones that suffer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall said he would decide Wednesday  
how much to levy in fines. He required the union to place $10 
million with the court and for union president Rich LaVoy and vice 
president Brian Mayhew to remit a total of $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we are disappointed and disagree with Judge Kendall's  
order of contempt, we urge all pilots to comply with the 
restraining order,'' LaVoy said. ``We're taking his order 
seriously. I took his order seriously Wednesday night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations on the Reno pilot issue are scheduled to restart  
this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 6,000 flights have been canceled since the work action  
began, costing American between $67 million and $90 million, 
according to Chris Chiames, a spokesman for AMR Corp., parent 
company of American Airlines.

<HEADLINE> Book: Mrs. Ramsey Tough With Cops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- JonBenet Ramsey's mother revealed ``the  
hard side of her persona'' when questioned by a detective, leading 
authorities to suspect she was capable of harming her daughter, 
author Lawrence Schiller writes in a new book on the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The book, ``Perfect Murder -- Perfect Town,'' draws on nearly 600  
interviews with key players in the investigation to unveil 
never-before reported details about the unsolved slaying of the 
6-year-old beauty queen. 
</P>
<P>
	After Detective Tom Haney interviewed Patsy Ramsey June 23-25,  
police reviewing a videotape believed he had ``gotten to the real 
Patsy,'' according to excerpts released by Newsweek Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``She had exhibited the hard side of her persona,'' Schiller  
wrote in the book, to be released later this week. ``A side capable 
of bringing harm to her daughter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Haney told Mrs. Ramsey that she had lied to him, Mrs.  
Ramsey replied, ``Pal, you don't want to go there. Don't start 
that,'' Schiller wrote. ``The tougher the questions became, the 
tougher Patsy became.'' 
</P>
<P>
	JonBenet's beaten and strangled body was found Dec. 26, 1996 in  
the basement of the Ramseys' Boulder home, about seven hours after 
Mrs. Ramsey called 911 and said she found a ransom note demanding 
$118,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have said the Ramseys remain under suspicion in  
JonBenet's death, while the Ramseys have repeatedly maintained 
their innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Hal Haddon, who represents JonBenet's parents, declined  
comment Sunday because he had not had a chance to read the book. 
</P>
<P>
	Schiller theorized that JonBenet's killer was familiar with the  
house and knew where the family kept the blanket in which her body 
had been wrapped. 
</P>
<P>
	Schiller also revealed police evidence which was presented to  
District Attorney Alex Hunter on June 1-2, before the interview 
with Haney, according to excerpts of the book printed in the Rocky 
Mountain News of Denver today. 
</P>
<P>
	The police presentation helped convince Hunter to take the case  
to a grand jury, which is now hearing evidence. A spokeswoman for 
Hunter declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The evidence included the Colorado Bureau of Investigation's  
conclusion that four fibers found on the duct tape that had covered 
JonBenet's mouth were consistent with the jacket Mrs. Ramsey wore 
Christmas night, Schiller wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the cord and duct tape used on JonBenet likely had  
been purchased by Mrs. Ramsey at McGuckin hardware store in 
Boulder, he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Police also told Hunter that the fine-line Sharpie pen used to  
write the ransom note was one that Mrs. Ramsey had used before and 
was found in a cup ``right beside the phone in the kitchen where 
Patsy always kept them,'' Schiller wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The author said that some listening to the police presentation  
suspected JonBenet had wet her bed and Mrs. Ramsey had reacted 
violently, accidentally killing her, then she and John Ramsey 
covered it up. 
</P>
<P>
	Schiller, who assisted O.J. Simpson on his book ``I Want to Tell  
You,'' and co-wrote ``American Tragedy: The Uncensored Story of the 
Simpson Defense,'' also worked with Norman Mailer on his Pulitzer 
Prize-winning ``The Executioner's Song.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there will be a resolution to the case,'' Schiller  
said. ``I think all the evidence will come out, but that doesn't 
mean someone will be convicted.''

<HEADLINE> Quantrill Not Sure When He'll Pitch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUNEDIN, Fla. (AP) -- Toronto Blue Jays right-hander Paul  
Quantrill, rehabilitating a broken right leg, isn't sure when he'll 
be ready to pitch again. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just going to depend when the muscles are back,'' he said  
Monday at the Blue Jays' spring training complex. ``One day 
something's bothering me, and three days later it's 100 percent 
better. I've already started throwing and doing as much of my 
normal routine as possible, like every year. But I haven't thrown 
off a mound yet. It's coming back real quick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quantrill, broke his right leg in a snowmobile accident Jan. 6.  
He was 3-4 with seven saves and a 2.59 ERA in 82 games last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got a really good therapist and the Blue Jays have been  
helping me out a lot,'' Quantrill said. ``But chasing my two kids 
around on one or two legs gets you better, pretty quick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quantrill is using a cane to get around. The Blue Jays project  
him to return around the end of May. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did the crutch thing long enough,'' he said. ``I don't need  
them now, and the crutch is so that I don't limp. ... When I walk 
the muscle gives out a little bit, and the cane is just there to 
make sure I don't form a habit of limping.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quantrill's contract calls for a $1.4 million salary this year,  
but because snowmobiling falls into ``risky activity'' territory, 
the Blue Jays may be within their rights to void his contract in 
exchange for 30 days' pay, about $235,000. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the snowmobile is idle.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's just sitting out there, staring at me and calling my  
name,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Hints at Mexico Ally Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MERIDA, Mexico (AP) -- President Clinton offered a strong hint  
Monday that he will certify Mexico as a reliable ally in the 
difficult struggle against drugs, saying cooperation ``has clearly 
improved'' under President Ernesto Zedillo. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Mexico's disappointing record on extraditions and a drop  
last year in cocaine and heroin seizures, Clinton found positive 
things to say about Mexico's efforts. He welcomed a plan announced 
two weeks ago to invest up to $500 million in a new anti-drug 
initiative and declared, ``The United States is ready to do all we 
can to support you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By law, the president has to judge Mexico's performance on drugs  
by March 1. Mexico would be hit with economic penalties if Clinton 
gave it a failing grade. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Zedillo conferred at a hacienda with manicured  
gardens in the middle of Merida's Mayan archeological zone and then 
addressed 1,400 people in the domed Peon Contreras Theater in 
downtown Merida. Hundreds of people lined the narrow, tree-shaded 
street leading to the theater. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's trip was his first outing since his acquittal  
Friday in the Senate's impeachment trial. Repeating his wish after 
the verdict, Clinton said, ``I think this is a time for 
reconciliation and renewal. I think what we have to do is to serve 
the American people. And if we keep that in mind I think everything 
will be fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Attorney General Janet  
Reno, Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, drug policy 
coordinator Barry McCaffrey and Export-Import Bank chief James 
Harmon signed a series of agreements with their Mexican 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	The key initiative was a two-year, $4 billion line of Ex-Im  
credit for Mexican businesses that ``buy American.'' In addition, a 
civil aviation accord will liberalize flights between the United 
States and Mexico, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of 
dollars to airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Another accord was aimed at promoting border safety and human  
rights, addressing Mexican complaints about the deaths of illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton won applause when he noted that Mexico is the largest  
Spanish-speaking country in the world and added, ``Before long, the 
United States will be the second largest Spanish speaking country 
in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said that he and Zedillo ``made progress in areas today  
where, to be charitable, we have not always agreed. Not long ago, 
we could not have had a conversation about drugs without falling 
into an unwinnable argument about who is to blame. That has 
changed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The American people recognize we must reduce our demand for  
drugs,'' the president said. ``The Mexican people recognize that 
ending the drug trade is a national security and public health 
imperative for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In turn, Zedillo called Clinton and his wife, Hillary, ``dearest  
friends,'' and displayed a touch of nationalist pride when he said: 
``For Mexicans, the commitment to fight drugs is first and foremost 
a commitment to ourselves, to our children ... to our safety and to 
our future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mexican president said his people were ``convinced and  
determined to keep up the fight against drugs until we win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Mexican priority, Zedillo said, is ``a safe, clean and  
productive border -- a source of pride for the communities that 
share that border.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen early Tuesday on  
reports the Japanese government may take steps to curb the recent 
rise in long-term interest rates. Japanese stocks surged higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 115.82 yen in early trading, up 1.74 yen from  
late Monday in Tokyo. U.S. markets were closed Monday for the 
Presidents Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark No. 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 206.92  
points, or 1.47 percent, to 14,261.64 points in the first 30 
minutes of trading. On Monday, the average closed up 81.03 points, 
or 0.58 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar's advance came after local news  
reports Tuesday that the government has decided that the Finance 
Ministry's Trust Fund Bureau will temporarily resume its purchases 
of Japanese government bonds to bring interest rates down. 
</P>
<P>
	The bond market was rocked recently when the buruea, which  
manages public pension funds and deposits from the country's 
massive postal savings system, announced it would discontinue 
purchases of government bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Kyodo News agency also said the government will reduce the  
amount of long-term government bonds to be issued next month. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.940 percent from Monday's finish of 2.140 percent, 
driving its price up to 98.89 yen from 98.35 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 130.66 yen, up  
128.70 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower interest rates tend to reduce borrowing costs for  
companies, and could help spur economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, export-oriented auto issues such as Toyota  
Motor and Honda Motor led the way as investors were cheered up by 
the yen's retreat against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	A weaker yen tends to make Japanese exports cheaper aboard and  
thus more competitive, helping to boost earnings of export-led 
Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
exchange's first section added 9.20 points, or 0.84 percent, to 
1,104.22. The TOPIX closed up 5.49 points, or 0.50 percent, the day 
before.

	American Airlines Gets Set to Fly  
</P>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- American Airlines expects to operate almost  
normally tomorrow following 10 days during which more than 6,000 
flights were canceled due to a pilot sickout. About 250 of the 
2,250 flights scheduled today were canceled. But AMR Corp., 
American's parent company, and the pilots resumed talks over the 
integration of the recently purchased Reno Air. At its worst, 
nearly 2,500 of American's 9,400 pilots went on the sick list last 
week, forcing the airline to cancel more than half of its 2,250 
scheduled flights each day.

	Tripp Says Lewinsky Was Suicidal  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Linda Tripp said tonight that Monica Lewinsky  
became suicidal out of fear that President Clinton would learn that 
the former White House intern had confided their relationship to 
friends. Appearing on CNN's ``Larry King Live,'' Tripp said that 
Lewinsky was ``not suicidal'' due to Clinton ``dumping her'' but 
because of her ``biggest fear that he would find out she shared her 
story with somebody else.'' She revealed that she is ``seriously 
considering'' writing a book about her experiences, a project she 
said she abandoned in 1996 because she was afraid of losing her 
job.

	Clinton Seeks New Start

	MERIDA, Mexico (AP) -- On the first outing since his acquittal in  
the Senate impeachment trial, President Clinton called today for a 
fresh political start. ``I think this is a time for reconciliation 
and renewal,'' he told reporters during summit talks in Mexico. ``I 
think what we have to do is to serve the American people. And if we 
keep that in mind I think everything will be fine. We can't solve 
the challenges of Social Security and Medicare and education and 
these other things, we can't keep the international economy going 
unless we have a level of cooperation.''

	U.S.-Mexico Summit Held  
</P>
<P>
	MERIDA, Mexico (AP) -- President Clinton today hinted that he  
will officially certify Mexico as a reliable U.S. ally in the war 
on drugs. At summit talks, he said cooperation ``has clearly 
improved'' under President Ernesto Zedillo. Mexico's record on 
extraditions and on cocaine and heroin seizures had been seen as a 
problem. However, Clinton welcomed a plan to invest up to $500 
million in a new anti-drug initiative. ``The United States is ready 
to do all we can to support you,'' Clinton vowed.

	U.S. Warns Iraq on Threat

<P>
	MERIDA, Mexico (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright  
warned today the U.S. ``response would be swift and sure'' if Iraq 
attacked the Turkish base American planes are using to patrol its 
skies. Iraqi vice president Taha Yassin Ramadan threatened that 
Iraq will attack the Incirlik base if American jets keep 
patrolling. Today U.S. warplanes fired on defense sites in northern 
Iraq, the Defense Department said in Washington. The Pentagon said 
the planes returned safely to Incirlik.

natural causes at his home in Atlanta. He had suffered from 
diabetes, his son said. Ehrlichman went to prison in 1976 and 
served 18 months for obstruction of justice, conspiracy and 
perjury. He quit politics, moved to Santa Fe, N.M., wrote political 
novels and became a radio commentator.

<HEADLINE> Duke Stays No. 1 in AP Hoops Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Duke, Connecticut and Auburn held the top three spots in the AP  
college basketball poll Monday. Then came changes galore following 
losses by 10 ranked teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils (25-1) stayed a resounding No. 1, receiving 64  
first-place votes and 1,744 points from the national media panel 
after breaking the 100-point mark twice and winning by an average 
of 38.5 points in their two games last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut (22-1), which also won twice last week, got the  
other six No. 1 votes and 1,677 points, 72 more than Auburn (24-1), 
which also went 2-0 last week, winning by an average of 35 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State moved up one spot to fourth, and Maryland and  
Kentucky each jumped two places to fifth and sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford, which beat then-No. 9 UCLA and lost to Southern  
California, dropped from sixth to seventh, while Arizona moved up 
two places No. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati, which lost to Marquette and Saint Louis last week  
and is on a three-game losing streak, fell from fourth to No. 9, 
its lowest ranking since jumping to sixth in late November after 
beating then-No. 1 Duke in the Great Alaska Shootout. 
</P>
<P>
	St. John's moved up one place to round out the Top Ten.  
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State moved from No. 13 to 11th, the Buckeyes' highest  
ranking since being No. 3 in the final poll of the 1991-92 season. 
They were followed by Utah, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Miami, UCLA, 
Purdue, College of Charleston, Indiana and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The last five teams in the poll were Syracuse, Missouri,  
Florida, New Mexico and Miami of Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri and Miami of Ohio both returned to the rankings for the  
second time this season, while Minnesota and Kansas dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers (18-5) were 24th two weeks ago, their first poll  
appearance since December 1995, but dropped out following a loss to 
Nebraska. They return after victories over Iowa State and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami of Ohio (19-4) was ranked in the second and third polls of  
the regular season, but dropped out following losses to Xavier and 
Wisconsin-Green Bay. The RedHawks, who hadn't been ranked since the 
final poll of the 1977-78 season, returned to the Top 25 having won 
seven straight and 12 of 13. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the first time since the AP poll began in 1949 that both  
Miamis were ranked at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota (14-8) fell out from 22nd after losing last week to  
Iowa and Michigan State. The Golden Gophers had joined the Top 25 
in the fourth poll of the season and had gotten as high as No. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas (16-8), which had been No. 24, lost to Nebraska and Texas  
Tech last week to drop out after returning from a one-week absence. 
The Jayhawks had been ranked in every poll for the previous eight 
years before dropping out the first time this season. 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA, which took the week's biggest fall in dropping from No. 9  
to 16th, was the fourth ranked team to lose two games last week, 
losing to Stanford and California.

<HEADLINE> Group Protests Fat-Bashing Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- More than 30 overweight people chanted  
``Eat me!'' while performing aerobics on the sidewalk in front of a 
health club to protest a new ad campaign they say demoralizes fat 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``fat advocates'' banded together to protest a 24 Hour  
Fitness billboard campaign that depicts a hungry space alien and 
reads ``When they come, they will eat the fat ones first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials say they didn't intend to offend anyone.  
``Sometimes humor helps make things easier, and can even be 
motivational,'' 24 Hour Fitness officials said in a release. 
</P>
<P>
	But the protesters said they saw little humor in the ad.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's really hard for fat people to get into the gym anyway. To  
alienate them before they even walk in the door is cruel,'' said 
Rebekah Bridges, who handed out lollipops to passersby. 
</P>
<P>
	``I may be fat, but I'm fit, I'm happy, I'm sexual, I'm all of  
those things. How dare an ad man decide for society that we're not 
allowed to be someplace,'' Ms. Bridges said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others waved handwritten signs that read ``Bite My Fat, Alien  
Butt,'' ``Fat and Fit'' and ``Honk If You're Fat,'' which received 
loud support from traffic on the busy downtown street. 
</P>
<P>
	A fitness trainer for the rival World Gym ran a low impact  
aerobics session at the sidewalk protest, leading hefty 
participants through a rigorous high-kneed, arm-pumping routine. 
</P>
<P>
	Marilyn Wann organized the event and is the author of  
``Fat!So?,'' a book that seeks strip away the common cultural 
notion that fat is bad. Wann said the 24 Hour Fitness ad is not 
funny and took her ``fat rebels'' to the front lines to be seen and 
heard. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got an epidemic of eating disorders, an epidemic of  
exercise disorders, people who have to work out twice a day or 
they're not worthy human beings,'' Ms. Wann said. ``It really makes 
me sad to think the fitness isn't about health, they're just about 
looks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wann said she'd like to see the company retract the ads and work  
with advocates to fill out its membership. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlsbad-based 24 Hour Fitness has 284 gyms in 10 western  
states, Europe and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	As a row of lithe, Lycra-clad gym members streamed out the  
club's doors past protesters, most agreed the ad was an unusually 
demeaning stab at potential customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ad is very derogatory. The ad is abusive. The ad is  
prejudicial,'' said club member Nancy Cook, who heard about protest 
on television and joined in a show of support. 
</P>
<P>
	But Heather Mulhall, who left the gym on her mountain bike, said  
the ad was simply ``catty or joking.'' She said the club has many 
plus-sized members -- and some are in better shape than her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will get on the treadmill next to people who weigh a little  
bit more, and they can go twice as long as I can,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Steinbrenner Angry at Strawberry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Spring training hasn't even started and already  
New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner is on the back pages. 
</P>
<P>
	The object of his wrath this time was Darryl Strawberry, who  
missed an autograph show over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``You make a commitment, you have to honor your commitment,''  
Steinbrenner told the New York Daily News. ``He didn't even have 
the courtesy to call Cash (general manager Brian Cashman) and tell 
him. That, I don't have any place for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By Monday night, though, the Boss had calmed down after an  
apology from Strawberry. The two of them, in fact, were on stage 
together at Radio City Music Hall for ESPN's awards show, the 
ESPYs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Darryl called me personally Sunday night and I am very  
satisfied that it was not his intention to miss the event without 
notifying us,'' Steinbrenner said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Darryl thought that Brian Cashman had been told. It was a  
miscommunication, that's all,'' he said. ``Darryl was very sincere 
and very apologetic and he knows how important it is to honor our 
commitments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry and pitcher Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez both  
missed Sunday's autograph session at the Florida State Fair. 
Strawberry was seen in Orlando, Fla., at the Magic's 85-82 win over 
Milwaukee, according to a spectator at the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner singled out the outfielder, who is recovering from  
colon cancer surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, signed to a $2.5 million minor-league contract, will  
join the Yankees at spring training in Tampa, Fla., this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``For what we have done, bent over backwards for Straw, we've  
tried to understand his problems and worked with him,'' 
Steinbrenner said before the apology. ``(The Yankees) guaranteed 
that salary. That's a lot of money, and we didn't have to. We 
pulled for him every bit of the way. It's the last guy I expected 
to have pulled that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner didn't fuss over Hernandez's absence.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not concerned as much about him as Straw,'' Steinbrenner  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Joe Torre, David Cone, David Wells, Chuck Knoblauch,  
Ricky Ledee, Shane Spencer and coach Don Zimmer signed autographs 
Sunday. Coaches Willie Randolph and Chris Chambliss replaced 
Strawberry and Hernandez.

	U.S. Warns Iraq on Threat  
</P>
<P>
	MERIDA, Mexico (AP) -- Top U.S. officials said today America  
would react swiftly if Iraq attacked the Turkish base American 
planes are using to patrol Iraqi skies. ``We would respond ... 
strongly and firmly,'' National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said 
during President Clinton's trip to Mexico. Secretary of State 
Madeleine Albright said the U.S. ``response would be swift and 
sure.'' Iraqi vice president Taha Yassin Ramadan said Iraq will 
attack the Incirlik base if American jets keep patrolling over 
Iraq. U.S. warplanes attacked Iraqi defense sites in northern Iraq 
today, the Defense Department said in Washington. It said the 
planes returned safely to Incirlik. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton At Summit in Mexico  
</P>
<P>
	MERIDA, Mexico (AP) -- President Clinton said America's leaders  
must ``keep our eye on the ball,'' as he plunged today into his 
post-impeachment term with initiatives to encourage Mexico's 
frustrated drug war and expand its market for U.S. exports. ``Our 
courses are converging,'' Clinton told Mexicans in an address. 
Clinton and President Ernesto Zedillo agreed to tighten the 
evaluation of drug-fighting performance on both sides of their 
2,000-mile shared border. In two weeks, Clinton must, in the face 
of unfulfilled extradition promises and dropping drug seizures, 
render a formal evaluation of Mexico's cooperation in fighting 
narcotics. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Optimistic on Presidency  
</P>
<P>
	MERIDA, Mexico (AP) -- President Clinton went to work on  
rebuilding his tarnished presidency today saying ``everything will 
be fine'' if Republicans and Democrats put aside bitter 
differences. Clinton also fueled speculation that his wife, 
Hillary, might run for a U.S. Senate seat from New York. ``She 
would be terrific,'' Clinton said. He quickly added that she has 
not made a decision and that he would enthusiastically support 
whatever she does. Clinton spoke in a brief exchange with reporters 
at talks with Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo.

	Ex-Nixon Aide Ehrlichman Dies  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- John D. Ehrlichman, President Nixon's domestic  
affairs adviser who was imprisoned for 18 months for the Watergate 
conspiracy, has died. He was 73. Ehrlichman died yesterday of 
natural causes at his home in Atlanta. He had suffered from 
diabetes, his son, Tom, said. Ehrlichman resigned from his White 
House post in April 1973. He was convicted two years later for 
obstruction of justice, conspiracy and perjury in the attempted 
cover-up of the burglary of the Democratic National Committee 
offices at the Watergate complex in Washington.

	American Close To Resuming Service  
</P>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- American Airlines officials say they think they  
can resume regular service as early as tomorrow. About 800 of 
American's 9,400 pilots were still listed as sick today, American 
officials said. The airline has canceled only 17 flights scheduled 
for tomorrow. Pilots have been taking themselves off the sick list 
at a rapid rate since a federal judge held the Allied Pilots 
Association and two top board members in contempt and promised 
sizable fines against them. All but 12 or 13 pilots, who face 
possible disciplinary action, would be immediately cleared to fly 
after removing themselves from the list.

	Serbs May Compromise on Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Serbia is willing to make major compromises and  
grant rival ethnic Albanians broad self-rule, but it adamantly 
opposes having NATO troops police a Kosovo agreement, the 
republic's president said today. For the first time since a Kosovo 
peace conference started Feb. 6, Milan Milutinovic indicated Serbs 
were willing to give up most of the demands that have stalled the 
talks -- with the exception of NATO peacekeeping troops. Milutinovic 
said any NATO deployment would ``badly damage our sovereignty'' and 
that NATO bombing raids in the absence of an agreement would amount 
to ``an aggression and a war crime.'' Meanwhile, British military 
vehicles and heavy guns were moved from Germany to Greece for use 
in a possible NATO intervention in Kosovo, the British army said.

	Knicks Beat Pistons  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Grant Hill scored 31 points today, but no one  
else reached double figures for Detroit as the Pistons dropped a

points, Patrick Ewing had 14, Larry Johnson 12 and Charlie Ward 10 
for the Knicks.

	Duke Stays No. 1 in AP Hoops Poll  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Duke (25-1), Connecticut (22-1) and Auburn  
(24-1) held onto the top three spots today in the AP men's college 
basketball poll. Michigan State moved up one spot to fourth. 
Maryland and Kentucky each jumped two places to fifth and sixth.

<HEADLINE> New Orleans Revels in Mardi Gras </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- On the eve of Mardi Gras, the Crescent City  
was nearly in full party mode. 
</P>
<P>
	By Monday, tens of thousands of revelers were already gathered,  
drinking and dancing, bourbon in hand and beads around their necks. 
Parades filled the streets, music filled the air and New Orleans 
resident A.J. Hingle couldn't have been happier. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just getting juiced up for Mardi Gras,'' Hingle said as he  
picked up a 12-ounce beer from a stand near the stage at a 
riverfront park where a band was about to rock. 
</P>
<P>
	George and Brenda Holyfield of Los Angeles were waiting for the  
band, and for a Carnival first -- a formal meeting between the 
make-believe monarchs of the city's most prestigious black and 
white Carnival parade groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Rex, King of Carnival, and King Zulu of the Zulu Social Aid and  
Pleasure Club were meeting as part of a giant open-air music and 
fireworks show heralding Lundi Gras, or Fat Monday, a warm-up for 
the raucous citywide Fat Tuesday street party that precedes Lent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Zulu! It's going to be a big party,'' said Holyfield. ``That's  
what we're looking forward to. It's going to be the wildest thing 
possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Holyfields and Hingle were among several hundred people on  
the riverfront enjoying drinks and food bought from the bank of 
stands, the sun, and the hooting tunes of a nearby riverboat's 
calliope concert. 
</P>
<P>
	The Zulu parade, which opens Mardi Gras, was the biggest draw  
for Holyfield, and Mrs. Holyfield said she was enjoying the food 
more than anything else on the trip. ``Crawfish etouffe, oysters 
and all the fried foods. And the seafood gumbo. Everything's just 
great. I'm enjoying it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hingle said he was just waiting for the band, Bag of Donuts.  
It's one of his favorites on the New Orleans bar circuit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lead singer wore a cheerleader's skirt, a purple shirt with  
football shoulder pads and a jester hat in the Mardi Gras colors of 
purple, green and gold. One guitarist was shirtless, with 
black-streaked whiteface makeup a la Kiss; the other wore a pink 
dress and a construction hard hat. 
</P>
<P>
	They weren't Carnival outfits, though -- that's what they always  
wear, Hingle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Phelan's shirt front was hidden under string upon string of  
beads, most of them the long shiny sort paradegoers screamed and 
pleaded for -- and sometimes bared flesh to win from those passing 
by on floats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen people go as crazy as they do over beads,''  
said Phelan, of Marlboro, N.Y. He was finishing a two-week stay in 
New Orleans on a trip he'd promised himself for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``I passed through here 42 years ago, a week after the Mardi  
Gras. And I always said I'm coming back for the Mardi Gras. I'm 
here.''

<HEADLINE> France Finalizes Aerospace Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- The French finance ministry has finalized the  
details of a proposed merger between the government-controlled 
aerospace company Aerospatiale and Matra Hautes Technologies, a 
unit of privately-owned Lagardere. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministry, in an announcement late Monday, said that a  
planned 20 percent public offering in the merged group would take 
place in the first half of this year, market conditions permitting. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the merger deal, Lagardere will pay the government up to  
two billion francs (about $357 million) for a 33 percent stake in 
the Aerospatiale. The French government will own less than 50 
percent of the new company, but it will still be the largest 
shareholder. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the merger and decline in government ownership  
makes good commercial sense, and may boost the process of European 
defense sector restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are very complementary operations,'' said Antoine Nodet,  
analyst at the Paris brokerage Pinatton. ``The most obvious is in 
missiles, but they are a good match in other activities as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	European aerospace restructuring is expected to continue.  
</P>
<P>
	Germany's DaimlerChrysler Aerospace AG and France's Thomson-CSF  
are seen as the next likely movers after British Aerospace PLC's 
takeover earlier this year of General Electric PLC's Marconi 
division.

<HEADLINE> Washington Avalanche Leaves 1 Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELLINGHAM, Wash. (AP) -- One snowboarder is dead, a second is  
missing and two others narrowly escaped injury after being caught 
in a massive avalanche on Mount Baker. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of Justin M. Parker, 19, was found Sunday beneath about  
10 feet of snow. A search for Sean Riches, 25, was suspended until 
the avalanche danger subsides. 
</P>
<P>
	``The avalanche ... is just a small amount of what's ready to  
fall,'' said Ron Peterson, Whatcom County's search and rescue 
supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
	The slide came down about 12:30 p.m. Sunday and covered an area  
about a mile long, 100 feet wide and 12 feet deep in Rumble Gully, 
just outside the Mount Baker Ski Area, about 90 miles northeast of 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Freymeyer, operators leader for Bellingham Mountain Rescue,  
said the avalanche was the largest he had seen on the 10,778-foot 
peak. 
</P>
<P>
	Two skiers or snowboarders whose names were not available  
managed to free themselves after being caught in the slide, 
Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still missing in Rumble Gully is Jason Edward Carey Fuller, 25,  
a snowboarder who vanished in an avalanche in mid-January. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, five people were killed in avalanches in  
California, Colorado and Utah.

<HEADLINE> Raiders Sign QB Rich Gannon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALAMEDA, Calif. (AP) -- Finally, journeyman quarterback Rich  
Gannon is getting his chance as a full-time starter and the Oakland 
Raiders, souring on Jeff George, are giving it to him. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11-year backup and spot starter was signed Monday by the  
Raiders, reportedly to a four-year, $16 million contract in a 
free-agent deal that also signaled the end of George's 
disappointing two-season stay in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been an uphill battle for me but it's made me a better  
football player,'' Gannon said in a conference call. ``This is the 
first time I've entered the season as a starter, but my approach 
isn't going to change at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always prepared each week so I really don't think it's going  
to make that much difference. Certainly, I feel I can handle the 
job and I think it's going to be rewarding in the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other moves, the Raiders also announced the re-signing of  
backup quarterback Wade Wilson and the signing of receiver Chris T. 
Jones, who had 70 catches for 859 yards for Philadelphia in 1996 
before hurting his knee. He was limited to four games in 1997 and 
was out of football last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Raiders coach Jon Gruden announced the signings but declined to  
go into detail about the team's decision to go with Gannon over 
George. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to compare two players,'' Gruden said. ``This is  
all about Rich Gannon. He can make all the throws. He can throw the 
ball deep, short, intermediate. He can scramble. He has great 
knowledge of the AFC West. He has been a big part of Kansas City's 
solid offensive play the last few years and he's a great leader.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Raiders let George go over the weekend, declining to pay a  
$5 million option, a move that voided the final three years of his 
contract and made him a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	George had hoped to stay with the Raiders and offered to  
renegotiate his contract but Gruden called him Saturday and told 
him the team was going in a different direction. George was said to 
be surprised, even devastated by the news. 
</P>
<P>
	``We assumed there would be good faith negotiations following  
the voiding of the contract (Friday),'' said George's agent, Leigh 
Steinberg. ``All I'll say is there wasn't any.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Raiders went 4-12 with George as a starter in 1997 but a  
groin injury allowed him to play in just eight games and finish 
four last year, when the the team was 8-8. 
</P>
<P>
	While George helped revive the Raiders' deep passing game, he  
was also hurt by a lack of mobility that contributed to his being 
sacked 80 times while with Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	George also alienated Gruden and teammates alike when he went on  
his radio show with a month remaining in the season and declared 
himself out for the year. He hadn't bothered to check with anyone 
in the organization, including the team doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	George actually came back to play -- and played well -- in the  
season finale but the damage was done. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he doesn't have George's arm, Gannon seems a better fit  
with Gruden's West Coast-type system because he can throw on the 
move and is used to going through a progression of reads. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a good scrambler. He can avoid the initial rush and he  
makes great decisions,'' Gruden said. ``I think he rallies his 
teammates. He just has a lot of all-around skills and he's bring 
them here to Oakland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gannon, 33, built a 31-27 record as a starter and was especially  
impressive in the last two years, when he won 10 of 16 starts for 
the Chiefs while in relief of injured Elvis Grbac. 
</P>
<P>
	Gannon earned $700,000 last season but also had made it known to  
the Chiefs that he at least wanted a chance to compete with Grbac 
for the starting job. 
</P>
<P>
	However, new Chiefs coach Gunther Cunningham recently endorsed  
Grbac as his starter, eliminating the possibility Gannon would 
return to Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	With Oakland, Gannon believes he can follow the lead of other  
so-called journeyman quarterbacks who found their greatest success 
later in their careers such as Atlanta's Chris Chandler, Buffalo's 
Doug Flutie and Minnesota's Randall Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think one thing in common with all those guys is that they  
are competitors,'' Gannon said. ``They had some tough times but 
they believed in themselves and never gave up. I look at myself in 
the same light.''

<HEADLINE> Kerry Collins' DWI Case Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- A postponement was granted today in the  
drunken-driving case of former Carolina Panthers quarterback Kerry 
Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins was scheduled to appear in Mecklenburg County District  
Court this morning, but Judge Fritz Y. Mercer Jr. granted a 
continuance. No reason was given and no new court date was 
immediately set. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, 26, was arrested early on the morning of Nov. 2 after  
police said the car he was driving crossed the center line of a 
downtown Charlotte street. 
</P>
<P>
	His arrest came about nine hours after his new team, the New  
Orleans Saints, lost to the Panthers. Collins was the target of 
repeated taunts from fans throughout the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, the Panthers' first-ever draft pick in 1995, was cut  
last October after reportedly saying his heart was no longer into 
being Carolina's quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans picked him up after his release by Carolina, but the  
Saints said last week that they were not interested in re-signing 
the free agent.

<HEADLINE> Oregon Ship Wreckage May Be Sunk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOS BAY, Ore. (AP) -- Crews took another shot Monday at igniting  
the oil left on a grounded tanker while officials announced a plan 
to tow the bow section of the wreckage out to sea and sink it in 
deep water. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the 400,000 gallons of oil on the ship was burned off  
last week, and officials say no more than 10 percent is left. The 
residual oil has transformed into a thicker, waxier substance that 
is harder to burn. 
</P>
<P>
	The fuel pouring from the two halves of the New Carissa, which  
grounded nearly two weeks ago, was washing up on a nearby beach, 
where 300 cleanup workers were scraping it up, Coast Guard 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the environmental toll grew, with 37 dead birds found  
so far and oyster harvests ordered halted. Shellfish samples were 
being analyzed for contamination. 
</P>
<P>
	The tentative plan calls for refloating the larger bow section,  
towing it 200 miles out to sea where depths exceed 9,000 feet and 
sinking it, said Tom Berglund, a spokesman from the joint 
information center.

<HEADLINE> Toughest U.S. Sheriff Under Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- He houses prisoners in sweltering tents, feeds  
them green bologna sandwiches and dresses them in pink underwear. 
</P>
<P>
	He bans coffee, skin magazines and R-rated movies, and  
dispatches chain gangs in old-style striped uniforms to cut weeds 
and paint curbs. 
</P>
<P>
	A hard-line approach to crime has won Maricopa County Sheriff  
Joe Arpaio accolades as ``America's toughest sheriff,'' a title 
bestowed by a tabloid magazine after his 1992 election. The public 
loves him: polls frequently rate Arpaio as Arizona's most popular 
lawman. 
</P>
<P>
	But now Arpaio is being accused of running a jail that's too  
tough. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI and the county attorney's office are investigating  
whether detention officers crossed the line when they subdued an 
inmate, killed him and then allegedly tried to cover it up. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 7, the county and its insurance carrier paid $8.25  
million to settle a wrongful-death lawsuit filed by Scott Norberg's 
family. They allege Arpaio's officers suffocated Norberg in 1996 
and that the medical examiner's office covered up evidence of a 
beating when it ruled the death accidental. 
</P>
<P>
	Arpaio called the insurance company ``gutless.''  
</P>
<P>
	``We were looking to go to trial and tell the true story,'' said  
Arpaio, who contends Norberg caused his own death during a violent, 
drug-induced psychosis. 
</P>
<P>
	Arpaio's jailers have been accused before of brutalizing  
prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Justice Department spent two years investigating  
alleged inmate abuse and civil-rights violations in the county jail 
system, the nation's fourth largest. 
</P>
<P>
	The case ended last year with a settlement between Arpaio and  
the U.S. Attorney's Office after the government was satisfied the 
sheriff had taken steps to prevent excessive force against inmates. 
</P>
<P>
	Arpaio said he runs harsh but humane jails that treat their  
6,800 inmates fairly and save taxpayers millions of dollars by 
serving up bologna and ostrich meat for just pennies a meal. 
</P>
<P>
	The vast majority of his officers are dedicated and  
professional, said Arpaio, adding that he fired three jailers who 
were caught on videotape beating an inmate. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people think we are out of control, that's garbage,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Norberg case has given new ammunition to groups  
like Amnesty International which decries Arpaio's jails as 
inhumane. 
</P>
<P>
	An internal investigation concluded that detention officers were  
justified in handcuffing Norberg, zapping him repeatedly with a 
stun gun, gagging him with a towel and shoving his head into his 
chest. 
</P>
<P>
	The medical examiner's office said Norberg, 35, arrested for  
assaulting a police officer, died accidentally from ``positional 
asphyxia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In pretrial depositions, however, some of Arpaio's employees and  
inmate eyewitnesses said the half-dozen detention officers who 
scuffled with Norberg used excessive force. 
</P>
<P>
	Norberg was dazed and confused when officers went to his cell to  
serve him with court papers, and a scuffle ensued, witnesses said. 
Grainy videotape from a jail camera captured officers dragging 
Norberg down a hallway to a black metal restraint chair. 
</P>
<P>
	Detention officer Kimberly Walsh, who held the towel clamped  
over Norberg's mouth, testified she told two fellow officers that 
Norberg wasn't breathing. According to Walsh, the officers didn't 
care. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh and another officer were unable to revive Norberg.  
</P>
<P>
	Arpaio, who spent 25 years as a federal narcotics agent, claims  
the FBI and county criminal investigations are politically 
motivated, the result of his long feud with County Attorney Rick 
Romley over jail funding and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Romley spokesman Bill FitzGerald said bad blood wasn't an issue.  
</P>
<P>
	Former Attorney General Grant Woods, who lauds Arpaio's  
get-tough approach to criminals, says the Norberg case nonetheless 
raises legitimate questions about how the sheriff runs his jails. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure most people are hopeful that steps will be taken so  
this doesn't happen again. You can be tough on prisoners and not 
violate their basic rights,'' Woods said. ``That's what the public 
expects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the spate of bad publicity, politicians and celebrities  
still clamor to appear at the sheriff's side. Gov. Jane Hull, 
syndicated columnist Ken Hamblen, singer Merle Haggard and 
``Politically Incorrect'' host Bill Mahr roasted the sheriff at a 
recent charity dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	Arpaio gleefully recalls the reception he got during last  
month's Fiesta Bowl parade in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone was cheering, cheering, cheering. I don't get maybe  
four boos out of 400,000 people,'' he said. ``They still like me.''

<HEADLINE> Rockets Look To Mend on the Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The Houston Rockets are ailing and they must deal  
with it on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Barkley and Antoine Carr are recovering from knee  
surgery Matt Maloney has a slight shoulder separation and last 
year's No. 1 draft pick, Rodrick Rhodes, has yet to play because of 
a torn tendon in his chest. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the players will return soon.  
</P>
<P>
	To make matters worse, after Tuesday night's home game against  
the Phoenix Suns, the Rockets play seven times in 10 days, 
including four straight on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't imagine seven games in 10 nights,'' center Hakeem  
Olajuwon said. ``We have to worry about the game we're playing. We 
have to break it down in a simpler plan. This will force us to 
build our chemistry. We have no choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starting with the Suns, the Rockets play three games in three  
nights. They've won four games in a row since a season-opening loss 
to the Los Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley was a major contributor to the Rockets' 4-1 record,  
leading the team in scoring at 19.2 points per game. His average of 
17 rebounds leads the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``Charles has been our security blanket,'' coach Rudy  
Tomjanovich said. ``We run a lot of plays through him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley was at practice Monday less than 24 hours after  
undergoing surgery to repair torn cartilage in his left knee. He 
expects to return in 3-4 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to the games unless they force me, I can't  
afford any more fines,'' Barkley said. ``It's just so frustrating 
not to be able to do anything. I have great confidence in this 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Othella Harrington, averaging 11 points in only 19.6 minutes per  
game, will start in place of Barkley at forward. He is the team's 
fourth-leading rebounder, averaging 5.2. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've just got to be careful with my fouls and just play  
hard,'' Harrington said. ``Even when I know Charles is starting, 
I'm always ready to play at the beginning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tomjanovich plans to start Harrington, then rest him in the  
first quarter and bring him back when Olajuwon needs rest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want both inside players out at the same time,''  
Tomjanovich said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley reported to training camp in excellent shape after  
working with a personal trainer to overcome the effects of 
off-season elbow and two hernia surgeries. 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley's streak of five 15-plus rebounding games to start the  
season tied for second on the all-time list with Dave Cowens and 
Kermit Washington. Wilt Chamberlain started the 1970 season with 11 
15-plus rebound games. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrington isn't expected to duplicate Barkley's numbers, but  
Tomjanovich won't automatically put the offensive burden on Scottie 
Pippen. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a versatile team,'' Tomjanovich said. ``We can throw a  
lot of offensive combinations out there from the outside more than 
inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley's injury has been the most notable, but it's just the  
latest in a series for Houston. Carr was supposed to back up 
Olajuwon but has watched from the sideline while recovering from 
his knee operation, forcing the Rockets to sign Stanley Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomjanovich is treating the road trip as a challenge.  
</P>
<P>
	``A road trip when you are healthy is a great place to bring  
your team together,'' Tomjanovich said. ``That's a big part of 
getting a winning team together, when you do it on the road and you 
do it together.''

<HEADLINE> 'Misanthrope' Misses the Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Posturing and preening are the watch words of  
the Classic Stage Company's relentless revival of ``The 
Misanthrope,'' currently running off-Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
	This acrid adaptation by English playwright Martin Crimp teems  
with trendiness yet drains all the life and the laughs out of one 
of Moliere's most glorious comedies. 
</P>
<P>
	Transposed from 17th century France to present-day London, the  
production has earned an inordinate amount of attention because of 
film actress Uma Thurman, who here plays an American movie star 
named Jennifer. 
</P>
<P>
	The lovely, blond Thurman of ``Pulp Fiction'' fame holds her own  
with such accomplished classically trained actors as Roger Rees and 
Mary Lou Rosato. But Thurman and the rest of the company are faced 
with the law of diminishing returns as they deal with Crimp's 
stilted, sour script. 
</P>
<P>
	Rees is Alceste, the title character, an embittered playwright  
who hungers for the young movie star while trashing his colleagues 
and just about everyone else who gets in his sightlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Rees, Broadway's original Nicholas Nickleby, rants and raves  
with astonishing virtuosity. Not many actors can make combativeness 
attractive, but Rees does, although his highwire bickering has 
nowhere to go. 
</P>
<P>
	Alceste is cautioned in his excesses by good friend John, played  
by the fine Michael Emerson, best known for portraying Oscar Wilde 
in ``Gross Indecency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dialogue is sprinkled with an occasional four-letter word  
and references to such contemporary folk as playwrights David Hare 
and Alan Ayckbourn, composer Andrew Lloyd Webber and media empress 
Tina Brown. The name-droppings sound too clever by half. 
</P>
<P>
	At least designer Narelle Sissons' oddly angled set is fun. It  
suggests a hotel room gone wildly out of control with a mirrored 
backdrop that has the audience appearing as part of the production 
-- and listening conspiratorially to all the gossipy goings-on. 
</P>
<P>
	Director Barry Edelstein has staged this ruckus with precision.  
Clarity is a virtue that can't be overestimated, but in the end, 
this ``Misanthrope'' is as unfunny as it is unpleasant.

<HEADLINE> Threat of Avalanches Delays Search </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELLINGHAM, Wash. (AP) -- Avalanche danger Monday kept search  
parties from looking for a young man who vanished in an earlier 
slide that took the life of a snowboarder. 
</P>
<P>
	The mile-long avalanche buried a stretch of Mount Baker in snow  
and debris up to 20 feet deep. The body of snowboarder Justin M. 
Parker, 19, of Parkland, was recovered Sunday, but then search 
efforts were suspended because of extreme avalanche danger. 
</P>
<P>
	Sean Riches, 25, of London, Ontario, believed to be a skier, was  
still missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Signs and a rope line warn those venturing into the Rumble Gully  
area, just outside the Mount Baker Ski Area, about 90 miles 
northeast of Seattle. But no avalanche-control work is allowed or 
done in the area, ski area spokeswoman Gwyn Howat said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The sign informs hikers, snowboarders and skiers that there will  
be a $500 minimum fine for any rescue effort, and notes that such 
efforts may not be possible. 
</P>
<P>
	The slide was estimated to be moving ``close to 200 miles per  
hour,'' and took seconds to bury the entire slope, Howat said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 feet of snow had fallen in the area over the past 12  
days, so going outside the maintained ski area was like ``playing 
Russian roulette,'' Whatcom County Deputy Ron Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Freymeyer, operations leader for Bellingham Mountain  
Rescue, said the avalanche was the largest he had seen on the 
10,778-foot peak. 
</P>
<P>
	More snow is expected in the next few days -- topping off 690  
inches of snowfall so far this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Still missing in Rumble Gully is Jason Edward Carey Fuller, 25,  
of Bellingham, a snowboarder who vanished in a mid-January 
avalanche.

<HEADLINE> Costner's 'Message' Tops Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Kevin Costner's romantic drama ``Message in a  
Bottle'' edged out the revenge film ``Payback'' at the weekend box 
office while new family fare also did well, according to industry 
estimates Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Message in a Bottle'' opened with $19.1 million in ticket  
sales from Friday through Monday, knocking the Mel Gibson action 
piece into second place in its second week with $18.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Timed for Valentine's Day, ``Message'' stars Costner as a boat  
builder whose bottled notes to his dead wife win the heart of a new 
love, played by Robin Wright Penn. It was among three new films for 
the Presidents Day weekend as the year's box office began to heat 
up following the usual slow start. 
</P>
<P>
	``My Favorite Martian,'' based on the 1960s TV sitcom, debuted  
in third place with $11.1 million, while ``Blast from the Past'' 
opened at No. 5 with $9.7 million, according to Exhibitor Relations 
Co. ``Blast'' stars Brendan Fraser as a man who grows up in a bomb 
shelter and emerges into modern-day Los Angeles, where he meets 
Alicia Silverstone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Martian'' benefited from timing and nostalgia, said Chuck  
Viane, general sales manager for Buena Vista Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	``There hadn't been a new family film since Christmas,'' he  
said. ``The market was open and ready for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare in Love,'' moving into wider release, benefited  
from strong word of mouth and the 13 Oscar nominations it garnered 
last week. It was in sixth place with $9.5 million over four days 
after adding more than 1,000 screens. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life is Beautiful,'' which is up for best picture, was not in  
the top 10, but both it and ``Shakespeare'' saw strong jumps in 
their per-screen averages, meaning they generally drew larger 
audiences to each showing. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, the reissued ``Saving Private Ryan,'' which had  
11 nominations, only held its own. The acclaimed war film was in 
seventh place with $4 million for four days. ``The Thin Red Line,'' 
with seven nominations, finished out of the Top 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Teen films that were supreme a few weeks ago saw their audiences  
dip in the wake of the new fare. ``She's All That'' fell from 
second to fourth place with $10.2 million while ``Varsity Blues'' 
plummeted to No. 10 with $3.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Simply Irresistible,'' starring Sarah Michelle Gellar of  
television's ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' tanked after a 
disappointing opening. It fell from the top 10 list after just two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``A Civil Action,'' ``Stepmom'' and ``You've Got Mail'' also  
left the list. 
</P>
<P>
	Another limited release, the quirky comedy ``Rushmore,'' added  
several hundred theaters in its second week and came in at No. 8 
with $3.7 million. Buena Vista planned to expand the movie yet 
again this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patch Adams'' fell from third to ninth place with $3.6  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, it was a slower Presidents Day holiday for movies than  
last year, when ``Titanic'' was sinking box office records. The top 
12 films took in $97.7 million, down 14.8 percent from the previous 
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are estimated grosses at North American theaters for Friday  
through Monday. Final figures were expected Tuesday: 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Message in a Bottle,'' $19.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Payback,'' $18.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``My Favorite Martian,'' $11.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``She's All That,'' $10.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``Blast from the Past,'' $9.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``Shakespeare in Love,'' $9.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``Saving Private Ryan,'' $4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``Rushmore,'' $3.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``Patch Adams,'' $3.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``Varsity Blues,'' $3.4 million.

<HEADLINE> Study: Neanderthals Couldn't Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- California researchers are challenging a study  
that raised the possibility that Neanderthals could talk. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke University scientists reported in April that a bony canal  
in the skulls of Neanderthals indicates they may have had the nerve 
complex needed to control the subtle and varied movement of the 
tongue required for speech. 
</P>
<P>
	A paper appearing in Tuesday's Proceedings of the National  
Academy of Sciences questions that finding. 
</P>
<P>
	``The size of the hypoglossal canal is not a reliable indicator  
of speech. Therefore the timing of the origin of human language and 
the speech capabilities of Neanderthals remain open questions,'' 
said the team headed by David DeGusta of the University of 
California at Berkeley. responded Richard F. Kay, one of the Duke 
researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard F. Kay, one of the Duke researchers, responded,  
``They've got an interesting point of view and it's stirring the 
pot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If their argument is taken at its face value, we couldn't say  
humans have evolved toward having an increased brain size over the 
last million years,'' he said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The two studies have some similar findings but differ sharply in  
their conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Duke study speculated that Neanderthals might have been able  
to talk, based on findings that the average size of their 
hypoglossal canal was similar to that of modern humans. 
</P>
<P>
	The canal, carrying the nerve that directs the tongue, is  
smaller in apes, which are incapable of complex speech, the Duke 
study found. 
</P>
<P>
	Neanderthals, named for the Neander valley in Germany where  
their remains were first found, evolved around 300,000 years ago. 
If they could talk, it would indicate speech evolved significantly 
earlier than has been thought. Researchers have long believed that 
the ability to make modern human speech sounds did not develop 
until about 40,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	While modern humans came along after the Neanderthal, some may  
have lived at the same time and place as the final generations of 
those early people. 
</P>
<P>
	DeGusta said his Berkeley group tested 30 nonhuman primates,  
compared to just two in the Duke study, and found 15 of them had 
hypoglossal canal sizes larger than humans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because nonhuman primates are not known to speak, their  
hypoglossal canals should be smaller than those in modern humans,'' 
the researchers said. But ``many nonhuman primate specimens have 
hypoglossal canal areas that fall within the range of our modern 
human sample.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The average gibbon's canal is twice as large as a modern  
human's ...'' DeGusta said in a telephone interview, ``so we 
suggest you cannot use canal size'' to indicate the ability to 
speak. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed the Berkeley paper notes that some very ancient hominids  
had average canal sizes close to humans. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the criteria of the Duke study, ``modern human  
speech capabilities originated at least 3.2 million years ago in 
Australopithecus afarensis, a species not previously noted for 
(brain development), symbolic capacity or even stone tool making,'' 
they said. Australopithecus afarensis is the family of the famous 
African fossil Lucy. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Berkeley researchers concentrated on the range of  
canal measurements rather than their average, concluding that ``an 
individual's ability to speak can depend only on its own canal 
size, not the mean size for its species.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kay defended his group's use of average size by comparing  
studies of brain size in ancient and modern species. 
</P>
<P>
	Modern humans have a brain capacity of about 1,250 cubic  
centimeters, he said, though in some individuals it is as small as 
800 cc. By comparison the extinct species Homo erectus a million 
years ago averaged about 800 cc, with some larger. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can say something from this average,'' Kay said. The  
Berkeley researchers contention that you cannot draw conclusions 
from averages means we ``couldn't say humans have evolved toward 
having an increased brain size over the last million years,'' he 
added.

<HEADLINE> Kessem Power Wins San Luis Obispo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Kessem Power, ridden by substitute jockey  
Gary Stevens, overtook 8-5 favorite Brave Act in the late going to 
win Monday's $200,000 San Luis Obispo Handicap at Santa Anita by 
three-quarters of a length. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens got the mount on Kessem Power, a 7-year-old New  
Zealand-bred son of Kessem, after Eddie Delahoussaye phoned in 
sick. 
</P>
<P>
	Kessem Power, who carried 115 pounds, covered 1 1/2 miles on turf  
in 2:28 and, as the fourth-favorite in a field of seven, paid 
$12.40, $4.80 and $2.80. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's just push-button, and he's a smart horse who just flies  
home the last quarter,'' Stevens said of Kessem Power, who won for 
the 11th time in 35 starts and earned $120,000 to raise his career 
earnings to $543,624. 
</P>
<P>
	Brave Act, ridden by Goncalino Almeida and carrying high weight  
of 121 pounds, crossed the finish line 1 3/4 lengths in front of Lazy 
Lode and returned $3.20 and $2.40. 
</P>
<P>
	Brave Act won his previous four stakes races including the San  
Gabriel and San Marcos handicaps at the current Santa Anita 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Lazy Lode, the 2-1 second-favorite ridden by Corey Nakatani and  
carrying 120 pounds, was 4 1/2 lengths ahead of River Bay at the wire 
and paid $2.60 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Following River Bay across the finish line in the 43rd running  
of the race for 4-year-olds and up were Southerly Wind, Native 
Desert and Pompeyo.

<HEADLINE> Nobel Prize Winning Scientist Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WAKULLA SPRINGS, Fla. (AP) -- Henry W. Kendall, a winner of the  
1990 Nobel Prize for physics, died Monday during an underwater 
photography dive, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology,  
was working with a National Geographic magazine mapping team at 
Wakulla Springs state park when his body was found in shallow 
water, Wakulla County Sheriff's Capt. Gene McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators had not yet determined whether Kendall died of a  
heart attack or encountered a problem in the water and drowned. 
There was air left in his tank, McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall, along with Jerome I. Friedman and Richard E. Taylor,  
worked for years proving the existence of quarks, now thought to be 
the basic building block of matter. They all shared the Nobel prize 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarthy said Kendall, 72, was taking underwater photographs by  
himself in about eight to 10 feet of water Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	A diver who encountered Kendall about 4:30 p.m. said everything  
seemed fine, McCarthy said. At 5 p.m., another diver found him on 
the bottom of the springs. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall was flown to Tallahassee Memorial Regional Medical  
Center, where he was pronounced dead, nursing supervisor Kathy 
Andrews said. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy was planned for Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Kendall received a Ph.D. in nuclear and atomic physics from MIT  
in 1954. He taught at Stanford University from 1956 to 1961, when 
he took a teaching spot at MIT. 
</P>
<P>
	A Boston native, Kendall was a founding member of the Union of  
Concerned Scientists in 1969. He had served as that organization's 
chairman since 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	Wakulla Springs is 13 miles south of Tallahassee.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico's state-owned oil monopoly Petroleos  
Mexicanos said Monday it had awarded a $1.2 billion contract to a 
consortium to revamp a refinery in the Gulf Coast port of Ciudad 
Madero. 
</P>
<P>
	The consortium led by Mexican construction company Grupo Tribasa  
SA includes Korea's Sunkyong Group and Germany's Siemens AG. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1.2 billion project will allow the state oil monopoly, also  
known as Pemex, to refine an additional 112,000 barrels a day of 
heavy Maya crude, said Jaime Willars, director of its refining 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Pemex said the modernization and remodeling of the refinery at

<HEADLINE> Scientists Re-Assess 1918 Killer Flu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The 1918 flu that killed more than 20 million  
people may have quietly percolated for several years, maybe even 
trading back and forth between pigs and people, until suddenly 
growing strong enough to become the world's worst pandemic. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the latest theory from the Armed Forces Institute of  
Pathology, which reported Monday that researchers for the first 
time have completely analyzed a critical gene from the killer 
influenza virus. 
</P>
<P>
	The gene likely ``was adapting in humans or in swine for maybe  
several years before it broke out as a pandemic virus,'' said 
molecular biologist Ann Reid, lead author of the study published in 
the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``we can't tell whether it went from pigs into humans or  
from humans into pigs,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Different influenza strains circle the globe annually. Usually,  
they're fairly similar to viruses people have caught in the past. 
Every so often a strain tough enough to kill millions emerges, and 
experts warn that the world is overdue for another pandemic. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why understanding the 1918 flu's genes are important.  
Scientists need to know what made that strain the deadliest ever -- 
and why it struck down mostly young, healthy people -- to better 
react if similar killer flu emerges again. 
</P>
<P>
	Most experts believe that genetically stable flu viruses reside  
harmlessly in birds, but that occasionally one of these bird 
viruses infects pigs. The swine immune system attacks the virus, 
forcing it to change genetically to survive. If it then spreads to 
humans, the result can be devastating. 
</P>
<P>
	In two other pandemics -- the 1957 Asian flu and 1968 Hong Kong  
flu -- viruses apparently made a fast jump from birds to pigs to 
humans. That's because human flu genes from those pandemics appear 
very similar to avian flu genes. 
</P>
<P>
	But the new study finds no similarity between those bird genes  
and a key gene in the 1918 flu. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid studied lung tissue preserved from autopsies of two  
soldiers who died from influenza, at Ft. Jackson, S.C., and Camp 
Upton, N.Y., and from the frozen corpse of an Alaskan woman. Reid 
fully mapped the hemagglutinin gene, which is key to influenza 
infection taking hold. 
</P>
<P>
	She discovered that the hemagglutinin closely resembles mammal  
genes. 
</P>
<P>
	So instead of making that fast bird-pigs-people jump that  
scientists expect in a pandemic, the 1918 virus apparently evolved 
in mammals -- either pigs or humans -- over many years before 
suddenly mutating into a mass killer. It may have percolated in 
humans as early as 1900, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Reid can't tell if pigs developed the mutation that turned  
the virus into a killer and gave it to people -- or if people gave 
it to pigs. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the evidence: A huge wave of mild influenza struck people  
during the spring of 1918, but no pigs were sick. Then the flu 
struck again in the fall. This time it suddenly killed millions of 
people, and this time pigs were sick, too -- but people who had had 
the mild spring flu were reported to be immune. 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless of which species evolved the killer strain, the long  
incubation period has implications for predicting future flu 
outbreaks. ``We may have to expand our concept of where pandemics 
come from,'' Reid said. 
</P>
<P>
	Institute scientists are analyzing other genes from the 1918  
virus, but Reid said the mystery so far is getting deeper. ``The 
more you study it, the more perplexing it becomes.''

<HEADLINE> Pooches Profitable in Ski Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OXFORD, Maine (AP) -- Cross-country ski center operators who once  
shooed away canine companions are now pursuing customers who take 
their four-legged friends along on romps in the woods. 
</P>
<P>
	The result is more and more groomed trails dedicated to dog  
owners. They're known in the business as ``loop de poop'' trails. 
</P>
<P>
	The owner of the Carter's Cross Country Ski Centers allows dogs  
on all of his trails with one caveat: owners pay full price for a 
daily doggie pass that will be confiscated for any misbehavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've never had a problem,'' said David Carter, who lets dogs  
romp alongside their owners on 22 miles of trails in Oxford, about 
35 miles northwest of Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a growing doggie-friendly trend at cross-country ski  
centers. 
</P>
<P>
	Dogs were allowed at only a handful of trails a decade ago. Now  
they're allowed at 53 of 212 areas that belong to the Cross Country 
Ski Areas Association, according to Chris Frado, president and 
executive director of the Winchester, N.H.-based organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason is simple: For sheer exuberance, it's hard to beat  
the reaction of a dog crunching around in fresh, fluffy snow. So 
it's only natural that skiers want to let their dogs tag along. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Bourque of Portland said his dog Susi, a Labrador  
retriever, is 9 years old and gray around the muzzle. ``But when 
she's in the snow, she runs like a puppy. It's exhilarating,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wende Gray of the Maine Nordic Ski Council said the organization  
gets lots of calls from dog owners, many of them European 
transplants who are used to having their dogs accompany them 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``We recognize that there are thousands of people who don't go  
the ski areas because they can't bring Fido with them,'' Frado 
said. ``Instead of saying no to a group of users, we're learning to 
say yes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most common method is for ski areas to set aside a portion  
of their trail system, or a single trail loop, for dog owners. 
Leashes are required until the pooches reach the designated trails. 
</P>
<P>
	Segregation is important because dogs can punch holes in the  
snow with their paws, wrecking the tracks in which skiers glide or 
the groomed surface on which they plow. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, there is the obvious problem of waste on the trail, thus  
the tongue-in-cheek names, like ``poop loop'' and ``loop de poop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ski centers that allow dogs have come up with solutions,  
such as providing plastic bags or pooper-scoopers. Many also bar 
dogs on days when weather conditions make the snow particularly 
susceptible to damage from romping dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	In Oxford, Carter welcomes dogs on most days as long as their  
owners are willing to pay $10 for the privilege. He estimates his 
decision to accommodate dogs three years ago has boosted his 
business by 5 to 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Mainers point to Gene Dayton as a pioneer. His dog trail  
called the ``Loop de Poop'' opened 10 years ago in Frisco, Colo. 
It's a modest 1.5 miles, but the idea -- and the name -- caught on. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the most extensive doggie ski programs is at North Valley  
Trails in Sun Valley, Idaho, where half of the 95 miles of trails 
are open to canines, said Mary Austin Crofts, executive director of 
the Blaine County Recreation District. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, North Valley Trails sold nearly 1,000 season tickets  
for dogs and 3,500 season tickets for people, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes a lot of sense to do what customers want you to do,''  
said Crofts. ``That's the American way.''

<HEADLINE> Losing Streak Stuns Cincinnati </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- For the first 15 games, Cincinnati remained  
perfect, coach Bob Huggins remained comparatively calm and Bearcats 
fans started ruminating about a Final Four appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last 10 days, it has all changed.  
</P>
<P>
	The once-lofty Bearcats have lost their cool, their intensity  
and three consecutive games against nondescript teams, leaving them 
in an unusual predicament for a Huggins team. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-game losing streak matches Cincinnati's longest during  
Huggins' 10 seasons -- he's had only three other slumps as long -- 
and will end up costing it in at tournament time. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati, ranked No. 3 for much of the season, fell to No. 9  
in the poll released Monday. The Bearcats (21-4) are no longer in 
first place in their Conference USA division and figure they've 
wasted the chance for a top seed in the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten days ago, it was unimaginable. Now it's unexplainable.  
</P>
<P>
	``For some reason, we've lost our focus,'' point guard Michael  
Horton said before practice Monday. ``I don't know what it is. This 
needs to stop somewhere. We need to get a little confidence back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They were full of confidence during the 15-0 start that included  
wins over Duke -- they remain the only team to beat them -- as well 
as Minnesota, Louisville and Rhode Island when they were ranked. 
</P>
<P>
	They had depth and seemed to make all the right moves. The  
volatile Huggins was a lot calmer on the sidelines and the Bearcats 
pulled out one close game after another. 
</P>
<P>
	The ominous signs -- close wins against overmatched Dayton and  
Southern Mississippi -- were ignored. A 62-60 loss at UNC Charlotte 
was shrugged off to a bad call. 
</P>
<P>
	So was a 61-60 overtime loss at DePaul, even though Cincinnati  
blew a lead and was fortunate to get the game to overtime. The 
officials couldn't be blamed for a 62-58 loss at Marquette four 
days later. 
</P>
<P>
	The crushing loss came Sunday in St. Louis, where technical  
fouls on Huggins and Melvin Levett helped the Billikens pull away 
to a 69-57 victory -- the Bearcats' most lopsided loss in 52 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Huggins' technical foul for jumping in the air and screaming  
about a non-call allowed Saint Louis to cut the score to 48-47 with 
6:53 left. Levett's technical for upending Troy Robertson on a 
rebound attempt helped the Billikens push their lead to nine points 
with fewer than two minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
	Huggins defended his own outburst on Monday, saying it didn't  
hurt the team. He also complained that center Kenyon Martin is 
getting fouled but the officials are letting it go. 
</P>
<P>
	``How much am I supposed to sit there and take?'' Huggins said.  
``Really, I thought I was pretty good (until then). At a certain 
point in time, you've got to fight for your team. 
</P>
<P>
	``All this stuff about mellowing out and (being) nicer and all  
that stuff -- I don't know. But I don't think that hurt the team. 
Throwing the ball away hurt the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The refs have been making terrible calls, but we can't blame  
the refs,'' Horton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bearcats' ball handling has been the main problem during the  
slump. They had 23 turnovers in the loss to DePaul and 19 against 
Saint Louis, including seven by Horton. 
</P>
<P>
	Horton agreed with Huggins that the early season success might  
have gone to the players' heads, causing them to get sloppy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt happy winning before. We got comfortable with it,''  
Horton said. ``We thought we could come in every day and go through 
the motions, not take it seriously like we were (before). It caught 
up with us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody was patting them on the back and telling them how  
good they were and we kind of got away from what we're good at 
doing,'' Huggins said.

<HEADLINE> Hand Transplant Man Rejoices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Matthew Scott smiles as he ponders the  
personal triumphs he longs to achieve with his famous new left hand 
-- like slipping on his wedding ring and hoisting his two young 
sons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very well aware of what I've been lucky enough to  
receive,'' said Scott, 37, the nation's first hand transplant 
recipient. 
</P>
<P>
	But even while he rejoices, Scott reflects on others who've lost  
hands or other limbs and are waiting for their own medical 
miracles. Scott said he hopes they'll someday savor his joy and new 
outlook on life. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this goes well ... I just hope to be the first step of many  
steps,'' the paramedic from Absecon, N.J., said in an interview 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 20 or 30 years, I'd like to be forgotten,'' Scott said. ``I  
hope in 20 or 30 years the science of transplantation and working 
with limbs has become so commonplace that I'm a footnote and not 
the story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others already have already volunteered to follow in Scott's  
footsteps. Carrie Marcell, hand transplant coordinator at Jewish 
Hospital, said more than 100 people have contacted her since 
Scott's historic 14 1/2-hour operation Jan. 24-25 at the Louisville 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgeons hope to perform several other hand transplants to gain  
a more thorough understanding of the procedure's effects. A couple 
of other people have cleared the review process and are deemed 
appropriate candidates for hand transplants, Ms. Marcell said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once the surgery was done, it really started picking up,'' she  
said. ``We're constantly evaluating patients and have had a lot of 
interest. It's from all over the United States and from other 
countries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital has heard from people in Germany, Japan, India,  
South Africa, Turkey, Colombia, Argentina, Brazil and the Middle 
East, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Potential candidates are put through medical, psychiatric and  
psychological tests. Their medical histories are scrutinized and 
they are bluntly told of the risks associated with the medication 
that suppresses the immune system, which is necessary to prevent 
the body from rejecting the foreign tissue in the new hand, taken 
from a cadaver. 
</P>
<P>
	Some callers have asked about transplants to restore feet or  
lower legs, but they have been turned away. 
</P>
<P>
	There is only one other man in the world with a transplanted  
hand, an Australian who underwent the graft in France in September. 
An attempt at a hand transplant was made in the 1960s, but it 
failed. Scott hasn't talked with the Australian recipient, but 
hopes to someday. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott said he considers the new hand his own, and has marveled  
at the similarity in size and color with his right hand. 
</P>
<P>
	The new hand also offers a chance to blot out his own tragedy  
when his left hand was blown off in a fireworks explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly think I've been given the ability to go back and  
right, in my mind, what was wrong and to perhaps put to rest an 
unfortunate event that happened in my life 13 years ago,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is it a new lease on life? It's a different lease. It's a way  
to look at life differently now than I have for the past 13 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scott has moved out of Jewish Hospital and into a temporary  
residence near the hospital. He goes through hours of therapy 
daily, hoping to realize the full potential of his new hand. 
</P>
<P>
	But he dwells on small accomplishments that carry great personal  
importance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly one of the things that I can't wait to do is to get  
my wedding ring on my left hand,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A natural left-hander, Scott also hopes to sign his name with  
his new hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors have been pleased with his recovery and say there are no  
signs that his body is rejecting the transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	But how would he react if things went awry and he lost his new  
hand? 
</P>
<P>
	``I will certainly be disappointed, there is no getting around  
that,'' he said. ``This is, for somebody in my situation, the Holy 
Grail, I guess you could say. And to have it in your hand, so to 
speak, and then not, would be a great disappointment.''

	The singer arrived at Spann's South Side campaign headquarters

<HEADLINE> Pro-Kurdish Rally Held in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- A protester set himself ablaze outside  
parliament Monday in demonstrations to demand Greece grant 
political asylum to fugitive Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan. 
</P>
<P>
	The flames were put out by other protesters and firefighters,  
who were on the scene after threats of self-immolations from some 
of the estimated 200 protesters. 
</P>
<P>
	The demonstrator suffered serious burns to the face and hands,  
while another protester standing nearby received slight burns and 
was also treated for shock, police said. It wasn't immediately 
clear what the protester used as an accelerant. 
</P>
<P>
	Riot police scuffled with the demonstrators, including many  
children, who carried flags and banners bearing pictures of Ocalan. 
No other injuries were reported, but 50 protesters were detained. 
</P>
<P>
	Greece has refused to offer political asylum to Ocalan, who is  
sought by Turkey on terrorism charges connected his Kurdistan 
Workers Party's 15-year fight for autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, another group of Kurds, some 500 refugees from Iraq,  
were stranded on buses Monday as police tried to persuade an Athens 
hospital to allow them to be temporarily housed in the hospital's 
abandoned leper wing. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital said it couldn't accept the refugees and  
neighborhood residents blocked the entrance to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kurds have been living in tents in in central Koumoundourou  
square for months. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 50,000 Iraqi Kurds illegally enter Greece each  
year, many en route to Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kurdish homeland encompasses a geographical area overlapping  
parts of Turkey, Iraq and Iran. In Turkey, more than 37,000 people 
have died in the Kurd's fight. 
</P>
<P>
	In Turkey on Monday, a Kurdish singer, Ahmet Aya, was arrested  
for allegedly aiding Kurdish rebels. A conviction could result in 
five years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahmet Kaya triggered a controversy by saying at an award  
ceremony that he would begin singing in the Kurdish language. He 
was also seen at a concert in Germany that was organized to benefit 
a Kurdish rebel group. He reportedly also made a speech in favor of 
the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey is frequently criticized for human rights violations in  
connection with the Kurds. 
</P>
<P>
	The country's 12 million Kurds are prohibited from using their  
language in education or broadcasting.

<HEADLINE> Volvo May Takeover Navistar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Swedish vehicle maker Volvo AB says it is talking  
to U.S. truck manufacturer Navistar International Corp. about a 
possible takeover, the Financial Times reported in Monday's 
editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior executives from Volvo, which agreed last month to sell  
its automobile division to Ford Motor Co., have met with officials 
from Chicago-based Navistar to discuss a buyout offer, the 
newspaper said, quoting an unnamed source close to the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	The report speculated that the deal could be worth at least $3  
billion, but added that the price could be substantially lower if 
Volvo acquired only Navistar's heavy truck operations. The 
discussions may also only lead to some kind of alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	A takeover would more than double Volvo's share of the North  
American truck market, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Navistar International, the United States' third-largest heavy  
truck manufacturer, also makes medium-sized trucks and school 
buses, and builds diesel engines. It exports trucks and parts to 
more than 80 dealers in 75 countries and sells its merchandise 
through about 1,000 dealers in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	Navistar's market value is about $2.3 billion, based on Friday's  
closing stock price of $35.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Phone calls to Navistar headquarters in Chicago by The  
Associated Press were not answered Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides its well-known car division, Volvo also makes trucks,  
buses, construction equipment and marine and aviation engines. The 
proposed sale of Volvo's car division to Ford for $6.45 billion is 
aimed at giving Volvo the resources to concentrate on developing 
its other divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo last month surprised markets by acquiring 13 percent of  
the stock in rival Swedish truck-maker Scania and is making an 
effort to buy the company. If successful, Volvo would be Europe's 
largest truck manufacturer.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks End Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks rose today for the third  
consecutive trading day, supported by last week's government 
decision to pump public funds into the nation's major banks. The 
dollar slipped against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 81.03 points,  
or 0.58 percent, closing the day's trading at 14,054.72. On Friday, 
the index rose 21.29 points, or 0.15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 114.08 yen in late afternoon trading, down  
0.24 yen from its level Friday in Tokyo and also below its New York 
level of 114.21 yen on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan announced on Friday a plan to inject $66  
billion in public funds into 15 major banks in an attempt to 
prevent Japan's banking system from collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks also got a boost after the central bank said late Friday  
it was cutting a key interest rate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan's policy board lowered its target for  
overnight call money -- the rate banks charge each other for 
unsecured short-term loans -- to an all-time low of 0.15 percent 
from 0.25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower interest rates tend to cut borrowing costs for companies,  
helping to spur the nation's economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not as though the banks' bad loan problems will be  
solved with this measure,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager of 
the stock division at Tokyo Securities. ``But at least it relieves 
worries about the banks having a capital shortage come the end of 
the fiscal year in March,'' Hatae said. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 338  
million shares, down from Friday's turnover of 452 million shares. 
Advances outnumbered declines 659 to 448, with 173 issues 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 5.49 points, or 0.50 percent, to 1,095.02. The 
TOPIX rose 6.44 points, or 0.59 percent, Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, trading remained thin ahead of the U.S.  
national holiday today and the Chinese New Year holidays in Hong 
Kong and Singapore on Tuesday and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the market largely shrugged off other potential  
market-moving factors today, including rising U.S.-Japan trade 
friction over steel and figures showing that Japan's current 
account surplus rose by 13 percent in December from a year earlier, 
pushing the total for all of 1998 to a record high. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 128.70 yen, up from  
128.54 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 2.135 percent from Friday's finish of 2.080 percent, 
driving its price down to 97.39 yen from 97.81 yen.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Might Run for NY Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A possible race between Hillary Rodham Clinton  
and New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani for a Senate seat in 2000 would 
be a ``titanic struggle,'' one Republican senator says. 
</P>
<P>
	White House aides said Sunday that with President Clinton's  
impeachment trial over, the first lady will now sit down with those 
who want her to consider a run for the Senate from New York next 
year to replace fellow Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's going to talk to the people who have been urging her to  
run, think about it. But I will tell you one thing: I think that if 
she does run, she will win,'' White House chief of staff John 
Podesta said on ABC's ``This Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``People in Washington are just catching on to something that  
people know all over the country,'' White House communications 
director Ann Lewis said on CNN's ``Late Edition,'' praising the 
first lady's grasp of health care and other issues. ``There are a 
lot of people in New York who think she would be a great senator 
and are very excited about the prospect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's backers have for months been floating the idea of  
her making a run for the seat that Moynihan is surrendering after 
24 years. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Republican side, Giuliani, who has made no formal  
announcement of his intentions, is considered a leading potential 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would make this a titanic struggle of two very popular  
figures,'' Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who is in charge of 
fund-raising for Republican senatorial candidates, told CNN. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would be an incredible race. It might be one of the  
great races in history, Giuliani vs. Mrs. Clinton,'' Sen. John 
McCain, R-Ariz., said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moynihan, also on NBC, welcomed Mrs. Clinton as a candidate and  
predicted she would win. He said New York could probably use some 
of her ``magnificent, young, bright, able, Illinois-Arkansas 
enthusiasm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She would probably have a clear field if she decided to run,  
Moynihan said, although political life in New York ``can get a 
little rough on the frontiers.'' Rep. Nita Lowey is among the 
Democrats already mentioned as possible candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is ``going to be very deliberative about this. This  
is going to be a major life change,'' said Democratic Sen. Frank 
Lautenberg from neighboring New Jersey. ``I think she would be one 
terrific candidate,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is expected to be very much in the public eye now  
that the Senate has acquitted the president of perjury and 
obstruction of justice charges. She plans to travel nationwide 
promoting her husband's Social Security and Medicare proposals, 
make another ``spring break'' mission overseas, probably with 
daughter Chelsea; and take her ``America's treasures'' tour to the 
West to promote historic preservation.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Hails Clinton for Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MERIDA, Mexico (AP) -- Addressing rampant speculation back home  
about a ``Hillary for Senate'' campaign, President Clinton endorsed 
the idea today and said his wife would be ``great if she did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Mrs. Clinton has made no decision, he cautioned.  
</P>
<P>
	``First of all I think it's important that everyone understand  
that people in New York started calling her. I don't think it had 
ever occurred to her before a lot of people started calling and 
asking her to do it,'' Clinton said in exchange with reporters 
after his private meeting with Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think she would be terrific in the Senate. ... She would be  
great if she did it,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But that's a decision that she'll have to make. And for  
reasons I'm sure you'll understand she hasn't had anything like 
adequate time to talk to the people who think she should do this -- 
much less people who think perhaps she shouldn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president added that he will support ``enthusiastically''  
however Mrs. Clinton decides to dedicate herself in the years 
beyond their White House tenure. 
</P>
<P>
	``She and I both would like to continue to be useful in public  
affairs when we leave office,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's prospects were all the talk on Sunday TV news  
programs with a Republican senator saying the possible Senate race 
between her and New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani would be a 
``titanic struggle.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Anheuser-Busch said Monday it has learned that  
the National Labor Relations Board intends to dismiss charges filed 
against the brewer by the Teamsters union. 
</P>
<P>
	The union had challenged the company's implementation last  
September of its final contract offer covering some 8,000 
Anheuser-Busch U.S. brewery employees represented by the union. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pleased that the Board has recognized we have acted  
properly throughout this process and that it is clear that the 
parties reached impasse,'' said William L. Rammes, the vice 
president of corporate human resources. ``This demonstrates that 
the union's charges to the contrary were without merit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Board officials told the company that it will also dismiss  
another Teamster charge that had challenged the company's 
elimination of union dues checkoff, its protection of internal 
company documents on the implementation process and the format of 
final offer clarifications, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Formal written notification of the Board's decision is expected  
to be received within a few days. 
</P>
<P>
	NLRB offices were closed Monday for the Presidents Day holiday.  
No one at the Teamsters could immediately be reached by the

<HEADLINE> Calif. Bookstore Seeking Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Independent bookseller Patrice Wynne knew  
it was going to take a lot more than meditation to save her 
spiritually oriented bookstore when sales dipped for the first time 
in its 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	So Ms. Wynne is asking her customers to help save her Berkeley  
bookstore by making an investment that offers no material return. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not want the books sold in Berkeley to be mediated by  
corporate chains, Barnes &AMP; Noble and Amazon.com,'' Ms. Wynne said. 
``We're saying, 'You're a Main Street investor that has a social 
and cultural return on your investment by making a donation.' ... 
It's a model of reciprocity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Using just $2,000, Ms. Wynne, who comes from a family of  
small-business owners, launched GAIA bookstore with her husband in 
1987 and immediately began turning a profit. With its sunny, 
comfortable interior, GAIA eventually become one of the nation's 
largest spiritual bookstores with 250 author events annually, and 
took in a $63,000 profit in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	But GAIA, which the city of Berkeley has officially designated a  
cultural institution, will have to close at the end of March if Ms. 
Wynne can't raise the $300,000 needed to get out of debt, plus an 
additional $100,000 to keep running. Though she would not provide 
detailed figures, sales were down $200,000 in 1998 and she expects 
a significant loss. 
</P>
<P>
	It started last year, as she watched her customers gravitate to  
the Internet. Each month sales were down 20 percent from the same 
time the year before. The red ink crested in November, with a 37 
percent drop. 
</P>
<P>
	She announced in December that she was shutting down, but within  
days an anonymous, longtime Berkeley resident stepped forward. The 
person offered to match up to $200,000 donated by other patrons. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Wynne passed the word and the calls started coming in. As of  
Friday, GAIA had pulled in $45,000 in donations from as far away as 
New York and Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade Inc. in Vermont. About 10 
writers have volunteered to match proceeds brought in by their 
readings at GAIA. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were just deluged with customers saying, 'What can we do to  
help keep you open?''' Ms. Wynne said recently while taking a break 
at an American Booksellers Association meeting in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Avin Mark Domnitz, the chief executive of the ABA, said the only  
similar case he could think of was that of an anonymous donor who 
gave $1 million to a struggling South Carolina bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
	And unlike other companies that looked to investors for help,  
Ms. Wynee isn't selling shares in GAIA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that this kind of expression of support from a  
community you may see more and more of as customers see the 
independent bookstore is threatened by outside bookstores,'' 
Domnitz said. ``The threats keep coming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of the so-called ``bricks and mortar'' bookstores that captured  
about 50 percent of the market in the second quarter of 1998, more 
than half of sales were generated in four chain stores. Warehouse 
clubs like Costco and Kmart, which also offer big discounts, took 
another 49 percent, according to the ABA. 
</P>
<P>
	And although online sellers currently have only a tiny 1 1/2  
percent of the $12.3 billion retail book market, independent store 
owners believe they're making a significant dent. Even GAIA, part 
of which functions as a nonprofit community center, is developing a 
Web site that will allow its techno-savvy customers to buy online. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone in the industry expects independent stores to stay  
alive by running a capital campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is pretty much a one-of-a-kind occurrence. I  
can't see it happening very often,'' said Kevin Howell, an editor 
at trade magazine Publisher's Weekly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe those customers are a little more loyal. It's very much  
a niche store as opposed to if it were just a general (interest).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wellington's, an independent bookstore in the  
technology-saturated Research Triangle Park area of North Carolina, 
was sold two years ago to 18 ``techies,'' stay-at-home moms and 
retirees concerned about the 40,000 square-foot Barnes &AMP; Noble 
against which the owner felt it would eventually become impossible 
to compete. 
</P>
<P>
	Her prediction ultimately came true. With Borders and Bookstar  
stores also in an area populated by a wealth of online 25- to 
34-year-olds, Wellington's closed its doors in Cary on Feb. 5.

<HEADLINE> Gordon Wins Despite Odds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Kid won anyway.  
</P>
<P>
	Everybody else had allies. He had nothing but enemies.  
Throughout the Daytona 500, Jeff Gordon might as well have had a 
bullseye drawn on the back of his race car. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't even get to his bumper,'' Dale Earnhardt said. ``If  
I could have, maybe I could have done something with him. But he 
was strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Gordon just got me on the apron down there,'' Rusty Wallace  
said. ``I couldn't block him off enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	These are the things rivals are supposed to say whenever  
somebody else walks off with one of their sport's crown jewels. But 
when Gordon is involved, you just know, somehow, that those regrets 
run deeper, that the envy simmers closer to the surface and the 
vows to make sure he doesn't win the next time take on the 
seriousness of blood oaths. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of Sunday's race, after Gordon had won his second  
Daytona in three years and was cruising along at a victory-lap 
pace, Earnhardt pulled his black No. 3 Chevy alongside Gordon's 
rainbow-hued No. 24 and gave him a little bump. 
</P>
<P>
	It was done in good humor, perhaps even in goodwill, a gesture  
of grudging admiration. But if Earnhardt had had the same 
opportunity just moments earlier, as the two played cat-and-mouse 
at 190 mph over the 2 1/2-mile oval, the bite would not have been 
friendly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trying to keep him behind me,'' Gordon said, ``is one of the  
hardest things I've ever done at Daytona.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hear Gordon talk like that, watch the way he behaves after a  
race, and it's hard to know what he's done to inspire so much 
dislike. And not just from the guys he's up against week after 
week, but from the fans of every one of them. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, for instance, Gordon went out of his way to credit  
Earnhardt, not just for showing him the move that put him ahead to 
stay, but for the actual bump that put him into the lead in the 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
	In the span of a few hair-raising seconds, Gordon took his Chevy  
down below the yellow line, ducking underneath the leader, Wallace, 
and squeezing past the slow-moving lapped car of Rick Rudd. Instead 
of responding to Gordon the way it usually does, with boos, the 
NASCAR crowd of 185,000 gasped. That became a roar as Gordon drew 
even with Wallace, and Earnhardt's teammate, Mike Skinner, did the 
same on the outside. 
</P>
<P>
	As they headed into the third turn three-wide, Earnhardt, just  
behind them, was trying to force his way into the lead. He decided 
the most direct route was to bump Gordon into the lead, then 
overtake him at some point during the final 10 laps. 
</P>
<P>
	The flaw in that thinking is that Gordon learned how to protect  
the lead from ``The Master'' himself, which is what he calls 
Earnhardt. It didn't matter, finally, whether Earnhardt slid his 
car high or low on the banked track looking for his opening. Like a 
student eager to please, Gordon anticipated his every move. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's taught me so much out there,'' Gordon said. ``He's  
probably going to tell you I learned too much from him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In this case, there is no such thing. Like most of the racers on  
the circuit, Gordon has teammates; unlike most of the racers, 
however, that's the only place he's likely to find help in a jam. 
And help is especially important at Daytona, one of just two races 
where NASCAR-mandated restrictor plates limits every car's 
horsepower, a feature that makes for unusually close racing and 
plenty of drafting. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the week, two-time winner Dale Jarrett talked about  
how, ``Everybody is looking to make deals here.'' What he meant was 
that a car that slipped out of line looking to gain an edge had 
better have another car to push or pull him in a drafting 
arrangement -- or risk losing 15 or 20 positions as the field goes 
zooming by. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon rarely gets the benefit of such help. It could be because  
he's young, or because he's an outsider, or simply because since 
arriving on the circuit in 1993, Gordon has done nothing but win. 
Either way, few other drivers have offered to help and Gordon has 
rarely asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Thursday, he was out front for 38 laps during one of the  
qualifying races only to have Bobby Labonte and Ken Schrader gang 
up on him and go roaring by. Labonte held on to claim the 50-lap 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	But when the biggest of races was on the line, Gordon knew it  
was every racer for himself. He got to the front with one brilliant 
bit of racing and a push from Earnhardt, who used to mockingly 
refer to Gordon as ``Wonder Boy,'' but now must be wondering what 
the rest of them are going to do to keep The Kid from winning them 
all. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Faldo May Face Woods in 1st Round  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Nick Faldo barely held onto the 65th position in the Official  
World Golf Ranking released today, setting up a possible 
first-round match against No. 1 Tiger Woods in the Andersen 
Consulting Match Play Championship next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's rankings will be used to set the field for the 64-man  
event that begins Feb. 24 at La Costa Resort in Carlsbad, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Faldo, the three-time Masters and British Open champion, would  
play Woods in the first round because Jumbo Ozaki, ranked No. 14, 
has told the PGA Tour that he does not plan to play. 
</P>
<P>
	Ozaki has until Wednesday to change his mind, which is unlikely  
since he rarely leaves Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods solidified his position atop the rankings by winning the  
Buick Invitational Sunday, while No. 2 David Duval was skiing in 
Idaho. Duval would play Stephen Leaney of Australia in the first 
round of the $5 million tournament, the first of the three World 
Golf Championship events. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark O'Meara and Davis Love III are tied at No. 3 in the  
rankings. O'Meara would get the third seed because he has more 
points in the current year and would play Michael Bradley. Love 
would get Steve Pate, with a possible third-round showdown against 
good friend Fred Couples should both advance. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be interesting and exciting,'' Love said. ``Guys  
who are buddies playing in practice rounds all of a sudden could 
get matched up. I may end up playing Freddie when I'm usually his 
partner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But no match is as tantalizing as Woods and Faldo.  
</P>
<P>
	Faldo, the three-time Masters and British Open champion, hasn't  
won since the Nissan Open at Los Angeles two years ago and has 
missed the cut in his two European tour events this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he is dangerous in match play, having won more Ryder Cup  
matches than anyone in history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Between two good professionals on their day, it's anybody's  
game over 18 holes,'' Faldo has said. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods figures to be the favorite at La Costa, especially after  
going 22-under-par over the weekend in San Diego to win his 10th 
tournament since turning pro in August 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the only player to win three consecutive U.S. Amateur  
titles and recently won the PGA Grand Slam of Golf, match play 
between the major championship winners of 1998 (Woods was the first 
alternate since O'Meara won two majors last year). 
</P>
<P>
	But the dream pairing almost didn't come off. Faldo was on the  
fence at No. 65 when he missed the cut in the Dubai Desert Classic, 
and four players had a good chance to move past him on the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Turner could have tied for third with one other player in  
the Australian Masters to move up to No. 65. He was tied for the 
lead at one point Sunday, but wound up in a three-way tie for third 
and came up two points short. 
</P>
<P>
	David Toms could have moved up to No. 65 with a three-way tie  
for seventh in the Buick Invitational. Toms had a 12-foot birdie 
putt at the 18th hole that would have given him seventh place 
alone, but he missed and finished in a five-way tie for seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Perry had to finish second in the Buick. He closed with a  
66 but finished fourth, five strokes behind runner-up Billy Ray 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Per-Ulrik Johansson had to finish in the top 10 in the Dubai  
Desert Classic, but came up four strokes short and was well back. 
</P>
<P>
	The final field will be set at 8 p.m. EST next Monday. Tour  
officials say everyone has committed to play except Ozaki. 
</P>
<P>
	For Faldo, the Match Play is more than a chance to play Woods.  
Last place alone is worth $25,000, which would help him accumulate 
valuable Ryder Cup points. Points for the European team are based 
on official money.

<HEADLINE> Potato Art Shines at Potato Exhibit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSES LAKE, Wash. (AP) -- The potato is more than cheap basic  
nutrition -- it is the inspiration behind flights of artistic fancy. 
</P>
<P>
	At least that's the case in eastern Washington, where the  
ubiquitous tuber transcends its underground reputation and shines 
at an art exhibit each February during National Potato Month. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Adam East Museum and Art Center, space normally devoted  
to serious art is occupied by preserved potato peels, smiling Tater 
Tots and potato-theme water colors painted using water spiked with 
potato juice. 
</P>
<P>
	A half-baked concept?  
</P>
<P>
	``We all need a little humor in this serious world,'' Terry  
Mulkey, the gallery's manager, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baked, Mashed and Fried'' invites celebration and examination  
-- by artists and just ordinary folks -- to the spud's aesthetic 
side. There's also as much as $550 in cash prizes up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the 27 entries in this year's juried contest are  
serious, including artist Carolann Swartz' still-life ink drawings, 
titled ``Potato Study Triptych.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others focus on the spud's lighter side.  
</P>
<P>
	The winner of this year's $200 ``Golden Potato'' award -- the  
potato de resistance, if you will -- is ``Larry's Half-Baked Theory 
of Evolution'' by Larry and Joyce Oates. 
</P>
<P>
	The mixed-media diorama depicts primordial potatoes slithering  
out of the sea and onto land. But after that huge evolutionary 
leap, the spud ends up on a floral-pattern couch, blankly staring 
at a television set. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad we have a vegetable that's so exciting to use as an  
artistic subject. It wouldn't be nearly as fun to have an exhibit 
on grape art,'' said Teri Looney, a librarian who also entered her 
own potato sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit, now in its sixth year, is backed by the Washington  
State Potato Commission, which is always on the lookout for ways to 
promote its cash crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Russell, a pharmacist, paid $225 for one work, a  
mixed-media collage of a woman peeling potatoes, titled, ``How many 
people did you say you were inviting to dinner?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I hadn't really thought of the potato as a subject for art  
until I saw this show,'' he said. ``It's pretty amazing what you 
can do with a potato.''

<HEADLINE> No New Scandals in New Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The deadline for Olympic bidders to tell of  
rule-breaking behavior by IOC members or the cities that tried to 
woo them passed Monday with no new scandals revealed. 
</P>
<P>
	One winning city -- Atlanta -- failed to make the deadline,  
although bid officials said they did not find any wrongdoing during 
an internal review. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent bidders who did submit reports on time told the  
International Olympic Committee they had failed to uncover any 
irregularities -- or declined to say if they had. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wake of the Salt Lake City bribery scandal, the IOC sent  
letters to all cities that bid for the games from 1996 onward, 
asking for any concrete evidence of ethical misconduct by IOC 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said Monday it had no word yet on how many cities had  
replied and would be in a better position to do so Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta's Olympic bidders said they found no evidence of  
wrongdoing in their internal review, but their response to the IOC 
will be late. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Olympic Committee said the results of the review by  
former officials of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games 
would be submitted by March 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``ACOG has advised us they have no information relevant to the  
IOC request,'' USOC spokesman Mike Moran said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Atlanta response had been overshadowed by the USOC's  
need to get information to three other investigations -- by the Salt 
Lake ethics panel, its own ethics commission and the Justice 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	USOC president Bill Hybl would forward the Atlanta response to  
the IOC ``as soon as possible. We anticipate no problem,'' Moran 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Japanese Olympic officials said they would tell the  
IOC that nine IOC members may have broken rules during Nagano's 
successful bid for the 1992 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no such revelations Monday in an AP survey of recent  
key bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Berlin (2000 Games): ``It's been investigated and it's all on  
the table. We didn't see any rules being broken,'' said Heiner 
Henze, general secretary of the Germany Olympic committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the opposition Greens party in the Berlin legislature  
said it had sent its r own report to IOC detailing what it called 
``irregularities'' by IOC members. Judith Demba, a Greens leader, 
termed the IOC ``a club of corrupt old men.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Manchester (1996 and 2000) and Birmingham (1992), England:  
Simon Clegg, chief executive of the British Olympic Association, 
said a report was sent to the IOC but its contents were 
confidential. 
</P>
<P>
	``The findings of the IOC will be announced in due course, until  
then the BOA will respect the confidentiality contained in the 
report,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of Manchester's bid committee had earlier  
characterized treatment of IOC members as ``gross hospitality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- St. Petersburg, Russia (2004): Neither the Russian Olympic  
committee nor the St. Petersburg bidding committee will submit a 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have sent no letter since there was nothing to report,''  
said Alexander Ratner, Russian Olympic committee spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Rome (2004): Italian IOC member Mario Pescante said there  
would be no submission. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we have sent a letter, nor are we sending one.  
We don't have anything to report,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Athens (1996 and 2004): Lambis Nikolaou, president of the  
Greek Olympic committee, said there was no ``problem with any 
member of the IOC for Athens 1996 or 2004. We have no evidence of 
wrongdoing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Cape Town, South Africa (2004): ``We were not involved in  
offering any inducement for votes,'' said Chris Ball, who led Cape 
Town's bid. He declined to give details of his report to the IOC. 
``I have to be discreet,'' he said. ``It's an IOC matter.''

<HEADLINE> Disney World Worker Killed in Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- A part-time custodian at Walt Disney World  
died after he was swept from a platform by an elevated cable car 
and fell 40 feet to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Raymond Barlow was on a platform for the Skyway in Fantasyland  
when the cable-car ride was switched on in preparation for the 
park's opening Sunday morning. Whoever switched it on didn't know 
Barlow was standing in the path of the cars, Orange County 
sheriff's Deputy Robert Larson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barlow, 65, grabbed the four-person gondola and struggled to  
pull himself inside. He let go when he was over a flowerbed, 
snapping tree branches on the way down, park employees told 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was looking for a place to fall. He didn't want to fall on  
the concrete, so he fell on the flowerbed,'' Larson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barlow, who was hired in September, died a short time later at  
Orlando Regional Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The ride, which stretches between Fantasyland and Tomorrowland,  
was back in operation after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are deeply saddened by what happened and our hearts go out  
to the family and friends of this `cast member,''' said Disney 
spokeswoman Rena Callahan. ``Disney puts a high priority on 
safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first fatality for the Orlando park since October  
1989, when a woman was killed in a boat collision. A 4-year-old 
girl died during a ride in 1995, but an autopsy concluded the ride 
did not contribute to her death.

Eve accident when a metal cleat ripped loose from a ship and hit 
him in the head.

<HEADLINE> Increase Seen in Seat Belt Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After being stalled for years, the percentage  
of Americans wearing seat belts increased in 1998 -- the same year 
police organizations started widespread campaigns to enforce seat 
belt laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The national percentage jumped from 62.2 percent to 65.1 percent  
around the Memorial Day holiday, and again from 69.6 percent to 
70.1 percent around the Thanksgiving holiday, said the National 
Highway Traffic Safety Administration in figures the agency was 
releasing Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Those jumps coincided with weeklong crackdowns in which 4,000  
law enforcement agencies erected checkpoints and ticketed drivers 
who were not wearing seat belts. They also broke a three-year trend 
in which national seat belt usage hovered in the 60 percent range. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials and seat belt advocates plan to use the  
evidence to encourage more states to pass primary seat belt laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Under such laws, which have already been adopted in 14 states  
and the District of Columbia, police can pull over drivers for not 
wearing their seat belt. Under more widespread secondary laws, 
police can ticket drivers for not wearing a seat belt only if they 
have been pulled over for another reason. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say primary laws are needed for two reasons: Seat  
belt use doesn't increase otherwise, and research shows that 
parents who do not wear seat belts themselves are more likely to 
leave their children unbuckled. Car accidents are the No. 1 killer 
of children 14 and under. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we know what's killing our kids and we're not applying the  
medicine, shame on us as a nation for not acting,'' said Janet 
Dewey, executive director of the Air Bag &AMP; Seat Belt Safety 
Campaign. The group, sponsored by the auto industry and insurance 
companies, works in conjunction with the Transportation Department 
and the highway safety administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign announced Monday it was sending children to 11  
Statehouses across the country to lobby governors and legislative 
leaders for primary laws. It also planned lobbying campaigns in 
Florida, Ohio, Alabama, Illinois, Virginia and New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater and Dr. Ricardo Martinez,  
head of the safety administration, were holding a separate news 
conference in Washington on Tuesday to unveil the government 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	All told, the numbers showed that 19 million more Americans wore  
seat belts in 1998. If they continue to do so this year, the 
government estimates some 1,500 lives will be saved. 
</P>
<P>
	Seat belt statistics have traditionally been unreliable. Some  
states measure usage by all drivers, while others check only car 
drivers and not those in trucks or sports-utility vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  
had an independent firm scientifically measure seat belt usage 
around the crackdowns. Two sets of surveys were conducted, one 
before and after Memorial Day and the other around the Thanksgiving 
holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	They showed a cumulative increase from 62.2 percent before  
Memorial Day to 70.1 percent after Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
	In surveys completed by the same firm in 1994 and 1996, the  
safety administration found seat belt usage to be 58.9 percent and 
61 percent, respectively. Publicly released figures -- based on the 
more unreliable state statistics -- set the figure at 68 percent for 
the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a $203 billion highway bill passed last year by Congress,  
states must begin compiling statistics in much the same manner used 
internally by the safety administration. That should lead to more 
reliable reporting in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, both the government and seat belt groups believe  
that previous seat belt campaigns have reached all of the Americans 
who are going to buckle up willingly. Now they think new laws, 
stricter enforcement and harsh advertising campaigns are needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, the National Highway Traffic Safety  
Administration replaced TV ads featuring the lovable crash test 
dummies Vince and Larry with more gruesome spots showing unbuckled 
drivers hurt in crashes around their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	After each accident, a caption on the screen asks, ``Didn't see  
that coming? No one ever does. Buckle up.''

<HEADLINE> Privacy Groups Urge Intel Boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Days before the debut of the fastest ever  
computer processor from Intel Corp., the chip's critics sought 
Monday to widen their boycott and enlist the government in opposing 
the new technology, which they say will allow easy tracing of 
Internet users. 
</P>
<P>
	The organizers of the boycott, Junkbusters Corp. of Green Brook,  
N.J., and the Washington-based Electronic Privacy Information 
Center, sent letters to privacy and consumer groups, encouraging 
them to get the Federal Trade Commission involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, the world's largest computer chip-maker, announced last  
month that its upcoming Pentium III chip will be able to transmit a 
unique serial number internally and to Web sites that request it. 
This could be used to verify the identity of Web site users. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said the technology will help online merchants  
eliminate fraud, but some privacy groups contend it gives companies 
unprecedented ability to trace a consumer's digital footprints as 
they wander the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentium III will be launched officially Feb. 26, but the  
company has invited reporters and industry analysts to talk with 
executives about the technology Wednesday at a preview conference 
in San Jose, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the protest groups sent letters seeking support from  
the American Civil Liberties Union, Center for Democracy and 
Technology, Center for Media Education, Electronic Frontier 
Foundation, Consumer Project on Technology and others active in the 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The letters asked these groups to urge the FTC to consider  
stopping Intel from distributing its new technology and to warn the 
industry's largest computer makers expected to sell machines using 
the new chip. 
</P>
<P>
	FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky has already indicated he doesn't  
believe that his agency, which normally fights consumer fraud and 
deceptive trade practices, can require Intel to stop selling its 
Pentium III chips. 
</P>
<P>
	``As things stand, I don't think we have the authority to do  
that,'' Pitofsky told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate letter to Pitofsky, the groups warned that  
consumers will not participate in commerce over the Internet 
because they fear their privacy could be compromised. The Pentium 
III technology ``will move reality much closer to these consumers' 
worst fears,'' the groups wrote the FTC. 
</P>
<P>
	An Intel spokesman, Chuck Mulloy, said, ``They certainly have  
the right to write letters to anyone they want. We think we've 
given consumers enough choice -- consumers choice and choice for the 
(computer makers).'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the planned boycott was announced last month, Intel  
officials said they will include software that allows consumers to 
turn off the new technology and that the company will encourage 
computer makers to turn it off by default in machines they sell. 
</P>
<P>
	The privacy groups argued that some Web sites will require the  
technology be turned on and that some companies will mandate its 
use to prevent software piracy. ``Experience shows that consumers 
will be coerced into submitting to the tracking mechanism,'' they 
wrote to the FTC. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel has said it expects to spend $300 million worldwide  
promoting its new processor, which will feature 70 new built-in 
instructions that will boost the performance of graphics, 
multimedia and voice-recognition software. 
</P>
<P>
	The company supplies roughly 85 percent of the world's computer  
processors and had $26.2 billion in sales last year.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jaki Byard, a pianist, saxophonist and music  
teacher who recorded with modern jazz artists Charles Mingus and 
Rahasaan Roland Kirk, was found shot dead at his home on Thursday. 
He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were investigating the shooting, which went unheard by  
Byard's family members. 
</P>
<P>
	Byard's playing spanned the history of jazz. His improvisations  
included boogie-woogie and free jazz with zippy stylistic changes. 
</P>
<P>
	Byard taught for several decades and was instrumental in the  
re-evaluation of jazz history that began in the late 1970s. Early 
in his career he was a big player in the Boston jazz scene. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1960s, Byard began recording with Mingus. He played  
on the classic albums ``Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus'' and 
``The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Duke Ellington became sick just before he died, Byard  
played piano in the Ellington Orchestra.

<P>
	JACKSON, Mich. (AP) -- Denise B. Cavins, a reporter for The  
Jackson Citizen Patriot for 32 years, died Sunday of cancer. She 
was 58. 
</P>
<P>
	During her career she covered a wide range of stories including  
Jackson Republicans at the 1981 inauguration of President Reagan 
and a series of articles on Nickolas B. Peck, a hockey player who 
lost his lower legs to meningitis in December 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	She worked for two years at the South Bend Tribune in Indiana  
before starting at the Citizen Patriot in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last seven years of her career, Ms. Cavins covered  
government and school news in Blackman Township, the western side 
of Jackson County and eastern part of Calhoun County. She retired 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include her mother, brother-in-law, two nieces, a  
nephew and two great-nephews.

	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Retired Judge Harry A. Cole, the first black to  
serve on the state's highest court and to be elected to the state 
Senate, died Sunday of complications from pneumonia. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Cole became the first black to win a state Senate seat in 1954.  
In 1977, he was the first black named to the Maryland Court of 
Appeals, where he served until his retirement in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	During his tenure on the court, Cole wrote the unanimous opinion  
that upheld the right of the state to fund abortions for poor 
women.

	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Jimmy Dudley, the radio voice of the  
Cleveland Indians from 1948, the year the team won its last World 
Series, until 1967, died Friday of a stroke. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
	After apprenticing as an announcer for the Chicago Cubs after  
the war, he was hired by the Indians. He also did play-by-play for 
the Cleveland Browns in the 1950s, for the Baltimore Colts and for 
Ohio State University football games. 
</P>
<P>
	He became the voice of the Seattle Pilots in 1969, but a year  
later, the team transferred to Milwaukee, leaving him behind. 
Dudley never announced a major league game again. 
</P>
<P>
	Dudley was inducted into the broadcasters' wing of the Baseball  
Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., in 1997.

</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- John D. Ehrlichman, President Nixon's domestic  
affairs adviser who was imprisoned for 18 months for the Watergate 
conspiracy, died Sunday of natural causes. He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
	Ehrlichman, who along with H.R. Haldeman was one of Nixon's two  
top advisers, resigned from his White House post in April 1973 and 
was convicted two years later for obstruction of justice, 
conspiracy and perjury in the attempted cover-up of the burglary of 
the Democratic National Committee offices at the Watergate complex 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	As the cover-up began to unravel and pressure mounted, Nixon  
summoned Haldeman and domestic counsel John Ehrlichman to the 
presidential cabin at Camp David, Md., in April 1973 and told them 
they would have to resign. The next day, he fired White House 
counsel John Dean, and accepted the resignations of Haldeman, 
Ehrlichman and Attorney General Richard Kleindienst. 
</P>
<P>
	Under threat of impeachment, Nixon resigned on Aug. 9, 1974. He  
was later pardoned by President Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	Ehrlichman spent 18 months at Swift Trail Camp, a  
minimum-security federal prison south of Safford, Ariz., and was 
released in 1978. Haldeman also served 18 months in prison and died 
in November 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	After getting out of prison, he moved to Santa Fe, N.M., where  
he began a new career as an artist, writer and commentator. 
Ehrlichman wrote four novels: ``The Company'' 1976; ``The Whole 
Truth'' 1979; ``The China Card'' 1986; (co-author) of ``The Rigby 
File'' 1989. He also wrote a memoir that was published in 1983, 
``Witness to Power: The Nixon Years.''

<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Sen. Libero Gualtieri, who led the parliamentary  
inquiry into the kidnap-murder of Italian Prime Minister Aldo Moro, 
died Monday of an aneurism. He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	While president of the Parliamentary Commission on Massacres  
from 1988 to 1994, Gualtieri investigated the 1978 murder of Moro, 
who was kidnapped and then slain by members of the Red Brigades. 
</P>
<P>
	Gualtieri also led the parliamentary probe into the 1980 crash  
of a domestic airliner near the island of Ustica. Investigators 
never learned what caused the DC-9 to blow apart, killing 81 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	Gualtieri also investigated alleged illicit activities by the  
Italian secret services. 
</P>
<P>
	Gualtieri joined the Democrats of the Left in the last  
legislature. First elected in 1979, he had held his previous seats 
with the Republican Party.

<P>
	BREMERTON, Wash. (AP) -- Buddy Wayne Knox, a rockabilly singer  
and songwriter who hit the top of the charts with ``Party Doll'' ih 
the 1950s, died Sunday of cancer. He was 65. 
</P>
<P>
	Knox penned his biggest hit, ``Party Doll,'' as early as 1948.  
Seven years later, he formed the Rhythm Orchids with Jimmy Bowen on 
bass and Don Lanier on guitar. Studio owner Norman Petty cut 
``Party Doll'' and Bowen's ``I'm Stickin' With You'' on the local 
Triple-D label in 1956, using a cardboard box instead of drums. 
</P>
<P>
	The tunes were later picked up by Roulette's then-new NYC label,  
which split the songs onto two records, each with a ``B'' side. 
</P>
<P>
	Each sold a million copies and ``Party Doll'' became a No. 1  
hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Knox had a string of other songs on the charts in the '50s,  
including ``Hula Love,'' ``Rock Your Little Baby To Sleep,'' and 
``Somebody Touched Me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Knox joined The Crickets, Bobby Vee and The Shirelles  
at a Buddy Holly Tribute concert to mark the 38th anniversary of 
the singer's death. Concerts commemorating ``the day that music 
died'' -- as singer-songwriter Don McLean put it in his 1972 hit 
``American Pie'' -- have become an annual event.

<P>
	EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) -- Dr. Max Samter, a leader in the treatment  
of people with allergies who was known for his groundbreaking 
textbook on immunology, died Feb. 9. He was 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Samter was the first to recognize that patients who had both  
asthma and nasal polyps, a severe inflammation of the tissue lining 
the nose or sinuses, could have a dangerous reaction to aspirin. 
Such patients are now said to have Samter's syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	Samter was president of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma  
and Immunology in 1958-59 and helped establish the International 
Association of Allergology in the 1950s. He retired from the 
University of Illinois in 1975 but continued to treat patients 
until 1992.

	WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Doug Weston, founder of the  
nightclub Troubadour that showcased such folk, rock and comedy acts 
as Joan Baez, Elton John and Lenny Bruce, died Sunday. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	Weston prided himself in the acts and audiences he attracted for  
more than four decades, from singer Linda Ronstadt to comedians 
such as the Smothers Brothers and Cheech &AMP; Chong. 
</P>
<P>
	Weston first set up shop in the 1950s in a 65-seat coffeehouse  
on La Cienega Boulevard. By 1957 he had made enough money to open 
the 300-seat Troubadour in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, the club's acts were consistently impressive:  
the Byrds, Judy Collins, Bill Cosby, the Committee, Bo Diddley, 
Arlo Guthrie, Richie Havens, Gordon Lightfoot, Roger Miller, Joni 
Mitchell, Laura Nyro, Mort Sahl, Kris Kristofferson and Nina 
Simone.

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Spread Fame Around </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The yearlong Monica Lewinsky saga thrust the  
proverbial 15 minutes of fame upon a cast of ordinary people. Some 
relished the limelight, while others grudgingly lost the comforts 
of their anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	White House steward Bayani Nelvis and Oval Office secretary  
Betty Currie looked uneasy when hordes of photographers and 
cameramen surrounded them as they walked into the federal 
courthouse to testify before Kenneth Starr's grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Several White House aides ran up huge legal bills. Catherine  
Allday Davis, a high school friend of Ms. Lewinsky, had to fly all 
the way from Japan to testify. Larry Cockell, the tall, stern 
Secret Service agent who stands beside the president in public, was 
temporarily removed as his chief bodyguard during the legal battle 
over his grand jury testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	And Andrew Bleiler, a Portland, Ore., theater technician, lost  
his marriage over his admission of a five-year affair with Ms. 
Lewinsky. He separated from his wife and plans to divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	But for every figure who counted a personal loss in the  
presidential scandal, another seemed to flourish. 
</P>
<P>
	Book agent Lucianne Goldberg, who encouraged Linda Tripp to make  
the secret tapes that divulged Ms. Lewinsky's affair with President 
Clinton, savored her fame. ``We wanted to be at the center of it,'' 
she told a magazine interviewer. 
</P>
<P>
	A frequent television guest, Goldberg will try to keep her  
profile high with a new radio talk show. But her son, Jonah, who 
used to get 25 to 30 interview requests a week, now gets few. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went through my five minutes of withdrawal after my 15  
minutes of fame was up,'' said Jonah Goldberg, a writer and 
television producer. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet gossip columnist Matt Drudge, first to report  
allegations of the Lewinsky-Clinton affair, parlayed his sudden 
fame into his own 30-minute weekly TV show on the Fox network. 
</P>
<P>
	William Ginsburg, the garrulous California malpractice attorney  
who first represented Ms. Lewinsky, became a ubiquitous presence on 
TV talk shows -- once appearing on five in a single day. But the 
spotlight quickly faded after he was replaced last April by two 
Washington-savvy lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	And Abe Hirschfeld, an eccentric New York real estate magnate,  
invited the cameras to him. At a news conference he offered Paula 
Jones $1 million to settle her sexual harassment lawsuit against 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	But most will now recede into distant memories of a tawdry  
presidential scandal that most Americans could not wait to end. As 
artist Andy Warhol predicted, anyone can be famous, but not for 
very long. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all going to fade, and no one will remember who these  
people were,'' said Thomas Sokolowski, director of The Andy Warhol 
Museum in Pittsburgh.

<HEADLINE> Kasich To Run for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Rep. John Kasich, chairman of the House  
Budget Committee and a champion of tax cuts, laid the groundwork 
today for a longshot presidential campaign based on returning 
``power to the people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to begin to run America from the bottom up,'' Kasich  
told a crowd of 1,300 cheering supporters in his adopted hometown. 
They attended a $100-a-person breakfast this morning that followed 
a $1,000-a-person dinner Sunday night that attracted 300 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich, a nine-term Republican congressman who has been pushing  
for a 10 percent, across-the-board tax cut, announced his plans to 
file papers with the Federal Election Commission to formally 
establish a presidential exploratory committee. Supporters planned 
a rally at Port Columbus International Airport before Kasich left 
for Iowa and New Hampshire, the states that set the primary 
front-runners. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich, 46, joins Sen. John McCain of Arizona, conservative  
activist Gary Bauer, former Vice President Dan Quayle and former 
Secretary of Education Lamar Alexander as Republicans with 
exploratory committees. 
</P>
<P>
	An Ohio State University Buckeyes fight song played as Kasich  
entered a hotel ballroom to address supporters today. The crowd 
waved red signs saying ``Run, John, Run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are hungry for the renewal of the American spirit,'' Kasich  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, it's power from the people and power to the  
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While less well-known than such front-runners as Quaye, Texas  
Gov. George W. Bush or former Cabinet secretary Elizabeth Dole, 
Kasich said voters' lack of familiarity with him could work to his 
advantage. He said he was different from other candidates because 
he was not capitalizing on famous relatives or personal wealth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just a little different and a little fresher than a lot of  
the people who are in politics now,'' Kasich said Sunday on NBC's 
``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a mailman's son from a blue-collar community near  
Pittsburgh,'' Kasich said. ``I got into politics because I wanted 
to change the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich readily admits that he probably won't be able to match  
other candidates' fund-raising skills, but has said he should be 
able to run a credible campaign. He plans to build recognition and 
find donors with the help of the Internet, cable television and 
some offbeat antics, such as a bowling alley tour of Iowa later 
this spring.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Praises Clinton for Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MERIDA, Mexico (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton would make a  
``terrific'' senator from New York state, her husband said Monday, 
``but that's a decision that she'll have to make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With that, President Clinton became the latest member of his  
administration to pump air into a Hillary Clinton-for-Senate 
boomlet. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, whose retirement next  
year will create the vacancy, said New York could use some of Mrs. 
Clinton's ``magnificent, young, bright, able, Illinois-Arkansas 
enthusiasm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She'd be welcome and she'd win,'' Moynihan said.  
</P>
<P>
	Still to be heard from: the potential candidate. About all Mrs.  
Clinton has said about running for the Senate in 2000 is that she 
hasn't had time to think about it -- and she said that through a 
spokesperson. 
</P>
<P>
	What did Mrs. Clinton have to say about her husband's early  
endorsement? ``Nothing,'' said her spokeswoman, Marsha Berry. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, talking to reporters who accompanied him for a meeting  
with Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo, said the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think she would be terrific in the Senate. But that's a  
decision that she'll have to make,'' Clinton said. ``And for 
reasons I'm sure you'll understand she hasn't had anything like 
adequate time to talk to the people who think she should do this -- 
much less people who think perhaps she shouldn't. She just hasn't 
had time to deal with this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he wanted everyone to understand that the idea did  
not originate with Mrs. Clinton. ``I don't think it had ever 
occurred to her before a lot of people started calling and asking 
her to do it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he added, in what amounted to an endorsement:  
</P>
<P>
	``It's her decision to make. I will support whatever decision  
she makes enthusiastically. She has a lot of other opportunities 
for public service that will be out there. She and I both would 
like to continue to be useful in public affairs when we leave 
office. But it's a decision she'll have to make. She'd be great if 
she did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few weeks ago, New York Democratic Chairwoman Judith Hope said  
the odds were 50-50 that Mrs. Clinton would run. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is expected to visit New York City in early March  
for a women's leadership forum and some Democrats think she might 
use that setting to give an indication of her intentions. 
</P>
<P>
	New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is a possible Republican  
candidate for the Moynihan seat. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be an incredible race,'' if both the first lady and  
the mayor ran, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Residency requirements vary among states. In New York a  
candidate need only have purchased or rented a residence by 
Election Day to meet residency requirements for purpose of running 
for office, according to Lee Daghlian, spokesman for the state 
Board of Elections. Robert Kennedy was a latecomer to New York when 
he won a Senate seat in 1964.

<HEADLINE> How Impeachment Change Conversation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Around the horseshoe table of Anna Harvey's  
political science class, when talk turns to impeachment, 16 New 
York University students struggle to understand the oddest 
political year of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll look back and see this as a time when the American  
public rejected a myth about the president -- that he was supposed 
to be a hero,'' says Jenny Schwehr, a sophomore from California. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you see is a bleeding of two realms of society into each  
other. There's a socializing of politics and a politicization of 
social life,'' says Lenneal Gardner, a junior from New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	And this, from sophomore Katherine Katsoulakis of New York City:  
``People are going to look back and say, `What happened here?''' 
</P>
<P>
	What indeed? The young adults aren't alone in their confusion.  
As they grapple, so does the nation: People are discussing what 
many have never discussed before. For a year, Americans have 
wrestled, out in the open, over what should be seen, what should be 
discussed, what should be part of the public discourse and what 
should stay private. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, a year after C-SPAN collided with ``As the World Turns,''  
have the events in Washington -- sex, lies, videotape and the public 
airing of it all -- made a lasting mark on the national 
conversation? Will Americans ever view politics, prurience and 
public discourse the same way? 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking about a national dialogue that has been going on  
for the past year. It has a profound effect upon our sociology, our 
psychology, our relationships,'' says Michael Harrison, editor of 
Talkers, a trade magazine for the talk-show industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``This may be changing, irrevocably, the way we talk to one  
another,'' says Roderick P. Hart, a University of Texas-Austin 
professor who studies communication and government. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential sexual scandal has a venerable tradition, from  
Thomas Jefferson and Grover Cleveland through Warren G. Harding and 
Franklin D. Roosevelt to John F. Kennedy. But two things were 
different in President Clinton's case: The public found out much 
more immediately, and the one-two punch of media and Congress made 
sure the whole matter got in the nation's face -- and stayed there. 
</P>
<P>
	This injected into the national dialogue a variety of unfamiliar  
situations. Explicit sexual material began permeating the nightly 
news. Off-color presidential jokes pushed their way into the 
mainstream. The publisher of Hustler magazine became a political 
player. 
</P>
<P>
	One man recounted the awkwardness of oral-sex discussions with  
his octogenarian mother-in-law, and people across the country 
reported similar conversations. In October, Rep. Robert Wexler, 
D-Fla., lamented that Clinton and the Lewinsky scandal ``cheapened 
our national discourse, confused our children, disillusioned our 
idealists and empowered our cynics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, 22 years after Jimmy Carter was castigated for simply  
admitting he looked at women with ``lust in my heart,'' people 
wondered: Have the moral standards of leaders plummeted, or are we 
merely discussing this stuff openly for the first time? 
</P>
<P>
	``The major thing that has changed is that we've pulled back the  
curtain from leadership. And leadership needs that curtain,'' says 
Joe Klein, political writer for The New Yorker and author of 
``Primary Colors,'' the controversial novel based loosely on 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Great leaders are marbled like great steaks. There is fat and  
there is muscle, and the two are intertwined,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	There are other arguments: that the whole mess shoved the  
shadowy interplay between vice and leadership into the public 
arena; that it turned the president into a real person rather than 
an ideal; that it proved the American public is smart enough to 
recognize a person's weaknesses and still deem him capable of 
leading. 
</P>
<P>
	That wasn't the case 11 years ago, when Gary Hart was forced  
from the 1988 presidential race after revelations about an affair. 
Now, attitudes toward public figures' sexual peccadillos have 
evolved into something more calloused or more open-minded, 
depending on your perspective. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has made it easier for any politician, for any public  
figure in the future to have their private sex lives publicly 
exposed and get away with it. The bar has been raised in terms of 
what it will take to shock the public,'' says Larry Tye, the 
biographer of public-relations pioneer Edward Bernays, widely 
considered the father of modern ``spin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So the contradiction remains: a nation of people saying they're  
weary of such matters, then continuing the discussion at every 
turn. People trying to make decisions about their leaders while 
calculating the boundaries of public and private after a wrenching 
year of shifting rhetorical terrain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's as if Clinton has let sex out of the closet. He's  
revealed to us more about ourselves than he ever intended to,'' 
says Kerry Walters, author of a new biography on Benjamin Franklin, 
himself a target of sexual misconduct allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've blended everything up in the same pot, and we don't know  
what to do with it. Pandora's Box has been opened. In terms of the 
`national dialogue,' there's no going back.''

<HEADLINE> Comedian Performs at Fla. College </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- University of North Florida officials  
aren't laughing about a campus performance by comedian Andy Dick. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials say the ``NewsRadio'' star's comedy show included  
vulgar language, sexual innuendo and possible nudity. About 
two-thirds of the audience walked out when Dick pulled down his 
pants during Saturday's performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Police could pursue charges if Dick exposed himself. Students  
assisting Dick backstage say he was wearing a bodystocking. 
</P>
<P>
	Roland Buck, vice president for student affairs, drafted a  
letter Monday to International Creative Management Inc. of New 
York, which manages Dick, to express the school's displeasure. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been reported by witnesses that Dick may have either  
completely exposed himself or that he may have created that 
illusion. In either case, the university community was highly 
offended,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick said he was not upset by the walkout.  
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, it's not for everybody,'' he said. ``People show up  
expecting to see Matthew and see something different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew is the neurotic whiny reporter Dick portrays  
in''NewsRadio,'' a NBC sitcom.

<HEADLINE> Financial Services Deal Starts Mar. 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Nations representing more than 90 percent of the  
world's financial services market agreed Monday that a 
multitrillion-dollar global trade accord should start March 1. 
</P>
<P>
	A key panel of the World Trade Organization decided that the  
financial services agreement, which opens banking, insurance and 
securities markets to international competition, should take effect 
even though 18 countries still have to ratify it. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 52 governments have so far ratified the accord. The 18  
remaining countries have been given until the end of June to 
complete the work which will allow them to join in. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the major trading nations who have come into line are the  
United States, Japan and the countries of the European Union, 
except for Luxembourg which still has to ratify the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Trade officials welcomed the decision and said they were  
confident the other countries ``will come on board as quickly as 
their procedures allow them to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The officials, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity,  
said it is difficult to say how much trade is covered by the 
agreement. When the accord was agreed in December 1997, officials 
estimated there were $1.2 trillion worth of foreign-exchange deals 
done daily. They put total world banking assets at $20 trillion and 
insurance premiums at $2 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
	When the accord was agreed after 15 years of work it was greeted  
by supporters of the WTO as a major step forward in promoting 
worldwide free trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The financial sector worldwide has grown considerably in the  
past 30 years, with jobs in that area representing up to 5 percent 
of total world employment, according to WTO figures. 
</P>
<P>
	United States and European financial services companies  
particularly hope to benefit from freer access to the Asian market.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Nixon Adviser Ehrlichman Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- John D. Ehrlichman, President Nixon's domestic  
affairs adviser who was disgraced and imprisoned for his role in 
the Watergate cover-up that ultimately led to Nixon's resignation, 
has died. He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
	Ehrlichman died Sunday of natural causes at his home in Atlanta.  
He had suffered from diabetes, his son, Tom, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ehrlichman and Nixon's chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman, were  
virtually indistinguishable by the public. Both were close to Nixon 
and they became known as the ``Berlin Wall'' because they 
constituted a kind of palace guard that shielded the reclusive 
Nixon from unwelcome encounters. 
</P>
<P>
	Ehrlichman coined a phrase that became part of the nation's  
political lexicon when he advised Nixon to allow L. Patrick Gray 
3rd, then acting director of the FBI, to become the fall guy for 
Watergate and to leave him ``twisting slowly, slowly in the wind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In April 1973, as the cover-up began to unravel and pressure  
mounted, Nixon held a tearful meeting at his presidential retreat 
at Camp David, Md., with his two intimate and powerful advisers -- 
the iron-willed Haldeman and the self-controlled Ehrlichman. By 
that time, Nixon's counsel, John W. Dean 3rd, had implicated them 
in the Watergate cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, Nixon fired Dean, and accepted the resignations of  
Haldeman, Ehrlichman and Attorney General Richard Kleindienst. 
Nixon hoped that the sacrifices of his closest aides would stanch 
the scandal and spare him. 
</P>
<P>
	The cover-up was the attempt to conceal from the public the  
White House's involvement almost from the start in the break-in at 
Democratic Party headquarters at the Watergate office complex in 
Washington on June 17, 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	The burglars, quickly tied to Nixon's re-election campaign, were  
trying to replace a faulty telephone bugging device installed 
during an earlier break-in. They got caught when a security guard 
noticed they had taped a door to keep it from locking. He removed 
the tape, the burglars replaced it and the guard called the police. 
</P>
<P>
	Nixon won re-election that November but when he was forced by  
the Supreme Court to surrender the tape that showed his own early 
involvement in the cover-up, his impeachment became inevitable and 
a few days later, on Aug. 9, 1974, he became the first and only 
president to resign. His successor, Gerald Ford, pardoned him. 
</P>
<P>
	Ehrlichman went to prison in October 1976 and served 18 months  
of a four to eight year term for obstruction of justice, conspiracy 
and perjury. He lived in Santa Fe, N.M., before and after his 
prison term, wrote ``inside'' political novels and became a radio 
commentator. 
</P>
<P>
	His conviction grew out of his false testimony to a Senate  
committee and of a break-in in the Beverly Hills office of Dr. 
Lewis Fielding, a psychiatrist who had treated Daniel Ellsberg, the 
former Pentagon aide who leaked the Pentagon Papers to The New York 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Haldeman and John D. Mitchell, who had been Nixon's law partner  
and attorney general, also were among those imprisoned for their 
Watergate role. 
</P>
<P>
	``His role in Watergate should always be viewed against the  
historical backdrop of the culture war over Vietnam that was raging 
during the Nixon years,'' John H. Taylor, executive director of the 
Richard Nixon Library &AMP; Birthplace Foundation, said in a statement. 
``President Nixon wrote as follows in his memoirs: `I still believe 
that it is a tragedy of circumstances that ... John Ehrlichman went 
to jail and Daniel Ellsberg went free.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Ehrlichman never seemed able to escape the ghosts of Watergate  
and its effect on the public's impression of him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was never the person everybody saw in the Watergate  
hearings. But I have realized that I was never going to catch up 
with my image. It was set in concrete. It bothered me enormously 
for a while, what people thought of me,'' he told the Washington 
Post in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made myself stop caring because I knew I couldn't do a thing  
about it, and I knew it was going to tear me up if I tried.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview in 1982 to promote his memoir -- ``Witness to  
Power'' -- Ehrlichman minimized his own role in the scandal and said 
Nixon's character kept him from telling the truth about Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a question of weakness,'' Ehrlichman said. ``He simply  
could not bring himself to do something which I think he saw as 
delivering himself to his enemies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Herb Klein, director of communications in Nixon administration  
and now editor in chief of The Copley Newspapers, said: ``John 
Ehrlichman's arrogance in Watergate has become his legacy, but in 
fairness, he should be given credit for the fact that as President 
Nixon's top domestic advisor, he left a major record of school 
desegregation nationally and of progress toward welfare reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ehrlichman was born March 20, 1925, in Tacoma, Wash. He  
graduated from University of California, Los Angeles and got a law 
degree at Stanford University in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
	During World War II, he was a lead navigator in the 8th Air  
Force where he earned the Air Medal clusters and the Distinguished 
Flying Cross. Before joining the White House, Ehrlichman was a 
partner in the Seattle law firm of Hullin, Ehrlichman, Roberts &AMP; 
Hodge from 1952 to 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	Ehrlichman wrote four novels: ``The Company'' 1976; ``The Whole  
Truth'' 1979; ``The China Card'' 1986; (co-author) ``The Rigby 
File'' 1989. He also wrote a memoir which was published in 1983, 
``Witness to Power: The Nixon Years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He eventually moved to Atlanta, where he served as senior vice  
president of Law Environmental, an international engineering and 
environmental regulatory compliance firm. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife, Karen Hilliard, four sons and two  
daughters and his mother, Lillian. Funeral services will be 
private.

<HEADLINE> Book: Mrs. Ramsey Tough With Cops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- JonBenet Ramsey's mother revealed ``the  
hard side of her persona'' when questioned by a detective, leading 
authorities to suspect she was capable of harming her daughter, 
author Lawrence Schiller writes in a new book on the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The book, ``Perfect Murder -- Perfect Town,'' draws on nearly 600  
interviews with key players in the investigation to unveil 
never-before reported details about the unsolved slaying of the 
6-year-old beauty queen. 
</P>
<P>
	After Detective Tom Haney interviewed Patsy Ramsey June 23-25,  
police reviewing a videotape believed he had ``gotten to the real 
Patsy,'' according to excerpts released by Newsweek Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``She had exhibited the hard side of her persona,'' Schiller  
wrote in the book, to be released later this week. ``A side capable 
of bringing harm to her daughter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Haney told Mrs. Ramsey that she had lied to him, Mrs.  
Ramsey replied, ``Pal, you don't want to go there. Don't start 
that,'' Schiller wrote. ``The tougher the questions became, the 
tougher Patsy became.'' 
</P>
<P>
	JonBenet's beaten and strangled body was found Dec. 26, 1996 in  
the basement of the Ramseys' Boulder home, about seven hours after 
Mrs. Ramsey called 911 and said she found a ransom note demanding 
$118,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have said the Ramseys remain under suspicion in  
JonBenet's death, while the Ramseys have repeatedly maintained 
their innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Hal Haddon, who represents JonBenet's parents, declined  
comment Sunday because he had not had a chance to read the book. 
</P>
<P>
	Schiller theorized that JonBenet's killer was familiar with the  
house and knew where the family kept the blanket in which her body 
had been wrapped. 
</P>
<P>
	Schiller also revealed police evidence which was presented to  
District Attorney Alex Hunter on June 1-2, before the interview 
with Haney, according to excerpts of the book printed in the Rocky 
Mountain News of Denver today. 
</P>
<P>
	The police presentation helped convince Hunter to take the case  
to a grand jury, which is now hearing evidence. A spokeswoman for 
Hunter declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The evidence included the Colorado Bureau of Investigation's  
conclusion that four fibers found on the duct tape that had covered 
JonBenet's mouth were consistent with the jacket Mrs. Ramsey wore 
Christmas night, Schiller wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the cord and duct tape used on JonBenet likely had  
been purchased by Mrs. Ramsey at McGuckin hardware store in 
Boulder, he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Police also told Hunter that the fine-line Sharpie pen used to  
write the ransom note was one that Mrs. Ramsey had used before and 
was found in a cup ``right beside the phone in the kitchen where 
Patsy always kept them,'' Schiller wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The author said that some listening to the police presentation  
suspected JonBenet had wet her bed and Mrs. Ramsey had reacted 
violently, accidentally killing her, then she and John Ramsey 
covered it up. 
</P>
<P>
	Schiller, who assisted O.J. Simpson on his book ``I Want to Tell  
You,'' and co-wrote ``American Tragedy: The Uncensored Story of the 
Simpson Defense,'' also worked with Norman Mailer on his Pulitzer 
Prize-winning ``The Executioner's Song.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there will be a resolution to the case,'' Schiller  
said. ``I think all the evidence will come out, but that doesn't 
mean someone will be convicted.''

<HEADLINE> Activists Protest NYPD Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Protesting the shooting by New York City  
police of an unarmed black immigrant, a group of civil rights 
activists called Monday for an examination of police violence 
against blacks nationwide. ``Enough is enough,'' they declared. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got to reign in these officers of the law who are  
killing black people,'' said Rev. Walter Fauntroy, a former 
District of Columbia delegate to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting is being investigated by the Bronx district  
attorney's office, but federal officials are already involved. The 
U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White in New York has begun a separate 
investigation, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation has said it 
is assisting the Bronx attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
	About 400 protesters started outside the White House and then  
marched to the Justice Department and the U.S. Capitol. Federal 
offices were closed for Presidents Day. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to see to it that an end is brought to this police  
violence against people of African-American ancestry,'' said Mark 
Thompson, who chairs an NAACP criminal justice task force. The 
protesters called for stiffer federal laws against police officers 
who target citizens because of their race or ethnic background. 
</P>
<P>
	The protest was sparked by the Feb. 4 fatal shooting of Amadou  
Diallo, from the West African country of Guinea, by New York City 
police officers as he stood in the entrance of his Bronx apartment 
building. 
</P>
<P>
	In Conakry, the Guinean capital, hundreds of people gathered for  
the return of Diallo's body. The body was taken to a hospital 
morgue to prepare first for a funeral on Tuesday in the city's main 
mosque, and then a 270-mile journey on Wednesday to his home 
village of Hollande-Bouroy, in the country's mountainous interior. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too bad that our young have been sacrificed to the spirit  
of violence that runs rampant in the streets of New York,'' 
Interior Minister Zainoul Sanoussi told reporters just before the 
flight touched down. 
</P>
<P>
	At Conakry's Ignace Deen hospital morgue, the Rev. Al Sharpton,  
the New York City black activist who accompanied the family to 
Guinea, told cabinet ministers, ``We promise we will go home and 
fight for justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diallo, whose father is a prominent Guinean trader, was educated  
at private schools in Thailand and Singapore, but was in New York 
working as a street peddler -- hawking videotapes, socks and other 
items from a sidewalk table. 
</P>
<P>
	Four police officers searching for a rapist fired 41 bullets at  
the 22-year-old man as he stood in the vestibule of his New York 
apartment building, hitting him 19 times. The officers involved 
have been placed on administrative non-enforcement duties, but 
still carry their weapons and badges. 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney for the officers has said that police thought Diallo  
was armed.

<HEADLINE> Report Says 'Rust Belt' Is Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- Jim Maloof remembers the ``For Sale'' signs,  
the boarded-up windows and the skyrocketing unemployment here in 
the 1980s. The worst memories, he says, are of the families that 
gave up. 
</P>
<P>
	``People would come in and put the keys to their homes on my  
desk. They'd ask me to take their home, take over their mortgage,'' 
says Maloof, a Realtor who became Peoria's mayor from 1985 to 1997. 
``They couldn't do it. It really broke my heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like dozens of other cities around the industrial Midwest,  
Peoria suffered an economic slowdown in the 1980s so staggering 
that unemployment reached 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Communities including Cleveland, Detroit and Louisville, Ky.,  
also suffered as older industries closed and the region earned 
dubious fame as the ``Rust Belt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But now, some say, the Rust Belt is back.  
</P>
<P>
	A region that was losing jobs and residents a decade ago is on  
the rebound, the Census Bureau reports, as people move back to the 
industrial heartland. 
</P>
<P>
	``In many Rust Belt metro areas, unemployment is down, welfare  
rolls are down, crime is down, wages are up and the population is 
either up or stable,'' the Census Bureau says in a statistical 
report to be officially released today. 
</P>
<P>
	Census analyst Glenn King noted that there is no formal  
definition of Rust Belt and many people would consider it to extend 
into the Northeast and perhaps as far south as parts of Alabama, 
but his report concentrates on the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	King says the reasons for the turnaround vary from community to  
community, with the improved national economy helping a great deal. 
In addition, he says, local growth strategies have been important, 
led by mayors, residents and businesses in different cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michigan, for example, has made a concentrated effort to  
diversify its economy away from being auto dependent,'' he said. 
``That has had a positive impact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In general, the Rust Belt has followed the rest of the country  
in shifting from a goods-based economy to one based on services. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1979, for example, Peoria, a central Illinois city of about  
114,000, had 50,000 people working in manufacturing. Today that 
number hovers around 33,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Area manufacturing, in terms of sheer numbers employed,  
frankly never came back,'' says Bernard Goitein, a business 
professor at Bradley University in Peoria. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of manufacturing, new business growth has been in  
medical and agricultural technology, retail and 
business-to-business industry like computer services and 
advertising, says Bill Browning, president of the Peoria-area 
Economic Development Council. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1980s, the Peoria region suffered a 7.3 percent loss in  
population. Yet in the period from 1990 to 1997, the area saw a 2 
percent gain. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cedar Rapids, Iowa, metro area showed the biggest population  
rebound, from a loss of 0.6 percent in the 1980s to a gain of 7.7 
percent in the period 1990-1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Not far behind were Sioux City, Iowa-Nebraska, turning a 2.1  
percent loss in the '80s to a 5.1 percent gain in this decade; and 
the Detroit-Ann Arbor-Flint, Mich., region which had a 2 percent 
loss in the 1980s and a 4.9 percent gain in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Other metropolitan areas showing strong turnarounds from the  
1980s to the 1990s: 
</P>
<P>
	Louisville, Ky.-Ind., 4.7 percent gain, up from a 0.5 percent  
loss; Jackson, Mich., 3.7 gain, up from 1.1 percent loss; Kokomo, 
Ind., 3.1 percent gain, up from 6.5 percent loss: 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Canton-Massillon, Ohio, 2.2 percent gain, up from 2.6  
percent loss; Peoria-Pekin, Ill., 2.0 percent gain, up from 7.3 
percent loss; Dubuque, Iowa, 2.0 percent gain, up from 7.8 percent 
loss; Davenport-Moline-Rock Island, Iowa-Ill., 1.8 percent gain, up 
from 8.8 percent loss: 
</P>
<P>
	And, Cleveland-Akron, Ohio, 1.7 percent gain, up from 2.7  
percent loss; Parkersburg-Marietta, W.Va.-Ohio, 1.0 percent gain, 
up from 5.5 percent loss; Saginaw-Bay City-Midland, Mich., 0.9 
percent gain, up from 5.3 percent loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Metropolitan areas that continued to lose population in the  
1990s, but at a slower rate than the decade before, included 
Steubenville-Weirton, Ohio-W.Va.; Wheeling, W.Va.-Ohio; Decatur, 
Ill.; Waterloo-Cedar Falls, Iowa; Muncie, Ind.; Youngstown-Warren, 
Ohio; Duluth-Superior, Minn.-Wis.; St. Joseph, Mo.; Benton Harbor, 
Mich. and Toledo, Ohio.

<HEADLINE> Newman, Woodward Appear on Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WESTPORT, Conn. (AP) -- Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward made a  
rare stage appearance to benefit a land trust trying to save 668 
acres of forest from development. 
</P>
<P>
	The two, who have been married 41 years, performed Sunday in  
A.R. Gurney's ``Love Letters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't been on stage since we were wearing furs and  
carrying clubs with spikes,'' Newman joked. 
</P>
<P>
	The appearance at the Westport Country Playhouse raised $175,000  
for the Aspetuck Land Trust, which must raise $12 million by 
September to purchase the land from a water company. 
</P>
<P>
	Newman and Woodward live near the Easton property, in Westport.  
Woodward said their children used to fish in the nearby reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a community like this doesn't protect the few parcels of  
open space now, we'll be kicking ourselves 50 years from now,'' 
Newman said.

abandon a bill aimed at restricting U.S. magazine operations in 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Trade Minister Sergio Marchi, in an interview Monday with  
several American journalists, said the United States was out of 
line in threatening to retaliate against Canadian steel and textile 
exports if the magazine bill is passed. 
</P>
<P>
	Marchi characterized the U.S. attitude as ``I don't like this.  
Let me push you around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's simply not good enough,'' he said. ``You're the only  
superpower left in the world, but you're not the leader of the 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would penalize foreign publishers that sell space to  
Canadian advertisers in special Canadian editions of their 
magazines. Canadian officials and publishers say these so-called 
split-run magazines would take ad revenue away from Canadian 
magazines, offering much cheaper ad rates because their editorial 
costs are covered by their home-country operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Heritage Minister Sheila Copps, who oversees Canada's cultural  
industries, says the bill should be passed by the House of Commons 
by early April. 
</P>
<P>
	She has urged the Americans to offer alternative proposals for  
protecting Canada's magazine industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``But, please, we will not bend to bullies,'' she said in a  
television interview Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and Canadian officials trying to resolve the dispute have a  
third round of talks scheduled for Friday in Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
	Marchi suggested the United States might be reluctant to soften  
its stance because it does not want to set a precedent that would 
encourage other countries to restrict U.S. cultural products. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pop culture is one of the largest exports the Americans  
have,'' Marchi said. ``The Americans are looking at larger field, 
with possibly a slippery slope starting to disrupt this field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of its proximity to the United States, Canada has a  
constant struggle trying to keep its cultural sectors vibrant in 
the face of massive competition from south of the border. Canadian 
films account for less than 5 percent of the national box office, 
and most of the top-rated prime time TV programs are American. 
</P>
<P>
	Marchi said magazines are even more vulnerable than other  
cultural sectors. Canadian singers, he noted, can succeed abroad, 
but Canadian magazines are unlikely to find readers except at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian officials say Canada already has one of the most open  
magazine markets anywhere, with U.S. and other foreign magazines 
accounting for about 80 percent of newsstand sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The pending bill would not prevent such magazines from  
circulating in Canada. It would simply bar Canadian companies from 
advertising in them. The bill would exempt a handful of split-runs 
that have been publishing in Canada for many years, such as the 
Canadian edition Time. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada previously restricted split-runs with a high tax on their  
revenues. That measure was struck down by the World Trade 
Organization in 1997, prompting the government to draft the pending 
bill as an alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	While Canadian publishers strongly support the bill, the  
Association of Canadian Advertisers opposes it as an unwarranted 
restriction of free enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky has denounced the  
bill as ```protectionist and discriminatory.''

<HEADLINE> Windows Users Demand Refunds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOSTER CITY, Calif. -- Hironori Sato grabbed his laptop, his  
digital camera and his modem before heading downtown to take on the 
corporate giants. 
</P>
<P>
	At Microsoft Corp.'s Foster City offices Monday, Sato joined  
about 100 computer users demanding refunds for Windows software 
they say they didn't want to buy and don't plan to use. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm protesting and I'm downloading these images around the  
world,'' said Sato, a computer engineer. 
</P>
<P>
	Around him, demonstrators bearing signs, pagers and laptop  
computers, looked for Microsoft officials to hear their cries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got stuck with this software because I couldn't buy a laptop  
without it,'' said Charles Lingo, a retired maintenance engineer 
from San Jose. ``It's a rip-off by a monopoly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 90 percent of personal computers sold these days come  
pre-loaded with Microsoft's Windows software, which runs all the 
other programs on the computers. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lingo and most of the demonstrators are among a growing  
minority of computer users who don't care for Windows. They have 
chosen to operate their computers with Linux, a system with a 
cherubic penguin mascot that has risen to the forefront among the 
relatively unknown products that can substitute for the Windows 
operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft spokesman Robert Bennett said his company isn't  
forcing anyone to buy Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have the choice of operating systems,'' he said. ``You can  
buy a personal computer with a non-Microsoft operating system, you 
can buy a computer with no operating system at all. Most customers 
choose Windows but you certainly don't have to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that although Microsoft won't give them refunds, they  
could go back to the company that sold them the computer. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not that simple though.  
</P>
<P>
	IBM, Compaq, Acer and other computer companies do not offer  
refunds to customers who aren't going to use the Windows software 
on their machines. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, customer representatives at most major computer  
companies send callers back to Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	``How many rounds of Catch-22 do we have to go through?'' asked  
Eric Raymond, a self-described ``Linux theorist,'' who came to the 
demonstration dressed like Obi-Wan Kenobi from Star Wars. 
</P>
<P>
	Linux was developed in the early 1990s by a Finnish student  
named Linus Torvalds. He wanted to create an operating system for 
PCs that worked like the high-powered operating system Unix, the 
main system used on the big computers that run most of the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	But rather than start a company and market the system, Torvalds  
did something that captured the imagination of programmers around 
the world. Torvalds posted the Linux source code -- the blueprints 
for the software -- on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Linux can still be downloaded for free. It's also sold in a  
commercial version by Durham, N.C.- based Red Hat for $50. The 
system has an estimated 8 million to 9 million users worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, Microsoft closely guards the Windows source code  
and charges about $90 for its operating system. Microsoft's Windows 
and Windows NT operating systems have about 10 times as many users 
as Linux. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft officials served refreshments to the demonstrators on  
the upper deck of their parking lot Monday under an 8-foot banner 
that said: ``Microsoft Welcomes The Linux Community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They said that if the computer makers aren't giving refunds,  
customers could always just take their entire computer back to the 
store where they bought it. 
</P>
<P>
	But dozens of individuals, clutching their brand new Windows  
license agreements, argued that they want the computer. They just 
don't want the software inside. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want your drinks and we don't want your software. We  
want refunds,'' said Raymond.

<HEADLINE> Study: Neanderthals Couldn't Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Could Neanderthals talk?  
</P>
<P>
	That's a question that has scientists challenging each other's  
research and analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists at Duke University reported in April that a bony  
canal in the skulls of Neanderthals indicated they may have had the 
nerve complex needed to control the subtle and varied movement of 
the tongue required for speech. 
</P>
<P>
	But a team from the University of California, Berkeley, is  
challenging that finding in a paper appearing in today's 
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	``We conclude that the size of the hypoglossal canal is not a  
reliable indicator of speech. Therefore the timing of the origin of 
human language and the speech capabilities of Neanderthals remain 
open questions,'' said the California team headed by David DeGusta. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got an interesting point of view and it's stirring the  
pot,'' responded Richard F. Kay, one of the Duke researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If their argument is taken at its face value, we couldn't say  
humans have evolved toward having an increased brain size over the 
last million years,'' he said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The two studies have some similar findings but differ sharply in  
their conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Duke study speculated that Neanderthals might have been able  
to talk, based on findings that the average size of their 
hypoglossal canal was similar to that of modern humans. 
</P>
<P>
	The canal, carrying the nerve that directs the tongue, is  
smaller in apes, which are incapable of complex speech, the Duke 
study found. 
</P>
<P>
	Neanderthals, named for the Neander valley in Germany where  
their remains were first found, evolved around 300,000 years ago. 
If they could talk, it would indicate speech evolved significantly 
earlier than has been thought. Researchers have long believed that 
the ability to make modern human speech sounds did not develop 
until about 40,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	While modern humans came along after the Neanderthal, some may  
have lived at the same time and place as the final generations of 
those early people. 
</P>
<P>
	DeGusta said his Berkeley group tested 30 nonhuman primates,  
compared with just two in the Duke study, and found 15 of them had 
hypoglossal canal sizes larger than humans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because nonhuman primates are not known to speak, their  
hypoglossal canals should be smaller than those in modern humans,'' 
the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``many nonhuman primate specimens have hypoglossal canal  
areas that fall within the range of our modern human sample,'' 
their paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The average gibbon's canal is twice as large as a modern  
humans,'' DeGusta said in a telephone interview, ``so we suggest 
you cannot use canal size'' to indicate the ability to speak. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the Berkeley paper notes that some very ancient hominids  
had average canal sizes close to humans. 
</P>
<P>
	``According to the criteria (of the Duke study) modern human  
speech capabilities originated at least 3.2 million years ago in 
Australopithecus afarensis, a species not previously noted for 
(brain development), symbolic capacity or even stone tool making,'' 
they said. Australopithecus afarensis is the family of the famous 
African fossil Lucy. 
</P>
<P>
	DeGusta said the Berkeley researchers concentrated on the range  
of canal measurements rather than their average, concluding that 
``an individual's ability to speak can depend only on its own canal 
size, not the mean size for its species.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kay defended his group's use of average size by comparing  
studies of brain size in ancient and modern species. 
</P>
<P>
	Modern humans have a brain capacity of about 1,250 cubic  
centimeters (76.3 cubic inches), he said, though in some 
individuals it is as small as 800cc (48.8 cubic inches). By 
comparison the extinct species Homo erectus a million years ago 
averaged about 800cc, with some larger. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are saying, you can say something from this average,'' Kay  
said. The Berkeley researchers' contention that you cannot draw 
conclusions from averages means we ``couldn't say humans have 
evolved toward having an increased brain size over the last million 
years.''

<HEADLINE>  Announcer Jimmy Dudley Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- When Jimmy Dudley was working as an apprentice  
announcer on Chicago Cubs games, his lively, melodious voice caught 
the ear of a major sponsor of Cleveland Indians radio broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the man I want to do the Indians games,'' the chief of  
Erin Brew beer decided in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
	For the next 20 years, Dudley was the voice of the Cleveland  
Indians and greeted fans tuning in on the radio with ``Hello 
baseball fans everywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Dudley died at age 89 after a stroke, said his wife,  
Angie. He suffered from Alzheimer's disease and spent the last two 
years in a special care home in Tucson, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	A gifted storyteller, Dudley covered the Indians from 1948, the  
year the team won its last World Series, until 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	He often used the term, ``The string is out,'' when the count on  
a batter would come to three balls and two strikes. He would end 
his broadcast with, ``Lots of good luck, ya heah,'' his Southern 
voice filled with friendliness. 
</P>
<P>
	In recognition of his work, Dudley was inducted into the  
broadcasters' wing of the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, 
N.Y., in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Dudley, a native of Alexandria, Va., majored in chemistry at the  
University of Virginia. He served as a pilot in the Army Air Corps 
during World War II and then turned to radio broadcasting after the 
war. 
</P>
<P>
	Dudley also did play-by-play for the Cleveland Browns in the  
1950s, for the Baltimore Colts and for Ohio State University 
football games. 
</P>
<P>
	He became the voice of the Seattle Pilots in 1969, but a year  
later, the team transferred to Milwaukee, leaving him behind. 
Dudley never announced a major league game again.

<HEADLINE> IOC Is Seeking Explanations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee is seeking  
explanations from more members implicated in the Salt Lake City 
bribery scandal, an IOC investigator said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacques Rogge, a member of the six-man IOC inquiry commission,  
said the panel held a conference call over the weekend to review 
the report issued last week by the independent Salt Lake ethics 
board. 
</P>
<P>
	The report detailed how IOC members received more than $1  
million in cash, scholarships for their families, medical treatment 
and other favors during Salt Lake's successful bid for the 2002 
Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said letters will ask members to reply by the last week of  
February. The commission then will meet in late February or early 
March and make recommendations to the executive board, which can 
order further expulsions. 
</P>
<P>
	Any expulsions would then go before the full general assembly at  
the March 17-18 emergency session dealing with the worst corruption 
crisis in Olympic history. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake report implicated 24 IOC members -- a fifth of the  
total roster -- for receiving improper or questionable benefits. The 
report cited 10 names that were not included in the list of 14 
implicated earlier during the IOC's internal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	After the IOC panel sent letters demanding explanations from 13  
members (one, Cameroon's Rene Essomba, had died), nine members 
either resigned or were ousted by the executive board. Three others 
remain under investigation, while one received a warning. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said the IOC panel, headed by vice president Dick Pound,  
would follow the same procedure in dealing with new names and 
evidence contained in the Salt Lake report. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone mentioned in the ethics report, except those who have  
already resigned, will receive a letter asking for a reply,'' he 
said in a telephone interview from Belgium. ``They have the right 
to respond in writing or to appear before the commission in 
person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All members implicated in the IOC's original investigation were  
mentioned in the Salt Lake report. Those who have since resigned 
are David Sibandze (Swaziland), Pirjo Haeggman (Finland), Mohamed 
Bashir Attarabulsi (Libya) and Charles Mukora (Kenya). 
</P>
<P>
	Those already investigated by the IOC will receive second  
letters if there is new evidence in the Salt Lake report. That list 
includes the highest-ranking official implicated, South Korean 
executive board member Kim Un-yong, who remained under 
investigation in the initial part of the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said last week the commission would examine new material  
about Kim, including allegations that his son got a 
telecommunications job directly funded by the Salt Lake bid 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim has claimed that the report exonerated him and his son of  
any wrongdoing, and has written a letter to IOC president Juan 
Antonio Samaranch and members of the inquiry panel urging them to 
dismiss the ``scandalous allegations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Members cited for the first time in the Salt Lake report were  
Maj. Gen. Henry E. Olufemi Adefope (Nigeria), Phil Coles 
(Australia), Willi Kaltschmitt (Guatemala), Ashwini Kumar (India), 
Shagdarjav Magwan (Mongolia), Anani Matthia (Togo), Rampaul Ruhee 
(Mauritius), Austin Sealy (Barbados), Siuli Paul Wallwork (Western 
Samoa) and Mohamed Zerguini (Algeria). 
</P>
<P>
	IOC officials have said not all of the additional 10 cases are  
considered serious enough to warrant expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously ordered expelled were Agustin Arroyo (Ecuador),  
Jean-Claude Ganga (Republic of Congo), Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abel 
Gadir (Sudan), Lamine Keita (Mali) and Sergio Santander (Chile). 
</P>
<P>
	The new letters go out at a time when restless corporate Olympic  
sponsors are demanding the IOC carry through with decisive action 
to deal with the crisis or face a rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Payne, the IOC marketing director who felt the wrath of  
sponsors at a meeting in New York last Friday, said the IOC was 
aware of the concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sponsors are saying, `Are you sure you really will deliver  
the cleaning of the house, and the reforms, in March? If this drags 
on beyond March, it impacts on our marketing programs. If we miss 
that March window, it's a big problem,''' Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're telling the sponsors that cleaning the house is the  
first step. That's the line in the sand. Clearly there are things 
that are broken and need to be fixed. This is an opportunity to 
make changes. The IOC has the resolve to go all the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Payne said there was no need for an overnight  
``revolution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Forgotten in all this process is the games per se are  
healthier than they've ever been,'' he said in a phone interview 
from Lausanne, Switzerland. ``That's not totally by accident. You 
have to be careful not to change something which has served you 
under very good stead for 100 years just because someone is 
demanding change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sponsors have been critical of the IOC leadership, while  
stopping short of calling for Samaranch's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have understood that, for the time being, while pushing  
through expulsions and reforms, it would not be helpful to have a 
presidential election,'' Payne said. ``It would destabilize the 
situation. I think that's understood by all of those who closely 
follow the Olympic movement.''

<HEADLINE> Museum Asked to Return Space Parts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) -- A contractor for NASA has asked the U.S.  
Space and Rocket Center museum to return exhibit parts for future 
shuttle launches. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing a lack of parts and funding, Marshall Space Flight Center  
and United Space Alliance asked the center last week to return 
forward assemblies from the solid rocket boosters on the museum's 
full-size shuttle exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't have thought we would have given flight-ready  
hardware,'' Lynne Lowery, community affairs manager at Marshall, 
told Sunday's Huntsville Times. 
</P>
<P>
	The segmented rocket boosters are the largest solid propellant  
motors ever flown, at 149 feet in length and 12 feet in diameter. 
After a shuttle launch, the boosters are designed to separate at 
220,000 feet and parachute back to the ocean. They are recovered 
and refurbished for future flights. 
</P>
<P>
	The forward assembly contains the booster's jettison rockets,  
electronics, recovery parachutes and self-destruct system, among 
other flight instrumentation. 
</P>
<P>
	John Chapman, deputy solid rocket booster project manager at  
Marshall, said the assemblies were designed for repeated use, but 
several have been damaged or lost since the U.S. shuttle program 
began in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would hope folks say the shuttle program is trying to be as  
cost-effective as possible to continue to fly the program,'' 
Chapman said. 
</P>
<P>
	He estimated it would cost about $300,000 for a crane to lower  
the museum's boosters to the ground, remove the forward assemblies, 
restore them to flight-ready condition and build nonflight mockups 
for use in the museum exhibit.

	But it would take three years and cost between $5 million and  
$10 million to find a manufacturer and build new forward 
assemblies. And the Clinton administration's fiscal 2000 request

<HEADLINE> Report: Spielman May Join Browns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Chris Spielman could soon get his wish and  
become a member of the expansion Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	A deal that would send the linebacker from the Buffalo Bills to  
the Browns is in the works and will be announced soon, Columbus 
radio station WTVN and Cleveland radio station WJMI reported Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no word from the Browns. A message seeking comment was  
left for team spokesman Alex Martins. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman, who hasn't played a down in the NFL since 1997, had a  
workout and underwent a physical for the Browns on Friday at the 
team's headquarters in Berea. The Browns were granted permission by 
Buffalo to bring him in. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman, 33, an Ohio high school star at Massillon who later  
starred at Ohio State, missed half the '97 season with a neck 
injury that required surgery to fuse two vertebrae. He then chose 
to sit out this past year to help take care of his two children 
while his wife, Stefanie, was treated for breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Browns coach Chris Palmer said Monday he was impressed with  
Spielman's workout but otherwise couldn't comment on his chances of 
his playing for the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman could not be reached for comment Monday night.  
</P>
<P>
	Last week, he said he would welcome a chance to join the Browns.  
</P>
<P>
	``If Cleveland's the place, that would be great. I'm an Ohio guy  
born and bred,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman has started all 148 NFL games he's played and said he  
wants to remain a starter wherever he's playing.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin's Impeachment Hearings End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- A parliamentary committee seeking to impeach Boris  
Yeltsin finished its work Monday and began preparing a motion to 
remove him from office, a move that is expected to fail. 
</P>
<P>
	Vadim Filimonov, the Communist Party member who led the  
impeachment hearings, said leaders of the parliament's lower house 
will receive the commission's findings Thursday and the entire body 
will probably begin reviewing the motion in two weeks, the Interfax 
news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The impeachment commission, set up last summer, says Yeltsin  
should be held accountable for instigating the 1991 Soviet 
collapse; using force against hard-line lawmakers in 1993; 
launching the botched war in Chechnya; bringing the nation's 
military to ruin; and committing ``genocide'' against the Russian 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	The motion to oust Yeltsin must win a two-thirds majority in the  
lower house, which is considered unlikely. Then it would face the 
Constitutional and Supreme Courts and would have to win passage in 
the upper house of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, Yeltsin dismissed Russia's migration service chief,  
Tatyana Regent; the presidential envoy to several Caucasus regions, 
Pyotr Marchenko; and the head of the State Cinematography 
Committee, Armen Medvedev. 
</P>
<P>
	The presidential press service, which reported the dismissals,  
gave the standard explanations, saying the three were let go at 
their ``own wish,'' to transfer to another job, or for retirement. 
It provided no details. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Deputy Finance Minister Oleg Vyugin said one or two  
experts from the International Monetary Fund will arrive Wednesday, 
despite earlier government statements that a full mission would 
return to Russia this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't rule out the possibility that an IMF mission could  
visit Moscow by the end of the month, but we must work through 
certain budget issues first,'' Vyugin said, according to Interfax. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has urged the IMF to release new loans so that the  
government can pay off part of its massive domestic and foreign 
debts. The IMF has remained noncommittal, demanding that the 
Cabinet approve a viable economic plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Vyugin said the IMF had sent a letter analyzing the government's  
latest economic proposals but refused to comment on its contents. 
The IMF has criticized this year's budget as unrealistic and 
insists the government further cut spending and take stronger 
action to boost revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	It has specifically assailed the government's plan to cut taxes,  
a move intended to help Russia's ailing industries. The IMF said 
the tax cuts would only further erode already scarce revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	In what appeared an attempt to please the IMF, the Finance  
Ministry on Monday said the government would ask parliament to 
delay a planned cut in the value-added tax until as late as July 1.

                          *Victor G. Bloede    	
</P>
<P>
	BOYNTON BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Victor G. Bloede, a former  
advertising executive whose love for words helped create memorable 
campaigns for Maxwell House coffee, Conoco Oil and Crest 
toothpaste, died Wednesday. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Bloede served as chairman and chief executive of Benton &AMP; Bowles  
Advertising, a large international agency he rebuilt during his 33 
years with the company. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined the ad agency in 1950 as a copywriter, worked his way  
up to vice president five years later and became president and 
chief executive by 1968. Three years later he became chairman, a 
position he held until he retired in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Bloede helped introduce the Maxwell House slogan: ``Good to the  
last drop'' and the Conoco Oil slogan: ``The hottest brand going.'' 
He helped Proctor &AMP; Gamble with its ``Please don't squeeze the 
Charmin'' slogan for its toilet tissue and was instrumental in 
helping the company establish Crest as a leading toothpaste. 
</P>
<P>
	Benton &AMP; Bowles later merged with D'Arcy, Masius to become  
D'Arcy, Masius, Benton &AMP; Bowles.

                            *Jaki Byard    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jaki Byard, a pianist, saxophonist and music  
teacher who recorded with modern-jazz artists Charles Mingus and 
Rahasaan Roland Kirk, was found shot dead at his Queens home on 
Thursday. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were investigating the shooting, which went unheard by  
Byard's family members, said one of his two daughters, Denise 
Byard-Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
	Byard's playing spanned the history of jazz. His improvisations  
included boogie-woogie and free jazz with zippy stylistic changes. 
</P>
<P>
	Byard taught for several decades and was instrumental in the  
re-evaluation of jazz history that began in the late 1970s. Early 
in his career he was a big player in the Boston jazz scene. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1960s, Byard began recording with Mingus. He played  
on the classic albums ``Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus'' and 
``The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Duke Ellington became sick just before he died, Byard  
played piano in the Ellington Orchestra.

</P>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Retired Judge Harry A. Cole, the first black to  
serve on the state's highest court and the first elected to the 
state Senate, died Sunday of complications from pneumonia. He was 
78. 
</P>
<P>
	Cole became the first black to win a state Senate seat in 1954.  
In 1977, he was the first black named to the Maryland Court of 
Appeals, where he served until his retirement in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	During his 14-year tenure on the court, Cole wrote the unanimous  
opinion that upheld the right of the state to fund abortions for 
poor women. 
</P>
<P>
	He served in World War II in the Army, serving in Europe and the  
Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	Cole was hired as an assistant state attorney general in 1953,  
becoming the first black lawyer to work in the office. He became 
Maryland's first black state senator by defeating incumbent state 
Sen. Bernard S. Melnicove by 37 votes. He served one term, losing 
by 2,000 votes four years later.

</P>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Jimmy Dudley, the radio voice of the  
Cleveland Indians from 1948, the year the team won its last World 
Series, until 1967, died following a stroke Friday in Tucson, Ariz. 
He was 89 and had Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Dudley was inducted into the broadcasters' wing of the Baseball  
Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	After apprenticing as an announcer for the Chicago Cubs after  
the war, he was hired by the Indians. He also did play-by-play for 
the Cleveland Browns in the 1950s, for the Baltimore Colts and for 
Ohio State University football games. 
</P>
<P>
	He became the voice of the Seattle Pilots in 1969, but a year  
later, the team transferred to Milwaukee, leaving him behind. 
Dudley never announced a major league game again. His wife said his 
last trip to Cleveland was in 1993, when the Indians played their 
final games in Cleveland Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides his wife of 49 years, Angie, Dudley is survived by a  
son, a daughter, two grandchildren and a brother.

</P>
<P>
	TUPELO, Miss. (AP) -- Financial consultant William T. Fields,  
founder of the telecommunications company that evolved into 
industry giant MCI-WorldCom, died Saturday of pancreatic cancer. He 
was 52. 
</P>
<P>
	Fields was best known for his role in founding Long Distance  
Discount Service in June 1984. He was one of nine original 
investors in the company that took advantage of AT&AMP;T's divestiture 
of its Bell companies in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally formed as a telephone equipment company, LDDS soon  
grew into a long-distance company. Fields was named the company's 
first chief executive officer and was chairman of the board. 
</P>
<P>
	After less than a year at the helm, Fields turned over the  
company's operations to a hand-picked successor, Bernie Ebbers. The 
company has since become MCI-WorldCom, which is now second only to 
AT&AMP;T as the world's largest telecommunications company.

</P>
<P>
	O'FALLON, Ill. (AP) -- Bradford Grow, retired pioneer of naval  
aviation and decorated veteran of the Guadalcanal campaign, died 
Thursday. He was 99. 
</P>
<P>
	Grow, a retired rear admiral, graduated from the Naval Academy  
in 1922 and began his flying career four years later. 
</P>
<P>
	A highlight of Grow's aviation career came in 1939, when he led  
a squadron of amphibious planes on a round-trip flight between San 
Diego and Panama without refueling to demonstrate the aircraft's 
capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	During World War II, Grow commanded aircraft carriers, including  
the USS Kasaan Bay and the USS Lexington, in the Pacific and 
European theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	At Guadalcanal, Grow presided over the calm evacuation of the  
USS Wasp as it sank under enemy fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Grow's World War II honors are the Bronze Star, the Legion  
of Merit and the French Croix de Guerre. He retired from the Navy 
in 1952.

                        *Prasit Kanchanawat    	
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Prasit Kanchanawat, a prominent  
politician in the bloody upheaval that rocked Thailand in the 
1970s, died Sunday of cancer. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	A commoner who served in both military and civilian governments,  
Prasit was a lawyer and banker before becoming a member of 
parliament in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	Prasit held several high-level economic posts in the 1960s  
before becoming commerce minister in 1972 under the premiership of 
Field Marshal Thanom Kittakchorn. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanom's government was overthrown in a mass uprising against  
military rule in 1973. A fragile experiment with democracy ensued. 
</P>
<P>
	Prasit was speaker of the first -- though short-lived -- elected  
parliament in 1975. New elections in April 1976 led to Seni Pramoj, 
leader of Thai resistance against Japanese occupation in World War 
II, becoming prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Prasit was justice minister in Seni's government, which fell in  
October 1976 as the military and right-wing extremists massacred 
leftist students and staged a coup. 
</P>
<P>
	The coup ended Prasit's political career. In later years, he 	
served on the board of directors of Bangkok Bank, Thailand's 
largest financial institution.

                            *Max Samter 	
</P>
<P>
	EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) -- Dr. Max Samter, a leader in the treatment  
of people with allergies who was known for his groundbreaking 
textbook on immunology, died Tuesday at the age of 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Samter was the first to recognize that patients who had both  
asthma and nasal polyps, a severe inflammation of the tissue lining 
the nose or sinuses, could have a dangerous reaction to aspirin. 
Such patients are now said to have Samter's syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	Samter was president of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma  
and Immunology in 1958-59 and helped establish the International 
Association of Allergology in the 1950s. He retired from the 
University of Illinois in 1975 but continued to treat patients 
until 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Samter's book, Immunological Diseases, was called the first  
comprehensive text in the field. He wrote it in the 1950s and saw 
it through four editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Samter fled Germany in 1937 after he wrote several short novels  
satirizing the Nazis. He served as a doctor in the U.S. Army during 
World War II, when he developed concussive deafness. 
</P>
<P>
	He was advised to give up any plans for a clinical practice  
because of the ailment, but resumed treating patients when his 
deafness did not progress as quickly as had been feared. 

</P>
<P>
                            *Cecil Smith    	
</P>
<P>
	BOERNE, Texas (AP) -- Cecil Smith, a polo player who won  
virtually every award the sport offers and propelled the 
competition from amateur to international status in a career 
spanning more than six decades, died Jan. 21. He was 94. 
</P>
<P>
	Often referred to by writers as the ``Babe Ruth of polo,'' Smith  
won every major U.S. high-goal tournament of his time. He was 
inducted into the Texas Sports Hall of Fame in 1956 and was one of 
the first six players to be elected to the Polo Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith began his polo career in 1924 in the Texas Hill Country.  
By 1930, he was an alternate on the U.S. international team. In 
1938 and for the next decade, he was a 10-goal player, the sport's 
highest ranking and one achieved by only 20 American-born players. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's 1938 Texas Ranger team was the only foursome to win  
every major tournament in England.

<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Irwin C. ``Watty'' Watson, a comedian and  
musician who appeared in nightclubs and on television, stage and 
cruise ships, died of a heart attack Feb. 1. He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson played at nightclubs around New York City and hotels in  
the Catskill Mountains. Besides the saxophone, he also played 
trumpet, violin, piano and clarinet. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1950s and '60s, Watson frequently appeared on  
television and the stage. He was a comedy star on ``That Was The 
Week That Was'' with David Frost; a regular on the ``Tonight Show'' 
with Johnny Carson; and appeared with Ed Sullivan, Steve Allen, 
Virginia Graham, Mike Douglas and on other shows. 
</P>
<P>
	At various times, Watson was the opening act for stars including  
Sammy Davis Jr., Paul Anka, Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway and Aretha 
Franklin. 
</P>
<P>
	During the last 15 years he entertained on cruise liners  
traveling the world.

<P>
                            *Doug Weston    	
</P>
<P>
	WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Doug Weston, founder of the  
nightclub Troubadour that showcased such folk, rock and comedy acts 
as Joan Baez, Elton John and Lenny Bruce, died Sunday after a short 
battle with pneumonia. He was 72 and had been hospitalized with 
pneumonia since Feb. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Weston prided himself in the acts and audiences he attracted for  
more than four decades, from singer Linda Ronstadt to comedians 
such as the Smothers Brothers and Cheech &AMP; Chong. 
</P>
<P>
	In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Troubadour was considered  
the most consistently important showcase of contemporary folk and 
folk-rock talent in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearances there could guarantee major record sales for new and  
emerging artists. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, the club's acts were consistently impressive:  
the Byrds, Judy Collins, Bill Cosby, the Committee, Bo Diddley, 
Arlo Guthrie, Richie Havens, Gordon Lightfoot, Roger Miller, Joni 
Mitchell, Laura Nyro, Mort Sahl, Kris Kristofferson and Nina 
Simone. 
</P>
<P>
	Weston first set up shop in the 1950s in a 65-seat coffeehouse  
on La Cienega Boulevard. By 1957 he had made enough money to open 
the 300-seat Troubadour in West Hollywood.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines Has Record Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Philippine Airlines reported a record  
loss for the first nine months of its fiscal year and said it plans 
to sell its maintenance and engineering operations to pay off 
creditors and avoid closure. 
</P>
<P>
	PAL reported a net loss Monday of 9.98 billion pesos ($260  
million) in the first nine months of the fiscal year, which ends in 
March, more than double its $124 million loss in the same period a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline blamed the worsening loss on a sharp cutback on  
flight operations, higher financing charges and its temporary 
closure last September because of a labor dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the airline's workers, PAL chief adviser Peter  
Foster said the company is discussing possible layoffs with union 
leaders if the sale of its maintenance and engineering operations 
goes through. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster did not say how much PAL is seeking for its engineering  
division or how many workers would be affected, but another PAL 
official, who asked not to be named, said as many as 1,000 of the 
company's 8,000 workers could be laid off. 
</P>
<P>
	PAL recently averted having most of its jet fleet seized by U.S.  
and European creditors by making an initial payment on debts 
totaling $2.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	A new management also has completed a draft of a revised  
rehabilitation plan, which company officials planned to present to 
U.S. and European creditors in Washington. Further presentations 
are scheduled in Paris on Feb. 22 and in Hong Kong on March 1.

<HEADLINE> Wall St. Celebrates Celebrex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After six months of anticipation, Neil Bodtman  
last week finally got what he wanted most from his arthritis 
doctor: a prescription for Celebrex. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far, so good,'' said Bodtman, five days after starting on  
the pill, the first major new arthritis drug in almost a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Bodtman, 48, of Aberdeen, N.J., is one of thousands of arthritis  
patients who have asked their doctor for the new drug since it was 
introduced Jan. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	This pent-up demand has put Monsanto's Celebrex on track to be  
one of the biggest blockbuster drugs of the year, if not ever. 
</P>
<P>
	In its first three weeks on the market, about 142,000  
prescriptions have been written for Celebrex, according to NDC 
Health Information Services, easily making it the second-fastest 
selling new drug after Pfizer's anti-impotence drug Viagra. The 
previous second-fastest selling new drug was the cholesterol 
treatment Lipitor, which is marketed by Pfizer and Warner-Lambert. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an outstanding rollout,'' said Jack Lamberton, an  
analyst with HSBC Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong early sales come despite little promotion from  
Monsanto, or its co-marketer Pfizer. The companies will officially 
launch the product nationwide next Monday, when they send several 
thousand sales representatives into doctors offices around the 
country. Soon after, they will begin advertising to physicians, and 
eventually directly to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrex relieves pain only about as well as aspirin or other  
anti-inflammatory medications, but what sets the drug apart from 
other painkillers is that it is much less likely to cause severe 
stomach problems such bleeding ulcers, the company and doctors say. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrex costs users about $2.50 a day, or about as much as  
comparable drugs on the market. Analysts expect sales of the drug 
to reach $1 billion this year and $4 billion annually by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	For Monsanto, which last year broke off plans to merge with  
American Home Products, a consumer health products and drug giant, 
Celebrex's brisk sales could not have come at a better time. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Monsanto-AHP breakup, many on Wall Street speculated  
that Monsanto would not be able to prosper without finding a 
partner. Celebrex's success buys the company time, and makes it a 
considerably more attractive player, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously were very pleased with the early prescription data  
on Celebrex,'' said Richard DeSchutter, chief executive officer of 
Monsanto's drug division, Searle. ``We are getting more optimistic 
by the day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Monsanto still faces some stiff challenges if it wants to  
ride Celebrex into pharmaceutical sales history. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck, the world's largest drug company, is expected to get  
government approval for a similar arthritis drug by June. And Merck 
is hoping its Vioxx drug gets approval not just for arthritis pain, 
but as an overall painkiller. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck also wants to convince the Food and Drug Administration  
that its drug is superior to Celebrex, and thus not have to place 
any warning about gastrointestinal effects on its label. Monsanto 
is also working on persuading the FDA to revise its warning label 
and allow it to be marketed for fighting pain other than arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Monsanto faces the obstacle of getting health  
insurers, which have become more stingy in paying for new drugs, to 
cover Celebrex. Aetna-U.S. Healthcare, one of the nation's largest 
managed-care plans, said it will cover the pill's cost only for 
patients that show an intolerance for other arthritis medications. 
</P>
<P>
	United HealthCare, another managed-care company, said if its  
members want it they have to pay more out of pocket for it. Both 
insurers say they have yet to complete scientific reviews of the 
drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Celebrex will increasingly be compared with Viagra for  
its fast start, Celebrex is likely to fare better over the long 
run, analysts say. That's because most users take Viagra only 
periodically. Arthritis patients take Celebrex and other drugs 
virtually every day, and often once they start on a pill, they take 
it for life. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Sudol, of Sleepy Hollow, N.Y., has taken medications for his  
rheumatoid arthritis for 30 years. He heard about Celebrex last 
week on television, and immediately asked his doctor if he could 
try it. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Sudol has suffered no stomach problems from the other  
anti-inflammatory drugs, he also takes an ulcer medication just in 
case. By taking Celebrex, Sudol said, he could stop taking the 
ulcer medication and feel more confident that he is not hurting his 
stomach to relieve his arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Its all about quality of life,'' Sudol said. ``I'm 53 and  
hopefully I'll be around to see 73.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sudol's physician, Dr. Ted Fields, a rheumatologist at the  
Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, said many of his patients 
have already heard of Celebrex before he offers a free sample or 
prescription. ``There's a huge pressure for it.''

<HEADLINE> The Donnas Are the New Divas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Get ready for four teen divas known simply  
as the Donnas. 
</P>
<P>
	After some exposure on MTV for last year's album ``American  
Teenage Rock 'n' Roll Machine,'' they appear as an all-girl 
bubblegum group in the black comedy ``Jawbreaker,'' which stars 
rocker Marilyn Manson and his girlfriend, Rose McGowan. Another 
movie is already in the works. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people see us as a teen band,'' said guitarist Donna  
R. with a shrug. ``It's nice to do a movie, even if you're 
typecast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	None of the young Palo Alto High School graduates -- the two  
oldest have recently turned 20 -- are actually named Donna. The 
band's new record, ``Get Skintight,'' is due in June. The San 
Francisco Chronicle described their songs as ``excitable anthems 
for juvenile delinquents.''

<HEADLINE> Penn. Bridges Can Salt Themselves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRWIN, Pa. (AP) -- If everything works right, motorists will  
never have to wait for road crews to salt three bridges in western 
Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	Before snow falls on any of the overpasses, weather sensors will  
anticipate the precipitation and spray the roads with magnesium 
chloride, which is essentially liquid salt. 
</P>
<P>
	The spray should save time for road crews and keep the roadways  
clear for drivers. A bridge generally freezes faster than a road 
because cold air passes both above and beneath the span. 
</P>
<P>
	The de-icing systems on the Pennsylvania bridges are the only  
three of their kind in the United States, said Mike Strobel, who 
spent Monday putting the finishing touches on the U.S. Route 30 
overpass near Irwin, about 15 miles southeast of Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	If the sensors and low-lying salters work, Pennsylvania  
Department of Transportation officials plan to use them around the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the future,'' said Strobel, manager of the project for  
Boschung Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The Route 30 equipment passed its first test Sunday night. A  
second bridge has had the technology for about two weeks and work 
on a third bridge should be complete in the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
	The equipment for all three bridges cost about $550,000,  
Transportation Department spokesman Steve Chizmar said. 
</P>
<P>
	The handful of other U.S. bridges with salt sprayers have  
equipment that is activated by people, Chizmar said. The 
Pennsylvania bridges are unique because they work without human 
help, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	One set of sensors tracks air temperature, wind speed and  
direction, humidity and other weather data, Chizmar said. Other 
sensors measure the pavement temperature and calculate how much 
salt is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology has been used for years in parts of Europe, said  
Strobel, whose company is based in Switzerland.

<HEADLINE> Diet May Prevent 2nd Heart Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A Mediterranean-style diet high in fruits,  
vegetables, fish and beans -- already proven to reduce the risk of 
cancer -- may also protect people from suffering a second heart 
attack, a study shows. 
</P>
<P>
	A study of more than 400 men and women over nearly four years  
found that people who eat these kinds of foods are 50 to 70 percent 
less likely to suffer repeat heart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``By making some simple dietary changes that are easy to  
understand and easy to follow, a person can improve his or her 
chances of avoiding a second heart attack and having a better 
quality of life,'' said Dr. Michel de Lorgeril, who led the French 
project known as the Lyon Diet Heart Study. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings were published Monday in Circulation, the journal  
of the American Heart Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The patients, all of whom had suffered one heart attack, were  
similar in body fat, blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels, 
and about one-fifth of each group continued to smoke. After an 
initial heart attack, each study subject was put on one of two 
diets. 
</P>
<P>
	About half the group ate a ``Western'' diet that averaged almost  
34 percent of total calories from fat and almost 12 percent of 
calories from saturated fat. The study did not further identify the 
diet. The diet of the other half averaged 30 percent of total 
calories from fat and 8 percent from saturated fat. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, the same researchers found that participants who  
followed a Mediterranean diet faced a 56 percent lower risk of 
dying during the study period, and a 61 percent lower risk of 
developing cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Ronald Krauss, head of molecular medicine at Lawrence  
Berkeley National Laboratory at the University of California at 
Berkeley, said the French study is one of several over the years 
that show it's possible to reduce the risk of heart disease or 
recurrent heart disease using dietary means. 
</P>
<P>
	``It supports the overall recommendations we've made for years  
regarding the importance of a diet that is low in saturated fats 
and rich in fruits, vegetables and fibers,'' said Krauss, who was 
not involved with the Lyon study. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Dean Ornish, a professor of medicine at the University of  
California, San Francisco, said an Asian diet is healthier than 
either Western or Mediterranean fare. He led a group that published 
a dietary study in December.

<HEADLINE> Study: Neanderthals Couldn't Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- California researchers are challenging a study  
that raised the possibility that Neanderthals could talk. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke University scientists reported in April that a bony canal  
in the skulls of Neanderthals indicates they may have had the nerve 
complex needed to control the subtle and varied movement of the 
tongue required for speech. 
</P>
<P>
	A paper appearing in Tuesday's Proceedings of the National  
Academy of Sciences questions that finding. 
</P>
<P>
	``The size of the hypoglossal canal is not a reliable indicator  
of speech. Therefore the timing of the origin of human language and 
the speech capabilities of Neanderthals remain open questions,'' 
said the team headed by David DeGusta of the University of 
California at Berkeley. responded Richard F. Kay, one of the Duke 
researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard F. Kay, one of the Duke researchers, responded,  
``They've got an interesting point of view and it's stirring the 
pot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If their argument is taken at its face value, we couldn't say  
humans have evolved toward having an increased brain size over the 
last million years,'' he said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The two studies have some similar findings but differ sharply in  
their conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Duke study speculated that Neanderthals might have been able  
to talk, based on findings that the average size of their 
hypoglossal canal was similar to that of modern humans. 
</P>
<P>
	The canal, carrying the nerve that directs the tongue, is  
smaller in apes, which are incapable of complex speech, the Duke 
study found. 
</P>
<P>
	Neanderthals, named for the Neander valley in Germany where  
their remains were first found, evolved around 300,000 years ago. 
If they could talk, it would indicate speech evolved significantly 
earlier than has been thought. Researchers have long believed that 
the ability to make modern human speech sounds did not develop 
until about 40,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	While modern humans came along after the Neanderthal, some may  
have lived at the same time and place as the final generations of 
those early people. 
</P>
<P>
	DeGusta said his Berkeley group tested 30 nonhuman primates,  
compared to just two in the Duke study, and found 15 of them had 
hypoglossal canal sizes larger than humans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because nonhuman primates are not known to speak, their  
hypoglossal canals should be smaller than those in modern humans,'' 
the researchers said. But ``many nonhuman primate specimens have 
hypoglossal canal areas that fall within the range of our modern 
human sample.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The average gibbon's canal is twice as large as a modern  
human's ...'' DeGusta said in a telephone interview, ``so we 
suggest you cannot use canal size'' to indicate the ability to 
speak. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed the Berkeley paper notes that some very ancient hominids  
had average canal sizes close to humans. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the criteria of the Duke study, ``modern human  
speech capabilities originated at least 3.2 million years ago in 
Australopithecus afarensis, a species not previously noted for 
(brain development), symbolic capacity or even stone tool making,'' 
they said. Australopithecus afarensis is the family of the famous 
African fossil Lucy. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Berkeley researchers concentrated on the range of  
canal measurements rather than their average, concluding that ``an 
individual's ability to speak can depend only on its own canal 
size, not the mean size for its species.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kay defended his group's use of average size by comparing  
studies of brain size in ancient and modern species. 
</P>
<P>
	Modern humans have a brain capacity of about 1,250 cubic  
centimeters, he said, though in some individuals it is as small as 
800 cc. By comparison the extinct species Homo erectus a million 
years ago averaged about 800 cc, with some larger. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can say something from this average,'' Kay said. The  
Berkeley researchers contention that you cannot draw conclusions 
from averages means we ``couldn't say humans have evolved toward 
having an increased brain size over the last million years,'' he 
added.

<HEADLINE> Farming Economy Won't See Quick Fix / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAND ISLAND, Neb. (AP) -- Farmers struggling to make a living  
despite low crop prices cannot hope for a quick economic 
turnaround, an Agriculture Department economist says. 
</P>
<P>
	Keith Collins, the department's chief economist, told a U.S.  
House Agriculture Committee field hearing Monday that little 
improvement in the farm economy is expected this year because of 
high crop yields and weak export demand. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee's chairman, Rep. Larry Combest, R-Texas, said his  
panel would seek changes in crop insurance coverage to better 
protect against low prices and natural disasters like drought. 
Combest also wants to include livestock in federally supported farm 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Increased government assistance helped maintain farm income in  
1998 as export demand weakened in Asia and record yields depressed 
prices, Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
	But areas of the country that weathered difficulties last year,  
including the Corn Belt of the Midwest, probably will be hurt in 
1999, Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Over a two- to four-year period, economic recession in Asia  
should give way to economic recovery, increasing demand for U.S. 
farm products and improving farm incomes, Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Nebraska, economists predicted that up to 20 percent of the  
state's farmers would be out of business in the next two years if 
commodity prices remained low. 
</P>
<P>
	In Iowa, one study predicted as many as one-third of that  
state's farmers could be forced to restructure or liquidate if low 
farm prices continued through 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	There appeared to be little support, even among producers who  
testified, for returning to price supports that carried agriculture 
programs until the GOP-driven Freedom to Farm Act passed in 1996. 
That farm law weaned farmers away from price supports in exchange 
for more freedom to plant what they want. 
</P>
<P>
	The Freedom to Farm law received its first test last year as  
crop prices plummeted, and Congress responded to the farm crisis 
with more than $6 billion in emergency farm aid. There were calls 
by some Democrats for a return to price supports. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Kepler, a wheat and corn farmer in Nebraska's Panhandle,  
said he supports changes in the crop insurance program. 
</P>
<P>
	``An improved crop insurance program will stand as a firm  
foundation for future farm policy,'' said Kepler. ``As American 
farmers, we greatly need an economical insurance policy that will 
be tied to lost income as well as lost production.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the hearing, which spanned issues across the agricultural  
spectrum, several livestock producers called for mandatory price 
reporting for meatpacking companies and warned that increased 
consolidation of agriculture into large corporations will hurt the 
family farmer -- and the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``We, as family farmers, care about the food we are producing,''  
said Scott VanderWal, a cattle and grain farmer from Volga, S.D. 
``If you take your crystal ball out and look out 20 years, you find 
two corporations handling the nation's food, and prices go up and 
quality goes down.''

<HEADLINE>  3 Designers Take Center Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Three things count in the business of fashion:  
timing, timing, timing. 
</P>
<P>
	That is why American designers are staging their fall Fashion  
Week previews six weeks earlier than usual. 
</P>
<P>
	Fall in February? What's the hurry?  
</P>
<P>
	Ask nearly any designer here: It's good to be the early bird.  
The unprecedented jump-start was prompted by an itch to leapfrog in 
front of the London, Paris and Milan shows. Those fashion capitals 
normally play a gig of openings for an international audience of 
retailers, editors and photographers before sending the weary 
traveling circus packing for the openings here. 
</P>
<P>
	Designers stateside say they want to be judged without being  
compared to the rest of the pack. Besides, they say, having second 
billing typically means receiving more accusations of copying the 
front-runners, having less time for production and delivery, and 
fewer dollars for the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a slight puffing of the chest, now that Americans can  
compete on a world level and didn't have to be last in the ring of 
shows,'' says Stan Herman, president of 7th on Sixth, which 
coordinates Fashion Week. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the nearly 80 semiannual previews are centralized at  
tents at Bryant Park, a bit of midtown greenery behind the New York 
Public Library. On Monday, fashion fans gathered there to glimpse 
the glamour gowns of Caracas-born Carolina Herrera, celebrated for 
having dressed Hillary Clinton, Jacqueline Kennedy and Whitney 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are so many occasions, especially in New York, no?''  
says Herrera. That's why she stands ready to lavish her customers 
with pullover sweaters made entirely of mink, dresses fairly 
dripping in ostrich and mohair skirts spangled with sequins. 
</P>
<P>
	But not everything on the runways is for ladies of renown. Or  
for ladies at all. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, both women's and men's shows have been  
consolidated into the Fashion Week schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	At some shows, the runway is coed. Sunday's curtain-raiser, for  
example, was Donna Karan's DKNY line of men's and women's clothes 
built for comfort. DKNY, which runs about 50 percent below the 
price of Donna Karan collection, puts a sporty spin on sportswear. 
</P>
<P>
	For women, there are baggy ``cotton slip cover duvet'' coats,  
which indeed resemble down-filled comforters. For men, the line 
offers hoods, wool cargo pants and drawstrings on nylon pullovers 
to underscore the athletic influence. 
</P>
<P>
	Cynthia Rowley, who showed Sunday at Grand Central Terminal, was  
headed for more exotic destinations. ``I have cashmere sweaters 
from Mongolia, sequins from Paris and beading from India,'' she 
said of her embellished women's wear. Even men's snowboard pants 
were teamed with sparkly mohair sweaters. 
</P>
<P>
	But some outfits were sparse, most notably the one worn by  
``Cabaret'' star Alan Cumming, who ended the show bare-chested, in 
a red taffeta ball skirt. He still didn't look quite as fetching as 
front row members Salma Hayek, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Natasha 
Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	This season's New York schedule was prompted by German designer  
Helmut Lang. His decision to relocate here and show early during 
last fall's round of Fashion Week created a domino effect, 
inspiring a dozen American designers to likewise jump the gun. 
</P>
<P>
	But not every New York designer is here. Bill Blass and Geoffrey  
Beene are showing in April. Both cite late fabric deliveries. 
Blass' delay also stems from his December hospitalization following 
a mild stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	But in one crucial context, being last has its distinctions:  
This week's previews represent fall 1999/winter 2000 -- the final 
collections of the millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	The collections wrap up Friday with Calvin Klein.  
</P>
<P>
	What's next on the fashion roster?  
</P>
<P>
	``With so much change, it is hard to know who is going to  
leapfrog next over whom,'' says Herman. 
</P>
<P>
	He's hardly the only one speculating.  
</P>
<P>
	``In the future,'' says New York designer Randolph Duke, ``we  
may be looking at fashion two years ahead. I could see it 
happening. Like, I could be working now on my collection for 2004 
and saying, `I'm seeing pink.'''

	But not every New York designer is here. Bill Blass and Geoffrey

	``In the future,'' says New York designer Randolph Duke, ``we

<HEADLINE> Polls Powerful in Impeachment Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky and President Clinton's  
impeachment put the spotlight on polls and the pressure on 
pollsters as never before, and public opinion proved powerful. 
</P>
<P>
	When news of the investigation by Independent Counsel Kenneth  
Starr of the president's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky broke in 
January 1998, several political analysts said Clinton would never 
survive politically. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, some predicted the public would turn on the president  
once the accusations were proven true. By fall, many forecast the 
Republicans would steamroll Democrats in November's congressional 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The American public had other ideas.  
</P>
<P>
	They gave the president some of the highest job approval ratings  
of his presidency, in the 60s through much of the year as the 
economy flourished. And a solid majority opposed his removal. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was one of the strongest reaffirmations of democracy I  
have seen,'' said Colorado Gov. Roy Romer, general chairman of the 
Democratic Party. ``People got it right, got it early and they 
stayed with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At first, many people were skeptical about the charges against  
Clinton, but about half said he should be impeached if he lied 
under oath about his affair with Ms. Lewinsky. Later, the number in 
favor of impeachment settled at about one in three. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollsters repeated their questions frequently, anticipating that  
people would turn against the president at some point. 
</P>
<P>
	It never happened.  
</P>
<P>
	Republicans had a tougher year. They lost five House seats in  
mid-term elections. House Speaker Newt Gingrich resigned. Then Rep. 
Bob Livingston, the speaker-designate, quit after his own 
infidelity was disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	The year was humbling for pundits and pollsters too, Republican  
pollster Bill McInturff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Who would have guessed a year ago, he said, that ``the president  
wouldn't be removed but it would wipe out the Republican 
leadership?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In general, the American electorate has shown a tolerance for  
personal behavior,'' McInturff added, ``that is far wider and 
broader than I would have imagined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Republicans pushed ahead with impeachment, they repeatedly  
said the polls were not a principal concern. But Republicans found 
some poll results worth noting, citing results that highlighted the 
majority of Americans who thought Clinton lied under oath and 
didn't trust him personally. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been too much focus on the polls and not enough on  
what's right and on principle,'' said Republican National Committee 
spokesman Mike Collins. ``If we were interested in doing the 
political thing, we would have dropped this months ago. We were 
following principle and doing our duty under the Constitution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The polls proved powerful because they gave a clear and  
recurring message, said Robert Shapiro, a Columbia University 
political scientist who studies public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Different organizations were asking the same kinds of  
questions and finding the same patterns and trends,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the president's ratings on handling of his job were low or  
the economy had gone bad, ``he'd be gone,'' Shapiro said. 
</P>
<P>
	By the closing days of the impeachment process, some Republicans  
acknowledged their unsuccessful bid to oust Clinton had hurt them 
in the polls. But they predicted they would have time to recover 
and focus on tax cuts and other popular issues before the 2000 
elections.

	Clinton Meets With Mexico's Zedillo  
</P>
<P>
	MERIDA, Mexico (AP) -- President Clinton and Mexican President  
Ernesto Zedillo met today to discuss such things as trade and drugs 
just two weeks before Clinton must make a formal evaluation of 
Mexico's cooperation in trying to shut down the narcotics trade. 
Answering Mexican and U.S. congressional complaints that the 
current process is vague, one-sided and political, Clinton and 
Zedillo outlined today 16 measures -- including U.S. demands for a 
reduction in drugs and extraditions by Mexico -- by which 
performance will be judged. On another subject, with the 
impeachment cloud lifted, Clinton said he would seek cooperation 
with Republicans in Congress who tried to remove him from office.

	U.S. Warplanes Strike Sites in Iraq  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. warplanes struck at Iraqi defense sites  
on two separate occasions today, responding to Iraqi challenges in 
the northern ``no fly'' zone, a Defense Department spokesman said. 
Two F-15E's were fired upon by an antiaircraft artillery site north 
of Mosul, which is some 250 miles north of Baghdad, Lt. Col. Steve 
Campbell said. In response, one of the fighter planes dropped a 
500-pound bomb on the site. The fighter planes returned undamaged 
to their base in Incirlik, southern Turkey, U.S. officials said. In 
a separate confrontation, another U.S. warplane launched a missile 
at an Iraqi radar site that had targeted it about an hour later, 
Campbell said.

	Britain Artillery Slated for Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- The British army began moving military  
vehicles and heavy guns from Germany to Greece today for use in a 
possible NATO intervention in Kosovo. About 400 vehicles, including 
tanks and armored infantry vehicles, were loaded onto ferries in 
the northern port of Emden for transport to Thessalonika, the army 
said. Meanwhile, outside Paris, where talks to try to end the 
Serbian-Kosovo Albanian fighting, the United States and five other 
nations have given rival Serbs and ethnic Albanians until noon 
Saturday to consider a plan for ending yearlong conflict, Kosovo, 
but hurdles remain.

<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- American Airlines officials think they might  
resume regular service as early as tomorrow as more and more pilots 
end their sick-out. About 800 of American's 9,400 pilots were still 
listed as sick today, compared to the nearly 2,500 who declared 
themselves unfit to fly Thursday and Friday, American officials 
said. However, about 250 -- or roughly 11 percent -- of the 2,250 
flights scheduled for today have been canceled because some pilots 
weren't immediately available for flying.

today for a longshot presidential campaign based on returning 
``power to the people.'' A crowd of 300 turned out in his adopted

Laidoni was arrested at Paris' Gare du Nord train station on Jan. 
18 by members of France's internal security service, known as the 
DST. He was charged with criminal association with a terrorist 
enterprise, police and judicial sources said. The sources spoke on

<HEADLINE> Mike Utley Takes a Few Giant Steps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- For the first time since he lay paralyzed on the  
Pontiac Silverdome turf seven years ago, Mike Utley stood in public 
Monday and took a few wobbly steps. 
</P>
<P>
	``By standing up, you feel who you are,'' he said. ``I was 315  
pounds and 6-foot-6. I was proud to be as big as I was. I was proud 
to be as tall as I am. I want it back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Towering over everyone as he did so long ago, wearing a Detroit  
Lions T-shirt, the former offensive lineman made it a few feet down 
a wooden walkway, painfully swinging one leg ahead, then the other. 
</P>
<P>
	He wore lower leg braces to keep his ankles from rolling. A  
friend steadied him on each side. He grimaced as he took each 
excruciating step, his girlfriend Dani Andersen helping him by 
making sure his spindly lower legs stayed straight. 
</P>
<P>
	A couple of times, his legs gave way, and the two buddies on  
each side, retired NFL center Bill Lewis and Lions linebacker Rob 
Frederickson, had to catch him. 
</P>
<P>
	But he made it 10 feet or so.  
</P>
<P>
	``Whew! I'd rather go through double days than that,'' he said  
afterward. ``No, it's exhilarating. Seven years is a long time to 
be sitting in this chair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His sense of humor, a major ally throughout his struggle, was on  
display, too. 
</P>
<P>
	As Utley stood poised for this high drama, a cell phone rang.  
</P>
<P>
	``Dominos,'' he said, imitating the guy who answers at the pizza  
place. 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone laughed.  
</P>
<P>
	Then it was back to business, as it has been every tough day  
since that horrifying moment on Nov. 17, 1991, in the Lions' home 
game against the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	He knew immediately the injury was serious. Two of his vertebrae  
had been crushed. As he was carried off the field, he gave the 
crowd a ``thumbs up'' gesture. 
</P>
<P>
	It's become his trademark, and Utley has come to symbolize grit,  
determination and optimism in the face of grim odds. He vows to 
someday walk off the field from the spot he was injured. He talked 
Monday of someday walking his mom three blocks from her home to 
church. 
</P>
<P>
	He's a long way from that, but those steps in front of a crowd  
of reporters and photographers in a Phoenix hotel conference room 
were an emotional triumph nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was awesome to see him up there,'' Lewis said. ``Yesterday  
when we rehearsed, I was practically in tears. It's nothing short 
of miraculous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Utley, 33, is paralyzed from the chest and elbows down. His  
upper arms still are the bulging biceps of a football lineman. But 
he has only partial control of his hands and lower arms. About two 
years ago, he began to feel some sensations in his legs. He can 
feel his toes, describing it as the way you'd feel on an extremely 
cold day. 
</P>
<P>
	He began working with biofeedback, trying to identify the  
connection between his brain and those few alive nerves in his 
legs. He kept up daily, grueling physical therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rehabilitation is a lifestyle,'' he said. ``It's not something  
you just do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A major reason for his public display, and the pressure that  
came with it, on Monday was his desire to raise more money for his 
Mike Utley Foundation, dedicated research aimed at finding a cure 
for spinal cord injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Utley was quick to point out that no two spinal cord injuries  
are the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing you can control is your mind,'' he said. ``I'm  
not saying everyone will get as far as I've gotten. But they can do 
something today they didn't do yesterday. Maybe they can go 
outside. Maybe they can wheel themselves around the block, and 
maybe tomorrow they can do two blocks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Utley credits his positive attitude for everything he has  
accomplished, whether it be snow skiing, scuba diving, driving his 
specially equipped van or taking those few steps. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good start,'' he said of his effort Monday. ``Is it the  
finish line? Not even close? Will I continue on? Will I walk again? 
You betcha. ... I've taken a few more steps before, but I've never 
gone this far. I want to walk off that Silverdome, and one day I 
will. It might not be tomorrow, but someday I will. I guarantee 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors, who once told him he'd never walk again, now look on  
Utley as a great asset. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives their new patients hope,'' Utley said. ``If you take  
hope away, if you take dreams away, you lose them forever. But it 
goes back to the person. If you're a champion before you got hurt, 
you're a champion now. But you have to work at it. You have to have 
goals. I will never be number two, not today, not tomorrow, not 
ever. Why? Because I believe in myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He talked of going to hospitals to visit children stricken by  
paralyzing injuries, seeing their family's in pain and solidifying 
his determination to find a cure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to see moms and dads cry anymore,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Before he rose for that moment on his feet, he explained why he  
had decided to take these steps publicly. He wanted to show 
doctors, insurance companies and the health industry in general 
that rehabilitation is a lifelong process, something a seriously 
injured person needs to do until he dies. 
</P>
<P>
	And there was a more personal reason.  
</P>
<P>
	``I want to do it for my family and the people who have given me  
support from the first day when I came off that field and gave that 
thumbs up,'' he said, ``everyone in the Detroit organization, the 
friends I've made since I've been hurt. I will show them that I 
have never quit. I will never quit until I am completely free of 
this spinal cord injury.''

<HEADLINE> Duke Stays No. 1 in AP Hoops Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Duke, Connecticut and Auburn held the top three spots in the AP  
college basketball poll Monday. Then came changes galore following 
losses by 10 ranked teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils (25-1) stayed a resounding No. 1, receiving 64  
first-place votes and 1,744 points from the national media panel 
after breaking the 100-point mark twice and winning by an average 
of 38.5 points in their two games last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut (22-1), which also won twice last week, got the  
other six No. 1 votes and 1,677 points, 72 more than Auburn (24-1), 
which also went 2-0 last week, winning by an average of 35 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State moved up one spot to fourth, and Maryland and  
Kentucky each jumped two places to fifth and sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford, which beat then-No. 9 UCLA and lost to Southern  
California, dropped from sixth to seventh, while Arizona moved up 
two places No. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati, which lost to Marquette and Saint Louis last week  
and is on a three-game losing streak, fell from fourth to No. 9, 
its lowest ranking since jumping to sixth in late November after 
beating then-No. 1 Duke in the Great Alaska Shootout. 
</P>
<P>
	St. John's moved up one place to round out the Top Ten.  
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State moved from No. 13 to 11th, the Buckeyes' highest  
ranking since being No. 3 in the final poll of the 1991-92 season. 
They were followed by Utah, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Miami, UCLA, 
Purdue, College of Charleston, Indiana and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The last five teams in the poll were Syracuse, Missouri,  
Florida, New Mexico and Miami of Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri and Miami of Ohio both returned to the rankings for the  
second time this season, while Minnesota and Kansas dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers (18-5) were 24th two weeks ago, their first poll  
appearance since December 1995, but dropped out following a loss to 
Nebraska. They return after victories over Iowa State and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami of Ohio (19-4) was ranked in the second and third polls of  
the regular season, but dropped out following losses to Xavier and 
Wisconsin-Green Bay. The RedHawks, who hadn't been ranked since the 
final poll of the 1977-78 season, returned to the Top 25 having won 
seven straight and 12 of 13. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the first time since the AP poll began in 1949 that both  
Miamis were ranked at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota (14-8) fell out from 22nd after losing last week to  
Iowa and Michigan State. The Golden Gophers had joined the Top 25 
in the fourth poll of the season and had gotten as high as No. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas (16-8), which had been No. 24, lost to Nebraska and Texas  
Tech last week to drop out after returning from a one-week absence. 
The Jayhawks had been ranked in every poll for the previous eight 
years before dropping out the first time this season. 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA, which took the week's biggest fall in dropping from No. 9  
to 16th, was the fourth ranked team to lose two games last week, 
losing to Stanford and California.

<HEADLINE> Epic Honor Wins Golden State Mile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN MATEO, Calif. (AP) -- Epic Honor had no room to run on the  
far turn. Instead, the colt found some in the stretch, getting the 
lead with an explosive move to win Monday's $100,000 Golden State 
Mile at Bay Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
	``He finished like gangbusters! I think we'll move on to the  
list of Kentucky Derby contenders now,'' said Phil Lebherz, a 
co-owner of the 3-year-old Epic Honor. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinned between horses at the three-eighths pole, Epic Honor's  
jockey, Lonnie Meche, had to pull back the reins and check him, 
forcing the colt to lose momentum. 
</P>
<P>
	Meche then altered course, dropping from the outside to the  
rail, where he squeezed past tiring horses before an astonishing 
burst carried him past pacesetting Brave Gun for a three-length 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact he was able to get stood up on his ear, regroup and  
come back to win was the most impressive part of the race to me,'' 
said Jeff Bonde, Epic Honor's trainer. ``He's showing more and more 
seasoning. It looks like he'll run anywhere now. 
</P>
<P>
	``The owners definitely have derby fever and I'd like to go,  
too, if the horse shows me he's good enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meche, who has never had a Kentucky Derby mount, said Epic Honor  
was making a strong case for a Triple Crown campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a real tough trip and he overcame a lot of trouble,  
that's for sure. A lot of horses wouldn't have been able to do what 
he did today. He's been doing everything a horse could possibly to 
make it to the derby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Epic Honor covered the mile in 1:36.76, earned $55,000 for his  
owners, and returned $6.80 to win, $5.60 to place and $9.40 to 
show. Brave Gun hung on for second and paid $7 to place and $13.80 
to show while longshot Sixoutasix returned $20.20. 
</P>
<P>
	The unusual show pool payout was due to the triple-entry of High  
Noon Meeting, Voice of Destiny and Absolute Harmony finishing out 
of the money. The three, bet as a single entry, had gone off as the 
odds-on favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	Epic Honor, who has three wins in eight career starts and has  
never run worse than third, boosted his lifetime earnings to 
$194,850. The colt, pointing toward a Triple Crown campaign, has 
won stakes in each of his last two starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonde said Epic Honor would run next in either the $200,000 El  
Camino Real Derby on March 6 at Bay Meadows or the $750,000 Gallery 
Furniture.com Stakes at Turfway Park in Kentucky on March 27. The 
Kentucky Derby will be run May 1 at Churchill Downs.

<HEADLINE> Did Scandal Weaken Presidency? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When the next occupant settles into the Oval  
Office in January 2001, he or she may feel the power of the 
presidency subtly reduced by the distant events of The Year of 
Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Starr's tireless investigation of President Clinton, the  
president's pursuit of losing legal gambits, the House's vote to 
impeach -- all nibbled away at presidential power, constitutional 
scholars say. 
</P>
<P>
	The erosion began even earlier, with the Supreme Court's  
unanimous decision on May 27, 1997 that Paula Jones could bring her 
sexual harassment lawsuit against a sitting president. That led to 
the deposition in which Clinton denied ever engaging in sexual 
relations with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Some scholars view this weakening of the office as part of a  
natural pendulum swing away from powerful presidents who have 
dominated the 20th century. Others lament the whittling away of 
power. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's probably too early to know what, if any, lasting effects  
this tawdry episode will have on the presidency,'' historian Alan 
Brinkley of Columbia University said. ``But it would be naive to 
think that the rancor of viciousness of this episode would leave no 
legacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, the Clinton White House went to court in the heat  
of the expanding scandal to press a series of constitutional 
questions that future presidents may wish had been left alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to block grand jury subpoenas to some of his closest  
advisers and bodyguards, Clinton claimed lawyer-client privilege, 
executive privilege and a special privilege covering Secret Service 
officers. He lost them all. The courts ruled the Secret Service 
privileges didn't exist, that the attorney-client privilege 
dissolved in the face of a grand jury subpoena seeking evidence of 
possible criminal offenses and that executive privilege could be 
overcome by the needs of prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Clinton administration was almost reckless in its  
willingness to litigate each of these issues despite the remote 
possibility of success,'' said law professor Jonathan Turley, who 
represented four former attorneys general opposing the Secret 
Service privilege. 
</P>
<P>
	Future presidents can no longer presume that they -- or the first  
lady -- will be able to keep secret their conversations with top 
aides or government lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Past presidents benefited from the ambiguity in the law, trying  
to strike a bargain when Congress demanded testimony or documents, 
and storing away court challenges to be pulled out in moments of 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``President Clinton virtually cleaned the pantry out and left  
little for the next occupant of the office,'' Turley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, the president fought Mrs. Jones' right to sue all the  
way to the Supreme Court instead of negotiating a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that we've got this precedent on the books has to be  
disturbing to whoever is in the White House,'' said Buckner F. 
Melton Jr., author of ``The First Impeachment,'' about the case of 
Sen. William Blount, who was impeached late in the 18th century. 
``It raises the possibility of suits to harass a president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the most hotly debated issue was whether the  
Republican-controlled House lowered the impeachment standard, 
leaving future presidents vulnerable to partisan attack, by 
approving articles that didn't focus on misuse of the powers of the 
presidential office. 
</P>
<P>
	A bevy of historians came forward to argue that attempts to  
cover up a sexual affair -- even if it involved perjury and 
obstruction of justice -- didn't rise to the level of an impeachable 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Others disagreed. And the House impeachment managers maintained  
that failure to oust the president despite strong evidence he broke 
the law set a poor constitutional precedent. 
</P>
<P>
	Precedent, however, may be overrated when it comes to  
impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's such a political process, it's very easy to ignore what  
happened in earlier impeachments,'' said historian Melton. 
</P>
<P>
	In one way Clinton's travails may benefit future officeholders:  
The Lewinsky case has increased momentum for doing away with, or at 
least reining in, independent counsels such as Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	The independent counsel law is up for renewal in June.  
Democrats, who traditionally favored the Watergate-era reform, are 
now joining Republicans who have long said the law allows 
prosecutors too much unfettered power to pursue the president, his 
Cabinet and top aides. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the events of the past year will permanently cripple the  
presidency. A president is still America's leader and 
agenda-setter. 
</P>
<P>
	``While in the short term there will be damage done, in the long  
run the presidency has a real resiliency,'' said Michael Genovese, 
director of the Institute of Leadership Studies at Loyola Marymount 
University.

<HEADLINE> Lakers' Signing of Rodman Imminent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- The Los Angeles Lakers expect to have  
Dennis Rodman signed to a contract before Tuesday night's game 
against the Charlotte Hornets, according to a source close to the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	The source, who spoke late Sunday on the condition of anonymity,  
said he expected Rodman to sign a contract ``late tonight, tomorrow 
or Tuesday at the latest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If that's the case, Rodman could be in uniform against the  
Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, the NBA's leading rebounder for the past seven seasons,  
didn't attend the Lakers' 101-99 loss to Indiana on Sunday, 
although he reportedly had tickets to the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers, who have started the season a disappointing 3-3,  
first expressed an interest in Rodman two weeks ago when he met 
with owner Jerry Buss for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers can only offer Rodman the veterans' minimum of $1  
million -- prorated to $600,000 for this lockout-shortened season -- 
but he'll also earn $3 million from his endorsement contract with 
Converse. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers' frontline suffered a blow Sunday when forward Robert  
Horry was hospitalized with chest pains shortly before the start of 
the game against the Indiana Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	Horry was diagnosed as having an irregular heartbeat. It was not  
immediately known how long he would be sidelined. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, who turns 38 in May, has played on five of the last 10  
NBA champions, including the last three with the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	His career scoring average is just 7.5 points, but he is one of  
the greatest rebounders in league history with a 13.2 average. No 
other player ever won seven straight rebounding titles. 
</P>
<P>
	After Michael Jordan's retirement last month, the Bulls opted  
not to pursue Rodman. He flirted with the idea of signing with 
Orlando or Miami, but both teams backed off. 
</P>
<P>
	Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal has said repeatedly he supports  
the acquisition of Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	With Rodman's history, it's impossible to assume anything is  
certain. As far as his erratic behavior is concerned, Lakers coach 
Del Harris said if Rodman becomes a member of the team, he won't 
prejudge him. 
</P>
<P>
	``You really don't know a player until you've coached him in  
this league,'' Harris said Saturday. ``I think you're better off 
not listening to the rumors and everything and just finding out 
ways to work with the people that you do have. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are always ways to work with people. You just have to  
find the different communicating methods that are required, or in 
some cases non-communicating methods that are required and go from 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked before Sunday's game if Rodman would be the missing  
link for the Lakers, Harris said: ``We certainly have done well so 
far without Dennis. You never want to say you can't get someplace 
if you don't have somebody you don't have.''

<HEADLINE> Lakers' Horry Leaves Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Los Angeles Lakers forward Robert Horry  
was discharged Monday after being hospitalized nearly 24 hours for 
an irregular heartbeat, and might play Tuesday night against the 
Charlotte Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
	Horry, 28, was taken to Centinela Hospital Medical Center due to  
chest pains shortly before the start of Sunday's game against the 
Indiana Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They monitored his heart all night, did a series of tests  
yesterday and this morning,'' team spokesman John Black said at 
Monday's practice at Los Angeles Southwest College. ``All tests 
came back within the range of normal. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did have an irregular heartbeat. He no longer has the  
irregular heartbeat. I don't think they will be able to determine 
what caused it. There are 100 different things that could have 
caused it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Black said to the best of his knowledge, Horry had no history of  
heart problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a cold and upper respiratory infection, he had some  
discomfort,'' Black said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. John Moe, one of the Lakers' team physicians, supervised the  
testing on Horry. 
</P>
<P>
	Black said Horry was to wear a monitor for 24 hours through  
Tuesday's shootaround. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it remains normal today, tonight, tomorrow through the  
shootaround, he'll play,'' Black said. 
</P>
<P>
	Horry is averaging 5.5 points and 5.8 rebounds. He was replaced  
in the starting lineup by Travis Knight, who had four points, nine 
rebounds and four blocked shots in a 101-99 loss to the Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	Lakers guard Derek Fisher said Horry told him shortly before  
being hospitalized that he had been having pains in recent weeks 
and it scared him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad to hear that he'll be OK,'' Fisher said. ``I'm not  
interested in him hurrying back to be with us. His health is more 
important. We just wanted to know that he was OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lakers coach Del Harris also expressed relief.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's bad enough you have a knee or back or something like that  
-- internal, that's a little scary,'' Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Fox also missed practice Monday due to an upper respiratory  
infection, and Shaquille O'Neal, the NBA's leading scorer, attended 
but was kept on the sidelines because of his strained right groin. 
</P>
<P>
	``Best practice I ever had today,'' O'Neal said with a smile,  
having spent time on a stair-type exercise machine and doing a 
little shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal missed last Thursday's 86-75 loss at Minnesota due to the  
ailment, but returned to action impressively against Indiana with 
36 points and 17 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's never going to go away, I'm going to have this problem  
the rest of my career,'' said O'Neal, who missed 21 games with a 
similar injury last season. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal said he planned on playing against the Hornets.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can use him,'' Harris said with a smile.  
</P>
<P>
	Harris also said he believes Fox will be able to play, and he  
was hopeful as far as Horry was concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been coming and going, as they say in the Midwest,''  
Harris said of his players. ``We had a good practice today, we made 
some progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers bring a 3-3 record into Tuesday night's game against  
the Hornets (1-4). 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm embarrassed and very (angry),'' O'Neal said. ``I've never  
come out 3-3. I think guys need to step their game up. Everybody 
has to be on the same page. If everybody is not on the same page, 
we're not going to go anywhere. Sometimes, we are (on the same 
page).''

<HEADLINE> Lady Vols Stay No. 1 in AP Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Opponents might be getting the idea that the way to play  
Tennessee is to slow it down. 
</P>
<P>
	Let them try, coach Pat Summitt said.  
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee's last two opponents have tried to control the tempo,  
but the Lady Vols beat them both and Monday, they remained an 
overwhelming choice as the No. 1 team in The Associated Press 
women's basketball poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn gave Tennessee a tough game Sunday before the Lady Vols  
prevailed 71-63. Vanderbilt also played at a controlled pace the 
week before. and Tennessee won 66-60. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's something I'm sure people will look at and say  
maybe we do want to change our approach,'' Summitt said. 
``Fortunately, we've been in that situation enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday, our players did not seem to get rattled at all with  
it,'' she said. ``They just kept their consistency and their 
composure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With its swift, multi-talented athletes, Tennessee prefers to  
get into a running game. And when teams try to run with the Lady 
Vols, they usually get run over. Before beating Vanderbilt, 
Tennessee had routed Mississippi 96-58 and Mississippi State 94-53. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee often can pick up the tempo with its defense, forcing  
turnovers that lead to quick baskets. But if the Lady Vols are 
forced into a half-court game, Summitt feels her three-time 
defending national champions can handle it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're certainly better prepared than we were a year ago,'' she  
said. ``We've been in that situation more this year. Quite 
honestly, last year I thought more people would attempt to play us 
the way Vanderbilt, Alabama and Auburn played us. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect to see it more as we close out the season and get  
into the postseason,'' Summitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee (23-1) received 40 of 41 first-place votes and 1,024  
points from a national media panel to lead the poll for the sixth 
straight week. No. 2 Purdue and No. 3 Louisiana Tech both held 
their positions, but there was considerable shuffling after that. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven teams from the Top 25 lost during the past week,  
including four in the Top 10, but seven were beaten by other ranked 
teams and no one dropped from the poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue (23-1) received the other first-place vote and had 981  
points. The Boilermakers had to come from behind to win at Penn 
State in overtime, then routed Ohio State at home. Louisiana Tech 
(20-2) beat a Top 25 team, Florida International, on the road and 
received 947 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado State (26-1) moved up one spot to fourth and was  
followed by Old Dominion, Connecticut, Rutgers, Duke, Notre Dame 
and Virginia Tech, which made the Top 10 for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Old Dominion jumped three places to its highest ranking of the  
season after beating Connecticut, which dropped two spots. Rutgers 
climbed two places following a victory over Notre Dame, which went 
from sixth to ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 7 ranking was the highest for Rutgers since it was sixth  
the week of Jan. 14, 1991. Duke fell one spot to eighth after its 
first Atlantic Coast Conference loss, 80-75 at Clemson. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Tech climbed two places to 11th, North Carolina was 12th,  
UCLA 13th and Clemson and Georgia were tied for 14th. Georgia fell 
four places after losing to unranked Vanderbilt. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State was 16th, followed by Virginia, Oregon, Iowa State  
and UC Santa Barbara. Kansas, Auburn, Florida International, LSU 
and Alabama held the five final spots. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn also lost to Alabama last week and fell five places for  
the biggest drop in the poll. Clemson's move from 19th to 14th and 
Oregon's from 23rd to 18th were the biggest jumps. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemson beat Georgia Tech by 28 before knocking off Duke, while  
Oregon defeated Washington State and Washington to pull into a 
first-place tie with UCLA in the Pac-10.

<HEADLINE> Ca. Newborns Accidentally Switched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORANGE, Calif. (AP) -- Two newborn boys were switched at the  
hospital and one went home with the wrong mother for an hour before 
the officials discovered the error. 
</P>
<P>
	Four nurses at St. Joseph Hospital were placed on administrative  
leave after the mistake was discovered Sunday, officials said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We deeply regret this error and are putting additional  
safeguards into place to ensure that this does not happen again,'' 
hospital spokesman Larry Ainsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
	Babies and mothers at the Orange County hospital wear  
identification wristbands. A nurse and the mother must indicate the 
names on the bands match up before the patient can be discharged, 
Ainsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
	But a nurse and one mother apparently failed to notice a  
mismatch when she received the infant and was sent home Sunday 
afternoon. An hour later, the hospital realized the mistake after 
the other mother noticed her wristband did not match the one of the 
baby she was holding. 
</P>
<P>
	Iliana Bravo then was called and told the child she had taken  
home and breast fed was not hers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started shaking. ... I was panicking,'' Iliana Bravo said  
Monday. ``It's a good thing that we found out earlier. What would 
happen if we (found) out 20 years ... from now?'' 
</P>
<P>
	She returned to the hospital, and DNA testing confirmed that  
this time she had the right child. 
</P>
<P>
	Ainsworth said hospital policy will require that two nurses,  
rather than one, will check the wristbands before new mothers are 
discharged.

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Was 1st 'Net Biggie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It was the first Net blockbuster: The Intern and  
the President. For the first time, the new medium became a truly 
mainstream form of journalism. 
</P>
<P>
	And following the Senate's acquittal of President Clinton on  
impeachment articles, the same question that confronts mainstream 
media now confronts the Web: Where do we go from here? 
</P>
<P>
	``The offline and online components converged last year,'' said  
David Weir, managing editor of the online news magazine Salon. 
``This story continues to cycle back and forth, both online and 
offline, and that kind of relationship is really, really 
revolutionizing our business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The public scandal started online on Jan. 17, 1998, when Matt  
Drudge told the Net community that Newsweek magazine was sitting on 
a bomb about to explode in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	He appeared on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' made the first mention  
of the infamous Gap dress and even got his own television program. 
</P>
<P>
	He had his stumbles, including a discredited report that Clinton  
may have fathered a child with a prostitute while governor of 
Arkansas. But the giants stumbled, too. The Wall Street Journal and 
the Dallas Morning News yanked early stories from their Web sites 
when they proved inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
	The major broadcast and print outlets also reported that Clinton  
stormed out of the room in fury during his taped deposition. That 
was wrong, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of the mainstream media made the same mistakes -- or  
worse -- than stuff you could find online,'' said John Pavlik, the 
executive director of the Center for New Media at Columbia 
University's Graduate School of Journalism. ``The online sources in 
some cases did a better job than the traditional media.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And whatever the source, people wanted to talk about it. The Web  
became a digital water cooler. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the Internet almost came to a halt when millions of  
people tried to download Special Independent Counsel Kenneth 
Starr's report on the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were so many times when the news seemed incredible, the  
public wanted to absorb that,'' said Colby Devitt, supervisor for 
discussion forums at The New York Times' Web site. The forums and 
the Web ``contributed to the feeling that they were part of the 
nation and a public community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, the Times sponsored more than 20 forums on Clinton and  
Lewinsky, and received more than 350,000 posts. And that's just on 
one site on the Web, which had Clinton scandal sites springing up 
like popcorn in a microwave. 
</P>
<P>
	A quick search on Altavista, a popular search engine, turned up  
almost 208,000 sites that mention Clinton and Lewinsky, and more 
than 136,000 mention Clinton and impeachment. But now, with the 
story over, what comes next? 
</P>
<P>
	A site run by Robert Sherman, www.impeachment.net in Los  
Angeles, already has plans. ``If it really does dry up, we'll just 
fold our tent,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others will press on.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet is a godsend,'' said Eugene Delgaudio, president  
of the Council of Volunteer Americans. ``It was literally sent by 
God to give the mimeograph crowd a way to communicate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His organization sponsors the Committee to Impeach the  
President, and runs the Web site, www.impeachclinton.org, where the 
topics are often the deaths of Vince Foster and Ron Brown, alleged 
illegal fundraising and the transfer of technology to China. He has 
come up with a new name for his group: The Committee to Impeach the 
President Again.

<HEADLINE> Meese Panel Decries Crime Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The avalanche of new laws Congress has passed  
since 1970 to make America's streets safe has failed, a report 
concludes. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no persuasive evidence that federalization of local  
crime makes the streets safer for American citizens,'' says a 
report prepared by a blue-ribbon task force sponsored by the 
American Bar Association and chaired by former Attorney General 
Edwin Meese III. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was to be made public today.  
</P>
<P>
	The 16-member task force says a Congress worried about being  
called ``soft on crime'' actually may be hurting the fight against 
street violence by passing federal laws that duplicate state and 
local efforts nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The 56-page report, backed up by hundreds of pages of  
statistical findings, calls on Congress to resist its political 
impulses. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is an understandable pressure on Congress not to vote  
against crime legislation even if it is misguided, unnecessary and 
harmful,'' the report's executive summary says. ``But there must be 
a recognition that a refusal to endorse a new federal crime is not 
a sign that a legislator is soft on crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The product of a two-year study, the report notes with alarm  
that more than 40 percent of all federal criminal laws enacted 
since the Civil War were passed since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	``Highly publicized criminal incidents are frequently  
accompanied by proposals for congressional responses for no reason 
other than that the conduct is serious, even if the activity is 
already handled by state law,'' the summary says. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Federalization of Criminal Law'' report mirrors criticism  
raised by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist in his year-end report 
on the federal judiciary in December. He blamed the trend on 
pressure in Congress ``to appear responsive to every highly 
publicized societal ill or sensational crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report states: ``Increased federalization is rarely, if  
ever, likely to have any appreciable effect on the categories of 
violent crime that most concern Americans, because in practice 
federal law enforcement can reach only a small percent of such 
activity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State law enforcement accounts for about 95 percent of all  
prosecutions nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inappropriate federalization'' can contribute to ``long-range  
damage to real crime control'' by diverting federal money better 
spent on state law-enforcement systems, the report says, and can 
deplete funding of federal law-enforcement efforts not duplicated 
by the states. 
</P>
<P>
	``The expanding coverage of federal criminal law, much of it  
enacted in the absence of a demonstrated and distinctive federal 
justification, is moving the nation rapidly toward two broadly 
overlapping, parallel and essentially redundant sets of criminal 
prohibitions. ... Such a system has little to commend it and much 
to condemn it,'' the report says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sampling of the latest available statistics demonstrates that  
several recently enacted federal statutes, championed by many 
because they would have a claimed impact on crime, have hardly been 
used at all,'' the task force found. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the laws cited dealt with drive-by shootings, interstate  
domestic violence, failure to report child abuse and murder by 
escaped prisoners.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Trade Surplus at Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's trade surplus surged nearly 40 percent last  
year to a record high, further diminishing hopes that Asia's 
largest economy will act as a buyer of last resort for goods 
produced in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's current account surplus, the broadest measure of trade,  
surged 38.7 percent to an unprecedented 15.86 trillion yen ($139.18 
billion) in 1998, the Finance Ministry announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The sharp increase comes amid growing pressure on Japan to  
revive its sluggish economy and import more goods as a way to help 
its struggling neighbors in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures -- which measure trade in merchandise, services,  
tourism and investment -- are calculated by taking the difference 
between Japan's income from foreign sources against payments on 
foreign obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports tumbled 11.7 percent to $288.43 billion while exports  
fell only 1.3 percent to $428.81 billion for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous record was a surplus of $128.72 billion for 1993.  
</P>
<P>
	Japan's current account surplus also rose for the month of  
December, gaining 13.3 percent from the same month a year earlier 
to $12.79 billion. Both imports and exports fell in December but 
the surplus grew because imports fell faster. 
</P>
<P>
	Exports from Japan fell 12.9 percent to $34.90 billion, while  
imports dropped 23.3 percent to $21.20 billion.

Motors Inc. will return to work later this week, ending a 70-day 
long strike over job security, company and union officials said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision came after about 88 percent of 3,800 assembly line  
workers voted in favor of accepting an agreement between management 
and the labor union on job security and other issues late Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	They will return to work Friday after the lunar New Year's  
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement calls for a job guarantee for the next several  
years for those who stay with the carmaker after a merger with 
Daewoo Motors Co., but details are yet to be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
	They also agreed to an extra 16 months' salary for those who  
take early retirement and an extra eight months' salary for those 
who stay as a compensation for property loss and psychological 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers said many of them had bought Samsung passenger cars to  
save the money-losing company, and prices for their apartments near 
Samsung assembly lines in the southern city of Pusan dropped 
sharply since the merger agreement was announced on Dec. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the government-mediated deal, Samsung Motors, South  
Korea's newest and smallest carmaker, agreed to be taken over by 
Daewoo Motors Co., the nation's No. 2 car manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, Samsung Electronics Corp., the nation's largest home  
appliance maker, will take over Daewoo Electronics Co. 
</P>
<P>
	When the announcement was made, Samsung Motors workers walked  
off their jobs immediately, demanding job security. They feared the 
merger would result in mass layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	A restructuring of South Korea's ailing conglomerates, or  
chaebol, was a key condition of a $58 billion bailout of the 
country's economy by the International Monetary Fund last year.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Riot Death Toll Is Now 20 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- The death toll from religious riots in  
eastern Indonesia over the weekend rose to 20 today as troops 
patrolled two islands, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting between Christians and Muslim gangs from rival villages  
broke out Sunday on Haruku and Saparua Islands, about 1,400 miles 
northeast of Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
	A police officer, who identified himself as Sgt. Ferdi, said in  
a telephone interview from the nearby city of Ambon that 14 were 
killed on Sunday and another six people died from their wounds 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said many of the dead were killed when security forces  
opened fire on rampaging mobs who had set fire to dozens of homes. 
Some were stabbed to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents said both islands were quiet but tense today.  
</P>
<P>
	``Troops are everywhere. But we are still afraid more fighting  
might start,'' said one resident who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, in the capital Jakarta, armed forces commander Gen.  
Wiranto announced he had ordered his troops to shoot troublemakers 
on sight so as to quell rising civil unrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, at least 105 people were killed and almost 3,000  
homes and buildings were burned when Muslims and Christians clashed 
during a three-week period on three islands in Maluku province. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia is the world's most populous Islamic nation. Maluku,  
which was known in Dutch colonial times as the Spice Islands, has a 
large Christian population. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia, facing its worst economic crisis in decades, has been  
plagued by political and social unrest.

<HEADLINE> New Vaccine May Fights Malaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A team of researchers has discovered a  
possible new way to vaccinate against malaria, one of the world's 
biggest killers. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaria kills up to 3 million people a year and sickens another  
300 million. Creating a vaccine is crucial because the parasite has 
begun developing resistance to drugs used to treat malaria, and 
even mosquitos that spread the disease are withstanding pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
	But finding a malaria vaccine has proved exceptionally  
difficult, and testing in 1997 concluded the candidate long thought 
the best hope was actually worthless. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason most vaccine attempts have failed is that they  
focused on just one part of the malaria parasite's complex life 
cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	Now researchers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and  
Prevention and from India have created a multipronged vaccine 
designed to make the immune system fight the parasite at many 
stages: When the mosquito bite sends it into the body, when it 
invades the liver and when infection moves into the bloodstream. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientists immunized rabbits. The animals' immune system  
produced antibodies that prevented malaria parasites from invading 
liver cells and from replicating in the blood, the scientists 
reported Monday in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	Just because the vaccine stimulates a rabbit's immune system  
doesn't mean it would work in people, cautioned parasitologist 
Anthony Holder of London's National Institute for Medical Research. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC hopes further testing in primates will prove promising  
enough to try the vaccine in people.

<HEADLINE> Even Gordon Impressed by `The Pass' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Considering that Jeff Gordon had  
described ``The Pass'' a hundred times by Monday morning, it was 
surprising that he hadn't viewed it yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't wait to see the tape of the closing laps,'' said the  
winner of Sunday's dramatic Daytona 500. ``I knew it was intense 
and exciting from where I was sitting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon may flinch when he does see the moment race fans will be  
talking about for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Pass'' took place as the leaders drove toward the first  
turn on the 2 1/2-mile oval 11 laps from the finish at Daytona 
International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon chose that moment to try to pass Rusty Wallace for the  
lead. The two-time defending Winston Cup champion darted to the 
lower portion of the banked track and picked up speed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had been trying to set Rusty up for a few laps and I had a  
lot of momentum built up when I started under him,'' Gordon said. 
``Then I got out there and saw Ricky and thought for a couple of 
seconds I was going to have to get on the brakes hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately for Ricky Rudd, he had gotten involved in a  
multicar crash earlier in the race and was driving slowly around 
the apron of the track with his battered car, simply trying to pick 
up points for the long season ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	The lane between Wallace, traveling at close to 190 mph, and  
Rudd, going considerably slower, was narrow and getting smaller as 
Wallace squeezed down to discourage Gordon's bravery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `Oh, Ricky, I hope you see me coming because I'm  
coming real fast,' '' Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The television replay from high atop the grandstand shows that  
at the last moment Rudd moved over just enough, his left side tires 
in the grass, kicking up spouts of dirt. Wallace also gave ground 
grudgingly, sliding inches up the banking. 
</P>
<P>
	The tape reveals about a foot of open space on each side of  
Gordon's speeding Chevrolet as it burst through the tiny opening. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was watching the race on TV in our motorhome in the infield  
and I screamed,'' said Brooke Gordon, Jeff's wife. Her face still 
registered a bit of fear as she thought about that moment nearly 18 
hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just happened to open up,'' Gordon said. ``It was a split  
second.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace is 0-18 in the Daytona 500 and wanted the victory at  
least as much as Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought he was going to drive right in the back of Rudd,''  
Wallace said. ``I had him pinned down there and I said, `Man, I'm 
not going to wreck a bunch of cars.' So I pulled up and he got 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The daring move did not give Gordon the victory. He still had to  
hold off Wallace and Mike Skinner in a three-wide battle down the 
backstretch and through turns three and four to complete the 
maneuver and grab the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he wound up going head-to-head with Dale Earnhardt, barely  
holding off one of the most aggressive stock car drivers ever for 
the final 10 laps as The Intimidator darted up and down the banking 
looking for an opening that never came. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows I did everything I could to win the race,'' Gordon  
said. ``There were times when there were some gutsy moves, and Dale 
makes gutsy moves out there, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It may have been a defining moment for Gordon, who at 27 has  
already become the biggest star in the fastest growing sport in 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	Forget the record $2.1 million payday. Forget the fact that  
Gordon won his third straight race, including the final two of 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Pass'' proved to a lot of people that Jeff Gordon isn't  
winning just because car-owner Rick Hendrick gives him great 
equipment and crew chief Ray Evernham is the best in the business. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon has developed a reputation for finesse on the racetrack.  
But there was little finesse in the move he made to get past 
Earnhardt late in the race, and even less when he popped past 
Wallace and Rudd. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's such a big event,'' Gordon said. ``Late in the race like  
that when you're making a charge, you take every opportunity you 
can. That's what I did. Brooke and I talked about it a lot last 
night. I would have done it time and time again if I had to just 
because it's the Daytona 500.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Arrives for Mexican Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MERIDA, Mexico (AP) -- From a cozy Valentine dinner between two  
couples to a summit of two leaders, President Clinton is making a 
neighborly call on Mexico to encourage its uphill battle with drug 
traffickers and promote purchases of U.S. exports. 
</P>
<P>
	His meetings today with President Ernesto Zedillo at the  
secluded Hacienda Temozon -- translated, aptly for this 23-hour 
visit, as ``Whirlwind Estate'' -- come only two weeks before Clinton 
must render a formal evaluation of Mexico's cooperation in fighting 
illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials traveling with Clinton tried to keep drugs from  
dominating headlines from the visit, which they described as 
``regular maintenance'' of relations with an important ally. 
</P>
<P>
	Export-Import Bank president James Harmon, part of a 52-member  
U.S. delegation, was here for Clinton's announcement today of a new 
two-year, $4 billion line of credit to Mexican businesses that 
``buy American,'' in an effort to increase the already bustling 
Mexican market for U.S. exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who joined Clinton from  
her weekend visit to the Paris peace talks on Kosovo, has not made 
her recommendations on the drug certifications, required under a 
1986 law. 
</P>
<P>
	But White House officials made plain in advance of Clinton's  
arrival in this city on the Yucatan Peninsula that he is likely to 
certify Mexico as an ally in fighting narcotics, as it has been for 
12 years. This would come despite Mexico's disappointing record on 
extraditions and a drop last year in cocaine and heroin seizures. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no doubt Mexico is doing everything it can to fight  
this massive problem,'' said National Security Council spokesman 
David Leavy. 
</P>
<P>
	A failing grade would mean tough economic sanctions on top of  
diplomatic insult to Mexico, which sees the U.S. certification 
process as political. 
</P>
<P>
	To that end, Clinton was here partly to gird Zedillo for a hard  
sell on Capitol Hill, where Congress can override his certification 
of Mexico. ``If history is any guide, we certainly anticipate a 
very difficult time'' in Congress, said deputy White House chief of 
staff Maria Echaveste. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico blames much of its drug problem on the United States,  
because Americans are the world's biggest buyers of illicit 
narcotics. About two-thirds of the cocaine sold in the United 
States comes through Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Today marks Clinton's second trip to Mexico as president and his  
seventh meeting with Zedillo. 
</P>
<P>
	They were expected to sign modest agreements to improve border  
safety, prevent cross-border pollution and tuberculosis infections, 
and train Mexico's soon-to-be-created federal police force, which 
is modeled after the FBI and meant to be a fresh start for the 
country's long-corrupt law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	They also planned to highlight booming economic trade in the  
five years since the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Eclipsing even Japan, Mexico has emerged as the second-largest  
foreign market for U.S. exports, after Canada. U.S. exports to 
Mexico total $79 billion a year, more than twice the pre-NAFTA 
figure. 
</P>
<P>
	For Clinton, the mission marked a passage into his  
post-impeachment presidency and brought an obvious sense of 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	He and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton lingered for three  
hours Sunday night over an intimate dinner with Zedillo and his 
wife, Nilda. 
</P>
<P>
	And, after months of avoiding reporters, the Clintons visited  
the press cabin of Air Force One on Sunday night, passing out 
chocolates from a huge heart-shaped box. 
</P>
<P>
	``Happy Valentine's Day,'' the president said. ``Isn't this the  
biggest heart you ever saw in your life? This is a better kind of 
heart of darkness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did not elaborate.

<HEADLINE> 3 Designers Take Center Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Three things count in the business of fashion:  
timing, timing, timing. 
</P>
<P>
	That is why American designers are staging their fall Fashion  
Week previews six weeks earlier than usual. 
</P>
<P>
	Fall in February? What's the hurry?  
</P>
<P>
	Ask nearly any designer here: It's good to be the early bird.  
The unprecedented jump-start was prompted by an itch to leapfrog in 
front of the London, Paris and Milan shows. Those fashion capitals 
normally play a gig of openings for an international audience of 
retailers, editors and photographers before sending the weary 
traveling circus packing for the openings here. 
</P>
<P>
	Designers stateside say they want to be judged without being  
compared to the rest of the pack. Besides, they say, having second 
billing typically means receiving more accusations of copying the 
front-runners, having less time for production and delivery, and 
fewer dollars for the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a slight puffing of the chest, now that Americans can  
compete on a world level and didn't have to be last in the ring of 
shows,'' says Stan Herman, president of 7th on Sixth, which 
coordinates Fashion Week. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the nearly 80 semiannual previews are centralized at  
tents at Bryant Park, a bit of midtown greenery behind the New York 
Public Library. On Monday, fashion fans gathered there to glimpse 
the glamour gowns of Caracas-born Carolina Herrera, celebrated for 
having dressed Hillary Clinton, Jacqueline Kennedy and Whitney 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are so many occasions, especially in New York, no?''  
says Herrera. That's why she stands ready to lavish her customers 
with pullover sweaters made entirely of mink, dresses fairly 
dripping in ostrich and mohair skirts spangled with sequins. 
</P>
<P>
	But not everything on the runways is for ladies of renown. Or  
for ladies at all. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, both women's and men's shows have been  
consolidated into the Fashion Week schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	At some shows, the runway is coed. Sunday's curtain-raiser, for  
example, was Donna Karan's DKNY line of men's and women's clothes 
built for comfort. DKNY, which runs about 50 percent below the 
price of Donna Karan collection, puts a sporty spin on sportswear. 
</P>
<P>
	For women, there are baggy ``cotton slip cover duvet'' coats,  
which indeed resemble down-filled comforters. For men, the line 
offers hoods, wool cargo pants and drawstrings on nylon pullovers 
to underscore the athletic influence. 
</P>
<P>
	Cynthia Rowley, who showed Sunday at Grand Central Terminal, was  
headed for more exotic destinations. ``I have cashmere sweaters 
from Mongolia, sequins from Paris and beading from India,'' she 
said of her embellished women's wear. Even men's snowboard pants 
were teamed with sparkly mohair sweaters. 
</P>
<P>
	But some outfits were sparse, most notably the one worn by  
``Cabaret'' star Alan Cumming, who ended the show bare-chested, in 
a red taffeta ball skirt. He still didn't look quite as fetching as 
front row members Salma Hayek, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Natasha 
Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	This season's New York schedule was prompted by German designer  
Helmut Lang. His decision to relocate here and show early during 
last fall's round of Fashion Week created a domino effect, 
inspiring a dozen American designers to likewise jump the gun. 
</P>
<P>
	But not every New York designer is here. Bill Blass and Geoffrey  
Beene are showing in April. Both cite late fabric deliveries. 
Blass' delay also stems from his December hospitalization following 
a mild stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	But in one crucial context, being last has its distinctions:  
This week's previews represent fall 1999/winter 2000 -- the final 
collections of the millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	The collections wrap up Friday with Calvin Klein.  
</P>
<P>
	What's next on the fashion roster?  
</P>
<P>
	``With so much change, it is hard to know who is going to  
leapfrog next over whom,'' says Herman. 
</P>
<P>
	He's hardly the only one speculating.  
</P>
<P>
	``In the future,'' says New York designer Randolph Duke, ``we  
may be looking at fashion two years ahead. I could see it 
happening. Like, I could be working now on my collection for 2004 
and saying, `I'm seeing pink.'''

<HEADLINE> Dave Matthews Honored in Virginia </HEADLINE>

<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Even the staid halls of Virginia's Capitol  
are not immune from Dave Matthews mania. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, dozens of girls and boys who work as pages in the  
Senate and House of Delegates rushed through the halls to catch a 
glimpse of the rocker, who was being honored along with the rest of 
the Dave Matthews Band. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh my God,'' said an awed Mary Reid Ervin, 14. ``I'm so  
excited. I'm just afraid I won't be able to take a picture with him 
because I'm supposed to stand here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seconds later, Mary got permission to leave her post to get the  
picture. ``It was so cool,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>

support we've received from all the people in Virginia has made it 
possible to achieve what we have,'' Matthews said.

<HEADLINE> Tripp Reviving Book Idea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Linda Tripp is reviving the idea of writing a  
book and says she thinks President Clinton ``will think twice'' 
before engaging in any improper behavior in the aftermath of the 
Monica Lewinsky scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing Monday night on CNN's ``Larry King Live'' program,  
Mrs. Tripp said that ``from what I'm seeing, the truth is just 
never going to get out there, so to the extent that I may decide to 
let the truth come out,'' she is ``seriously considering'' doing a 
book. She says Ms. Lewinsky is ``protecting'' the president by not 
revealing all that she knows about their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	In raising the book possibility, Mrs. Tripp is providing her  
critics with yet another issue to use against her. Mrs. Tripp's 
supporters have spent much of the past year saying she did not have 
a profit motive in mind in tape-recording Ms. Lewinsky's 
confidences about her relationship with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp had gone to New York literary agent Lucianne Goldberg  
in 1996 with a book proposal about the Clinton White House, but 
says she didn't go through with it because she was afraid she would 
lose her government job. She still works for the Defense 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The book project came before Ms. Lewinsky told Mrs. Tripp about  
her involvement with the president. It was Mrs. Goldberg who first 
suggested the taping when Mrs. Tripp was about to become a witness 
in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the ultimate impact of betraying a friend by  
recording their phone calls, Mrs. Tripp said, ``I can't say that I 
stopped anything that he may or may not be doing right now, but I 
think he'll think twice about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp said Ms. Lewinsky became suicidal partly out of fear  
that Clinton would learn that the former White House intern had 
confided to others. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp said Ms. Lewinsky was ``not suicidal'' due just to  
Clinton ``dumping her'' but because of her ``biggest fear that he 
would find out she shared her story. ... That was part of the 
suicide threat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp also criticized Ms. Lewinsky's mother, Marcia Lewis,  
for taking the view that her daughter's relationship with the 
president ``was OK; more than OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Depicting herself as an older authority figure for Ms. Lewinsky,  
Mrs. Tripp said she made clear to Ms. Lewinsky that ``I did not 
think this was cool'' to be having a relationship with Clinton. 
Mrs. Tripp said she refrained from criticizing Mrs. Lewis to Ms. 
Lewinsky because of the close mother-daughter ties. 
</P>
<P>
	As for her own well-being, Mrs. Tripp said she genuinely fears  
for her safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the president or one of his henchmen is going to  
be behind a bush with an Uzi,'' said Mrs. Tripp. ``Do I think it's 
possible that I may down the road walk in front of a Mack truck and 
have an unfortunate accident? I think it's possible.''

<HEADLINE>  Announcer Jimmy Dudley Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- When Jimmy Dudley was working as an apprentice  
announcer on Chicago Cubs games, his lively, melodious voice caught 
the ear of a major sponsor of Cleveland Indians radio broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the man I want to do the Indians games,'' the chief of  
Erin Brew beer decided in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
	For the next 20 years, Dudley was the voice of the Cleveland  
Indians and greeted fans tuning in on the radio with ``Hello 
baseball fans everywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Dudley died at age 89 after a stroke said his wife,  
Angie. He suffered from Alzheimer's disease and spent the last two 
years in a special care home in Tucson, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	A gifted storyteller, Dudley was covered the Indians from 1948,  
the year the team won its last World Series, until 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	He often used the term, ``The string is out,'' when the count on  
a batter would come to three balls and two strikes. He would end 
his broadcast with ``Lots of good luck, ya heah,'' his Southern 
voice filled with friendliness. 
</P>
<P>
	In recognition of his work, Dudley was inducted into the  
broadcasters' wing of the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, 
N.Y., in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Dudley, a native of Alexandria, Va., majored in chemistry at the  
University of Virginia. He served as a pilot in the Army Air Corps

<HEADLINE>  Announcer Jimmy Dudley Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- When Jimmy Dudley was working as an apprentice  
announcer on Chicago Cubs games, his lively, melodious voice caught 
the ear of a major sponsor of Cleveland Indians radio broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the man I want to do the Indians games,'' the chief of  
Erin Brew beer decided in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
	For the next 20 years, Dudley was the voice of the Cleveland  
Indians and greeted fans tuning in on the radio with ``Hello 
baseball fans everywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Dudley died at age 89 after a stroke said his wife,  
Angie. He suffered from Alzheimer's disease and spent the last two 
years in a special care home in Tucson, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	A gifted storyteller, Dudley was covered the Indians from 1948,  
the year the team won its last World Series, until 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	He often used the term, ``The string is out,'' when the count on  
a batter would come to three balls and two strikes. He would end 
his broadcast with ``Lots of good luck, ya heah,'' his Southern 
voice filled with friendliness. 
</P>
<P>
	In recognition of his work, Dudley was inducted into the  
broadcasters' wing of the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, 
N.Y., in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Dudley, a native of Alexandria, Va., majored in chemistry at the  
University of Virginia. He served as a pilot in the Army Air Corps 
during World War II and then turned to radio broadcasting after the 
war. 
</P>
<P>
	Dudley also did play-by-play for the Cleveland Browns in the  
1950s, for the Baltimore Colts and for Ohio State University

<HEADLINE> Ex-Nixon Adviser Ehrlichman Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- John D. Ehrlichman, President Nixon's domestic  
affairs adviser who was disgraced and imprisoned for his role in 
the Watergate cover-up that ultimately led to Nixon's resignation, 
has died. He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
	Ehrlichman died Sunday of natural causes at his home in Atlanta.  
He had suffered from diabetes, his son, Tom, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ehrlichman and Nixon's chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman, were  
virtually indistinguishable by the public. Both were close to Nixon 
and they became known as the ``Berlin Wall'' because they 
constituted a kind of palace guard that shielded the reclusive 
Nixon from unwelcome encounters. 
</P>
<P>
	Ehrlichman coined a phrase that became part of the nation's  
political lexicon when he advised Nixon to allow L. Patrick Gray 
3rd, then acting director of the FBI, to become the fall guy for 
Watergate and to leave him ``twisting slowly, slowly in the wind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In April 1973, as the cover-up began to unravel and pressure  
mounted, Nixon held a tearful meeting at his presidential retreat 
at Camp David, Md., with his two intimate and powerful advisers -- 
the iron-willed Haldeman and the self-controlled Ehrlichman. By 
that time, Nixon's counsel, John W. Dean 3rd, had implicated them 
in the Watergate cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, Nixon fired Dean, and accepted the resignations of  
Haldeman, Ehrlichman and Attorney General Richard Kleindienst. 
Nixon hoped that the sacrifices of his closest aides would stanch 
the scandal and spare him. 
</P>
<P>
	The cover-up was the attempt to conceal from the public the  
White House's involvement almost from the start in the break-in at 
Democratic Party headquarters at the Watergate office complex in 
Washington on June 17, 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	The burglars, quickly tied to Nixon's re-election campaign, were  
trying to replace a faulty telephone bugging device installed 
during an earlier break-in. They got caught when a security guard 
noticed they had taped a door to keep it from locking. He removed 
the tape, the burglars replaced it and the guard called the police. 
</P>
<P>
	Nixon won re-election that November but when he was forced by  
the Supreme Court to surrender the tape that showed his own early 
involvement in the cover-up, his impeachment became inevitable and 
a few days later, on Aug. 9, 1974, he became the first and only 
president to resign. His successor, Gerald Ford, pardoned him. 
</P>
<P>
	Ehrlichman went to prison in October 1976 and served 18 months  
of a four to eight year term for obstruction of justice, conspiracy 
and perjury. He lived in Santa Fe, N.M., before and after his 
prison term, wrote ``inside'' political novels and became a radio 
commentator. 
</P>
<P>
	His conviction grew out of his false testimony to a Senate  
committee and of a break-in in the Beverly Hills office of Dr. 
Lewis Fielding, a psychiatrist who had treated Daniel Ellsberg, the 
former Pentagon aide who leaked the Pentagon Papers to The New York 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Haldeman and John D. Mitchell, who had been Nixon's law partner  
and attorney general, also were among those imprisoned for their 
Watergate role. 
</P>
<P>
	``His role in Watergate should always be viewed against the  
historical backdrop of the culture war over Vietnam that was raging 
during the Nixon years,'' John H. Tayler, executive director of the 
Richard Nixon Library &AMP; Birthplace Foundation, said in a statement. 
``President Nixon wrote as follows in his memoirs: `I still believe 
that it is a tragedy of circumstances that ... John Ehrlichman went 
to jail and Daniel Ellsberg went free.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Ehrlichman never seemed able to escape the ghosts of Watergate  
and its effect on the public's impression of him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was never the person everybody saw in the Watergate  
hearings. But I have realized that I was never going to catch up 
with my image. It was set in concrete. It bothered me enormously 
for a while, what people thought of me,'' he told the Washington 
Post in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made myself stop caring because I knew I couldn't do a thing  
about it, and I knew it was going to tear me up if I tried.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview in 1982 to promote his memoir -- ``Witness to  
Power'' -- Ehrlichman minimized his own role in the scandal and said 
Nixon's character kept him from telling the truth about Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a question of weakness,'' Ehrlichman said. ``He simply  
could not bring himself to do something which I think he saw as 
delivering himself to his enemies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Herb Klein, director of communications in Nixon administration  
and now editor in chief of The Copley Newspapers, said: ``John 
Ehrlichman's arrogance in Watergate has become his legacy, but in 
fairness, he should be given credit for the fact that as President 
Nixon's top domestic advisor, he left a major record of school 
desegregation nationally and of progress toward welfare reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ehrlichman was born March 20, 1925, in Tacoma, Wash. He  
graduated from University of California, Los Angeles and got a law 
degree at Stanford University in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
	During World War II, he was a lead navigator in the 8th Air  
Force where he earned the Air Medal clusters and the Distinguished 
Flying Cross. Before joining the White House, Ehrlichman was a 
partner in the Seattle law firm of Hullin, Ehrlichman, Roberts &AMP; 
Hodge from 1952 to 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	Ehrlichman wrote four novels: ``The Company'' 1976; ``The Whole  
Truth'' 1979; ``The China Card'' 1986; (co-author) ``The Rigby 
File'' 1989. He also wrote a memoir which was published in 1983, 
``Witness to Power: The Nixon Years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He eventually moved to Atlanta, where he served as senior vice  
president of Law Environmental, an international engineering and 
environmental regulatory compliance firm. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife, Karen Hilliard, four sons and two  
daughters and his mother, Lillian. Funeral services will be 
private.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Arrives for Mexican Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MERIDA, Mexico (AP) -- From a cozy Valentine dinner between two  
couples to a summit of two leaders, President Clinton is making a 
neighborly call on Mexico to encourage its uphill battle with drug 
traffickers and promote purchases of U.S. exports. 
</P>
<P>
	His meetings today with President Ernesto Zedillo at the  
secluded Hacienda Temozon -- translated, aptly for this 23-hour 
visit, as ``Whirlwind Estate'' -- come only two weeks before Clinton 
must render a formal evaluation of Mexico's cooperation in fighting 
illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials traveling with Clinton tried to keep drugs from  
dominating headlines from the visit, which they described as 
``regular maintenance'' of relations with an important ally. 
</P>
<P>
	Export-Import Bank president James Harmon, part of a 52-member  
U.S. delegation, was here for Clinton's announcement today of a new 
two-year, $4 billion line of credit to Mexican businesses that 
``buy American,'' in an effort to increase the already bustling 
Mexican market for U.S. exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who joined Clinton from  
her weekend visit to the Paris peace talks on Kosovo, has not made 
her recommendations on the drug certifications, required under a 
1986 law. 
</P>
<P>
	But White House officials made plain in advance of Clinton's  
arrival in this city on the Yucatan Peninsula that he is likely to 
certify Mexico as an ally in fighting narcotics, as it has been for 
12 years. This would come despite Mexico's disappointing record on 
extraditions and a drop last year in cocaine and heroin seizures. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no doubt Mexico is doing everything it can to fight  
this massive problem,'' said National Security Council spokesman 
David Leavy. 
</P>
<P>
	A failing grade would mean tough economic sanctions on top of  
diplomatic insult to Mexico, which sees the U.S. certification 
process as political. 
</P>
<P>
	To that end, Clinton was here partly to gird Zedillo for a hard  
sell on Capitol Hill, where Congress can override his certification 
of Mexico. ``If history is any guide, we certainly anticipate a 
very difficult time'' in Congress, said deputy White House chief of 
staff Maria Echaveste. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico blames much of its drug problem on the United States,  
because Americans are the world's biggest buyers of illicit 
narcotics. About two-thirds of the cocaine sold in the United 
States comes through Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Today marks Clinton's second trip to Mexico as president and his  
seventh meeting with Zedillo. 
</P>
<P>
	They were expected to sign modest agreements to improve border  
safety, prevent cross-border pollution and tuberculosis infections, 
and train Mexico's soon-to-be-created federal police force, which 
is modeled after the FBI and meant to be a fresh start for the 
country's long-corrupt law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	They also planned to highlight booming economic trade in the  
five years since the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Eclipsing even Japan, Mexico has emerged as the second-largest  
foreign market for U.S. exports, after Canada. U.S. exports to 
Mexico total $79 billion a year, more than twice the pre-NAFTA 
figure. 
</P>
<P>
	For Clinton, the mission marked a passage into his  
post-impeachment presidency and brought an obvious sense of 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	He and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton lingered for three  
hours Sunday night over an intimate dinner with Zedillo and his 
wife, Nilda. 
</P>
<P>
	And, after months of avoiding reporters, the Clintons visited  
the press cabin of Air Force One on Sunday night, passing out 
chocolates from a huge heart-shaped box. 
</P>
<P>
	``Happy Valentine's Day,'' the president said. ``Isn't this the  
biggest heart you ever saw in your life? This is a better kind of 
heart of darkness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did not elaborate.

<HEADLINE> Expectations High as Yanks Open Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The challenge awaiting the New York Yankees  
can be seen on the back of the Legends Field scoreboard in big and 
bold letters. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a sign welcoming fans to the spring home of the 1998 World  
Series champions: ``The best team ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Against the backdrop of their 125-win season, the Yankees open  
spring training Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``At times, it seemed almost like an out-of-body experience,''  
vice president of player development Mark Newman said. ``You kept 
thinking something has got to end ... the Yankees can't win that 
many games. It was an eerie experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York went 114-48 during the regular season, setting an AL  
record for wins, then went 11-2 in the postseason, including a 
World Series sweep of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	The only player not back is outfielder Tim Raines, who signed  
with Oakland. The pressure to repeat last year's results will be 
staring at all the rest as they try to win their third Series title 
in four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an honor to be a part of that team because it's going to  
be compared to the greatest teams of all-time'' shortstop Derek 
Jeter said. ``After my first year (the 1996 world champion season), 
people were saying what can you do to top that. Once you win, you 
get spoiled and want to keep winning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York entered the offseason unsure of its future roster. But  
owner George Steinbrenner re-signed center fielder Bernie Williams 
($87.5 million for seven years), pitcher David Cone ($8 million for 
one year) and third baseman Scott Brosius ($15.75 million for three 
years), and exercised a $3.4 million option on catcher Joe Girardi. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our organization did a great job keeping everybody together  
and giving us another chance to win the World Series,'' first 
baseman Tino Martinez said. ``We've got a new year coming up and 
hopefully we can win the World Series again and match last year if 
we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees starting lineup appears set, except for what has  
become an annual battle for the left-field spot. Darryl Strawberry, 
who had a cancerous tumor removed from his colon last October, will 
be competing with Chad Curtis, Ricky Ledee and Shane Spencer. 
</P>
<P>
	Although starters Cone (36) and David Wells (35) are a year  
older, the pitching staff remains potent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody has an 0-and-0 record,'' Newman said, looking ahead  
to the start of formal workouts Thursday. ``The teams that didn't 
do well last year are buoyed by the hope that they will improve. 
And those that did well, us in particular, are concerned about 
repeating.''

<HEADLINE> American Airlines' Flights Resuming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- With a growing number of American Airlines pilots  
reporting for duty, airline officials think they can resume regular 
service this week. 
</P>
<P>
	As of late Sunday, ``well under 1,000'' of American's 9,400  
pilots were still listed as sick, compared to the nearly 2,500 
Thursday and Friday who declared themselves unfit to fly, an 
American spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just glad they are coming back and we hope by the end of  
the week to be in business as usual here,'' said Sonja Whitemon, 
adding that 100 percent service was possible by Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	However, about 231 flights, or about 10 percent, scheduled for  
today have been canceled because not all of the pilots were 
immediately available for flying. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half a million travelers have been left at the gate by  
the nation's second-largest airline since Feb. 6. That's when a 
large number of pilots started calling in sick in a dispute 
concerning how quickly American should integrate the pilots from 
recently purchased Reno Air into its own roster. 
</P>
<P>
	According to American, pilots have been taking themselves off of  
the sick list at a rapid rate since a federal judge held the Allied 
Pilots Association and two top board members in contempt of an 
order that pilots return to work. He promised sizable fines against 
the union. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the continued cancellations, most of the nation's  
airports were calmer Sunday with many passengers prepared for 
delays. 
</P>
<P>
	At Miami International Airport, heart-shaped decorations adorned  
American's baggage counter wall and musicians strolled through the 
terminal serenading passengers. But many travelers remained angry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I lost two to three years of age off my life,'' said  
Luis Delgado, a furniture exporter who faced delays in three cities 
over four days while trying to get home to Santo Domingo, Dominican 
Republic. ``This is not my problem, it's American Airlines. We 
don't have to be the ones that suffer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall said he would decide Wednesday  
how much to levy in fines. He required the union to place $10 
million with the court and for union president Rich LaVoy and vice 
president Brian Mayhew to remit a total of $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we are disappointed and disagree with Judge Kendall's  
order of contempt, we urge all pilots to comply with the 
restraining order,'' LaVoy said. ``We're taking his order 
seriously. I took his order seriously Wednesday night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations on the Reno pilot issue are scheduled to restart  
this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 6,000 flights have been canceled since the work action  
began, costing American between $67 million and $90 million, 
according to Chris Chiames, a spokesman for AMR Corp., parent 
company of American Airlines.

<HEADLINE> American Resumes Talks With Pilots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Most of American Airlines' flights took off as  
scheduled Monday as negotiations resumed between the company and 
its pilot union on the integration of recently purchased Reno Air. 
</P>
<P>
	American's parent company, AMR Corp., and the Allied Pilots  
Association headed back to the table in virtually the same place 
they were 10 days ago before pilots began calling in sick and 
refusing overtime, canceling thousands of flights and delaying 
travel for more than a half-million passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	About 800 of American's 9,400 pilots were still listed as sick  
Monday, compared to the nearly 2,500 who declared themselves unfit 
to fly Thursday and Friday, American officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 250 -- or roughly 11 percent -- of the 2,250 flights  
scheduled were canceled because some pilots weren't immediately 
available for flying. American spokesman John Hotard compared the 
impact on the airline's flight system to bad weather over the 
airline's Chicago, Miami or Dallas-Fort Worth hubs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fort Worth-based airline has canceled only 17 flights  
scheduled for Tuesday, Hotard said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to American, pilots have been taking themselves off  
the sick list at a rapid rate since a federal judge held the union 
and two top board members in contempt and promised sizable fines 
against them. 
</P>
<P>
	Some pilots complained that the number of pilots on the sick  
list could have been inflated because they had been trying to 
remove themselves, but normal procedures were suspended. Instead, 
they were told they had to meet with their chief medical officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Hotard said that was true for only 12 or 13 pilots who face  
possible disciplinary action for flying as passengers while they 
were on the sick list. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall threatened a ``significant''  
fine against the pilots' union Saturday, saying that the union did 
not do enough to encourage pilots to return to work after he 
ordered the union to end the sickout last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge required the union place $10 million, or one-quarter  
of the union's net worth, with the court in preparation of making 
his final decision this Wednesday. He also ordered union president 
Rich LaVoy and vice president Brian Mayhew to remit a total of 
$15,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 6,000 flights have been canceled since the work action  
began, costing American between $67 million and $90 million, 
according to Chris Chiames, a spokesman for AMR Corp. The final 
total has not been projected. 
</P>
<P>
	American also will see revenue reductions in the future. The  
airline said it will reduce its schedule 2 percent in the spring, 
or about 45-50 flights a day, because it does not believe pilots 
will volunteer for extra overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute is over how Reno Air pilots have been paid since AMR  
took control of the low-cost carrier last December. AMR wants to 
pay the pilots higher rates as they are retrained, but the union 
believes their contract guarantees the pilots are paid more from 
the purchase date. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Reno pilots' pay is half the $164,000 a year that an  
experienced American pilot is paid. AMR said the pilot union's 
demands to add Reno pilots to the higher pay scale quickly would 
cost as much as $50 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides said the sickout had not changed their original  
negotiating positions. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, neither the company or union has requested a federal  
mediator or binding arbitration in the dispute.

<HEADLINE> Jokes Have Always Filled Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- George Washington had no sooner dipped a  
silver trowel in mortar to lay the Capitol cornerstone than the 
city he founded became the butt of scoffers, cynics and scolds. 
</P>
<P>
	``A monument raised to a deceased project,'' Charles Dickens  
huffed in 1842. ``Grand, gloomy and peculiar,'' another writer 
mused in 1848. ``A vast practical joke,'' an exasperated English 
newspaper correspondent sputtered during the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
	Complaints about the city of Washington and those who govern  
here started early and have never ceased. 
</P>
<P>
	The scornful at first directed their needles at the puffed-up  
pretentiousness of a 10-mile-square patch of brush and swamp, with 
an unfinished, domeless Capitol and virtually no creature comforts, 
claiming itself as the capital of a self-respecting nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Boosters envisioned the reincarnation of ancient Rome.  
Detractors saw the city as a mouse with delusions of grandeur. 
</P>
<P>
	``This embryo Capital, where Fancy sees, squares in morasses,  
obelisks in trees,'' declaimed visiting English poet Thomas Moore 
in 1806, six years after the government moved in. 
</P>
<P>
	Created expressly as a federal district apart from any state,  
Washington had no past, hardly any present and an extremely cloudy 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	As the city's first century unreeled and Washington City made  
itself an enduring fact, the complaints shifted to the character of 
the government the city housed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Persons who love dissipation, persons who love to watch the  
game of politics, and those who make a study of strong minds under 
great excitement like a season in Washington,'' travel writer 
Harriet Martineau asserted in 1838. 
</P>
<P>
	The British soldiers who torched the place in 1814 fanned the  
fires with derision. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. James Scott called the burned-out White House no great loss.  
It was, he declared, ``remarkable for nothing, except the want of 
taste.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The city that rose from the fire got no slack from the travelers  
who followed the British army. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole affair ... looks as though some giant had scattered  
a lot of child's toys at random,'' Capt. Basil Hall wrote in 1827. 
``Everything wears the appearance of poverty and want of 
permanency,'' Charles Francis Adams told his diary seven years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	``The town looks like a large straggling village reared in a  
drained swamp,'' said traveler George Combe in 1838. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Dickens, visiting in 1842, found the Capitol stained  
with the juice of chewed tobacco. The carpets were so drenched and 
filthy that anything dropped on them should be left there, even a 
wallet, he cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
	As to the place itself, Dickens wrote, it is ``a city of  
magnificent intentions,'' none of them realized. 
</P>
<P>
	``Washington offers a clinching proof of the proposition that  
one cannot bring a great city into existence by mere will power,'' 
said French scientist Jean-Jacques Ampere in 1851. 
</P>
<P>
	The Civil War brought Washington danger and confusion and more  
complaints than ever: dust, dirt, squalor, noise. 
</P>
<P>
	``I found the Capital still under the reign of King Mud ...,''  
British novelist Anthony Trollope wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``If one were to judge the American people by their capital, one  
would have a very poor opinion of them,'' a visiting Frenchman, 
Ernest Duvergier de Hauranne, said in 1864. 
</P>
<P>
	``Washington will be, I have no doubt, someday uproariously  
splendid, but at present it isn't anything. It is in the District 
of Columbia and the state of the future ...,'' George Agustus Sala, 
a correspondent for the London Telegraph, observed in 1865. 
</P>
<P>
	Sala emptied his bucket of disdain to produce this: ``a great,  
scrambling, slack-baked embryo of a city basking in the December 
sun like an alligator of a mud bank of a bayou in July.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By century's end the mud had dried and the government at  
Washington did its best to rule. 
</P>
<P>
	And the complaining continued.  
</P>
<P>
	``The progress of Evolution from President Washington to  
President Grant was alone evidence enough to upset Darwin,'' wrote 
Henry Adams, whose own family included the second and sixth 
presidents. 
</P>
<P>
	``My God! What is there in this place that a man should ever  
want to get into it?'' James Garfield asked in 1881. 
</P>
<P>
	Leave the last words to Mark Twain as Washington's first century  
ended. 
</P>
<P>
	``Suppose you were an idiot. And suppose you were a member of  
Congress. But I repeat myself.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Father of Jets QB Testaverde Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Al Testaverde, who realized his lifelong dream  
when his son, Vinny, became the quarterback for the hometown New 
York Jets, has died of a heart attack in Florida. He was 66. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Testaverde was vacationing with his wife, Josie, in  
Fort Lauderdale, when he was stricken on Sunday, Jets spokesman 
Frank Ramos said. Ramos was unable to provide further details. 
</P>
<P>
	Al Testaverde was Vinny's best friend and biggest fan,  
celebrating the good times and the bad, from his son's Heisman 
Trophy season of 1986 at the University of Miami to the poor 
seasons toiling for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
	This past season was the best of everything for the Testaverdes,  
who couldn't be prouder of their son after he stepped in as the 
Jets starting quarterback and nearly led them to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	At 35, Vinny Testaverde, who dedicated his Heisman to his  
father, made the Pro Bowl and Big Al, as he was affectionately 
known, was the happiest man on the planet. 
</P>
<P>
	On visits to local restaurants in Elmont, N.Y., which lies in  
the shadow of Belmont Park, one of his favorite haunts, Al 
Testaverde always had a smile on his face when he talked about ``my 
Vincent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so proud of him, words can't describe it,'' Big Al would  
say. ``I've been blessed to have such a wonderful son.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Al Testaverde was a regular at Jets training camp at Hofstra,  
about 20 minutes from his home, and often drove his son home for 
lunch and dinner. The license plates on Al's car read 
``HEISMAN86.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Al appeared on the ``Rosie O'Donnell Show'' to talk  
about his son's success. 
</P>
<P>
	Al Testaverde had a history of heart problems, though. He  
suffered a heart attack at Tampa Stadium in 1987, and hadn't 
watched his son play a game in person since. He would watch tapes 
of the games, but only after he found out the score. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Jets were winning the AFC East, though, Big Al was  
tempted to go to a game but knew his doctors wouldn't allow it. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before the Jets played Denver in the AFC title, he said  
he'd go to Miami for the Super Bowl if the Jets were in it. Denver 
won 23-10, but Vinny Testaverde was the talk of the town as he 
compiled a 13-2 record after replacing Glenn Foley as the Jets 
starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Vinny makes it to the Super Bowl, I'll go to the game in  
Miami,' ' Al Testaverde had told The Journal News recently. ``If 
I'm going to die, that would be the way I'd want to go, with a 
smile, watching my son pay in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like my life has been fulfilled. Everything I've wished  
for my son this season has come true. I feel as if I've won 20 
Super Bowls because of the character Vinny's shown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vinny Testaverde flew from his home in Tampa, Fla., to handle  
funeral arrangements. A private wake will be held Tuesday and 
Wednesday for family and friends and funeral services will be 
Thursday at undisclosed sites in Elmont, where the Testaverdes 
lived for the past 32 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides his son and wife, Al Testaverde is survived by four  
daughters and 10 grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> US Draws Denmark in Women's Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Even as the matches for the Women's  
World Cup this summer were being set, organizers were pleading with 
fans around the country to show their support for the biggest 
women-only sporting event in history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Come this summer and fill the stadiums and excite young girls  
all over the world,'' said Donna de Varona, chair of the organizing 
committee for the 32-match tournament that will run from June 
19-July 10 in seven U.S. cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States drew North Korea, Nigeria and Denmark in its  
group for first-round matches. The Americans have six wins and a 
tie in their 10 games against Denmark, while the U.S. squad has 
never played North Korea or Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could call this the unknown group, because we really don't  
know North Korea or Nigeria very well,'' U.S. coach Tony DiCicco 
said after Sunday night's draw. ``Denmark has been a strong, 
physical opponent for us in the past, and will be a good test for 
us in the opener.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tiffeny Milbrett, a forward on the U.S. team, said the Americans  
are more comfortable with Denmark than with the other nations in 
their group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Personally, I am a little scared of unknown teams,'' Milbrett  
said. ``Often those types of teams are scrappy teams. And scrappy 
teams' strengths tend to match up against our weaknesses pretty 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The draw resulted in confusion about which nation the Americans  
will play in their opening match, and got more confusing when 
officials switched around two groups for marketing reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	FIFA president Sepp Blatter announced during the draw ceremony,  
televised live throughout the United States, that the U.S. team 
will face North Korea in its opening match June 19 at Giants 
Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	But Women's World Cup officials later said the U.S. team will  
face Denmark in that opening match. The Americans will play Nigeria 
at Chicago's Soldier Field on June 24 and complete their 
first-round matches against North Korea at Foxboro Stadium outside 
Boston on June 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers also switched around two groups. China originally was  
announced as the top-seeded team in Group C and Norway, the 
defending champion, as the top-seeded team in Group D. But those 
group assignments later were switched, with Norway heading up Group 
C and China leading Group D. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the schedule released weeks ago, the top team in  
Group D is scheduled to play its first match in San Jose and the 
top team in Group C will play its first game at Foxboro. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers said they decided to switch the group assignments  
because they wanted China to play its opener in the San Francisco 
Bay area, which has a large Asian community. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decision was made for local marketing reasons by the  
Women's World Cup organizing committee based on the tremendous 
Chinese population in northern California and the interest we 
received from different Chinese organizations to bring the team to 
this venue,'' said Steve Vanderpool, vice president of 
communications for the Women's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The draw was held at halftime of a match won 2-1 by a squad of  
world all-stars against the U.S. national team. Charmaine Hooper of 
Canada scored twice in the second half for the world all-stars. 
Julie Foudy scored the U.S. goal midway through the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. midfielder Michelle Akers left the game in the first half,  
her face bloodied, and was taken to a hospital after bumping heads 
with a world all-star player on a jump ball situation in front of 
the world all-stars' goal. She had a severe cut over her left 
eyebrow and a bruised cheekbone. 
</P>
<P>
	Blatter, head of soccer's world governing body, has said  
repeatedly that ``the future of football is feminine'' and said 
Sunday that female soccer players have a distinct advantage over 
their male counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't cheat. They don't grip the shirt. They don't feign  
a foul,'' Blatter said. ``It's not like the men, who lie on the 
field and are taken off the field on a stretcher and 30 seconds 
later they're running faster than ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Women's World Cup will have games in or near Boston,  
Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco/San Jose, Washington, 
D.C., and Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States won the inaugural Women's World Cup in 1991 in  
China. Norway won the title in 1995 in Sweden.

<HEADLINE> Group Protests Fat-Bashing Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- If space aliens land on Earth, would they  
demand ``Take me to your leader'' or ``Take me to your eater''? 
</P>
<P>
	That's the question behind a billboard ad campaign by 24 Hour  
Fitness which depicts a hungry space alien with the caption, ``When 
they come, they will eat the fat ones first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That month-old slogan has infuriated more than 30 ``fat rebels''  
who came out Monday to protest the ad and the anti-fat ethos they 
say is prevalent in many gyms. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really hard for fat people to get into the gym anyway. To  
alienate them before they even walk in the door is cruel,'' said 
Rebekah Bridges, who handed out lollipops to passers-by. 
</P>
<P>
	``I may be fat, but I'm fit, I'm happy, I'm sexual. I'm all of  
those things. How dare an ad-man decide for society that we're not 
allowed to be someplace,'' Ms. Bridges said. 
</P>
<P>
	She was joined on the sidewalk by several other larger women and  
men who chanted ``Eat me!'' 
</P>
<P>
	A fitness trainer for the rival World Gym even ran an impromptu  
aerobics session during the sidewalk protest, leading four 
participants through a rigorous high-kneed, arm-pumping routine. 
</P>
<P>
	Others waved handwritten signs that read ``Fat and Fit'' and  
``Honk If You're Fat,'' which received loud support from traffic on 
the busy downtown street. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials say they didn't intend to offend anyone.  
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes humor helps make things easier, and can even be  
motivational,'' 24 Hour Fitness said in a statement. Carlsbad-based 
24 Hour Fitness has 284 gyms in 10 western states, Europe and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Marilyn Wann, who organized the protest, said the company's ad  
isn't funny, and took her ``fat rebels'' to the front lines to be 
seen and heard. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got an epidemic of eating disorders, an epidemic of  
exercise disorders, people who have to work out twice a day or 
they're not worthy human beings,'' Ms. Wann said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Jancula, a club member for 12 years who works out twice a  
week, said the ad was heavy-handed. ``I thought the ad was very 
inappropriate. It was stupid,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Wann said she'd like to see the company retract the ads and  
work with fat advocates to fill out its membership. ``It really 
makes me sad to think the fitness isn't about health, they're just 
about looks,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Woods Regains Winning Touch  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- It had been a while since Tiger Woods stood on  
an 18th green on a Sunday afternoon, both arms raised in triumph. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost nine months to the day since his last victory, Woods  
rolled in a 15-foot eagle putt to beat scrappy Billy Ray Brown by 
two strokes in the Buick Invitational. Woods lifted both arms, then 
hugged Brown after the two battled for most of the final 18 holes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buick field wasn't exactly overpowering, but Woods' golf was  
riveting, and one thing he said he'll remember from this one was 
that he shot 17-under over the weekend. On Friday, he needed 
birdies on his final two holes just to make the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	He went into Saturday's round nine back, but tamed Torrey Pines  
South with a course-record 62, which also happened to be his lowest 
round as a pro. He followed that with a 65 Sunday, finally beating 
Brown after the two went into No. 18 tied at 20-under-par. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods finished at 22-under 266, tying George Burns' 1987  
tournament record for Torrey Pines. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was Tiger's tournament to lose,'' Brown said. ``All I could  
do was go free-wheel and he's the guy who had pressure on him. And 
you see how he responded to the pressure. An eagle on the last hole 
is just indicative of the kind of player he is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods said he didn't lose confidence in the 14-tournament span  
in which his best finishes were a pair of thirds. At the same time, 
David Duval was becoming golf's hottest player. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately for me, I haven't been winning as much as David  
has. I haven't been playing as well, either,'' Woods said. ``It's 
just a matter of time before everything comes around and some 
breaks start going my way. In order to win, you have to get lucky 
breaks, no doubt about it. And this week I got my share.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest was on the par-5 No. 6 on Saturday, when his  
difficult 3-wood shot from a knoll next to a bunker bounced off a 
sprinkler head and shot onto the green, setting up a 10-foot eagle 
putt. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are little things that, if it kicks the other way, hits  
soft or if it kicked right and ended up in the rough, I'd have made 
par, and that would have been a momentum killer right there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Woods also was on with his short game and his putter. After  
his round Saturday, he said he feels more confident when he's 
playing badly. ``More importantly, my short game has improved where 
I don't mind missing the green as much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he also said his goal was to hit 18 greens, ``no matter  
what. Whether it's 40 feet or 4 feet, it doesn't matter. I figured 
I could knock it down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He needed just 24 putts on Saturday, 28 on Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't hit a lot of great shots today, but I hit a lot of  
great putts,'' Woods said after the victory, noting that his one 
blunder was three-putting the par-3 11th. ``Basically, that was the 
story of the entire week. I didn't hit the ball as well as I like, 
but I drove it great the entire week. I made everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Buick win solidified Woods' No. 1 spot on the Official World  
Golf Ranking released Monday. The rankings were used to select the 
field for the $5 million Andersen Consulting Match Play 
Championship next week at La Costa. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods widened his gap over Duval, who skipped the Buick, and  
will face Nick Faldo in the first round of the Match Play 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods, though, said the rankings aren't important.  
</P>
<P>
	``Winning golf tournaments is what's important. Winning golf  
tournaments, basically, keeps you No. 1 in the world. There's no 
substitute for winning, there's no doubt about that. I haven't won 
on the PGA Tour since May of last year, but to finally win again, 
that feels a lot better than any world ranking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods was in a comfort zone because he was back in his native  
Southern California. His homecoming tour resumes this weekend in 
the Nissan Open at Riviera before moving to La Costa, where Woods 
won a one-hole playoff over Tom Lehman in the rain-shortened 1997 
Mercedes Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old Woods said it's important to have family members  
and friends in the gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't get to see it every week as you travel all over the  
world. Most of the time you're alone, you and your caddy. But to 
have the people who are close to you out there supporting you the 
entire way, it means a lot.''

<HEADLINE>  Kosovo Talks Enter Final Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- The Kosovo peace conference headed  
into a high-pressure final week with the United States bearing down 
hard on the Serbs to make a deal with rival ethnic Albanians or 
suffer NATO's wrath. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbian President Milan Milutinovic reiterated his objections to  
foreign troops backing any deal and said NATO bombing raids, in the 
absence of an agreement, would amount to ``a war crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov arrived today to try his  
hand at speeding up the talks between Serbs and Kosovo Albanians at 
the 14th century French chateau outside Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians are pushing just as hard for a resolution of the  
Kosovo conflict by a Saturday deadline, but Moscow adamantly 
opposes the use of NATO airstrikes if the talks fail. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivanov told reporters after meeting with both delegations that  
he was convinced ``they realize the importance of the moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to emphasize, once again, that only a political  
settlement is possible,'' he said. ``There is no military solution 
to this problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright berated  
Milutinovic in Paris in what Serbian sources described as an 
extremely unpleasant meeting. She then came out to the site of the 
talks in Rambouillet, 30 miles southwest of Paris, and dragged both 
sides to the table. 
</P>
<P>
	The Albanians, she said later, seemed to accept the plan drafted  
by the United States and five European countries as a ``fair 
deal,'' and appeared ready to sign it by the end of the week. The 
best she could say for the Serbs was that they seemed to appreciate 
the consequences of a deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
	Milutinovic, in a news conference today, lashed out at the  
threat of NATO airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bombing can't resolve anything,'' he said. ``It would be an  
aggression against a sovereign country, a war crime and a crime 
against humanity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At stake is the future of Kosovo, a poor southern province of  
Serbia, the dominant of the two remaining republics in Yugoslavia 
and home to 2 million people, 90 percent of whom are ethnic 
Albanians. An estimated 2,000 people have died since a major 
outbreak of fighting began a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-year plan for Kosovo is designed to end the fighting,  
compel Serbia to withdraw most of its troops from Kosovo and set up 
elections to clear the way for some autonomy for ethnic Albanians.

<P>
	A NATO peacekeeping force of 25,000 troops, including about  
4,000 Americans, would take charge of collecting weapons and 
storing them while keeping the sides apart so the election could 
proceed in a secure environment.

are faced with this historic opportunity, that the killing must 
stop, that time is short,'' Albright said after bringing Albanian

Hill had been shuttling between the two delegations on separate

mission, civilian or military, is possible only on consent of 
Belgrade,'' the Russian news agency quoted Ivanov as saying.

both sides.

<HEADLINE>  Kosovo Talks Enter Final Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- The Kosovo peace conference headed  
into a high-pressure final week with the United States bearing down 
hard on the Serbs to make a deal with rival ethnic Albanians or 
suffer NATO's wrath. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbian President Milan Milutinovic reiterated his objections to  
foreign troops backing any deal and said NATO bombing raids, in the 
absence of an agreement, would amount to ``a war crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov arrived today to try his  
hand at speeding up the talks between Serbs and Kosovo Albanians at 
the 14th century French chateau outside Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians are pushing just as hard for a resolution of the  
Kosovo conflict by a Saturday deadline, but Moscow adamantly 
opposes the use of NATO airstrikes if the talks fail. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivanov told reporters after meeting with both delegations that  
he was convinced ``they realize the importance of the moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to emphasize, once again, that only a political  
settlement is possible,'' he said. ``There is no military solution 
to this problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright berated  
Milutinovic in Paris in what Serbian sources described as an 
extremely unpleasant meeting. She then came out to the site of the 
talks in Rambouillet, 30 miles southwest of Paris, and dragged both 
sides to the table. 
</P>
<P>
	The Albanians, she said later, seemed to accept the plan drafted  
by the United States and five European countries as a ``fair 
deal,'' and appeared ready to sign it by the end of the week. The 
best she could say for the Serbs was that they seemed to appreciate 
the consequences of a deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
	Milutinovic, in a news conference today, lashed out at the  
threat of NATO airstrikes.

<HEADLINE>  3 Designers Take Center Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Three things count in the business of fashion:  
timing, timing, timing. 
</P>
<P>
	That is why American designers are staging their fall Fashion  
Week previews six weeks earlier than usual. 
</P>
<P>
	Fall in February? What's the hurry?  
</P>
<P>
	Ask nearly any designer here: It's good to be the early bird.  
The unprecedented jump-start was prompted by an itch to leapfrog in 
front of the London, Paris and Milan shows. Those fashion capitals 
normally play a gig of openings for an international audience of 
retailers, editors and photographers before sending the weary 
traveling circus packing for the openings here. 
</P>
<P>
	Designers stateside say they want to be judged without being  
compared to the rest of the pack. Besides, they say, having second 
billing typically means receiving more accusations of copying the 
front-runners, having less time for production and delivery, and 
fewer dollars for the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a slight puffing of the chest, now that Americans can  
compete on a world level and didn't have to be last in the ring of 
shows,'' says Stan Herman, president of 7th on Sixth, which 
coordinates Fashion Week. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the nearly 80 semiannual previews are centralized at  
tents at Bryant Park, a bit of midtown greenery behind the New York 
Public Library. On Monday, fashion fans gathered there to glimpse 
the glamour gowns of Caracas-born Carolina Herrera, celebrated for 
having dressed Hillary Clinton, Jacqueline Kennedy and Whitney 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are so many occasions, especially in New York, no?''  
says Herrera. That's why she stands ready to lavish her customers 
with pullover sweaters made entirely of mink, dresses fairly 
dripping in ostrich and mohair skirts spangled with sequins. 
</P>
<P>
	But not everything on the runways is for ladies of renown. Or  
for ladies at all. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, both women's and men's shows have been  
consolidated into the Fashion Week schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	At some shows, the runway is coed. Sunday's curtain-raiser, for  
example, was Donna Karan's DKNY line of men's and women's clothes 
built for comfort. DKNY, which runs about 50 percent below the 
price of Donna Karan collection, puts a sporty spin on sportswear. 
</P>
<P>
	For women, there are baggy ``cotton slip cover duvet'' coats,  
which indeed resemble down-filled comforters. For men, the line 
offers hoods, wool cargo pants and drawstrings on nylon pullovers 
to underscore the athletic influence. 
</P>
<P>
	Cynthia Rowley, who showed Sunday at Grand Central Terminal, was  
headed for more exotic destinations. ``I have cashmere sweaters 
from Mongolia, sequins from Paris and beading from India,'' she 
said of her embellished women's wear. Even men's snowboard pants 
were teamed with sparkly mohair sweaters. 
</P>
<P>
	But some outfits were sparse, most notably the one worn by  
``Cabaret'' star Alan Cumming, who ended the show bare-chested, in 
a red taffeta ball skirt. He still didn't look quite as fetching as 
front row members Salma Hayek, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Natasha 
Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	This season's New York schedule was prompted by German designer  
Helmut Lang. His decision to relocate here and show early during 
last fall's round of Fashion Week created a domino effect, 
inspiring a dozen American designers to likewise jump the gun. 
</P>
<P>
	But not every New York designer is here. Bill Blass and Geoffrey  
Beene are showing in April. Both cite late fabric deliveries. 
Blass' delay also stems from his December hospitalization following 
a mild stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	But in one crucial context, being last has its distinctions:  
This week's previews represent fall 1999/winter 2000 -- the final 
collections of the millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	The collections wrap up Friday with Calvin Klein.  
</P>
<P>
	What's next on the fashion roster?  
</P>
<P>
	``With so much change, it is hard to know who is going to  
leapfrog next over whom,'' says Herman. 
</P>
<P>
	He's hardly the only one speculating.  
</P>
<P>
	``In the future,'' says New York designer Randolph Duke, ``we  
may be looking at fashion two years ahead. I could see it 
happening. Like, I could be working now on my collection for 2004 
and saying, `I'm seeing pink.'''

<HEADLINE> Rodman Remains Out of Sight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Worm remained out of sight Monday, with  
no word from the Los Angeles Lakers on when -- or if -- Dennis Rodman 
would join the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard he's coming,'' Shaquille O'Neal said after another  
practice came and went without an appearance from the seven-time 
defending rebounding champion. 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to the Lakers told The Associated Press late  
Sunday that Rodman was expected to sign with the team by Tuesday 
and be in uniform for that night's game against Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	Lakers executives Jerry West and Mitch Kupchak have been talking  
with Rodman's agents, team spokesman John Black said, but added 
that there was ``absolutely nothing new to report.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A couple hours earlier, Black answered his home telephone by  
saying, ``Dennis Rodman Hotline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Already, the buzz over the expected arrival of the league's most  
colorful character may have become a distraction to the team. A 
loss Sunday to the Indiana Pacers dropped the Lakers to 3-3, 
leaving them in a three-way tie for third place in the Pacific 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
	Derek Harper, at 37 the oldest player on the team and the same  
age as Rodman, said over the weekend that ``any distraction was 
going to be a cancer for this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a big deal to me,'' Harper said Monday when asked if  
he was tiring of all the questions. ``I'm pretty focused on what's 
going on around here and what I'm trying to accomplish here. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he can help us as a player here. If and when it  
happens, it happens. That's the only approach you can have. We 
haven't, I haven't, talked about it with anybody except the 
media.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers first expressed an interest in Rodman two weeks ago.  
</P>
<P>
	They can only offer the veterans' minimum of $1 million,  
prorated for this lockout-shortened season, and that money is 
diminishing with every game Rodman misses. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting Tuesday night, they'll play six games in eight days.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'll just leave that up to everybody else to talk  
about,'' Lakers coach Del Harris said when asked about Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be honest, I haven't heard too much about it,'' forward  
Corie Blount said. ``I haven't heard the players talk about it, the 
coaches. It doesn't really count until the coach comes to us and 
tells us we have a new player on the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman has played on five of the last 10 NBA champions,  
including the last three with the Chicago Bulls, who opted not to 
pursue him last month after Michael Jordan announced his 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives for Rodman's new agents from International  
Creative Management could not be reached Monday.

<HEADLINE> Dartmouth Frats Re-Assess Values </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Fraternities and sororities at Dartmouth  
College are about brotherhood and sisterhood, community service, 
tradition and connections that will last a lifetime, according to 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	They also promote sexual assault, racial divisions and a social  
scene that revolves around alcohol, according to critics. 
</P>
<P>
	So when the Ivy League school's trustees announced sweeping  
changes in campus social life last week, including a proposal to 
eliminate the traditional fraternity and sorority system that was 
spoofed in the film ``Animal House,'' they touched off a culture 
war. 
</P>
<P>
	``The campus is pretty well polarized between people that drink  
and people that don't drink,'' said Ed Bialas, 19, a member of the 
Alpha Delta fraternity who comes from Bardonia, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	The move attracted attention far beyond Hanover, a northern New  
Hampshire town of about 9,000 near the Vermont line. 
</P>
<P>
	Although a half-dozen small, private colleges in the Northeast  
have made their fraternities and sororities go coed over the last 
three decades, the number of single-sex fraternity chapters 
nationwide is actually growing, according to Jonathan Brant, 
executive vice president of the National Interfraternity Conference 
in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is far from a trend,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	College President James Wright acknowledged last week that  
problems such as excessive and illegal drinking cannot be blamed 
entirely on fraternities and sororities. But, he said, ``there is a 
recognition that these single-sex organizations play far too 
dominant a role in social life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fraternity and sorority members say banning or dramatically  
changing their organizations won't solve those problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that forcing organizations to become coed will  
suddenly sensitize everyone, and I don't think that women should be 
put in men's houses to `civilize' them,'' said Jaimie Paul, 
president of the Coed Fraternity Sorority Council. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1769, Dartmouth is the northernmost of the Ivy League  
schools. About 35 percent of it 4,300 undergraduates are members of 
25 fraternities and sororities. There are also three coed 
fraternities, but they are small. 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone acknowledges that fraternity and sorority parties are  
central to campus social life, but not everyone likes it that way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would be nice to have somewhere people could talk  
or party where there wasn't all this drinking and rampant 
sexuality,'' said Calmita Fields, 21, of Drexel Hill, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration says it is willing to spend tens of millions  
of dollars building new social spaces, dining areas and small, 
clustered residences, and it is seeking student suggestions. 
Dartmouth also would like to buy the fraternity houses it doesn't 
already own to give it more control, Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, many fraternities and sororities hold open parties  
featuring free alcohol and kegs. That makes it easy for students to 
drink to excess -- ``and they do,'' said Kate Burke, acting senior 
associate dean. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraternity and sorority members acknowledge there are problems.  
But the college should give a new alcohol policy enacted last year 
a chance to work, Paul said. It requires all new members of 
fraternities and sororities to attend alcohol and sexual abuse 
workshops, and requires groups holding parties to take steps to 
keep alcohol out of reach of underage guests. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul argued that the college will have to work with the Greek  
system -- so called because of the Greek letters used in fraternity 
and sorority names -- or it will drive it underground and 
off-campus, where drinking will be much harder to monitor and could 
lead to drunken driving accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's only so much you can regulate,'' she said. ``Students  
here will find a way to get alcohol.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many women also say abolishing sorority houses would take away  
safe spaces for women. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know women in the houses who just don't like dealing with  
the pressures of men being around,'' said Lisa Kahn, 20, a sorority 
member from Glen Rock, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Dartmouth, which went coeducational in 1972, had a reputation as  
a terrible place for women students until they began to band 
together and form their own social clubs. Chris Miller, a member of 
Alpha Delta when he was a Dartmouth student, co-wrote ``Animal 
House,'' the 1978 film comedy about frat-house debauchery. 
</P>
<P>
	Dartmouth's frats may no longer fit the ``Animal House''  
stereotype. But the college's concerns are well-founded, said Henry 
Wechsler, director of college alcohol studies at Harvard's School 
of Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
	National surveys show 80 percent of fraternity and sorority  
members who live in their houses are binge drinkers, downing four 
or five drinks in a row at least once every two weeks, compared 
with 40 percent of college students overall, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Residence in a fraternity or sorority is the single strongest  
predictor of binge drinking in college,'' Wechsler said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been hearing these promises from fraternities for years  
about how they're going to change, how they're going to go dry, how 
they're going to alter their environment, but it hasn't happened,'' 
he said. ``They need help doing it -- they can't do it themselves.'' 
</P>

	Brant disagreed. He said the amount of binge drinking on  
campuses nationwide is scary, but Dartmouth's ``top-down approach'' 
to ending it won't work, especially in a society that portrays 
alcohol use as sexy. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't make students do what you want them to do -- you  
really have to get them to buy into the idea and take ownership of 
it,'' he said. ``Right now, students are convinced alcohol is the 
only way they can have fun.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Aretha Franklin in Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Despite earning millions from her 40-year career  
as the Queen of Soul, Aretha Franklin continues to be dogged by 
debt, according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1988, more than 30 lawsuits have been filed against  
Franklin, with the total sought just over $1 million, the Detroit 
Free Press reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some cases were settled, and some Franklin paid only after being  
taken to court, most recently in January. She occasionally ignored 
court judgments, forcing creditors to seek liens on homes or 
assets, according to the Free Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Franklin, her lawyer and her publicist refused to be interviewed  
for the article. 
</P>
<P>
	Some creditors say Franklin -- whose hits include ``Respect,''  
``Think,'' and ``Freeway of Love'' -- is just a spoiled diva. 
</P>
<P>
	But friends say she distrusts outsiders after a difficult  
experience as a teen-ager starting in the music business, a failed 
first marriage, and the loss of her father, brother and a sister, 
who all died in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's a wonderful artist who shouldn't be handling her own  
business, but she does,'' said Wayne County Judge Harvey Tennen, 
who represented Franklin in the 1980s. ``People have taken 
advantage of her whole life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franklin keeps her income private. She signed a $1.2 million  
book deal in 1995 for an autobiography and a $10 million record 
deal the following year. 
</P>
<P>
	Many claims against her are for $4,000 for less. State and  
federal officials have also levied $1.2 million in liens, but she 
paid off nearly all of them, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of her creditors said they were reluctant to bring lawsuits  
because they were fans and admired Franklin's contributions to 
music and to Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``She did a lot of charity work, and I didn't want to embarrass  
her,'' said Frank Winton, a caterer who sued Franklin in 1988 over 
a $2,300 bill for four parties. He put off suing for months and 
hesitated to mention the debt at social functions.

<HEADLINE> Rep. Kasich To Run for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Rep. John Kasich, the chairman of the  
House Budget Committee and a vocal proponent of reducing the 
deficit, has two states in his sights: New Hampshire and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich announced plans to file papers today with the Federal  
Election Commission to formally establish the formation of a 
presidential exploratory committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just a little different and a little fresher than a lot of  
the people who are in politics now,'' Kasich, 46, said Sunday on 
NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich joins Sen. John McCain of Arizona, conservative activist  
Gary Bauer, former Vice President Dan Quayle and former Secretary 
of Education Lamar Alexander as Republicans with exploratory 
committees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Early polls and name ID don't mean anything,'' Kasich told the  
television program. ``Politics is ever-changing. I don't worry 
about the polls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ninth-term Republican was scheduled to leave Ohio after a  
breakfast speech today and a rally at Port Columbus International 
Airport. From there he will fly to New Hampshire and Iowa, the 
states that set the primary front-runners. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich described himself as a different kind of Republican  
candidate, one who is not capitalizing on famous relatives or 
personal wealth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a mailman's son from a blue-collar community near  
Pittsburgh,'' Kasich said. ``I got into politics because I wanted 
to change the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich readily admits that he probably won't be able to match  
other candidates' fund-raising skills, but has said he should be 
able to run a credible campaign for less than the $20 million 
believed to be a minimum budget for a national campaign in next 
year's primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	He plans to build recognition and a donor base with the help of  
the Internet, cable television and some offbeat antics, such as a 
bowling alley tour of Iowa later this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	As chairman of the House Budget Committee, Kasich has headed an  
effort to cut $100 billion in spending by 2003, an effort that's 
drawn fire from Democrats and the White House and made many 
Republicans nervous.

<HEADLINE> Activists Protest NYPD Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Protesting the shooting by New York City  
police of an unarmed black immigrant, a group of civil rights 
activists called Monday for an examination of police violence 
against blacks nationwide. ``Enough is enough,'' they declared. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got to rein in these officers of the law who are  
killing black people,'' said Rev. Walter Fauntroy, a former 
District of Columbia delegate to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting is being investigated by the Bronx district  
attorney's office, but federal officials are already involved. The 
U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White in New York has begun a separate 
investigation, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation has said it 
is assisting the Bronx attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
	About 400 protesters started outside the White House and then  
marched to the Justice Department and the U.S. Capitol. Federal 
offices were closed for Presidents Day. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to see to it that an end is brought to this police  
violence against people of African-American ancestry,'' said Mark 
Thompson, who chairs an NAACP criminal justice task force. The 
protesters called for stiffer federal laws against police officers 
who target citizens because of their race or ethnic background. 
</P>
<P>
	The protest was sparked by the Feb. 4 fatal shooting of Amadou  
Diallo, from the West African country of Guinea, by New York City 
police officers as he stood in the entrance of his Bronx apartment 
building. 
</P>
<P>
	In Conakry, the Guinean capital, hundreds of people gathered for  
the return of Diallo's body. The body was taken to a hospital 
morgue to prepare first for a funeral on Tuesday in the city's main 
mosque, and then a 270-mile journey on Wednesday to his home 
village of Hollande-Bouroy, in the country's mountainous interior. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too bad that our young have been sacrificed to the spirit  
of violence that runs rampant in the streets of New York,'' 
Interior Minister Zainoul Sanoussi told reporters just before the 
flight touched down. 
</P>
<P>
	At Conakry's Ignace Deen hospital morgue, the Rev. Al Sharpton,  
the New York City black activist who accompanied the family to 
Guinea, told cabinet ministers, ``We promise we will go home and 
fight for justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diallo, whose father is a prominent Guinean trader, was educated  
at private schools in Thailand and Singapore, but was in New York 
working as a street peddler -- hawking videotapes, socks and other 
items from a sidewalk table. 
</P>
<P>
	Four police officers searching for a rapist fired 41 bullets at  
the 22-year-old man as he stood in the vestibule of his New York 
apartment building, hitting him 19 times. The officers involved 
have been placed on administrative non-enforcement duties, but 
still carry their weapons and badges. 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney for the officers has said that police thought Diallo  
was armed.

<HEADLINE> Costner's 'Message' Tops Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Kevin Costner's Valentine to America,  
``Message in a Bottle,'' edged out Mel Gibson's violent revenge 
film ``Payback'' at the holiday weekend box office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Message in a Bottle'' opened with $19.1 million in ticket  
sales from Friday through Monday, knocking the Mel Gibson action 
piece into second place in its second week with $18.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Timed for Valentine's Day, ``Message'' stars Costner as a boat  
builder whose bottled notes to his dead wife win the heart of a new 
love, played by Robin Wright Penn. 
</P>
<P>
	``My Favorite Martian,'' based on the 1960s TV sitcom, debuted  
in third place with $11.1 million, while ``Blast from the Past'' 
opened at No. 5 with $9.7 million, according to Exhibitor Relations 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``Blast'' stars Brendan Fraser as a man who grows up in a bomb  
shelter and emerges into modern-day Los Angeles, where he meets 
Alicia Silverstone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Martian'' benefited from timing and nostalgia, said Chuck  
Viane, general sales manager for Buena Vista Pictures. ``There 
hadn't been a new family film since Christmas,'' he said. ``The 
market was open and ready for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare in Love,'' moving into wider release, benefited  
from strong word of mouth and the 13 Academy Award nominations it 
garnered last week. It was in sixth place with $9.5 million over 
four days after adding more than 1,000 screens. 
</P>
<P>
	The reissued ``Saving Private Ryan,'' which had 11 Oscar  
nominations took seventh place with $4 million for four days. 
</P>
<P>
	Teen films that were supreme a few weeks ago saw their audiences  
dip. ``She's All That'' tumbled from second to fourth place with 
$10.2 million while ``Varsity Blues'' plummeted from No. 4 to No. 
10 with $3.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Simply Irresistible,'' starring Sarah Michelle Gellar of  
television's ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' tanked after a 
disappointing opening. It fell from the top 10 list after just two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``A Civil Action,'' ``Stepmom'' and ``You've Got Mail'' also  
left the list. 
</P>
<P>
	Another limited release, the quirky comedy ``Rushmore,'' added  
several hundred theaters in its second week and came in at No. 8 
with $3.7 million. Buena Vista planned to expand the movie yet 
again this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patch Adams'' fell from third to ninth place with $3.6  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, it was a slower Presidents Day holiday for movies than  
last year, when ``Titanic'' was sinking box office records. The top 
12 films took in $97.7 million, down 14.8 percent from the previous 
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are estimated grosses at North American theaters for Friday  
through Monday. Final figures were expected today: 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Message in a Bottle,'' $19.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Payback,'' $18.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``My Favorite Martian,'' $11.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``She's All That,'' $10.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``Blast from the Past,'' $9.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``Shakespeare in Love,'' $9.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``Saving Private Ryan,'' $4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``Rushmore,'' $3.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``Patch Adams,'' $3.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``Varsity Blues,'' $3.4 million.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Reassesses Its Web Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  
looked on as Pentagon cyber-warriors clicked away at their laptops 
and showed how would-be terrorists could find his son's home 
address. 
</P>
<P>
	Army Gen. Henry Shelton then got a demonstration of how a  
skilled adversary might combine publicly available biographies and 
contractor information on military Web sites with a few well-placed 
phone calls to pin down the dates of highly classified nuclear 
exercises. 
</P>
<P>
	The classified briefing, held in Shelton's Pentagon office, was  
then given to other generals and admirals as well as senior 
civilians, generating a momentum that has led the military to order 
a massive scrub of its vast network of Internet sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre said military Web sites  
offered adversaries ``a potent instrument to obtain, correlate and 
evaluate an unprecedented volume of aggregated information'' that 
could, when combined with other sources of information, ``endanger 
Department of Defense personnel and their families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instituted Dec. 7, the policy change has touched off a debate as  
some critics argue the Pentagon went too far in restricting the 
information it makes public on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, defense and national security officials have become  
more willing to discuss, on condition of not being identified by 
name, the nature of the risk their detailed review of military Web 
sites revealed. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was information that was potentially tactically useful  
to an adversary, the kind of thing where if someone really wanted 
to do harm to your personnel, it could facilitate them in 
undertaking an attack,'' said one senior defense official working 
on Internet security issues. Another national security official 
called the briefings ``eye-openers'' that startled commanders. 
</P>
<P>
	The briefings stemmed from work done in 1997 and 1998 by  
Pentagon ``red teams,'' a term associated with a notional enemy 
force in war games. Team members tried to learn how much mischief 
they could do by skillfully scanning military Web sites, without 
any sophisticated hacking. They showed Shelton, himself a former 
special operations specialist, how his own biography posted on a 
military Web site combined with non-military databases could 
quickly lead a terrorist to the home address of one of his sons 
living in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The red teams found detailed maps and aerial photographs of  
military installations that would help anyone planning a strike or 
a terrorist action. These were the kinds of pictures, one senior 
official noted ruefully, that the United States spent billions to 
get during the Cold War through its spy satellite network. Now the 
United States was giving such imagery away for free on the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior officers were particularly concerned when one of the red  
teams was able to combine a variety of data and make highly 
accurate estimates about the timing of nuclear weapons drills, 
exercises and readiness checks, according to two senior national 
security officials familiar with the briefings. 
</P>
<P>
	Biographies of individual commanders of units likely to be  
involved in such operations combined with phone calls to those 
commanders' bases yielded information about temporary duty 
assignments in Nevada at installations involved in nuclear weapons 
handling. Military Web sites containing contractor information, 
particularly formal requests for bids to supply particular security 
equipment, helped further hone this detective work, according to 
the officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaning the military Web sites of potentially dangerous  
information has proved a monumental task. Bill Leonard, a top 
Pentagon information security official, said the military was 
unsure initially how many Web sites it had, and even today can only 
provide an estimate. For a time, the Army completely closed off 
access to its 1,000 Web sites. Now back on line, the Army's Web 
sites have been substantially trimmed, as have those of the other 
services. Entire Internet addresses have been put off limits, with 
the terse message on the computer screen that information 
previously available has been removed for security reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Some think the scrub of military Web sites has gone too far.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a wartime information policy,'' said John Pike of the  
Federation of American Scientists, a Washington-based research 
group that follows military and intelligence matters. ``All kinds 
of program information is being withdrawn. Almost anything that 
discloses what an agency actually does, beyond a brief mission 
statement, is going away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Federation is pursuing release of some of the deleted  
information under the Freedom of Information Act. In its filing 
with the Pentagon's security review office, the Federation said 
anything released as a result of the complaint should come in 
electronic form so the Federation can post the information on its 
Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	To date, the Pentagon cannot point to a specific incident where  
information posted on a military Web site resulted in harm to U.S. 
national security. 
</P>
<P>
	``The menacing scenarios have remained just that -- only  
scenarios,'' according to George Smith, editor of The Crypt 
Newsletter, an online publication dealing with computer security. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Pentagon says it has solid electronic evidence that  
foreign countries, including some adversaries, are regular visitors 
to U.S. military Web sites.

<HEADLINE> Rep. Kasich To Run for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Talking about tax cuts and Social  
Security, Republican Rep. John Kasich announced the formation a 
presidential exploratory committee Monday before beginning a swing 
through New Hampshire and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine-term congressman announced the formation of Kasich 2000  
at a $100-a-plate breakfast. The step allows him to raise and spend 
campaign money before officially declaring his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to begin to run America from the bottom up. From our  
families, from our communities to the top,'' he told a crowd of 
1,300. ``It's time to take the power back from the elite and put it 
back into the hands of the American people -- into our hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later Monday, he flew to New Hampshire where he told a gathering  
of 70 in Milford that he was a champion of ordinary people, who he 
says can change the world with everyday heroics. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich got his hair cut at Joe's Barber Shop in Milford, and  
asked people to invite him to dinner so he could hear their 
concerns. Barber Joe Swiezynski and a few others said they'd be 
glad to. 
</P>
<P>
	The 46-year-old chairman of the House Budget Committee called  
for improving Social Security and has been pushing for a 10 percent 
tax rate cut that opponents say would disproportionately benefit 
the wealthy. In his speech, Kasich portrays himself as the 
underdog. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has to do with the fact that I wasn't born the son of a  
millionaire, and I wasn't born the son of someone who is 
well-connected in society,'' Kasich said at an airport sendoff in 
Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich's swing through New Hampshire, which has the first  
primary, runs through Tuesday, then he is off to Iowa on Thursday 
and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Others mentioned as potential Republican candidates are former  
Vice President Dan Quayle, former Cabinet secretary Elizabeth Dole, 
Texas Gov. George W. Bush and publisher Steve Forbes.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Trust Unit Suspends Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Shares of a Hong Kong-based subsidiary of a  
troubled Chinese trust were suspended Monday following reports that 
its parent company's finance arm could face liquidation. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Law, company secretary for Gzitic Hualing Holdings Ltd.,  
said Guangzhou Finance has received a court petition for 
liquidation and the hearing will be held April 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Guangzhou Finance Co. Ltd. is the finance arm of Gzitic  
Hualing's parent, Guangzhou International Trust and Investment 
Corp., or Gzitic. 
</P>
<P>
	In China, however, a Gzitic executive on Monday denied reports  
that its Hong Kong arm was to be liquidated because of financial 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no problems,'' the executive told Dow Jones  
Newswires on condition of anonymity. No further details were given. 
</P>
<P>
	Guangzhou Finance didn't answer phone calls Monday. Many Hong  
Kong companies were closed Monday for the Lunar New Year, which 
begins Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Law declined to comment on how a liquidation of Guangzhou  
Finance would affect Gzitic Hualing, an investment holding company 
with subsidiaries in the manufacture and sale of household 
electrical appliances. Guangzhou Finance and Gzitic together hold a 
58 percent stake in Gzitic Hualing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Law said it remains unclear whether Guangzhou Finance will go  
out of business. But the accounting firm KPMG has been appointed by 
Hong Kong's High Court as provisional liquidators, meaning auditors 
from the firm will carry out the liquidation if the court orders 
it, KPMG spokeswoman Pat Lees said. 
</P>
<P>
	The troubles at Gzitic's subsidiaries are the most recent in a  
string of problems that have come to light since the closing of 
Guangdong International Trust and Investment Corp., or Gitic, the 
investment company of China's wealthiest province. 
</P>
<P>
	The government closed Gitic in October, finding the company had  
debts of $4.3 billion and assets of only $2.6 billion.

<P>
	WESTPORT, Conn. (AP) -- Actor Paul Newman made a rare stage  
appearance with his wife to benefit a land trust that is trying to 
save 668 acres of forest from development. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't been on stage since we were wearing furs and  
carrying clubs with spikes,'' Newman said Sunday. With him in a 
production of ``Love Letters'' was his wife of 41 years, Joanne 
Woodward. 
</P>
<P>
	The appearance at the Westport Country Playhouse raised $175,000  
for the Aspetuck Land Trust, which must raise $12 million by 
September to purchase the land. 
</P>
<P>
	Newman and Woodward live near the property. Woodward said their  
children used to fish in the nearby reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a community like this doesn't protect the few parcels of  
open space now, we'll be kicking ourselves 50 years from now,'' 
Newman said.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed generally lower  
Monday, but the key index in Tokyo rose in reaction to last week's 
government decision to use public funds to support Japan's weakened 
banking system. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 81.03  
points, or 0.58 percent, closing at 14,054.72. On Friday, the index 
rose 21.29 points, or 0.15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan announced on Friday a plan to inject 7.5  
trillion yen ($66 billion) in public funds into 15 major banks in 
an attempt to prevent Japan's banking system from collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks also got a boost after the central bank said late Friday  
it was cutting a key interest rate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan's policy board lowered its target for  
overnight call money -- the rate banks charge each other for 
unsecured short-term loans -- to an all-time low of 0.15 percent 
from 0.25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 114.08 yen in late  
afternoon trading, down 0.24 yen from its level Friday in Tokyo and 
also below its New York level of 114.21 yen on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in Hong Kong closed lower in a shortened session,  
with most investors sticking to the sidelines ahead of the Chinese 
New Year holiday. 
</P>

	The blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 23.03 points, or 0.2 percent,  
to 9,402.39. On Friday, the index had surged 278.62 points. The 
bourse closed at midday and will reopen Friday after a three-day 
new year break. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said investors remained cautious ahead of the holiday  
and in the wake of losses on Wall Street Friday and rising local 
interbank rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wall Street was down over 80 points last Friday, and interest  
rates appear to be firming in the U.S. That underlined the bearish 
sentiment,'' said Andrew To, a director at Tai Fook Securities Ltd.

	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower. The NZSE-40  
Capital Index fell 21.82 points, or 1 percent, to 2,147.18. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed lower in quiet trading as most  
investors stayed on the sidelines ahead of the Chinese Lunar New

light ahead of the two-day Chinese New Year holiday. The benchmark 
Straits Times Index rose 6.30 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,361.15. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed generally mixed, with the key  
index slipping on profit-taking following Friday's 11 percent surge 
that was triggered by the passage of a bill to set up a bankruptcy 
court by the country's senate. The SET index fell 2.47 points, or 
0.7 percent, to 344.96.

<HEADLINE> Kwan, Weiss Scan Their New Rivals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Michelle Kwan and Michael Weiss know it's  
only a matter of time before some upstart with an attitude is 
nipping at their skate blades, just itching to knock them off that 
medals podium. 
</P>
<P>
	Now they know the names of those future nightmares: Naomi Nari  
Nam and Trifun Zivanovic. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan put on yet another elegant and spectacular display -- is  
there any other kind for her? -- to easily win her third title 
Saturday at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was one of those performances where I just let it go,''  
said Kwan, 18, of Torrance, Calif. ``This year I got a little 
nervous heading into nationals -- I want to improve. I already know 
there are people out there to challenge me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss, free from five-time champion Todd Eldredge's shadow for  
the first time in two years, was nearly flawless to win his first 
crown. 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt good, it definitely does,'' he said, a slow smile  
crossing his face. ``It's an incredibly prestigious title to hold, 
and being close to it the last couple of years, it feels great to 
be the champion of the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the future was following close behind. For Kwan, it's the  
sprite-like Nari Nam, who at 13 displays the same beyond-her-years 
elegance and maturity that Kwan did a few years back. 
</P>
<P>
	Nari Nam is too young to go to the world championships next  
month, so Kwan will be joined by Angela Nikodinov and Sarah Hughes, 
who finished fourth. Though Hughes is also only 13, she's eligible 
because she won the silver medal at the world juniors. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's an enormous gap,'' coach John Nicks said of the  
difference between Kwan and Nari Nam. ``To start, there's a 
five-year gap. Secondly, Michelle is unassailable in the area of 
elegance and interpretive skating. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully in the next few years, Naomi will be able to  
challenge her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zivanovic, 23, of Los Angeles, jumped from seventh in 1997 -- he  
withdrew last year -- to second with the performance of his career. 
His program to ``West Side Story'' brought the crowd to its feet, 
and he responded by blowing kisses and pumping his arms. When coach 
Gary Visconti put a baseball hat on his head, Zivanovic quickly 
took it off and triumphantly waved it in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy Goebel, the only American to land a quadruple jump in  
competition, was third. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I got off the ice, I didn't care what place I got, it  
felt so good to skate that way,'' Zivanovic said. ``It's a dream 
come true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A dream that's been a long and hard time coming, too.  
Zivanovic's first love was hockey, but his mother used to bribe him 
with toys to figure skate. He wasn't always the easiest child to 
coach, Visconti recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Zivanovic was somewhat of a terror from the time he was  
7 to about 11. When he couldn't hit his jumps, he'd kick the ice or 
the walls. And he threatened to quit more times than Visconti can 
remember. 
</P>
<P>
	``He thought it was too hard. 'This is too difficult, I'm  
quitting.' He must have said that 100 times,'' Visconti said, 
laughing. ``It's been 15 years of discipline and a little coaching 
on the side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Visconti's patience paid off, and it's meant more to  
Zivanovic and his family than any medal from nationals. Zivanovic's 
mother, Glenda, has multiple sclerosis and is confined to a 
wheelchair. Her husband, Zoran, is a mechanic for Mercedes. 
</P>
<P>
	Between medical bills and training costs, the family hasn't had  
an easy time. But Zivanovic's success brings a joy to his mother 
that's better than any physical therapy or medication, Visconti 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He plays it down, but she's not doing well,'' Visconti said of  
Glenda Zivanovic, who watched her son's performance from the 
handicapped seats. ``They're a very close-knit family. The mom is 
very, very supportive, and this sport is keeping her living because 
she feels needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Zivanovic isn't done yet, Visconti said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Trifun's a late bloomer,'' said Visconti, a two-time U.S.  
champion and world bronze medalist. ``For a young man, he's 
maturing slowly, which is good. The reason I stick with him is 
because I see a tremendous amount of improvement yet to be done 
both athletically and artistically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Danielle and Steve Hartsell won their first pairs title, edging  
Kyoko Ina, who won two U.S. crowns with former partner Jason 
Dungjen but now skates with John Zimmerman. Laura Handy and J. Paul 
Binnebose were third. 
</P>
<P>
	Naomi Lang and Peter Tchernyshev won their first ice dancing  
title.

<HEADLINE> Students Find Scholarships Run Dry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- They were, without a doubt, the best and  
brightest high school seniors in the country: straight-A students, 
National Merit Scholars, class valedictorians. 
</P>
<P>
	The students, one from every state in the nation and the  
District of Columbia, each had won a $10,000-a-year college 
scholarship, renewable for four years, from Houston-based 
AdamsVision USA. 
</P>
<P>
	There was just one problem. AdamsVision now admits there is no  
money and never was. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the students are scrambling for financial assistance while  
their parents are searching for answers and, in some cases, 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was always so trusting. It never even entered my mind that  
something like this could happen,'' said scholarship recipient 
Amber March, who is studying at Eckerd College in Florida. ``I'd 
like to believe it was just an unfortunate mistake, but I kind of 
think I've been had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AdamsVision founder Val Adams insists he still is trying to  
scrape up money to honor the scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very saddened that we're at the point that we are, but at  
the same time I'm very hopeful that we will get these scholarships 
started and be able to continue our commitment,'' Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Boone, a prosecutor with the Harris County district  
attorney's office, doesn't think the students should hold their 
breath. ``Based on my contact with him, I would be concerned if he 
were in any business where anyone was relying on his promises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boone described Adams as a habitual criminal, convicted of theft  
for writing bogus checks on six different occasions. Adams remains 
on probation for a 1993 case. 
</P>
<P>
	``His schemes were fairly grandiose,'' Boone said. ``He had some  
sort of a fake business and he would use checks from the business 
basically just to live well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boone said Adams may have had legitimate enterprises but that  
``typically there would be no substance behind the business. It 
would just be a front.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adams acknowledges his criminal past but maintains the  
scholarship effort was on the level. He notes that the students 
were not asked to pay an application fee or provide any money, 
something the students and their parents confirm. 
</P>
<P>
	And he insists he invested $300,000 for expenses such as  
salaries for the professional educators who selected the 
recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams said he started his company in June 1997 and the  
scholarships were AdamsVision's primary focus. 
</P>
<P>
	In fall 1997, he sent applications for its ``Scholar-Leadership  
Award'' to every high school in the country. An attached letter 
promised the awards would be presented to the winners by the 
governor of their state. 
</P>
<P>
	Eligible students had to have at least a 3.0 grade-point average  
and a combined SAT score of 1160 or above, and submit an essay and 
three letters of recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean Lockhart, a former teacher Adams hired as a consultant on  
the project, assembled 15 educators in December 1997 to select the 
winners. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Adams assured her from the start that the scholarship  
money was in place. But Ms. Lockhart became suspicious after Adams, 
despite his contention, failed to pay her and the selection team. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 8, 1998, letters were sent to 51 students announcing  
they had won. But elation turned to confusion a few months later 
when AdamsVision sent another letter saying funding for the 
scholarships wasn't yet complete. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter stated AdamsVision was negotiating with ``two major  
corporations'' regarding sponsorship of the awards presentation and 
that although funding was incomplete, it remained ``absolutely 
confident we will receive corporate sponsorship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At that point, however, many students already had accepted early  
placement with universities. Additionally, some had lost out on 
other scholarships after winning one so large. 
</P>
<P>
	``You put one down for $10,000 for four years and you don't get  
anything else,'' said Larry Peters of Little Rock, Ark., whose 
daughter, Jessica, was passed over for another hefty scholarship 
after winning the AdamsVision award. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the final blow. Last month, Adams sent a two-paragraph  
letter to each university stating simply that AdamsVision ``will 
not be financially capable of honoring the Scholar-Leadership Award 
at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adams said he is still trying to get corporations like Sony,  
Ford and Time Warner to bankroll the scholarships. But he 
acknowledges AdamsVision has never received any money from any 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked why he went forward with choosing the scholarship  
recipients when he never had the money in hand, Adams responds: 
``Corporations won't give you money unless we have students. In 
other words, the corporation wants to see what they're buying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several corporations said that was simply false.  
</P>
<P>
	``We want to know after it's awarded, but it's not necessary for  
us to know the recipient prior to us giving the money,'' said 
Graham Painter, a spokesman for Houston-based Reliant Energy. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, 51 students have learned a painful lesson about  
trust. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very cheated and very angry,'' said Cassy Marshall of  
Rhinelander, Wis. ``I try not to let it affect me, but it's 
something I can't shake.''

<HEADLINE> Post-Impeach Normalcy Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress is taking a deep breath and then  
diving into what it hopes will be a period of post-impeachment 
normalcy. There's talk of bipartisanship but also real prospects 
for political strife and stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
	After a week off, lawmakers will finally get to concentrate on  
those issues they say they were elected to address -- Social 
Security and Medicare reform, education improvements and tax 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we are going to have some things to fight about,''  
White House Chief of Staff John Podesta said over the weekend, 
pointing to budget surpluses that Democrats want to use to extend 
the life of Medicare and Republicans want for tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	The top priority for the Republican majority will be approving  
by sometime in March a budget for fiscal year 2000. Last year, 
Republicans were forced to make major concessions to the 
administration after failing to come up with a budget resolution 
for fiscal year 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	With House Republicans reduced to a six-seat majority, new  
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has promised to work with 
Democrats, and says he and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, 
R-Miss., want to meet President Clinton to look for areas of 
agreement. ``If we are going to do anything at all and be 
productive then we have to work with the president,'' Hastert said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the first order of business, approving a budget, will be an  
exercise in dismantling Clinton's $1.77 trillion proposal by 
attacking his plan for saving Social Security and promoting GOP tax 
cut ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, the Senate GOP policy committee  
chairman, said there will be ``some bipartisan flavor'' to bills 
coming out of Congress, but with Clinton's impeachment trial over, 
``we ought to walk away from him and move with our agenda as if 
Bill Clinton never existed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House, which finished its role in the trial last year, has  
already gotten off to a fairly conventional start, holding Social 
Security and budget hearings and passing legislation intended to 
shield businesses from federal laws and regulations that companies 
say add to their costs of operating. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the end of the trial, the Senate will for the first  
time this year get a shot at voting on legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said that among the first items to come up will be a  
popular measure to boost military pay and two more complex issues -- 
building a missile defense system and giving local authorities 
greater control over the spending of education dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	He called the creation of a missile defense system ``crucial,''  
adding: ``The bad news is we do not have one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration and many Democrats support the basic concepts  
of the missile and education bills, but are certain to fight over 
the details. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., said he would try to amend the  
education bill to deny money to localities that promote children 
who don't meet basic standards and to seek more money for Clinton's 
plan for an additional 100,000 elementary school teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will renew the fight for things that make a difference in  
people's lives, starting with urging needed reforms in HMOs, aid 
for school construction repairs and an increase in the minimum 
wage,'' Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
	House members introduced a similar education bill last week and  
stood by their approach to decentralized authority. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will give the local schools the flexibility to spend  
federal education dollars as they see fit,'' said Rep. John 
Peterson, R-Pa. ``It's an approach that will enrage the liberals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the first bills to reach the House floor will be a  
measure to protect cellphone users from electronic eavesdropping. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other measures sure to raise serious political sparks  
are also headed for early spring consideration: 
</P>
<P>
	--Congress will try again to establish a temporary nuclear waste  
storage site in Nevada. Nevada's senators, backed by the 
administration, have successfully filibustered the bill the last 
few years. 
</P>
<P>
	--The business community is pushing legislation that would  
protect businesses from costly lawsuits resulting from computer 
problems in the year 2000. Trial lawyers say the bill would give 
businesses an excuse for not fixing the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	--New Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, R-Texas, has  
promised to give priority to legislation to break down regulatory 
barriers between financial institutions. The bill passed the House 
by only one vote last year; Gramm's opposition to provisions 
requiring banks to lend to the poor and minorities in their 
neighborhoods prevented Senate action. 
</P>
<P>
	--The administration supports legislation aimed at promoting  
trade with sub-Saharan Africa through lower tariffs, but some 
Democrats want to expand the bill to include debt relief for those 
areas.

<HEADLINE> Yanks, Jeter Go to Arbitration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Risking the chance they will alienate one of  
their top stars, the New York Yankees went to salary arbitration 
Monday with shortstop Derek Jeter. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter, who appeared in his first All-Star game last summer,  
asked a three-man panel for $5 million, which would match Ruben 
Sierra's 1992 salary with Texas as the second-highest ever awarded 
in arbitration. The only higher award was the $5.3 million pitcher 
Jack McDowell got from the Chicago White Sox in 1994 -- when he lost 
his case. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees, led by lawyer Frank Casey, asked that Jeter be paid  
$3.2 million, more than four times Jeter's $750,000 salary last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Arbitrators Nicholas Zumas, Ira Jaffe and Gil Vernon are  
expected to issue their decision Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	When Bernie Williams became a free agent last autumn, he said  
that anger from his 1996 arbitration hearing lingered. Williams, 
the last Yankee to go to a hearing before Jeter, nearly signed with 
Boston but instead stayed with New York, agreeing to an $87.5 
million, seven-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter, 24, is eligible for free agency after the 2001 season,  
one year after Seattle shortstop Alex Rodriguez becomes eligible, 
which could lead to a record deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter hit .324 last season with 19 homers, 84 RBIs and 30  
steals. He was fifth in the AL in batting average and first in runs 
with 127. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners won the first five hearings this year. Chicago White Sox  
second baseman Ray Durham, also scheduled for a hearing Monday, 
instead agreed to a $20 million, four-year contract.

<HEADLINE>  US Draws Denmark in Women's Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Even as the matches for the Women's  
World Cup this summer were being set, organizers were pleading with 
fans around the country to show their support for the biggest 
women-only sporting event in history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Come this summer and fill the stadiums and excite young girls  
all over the world,'' said Donna de Varona, chair of the organizing 
committee for the 32-match tournament that will run from June 
19-July 10 in seven U.S. cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States drew North Korea, Nigeria and Denmark in its  
group for first-round matches. The Americans have six wins and a 
tie in their 10 games against Denmark, while the U.S. squad has 
never played North Korea or Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could call this the unknown group, because we really don't  
know North Korea or Nigeria very well,'' U.S. coach Tony DiCicco 
said after Sunday night's draw. ``Denmark has been a strong, 
physical opponent for us in the past, and will be a good test for 
us in the opener.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tiffeny Milbrett, a forward on the U.S. team, said the Americans  
are more comfortable with Denmark than with the other nations in 
their group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Personally, I am a little scared of unknown teams,'' Milbrett  
said. ``Often those types of teams are scrappy teams. And scrappy 
teams' strengths tend to match up against our weaknesses pretty 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The draw resulted in confusion about which nation the Americans  
will play in their opening match, and got more confusing when 
officials switched around two groups for marketing reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	FIFA president Sepp Blatter announced during the draw ceremony,  
televised live throughout the United States, that the U.S. team 
will face North Korea in its opening match June 19 at Giants 
Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	But Women's World Cup officials later said the U.S. team will  
face Denmark in that opening match. The Americans will play Nigeria 
at Chicago's Soldier Field on June 24 and complete their 
first-round matches against North Korea at Foxboro Stadium outside 
Boston on June 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers also switched around two groups. China originally was  
announced as the top-seeded team in Group C and Norway, the 
defending champion, as the top-seeded team in Group D. But those 
group assignments later were switched, with Norway heading up Group 
C and China leading Group D. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the schedule released weeks ago, the top team in  
Group D is scheduled to play its first match in San Jose and the 
top team in Group C will play its first game at Foxboro. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers said they decided to switch the group assignments  
because they wanted China to play its opener in the San Francisco 
Bay area, which has a large Asian community. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decision was made for local marketing reasons by the  
Women's World Cup organizing committee based on the tremendous 
Chinese population in northern California and the interest we 
received from different Chinese organizations to bring the team to 
this venue,'' said Steve Vanderpool, vice president of 
communications for the Women's World Cup.

<HEADLINE>  US Draws Denmark in Women's Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Even as the matches for the Women's  
World Cup this summer were being set, organizers were pleading with 
fans around the country to show their support for the biggest 
women-only sporting event in history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Come this summer and fill the stadiums and excite young girls  
all over the world,'' said Donna de Varona, chair of the organizing 
committee for the 32-match tournament that will run from June 
19-July 10 in seven U.S. cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States drew North Korea, Nigeria and Denmark in its  
group for first-round matches. The Americans have six wins and a 
tie in their 10 games against Denmark, while the U.S. squad has 
never played North Korea or Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could call this the unknown group, because we really don't  
know North Korea or Nigeria very well,'' U.S. coach Tony DiCicco 
said after Sunday night's draw. ``Denmark has been a strong, 
physical opponent for us in the past, and will be a good test for 
us in the opener.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tiffeny Milbrett, a forward on the U.S. team, said the Americans  
are more comfortable with Denmark than with the other nations in 
their group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Personally, I am a little scared of unknown teams,'' Milbrett  
said. ``Often those types of teams are scrappy teams. And scrappy 
teams' strengths tend to match up against our weaknesses pretty 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The draw resulted in confusion about which nation the Americans  
will play in their opening match, and got more confusing when 
officials switched around two groups for marketing reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	FIFA president Sepp Blatter announced during the draw ceremony,  
televised live throughout the United States, that the U.S. team 
will face North Korea in its opening match June 19 at Giants 
Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	But Women's World Cup officials later said the U.S. team will  
face Denmark in that opening match. The Americans will play Nigeria 
at Chicago's Soldier Field on June 24 and complete their 
first-round matches against North Korea at Foxboro Stadium outside 
Boston on June 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers also switched around two groups. China originally was  
announced as the top-seeded team in Group C and Norway, the 
defending champion, as the top-seeded team in Group D. But those 
group assignments later were switched, with Norway heading up Group 
C and China leading Group D. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the schedule released weeks ago, the top team in  
Group D is scheduled to play its first match in San Jose and the 
top team in Group C will play its first game at Foxboro. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers said they decided to switch the group assignments  
because they wanted China to play its opener in the San Francisco 
Bay area, which has a large Asian community. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decision was made for local marketing reasons by the  
Women's World Cup organizing committee based on the tremendous 
Chinese population in northern California and the interest we 
received from different Chinese organizations to bring the team to 
this venue,'' said Steve Vanderpool, vice president of 
communications for the Women's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The draw was held at halftime of a match won 2-1 by a squad of

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Debates Nissan Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler co-chairman Juergen  
Schrempp said Monday that the car company will decide within three 
months on the possible acquisition of a stake in Japanese automaker 
Nissan Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nissan offers excellent opportunities,'' Schrempp told  
students during a speech at the University of Bayreuth in northern 
Bavaria. 
</P>
<P>
	A DaimlerChrysler spokesman confirmed Schrempp's remarks.  
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler said in December it had been looking for about a  
year into conditions for possible cooperation in commercial vehicle 
production with Nissan and its subsidiary Nissan Diesel. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month Schrempp and Nissan Motor president Yoshikazu Hanawa  
met in Tokyo, but and said that the companies were in talks on a 
possible alliance. Both declined to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan is struggling to survive under a debt load totaling an  
estimated $22.2 billion. The company has lost money in five of the 
past six years.

<HEADLINE> All-in-Wonder: Not All Wonderful? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	So the widget you're thinking of adding to your home computer  
got rave reviews, the company is well-established and your system 
meets the requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	That means you're safe, right?  
</P>
<P>
	With apologies to George Gershwin, ``It Ain't Necessarily So.''  
</P>
<P>
	I had eagerly awaited the arrival of an ATI All-in-Wonder Pro,  
an 8-megabyte PCI bus video card that incorporates a TV tuner and a 
graphics accelerator with 3-D capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The product of a Canadian company, it had gotten good reviews in  
the trade press. And it came with a setup CD and a manual that at 
first seemed to be a fine example of the art, with clear diagrams 
and instruction. Video cables and in-out adapters were included. 
And the TV tuner part was pretty special, with zoom and the ability 
to scan through all available stations for, as the box says, ``an 
at-a-glance look at what's on.'' Not bad for $169.99. 
</P>
<P>
	The TV capability was important to me because the set in my home  
office has gone off to college. So, following instructions, I 
opened the computer case, removed the existing video card, inserted 
the new one, fired up the system and started the installation 
process. It went swimmingly, until it came time to restart Windows 
98, which went obediently into restart mode and hung. ... and hung 
and hung and hung. 
</P>
<P>
	Then I noticed an insert to the manual labeled ``For Windows 98  
Users.'' It gave this advice: ``Windows 98 offers many exciting new 
features for users with an All-in-Wonder or All-in-Wonder Pro. The 
fastest way for you to access these features is to set up your 
All-in-Wonder with Windows 95. ... and then upgrade to Windows 98. 
Reformatting your hard drive is not necessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Say what? Go back to 95, install card, upgrade to 98? No way!  
</P>
<P>
	When even a new install of Windows 98 would identify the  
hardware and then hang on restart, out came the new card and in 
went the old card -- and my dog got a vocabulary lesson in case he 
learns to talk and encounters a situation for which ``Gosh!'' would 
be inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, a visit to ATI's Web site found this little gem buried  
within: 
</P>
<P>
	``When attempting to install the ATI DISPLAY DRIVERs for Windows  
98 the following error occurs. ... After this error occurs the 
system will hang during the Windows RE-START required by the driver 
installation. ATI is investigating reports of this issue. This 
error does not occur for most users.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It then goes on to suggest trying it without  
installation-monitoring software, and if that fails, asks for more 
information about your system than even its mother would know. 
</P>
<P>
	None of which is stated on the box, which chirps that the card  
is ``designed to make installation easy so you are up and running 
in minutes.'' True -- but just how many minutes? 
</P>
<P>
	More on this subject in the future, after I've wrestled the card  
into submission. But that's something the consumer shouldn't have 
to do. And something he should know about before buying. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Samsung Still Committed to Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Despite the Salt Lake City's Olympic  
corruption scandal, Samsung Electronics Co. said Monday it won't 
abandon its $45 million sponsorship of the 2000 Sydney Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are worried the commercial values of the Olympics have  
suffered because of these scandals,'' spokeswoman Cho Sung-in said. 
``But we remain committed to our sponsorship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cho spoke in reaction to an Australian newspaper report that  
Samsung's sponsorship was in doubt because of vote-buying scandals 
and other allegations of misconduct involving members of the 
International Olympic Committee. Cho said The Sydney Morning Herald 
report Monday was ``far too exaggerating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kim Se-hun, Samsung Electronics' sports marketing senior  
manager, was quoted as saying, ``We believe the recent scandals 
present some danger to sponsorship. We still need to evaluate the 
reports of the various judiciary committees before making decisions 
or definite comments as to the next step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cho said that while Samsung was ``carefully watching the  
investigation,'' the company ``never said we will withdraw our 
sponsorship. We are investing for the Sydney Olympics as 
scheduled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sydney 2000 organizing president Michael Knight also discounted  
the newspaper report. 
</P>
<P>
	``Samsung are absolutely committed to the Sydney 2000  
Olympics,'' Knight said. ``Indeed, I'm having dinner tonight with 
some of the Samsung people who have paid $5,200 as a donation to 
the Australian Olympic team fundraiser to have dinner with myself 
and some of the athletes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A major Olympic partner, John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co ,  
criticized the IOC last week and said it will not use the Olympic 
rings as part of marketing programs until corruption is purged. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight said Monday he thought no sponsors would pull out of  
Olympic deals and said additional agreements will be announced 
within the next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Sydney organizers are seeking about $130 million to reach their  
sponsorship target for the 2000 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Samsung became a worldwide partner of the Olympics in 1997 and  
its chairman, Lee Kun-hee, has been an IOC member since 1996.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Nixon Adviser Ehrlichman Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- John D. Ehrlichman, President Nixon's domestic  
affairs adviser who was imprisoned for 18 months for the Watergate 
conspiracy, has died. He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
	Ehrlichman died Sunday of natural causes at his home in Atlanta.  
He had suffered from diabetes, his son, Tom, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ehrlichman, who along with H.R. Haldeman was one of Nixon's two  
top advisers, resigned from his White House post in April 1973 and 
was convicted two years later for obstruction of justice, 
conspiracy and perjury in the attempted cover-up of the burglary of 
the Democratic National Committee offices at the Watergate complex 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Early on June 17, 1972, burglars tied to Nixon's re-election  
campaign broke into the Democratic offices. They were trying to 
replace a faulty telephone bugging device installed during an 
earlier break-in. They got caught by a security guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Nixon, who won re-election that November, and his aides tried to  
cover up the growing scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	As the cover-up began to unravel and pressure mounted, Nixon  
summoned Haldeman and domestic counsel John Ehrlichman to the 
presidential cabin at Camp David, Md., in April 1973 and told them 
they would have to resign. The next day, he fired White House 
counsel John Dean, and accepted the resignations of Haldeman, 
Ehrlichman and Attorney General Richard Kleindienst. 
</P>
<P>
	Under threat of impeachment, Nixon resigned on Aug. 9, 1974. He  
was later pardoned by President Ford. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Volvo May Buy Navistar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Swedish vehicle maker Volvo AB says it is talking  
to U.S. truck manufacturer Navistar International Corp. about a 
possible takeover, the Financial Times reported in Monday's 
editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior executives from Volvo, which agreed last month to sell  
its automobile division to Ford Motor Co., have met with officials 
from Chicago-based Navistar to discuss a buyout offer, the 
newspaper said, quoting an unnamed source close to the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	The report speculated that the deal could be worth at least $3  
billion, but added that the price could be substantially lower if 
Volvo acquired only Navistar's heavy truck operations. The 
discussions may also only lead to some kind of alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	A takeover would more than double Volvo's share of the North  
American truck market, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Navistar International, the United States' third-largest heavy  
truck manufacturer, also makes medium-sized trucks and school 
buses, and builds diesel engines. It exports trucks and parts to 
more than 80 dealers in 75 countries and sells its merchandise 
through about 1,000 dealers in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	Navistar's market value is about $2.3 billion, based on Friday's  
closing stock price of $35.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy Wiley, a spokesman at Navistar's Chicago headquarters,  
declined to comment on the report. ``It's our policy not to comment 
on speculation or rumor,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides its well-known car division, Volvo also makes trucks,  
buses, construction equipment and marine and aviation engines. The 
proposed sale of Volvo's car division to Ford for $6.45 billion is 
aimed at giving Volvo the resources to concentrate on developing 
its other divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo last month surprised markets by acquiring 13 percent of  
the stock in rival Swedish truck-maker Scania and is making an 
effort to buy the company. If successful, Volvo would be Europe's 
largest truck manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
	``By our move with Scania we have clearly showed that we are  
willing to participate in the restructuring of the (truck) business 
but we won't comment on a specific report like this,'' said Mats 
Edenborg, a spokesman for Volvo.

<HEADLINE>  Mike Utley Takes a Few Giant Steps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- For the first time since he lay paralyzed on the  
Pontiac Silverdome turf seven years ago, Mike Utley stood in public 
Monday and took a few wobbly steps. 
</P>
<P>
	``By standing up, you feel who you are,'' he said. ``I was 315  
pounds and 6-foot-6. I was proud to be as big as I was. I was proud 
to be as tall as I am. I want it back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Towering over everyone as he did so long ago, wearing a Detroit  
Lions T-shirt, the former offensive lineman made it a few feet down 
a wooden walkway, painfully swinging one leg ahead, then the other. 
</P>
<P>
	He wore lower leg braces to keep his ankles from rolling. A  
friend steadied him on each side. He grimaced as he took each 
excruciating step, his girlfriend Dani Andersen helping him by 
making sure his spindly lower legs stayed straight. 
</P>
<P>
	A couple of times, his legs gave way, and the two buddies on  
each side, retired NFL center Bill Lewis and Lions linebacker Rob 
Frederickson, had to catch him. 
</P>
<P>
	But he made it 10 feet or so.  
</P>
<P>
	``Whew! I'd rather go through double days than that,'' he said  
afterward. ``No, it's exhilarating. Seven years is a long time to 
be sitting in this chair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His sense of humor, a major ally throughout his struggle, was on  
display, too. 
</P>
<P>
	As Utley stood poised for this high drama, a cell phone rang.  
</P>
<P>
	``Dominos,'' he said, imitating the guy who answers at the pizza  
place. 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone laughed.  
</P>
<P>
	Then it was back to business, as it has been every tough day  
since that horrifying moment on Nov. 17, 1991, in the Lions' home 
game against the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	He knew immediately the injury was serious. Two of his vertebrae  
had been crushed. As he was carried off the field, he gave the 
crowd a ``thumbs up'' gesture. 
</P>
<P>
	It's become his trademark, and Utley has come to symbolize grit,  
determination and optimism in the face of grim odds. He vows to 
someday walk off the field from the spot he was injured. He talked 
Monday of someday walking his mom three blocks from her home to 
church. 
</P>
<P>
	He's a long way from that, but those steps in front of a crowd  
of reporters and photographers in a Phoenix hotel conference room 
were an emotional triumph nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was awesome to see him up there,'' Lewis said. ``Yesterday  
when we rehearsed, I was practically in tears. It's nothing short 
of miraculous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Utley, 33, is paralyzed from the chest and elbows down. His  
upper arms still are the bulging biceps of a football lineman. But 
he has only partial control of his hands and lower arms. About two 
years ago, he began to feel some sensations in his legs. He can 
feel his toes, describing it as the way you'd feel on an extremely 
cold day. 
</P>
<P>
	He began working with biofeedback, trying to identify the  
connection between his brain and those few alive nerves in his 
legs. He kept up daily, grueling physical therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rehabilitation is a lifestyle,'' he said. ``It's not something  
you just do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A major reason for his public display, and the pressure that  
came with it, on Monday was his desire to raise more money for his 
Mike Utley Foundation, dedicated research aimed at finding a cure 
for spinal cord injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Utley was quick to point out that no two spinal cord injuries  
are the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing you can control is your mind,'' he said. ``I'm  
not saying everyone will get as far as I've gotten. But they can do 
something today they didn't do yesterday. Maybe they can go 
outside. Maybe they can wheel themselves around the block, and 
maybe tomorrow they can do two blocks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Utley credits his positive attitude for everything he has  
accomplished, whether it be snow skiing, scuba diving, driving his 
specially equipped van or taking those few steps. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good start,'' he said of his effort Monday. ``Is it the  
finish line? Not even close? Will I continue on? Will I walk again? 
You betcha. ... I've taken a few more steps before, but I've never 
gone this far. I want to walk off that Silverdome, and one day I 
will. It might not be tomorrow, but someday I will. I guarantee 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors, who once told him he'd never walk again, now look on  
Utley as a great asset. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives their new patients hope,'' Utley said. ``If you take  
hope away, if you take dreams away, you lose them forever. But it 
goes back to the person. If you're a champion before you got hurt, 
you're a champion now. But you have to work at it. You have to have 
goals. I will never be number two, not today, not tomorrow, not 
ever. Why? Because I believe in myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He talked of going to hospitals to visit children stricken by  
paralyzing injuries, seeing their family's in pain and solidifying 
his determination to find a cure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to see moms and dads cry anymore,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Before he rose for that moment on his feet, he explained why he  
had decided to take these steps publicly. He wanted to show 
doctors, insurance companies and the health industry in general 
that rehabilitation is a lifelong process, something a seriously 
injured person needs to do until he dies. 
</P>
<P>
	And there was a more personal reason.  
</P>
<P>
	``I want to do it for my family and the people who have given me  
support from the first day when I came off that field and gave that 
thumbs up,'' he said, ``everyone in the Detroit organization, the 
friends I've made since I've been hurt. I will show them that I 
have never quit. I will never quit until I am completely free of 
this spinal cord injury.''

<HEADLINE> How the Media Survived Impeachment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Kathleen Hall Jamieson was shocked to open her  
newspaper the other day and find something other than Monica 
Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Shocked, but pleased.  
</P>
<P>
	``What would it take to displace the non-news of  
Clinton-Lewinsky from the front page? The answer was King 
Hussein,'' said Ms. Jamieson, dean of the University of 
Pennsylvania's Annenberg School of Communication. 
</P>
<P>
	To Ms. Jamieson's mind, too much has been written and broadcast  
over the past year about oral sex in the Oval Office, crowding out 
other stories that should have drawn attention -- the surplus and 
Social Security, education and patients' rights. 
</P>
<P>
	She's not alone. From the beginning, the news media have been  
pilloried for Clinton-Lewinsky overkill. They have been criticized 
for inaccuracies, and for reliance on unidentified, manipulative 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, more than a year and untold amounts of ink later, the  
unending story has reached an end -- at least for the moment. 
</P>
<P>
	And the question remains: How did the press do?  
</P>
<P>
	The answer, according to critics: OK -- with some exceptions. And  
it wasn't a pretty thing to watch, regardless. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the mainstream press ... did under the circumstances a  
superior job, and they were also self-correcting,'' said Gene 
Roberts, a former top editor at The New York Times and Philadelphia 
Inquirer and now a professor at the University of Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	``When someone made a mistake, there were so many people working  
on the story that immediately, it was pointed out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two largest mistakes were made early on, when The Dallas  
Morning News and The Wall Street Journal retracted reports on their 
Web pages that third parties had seen President Clinton and Miss 
Lewinsky alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two instances across a year are not that bad,'' Ms. Jamieson  
noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Some organizations were especially careful. Tom Rosenstiel,  
media critic and director of the Project for Excellence in 
Journalism, said the Los Angeles Times had the story of Ms. 
Lewinsky's stained blue dress, but, ``They decided that it did not 
meet their standards'' for corroboration. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC went with the story, based on a single source, Rosenstiel  
said -- and it was true. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenstiel said there was a ``seller's market'' for information  
-- a market in which the media were open to manipulation by 
anonymous sources. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a cascade of single-source stories in the frenzy at  
the story's start, and then in those periods when little was 
happening, and much of the media felt the need to report something 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``The low point of the story was the trough between late  
February and the end of July-August, when the walls started 
tumbling around Clinton's denials,'' said James Poniewozik, media 
columnist for Salon, the Web magazine. ``There was a numbing cycle 
of opinion and speculation and conjecture going on for five or six 
months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the leaks turned out to be true, but the news came out  
in dribs and drabs, and it left the public confused. 
</P>
<P>
	``People got sick of the story. They wanted it to go away,  
because they couldn't evaluate whether it was true or not,'' said 
Robert Lichter, president of the Center for Media and Public 
Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The perception, Lichter said, was that these unending  
disclosures were unfair to Clinton, so sympathy drifted his way. 
When Clinton's presidency was imperiled, public opinion stayed 
firmly on his side. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a cadre of commentators took up residence on cable  
news channels, adding ``heat and no light'' to the story, Roberts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wonder what these people are going to do when the story is  
over,'' he said. ``I never saw them before this, and I don't 
particularly want to see them again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From the start, the media's focus on the story flew in the face  
of the public's distaste for it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Normally, the press does a pretty good job of having their ear  
to the ground and hearing it the way people are saying it. This is 
a case where the national press haven't been hearing what the folks 
are saying,'' said Roderick P. Hart, a professor of communication 
and government at the University of Texas at Austin. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rosenstiel said, ``Our instincts told us that this was an  
important story. But the public told us early on that they didn't 
think so. ... We hoped our instincts would be vindicated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually it happened, but ``it still antagonized a lot of  
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts said that he came ``from a time when newspapers didn't  
get into sex, or did only if somebody jumped into the reflecting 
pool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he can't imagine the media laying off a story like this  
one: ``I think if people are talking about impeaching the 
president, it seems to me you have some obligation to cover it.''

<HEADLINE> American Seeks Return to Normal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- With a growing number of American Airlines pilots  
reporting for duty, airline officials think they can resume regular 
service as early as Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	About 800 of American's 9,400 pilots were still listed as sick  
today, compared with the nearly 2,500 who declared themselves unfit 
to fly Thursday and Friday, American officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, about 250 -- or roughly 11 percent -- of the 2,250  
flights scheduled for today have been canceled because some pilots 
weren't immediately available for flying. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fort Worth-based airline has canceled only 17 flights  
scheduled for Tuesday, spokesman John Hotard said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to American, pilots have been taking themselves off  
the sick list at a rapid rate since a federal judge held the Allied 
Pilots Association and two top board members in contempt and 
promised sizable fines against them. 
</P>
<P>
	All but 12 or 13 pilots, who face possible disciplinary action,  
would be immediately cleared to fly after removing themselves from 
the list, Hotard said. He didn't have details on what the 12 or 13 
were accused of doing. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall threatened a large fine against  
the pilots' union Saturday, saying that the union did not do enough 
to encourage pilots to return to work after he ordered the union to 
end the sickout. That order had been issued Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half a million travelers have been left at the gate by  
the nation's second-largest airline because of the large number of 
pilots calling in sick. American has canceled 6,000 flights since 
the work action began Feb. 6, costing American between $67 million 
and $90 million, according to Chris Chiames, a spokesman for AMR 
Corp., parent company of American Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute centers on how quickly American should integrate the  
pilots from recently purchased Reno Air into its own roster. 
Negotiations on that issue are scheduled to restart this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the continued cancellations, most of the nation's  
airports were calmer Sunday with many passengers prepared for 
delays. 
</P>
<P>
	At Miami International Airport, heart-shaped decorations adorned  
American's baggage counter wall Sunday and musicians strolled 
through the terminal serenading passengers. But many travelers 
remained angry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I lost two to three years of age off my life,'' said  
Luis Delgado, a furniture exporter who faced delays in three cities 
over four days while trying to get home to the Dominican Republic. 
``This is not my problem, it's American Airlines'. We don't have to 
be the ones that suffer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The slowdown had the potential to severely hamper operations of  
cruise ships sailing in and out of Miami, but major cruise lines 
kept damage to a minimum by chartering their own flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall said he would decide Wednesday how much to levy in fines  
although he promised they would be substantial. He required the 
union to place $10 million with the court and for union president 
Rich LaVoy and vice president Brian Mayhew to remit a total of 
$15,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we are disappointed and disagree with Judge Kendall's  
order of contempt, we urge all pilots to comply with the 
restraining order,'' LaVoy said. ``We're taking his order

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Bolstered Internet News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It was the first Net blockbuster: The Intern and  
the President. For the first time, the new medium became a truly 
mainstream form of journalism. 
</P>
<P>
	And following the Senate's acquittal of President Clinton on  
impeachment articles, the same question that confronts mainstream 
media now confronts the Web: Where do we go from here? 
</P>
<P>
	``The offline and online components converged last year,'' said  
David Weir, managing editor of the online news magazine Salon. 
``This story continues to cycle back and forth, both online and 
offline, and that kind of relationship is really, really 
revolutionizing our business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The public scandal started online on Jan. 17, 1998, when Matt  
Drudge told the Net community that Newsweek magazine was sitting on 
a bomb about to explode in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	He appeared on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' made the first mention  
of the infamous Gap dress and even got his own television program. 
</P>
<P>
	He had his stumbles, including a discredited report that Clinton  
fathered a child with a prostitute while governor of Arkansas. But 
the giants stumbled, too. The Wall Street Journal and the Dallas 
Morning News yanked early stories from their Web sites when they 
proved inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
	The major broadcast and print outlets also reported that Clinton  
stormed out of the room in fury during his taped deposition. That 
was wrong, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of the mainstream media made the same mistakes -- or  
worse -- than stuff you could find online,'' said John Pavlik, the 
executive director of the Center for New Media at Columbia 
University's Graduate School of Journalism. ``The online sources in 
some cases did a better job than the traditional media.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And whatever the source, people wanted to talk about it. The Web  
became a digital water cooler. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the Internet almost came to a halt when millions of  
people tried to download Special Independent Counsel Kenneth 
Starr's report on the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were so many times when the news seemed incredible, the  
public wanted to absorb that,'' said Colby Devitt, supervisor for 
discussion forums at The New York Times' Web site. The forums and 
the Web ``contributed to the feeling that they were part of the 
nation and a public community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, the Times sponsored more than 20 forums on Clinton and  
Lewinsky, and received more than 350,000 posts. And that's just on 
one site on the Web, which had Clinton scandal sites springing up 
like popcorn in a microwave. 
</P>
<P>
	A quick search on Altavista, a popular search engine, turned up  
almost 208,000 sites that mention Clinton and Lewinsky, and more 
than 136,000 mention Clinton and impeachment. But now, with the 
story over, what comes next? 
</P>
<P>
	A site run by Robert Sherman, www.impeachment.net in Los  
Angeles, already has plans. ``If it really does dry up, we'll just 
fold our tent,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others will press on.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet is a godsend,'' said Eugene Delgaudio, president  
of the Council of Volunteer Americans. ``It was literally sent by 
God to give the mimeograph crowd a way to communicate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His organization sponsors the Committee to Impeach the  
President, and runs the Web site, www.impeachclinton.org, where the 
topics are often the deaths of Vince Foster and Ron Brown, alleged 
illegal fundraising and the transfer of technology to China. He has 
come up with a new name for his group: The Committee to Impeach the 
President Again.

<HEADLINE> Indians More Likely To Be Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A first-ever comprehensive look by the Justice  
Department at crime among American Indians found that native 
peoples are more than twice as likely to become victims of violent 
crime as the nation's overall population. 
</P>
<P>
	And the study, released Sunday by the Bureau of Justice  
Statistics, also found that 4 percent of Indian adults, or 63,000, 
were in custody or otherwise involved in the criminal justice 
system on a typical day. That was twice the average of the white 
population, although less than the 10 percent among blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Indians suffer 124 violent crimes -- murders, assaults, robberies  
and rapes -- for every 100,000 population. That's double the violent 
crime rate for blacks and 2 1/2 half times the national average of 50. 
</P>
<P>
	``People need to know how desperate it is,'' said Kathleen  
Bliss, a federal prosecutor in New Mexico. ``Violent crime in 
Indian country is increasing while it goes down nationally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The murder rate among Indians is no higher than for whites, and  
only one-fifth as high as among blacks. But Indians are twice as 
likely as blacks and three times more likely than whites to be 
victims of rape or aggravated assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Family violence overall is no bigger problem among Indians than  
it is in the rest of the population, but Indian children are more 
likely to be abused than those of any other ethnic group, the study 
found. Reports of child abuse and neglect among Indians jumped 18 
percent between 1992 and 1995 as the national rate was falling by 8 
percent. The study offered no explanation for the increase, but law 
enforcement officials said it could be due to better reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, based on surveys and crime records, couldn't  
distinguish between Indians who live in cities and those on 
reservations, nor did it track year-to-year trends in the crime 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the nation's 2.3 million Indians live on reservations,  
and many of the rest are concentrated in such urban areas as 
Denver, Minneapolis and Phoenix. Law enforcement officials believe 
that crime among Indians has risen in recent years, driven partly 
by a proliferation of youth gangs. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, a study by federal law enforcement officials and tribal  
leaders declared a ``public safety crisis'' on the nation's 
reservations and proposed to double the size of their police 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Clinton administration's request, Congress increased  
spending on Indian law enforcement by more than 80 percent, or $108 
million, to pay for new jails, patrol cars and up to 1,000 
additional officers. The administration has asked for an additional 
$145 million increase next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 study said there were 1,600 BIA and tribal police  
officers patrolling 56 million acres of Indian land. That is 
equivalent to 1.3 officers for every 1,000 residents, compared with 
2.9 officers per 1,000 residents in non-Indian rural communities.

<HEADLINE> Around Alone Sailor Capsizes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) - Around Alone yachtswoman Isabelle  
Autissier has capsized and taken to a life raft in the Southern 
Pacific Ocean, race organizer Dan McConnell said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Autissier, overall leader in the single-handed round-the-world  
race, had sent out a mayday call and advised her French 
headquarters, McConnell said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Italian entrant Giovanni Soldini has been diverted to  
help Autissier and was 160 miles away from her. Autissier had been 
capsized in windy 30-foot seas halfway between New Zealand and Cape 
Horn, the southern tip of South America. She was about 2,500 miles 
from both points. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no land that is reasonably reachable so the other  
boats are the only option,'' McConnell said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Autissier had ``experienced this before'' when she was  
rescued by the Australian Navy during a solo race in 1994-95. 
</P>
<P>
	``She stays calm in these conditions, so we're thinking the  
best,'' McConnell said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Nixon Adviser Ehrlichman Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- John D. Ehrlichman, President Nixon's domestic  
affairs adviser who was disgraced and imprisoned for his role in 
the Watergate cover-up that ultimately led to Nixon's resignation, 
has died. He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
	Ehrlichman died Sunday of natural causes at his home in Atlanta.  
He had suffered from diabetes, his son, Tom, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ehrlichman and Nixon's chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman, were  
virtually indistinguishable by the public. Both were close to Nixon 
and they became known as the ``Berlin Wall'' because they 
constituted a kind of palace guard that shielded the reclusive 
Nixon from unwelcome encounters. 
</P>
<P>
	Ehrlichman coined a phrase that became part of the nation's  
political lexicon when he advised Nixon to allow L. Patrick Gray 
3rd, then acting director of the FBI, to become the fall guy for 
Watergate and to leave him ``twisting slowly, slowly in the wind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In April 1973, as the cover-up began to unravel and pressure  
mounted, Nixon held a tearful meeting at his presidential retreat 
at Camp David, Md., with his two intimate and powerful advisers -- 
the iron-willed Haldeman and the self-controlled Ehrlichman. By 
that time, Nixon's counsel, John W. Dean 3rd, had implicated them 
in the Watergate cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, Nixon fired Dean, and accepted the resignations of  
Haldeman, Ehrlichman and Attorney General Richard Kleindienst. 
Nixon hoped that the sacrifices of his closest aides would staunch 
the scandal and spare him. 
</P>
<P>
	The cover-up was the attempt to conceal from the public the  
White House's involvement almost from the start in the break-in at 
Democratic Party headquarters at the Watergate office complex in 
Washington on June 17, 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	The burglars, quickly tied to Nixon's re-election campaign, were  
trying to replace a faulty telephone bugging device installed 
during an earlier break-in. They got caught when a security guard 
noticed they had taped a door to keep it from locking. He removed 
the tape, the burglars replaced it and the guard called the police. 
</P>
<P>
	Nixon won re-election that November but when he was forced by  
the Supreme Court to surrender the tape that showed his own early 
involvement in the cover-up, his impeachment became inevitable and 
a few days later, on Aug. 9, 1974, he became the first and only 
president to resign. His successor, Gerald Ford, pardoned him. 
</P>
<P>
	Ehrlichman went to prison in October 1976 and served 18 months  
of a four to eight year term for obstruction of justice, conspiracy 
and perjury. He quit politics, moved to Santa Fe, N.M., wrote 
``inside'' political novels, and became a radio commentator. 
</P>
<P>
	His conviction grew out of his false testimony to a Senate  
committee and of a break-in in the Beverly Hills office of Dr. 
Lewis Fielding, a psychiatrist who had treated Daniel Ellsberg, the 
former Pentagon aide who leaked the Pentagon Papers to The New York 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Haldeman and John D. Mitchell, who had been Nixon's law partner  
and attorney general, also were among those imprisoned for their 
Watergate role. 
</P>
<P>
	``His role in Watergate should always be viewed against the  
historical backdrop of the culture war over Vietnam that was raging 
during the Nixon years,'' John H. Tayler, executive director of the 
Richard Nixon Library &AMP; Birthplace Foundation, said in a statement. 
``President Nixon wrote as follows in his memoirs: `I still believe 
that it is a tragedy of circumstances that ... John Ehrlichman went 
to jail and Daniel Ellsberg went free.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Ehrlichman never seemed able to escape the ghosts of Watergate  
and its effect on the public's impression of him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was never the person everybody saw in the Watergate  
hearings. But I have realized that I was never going to catch up 
with my image. It was set in concrete. It bothered me enormously 
for a while, what people thought of me,'' he told the Washington 
Post in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made myself stop caring because I knew I couldn't do a thing  
about it, and I knew it was going to tear me up if I tried.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview in 1982 to promote his memoir -- ``Witness to  
Power'' -- Ehrlichman minimized his own role in the scandal and said 
Nixon's character kept him from telling the truth about Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a question of weakness,'' Ehrlichman said. ``He simply  
could not bring himself to do something which I think he saw as 
delivering himself to his enemies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ehrlichman was born March 20, 1925, in Tacoma, Wash. He  
graduated from University of California, Los Angeles and got a law 
degree at Stanford University in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
	During World War II, he was a lead navigator in the 8th Air  
Force where he earned the Air Medal clusters and the Distinguished 
Flying Cross. Before joining the White House, Ehrlichman was a 
partner in the Seattle law firm of Hullin, Ehrlichman, Roberts &AMP; 
Hodge from 1952 to 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	Ehrlichman wrote four novels: ``The Company'' 1976; ``The Whole  
Truth'' 1979; ``The China Card'' 1986; (co-author) of ``The Rigby 
File'' 1989. He also wrote a memoir which was published in 1983, 
``Witness to Power: The Nixon Years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He eventually moved to Atlanta, where he served as senior vice  
president of Law Environmental. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife, Karen Hilliard, four sons and two  
daughters and his mother, Lillian. Funeral services will be 
private.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Musicians To Work With Cubans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Dozens of Americans will travel to Cuba next  
month on a once-forbidden mission: to create music. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 35 jazz, rock and country artists, ranging from Jimmy  
Buffett to Joan Osborne and the Indigo Girls, will work for a week 
to compose new songs in collaboration with Cuban artists. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. performers have toured Cuba before, but under the  
40-year-old U.S. trade embargo they could not collaborate on new 
works, said attorney Bill Martinez, who sought U.S. permission for 
the cultural exchange. The license was granted last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the sticking points was that, under the embargo ... you  
could not create new works, new material here,'' he said in a 
telephone interview Monday from Havana. ``This is historic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The project, dubbed ``Music Bridges ... Over Troubled Waters,''  
will culminate with a free concert on March 28, planned for 
Havana's 5,000-seat Karl Marx theater. 
</P>
<P>
	The event follows a thaw between the two countries in recent  
years and the Clinton administration's January decision to ease 
some cultural exchange restrictions of the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
	The event is the latest cultural effort by Alan Roy Scott, a San  
Fernando Valley songwriter and music producer whose nonprofit Music 
Bridges has masterminded similar projects in the former Soviet 
Union, Indonesia, Romania and Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott also was in Havana Monday, busily arranging the details  
and trying to avoid the inevitable politics surrounding relations 
with the communist island nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no goal other than the fact that we're here, we do  
this, and the world can judge for itself what it means,'' he said. 
``I only know when songs get written by people that are on the same 
wavelength, it transcends all those subjects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Music Bridges is working with the Cuban Music Institute to  
organize the event. Among the Cuban artists scheduled to take part 
are Chucho Valdes, a jazz pianist who heads the group Irakere and 
members of the popular groups Los Van, Maraca and Sierra Maestra. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez said he had to assuage concerns from both governments.  
U.S. officials wanted to make sure that the project wouldn't 
violate the embargo by giving the Cuban government a financial 
benefit, such as payments to the artists, while ``the Cubans had to 
know that this is a legitimate exchange where they weren't going to 
be exploited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	None of the American or Cuban performers will be paid, Martinez  
said.

<HEADLINE> Elizabeth Dole Has Education Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole, who's considering a bid for  
president, courted the nation's college and university leaders 
Monday and laid out an education platform centered on teacher 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole also championed school choice and accountability,  
ideas popular with fellow Republicans. And she stressed to the 
educators that she was one of them and wasn't there to bash them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've refused to join those who often find it expedient to turn  
teachers into rhetorical punching bags,'' said Mrs. Dole, who 
described her own stint teaching 11th grade history in suburban 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, we should expect the best out of our teachers. Yes, we  
should reward outstanding performances. ... But let us never forget 
that the true heroes of our society are not to be found on a movie 
screen or a football field. They are to be found in our 
classrooms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole, 62, also promised the American Council on Education  
she would champion higher learning. The council is a nonprofit 
lobbying group for all accredited college and universities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know where the future will take me,'' she told more  
than 1,000 educators, ``but I do know that if you are recruiting 
soldiers in the battle to strengthen federal investment in 
research, I'm ready to enlist right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole -- who has held cabinet posts in the Bush and Reagan  
administrations -- has left little doubt where she might be heading. 
Last week in New Hampshire, one of the early primary states, the 
potential candidate for the Republican nomination said America 
needed a president ``worthy of her people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Polls find the former Red Cross president gaining on top GOP  
contenders and find that education will be a key issue in the 2000 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	She told the educators that while university tenure and  
financing issues dominate discussion of higher education, the focus 
should be on turning out teachers better equipped to instruct a 
generation of students. 
</P>
<P>
	``There should be a zero tolerance policy toward bad teaching,''  
she said. ``If teaching is to become a prestigious profession, 
teachers must undergo rigorous training and hold prestigious 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all know the results of poorly focused learning,'' she  
said. ``Our colleges and universities have to pick up the slack.''

<P>
	Asian stock markets closed mostly lower Monday, but the Tokyo  
index rose following last week's government decision to use public 
funds to support Japan's weakened banks. European stocks finished 
slightly higher in thin volume. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. markets were closed for the Presidents Day holiday.  
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, the benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 stocks rose  
81.03 points, or 0.58 percent, closing at 14,054.72. The index 
gained 21.29 points on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors in Japan were encouraged by the Bank of Japan's  
announcement Friday that it would inject $66 billion into major 
banks in an attempt to prevent Japan's banking system from 
collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks also got a boost after the central bank said Friday it  
was cutting a key interest rate. The Bank of Japan lowered its 
target for overnight call money, the rate banks charge each other 
for unsecured short-term loans, to an all-time low of 0.15 percent 
from 0.25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong stocks fell in a shortened session, with most  
investors sticking to the sidelines ahead of the Chinese New Year 
holiday this week, which will keep markets closed until Friday. The 
Hang Seng Index fell 23.03 points, or 0.2 percent, to 9,402.39. 
</P>
<P>
	In other Asian markets, the Sydney All Ordinaries index fell 0.4  
percent, the Singapore Straits Times Index rose 0.4 percent, and 
the Thai SET index fell 0.7 percent.

<HEADLINE>  Mike Utley Takes a Few Giant Steps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- For the first time since he lay paralyzed on the  
Pontiac Silverdome turf seven years ago, Mike Utley stood in public 
Monday and took a few wobbly steps. 
</P>
<P>
	``By standing up, you feel who you are,'' he said. ``I was 315  
pounds and 6-foot-6. I was proud to be as big as I was. I was proud 
to be as tall as I am. I want it back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Towering over everyone as he did so long ago, wearing a Detroit  
Lions T-shirt, the former offensive lineman made it a few feet down 
a wooden walkway, painfully swinging one leg ahead, then the other. 
</P>
<P>
	He wore lower leg braces to keep his ankles from rolling. A  
friend steadied him on each side. He grimaced as he took each 
excruciating step, his girlfriend Dani Andersen helping him by 
making sure his spindly lower legs stayed straight. 
</P>
<P>
	A couple of times, his legs gave way, and the two buddies on  
each side, retired NFL center Bill Lewis and Lions linebacker Rob 
Frederickson, had to catch him. 
</P>
<P>
	But he made it 10 feet or so.  
</P>
<P>
	``Whew! I'd rather go through double days than that,'' he said  
afterward. ``No, it's exhilarating. Seven years is a long time to 
be sitting in this chair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His sense of humor, a major ally throughout his struggle, was on  
display, too. 
</P>
<P>
	As Utley stood poised for this high drama, a cell phone rang.  
</P>
<P>
	``Dominos,'' he said, imitating the guy who answers at the pizza  
place. 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone laughed.  
</P>
<P>
	Then it was back to business, as it has been every tough day  
since that horrifying moment on Nov. 17, 1991, in the Lions' home 
game against the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	He knew immediately the injury was serious. Two of his vertebrae  
had been crushed. As he was carried off the field, he gave the 
crowd a ``thumbs up'' gesture. 
</P>
<P>
	It's become his trademark, and Utley has come to symbolize grit,  
determination and optimism in the face of grim odds. He vows to 
someday walk off the field from the spot he was injured. He talked 
Monday of someday walking his mom three blocks from her home to 
church. 
</P>
<P>
	He's a long way from that, but those steps in front of a crowd  
of reporters and photographers in a Phoenix hotel conference room 
were an emotional triumph nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was awesome to see him up there,'' Lewis said. ``Yesterday  
when we rehearsed, I was practically in tears. It's nothing short 
of miraculous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Utley, 33, is paralyzed from the chest and elbows down. His  
upper arms still are the bulging biceps of a football lineman. But 
he has only partial control of his hands and lower arms. About two 
years ago, he began to feel some sensations in his legs. He can 
feel his toes, describing it as the way you'd feel on an extremely 
cold day. 
</P>
<P>
	He began working with biofeedback, trying to identify the  
connection between his brain and those few alive nerves in his 
legs. He kept up daily, grueling physical therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rehabilitation is a lifestyle,'' he said. ``It's not something  
you just do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A major reason for his public display, and the pressure that  
came with it, on Monday was his desire to raise more money for his 
Mike Utley Foundation, dedicated research aimed at finding a cure 
for spinal cord injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Utley was quick to point out that no two spinal cord injuries  
are the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing you can control is your mind,'' he said. ``I'm  
not saying everyone will get as far as I've gotten. But they can do 
something today they didn't do yesterday. Maybe they can go 
outside. Maybe they can wheel themselves around the block, and 
maybe tomorrow they can do two blocks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Utley credits his positive attitude for everything he has  
accomplished, whether it be snow skiing, scuba diving, driving his 
specially equipped van or taking those few steps. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good start,'' he said of his effort Monday. ``Is it the  
finish line? Not even close? Will I continue on? Will I walk again? 
You betcha. ... I've taken a few more steps before, but I've never 
gone this far. I want to walk off that Silverdome, and one day I 
will. It might not be tomorrow, but someday I will. I guarantee 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors, who once told him he'd never walk again, now look on  
Utley as a great asset. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives their new patients hope,'' Utley said. ``If you take  
hope away, if you take dreams away, you lose them forever. But it 
goes back to the person. If you're a champion before you got hurt, 
you're a champion now. But you have to work at it. You have to have 
goals. I will never be number two, not today, not tomorrow, not 
ever. Why? Because I believe in myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He talked of going to hospitals to visit children stricken by  
paralyzing injuries, seeing their family's in pain and solidifying 
his determination to find a cure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to see moms and dads cry anymore,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Before he rose for that moment on his feet, he explained why he  
had decided to take these steps publicly. He wanted to show 
doctors, insurance companies and the health industry in general 
that rehabilitation is a lifelong process, something a seriously 
injured person needs to do until he dies. 
</P>
<P>
	And there was a more personal reason.  
</P>
<P>
	``I want to do it for my family and the people who have given me  
support from the first day when I came off that field and gave that 
thumbs up,'' he said, ``everyone in the Detroit organization, the 
friends I've made since I've been hurt. I will show them that I 
have never quit. I will never quit until I am completely free of 
this spinal cord injury.''

<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- For the first time since he lay paralyzed on the  
Pontiac Silverdome turf seven years ago, Mike Utley stood in public 
Monday and took a few wobbly steps. 
</P>
<P>
	``By standing up, you feel who you are,'' he said. ``I was 315  
pounds and 6-foot-6. I was proud to be as big as I was. I was proud 
to be as tall as I am. I want it back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Towering over everyone as he did so long ago, wearing a Detroit  
Lions T-shirt, the former offensive lineman made it a few feet down 
a wooden walkway, painfully swinging one leg ahead, then the other. 
</P>
<P>
	He wore lower leg braces to keep his ankles from rolling. A  
friend steadied him on each side. He grimaced as he took each 
excruciating step, his girlfriend Dani Andersen helping him by 
making sure his spindly lower legs stayed straight. 
</P>
<P>
	A couple of times, his legs gave way, and the two buddies on  
each side, retired NFL center Bill Lewis and Lions linebacker Rob 
Frederickson, had to catch him. 
</P>
<P>
	But he made it 10 feet or so.  
</P>
<P>
	``Whew! I'd rather go through double days than that,'' he said  
afterward. ``No, it's exhilarating. Seven years is a long time to 
be sitting in this chair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His sense of humor, a major ally throughout his struggle, was on  
display, too. 
</P>
<P>
	As Utley stood poised for this high drama, a cell phone rang.  
</P>
<P>
	``Dominos,'' he said, imitating the guy who answers at the pizza  
place. 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone laughed.  
</P>
<P>
	Then it was back to business, as it has been every tough day  
since that horrifying moment on Nov. 17, 1991, in the Lions' home 
game against the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	He knew immediately the injury was serious. Two of his vertebrae  
had been crushed. As he was carried off the field, he gave the 
crowd a ``thumbs up'' gesture. 
</P>
<P>
	It's become his trademark, and Utley has come to symbolize grit,  
determination and optimism in the face of grim odds. He vows to 
someday walk off the field from the spot he was injured. He talked 
Monday of someday walking his mom three blocks from her home to 
church. 
</P>
<P>
	He's a long way from that, but those steps in front of a crowd  
of reporters and photographers in a Phoenix hotel conference room 
were an emotional triumph nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was awesome to see him up there,'' Lewis said. ``Yesterday  
when we rehearsed, I was practically in tears. It's nothing short 
of miraculous.'' 
</P>
