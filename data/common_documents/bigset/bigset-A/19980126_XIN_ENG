<P>
HARARE, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean police Sunday urged
people to report to work next week and ignore widespread rumors
circulating in the capital that people should not go to work.
</P>
<P>
Press and public relations officer of the Zimbabwe republic
police superintendent Wayne Bvudzijena said there was no basis
for the rumors.
</P>
<P>
''We believe some commuter omnibus drivers are being used to
spread these rumors by unscrupulous individuals bent on causing
chaos,'' he said, adding, ''They are taking advantage of the
recent riots to cause confusion among law abiding citizens.''
</P>
<P>
Harare and neighboring Chitungwiza were thrown into turmoil
for three days last week as people protesting against rising
prices for basic food commodities looted and vandalized shops.
</P>
<P>
The officer said police and army officers were still deployed
to effectively deal with the riotous situations which left some
eight people dead in Harare and other towns.
</P>
<P>
''The nation should feel secure with these deployments,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Make Tough Choice on N.Irish Talks </HEADLINE>

<P>
LONDON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Northern Ireland
Secretary Mo Mowlam warned Sunday the current situation facing the
province means some "very tough decision" will have to be made.
</P>
<P>
She told London Weekend Television that the government would
consult all parties involved in the Northern Ireland peace talks
before deciding if the Ulster Democratic Party (UDP), which was
linked to recent killings, could stay in the peace talks to be
resumed Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I and the Irish government will make it, but it is incumbent
on us to talk to all the parties first," she said.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam said the decision must be made on Monday because she did
not want the issue to cloud the week's discussions.
</P>
<P>
But the decision was not easy to make. If the UDP stays in the
talks, the underlying principles may be destroyed, and mainstream
political parties may walk out of the talks.
</P>
<P>
If the UDP is banned from the peace process, one of the major
loyalist groups will not be committed to any final agreement and
violence would possibly continue.
</P>
<P>
In the past month, nine people have been killed in the revenge
assassinations after a loyalist military group leader was gunned
down.

<HEADLINE> Pak Economy to Come Out of Crunch Next Year: Aziz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Finance Minister
Sartaj Aziz said Sunday that the country would fully come out of
the present economic crunch in the next financial year starting
from July 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The economic situation has been improving and it will continue
so provided the economic atmosphere in this region continues to be
favorable," said Aziz while talking to the local media in Multan,
a major city of Punjab province, according to the Associated Press
of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Terming 1998 as a better year for the country's economy, Aziz
said, "The government is trying to improve revenue recovery
instead of relying upon new taxes."
</P>
<P>
He said that Pakistan will have to pay 150 billion rupees
(about 3.4 billion U.S. dollars) in the foreign debt servicing
sector this year, and the amount of payment will increase every
year with passage of time.
</P>
<P>
So it is vital for the country to enhance its domestic growth
rate, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Referring to various steps adopted by the government, Aziz said
that the growth rate of the gross domestic product (GDP) in the
current fiscal year would be 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
And the agriculture sector, which accounts for about 25 percent
of the GDP, is also expected to achieve a growth rate of 5
percent, said Aziz. It is enough to avert the economic collapse,
he added.
</P>
<P>
On the revival of the industrial sector, Aziz hoped that
similar achievements would also be registered as a number of
packages had already been introduced.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the deficit in the balance of payments had
been reduced from 1.6 billion dollars to one billion dollars. He
expressed the hope that the situation would be further improved in
the days to come.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Aziz highlighted the role of privatization and said
"this process needs to be further geared up."

<HEADLINE> Zambian Government Calls for Collective Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government here
today called for collective action against the rising tides of
crime which has assumed higher proportions and become more
sophisticated for conventional means of control.
</P>
<P>
Officially closing the first four-day crime conference held in
the capital, Home Affairs Deputy Minister Peter Muliga said that
economic development in many countries has given rise to a higher
crime rate.
</P>
<P>
"These development-related crimes have become regional and
international in scope, thus necessitating equally wider and
collective intergrated and international actions," said the
official.
</P>
<P>
Muliga pointed out that the traditional control measures have
become insufficient to cope with new forms of crimes such as
robberies, car thefts, drug abuse and drug trafficking, the
Zambia News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
He added that many preventive measures taken by police in
order to keep law and order have often placed restrictions on the
rights and freedom of the people, thereby creating
misunderstanding between law enforcement agencies and the public.
</P>
<P>
There is need for both the law enforcement officers and the
public to understand and appreciate each other's roles and
expectations so as to avoid unnecessary confrontation and
violation of human rights, Muliga stressed.
</P>
<P>
He urged that participants from the Zambia Police,
Anti-corruption Commission, Private Security Services, business
community and other organizations to turn the resolutions of the
conference into practical policy measures.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Provides Ethiopia $509 million Soft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank and the
Ethiopian government signed here on Sunday two agreements to
provide a total of 509 million US Dollars of soft loans to the
sub-Saharan Africa's second most populous nation.
</P>
<P>
The two agreements were signed by Ethiopian Finance Minister
Sufian Ahmed and World Bank Vice-president for Africa Callisto
Madavo, according to a press release available here Sunday.
Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and visiting World Bank
President James Wolfensohn also attended the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
According to the press release, two projects financed by the
International Development Association (IDA), which is soft-loan
arm of the World Bank, are a roads sector development program
worth 309 million US Dollars and the Gilgel Gibe Hydroelectric
Power Project worth 200 million US Dollars. The roads project is
the largest IDA commitment yet made in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
The road project is intended as the first phase of IDA support
to the government of Ethiopia's 10-year road sector development
program, the press release said. The project will restore and
expand Ethiopia's road network, improve management of road
agencies, and create jobs and affordable transportation for the
rural poor, it added.
</P>
<P>
The Gilgel Gibe Hydroelectric Project on the Gilgel Gibe
River, which is located at Sekoru, about 260 kms south-west of
Addis Ababa, has a generating capacity of 184 MW.
</P>
<P>
The project is designed to increase access to electricity for
both economic growth and improvement in the quality of life, the
press release said.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, Russia to Strengthen Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus and Russia will
strengthen their bilateral relations in all fields, Cypriot
Finance Minister Christodoulos Christodoulou said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Larnaca Airport upon his return from Russia,
Christodoulou stressed that a new period in Cyprus-Russia
relations is opening up in all fields, especially the economic,
trade, tourist and investment sectors.
</P>
<P>
Christodoulou was in Moscow for the first session of the joint
inter-governmental committee on trade and economic cooperation
between Cyprus and the Russian Federation.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, two cooperation agreements, on agriculture
and the prevention of calamities, were signed by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Christodoulou said Cyprus has announced that it would spend 1
million U.S. dollars to carry out studies for encouraging Cypriot
business activities in Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government would also offer scholarships to
Russians, in fields relating to free economy, he added.
</P>
<P>
Christodoulou also expressed his belief that there will be an
increase in the number of Russian tourists visiting Cyprus this
year.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Cyprus' missile deal with Russia, the minister
said Russia will fulfill its obligation to safely bring the
Russian-made surface-to-air missile system S-300 to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The government of Cyprus ordered the S-300 in January 1997, in
a bid to boost its air defense. The system is expected to be
delivered later this year.
</P>
<P>
However, Turkey, a long-time foe that support Turkish Cypriots
in the north of the country, has threatened to take preemptive
measures if the missiles are deployed.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into Greek Cypriot south and
Turkish Cypriot north since Turkey sent troops and seized the
northern third of the island in 1974 in the wake of a failed
pro-Athens coup.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Reacts to Turkey's Threat over Air Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government has
challenged Turkey to bring its complaints about the Paphos air
base before the U.N., stressing that in such a case Ankara would
also have to explain its disregard of U.N. resolutions on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to state radio and TV Sunday, Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides said that if Turkey goes before the U.N. Security
Council it would have to account for its contempt of U.N.
resolutions on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He said that Ankara would also have to explain why it illegally
maintains occupation troops on the island since its invasion in
1974.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides' words came in response to a Turkish announcement
Saturday that it would bring the case of Paphos air base to the
attention of the U.N. chief and the head of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry also threatened in its statement to
"continue to take the necessary measures against any threat to the
security of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) as well
as its own soil."
</P>
<P>
The breakaway TRNC, declared by Turkish Cypriots in 1983 on the
northern part of the island, has been recognized only by Turkey,
which maintains some 35,000 troops there.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot military air base at the western coastal town of
Paphos in the Greek Cypriot-controlled south was constructed
within the framework of a joint defense pact with Greece in
1993. It will be used by Greek air force planes.
</P>
<P>
The base has been completed and was handed over to the National
Guard by the contractors on Saturday, but its formal inauguration
will not take place until after the presidential elections, to be
held on February 8.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides has said he would propose to
the Council of Ministers to name the base after Papandreou, to
honour the late Greek premier, who had conceived the idea of the
joint defense pact and the construction of the air base.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister George Charalambides reiterated the base was
"a clearly defensive project and will be used only in incidents
when Cyprus suffers an attack."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Says US-Israeli Gaps Narrowed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that differences between Israel
and the United States over the Middle East peace process have been
narrowed following his meeting with President Bill Clinton Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to an Israeli Cabinet statement, Netanyahu briefed
his ministers on his talks with Clinton and other American
officials last week in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said efforts will be made to carry out Clinton's
proposal that would have Israel hand over small parcels of land in
the second redeployment while the Palestinians take matching steps
against terrorists.
</P>
<P>
He said that any deal worked out with the U.S. will be brought
to the cabinet to formulate its own resolution. He also conceded
that there are still some gaps between the Israeli and American
positions on the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu reiterated in the cabinet that Israel will not hand
over any more territory to the Palestinians until a clear course
is set by the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to fulfill its
security commitments as stipulated in the Israeli-Palestinian
accords.
</P>
<P>
He said he had made it clear in Washington that the Israeli
list of its national interests in the territories is not a tactic
to restrict the further redeployment but rather a substantive
issue.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Clinton, Netanyahu insisted that before
Israel implements the second redeployment in the West Bank, the
Palestinian National Council must be reconvened to cancel all the
articles in the Palestinian Covenant calling for Israel's
destruction.
</P>
<P>
However, Clinton demanded that Israel commence its redeployment
immediately, while the Palestinians would also begin to comply
with their part in the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the letter handed by the PNA President Yasser
Arafat to Clinton, which specified that those anti-Israeli
articles have been repealed, Netanyahu declared that a letter is
not enough but rather authorized bodies must make such a decision.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also warned the Palestinians that Israel would react
firmly if Palestinians resort to, or threaten violence.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel will not agree to conduct a peace process
under dictates of violence and the Palestinian side should
understand the only option to the peace is deliberation and
achieving understanding with Israel.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader of Islamic
fundamentalist Hamas movement, called on all the Palestinians to
unite in an armed struggle against Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said this is "the only way left to the Palestinians to gain
their rights and achieve their goals" and called on Arafat to join
the movement in waging a "holy war" against Israeli occupiers.

<HEADLINE> King Hussein, Mubarak Discuss Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
held two-hour talks with visiting King Hussein of Jordan Sunday
afternoon on the latest developments of the Mideast peace process
and relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The king, who arrived here Sunday afternoon on a surprise
visit, has flown home Sunday evening. Neither side has spoken to
reporters at the end of the talks.
</P>
<P>
When announcing the lightning visit Sunday, Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa said the visit is significant as "it came on
the heels of the meetings which were held in Washington and the
unchanged Israeli stand."
</P>
<P>
"The visit also takes place before Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat's arrival here tomorrow," he said, "The visits of King
Hussein and Arafat are the start of a series of Arab
consultations," Moussa added.
</P>
<P>
Hussein's visit came days after U.S. President Bill Clinton met
separately with Palestinian National Authority President Yasser
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who paid visits to Algeria and Tunisia Sunday, is
expected to arrive here on Monday to discuss with Mubarak what the
next step should be to save the faltering peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have deadlocked since March
1996 after Israel started building a new settlement in Arab East
Jerusalem. The recent Washington talks have failed to break the
ice.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Egypt are the only two Arab countries that have
signed peace treaties with Israel, and have worked to bridge the
gaps between the Palestinians and Israelis after the crisis
erupted.

<HEADLINE> Leprosy Cases in Tanzania Under Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has
successfully managed to control the chronic infectious disease of
leprosy, Health Minister Aaron Chiduo said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an occasion in the Tabora Region to mark the World
Leprosy Day, the minister said that Tanzanian government has
managed to reduce leprosy cases by 94 percent in the Mtwara
Region, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Leprosy cases have dropped drastically from 35,000 in 1983 to
3,000 cases in 1996 in Tanzania, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, statistics indicated that the cases worldwide have
fallen below one million at present from two million 35 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Chiduo said that the World Health Organization (WHO) has set
the year 2000 as the deadline for the complete elimination of the
disease, which is caused by mycobacterium, leprae and chiefly
affects skin and peripheral nerves.
</P>
<P>
In order to attain the goal, the Ministry of Health, through
the National Leprosy and Tuberculosis Program, has planned
different strategies such as educating the public on the
disease, he said.
</P>
<P>
World Leprosy Day is marked annually on the last Sunday of
every January.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Deputy Minister of Health Gladness Mziray said at
a seminar in Dar es Salaam the disease will be wiped out if
people would hold a co-operative attitude, such as going to
hospitals and health centers after contracting the disease.
</P>
<P>
She said the ministry will work with the WHO in exploring the
possibility of reducing the period of curing leprosy from the
present two years to one year.

<HEADLINE> Arafat to Brief Mubarak on Washington Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat is due here Monday to brief Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak on results of his talks with U.S.
President Bill Clinton in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Ambassador to Egypt Zohdi al-Kedra said Sunday the
meeting will tackle the latest developments of the Mideast peace
process "which is deteriorating because of the Israeli obstinacy."
</P>
<P>
Kedra attributed the failure of Washington talks to the
hardline stances of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
expressed his hope that the U.S. would put more pressure on the
Israeli government to ensure the implementation of the previously
signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
"Israel's failure to implement the agreements of the safe
corridor, Gaza airport and the second stage redeployment were
behind the stalled peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said despite the Israeli premier's intransigence, the
Palestinians who struggle for peace, right, justice and freedom
will ultimately triumph. "This peace cannot be destroyed because
of the beliefs of the Israeli premier," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian ambassador said the PNA still considers the
U.S. a main partner in the peace process but warned that the
present stalemate might affect the whole Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
"It is high time that Europe play an effective and genuine role
in the Middle East peace process notably on the Palestinian and
Israeli track," he said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, during a visit in Algiers Sunday, called for holding an
emergency Arab summit to look into the latest developments in the
Arab world, with particular focus on the Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is expected to discuss with Mubarak on Monday what the
next step should be in order to save the faltering Mideast peace
process.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein of Jordan made a surprise visit to Cairo Sunday
for talks with Mubarak on pushing forward the peace process, which
a senior Egyptian official said marked the commencement of a
series of Arab consultations.
</P>
<P>

Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Karabakh is Obstacle in Azerbaijan-Russia Relations, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Karabakh and illegal Russian
arms shipment to Armenia were obstacles in development of the
Azerbaijan's relations with Russia and the other states of the
Commonwealth of Independent States(CIS), Azerbaijani Foreign
Minister Gasan Gasanov said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Karabakh, a former autonomous region of Azerbaijan, proclaimed
the founding of a republic in September 1991, breaking away from
Azerbaijan. In 1988, Karabakh approved a resolution demanding to
join Armenia.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency quoted the minister as reporting from
Baku, capital of Azerbaijan, that Azerbaijan this year would
undoubtedly continue pressing for a return to Russia of the
weapons worth over one billion U.S. dollars, received by Armenia
illegally.
</P>
<P>
Gasanov emphasized that "this issue will be resolved only when
all the illegally transferred weapons are withdrawn from Armenia."
</P>
<P>
On the Kremlin's willingness to pay more attention to the
problems of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the
minister said that Azerbaijan thought that the Commonwealth had
not resolved the main issue -- a system of peace relationships
between the CIS member states. There virtually was a state of war
between Armenia and Azerbaijan, he added.
</P>
<P>
Gasanov expressed regret over that Russia has never condemned
Armenia's aggression against Azerbaijan, saying,"for a number of
reasons, Russia can and must play a special role in settling the
Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict."
</P>
<P>
He said Russia, as chairman of CIS and co-chairman of the
Minsk-based group of the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe (OSCE), assigned to settle the conflict, should help
resolve the issue.

<HEADLINE> Iran Produces 4.6 Million Tonnes Steel in 9 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 25 (Xinhua) - Iran has produced more than 4.6
million tonnes of steel during the first nine months of the
current Iranian calendar year ending March 20, the Iranian
official news agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted a report of the Iranian Mines and Metals
Ministry as saying that three major steel producers - the
Khuzestan Steel Complex, the Mobarakeh Steel Complex and Isfahan
Steel Mill - produced 1.1 million, 1.8 million and 1.6 million
tonnes of steel respectively from March 21 to December 20, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Iran's steel industry enjoyed a fast growth after the end of
the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war following huge investments by the
Iranian government. The annual steel production has climbed to 6
million tonnes in last Iranian calendar year from 90,000 tonnes
before the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Iran's ambitious second five-year development plan (1995-2000)
predicted a steel production of 10.5 million tonnes in 1999, with
1.3 million tonnes of that for export.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the country expected a steel production of 8
million tonnes by the end of the current Iranian year, of which
more than 1 million tonnes will be exported.
</P>
<P>
However, the Mines and Metals Ministry did not give the figure
of steel exports during the first nine months of this year and
that of last Iranian year.
</P>
<P>
Iran is now building another steel production center, the Yazd
Steel Alloy Factory, which is expected to go into operation in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
In the report, the ministry said that the country's molten
aluminum output reached 66,000 tonnes in the same period, a 47
percent increase over a year earlier, while molded aluminum
products topped 67,000 tonnes, up 28 percent.

<HEADLINE> Liberians Hold Farewell Party for ECOMOG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Liberians held a big farewell
party in the capital Monrovia at the weekend to mark the
departure of the west African peacekeeping force ECOMOG next
week.
</P>
<P>
Crowds of about 12,000 people assembled at downtown Monrovia
on Sunday morning with banners saying "ECOMOG, we love you!"
"Thank you, ECOMOG!" and "Farewell, our west African friends!"
</P>
<P>
Every contingent of ECOMOG was represented by a parade with a
specific number of troops from the contributing countries during
the celebration, the British Broadcasting Corporation reported
today.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG was sent to Liberia in 1990 in the heat of the civil
war which was ignited by the battle launched by former warlord
and the current president Charles Taylor against the previous
government.
</P>
<P>
The sub-regional force has helped end the seven-year bloody
civil war which claimed the lives of 150,000 people, displaced
about one million others and destroyed the national economy.
</P>
<P>
The peacekeepers also provided security for a successful
election that brought Taylor to the nation's top seat.
</P>
<P>
Several west African countries have dispatched their troops to
join the ECOMOG contingent, which is expected to leave the
country next week.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, elsewhere in the city and surrounding
towns, people gathered around the radio sets all day listening to
a live broadcast of the parade by two local radio stations.
</P>
<P>
"Because of ECOMOG, we can now travel throughout Liberia and
we can sit in the classroom in peace," some Liberian children
were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
People worked when the children called for a moment of silence
in memory of ECOMOG soldiers who died in combat.
</P>
<P>
The children said when the history of this country is being
written 15 years from now, a good work of ECOMOG should be mentioned
in bold.
</P>
<P>
An ECOMOG officer was quoted as saying that the multinational
force was willing to help train Liberia's post-war army, an issue
that has led to friction between President Taylor and former
ECOMOG force commander Maj.-gen. Victor Malu.
</P>
<P>
Taylor reportedly did not want ECOMOG to be involved in the
restructuring and training of the Liberian armed forces, saying
that it was his constitutional right to do the job by himself.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG's involvement in the exercise is included in the peace
accord that brought the Liberian civil war to an end. Taylor is
one of the signatories of the accord.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses US Arms Inspector of Lying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Iraq Sunday accused Richard
Sebritzel, an American in the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in
charge of dismantling Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, of
telling lies for prolonging the sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Sebritzel in charge of the biological file has reportedly said
that he had information to prove that Iraq was operating a secret
plant for biological weapons in defiance of the U.N.-imposed
embargo.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that he has no tangible evidence that can be
tabled to the U.N. Security Council. If such evidence was
available, it would put an end to the ongoing controversy on the
lifting of the U.N. sanctions on Iraq, he said.
</P>
<P>
Responding to these remarks, Major General Eng. Hussam Mohammed
Amin, director of the Iraqi peer of the UNSCOM, said "We are not
astonished at such mean remarks from one of the U.S. officials who
are responsible for the prolonging of the UNSCOM mission."
</P>
<P>
The continuation of the embargo serves the political
interests of the United States that tends to untrue accusations
and lies, the Iraq News Agency quoted Amin as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We defy Sebritzel to provide any evidence for his claims on
the existence of the alleged plant in the presence of the
representatives of the world mass media," the Iraqi official
added.

<HEADLINE> Uzbekistan Cyclist Disqualified for One Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 26 (Xinhua) - A Swiss-based sporting court on
Monday overturned the Uzbekistan Cycling Federation's decision to
impose a six-month ban on a rider caught doping six times last
year.
</P>
<P>
The International Cycling Union (ICU), in a statement about the
case, said 34-year-old Djamolidin Abdoujaparov had been barred for
a year, fined 4,000 Swiss francs (2,790 U.S. dollars) and had 300
ranking points deducted.
</P>
<P>
Abdoujaparov tested positive at six international cycling
events, including the Tour de France, last year and he would lose
50 ranking points for each event, the ICU said.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss-based Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), enjoying
growing support from sporting organizations seeking to stamp out
doping, imposed the one-year ban from July 12, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The ban will expire as the 1998 Tour de France begins.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that the Lausanne-based cycling body had
used the CAS to have a national body's decision overturned,
according to the ICU.
</P>
<P>
The CAS is backed by the International Olympic Committee and
is already used by swimming authorities for doping decisions.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Protests Against US Violation of Air Space </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has reiterated its protest
to the U.N. against the continued violation of its air space by
U.S. aircraft as well as U.S. threats to its sovereignty and
territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
The text of the protest, broadcast by the Iraqi News Agency
Monday, was carried in a letter by the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign
Affairs to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan and to the current
president of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The ministry pointed out that U.S. aircraft had carried out 454
sorties from January 17 to 21 overflying Iraqi territories.
</P>
<P>
The letter of protest said that U.S. reconnaissance planes TR-1
had carried out 4 sorties during the period, flying at an altitude
of 20 kilometers and a speed of 600 kilometers an hour.
</P>
<P>
It called upon the U.N. chief and the Security Council
president to put an end to these acts which threaten civilian
citizens, asserting Iraq's right to demand legal indemnities for
the damages befalling the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the news agency report said that Iraq had informed
the Arab League (AL) of the continued violation of its airspace by
the American, British and French warplanes taking off from bases
in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
It added that the Iraqi delegate to the Arab League had
requested the AL Secretary General Esmat Abdul Meguid to help cease
such violations which contradicted with all Arab laws and accords.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has proposed to freeze discussions or actions with respect
to the question of U.N. inspectors' access to presidential sites
before technical evaluation meetings have come to an end in
April. But U.N. chief inspector has rejected the proposal.

Kuwait's first Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister
Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah received a letter from
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, in which she renewed
the U.S. firm commitment to Kuwait's security and praised
bilateral relations, according to Kuna.
</P>
<P>
Albright praised the outcome of the 18th Gulf Cooperation

with U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
She also expressed the welcome to the GCC leaders' praise to

promote bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The letter also underlined the importance of sparing Kuwait
any repercussion from the recent standoff between Iraq and the

Iraq has proposed to freeze discussions or actions with respect
to the question of inspectors' access to presidential sites before
technical evaluation meetings have come to an end in April. But
U.N. chief inspector Richard Butler has rejected the proposal.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Kuwait's Foreign Undersecretary
Suleiman Majed Al-Shaheen Monday held talks with the
U.S. ambassador to Kuwait on regional and international issues of
common concern, Kuna reported.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait signed defense treaties with the U.S. and France
following the 1991 Gulf War which helped to drive the Iraqi
occupation troops out from the small Gulf emirate.
</P>
<P>
The agreements stipulate the two countries' commitment to
supply arms to Kuwait and carry out joint military exercises
within the framework of defense cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Cost of Wheat Import to Rise Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan may have to spend
one billion U.S. dollars in importing wheat during the current
fiscal year and the cost for the first six months rose 176 percent
in dollar terms compared to the previous corresponding period.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, which is struggling to meet the growing domestic
demand for wheat, has imported a total of 2.864 million tons in
the first half of the current fiscal year starting July 1. The
cost is estimated at about 509 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, during the same period of the previous fiscal year,
the import of wheat was 906,000 tons at a cost of 184.3 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to market sources, the growing demand for wheat in
the country is mainly due to the lower growth rate and the
smuggling problem.
</P>
<P>
The government is making efforts to increase wheat production
by offering incentives and providing loans through the
Agricultural Development Bank. It is also making efforts to
increase the per acre yield.
</P>
<P>
However, local economists believe that the margin of profit in
wheat has gone down because of high cost of inputs like
fertilizers, and higher inflation. This has discouraged wheat
growers from making extra efforts to raise production.

<P>
MOSCOW, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
stressed the need Monday to make a maximum effort for
rapprochement between Russia and the European Union (EU),
according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin made the remark while meeting with Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov, who is leaving for Brussels to take part in the
first session of the Council for Cooperation Between Russia and
the EU at the foreign-ministerial level.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the agreement on Russia-EU partnership and
cooperation, which started in December last year, Yeltsin said it
is necessary now to clear away obstacles in the development of
Russia-EU economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also instructed the foreign minister to start preparing
a Russia-EU summit for the spring of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president commended the draft agreement on
Russian-Japanese cooperation in fishing, which is expected to be
signed in Moscow after careful studies by the two governments.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Yeltsin and Primakov also discussed issues
pertaining to the legal status of the Caspian Sea and the
operation of a transitional pipeline across Russia.

<HEADLINE> France Opposes Military Attack on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 26 (Xinhua) -- France continues to oppose a
military attack upon Iraq for its refusal to cooperate with United
Nations arms inspectors, said French Foreign Ministry sources
Monday.
</P>
<P>
France will deliver this message to United Nations Secretary
General Kofi Annan when he visits Paris Monday evening. France
will also show its solidarity with the U.N. by being firm in its
stand toward Baghdad, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
President Jacques Chirac, who is in India but scheduled to
leave Monday, said he hoped the Iraqi government "could
understand that there is another way other than confrontation.
</P>
<P>
"We think that Iraq should accept honestly the application of
all U.N. resolutions and allow inspection of the so-called
presidential sites," he said at a news conference in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Yevegeny Primakov will visit
Paris on Wednesday to discuss with French leaders the situation in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Both Russia and France are opposed to a military option in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The United States said Sunday that it could act alone in a
military action -- possibly with the support of Britain -- if Iraq
does not make any concessions by the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
The chief of the U.N. Special Commission on arms inspection
(UNSCOM) Richard Butler failed to reach an agreement with Iraq over
inspection of presidential sites when he visited Baghdad last week.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government said it could not accept the
"humiliations" from UNSCOM inspectors who regard Iraq as a
"conquered country."

BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Symposiums were held today in
China's southern coastal cities of Fujian, Xiamen, and Guangzhou
to mark the third anniversary of President Jiang Zemin's
Eight-Point Proposal on the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
Participants said that the two sides of the Taiwan Straits have
seen increasing economic and cultural exchanges since Jiang put
forth his Eight-Point Proposal and that the "peaceful
reunification and one country, two systems" principle is the
aspiration of all the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Xi Jinping, deputy secretary of the Fujian provincial CPC

<HEADLINE> Reconstruction of Tooth Relic Temple Begins in S.Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Reconstruction work on the
Dalada Kaligawa (Tooth Relic Temple) in Kandy, which was damaged
in Sunday's bomb attack, began Monday, the Government Information
Department said.
</P>
<P>
President Chandrika Kumaratunga has allocated 20 million Rupees
(322,581 U.S. dollars) from her presidential fund for the
reconstruction project.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project will be completed in a few days
to meet the deadline of the February 4 Independence Day
celebrations while the second phase could take two years to
complete.
</P>
<P>
The entrance, roof and outer wall of the temple were damaged
due to the explosion, which is believed to be the work of the
death squads of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Capital Radio Station reported that about 500
Buddhist monks staged a demonstration in Kandy Monday in protest
against the bombing of their holiest place of worship.
</P>
<P>
Security in Kandy has been strengthened. But the situation
there was relatively calm as most of the shops opened for business
one day after the blast.
</P>
<P>
A truck driven by suicide LTTE attackers exploded near the
Dalada Kaligawa Sunday morning, killing 12 people and injuring
more than 23 others.
</P>
<P>
The Dalada Kaligawa, where Sri Lankan Buddhists go to pay their
homage to the sacred tooth relic believed to be belonging to the
Buddha, has been surrounded by a large number of security
personnel.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Vows to Defend Interests of Turkish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Turkey reiterated on Monday
that it will take necessary steps to defend the interests of
Turkish Cypriots and its own as well.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Necati Utkan told a weekly
news briefing that Turkey considered the newly built Paphos air
base in Cyprus as a threat to the security of Turkish Cypriots
and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"We are following the development very closely," Utkan said,
"and we are bringing this issue to the secretary-general of the
United Nations and the president of the Security Council."
</P>
<P>
He added that Turkey, as a guarantor country, will take
every measure against the development that might jeopardize the
security of Turkish Cypriots and Turkey itself.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus had reportedly completed the construction of the air
base in the port city of Paphos, which will be used by the
Greek air force planes following the Cypriot presidential
elections scheduled for February 8.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot and Greek governments signed a joint defense
pact in 1993 in order to contend with the military pressure
from Turkey, whose 35,000-strong troops are now stationed in
northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Utkan quoted an earlier statement made by Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash as saying that "the (Greek) planes which
take off from the Paphos air base will not have an
opportunity to land."
</P>
<P>
In response to Turkey's reaction, Cypriot Foreign Minister
Ioannis Kasoulides said on Sunday that Turkey has to explain
to the U.N. Security Council its occupation of northern Cyprus
when it brings the new air base case to the world body.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey sent
troops and took over the northern third of the eastern
Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
Although the Uninted Nations and international community had
taken pains to seek a reunification of the island state, the
rival Greek and Turkish Cypriots failed to reach any agreement on
key issues.
</P>
<P>
Following last December Luxembourg summit at which the
European Union leaders formally invited Cyprus to the accession
talks, Denktash announced the Cyprus peace process "was actually
dead."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- China Charity Federation (CCF)
announced today that it will provide a namelist of people and
organizations who have made relief donations for earthquake
victims near Zhangjiakou for publication in a popular local
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Zhangjiakou, in northwestern part of north China's Hebei
Province, was hit by a magnitude 6.2 earthquake on January 10,
leaving 50 people dead, more than 10,000 injured, and over 100,000
houses damaged.
</P>
<P>
CCF made an urgent appeal on January 12 for humanitarian aid,
and in the following two weeks received more than five million
yuan (600,000 US dollars) in donations.
</P>
<P>
"We were so surprised by the prompt and active response that we
decided to provide detailed information about all donations we
received," Yang Tuan, CCF deputy secretary-general, said. The
names will appear in the Tuesday edition of Beijing Youth Daily.
</P>
<P>
The largest donation came from Guangzhou Jockey Club of
Guangdong Province, which gave one million yuan. Y.K. Lee, a Hong
Kong resident, topped the list of individual donors with 50,000
Hong Kong dollars.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 foreign companies, including the Reuters
Foundation, Britain's Rolls Royce, the US's Exxon China Ltd., and
the Netherlands' Philips China Co. Ltd. have made donations.
</P>
<P>
CCF commended the work of two volunteer groups, the Philip
Hayden Foundation and Dragon Net Technologies Ltd.
</P>
<P>
CCF went on to say that a large part of the donations will be
used for makeshift housing, which can also serve as temporary
classrooms for students in the quake area.
</P>
<P>
Each house will contain the names of donors, and some donors
will be invited to visit students in these classrooms when school
resumes on March 1, Yang noted.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Local Economy Worsening: Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Local branch managers of the Bank
of Japan (BOJ) reported Monday that their regional economies are
deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
Most of the central bank's 33 managers attending a two-day
quarterly meeting said the economy of their respective region has
become stagnant, with personal consumption and housing investment
remaining weak.
</P>
<P>
The managers' assessment represents apparent downgrade from
that in their previous meeting last October when they said
regional economies were weakening.
</P>
<P>
Sharing almost the same view as the branch managers on the
current economic situation, BOJ Governor Yasuo Matsuchita said in
his opening speech that the Japanese economy has become stagnant.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, the central bank will strive to
simultaneously bring about the stabilization of Japan's ailing
financial system and the recovery of its economy.
</P>
<P>
Matsushita cited as steps to realize these goals its readiness
to inject sufficient funds into the money market to tackle the
restrictive lending stance of financial institutions and to
stabilize the market.
</P>
<P>
On its monetary policy, the BOJ chief said the central bank
will maintain the current easy monetary policy for the time
being.

<HEADLINE> British Carrier Enters Gulf to Strengthen Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 26 (Xinhua) -- British aircraft carrier HMS
Invincible and a supply ship have entered the Gulf waters to
reinforce possible allied operations against Iraq, the Bahraini
News Agency monitored here reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The carrier will carry out training exercises with allied
forces in the region," the agency quoted Caroline Alcock,
spokeswoman for the British Embassy in Bahrain, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The carrier reached the Gulf on Sunday after sailing through
the Strait of Hormuz, she said. It was accompanied by the supply
ship Fort Victoria.
</P>
<P>
The carrier joined the HMS Nottingham and HMS Coventry, British
destroyers that are part of the Western flotilla enforcing the
U.N. sanctions against Iraq, said Alcock. However, she did not say
how long the Invincible will stay in the region.
</P>
<P>
The British carrier arrived in the Gulf amid mounting tensions
between Iraq and the U.N. on arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been barring the U.N. inspectors from entering
so-called "sensitive sites," including presidential compounds, on
ground of sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
It also has blocked the work of teams that it said had too many
"Anglo-Saxon members," meaning Americans and Britons.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain reacted with the threat of
using military action against Iraq
</P>
<P>
The U.S. already has two carriers in the region. The two are
the USS Nimitz and the USS George Washington.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under the U.N. sanctions since its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait. The sanctions can not be lifted unless the arms

<HEADLINE> Iraq Wants No Military Confrontation with US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of Iraq's National
Assembly (parliament) Saadoun Hammadi on Monday said Iraq does not
want a military confrontation with the U.S, but will defense
itself in the event of an aggression.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot definitely tell if the U.S. is going to commit
aggression on Iraq. A military confrontation would better not take
place, nor do we want such a thing to happen," Hammadi said during
an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"But if it takes place we would defend ourselves," he stated.
</P>
<P>
Local media are speculating that the U.S. government might be
more inclined now than ever before to launch an attack on Iraq in
order to divert public attention from the unfolding sex scandal of
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq's National Assembly debated this question (U.N. weapons
inspection) last June and decided to give the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) six months to finalize its task, as it is
impossible to let the UNSCOM prolong the embargo indefinitely," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Hammadi pointed out that six months is a sufficient period for
UNSCOM to finalize its tasks in Iraq. He accused UNSCOM of
fabricating problems, such as the inspection of presidential and
sovereign sites, in a bid to justify aggravating the sufferings of
Iraqi people.

TUNIS, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat left Tunis Monday for London after having a meeting with
Tunisian President Zine Al-Abidine Bin Ali during his brief visit
this north African nation.
</P>
<P>
According to the Tunisian news agency, Arafat briefed the
Tunisian president about his talks in Washington with
U.S. President Bill Clinton on the prospective revival of the
stalled peace process between the Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from the meeting with President Ali, Arafat said his
talks in Washington were extremely difficult in view of Israeli
intransigence, adding that the U.S. Administration had felt these
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Arafat criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
saying that Netanyahu had come up with nothing new to push the
peace process forward and to salvage it from the present deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Arafat pointed out that agreement had been reached that U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright would follow up her mission
with the hope of activating the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian president also stressed in his statements that
the Palestinian people who had suffered a great deal and had faced
lots of difficulties would ultimately triumph.
</P>
<P>
President Arafat arrived in Tunis Sunday afternoon on a visit
within the framework of a North Africa tour covering, besides
Tunisia, Mauritania, Morocco and Algeria to brief their leaders
about the outcome of his talks with U.S. President Clinton.

<HEADLINE> UAE to Pump 12 Billion Dollars into Development in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) is expected to pump over 12 billion U.S. dollars into
development in 1998, with nearly half coming from private
investors, the UAE's Wam News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Investments are projected to reach some 12.7 billion dollars
this year, of which around 6.1 billion dollars will come from the
private sector, Wam quoted UAE's Minister of Planning Sheikh
Humaid Bin Ahmed al-Mu'alla as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister gave no figures for investment in 1997, but some
UAE officials estimated the number at around 12 billion
dollars. In 1996, the country's investment stood at 11.2 billion
dollars, of which nearly 45 percent came from private sector.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, investment in 1998 will mainly focus
on oil, real estate and light industry sectors.
</P>
<P>
The UAE government has not yet released the federal budget for
1998 apparently because of the turmoil in the oil market, where
crude prices have dived to their lowest level in nearly four
years.
</P>
<P>
UAE oil exports have generated at least 12 billion dollars
annually over the past five years, accounting for more than 80
percent of its total revenue.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Rebuffs Syria's Accusations on Democracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Turkey on Monday categorically
rejected a senior Syrian official's statement that Turkey is
destroying its democratic system.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a weekly press conference here, Turkish Foreign
Ministry spokesman Necati Utkan said Syria's Defense Minister
Mustafa Tlass made "inappropriate and uncalled-for" remarks on
Turkey's democracy.
</P>
<P>
According to local press, Tlass said last week, in a joint
interview with the Kuwaiti newspaper al-Rai al-Aam and Abud Dhabi
television, that Turkey might become another Algeria.
</P>
<P>
"If the (ruling military authorities) do not return to justice
and respect Islamic principles, the Turkish people will take their
revenge and Turkey will become exactly like Algeria," Tlass said.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian minister added that "Turkey's democracy is starting
to burn and what is happening now is not correct."
</P>
<P>
Tlass' remarks followed a controversial ruling recently made by
Turkey's Constitutional Court which outlawed the pro-Islamic
Welfare Party (RP) and banned its leader Necmettin Erbakan from
engaging in politics for five years.
</P>
<P>
Last June, the powerful Turkish military, which calls itself a
protector of the country's secularism and democracy, exerted
pressure on then Prime Minister Erbakan, forcing the stepping
down of the RP-led coalition.
</P>
<P>
Algeria, a secular Muslim country, was thrown into chaos in
January 1992 when the top brass canceled a general election in
which the Islamic Salvation Front was poised to win.
</P>
<P>
About 65,000 people have been killed since then by armed
Islamic groups which declared an open-end war against the
Algerian government.
</P>
<P>
Turning down Tlass' criticism, Utkan said "Turkey does not need
to take lessons from Syria, neither on democracy nor on religious
tolerance."
</P>
<P>
The Syrian defense minister's remarks are not served for
improving the Turkish-Syrian relations, he added.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Syria have shared a bitter relationship due to
disputes over water resources and the alleged Damascus support for
the Kurdish Workers' Party, which has been fighting a separatist
war against Turkish government since 1984.

<HEADLINE> Official Hopes For Early Cross-Straits Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Tang Shubei, vice-president
of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS), told a press conference here today that the problems of
contacts between his organization and Taiwan's Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) can be easily solved if the Taiwan authorities
would agree to political negotiations.
</P>
<P>
It was this disparity that led to the failure of talks between
ARATS and SEF on practical matters, and that there should be a way
to discuss political differences, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that political negotiations need not be based on
Taiwan's recognizing the government of the People's Republic of
China as China's central government, and that the main thing to
overcome is whether the Taiwan authorities make a commitment to
the fact that there is only one China and that Taiwan is a part of
China.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on ending the state of hostilities
between the two sides, Tang said that the mainland has always
advocated negotiations as a means to end this impasse.
</P>
<P>
If Taiwan would not conduct separatist activities and foreign
forces would not interfere in China's reunification process, there
would be no possibility of solving the Taiwan issue by force, he
said.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton has directed his pollsters to find out how
much the Monica Lewinsky controversy has damaged his standing with
the American people, while political advisers urged him anew
Sunday to appear in public Monday to repeat denials of a sexual
relationship with the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
-- Investigators working for prosecutor Kenneth W. Starr
searched aggressively Sunday for any independent evidence that
President Clinton had a sexual relationship with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky and then urged her to lie about it.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton stood before a teleprompter Sunday
afternoon in a brown suit and green vest, practicing his State of
the Union Message in the White House map room with a Roosevelt-era
chart of the allied forces as his backdrop.
</P>
<P>
-- The United States and Britain are laying plans for a
three-or four-day bombing campaign of Iraqi targets as early as
mid-February if President Sadam Hussein continues to block the
work of United Nations weapons inspectors, according to senior
American officials and Western diplomats.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. has begun an intensive round of diplomacy over
Iraq's refusal to give U.N. arms inspectors access to Saddam
Hussein's many places, and is again considering military action.
Baghdad accuses Washington of planning attacks to divert attention
from the Clinton sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
-- The lawyer for the former White House intern said she would
tell all she knows in return for immunity from prosecution, but an
agreement was proving difficult. The Whitewater prosecutor is
pursuing other avenues, including DNA tests on a dress Lewinsky
wore during an alleged sexual encounter.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Residents Turning to Open Market for Food, Vegetables </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 26 (Xinhua) -- A house maid, who was asked to
buy 2.5 kg of citrus with 10 yuan (1.2 US dollars), bought the
amount with only half the money she was given at an open farm
produce market at Gao'an Street.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that residents of Shanghai, China's leading
metropolis, spend a per capita 5.44 yuan on open markets where
they have easy accesses to ample supplies with cheap yet
competitive prices.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the transaction of food grain, edible oil, meat, egg,
aquatics, vegetables, fresh fruit and nuts in Shanghai reached
2.59 million tons, up 23.5 percent over the figure for the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Last year, per-capita consumption of aquatics in Shanghai
reached 280.78 yuan, a rise of 17.17 percent; that of egg,
poultry meat was 355.76 yuan, up 14.03 percent; that of fruit
was 50 kg, which was also much higher than the preceding years.
</P>
<P>
Since China reaped good grain harvests over the past two
consecutive years, farmers across the country flock to Shanghai to
sell their grain and other sideline produce, which resulted in the
abundant supplies on the markets.

<HEADLINE> New Senate President Installed in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Senator Ernesto
Maceda formally bid goodbye to the Senate presidency on Monday,
giving way to the election of Senator Neptali Gonzales to the
position.
</P>
<P>
Maceda's resignation averted the filing of a resolution calling
for his ouster, practically saving him from the humiliation of
being forcibly booted out of the office.
</P>
<P>
At least 16 members of the 24-seat Senate last week decided to
oust Maceda after he failed to remain as chairman of the United
Opposition in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Maceda announced his withdrawal from the opposition coalition
after it chose Vice President Joseph Estrada and senator Edgardo
Angara as its presidential and vice presidential bets for the May
11 elections.
</P>
<P>
Tracing the cause of his standing down, Maceda reiterated that
he would not "cling to any position at a sacrifice of my
principles and conviction."
</P>
<P>
In his farewell speech, Maceda said he was happy that Gonzales
himself would end his term as Senate President later this year.
</P>
<P>
Gonzales, who is now on his second and last term in the Senate,
is expected to bow out of the public office on June 30.
</P>
<P>
It was the third time that Gonzales ascended to the presidency.
He was last ousted in October 1996 by Maceda and some other
senators.
</P>
<P>
Gonzales said the re-organization of the Senate will not delay
the passage of urgent bills and called on his colleagues to try
their best to enact the few bills pending in the chamber.

<HEADLINE> Berasategui Beats Agassi to Enter Final Eight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Spaniard Alberto Berasategui
was rewarded for persistence and patience in Melbourne Monday
night when he beat Andre Agassi in a five-set fourth-round match
at the Australian tennis open.
</P>
<P>
Berasategui came back from two sets down to win the intense
match 3-6 3-6 6-2 6-3 6-3.
</P>
<P>
He will now meet Chilean ninth seed Carlos Moya in the
quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
The absorbing match, which featured tough contests for most of
the games, was played before a record crowd of 14,990.
</P>
<P>
The outstanding win followed Berasategui's excellent effort on
Saturday night, when he dispatched Australian second seed Pat
Rafter in four sets.
</P>
<P>
Agassi jumped Berasategui at the start, breaking his serve in
the opening game of the match and going on to take the set.
</P>
<P>
The former world No.1 continued his dominance in the second
set, although Berasategui had a break-back point at 3-5 down.
</P>
<P>
But much to the Spaniard's dismay, his forehand was called wide
and Agassi swept past him to win the second.
</P>
<P>
Yet Berasategui was playing good tennis, despite the score, and
his hard work paid off in the third.
</P>
<P>
He broke Agassi in the sixth game and again in the eighth to
stay in the match.
</P>
<P>
Agassi had two break points in the first game of the fourth
set, but Berasategui kept his cool to hold serve.
</P>
<P>
Agassi broke him in the fifth game, but Berasategui surged past
him with breaks in the sixth and eighth games.
</P>
<P>
Trailling 3-5, Agassi had a break point at 30-40, only for the
Spaniard to again hold sway and then ace him for the set.
</P>
<P>
Berasategui clearly had the upper hand by now and broke his
flamboyant opponent in the third game of the deciding set.
</P>
<P>
Agassi broke back for two-all, but he again failed to hold
serve and Berasategui was in charge at 3-2.
</P>
<P>
The Spaniard then broke him again in the ninth game for the
match.

<HEADLINE> WTO TELECOMS Deal to Take Effect on February 5 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- An agreement to liberalize
international trade in basic telecommunications services will come
into effect on February 5, the World Trade Organization (WTO)
announced here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement concluded among 69 WTO members in February 1997
should have taken effect on January 1, 1998 if some dozen
participants had ratified it in time.
</P>
<P>
With three more members have joined later, the 72 WTO members,
which have agreed to open their domestic markets to foreign
companies, account for nearly 93 percent of the total domestic and
international revenue of 600 billion U.S. dollars generated in
this sector annually.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, 13 members have not yet accepted the protocol to
implement the agreement, but the rest have agreed to implement the
agreement on February 5, 1998 after the United States and Japan
urged its implementation this morning in a meeting at WTO
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Services covered by the WTO TELECOMS agreement include voice

<HEADLINE> No Panic for Earthquake Rumor, Says SSB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- China's State Seismology Bureau
(SSB) today denied a recent rumor about the possibility of a
strong earthquake in Beijing during the country's traditional
Spring Festival holiday which falls on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After having examined earthquake data for North China area
and their previous observations, SSB seismologists say that an
earthquake measuring more than 5 on the Richter Scale is unlikely
to occur during the Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
According to the SSB's information office, no prediction for a
major earthquake has been made by any official seismology office
or institute.
</P>
<P>
In the recent aftermath of the strong earthquake that hit the
area around Zhangjiakou, a city 220 km to the northwest of
Beijing, the residents of the Chinese capital have begun to pay a
lot more attention to the earthquake situation in North China, and
rumors about a strong earthquake have been quite common.
</P>
<P>
Seismologists say that, although in the past year or two the
North China area has seen more small or moderate tremors, there
will be no stronger earthquake in the near future in the Beijing
area because the recent Zhangjiakou earthquake released a great
amount of energy.
</P>
<P>
They added, however, that they "will continue to monitor the
earthquake situation closely day and night, and hope the people of
Beijing can relax and enjoy their Spring Festival as usual."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Addresses Cross-Straits Relations Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Chen Yunlin, director of the
State Council and Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China's Taiwan affairs office, said here today that political
negotiations across the Taiwan Straits can begin at any time if
Taiwan authorities show sincerity and agree.
</P>
<P>
He told a symposium to mark the Third Anniversary of Jiang
Zemin's Eight-Point Proposition on the Taiwan Issue that his
office can authorize the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits (ARATS) to conduct political negotiations at any
time if Taiwan authorities agree.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, they hope the Taiwan authorities do not go
against the tide of the history and earnestly respond to the
suggestions and proposals.
</P>
<P>
The "peaceful reunification and one country, two systems"
principle and Jiang's eight-point proposal will still be applied
in the new year, and any move to separate China will be firmly
opposed, he underlined.
</P>
<P>
For the sake of common prosperity, the Chinese government will
continue to further improve policies and measures to protect the
interests of Taiwanese investors, and to increase economic and
trade exchanges between the two sides, and ties with each party
and people in Taiwan, except for a few people who stubbornly
insist on 'Taiwan independence', he said. They are welcome to
exchange views on peaceful reunification, to jointly promote
cross-straits relations, Chen said.

<HEADLINE> Pierce to Meet Hingis in Quarterfinal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- French 5th seed Mary Pierce
will takes on reigning champion and world No.1 Martina Hingis in
the quarter final after her second whitewash win Monday in
Melbourne at the Australian Tennis Open.
</P>
<P>
Pierce, the 1995 Australian champion, took just 46 minutes to
despatch Slovakian Henrieta Nagyova 6-0, 6-0 in their fourth-round
match.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after her victory, Pierce declared Monday that she was
at the peak of her career.
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm at the best of my career right now...everything is
coming together - the physical, mental (and) technical," Pierce
said.
</P>
<P>
Monday's whitewash followed her first-round 6-0, 6-0 win over
China's Li Fang.
</P>
<P>
Hingis beat Pierce 6-2, 6-2 in last year's Australian Open
final, but the tall Frenchwoman has a 4-2 head-to-head record
against the Swiss star.
</P>
<P>
Pierce beat Hingis 6-3, 2-6, 7-5 in their last meeting, the
quarter-finals of the November WTA Championships.
</P>
<P>
Pierce has no illusions about how tough Hingis will be to beat.
</P>
<P>
"I guess, head to head, I'm ahead," she said.
</P>
<P>
"But that really doesn't mean anything, because in tennis you
never know what can happen, and each match is different."
</P>
<P>
Hingis notched scored her first whitewash earlier on Monday as
a professional, with the unfortunate Indonesian Yayuk Basuki on
the receiving end of a 6-0, 6-0 whipping.

<HEADLINE> Bahrain Active in Inter-Gulf Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Bahrain, the smallest member
of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), has been found to be the
most active in inter-GCC trade, while others lag far behind, said
an economic study available here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The latest study by United Arab Emirates' Dubai chamber of
commerce and industry said in 1997, up to 26 percent of Bahrain's
trade was with other GCC states. It was followed by Oman with 13
percent and Qatar with 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The lowest rates were in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait with 4
percent. The UAE's rate stood at 6 percent, the study said.
</P>
<P>
It gave no detailed figures, but it said these rates reflected
the strong connection between the diversity of Gulf economies and
GCC states' dependence on oil.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain has encouraged inter-GCC trade because it has the most
diversified economies and is the least reliant on oil revenues
while those seriously dependent on oil recorded the lowest rate,
the study said.
</P>
<P>
Inter-GCC trade, with an average of only 4 percent of the
members' total trade in 1980-1982 has been increased to 9 percent
in 1997. However, the figure remains much lower than rates in
other similar economic blocs whose internal trade ranges between
30 to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The GCC is a 17-year-old economic, political and defense
alliance formed by six Gulf Arab states which groups Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, the UAE, Bahrain, Oman and Qatar.

<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- China's Public Security
Ministry said today that a record 2.56 million Chinese went abroad
in 1997, an increase of 7 percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
Of that number, 878,000 got permits to visit Hong Kong, Macao
and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The majority of these travellers, or 1.065 million, were

<HEADLINE> New Governor In Northeastern China Says Region Will Prosper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Guoguang, who was
elected governor of Liaoning Province in northeastern China, said
here today that there is a great hope for development in spite of
some present difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The 53-year-old Zhang is a graduate of the Beijing Aeronautics
Institute and has been a worker, technician and Party secretary in
Shenyang, Liaoning's capital.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning is one of China's old industrial bases and contributed
to its economic growth from the 1950s to the '80s. But in recent
years, as the planned economy has shifted to a market economy,
Liaoning has faced some major problems. About 50 percent of its
large and medium-sized enterprises are losing money.
</P>
<P>
Zhang cited the job of restructuring Liaoning's state-owned
enterprises as a big one but said he believes that Liaoning will
overcome its difficulties, and the Chinese government places a
great deal of importance in the restructuring job.
</P>
<P>
When asked about his new post, Zhang said the election results
reflected the people's trust in him, and that solving the problems
is a glorious task for his new government and that he is confident
in the province's future.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Approves Government Task Program for 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 26 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin on
Monday approved a 12-task program that calls for economic
reforms, Russia's accession to the World Trade Organization and
more contacts with the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Before meeting with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, Yeltsin
said, "This is a new form of work," and "there is a goal envisaged
in every task we have set forth for 1998 and the number of
officials responsible for its implementation."
</P>
<P>
The program calls for land reform, reduced taxes and an end to
wage arrears, increased investment and stronger legal safeguards
for both citizens and companies.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said the new program would introduce more personal
responsibility for his ministers.
</P>
<P>
"Now no one can evade responsibility because the document sets
it down clearly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin did not say what would happen if the plan is not
realized, but noted that officials "would be called to account,
and it would be tough."
</P>
<P>
First Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov told reporters that
officials would face punishments ranging from a "strong reprimand
to full dismissal." Yeltsin was determined to achieve an economic
breakthrough in 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
Other tasks listed in the program included targeting of welfare
benefits to the needy, reduction of rates charged by monopolies in
the energy and transport sectors, debt payment to the defense
sector and housing for officers expected to retire as part of
military reform.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax news agency, Yeltsin said he already
has signed the plan, which takes effect Monday.

<HEADLINE> WHO to Cooperate with Company on Elephantiasis Elimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- A global health-care company has
agreed to provide its drug product, albendazole, free of charge to
the World Health Organization (WHO) for the elimination worldwide
of the disease called elephantiasis, WHO announced here Monday.
</P>
<P>
A memorandum of understanding has been signed by SmithKline
Beecham PLC (SB) and WHO.
</P>
<P>
Over 1 billion people in 73 countries, or nearly one-fifth of
the world's population, are at risk of contracting elephantiasis,
one of the major causes of individual disability. Over 120 million
people are already infected.
</P>
<P>
New research has determined that albendazole is 99 percent
effective against elephantiasis, which is often spread by
mosquitos and disfigures a person's arms, legs and genital organs.
</P>
<P>
"This will be one of the largest global disease elimination
programs ever undertaken by public health authorities," WHO
Director-General Hiroshi Nakajima said.
</P>
<P>
"We are delighted that SmithKline Beecham has generously agreed to
collaborate with WHO and its Division of Control of Tropical Diseases
in this important initiative," Nakajima added.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that it will take approximately 20 years to
eliminate the disease.
</P>
<P>
SB has promised to continue donating albendazole until the
disease is eliminated.

LONDON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Britain's 97-year-old Queen
Mother is resting comfortably after a successful emergency hip
replacement operation, Buckingham Palace said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The palace said the mother of reigning monarch Queen Elizabeth
had "passed a comfortable night" at London's Edward VII hospital
following the operation.
</P>
<P>
The surgery took place last night after she broke her hip in a
fall at the royal family's rural Sandringham estate in eastern
England while watching horses with her friends on the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The surgeon who operated on her, Harley Street specialist
Roger Vickers, performed a similar operation on her other hip in
1995.
</P>
<P>
The palace said because of the seriousness of the operation,
she would not be receiving any visitors for the next 24 hours. No
further medical bulletins were expected until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Queen Mother was born as Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, the daughter
of a Scottish earl, on August 4, 1900. She was the wife of King
George VI and earned praise for remaining in London throughout the
German bombing campaigns during World War II.

<HEADLINE> 2 Terror Suspects Arrested in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli security forces have
arrested two Palestinians suspected of planning to carry out
terrorist attacks in Jerusalem, Israel Radio reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the two Palestinians were detained while
they were found to try to transport explosives to the city by
their cars. But it did not say when they were arrested.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem police chief Yair Yitzhaki said last week that
Israeli security forces had received intelligence information
regarding terrorists who had stockpiled weapons and were planning
to carry out attacks during the next few days.
</P>
<P>
But the report quoted Palestinian sources as saying that
the arrest of the two Palestinians was made following
information provided by the security forces of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
They noted that the arrest of the suspected terrorists is a
proof of the security cooperation between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security forces have been maintaining a state of alert
against possible terror attacks as Hamas leader Ahmed Yassin
called for a holy war against Israel last week.
</P>
<P>
Yassin, the founder and spiritual leader of the fundamentalist
Hamas movement, called on all the Palestinians to unite in an
armed struggle against Israel, charging this was the only way left
to the Palestinians to gain their rights and achieve their goals.
</P>
<P>
As a response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
Sunday that Israel will react firmly if the Palestinians resort to
violence or threaten violence.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also insisted that the PNA could do much more to
fight terrorism. He said that the ongoing terror threat requires
Israeli efforts to curb all the possible terror attempts.

<HEADLINE> "Nairobi Fly" Annoys Kenyans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The so-called Nairobi Fly, a
lurid orange-and-black beetle, has captivated at least hundreds
of Kenyans and sent alarm bells nationwide in the eastern African
country since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the situation was eased slightly following four days
without rains and the warnings given by the Kenyan health
authority, local health sources told Xinhua on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The beetles, identified as paederus crebinpunctatis and
paederus sabaeus, do not sting or bite. But once their antlike
body is crushed, potent toxins spill onto the skin causing
itching, a burning sensation and swelling.
</P>
<P>
Most painful is "Nairobi Eye." When the poison is smeared in
the eye, the eye becomes swollen, red and oozy. Temporary
blindness can occur.
</P>
<P>
Like most insects, the beetles are attracted by bright lights.
When the lights are switched off, the beetles drop off bulbs and
fluorescent tubes to return to the soil.
</P>
<P>
The beetles are always resident in Kenya and much of the rest
of the world. But this year, its population exploded in Kenya
because of unusually heavy rains brought by the El Nino weather
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
They breed in wet, rotting leaves and soil. The rainfall 500
percent above normal which began in last October has greatly
lengthened the breeding season, causing their numbers to soar,
John Ouma, a Health Ministry entomologist, was quoted by the East
African Standard newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
"This is the worst I've ever seen," he said. The bugs have
invaded houses, offices and schools in Nairobi and elsewhere in
Kenya, especially parts of the Rift Valley and Central provinces.
</P>
<P>
Previous outbreaks have been reported on every continent
except North America, in countries including Uganda, India,
Japan, Israel and Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, a beetle falls onto a person who naturally takes a
swat at the tickling intruder. In death, the bug retaliates--
releasing pederin, one of the most powerful animal toxins it
produces to keep from being eaten.
</P>
<P>
Then, 12 to 24 hours later, the skin where the beetle was
crushed flushes red. Victims complain of symptoms from tickling
to severe burning.
</P>
<P>
In another day or two, pinhead-sized blisters erupt, filled
with a yellowish fluid. It takes about three weeks for the
victims to fully recover from the suffering.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) has agreed to grant 775,000 U.S. dollars to Nepal in
technical assistance to help improve Nepal's road transport, the
bank said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The assistance will prepare the Fourth Road Improvement Project
for possible bank financing, the ADB said in a press release
available here.
</P>
<P>
The project will focus on maintenance, rehabilitation and
improvement of up to 500 km of the Core Road Network, construction
of approximately 230 km of district headquarters access roads in
the Strategic Road Network and private sector investment
opportunities to improve access in the Kathmandu area, it said.
</P>
<P>
These road sections are within the Nepali government's Priority
Investment Plan for the sector.
</P>
<P>
While there has been a substantial expansion of the country's
road network over the years, there has been lack of sustained
maintenance of the existing roads, the ADB said.
</P>
<P>
Road transport in Nepal is vital to reducing isolation and
distributing economic development to remote areas, it said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank will offer fund
to Ugandan farmers to develop their business directly instead of
through authorities, The New Vision reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Baner, senior adviser on agriculture to the

This is the Kokoshin's fourth visit to China.

the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at
the core.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Qian Qichen told a
seminar here today for the third anniversary of an important
speech by President Jiang Zemin that political negotiations
between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits is the key to
improving relations.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan authorities are expected to be sincere and to give a
conscientious, active, and explicit response, he added,
emphasizing that the "one China" principle must be adhered to, and
that there is only one China in the world, that Taiwan is a part
of China, and that China's sovereignty and territorial integrity
cannot be set apart.
</P>
<P>
Putting an end to the state of hostilities between the two sides
is the wish of Taiwan compatriots and embodies thoughts of
peaceful reunification by seeking truth from facts, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
The most important thing is that the topics, participants, and
means of political negotiations be decided and accepted by both
sides, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
The Association for the Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS), which is on the mainland, and the Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) on Taiwan should increase exchanges to reach a
consensus, he said.
</P>
<P>
The mainland is ready to increase contacts and exchange views
with various parties and people in Taiwan, he said, referring to
the development of cross-Straits relations as 'irresistible', and
said the Taiwan question will be resolved in the end.
</P>
<P>
Li Lanqing, a member of Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and Chi Haotian and Jia
Qinglin, who are Political Bureau members of the CPC Central
Committee, were present.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of China's non-Communist parties and people's
organizations attended the seminar, and said that the Taiwan

<HEADLINE> Israel's 1997 Overseas Investments Down by 11 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Israel's overseas investments
fell by about 11 percent in 1997, local daily The Jerusalem Post
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The investments in 1997 dropped to 887 million U.S. dollars
from 993 million dollars in 1996, the controller of foreign
exchange at the Bank of Israel was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The controller attributed the decline of the investments to
that of chemical and oil sectors from 512 million dollars in 1996
to 49 million dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Of the total investments, about two-thirds were made by
industrial companies. The electronics and communication sector
took the lead with a total investment of 243 million dollars, 13
million dollars more than that in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The investments in real estate last year increased to 165
million dollars from 120 million dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The controller said that last year's overseas investments of
Israel were mainly made in raising stakes of existing companies,
setting up new firms, granting loans, in real estate and improving
marketing channels.
</P>
<P>
About 420 million dollars were invested in the United States
last year. The investments in Far East countries was a mere 5
million dollars. And a large part was made in Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
During the previous four years, Israel has a total of 3.2
billion dollars overseas direct investment.

<HEADLINE> Security Deteriorates in Somali Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Security situation in the
Somali capital is deteriorating when the Mogadishu citizens are
expecting a lasting solution to the political crisis following
the recent agreement by the main warlords in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Four people were killed and one more was wounded when
unidentified gunmen opened fire on a car near Bar Ubah junction
of South Mogadishu late Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said a group of gunmen on a battle wagon with a
heavy anti-aircraft machine gun mounted on it opened fire on a
taxi transporting five men, killing three of them on the spot and
wounding two others. One of the wounded later died of his wounds
at a treatment center in South Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Businessmen in their stalls where the incident took place also
took up arms and opened fire on the perpetrators in an attempt to
defend the unarmed civilians.
</P>
<P>
Other individuals rushed to the scene and fired upon the
battle wagon which sped away as the shooting increased. No one
knows whether any of the occupants of the battle wagon was hurt.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the attack is not known. However, the
eyewitnesses said passengers in the taxi were carrying with them
a plastic bag full of money and that the gunmen were probably
after the money.
</P>
<P>
Other sources said there has been an earlier dispute between
the victims and their assailants over the rentals of a lorry
leaving for the central regions.
</P>
<P>
Looting and killing innocent civilians has been popular in
Mogadishu in recent days. Two days ago, a lorry driver was shot
dead and his lorry looted near Al-Baraka junction of South
Mogadishu by unidentified gunmen. The driver had just off-loaded
banana stock at a store in a nearby market.
</P>
<P>
In North Mogadishu, all public transport buses quit operating
for two days following a spree of looting particularly on
mini-buses that cross to South Mogadishu. Several road blocks
have been erected by freelance gunmen in many places where
extortion money is collected from the buses.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, by Sunday afternoon, large number of sweating
pedestrians were seen going in streams on the main roads of North
Mogadishu before elders intervened the situation and restored
some public transport buses on some of the roads.
</P>
<P>
Despite the looting and killing exercises, joint extensive
meetings continue in both sides of the capital for the reception
of Hussein Mohamed Aidid and Osman Ali Atto's delegations due to
arrive in the following days.
</P>
<P>
North Mogadishu faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed is keeping a
low profile as his counterparts keep postponing their arrivals.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, as the 8th year for Somalia's chaos unfolds,
many people express concern over the increasing insecurity in the
capital although faction leaders have pledged to open Mogadishu's
main installations, such as the air and seaports, and restore the
order of law in the capital in their latest meeting in Cairo.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak's Advisor on Arab-Israeli Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Presidential Political
Adviser Osama Al Baz has described the Arab-Israeli conflict as
"one of rights and not of borders or existence," the Middle East
News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a lecture at a symposium organized by Helwan University
Sunday night, Baz said the decades-old conflicts between Arabs and
Israelis will end up sooner or later with signing of peace
agreements.
</P>
<P>
In the lecture entitled "Future Vision of Egypt's Foreign
Policy," Baz criticized the United States for its policy on
maintaining an Israeli military supremacy. He said this policy is
"abnormal and incomprehensible."
</P>
<P>
"This policy causes imbalance in the region," he said, urging
the U.S. government to change its attitude.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt's interests are identical to the Arab ones and Egypt
will never accept that its relations with Israel harm either its
national interests or those of the Arab countries," he said,
adding that any Arab future vision should be based on achieving an
Arab common market.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli peace talks with Syria and Lebanon have stranded
since January 1996 after a wave of suicide bombings in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have deadlocked since last
March after Israel started building a new settlement in Arab East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The recent summit meetings in Washington between U.S. President
Bill Clinton and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat have failed to break the ice.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Jordan are the only two Arab countries that have
signed peace treaties with Israel, and have worked to bridge the
gaps between the Palestinians and Israelis after the crisis
erupted.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Encourages Overseas Investment in Agricultural Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin, the largest port city
in north China, will attach more importance to the use of
investment from overseas in agricultural sector this year.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from a recent municipal meeting on use of
overseas investment, the municipal government has selected 40 or
so major agricultural projects for overseas investors, involving
breeding, horticulture, vegetable growing, and the processing of
farm and sideline produce, dairy products, and meat products.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin is the largest and oldest industrial city in north
China and previously, its manufacturing industries had been the
focus for the use of overseas funds in the city.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shuzu, director of the Tianjin Municipal Commission of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, said that the growth of
highly-efficient agriculture has become one of the municipal
government's tasks because Tianjin has five counties and four
suburban districts with a rural population of several millions and
the municipal government has become aware of the importance of
developed agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin will capitalize on the advantages of development parks
in its suburban counties and districts and introduce
export-oriented farming and sideline production projects featuring
high technological and value-added contents through the use of
overseas investment, the director said.
</P>
<P>
It has been implementing a scheme of setting up 12 high-tech
development demonstration zones, fostering six series of farm and
sideline produce for export, and opening a center for importing
and absorbing improved varieties of farm crops, technologies and
equipment from abroad.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the city has launched a group of high value-added,
export-oriented agricultural projects and formed bases for such
products as beef and meat chickens. It now earns 100 million
U.S. dollars from export of such agricultural products a year.
</P>
<P>
The city used overseas investment in some 100 agricultural
projects last year, with the agreed sum of overseas investment
amounting to 7.64 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Parliament to Reconvene Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The disbanded Sierra Leonean
parliament may soon reconvene as a prelude to reinstating ousted
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah in April, the Guardian reported on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
About 40 parliamentarians in the ousted Kabbah government met
at the weekend and agreed to restart their law-making function,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The first post-coup meeting of the 80-member parliament,
dissolved after the May 25 coup, was held in Lungi on the
outskirts of the capital Freetown, where the west African
peacekeeping force (ECOMOG) is based.
</P>
<P>
The meeting called on the remaining 40 parliamentarians who
are said to have travelled to Europe and America following the
coup to join their colleagues in Lungi at a date to be announced
later.
</P>
<P>
Ousted President Kabbah on Sunday confirmed the envisaged
re-grouping of the parliamentarians, saying that accommodation
and other logistic support will be provided to facilitate the
work of the parliamentarians.
</P>
<P>
Under a peace accord, the ruling military junta in Freetown is
to hand over power to Kabbah's government on April 22 this year.
</P>
<P>
But junta leader Johnny Paul Koroma later dismissed the date
as unrealistic due to ECOMOG's inability to start disarmament of
combatants in Sierra Leone and the delay of international relief
goods, which are two key elements in the handover agenda.
</P>
<P>
However, west African countries and the United Nations, both
imposed sanctions and arms embargo on the junta, have announced
that the accord should be followed strictly.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG is mandated to carry out the international sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Books Emerge as Popular New Year's Gifts in Yunnan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Books are the gift of choice
for children on this year's Lunar New Year's Eve in Kunming,
southwest China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
According to a middle-aged man who spent more than 2,000 yuan
(240 US dollars) on books. "My relatives have a number of
children. I consider books to be the best New Year's gifts for
them."
</P>
<P>
Elder Chinese have traditionally presented red paper envelopes
containing cash to children on Spring Festival Eve.
</P>
<P>
This year's Spring Festival begins on January 28.
</P>
<P>
"Children would use the money to buy firecrackers or play
electronic games in the past," said an elderly woman who was
taking her grandson on her arms and clutching a bag of books on
the other hand.
</P>
<P>
"I no longer worry that the children will misuse the money,"
said the woman. "The books will help my grandchildren."

<HEADLINE> Howard Hopes Republic Would Keep Australian Character </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister John Howard
said Monday he hoped the Australian character would not change if
the nation eventually became a republic.
</P>
<P>
In remarks to celebrate Australia Day, Howard said that
although the symbols of the nation were changing, its character
was its strength, according to the Australian Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
"A nation has symbols and a nation also has its substance and I
think both things are important but the substance of a nation, the
character of a nation, and what a nation stands for is even more
important than its symbols," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview on Sunday, Howard warned he would not stand by
and watch if the Constitutional Convention, due in February, chose
to destroy the current system by seeking a directly-elected
president.
</P>
<P>
He refused to rule out campaigning against a directly-elected
president. "I am not going to remain silent either now or in the
months ahead if I believe that we are moving towards a system that
will fundamentally undermine the stability of our present
approach."
</P>
<P>
However, he vowed to fulfill his election promise for the
Australian people to have a say on whether the nation should
become a republic. "There is no way I will stop the Australian
people from deciding this issue, because it's their issue to
decide."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Opposition leader Kim Beazley called for debate on
the issue. "We've got to move the republic on," he told reporters
in Perth.
</P>
<P>
"Above all, we are a people who can provide our own head of
state, so we've got to move that agenda on for the next few
weeks".
</P>
<P>
Asked about Howard's opposition to a popularly-elected head of
state, Beazley said the prime minister found it hard to accept
that a republic would diminish his power.
</P>
<P>
He said the current system of the prime minister recommending
to the Queen who should be the next governor-general put prime
ministers "in the saddle" and in control of events.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever happens in relation to the republic, whether it's an
elected president, whether it's a president appointed by
parliament, or even by a panel, there is some diminution of the
prime minister's authority," he said.

<HEADLINE> Lower HIV/AIDS Cases Reported in Philippines in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
on Monday that its years of anti-AIDS efforts seemed to be paying
off as the Department of Health reported lower Human
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infections for 1997.
</P>
<P>
The health department said a total of 117 HIV cases were
reported last year, compared with 156 recorded in 1996.
</P>
<P>
HIV is the virus which can cause Acquired Immunodeficiency
Syndrome (AIDS).
</P>
<P>
Of the reported HIV infections last year, the department said
97 percent or 114 cases reported sex as the primary mode of
transmission.
</P>
<P>
Almost 70 percent of those infected with the AIDS-causing virus
in 1997 belong to the age group of 19 to 39 years old.
</P>
<P>
"Years of intervention, particularly focused on commercial sex
workers, men having sex with men, overseas contract workers and
the general public, are now paying off," Health Secretary
Carmencita Reodica said.
</P>
<P>
Reodica, however, said the drop in reported HIV/AIDS cases
should not make them complacent in their anti-AIDS efforts. "There
are still a lot to be done, particularly in curbing the increasing
cases of sexually transmitted diseases."
</P>
<P>
The country's cumulative HIV/AIDS cases since 1984 is now 978,
of whom 172 have died of the killer disease.

Renong Bhd was the most actively traded counter as it
registered a turnover of 14.11 million units. It was followed by

<P>
HONG KONG, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Administrative Secretary of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Anson Chan Fang
On-sang returned here Monday from a 16-day trip to the United
States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
Meeting reporters at the airport, Chan said that this trip was
well worthwhile because the most talked about issue was the Asian
financial turmoil and how this has affected or not affected Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, all political leaders and the business chief
executive officials whom I met were, first of all, greatly
encouraged by how smoothly the whole transition (Hong Kong's
return to China) has gone and encouraged also by Chinese leaders'
adherence to the (Sino-British) Joint Declaration and the Basic
Law," Chan said.
</P>
<P>
She said: "It has also given me a very clear message and that
is that in looking at how Hong Kong has fared in this financial
turmoil compared with many other Asian economies, we are generally
regarded as being somewhat more stable, the Hong Kong dollar has
remained firmed, the government has in place prudent fiscal
policies which I have assured them we are not going to change and
we have a good prudential supervision of the financial sector,
particularly the banking sector."
</P>
<P>
That is of course crucially important in maintaining
international investors' confidence in Hong Kong, she emphasized,
noting that "we will not depart from our prudent fiscal management
policies."

<HEADLINE> India, France to Enhance All-Round Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 26 (Xinhua) -- India and France have decided
to enhance their all-round relations and cooperation, especially
in economic and trade fields.
</P>
<P>
In their two rounds of talks here on Sunday, Indian Prime
Minister Inder Kumar Gujral and visiting French President Jacques
Chirac agreed on an all-round expansion of bilateral relations
that would later help them to sew up specific projects in various
fields.
</P>
<P>
They include space, defense, nuclear energy for civilian use,
aeronautics, urban equipment and transport, oil exploration,
environment, trade, economic and investment.
</P>
<P>
Chirac, who arrived in India on Saturday on a three-day state
visit, said upon arrival that France had made a rapprochement with
Asia, and India in particular, one of the priorities of his
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
"At the heart of new Europe, there is France, which wants to
establish a new, more ambitious, broader economic relationship
with India," he told Indian industrialists in Mumbai, the biggest
commercial city of India.
</P>
<P>
During Chirac's visit, India and France signed four cooperation
agreements.
</P>
<P>
India's Tata electric company and French energy major "Total"
signed an agreement to develop and jointly operate energy related
projects in India. French financial services major CCF (Credit
Commercial de France) signed a deal with India's Tamilnadu
Industrial Development Corporation and Infrastructure Leasing and
Financial Services Limited to develop India's road sector.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> New Drug Technique Found to Keep Arteries Unclogged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Israel's researchers have
developed a new drug-delivery technique that prevents clogged
coronary arteries opened up by angioplasty from shutting down
again, The Jerusalem Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the researchers have proved their method
on animals and hope to apply the method in clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
In angioplasty, a tiny balloon is inflated inside coronary
arteries whose blood circulation is blocked by layers of
plaque. The balloon's pressure causes the fatty buildup to
compress, allowing blood to pass through to the heart muscle.
</P>
<P>
But arterial blockages recur within six months among a third to
a half of angioplasty patients. Until now, there has been no
solution to this problem, which is caused by irritation of the
interior wall of the artery.
</P>
<P>
This irritation stimulates cellular reproduction, resulting in
encrustment and re-narrowing of the passage.
</P>
<P>
A joint research team of the Hebrew University-Hadassah School
of Medicine and Bikur Holim Hospital in Jerusalem found a way to
prevent this process, known as restenosis.
</P>
<P>
And the team is the first in the world to prove that the drug
family called tyrphostins prevents restenosis in the necks of
rodents and in the hips of pigs. These animal experiments hold out
promise that coronary arteries in man will react similarly.
</P>
<P>
The drug is embedded within extremely small, porous, polymer
particles, which are biologically compatible with the blood
vessels and can release the drug slowly into the bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
The drug enters the clogged coronary arteries from the
beginning of the initial angioplasty treatment, and it is
effective -- through controlled release -- throughout the time
needed for healing the injury caused by angioplasty.
</P>
<P>
This adds not only to a more successful angioplasty, but also
prevents side effects harmful to healthy tissues, since the drug
is administered at the right concentration and solely to the
affected area.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Parliament Approves Election Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's National
Assembly, or parliament, Monday approved nominations for a
commission in charge of monitoring the July 26 general elections.
</P>
<P>
Second Prime Minister Hun Sen welcomed the assembly's vote --
70 for, 15 against with three members abstaining -- in favor of
nominating the 11-member National Election Commission (NEC).
</P>
<P>
"The elections will be held as scheduled because the NEC has
already been set up ... and I hope the elections will be free and
fair," Hun Sen told reporters outside the assembly hall.
</P>
<P>
The NEC has the mandate to oversee all aspects of the
elections, including the registration of voters, political parties
and candidates, as well as verifying the fairness of the process.
</P>
<P>
Chheng Phon, who served as minister of culture and also of
information during the 1980s, will chair the NEC.
</P>
<P>
Of the commission's members, one will be from each of the four
parties represented in the assembly, two from the Ministry of
Interior, one from non-governmental organizations, two as private
citizens and another two as eminent Khmer personalities.
</P>
<P>
The international community has urged the Cambodian government
to secure the NEC's full independence, as some observers
questioned the body's neutrality and called it pro-Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen fired back: "I think the assembly has expressed its
democratic procedure by voting."

<HEADLINE> Prisoners Preparing for Spring Festival (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Despite high walls and
electrified fences which separate prisoners from the outside
world, Tianjin Prison is witnessing the same Spring Festival
atmosphere as the rest of China.
</P>
<P>
The traditional Spring Festival, which begins on January 28,
is the most important holiday for Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The prison, built in 1903 in the latter part of the Ming
Dynasty, houses over 2,000 male and female prisoners, including
foreigners and infamous criminals.
</P>
<P>
In the prison, various types of colored lanterns are seen
hanging in cell-blocks, with red scrolls bearing antithetical
couplets and paper-cuts crafted by prisoners decorating doors and
windows, a traditional Chinese expression for welcoming the Lunar
New Year.
</P>
<P>
The menu for the eve of Spring Festival will include
traditional food such as jiaozi, or meat dumplings, and chicken,
fish and meat dishes normally served on the first day of the
festival.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Warden Yin Yongshi said the prison has allocated over
100,000 yuan (12,000 US dollars) for recreational activities and
purchasing traditional Spring Festival food for prisoners. He also
noted that each prisoner will receive a New Year's gift.
</P>
<P>
"Each prisoner receives 155 yuan (18 dollars) per month to
cover food, medical treatment, education and personal expenses",
according to Yin.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the allowance equals the minimum social guarantee for
ordinary citizens.
</P>
<P>
Each cell is equipped with a heater, colored TV and electric
fan. And prisoners in each cell share two daily newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Prisoners are permitted to watch Spring Festival TV programs
aired by more than a dozen channels, and are allowed to
watch late night programming on Spring Festival Eve.
</P>
<P>
Female prisoner Guo Zhongshuang, who is serving a life
sentence for murder, said the prison has served additional
delicious dishes and arranged recreational activities on each
national holiday during 14 years of her imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Yin Yongshi said prisoners with good records are allowed
conjugal visits during the three-day Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
Yin also pointed out that prisoners serving sentences
for minor crimes are allowed home visits during the festival
period.
</P>
<P>
Yin noted that a special meeting and dinner will be arranged
for prisoners and their family members during this year's Spring
Festival.

<P>
Prisoners refer to each other as "classmates". Zhao Ying, 27, a
female prisoner serving a life sentence for murder, is a
university graduate who became a teacher after her imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said prison is in many ways like a school. She noted that
the prison offers training classes in foreign languages, computers,
painting and various other special subjects.
</P>
<P>
Prisoners can attend courses ranging from the primary school
level to third year university studies.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 prisoners have earned either primary or middle
school graduation certificates. A number of prisoners have also
earned certificates after passing national self-study examinations.
</P>
<P>
Yin noted that about 50 percent of prisoners are farmers and a
large number are illiterate. "Teaching the prisoners rudiments in
reading, writing to let them master various techniques is an
important part of rehabilitation," Yin said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to the fact that many prisoners completing their
prison terms have emerged as useful members of society.
</P>
<P>
December 20, 1997 was a special day for prisoners who retained
their political rights. Said prisoners were allowed to vote for
grass roots deputies to Tianjin's Municipal People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Jing Congxi, one prisoner with the right vote, said "the election
was arranged in strict accordance with the Election Law, and no
one with voting credentials was prohibited from participating."
</P>
<P>
Liu Hongshen, an official with the Tianjin Prison
Administration, said that the law protects prisoners from
infringements on their personal safety and humiliation.
</P>
<P>
Liu said prisoners retain the right to appeal, meet with
family members, write and receive letters, and receive an
education.
</P>
<P>
A Hui prisoner, who was having dinner specially prepared for
members of his ethnic group, said that the religious beliefs of
prisoners are fully respected.
</P>
<P>
Prisoner Guo Zhongshuang said she and her cell-mates work less
than eight hours a day and have weekends free. Labor is, in fact,
considered to be one of the most important factors in the
rehabilitation process.
</P>
<P>
She noted that prisoners are allowed to take a bath twice a day
in summer and once a day in winter. Prisoners receive timely
treatment when feeling sick, and those suffering from serious
diseases are released on bail to undergo hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
Four resident procurators supervise prison operations. The
prison also offers a Warden's letter box and hot line for
prisoners and their families.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that prisoners with good performance have the
opportunity to receive reduced sentences. Guo Zhongshuang earned
three sentence reductions, and Zhao Ying's life imprisonment
sentence was reduced to 17 years.
</P>
<P>
Liu noted that some 25 percent of prisoners earn sentence
reductions for good performance records.
</P>
<P>
The warden noted that a modern prison currently under
construction in the Tianjin suburbs will replace the existing
facility and offer significant improvements.

</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Monicagate is threatening U.S. President Bill Clinton. In
November 1996, the American television captured the image of an
evident complicity between Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky.

<P>
LUSAKA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's Ndola City Council
will lay off 100 workers this week as part of its massive monthly
retrenchment program to off-load 1,100 staff.
</P>
<P>
The council intends to off-load 100 workers every month until
the 2,100 workforce is reduced to 1,000, according to Times of
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted town clerk Emmanuel Chenda as
saying in Ndola on Sunday that the council has secured 250
million Kwacha (about 200,000 U.S. Dollars) for the retrenchment
and noted the affected workers will be spared the agony of
waiting for their dues.
</P>
<P>
"Thereafter we shall resort to engaging contract workers
because it is a cheap arrangement as compared to the recruitment
of permanent staff," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chenda expressed the hope that after restructuring its
workforce, the council will improve its services.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in another northern city of Kitwe, council town
clerk Ali Simwinga said a retrenchment exercise targeting 1,000
employees will start as soon as funds are available.
</P>
<P>
He said the council has written to the government requesting
for funds and is aso trying to raise some money from its own
resources.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Truth Body Awaiting Ex-President's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 26 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (TRC) is awaiting formal correspondence
from former state president P. W. Botha's lawyers to summon TRC
Chairman Desmond Tutu to testify in the case that the TRC filed
against Botha.
</P>
<P>
Weekend reports said Botha's lawyers have summoned Tutu to
appear when the trial of Botha resumes on February 23 on charges
of contempt for the TRC.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the summons warned Tutu that failure to appear
could lead to a 300 Rand fine or a three-month imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
TRC, which laid criminal charges against Botha last month for
ignoring a third subpoena to testify for the former State
Security Council, said Sunday that it was difficult to respond to
media reports.
</P>
<P>
"We have not heard anything from Mr. Botha or his lawyers,
except what we have read in the media," TRC spokesman Phila
Ngqumba was quoted by Monday's Star paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Botha reportedly also requests the TRC to provide him with a
host of transcripts of its hearings, including those of F. W. de
Klerk, Botha's successor, and several former cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
Transcripts are also requested of the TRC's questioning of,
among others, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, ex-wife of President
Nelson Mandela, and Oupa Gqozo, former military ruler of Ciskei,
one of the ten black homelands during the Apartheid.
</P>
<P>
Botha, 82, appeared on Friday in the George Regional Court in
Western Cape Province. After a brief hearing in which documents
were exchanged, the judge adjourned the case until February 23 to
allow all parties access to the documentation.
</P>
<P>
Botha claims he reached an "agreement of cooperation" with
Tutu during a meeting in George Court in November 1996, under
which he would supply the TRC with written answers in exchange
for a guarantee that he would not have to make a personal
appearance.
</P>
<P>
Botha provided the TRC with a reply of about 1,700 pages late
last year and now claims that the TRC is being malicious in
demanding his appearance and charging him for refusing to do so.

<HEADLINE> S. African Arms Producer Plans to Reduce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 26 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's arms
producer, Denel, announced on Sunday that it would shrink its
defense sector within two years to 20 percent of the group's
business.
</P>
<P>
"The company has a very strong balance sheet, which it can now
use actively to start looking at new business acquisitions," said
Seshe Chonco, the newly appointed group managing director.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing that prevents Denel from getting into
telecommunications. There is nothing that prevents Denel from
getting into a blue-chip portfolio," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Chonco noted, Denel would remain pivotal to the
domestic defense industry. He said strong cash generators, like
the group's property portfolio, would be retained to provide
funds for research and development in a limited range of "unique"
or strategic technologies.
</P>
<P>
The domestic defense industry would need to be consolidated in
line with international trends, and Denel would move to
consolidate the fragmented domestic defense industry through the
acquisition of some of its weaker private-sector counterparts,
Chonco added.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Farmers Angered by Diverted Fertilizer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- At least 32,000 bags of
fertilizer meant for farmers in Monze district of Zambia's
Southern Province have been diverted, provoking anger among
farmers in the district, Times of Zambia reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Monza District Development Coordinating
Committee appealed to the Agriculture Ministry to intervene
immediately.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 village head-men from the hunger-stricken
Nachibuli area in Monza have said government leaders should not
take lightly the hunger which is stalking people.
</P>
<P>
District agriculture coordinator Achelly Moomba was quoted as
saying that some top leaders wanted to have the fertilizer for
their company but failed to do so because government only
recognizes the Monze Farmers Union as the legitimate fertilizer
dealer.
</P>
<P>
The government said last year it would give the fertilizer to
cover 80,000 hectares from which 20,000 farmers were supposed to
benefit.
</P>
<P>
One village head-man said they do not understand why other
districts are receiving food every week while Monze is not.
</P>
<P>
He said the people of Monze should be treated equally like
those in other districts and called on their member of parliament
Edgar Keembe to scout for food for starving people.

LUSAKA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Tazama Pipeline will construct
a 40,000 cubic metre oil tank in Ndola, northern Zambia, to
increase the capacity for landed crude oil reserves, Zambia Daily
Mail reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted Robert Kakumbi, public relations
manager of the Zambian-Tanzanian joint corporation, as saying
that the construction of the tank, which will cost 4.5 million
U.S. Dollars, is being funded by the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
"It is meant to improve the operational capacity for landed
oil reserves in Zambia," he said.
</P>
<P>
The construction is expected to start in August this year and
to be completed one year later, the official added.
</P>
<P>
The tank, once constructed, will diminish feed stock shortage
in case of pipeline shut down and other unexpected problems.
</P>
<P>
The 40,000 cubic metre of oil will last four to five weeks.

<HEADLINE> EU, Nigeria to Discuss Sea Food Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The European Union and Nigeria
are expected to begin discussions on modalities for the west
African country to export fish and other sea foods to Europe.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria loses millions U.S. Dollars in foreign exchange due to
inability to export sea foods to Europe, according to the
Fisheries and Trawlers Association of Nigeria (FTAN).
</P>
<P>
FTAN President Olubunmi Elliot blamed the Fisheries and
Trawlers Association of the European Union for its efforts to
always block the struggle of his organization to export sea foods
to Europe, This Day newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
He further attributed the Union's unwillingness to allow
Nigeria's sea foods into Europe to the belief that "Nigeria does
not have the necessary hygienic laboratories for the preservation
of sea foods".
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks at a recent meeting with
Gabriel Osuide, director-general of National Agency for Food and
Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC).
</P>
<P>
Elliot said since laboratories have been put in place to avoid
contamination, the EU Association of Fisheries and Trawlers will
be visiting Nigeria to inspect facilities on the ground.
</P>
<P>
This will be a prelude to giving the nod for Nigeria to export
the commodities to Europe, noted Elliot who was seeking support
and advice from NAFDAC.
</P>
<P>
Noted that FTAN has not conformed with existing rules and
regulations of NAFDAC, Osuide warned that in exporting sea foods
to Europe, they should not bring the nation into disrepute and
embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
He therefore called on the association to ensure that they
adhere to acceptable production practices.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Churches Caution Govt Against State of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Zambian church organizations
have cautioned the government against using the state of
emergency to settle old scores and maintaining it for more than
is necessary.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail published Monday said that three major
church organisations want the ongoing session of parliament to
review the state of emergency declared by President Frederick
Chiluba following the abortive coup last October and establish
whether or not it was serving its publicised purpose to
facilitate investigations into the coup.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique released in Lusaka at the weekend, the
paper said, three influential church organisations -- Chiritaian
Council of Zambia, Evangelical Fellowship of Zambia and Zambia
Episcopal Conference said the state of emergency which is
supposed to be reviewed every three months by the parliament
should not be unnecessarily prolonged.
</P>
<P>
The three bodies which met to review the current political
situation in Zambia, said they were on record as having endorsed
the declaration of the state of emergency with reservations and
would caution the government not to use it to settle old scores.
</P>
<P>
The church leaders also observed that there were prolonged
detentions of political detainees which they said may result in
uncalled for victimization of innocent people.
</P>
<P>
They also stressed that the period of the coup-related
investigations should be considerably short.
</P>
<P>
Some Zambian army soldiers staged a short-lived military coup
in October, 1997 to topple the Chiluba government and Chiluba
declared the state of emergency immediately under which more than
90 people including former president and opposition leader
Kenneth Kaunda have been arrested for alleged involvement in the
coup.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Reiterates Concern Over Cypriot Air Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Turkey stressed its concern over
the establishment of a military air base constructed at Paphos of
Cyprus, local newspaper Daily News reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a senior Turkish Foreign Ministry official
who spoke on condition of anonymity as saying that it seems the
Cypriot government will not give up the plan to put the base into
operation.
</P>
<P>
"From now on, it is up to the military to decide what to do. It
has become a matter of military planning," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot military air base at the western coastal town has
been built under a defense pact signed between Cyprus and Greece
in 1993. It will also be used by Greek air force planes.
</P>
<P>
It was handed over to the National Guard of Cyprus Saturday,
but its formal inauguration will not take place until after the
Cypriot presidential elections due on February 8.
</P>
<P>
Facts have proven that Greece and Cyprus have increasingly
become "a united state" in terms of military and defense, the
Turkish official said.
</P>
<P>
While saying that "some accidents might take place in the
Aegean," the official ruled out the possibility of military
conflicts on the divided island.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has warned that the air base will further complicate the
situations in Cyprus, and that Turkey and Turkish Cypriots will
take measures to counter the threat.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash said earlier that "the
planes which take off from the base at Paphos will not have the
opportunity to land."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops and took over northern third of the Mediterranean
island to protect the Turkish minorities after a failed coup by
Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Enterprises Eyeing Agricultural Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, January 26 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of China's
enterprises have turned to agriculture for more economic growth,
bringing good efficiency not only to themselves, but to farmers as
well.
</P>
<P>
Lush greenery of carnation, cherry, and other vegetables and
fruits in 24 plastic greenhouses in Zhangye City of Hexi Corridor,
northwest China's Gansu Province, is a good example of this effort.
</P>
<P>
The city's No.3 Construction Company introduced dipping
irrigation equipment from Israel and set up the cooperative
agriculture high-tech garden.
</P>
<P>
The company has also opened an orchard, a pig farm, a cattle
and sheep farm, and its production output has begun to increase by
a big margin as a result.
</P>
<P>
Now in Hexi Corridor, which runs 500 km long and covers three
prefectures, more than 100 enterprises have entered the
agricultural sector, local sources said.
</P>
<P>
And 155 farm produce and by-products processing factories have
been established in Zhangye, and these products have added 387
million yuan in annual output only by processing grain and food
oil.
</P>
<P>
Jiuquan city is another example. The city's Supply and
Marketing Group spent 5.8 million yuan developing a 670-ha
production base, where an alcohol factory, a high-protein soft
drink production line, and a 10,000-head livestock farm have begun
to bring profits.
</P>
<P>
Industrial participation in agriculture was said to be partly
responsible for farmers in the area to enjoy 2,300 yuan in per
capita income last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Papua New Guinea (PNG) Prime
Minister Bill Skate has apologized to the people of Bougainville
for "the pain, conflict and suffering" caused by successive
national governments during the nine-year secessionist crisis on
the island, the Australian Associated Press (AAP) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
In an open letter to the people in Bougainville island, Skate
said that the impact of the crisis would be faced by generations
to come.
</P>
<P>
"I acknowledge the role that past and present national
governments, including agencies of the government, have played in
the conflict, the pain and suffering of the people of
Bougainville, and indeed, from other parts of Papua New Guinea,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Skate's apology follows the signing of the agreement in New
Zealand last Friday by the warring parties in the latest round of
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, a permanent ceasefire will take effect
from April 30 and there will be a disarmament under the auspices

<P>
In return the PNG government has agreed to a phased withdrawal
of all defense force troops subject to the restoration of civil
authority.
</P>
<P>
It has also agreed to grant amnesty to those involved in
"crisis related activities."
</P>
<P>
A further meeting is planned for the end of June in
Bougainville to discuss the political issue of independence.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Saturday's opening of the
cable-stay Jiangwan Bridge in Guangzhou, capital of south China's
Guangdong Province, has ended the city's 100 year history of
operating a bus ferry.
</P>
<P>
The bridge, which stretches 2,300 meters across the Zhujiang
River, links the urban districts of Haizhu and Fangcun. The
structure was constructed by a local tunnel development company
and Hong Kong-based New World Group at a cost of 1.8 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Zhujiang River divides the city's urban districts into
three sections. Five highway bridges spanning the river form a
comprehensive transportation network. The bridge, the first
Sino-overseas bridge construction project, opened to traffic on
January 1.

<HEADLINE> Rail Line Planned from South Africa to Nairobi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Negotiations have been
completed for the creation of a continuous rail link between the
Johannesburg-Pretoria complex and east Africa's capitals of
Nairobi, Dar-es-Salaam and Kampala, East African reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year deal has been struck by Trans Africa Railway
Corporation, partly owned by South Africa's state-run railway
operator Spoornet, and could revolutionize land-based trade
between eastern, central and southern Africa, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The new line, which could be ready for operations by as early
as May, is designed to not only compete with shipping services
currently running from Durban to Tanzania's capital Dar-es-salaam
and Kenya's second-largest city Mombasa, but to be quicker and
cheaper.
</P>
<P>
It is expected to open up new markets for the 14 members of
the Southern African Development Community while allowing much
more cost-efficient access to mineral-rich areas in the region.
</P>
<P>
The first part of the project, expected to cost some 12
million Dollars, includes the purchase of 15 locomotives costing
three million Dollars, and 200 wagons worth five million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure seamless cargo traffic, a three-million
Dollar-trans-shipment complex is to be built at Kidatu, about 250
kilometers southwest of Dar-es-Salaam, where the wider gauge line
from Livingstone in Zambia meets the narrower line from the
Tanzanian capital to Kampala.
</P>
<P>
The major saving in time will be with the rail cartage between
Johannesburg and Kampala via Kidatu, which takes no more than two
weeks, compared to the six-week journey on the rail-sea-rail
route of Johannesburg-Durban-Mombasa-Kampala.
</P>
<P>
Costs are expected to run in at 10 to 20 percent below
shipping tariffs.
</P>
<P>
With the new system not even operational yet, there are
apparently already plans in the works for further expansions
which will open up even more of Africa to continuous rail
traffic, bringing the century-old dream of a Cape to Cairo rail
link closer to reality, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Tension Continues in Serbia's Kosovo Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, Jan 25 (Xinhua) -- The ethnic tension in Serbia's
southern province of Kosovo continued as a Serb politician was
killed on Friday evening near the town of Srbica.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade media quoted Srbica police as saying that his car was
"literally riddled with bullets."
</P>
<P>
Although no one had claimed responsibility for the "gruesome
act," Friday's murder was widely speculated to be in retaliation
for the Thursday death of an Albanian man, who was killed after
police surrounded his home and opened fire on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Police denied any responsibility for the death and said the
Albanian man was a victim of gang violence.
</P>
<P>
Some 20,000 people turned out on Friday night to mourn his
death.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian News Agency Sunday quoted Albanian sources in
Kosovo saying that the Serbian police had intervened in a rough
manner in a Kosovo town 45 kilometers southwest of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
In a conflict with local residents, at least two Serbian
officers were wounded. Five Albanians were arrested and several
were abused, said the same source.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian Interior Ministry's Information Service said in a
statement on Sunday that a terrorist attack had been carried out
against a police patrol from Orahovac in Malishevo on Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
The patrol had been assaulted with firearms and two persons in
the patrol were injured.
</P>
<P>
A rocket was launched at a building of the Interior Ministry in
the Klina municipality about 08:40 p.m. on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Police were looking for the perpetrators of the attacks, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo's branch of the Serbian Socialist Party has asked local
police and other state bodies to take "strong measures to secure
the safety of Kosovo citizens."
</P>
<P>
Serbia's Radical Party has also been quick in denouncing the
further violence. In a press statement on Saturday, the Radicals
demanded that the Serbian government do everything in its power to
eradicate terrorism in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Following this "week of deaths" in Kosovo, all sides in the
hot-bed province are calling for stronger measures to prevent
further bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade Radio 92 said that the Democratic Forum of Kosovo, an
ethnic Albanian political group, has demanded that the
international community take a more active role in the region.
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent Saturday to the heads of Europe's main
political bodies, the group suggested that Kosovo be placed under
special international protection.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Colombia Want Representation of Developing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Both Malaysia and Colombia
said Monday the developing countries should be well represented in
the United Nations Security Council which is undergoing reforms.
</P>
<P>
The view was expressed by Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah
Badawi and his Colombian counterpart Maria E. Mejia Velez at a
joint news conference after their hour-long meeting here.
</P>
<P>
Badawi told reporters that the ongoing reforms of the UN
Security council were one of the major issues the two sides
discussed during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) of which both Malaysia
and Colombia are members called for the reforms of the UN Security
Council for many years and the reforms were of great importance to
the NAM, of which Colombia is currently the chairman.
</P>
<P>
On the issue, Velez said that if there would be any expansion
of the Security Council at all, developing countries has to be
represented to reflect the new world order.
</P>
<P>
"NAM countries have to be there in decision-making of the
Security Council," she said.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral relations, Badawi said that at Monday's meeting,
the two sides discussed the possibility of inking an agreement on
avoidance of double taxation between Malaysia and Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also stressed the need for enhancing
bilateral trade, which stood at 39 million U.S. dollars now.
</P>
<P>
Velez, who arrived here Saturday night on a three-day official
visit to Malaysia, is scheduled to call on Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows Younger Drug Addicts in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Turkish drug addicts are
becoming younger and younger, arousing grave concern in the
Muslim-dominated nation, local newspaper Daily News reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The average age of drug addiction has fallen to 17, according
to a survey conducted by the Prime Ministry Family Research
Institution Directorate.
</P>
<P>
This forms a sharp contrast with the result of earlier surveys
which showed an elder age.
</P>
<P>
The latest finding also shows that it usually takes the
parents around two years to find that their children use drugs.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 60 percent of the addicts like using
drugs at home, 32 percent at their friends' house, 5 percent at
bars and coffee houses and 2 percent outdoors.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has long been a country which is used as a "corridor" by
some international drug dealers to transport their goods to the
European markets.

<HEADLINE> Harbin Families Plan Spring Festival Travel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, January 26 (Xinhua) -- More families in Harbin, the
so-called "City of Ice" and the capital of northeast China's
Heilongjiang Province, will travel during the forthcoming Spring
Festival days, a traditional period for family reunion.
</P>
<P>
The increased preference for travel is the result of a longer
holiday season during this year's Spring Festival, a fact which
represents yet another marked improvement in the living standards
of Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Wang Ming's family of three flew to Sanya in south China's
Hainan Province on Sunday to spend the Spring Festival period
between January 28-30.
</P>
<P>
Meng Meng, Wang's seven-year-old daughter, expressed delight at
having the opportunity to spend this year's holiday in Hainan
where she can enjoy greenery and wear summer clothing, a sharp
contrast to the snow and ice in Harbin.
</P>
<P>
Tourism experts note that an increasing number of Harbin
residents have exhibited a preference for family trips during this
year's Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
Local civil aviation departments report that some 50,000 Harbin
residents will fly to different areas in south China between
January 18-28.
</P>
<P>
The Harbin Railway Station has sold all tickets to Dalian,
Shanghai and Beijing in advance.
</P>
<P>
The Harbin Railway Travel Agency reports that more than 2,000
people have booked tickets for tour itineraries offered during the
holiday period.
</P>
<P>
The Harbin-China International Travel Service has also provided
bookings for more tourists. Some 300-odd people have booked
tickets, including a number of private businesspeople. A number of
people will travel to Russia, and 70 will tour Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
A large number of urban residents also plan to spend Spring
Festival in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Spending Spring Festival with rural families provides urban
families with an interesting opportunity to enjoy countryside
cooking and fireworks, as well as a chance to see farmers perform
the Yango dance, a popular rural art form.

<HEADLINE> SADC Countries Urged to Ratify Trade Protocol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) Secretariat has urged member
countries to ratify the trade Protocol signed in 1996 so as to
quicken the process of economic integration in the region.
</P>
<P>
"The protocol has raised much expectations to the private
sectors in and outside the region which consider SADC as an
attractive destination for investment," said Kaire Mbuende,
executive secretary of the SADC secretariat, here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Local paper Noticias today quoted Mbuende as expressing regret
over the slowness by SADC members in ratifying the Protocol, and
blaming it on bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
"The economic integration process in the region will be
delayed if a free-trade area fails to be established as
prescribed in the trade Protocol," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to the SADC official, the Protocol, once coming into
effect after ratified by two-thirds of its members, will not only
provide much larger market for the region, but also enhance
efficiency in local markets, since it may stimulate competitions
within the southern African region.
</P>
<P>
At present, since a regional market privilege has not been
materialized, the capital injected into SADC depends mainly on
the "separate market advantages" by individual members.

<HEADLINE> Dependents Demonstrate Outside ICRC Office in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Sri Lankans
gathered outside the office compound of the International
Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) here Monday morning and asked the
organization to help them obtain names of those security personnel
who they said are in LTTE custody.
</P>
<P>
Under scorching sunlight, the man and women, who were the next
of kin of those missing servicemen in the north, were waiting in
desperation.
</P>
<P>
Their representatives were holding closed-door talks with ICRC
officials.
</P>
<P>
The placards in their hands read: "ICRC must give the figures
of missing military and security personnel." "Let us see our
brothers and sons--Parents."
</P>
<P>
A banner asked: "What happened to the people captured by the
LTTE?"
</P>
<P>
Most of the demonstrators were Sinhala people while some of
them were Tamils. Their brothers and sons are missing in action
against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in the north.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators asked that while thousands of relatives are
being burnt in the flame of sorrow due to the most tragic
incidents in their country, why are the government, opposition and
ICRC silent about the warriors?
</P>
<P>
A petition which was handed over Monday morning to the ICRC
office said that the innocent parents and wives are now suffering
mentally and physically because of the loss of their beloved
children and husbands.
</P>
<P>
A participant said they turned to the ICRC for help because
they are the only persons who can enter the LTTE territories to
contact the rebels.
</P>
<P>
They also handed their requests to the government. But more of
their expectations are on the ICRC, the man said.
</P>
<P>
He said the demonstrators would continue their action outside
the ICRC office until it accepts their request to obtain a name
list of those missing persons from the LTTE.
</P>
<P>
An ICRC official said this was the first demonstration outside
their office premises. Another senior ICRC official said they were
not informed of the demonstration beforehand.
</P>
<P>
So far there are no results of talks.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Sets $1.6 M Publicity Blitz to Rescue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Tourist Board is
planning to spend one billion Shillings (1.6 million U.S.
Dollars) on an aggressive publicity and media campaign to
counteract a disastrous slump in tourism.
</P>
<P>
James Flannery, KTB's technical adviser, has said the campaign
will last six months, ending in June, and will target Germany,
Britain, France, Italy, Switzerland and the United States, its
major markets.
</P>
<P>
The drive will involve the government as well as private
sector players such as hotels, tour operations, travel agents and
airlines, he was quoted by Monday's East African weekly as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, foreign travel writers will be invited to
Kenya and KTB will advertise widely in European and American
publications, he said.
</P>
<P>
The optimistic view is that tourism will record a gradual
recovery during the first quarter of this year since the
elections were relatively free of violence and the troubles at
the Coast have subsided.
</P>
<P>
However, Kenya's tourism sector is facing extreme problems,
with business as much as 70 percent down as a result primarily of
violence in some Coastal areas and the devastating effects of El
Nino.
</P>
<P>
The KTB estimates loss of revenue up to July of this year will
be 283 million Dollars. Tourism earings for 1996, itself a modest
year, were 433 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Many hotels at the Kenya Coast laid off staff and some closed
when large-scale cancellations followed an eruption of violence
and arson, never officially explained, in second-largest city of
Mombasa and nearby areas in August.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, floods brought by the El Nino weather
phenomenon made travel impossible within and outside of many game
areas and some lodges flew in visitors at their own expense.
</P>
<P>
For several days, Mombasa was cut off from the rest of the
country and imports to Uganda were held up when torrential rains
swept away bridges on the road to Nairobi earlier this month.
Floods have killed over 86 people in the eastern African nation.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the industry needs generous and imaginative
assistance from the government to reverse what appears to be a
continuing decline.
</P>
<P>
Dedan Kamau, Chief Executive of the Kenya Association of
Hoteliers and Caterers, called on the Kenyan government to give
the industry tax-breaks and concessions.
</P>
<P>
Road, power and communications problems, an apparent inability
to counter negative publicity and a lack of incentives for
foreigners to visit Kenya were major drawbacks, he noted.
</P>
<P>
A power blackout gripped Kenya Sunday afternoon due to a
technical fault on a generation equipment at Gitaru power
station, sending early fears across the land of huge economic
losses.

<HEADLINE> Biological Resources Contribute to Yunnan's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Yunnan Province in southwest
China is making greater efforts to tap biological resources and
promote it to a pillar industry by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan, known as China's "kingdom of plants" or "treasure-house
of genes", selected 18 of its several hundred biological resources
as major development projects.
</P>
<P>
And in 1997, it had nearly 4.5 billion yuan in output value
from biological resources tapping, 1.1 billion of which were
provided by industrial production, 4.1 times that in 1994 when it
first started the business.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises participating in the effort averaged annual
increases of 16.2 percent during the period, much higher than the
provincial industrial growth.
</P>
<P>
By now, 90 projects relating to biological resources have been
open, with some high-tech products doing well on the market, and
more than 40 enterprises from domestic and overseas joining the
effort.
</P>
<P>
The province is working on some favorable policies to further
develop biological resources, which are expected to provide 10
billion yuan in annual output value at the turn of the century,
becoming one of the four major economic contributors.
</P>
<P>
"Biological resource exploration enjoys the most rapid growth
speed, and is also the most promising newly-emerging industry," a
local government official said.

<HEADLINE> Commonwealth Raises Fund for South Asian Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- A 115-million-US-dollar
investment fund has been raised by the Commonwealth for the South
Asian countries, according to a local press report Monday.
</P>
<P>
The South Asian Regional Fund (SARF) will be made available for
equity and equity-related investment in all seven member countries
of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC),
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The SARF, officially launched by British Prime Minister Tony
Blair at the Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Edinburgh
in October last year, was created in Singapore on January 16 this
year.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC includes Bangladesh, India, the Maldives, Pakistan
and Sri Lanka, which are members of the Commonwealth, and Bhutan
and Nepal, which are not Commonwealth members but will also
benefit from the fund.
</P>
<P>
The fund is the third of a series of regional investment funds
under the Commonwealth Private Investment Initiative, which was
jointly put forward by the Commonwealth finance ministers and the
Commonwealth Development Corporation and supported by the
Commonwealth Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
Although the amount raised at the first closing was 115 million
dollars, the final closing in the middle of this year is expected
to be between 150 and 200 million dollars, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Kunming Shoppers Prefer Local Flavor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Spring Festival is drawing near
and local residents in Kunming, capital of Yunnan Province, are
busily shopping on the city's annual "festival goods street".
</P>
<P>
However, this year's shoppers seem to have altered their habits
compared with previous years, selecting special items with local
flavor rather than the more conventional festive goods.
</P>
<P>
For example, edible bark and tree flowers, specialties from the
Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture, have emerged as a favorite. "We
sell several tons of bark and flowers daily and the supply is
falling short of demand," according to a young vender from the Bai
ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
The young man not only engages in retail sales, but also signed
a contract to supply products valued at over one million yuan
(120,000 U.S. dollars) to a Kunming department store.
</P>
<P>
Cheese products remain a favorite, and sales of edible wild
herbs have skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
A variety of "fruit turnip" grown in Yuxi in central Yunnan is
also a popular item, with over 100 tons sold over the past ten
days alone.
</P>
<P>
Organizers note that brand name products from across the
country previously accounted for over 60 percent of total goods
sold during the fair. However, products from Yunnan have accounted
for some 90 percent of this year's sales.
</P>
<P>
"We offer goods to meet consumer preferences for natural and
wild products," according to one organizer.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Denver Broncos succeeded
in their fifth bid for the Super Bowl triumph when they beat Green
Bay Packers 31-24 in one of the most exciting Super Bowl on Sunday
in San Diego, the United States.
</P>
<P>
And Broncos became the first wild card team to win the honor
since the Oakland Raiders in 1981.
</P>
<P>
The victory ended the 13-consecutive year of Super Bowl drought
for the American Football Conference (AFC), also ruined Packers'
hope to become the first team to reign the trophy.
</P>
<P>
The Broncos' quarter-back Terrell Davis made his way to 157
yards rushing and threw for three touchdowns on the ground for a
Super Bowl record.
</P>
<P>
Each team had a touchdown in its first possession, another
Super Bowl record in its 28-year history.
</P>
<P>
But the Broncos never took the lead until 1:45 minutes left on
the clock, when Davis burst through the middle for his third
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
Needing a touchdown to run the game into overtime, Packers
quarterback Brett Favre found tight end Mark Chmura on the ground,
but the latter failed to turn the pass into a big gain.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Records Rising Revenue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGDONG, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Province, an
economic powerhouse in south China, generated a revenue totalling
71.4 billion yuan (8.60 billion US dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The figure accounted for 10 percent of the national total and
enabled the province to retain its position as the country's
leading revenue earner for the seventh consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the fact that revenue growth for 1997 slowed somewhat
when compared to previous years, it was nonetheless higher than
the rate for economic growth and expenditures," according to
Guangdong deputy governor Wang Qishan.
</P>
<P>
Factors affecting the growth in revenue included economic
readjustments, falling enterprise profits, and a lower inflation
rate, said Wang.
</P>
<P>
Wang, formerly working with the Construction Bank of China,
noted that the province still faces an arduous task in balancing
revenue and expenditures. He called for a further expansion of
revenue sources and reduced expenditures.
</P>
<P>
The province's expenditures for 1997 hit 68 billion yuan, with
the growth rate ending 1.6 percentage points lower than the rate
for revenue.

XI'NING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Over 300,000 head of livestock
have died and some 10,000 herdsmen have either been injured or are
suffering from illness due to sustained low temperature resulting
from snow accumulations in southern Qinghai Province, northwest
China.
</P>
<P>
The provincial disaster relief office reports that temperatures
have dropped to 38 degrees below zero Celsius in the Yushu and
Guoluo Tibetan nationality autonomous prefectures, which have
suffered from heavy snowstorms since last September.
</P>
<P>
Ninetyfour of the 217 families reported as missing have
not as yet been found.
</P>
<P>
Extremely poor road conditions have blocked the movement of
relief materials to the disaster-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
Many herdsmen have suffered from fuel shortages resulting from
this year's early arrival of heavy snow.
</P>
<P>
The Qinghai Provincial Meteorological Station predicts
additional heavy snow in southern Qinghai from late January
through mid-March.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Is Ready to Tell Story: Lawyer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton's supporters Sunday defended him against allegations of
sexual misconduct while Monica Lewinsky's lawyer said she was
"dying" to tell her story in exchange for immunity from
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Aides took an aggressive stand to counter allegations that
Clinton had an affair with Lewinsky when she was a 21-year-old
White House intern and then urged her to lie about it in a scandal
that seems to threaten his presidency.
</P>
<P>
William Ginsburg, Lewinsky's attorney, said she would be
delighted to cooperate with Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth
Starr if he grants her full immunity from prosecution but is
"frozen" if he does not.
</P>
<P>
"We are dying to tell the story," the lawyer said on NBC's
"Meet the Press."
</P>
<P>
Ginsburg's talks on a possible deal with Starr's office
produced no results but were continuing Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We are frozen in place because we are in jeopardy as long as
there is a threat of criminal prosecution, she has an absolute
right ... not to incriminate herself," Ginsburg said.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky said in a sworn affidavit she did not have an affair
with Clinton but, in taped telephone conversations with a friend,
is reported to have said she had oral sex with him in the White
House and "telephone" sex with him late at night.
</P>
<P>
Starr is investigating whether Clinton and Vernon Jordan, a
friend and an influential Washington lawyer, urged Lewinsky to lie
about whether she had an affair with the president.
</P>
<P>
Clinton denied the charges on several occasions Wednesday and
Thursday, but left unanswered questions about the exact nature of
his relationship with the young woman.
</P>
<P>
Clinton allies took an aggressive stance on a series of
television talk shows.
</P>
<P>
Clinton "has said clearly, personally, directly, four times,
these allegations are false, 'I did not have an improper
relationship, I did not have a sexual relationship, I did not tell
anyone to lie,'" White House communications director Ann Lewis
told Fox News Channel.
</P>
<P>
The president "emphatically denies it," said James Carville,
Clinton's former campaign manager. "He has denied it to staff, has
denied it to the news media, has denied it to the American people
and denied to his Cabinet and denied it to his friends. I can't
get any more emphatic about that."
</P>
<P>
"There's going to be a war," Carville added, criticizing
Starr's tactics in the case, which included wiring Lewinsky's
friend Linda Tripp with a secret microphone, as "scuzzy, sleazy."
</P>
<P>
"There's going to be a war. The friends of the president are
disgusted by these kinds of tactics. We're going to fight and
we're going to fight very hard," he added.
</P>
<P>
But there were new media reports about the sex scandal Sunday.
</P>
<P>
ABC News reported that "several sources have told us that in
the spring of 1996 the president and Lewinsky were caught in an
intimate encounter in a private area of the White House."
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post reported Sunday that Clinton had
acknowledged to friends that he had a close relationship with the
woman because they shared turbulent childhoods but denied a sexual
relationship.
</P>
<P>
New opinion polls show his public support eroding amid a
growing feeling that he has not been candid about the scandal.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Thailand-U.S. Relations Overshadowed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 26 (Xinhua) -- After Thai Finance Minister
Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda returned home from Washington empty-handed
on Saturday, Thai-U.S. Relations came under shadow cast by the
U.S. Reluctance to help Thailand in its hour of need.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here noted that Thailand needs more than pro-democracy
leanings and its long friendship with the United States to win
substantial support from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Thailand needs additional funds outside the IMF-brokered
17.2-billion-dollar standby credit -- to which Washington did not
contribute -- to shore up its 27-billion-dollar foreign currency
reserves, in order to restore international investors' confidence.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin's just-concluded visit was aimed at winning the U.S.
Financial support which Thailand badly needs to tide over the
current financial crisis. But Washington is reluctant to come to
Thailand's rescue.
</P>
<P>
Darmp Sukontasap, a lecturer on international relations at
Chulalongkorn University in Thailand, said in remarks published
Monday that Thailand needed to make it clear to Washington what
the consequences for American businesses were if it failed to
help.
</P>
<P>
Thai economists have warned that more than a million Americans
would lose jobs over the next two years if cheap goods from Asia
flooded into the American market.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts interpreted Washington's reluctance to help as an
indication that Thailand's strategic importance is in doubt, in
comparison with Indonesia and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The United States has contributed to the IMF's bailout package
for Indonesia and South Korea. The U.S. move is viewed as a
confirmation of these two countries' importance to the American
security interest.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, the most populated and largest country in Southeast
Asia, controls main shipping lanes between the Indian and Pacific
oceans, one of the world's most important trade routes. Its
collapse would shake the entire region.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, the world's 11th largest economy, is also seen as
important to security in East Asia. It has U.S. Troops based on
its territory.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Tarrin's fruitless trip to Washington indicated a
turning point in the U.S. Policy towards Thailand.
</P>
<P>
They noted that Thailand's strategic value pales into
insignificance with the end of the cold war and fighting in
Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
"Thailand is no longer a tangible issue in geo-politics," a
senior Foreign Ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
The government therefore had to do things to boost its
importance in the region, perhaps by playing a bigger role in
regional affairs, to win over support from Washington, said the
official, who refused to be named.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. policy towards Thailand is one of no policy now," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts attributed Washington's apathy towards Thailand's
economic difficulty to Bangkok's backing for Myanmar's entry into
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) last year.
</P>
<P>
But a recent survey poll showed that the majority of Americans
were opposed to the U.S. government's support for the troubled
economics in Thailand and some other Asian nations, unless the
crisis imperiled the U.S. Economy.
</P>
<P>
Analysts warned that Washington needed Thailand's cooperation
if it wanted to position arms in the gulf of Thailand on a
floating base which would be linked to military bases in Japan and
Diego Garcia in the Indian ocean.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Completes Own Section of Gas Pipeline Running </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has completely laid its
own 414-kilometer section of the 674-kilometer-long natural gas
pipeline running from the Yadana gas field in the Gulf of Mottama
to Thailand's Ratchaburi, The Mirror newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Endeavors are being made for timely completion of the overall
project on the Myanmar side scheduled by July, it said.
</P>
<P>
According to some recent Thai reports, the remaining
260-kilometer pipeline section on the Thai side is unlikely to
complete on schedule.
</P>
<P>
The Yadana natural gas field is jointly developed on a
production sharing basis by a foreign oil group, which comprises
TOTAL (France), UNOCAL (the United States) and PTTEP (Thailand),
and MOGE (state-run Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise).
</P>
<P>
It is reported that profit from the project will be shared by
TOTAL with 31.24 percent, UNOCAL 28.26 percent, PTTEP 25.5 percent
and MOGE 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Under a 30-year contract reached between the developers and the
Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT) in January 1995, natural gas
from the Yadana field will be sold to Thailand starting July this
year.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to export more rice and aquatic products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam plans to export 4 million
tonnes of rice and to earn around 850 million US dollars from
aquatic produce exports in 1998, local press reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
A decision to permit export of 4 million tonnes of rice this
year has been signed by Vietanm's prime minister Phan Van Khai.
</P>
<P>
Quotas for export of 2.8 million tonnes of rice will be
allocated to provinces and local businesses, and 1.2 million
tonnes to central companies.
</P>
<P>
Rice export permit for 90 per cent of the amount will be
granted to provinces and businesses to be implemented from January
to September.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also decided an import limit of 1.6 million
tonnes of urea, 300,000 tonnes of dap fertilizer, 350,000 tonnes
of npk and 240,000 tonnes of kcl fertilizer with quotas to be
granted to importers within January.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam also plans to catch 1.6 million tonnes of maritime
produce and earn around 850 million US dollars from aquatic
produce exports this year.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's fisheries industry attaches great importance to
measures to process aquatic products and export raw, processed and
instant marine products.
</P>
<P>
The country now has 176 food processing factories with a
combined capacity of more than 140,000 tonnes per year and the
export of rough aquatic products bring low economic efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Vietnam caught 1.57 million tonnes of marine
products and earned 776 million US dollars from exports.

<HEADLINE> First Phase Of Chinese Dam Resettlement Project Working </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The first phase of
ressetlement for the World Bank-financed Xiaolangdi Water Control
Project in central China was approved recently.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Ministry of Water Resources visited the
resettlement centers in the project area from January 13 to 20 and
believed that the welfare facilities and environmental conditions
were a great improvement. The farmers in the centers each have an
average floor space of 26 sq.m. and one-15th of a hectare of
farmland.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River, on which the project is being built, was
dammed on October 28 last year. It is reported that the
project would need more than one billion US dollars in World Bank
loan, the largest with World Bank loans in China.
</P>
<P>
When it is completed in 2001, it will be able to withstand the
worst flood which used to occur every 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
The water backed up by the dam will cover eight counties in
Henan and Shanxi provinces, which needs to resettle 200,000 local
people. The first phase of the resettlement project started in
early 1995 in three counties in Henan. By the end of last year,
more than one billion yuan had been spent on the project and 33
resettlement villages built, with a combined floor space
of 1.16 million sq.m. and 3,000 hectares of land.
</P>
<P>
The second phase is in full swing and 120,000 people will be
moved before the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Georgian President Stresses Economic Cooperation in CIS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Georgian President Eduard
Shevardnadze said Saturday that countries of the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) should pay more attention to economic
issues, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with CIS Executive Secretary Ivan Korotchenya
in Georgian capital Tbilisi, Shevardnadze said 70 percent of the
decisions made so far within the CIS were political and military,
only 30 percent were related to economy.
</P>
<P>
Special importance should be attached to the development of
free trade, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Georgian president also called on the leaders of the CIS
countries to make joint efforts to strengthen friendship between
the peoples and refrain from any conflicts including ethnic and
religious conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze was quoted by other reports as saying Sunday, also
his 70th birthday, that the Abkhazia conflict will be resolved
before the end of his mandate.
</P>
<P>
Abkhazia, an autonomous republic of Georgia, declared
independence from Georgia in February 1992. Under the mediation of
Russia and the United Nations, a ceasefire was reached in May 1994.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze and Abkhazian President Ardzinba agreed to resolve
the conflicts by political means after their first meeting last
August. However, the final status of Abkhazia has yet to be
decided.
</P>
<P>
The day for Georgia to unify its territory is not very far,
added the Georgian president, and the most important problem is
how to ensure the safety of the refugees who will be organized to
return to Abkhazia in two to three years.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government to Expedite Privatization Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government will speed
up privatization of state enterprises and sell off its shares in
private companies in an effort to prop up the state coffers.
</P>
<P>
A privatization bill worked out by the government will soon be
submitted to parliament for approval, Monday's Bangkok Post quoted
an informed Government House source as saying.
</P>
<P>
Expedition of the privatization process is necessary for
raising funds to avoid further budget cuts, the unidentified
source said.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) requires Thailand to
maintain a surplus budget amounting to one percent of the GDP or
69 billion baht (1.3 billion U.S. dollars), as a condition for a
bailout package intended to help Thailand defuse the financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Thailand would not seek a review of the condition imposed by
the IMF, the source said.
</P>
<P>
But the task to maintain a surplus budget may be daunting
because the government is facing a budget shortfall, estimated at
100 billion baht (1.88 billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> Northeast China Province to Reduce Surplus Medical Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province plans to reduce its medical workers by at least 30,000
over the next two to three years.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Li Ren, director of the Department of
Public Health of Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
He said these laidoff workers will account for over 10
percent of the province's total medical workers.
</P>
<P>
Li said the provincial medical organizations currently have
over 50,000 surplus workers.
</P>
<P>
Some ineffective medical departments will be closed, he said,
adding medical departments in urban areas will be encouraged to
focus on public health services, such as caring for terminally ill
patients and operating homes for pensioners.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning will also introduce the joint stock system to two
county hospitals, according to Li.
</P>
<P>
Over 50 percent of the province's 200 communal hospitals face
possible closure, due to low turnover rates for both outpatient and
inpatient care.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Foreign Exchange Reserves Shrink </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' gross
international reserves have dropped to a four-year low of 8.8
billion US dollars, mainly due to the payments of foreign debts,
the Central Bank said.
</P>
<P>
Central bank governor Gabriel Singson clarified that the drop
was not due to intervention by the monetary authorities at the
currency spot market to prevent the peso from further sliding
down, local press reports said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
At this level, the foreign exchange reserves were about 500
million dollars less compared to the 9.3 billion dollar reserves
at the onset of the year.
</P>
<P>
Singson assured, however, that the central bank is still
planning to beef up its reserves through borrowings from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Asian Development Bank
(ADB) and from a consortium of international banks.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is eyeing anywhere from 500 million
dollars to 1 billion dollars in quick-disbursing loans from the
ADB.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the central bank is planning to raise up to 1
billion dollars through a "club loan" from a consortium of
international banks, the details of which are still being worked
out.
</P>
<P>
Funds from the IMF are also expected under the current program
and a new program that the country plans to undertake anew. Total
IMF loans are seen at around 3 billion dollars, Singson said.
</P>
<P>
The ability of the central bank to boost its reserves would
provide confidence to the market that the country has adequate
foreign exchange reserves to meet its import and debt payments, he
added.

AMMAN -- King Hussein of Jordan said here Sunday evening that
he and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak confirmed the necessity to
save the Middle East peace process from its current deadlock
during their meeting in Cairo late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Upon his return from a brief visit to Cairo, the king described
his meeting with Mubarak as "constructive, fruitful and extremely
successful."
</P>
<P>
The king refused to give details about the summit, which has
been the first between the two leaders this year and just days
after the separate meetings between U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat as well as between Clinton
and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
A Jordanian government official, who declined to be named, told
Xinhua Sunday that the king paid his visit to Cairo mainly because
of the failure of the Washington summits.

BAGHDAD -- Iraq Sunday accused Richard Sebritzel, an American
in the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling
Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, of telling lies for prolonging
the sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Sebritzel in charge of the biological file has reportedly said
that he had information to prove that Iraq was operating a secret
plant for biological weapons in defiance of the U.N.-imposed
embargo.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that he has no tangible evidence that can be
tabled to the U.N. Security Council. If such evidence was
available, it would put an end to the ongoing controversy on the
lifting of the U.N. sanctions on Iraq, he said.

<P>
CANBERRA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Steady drizzle delayed some
matches of the Australian Open tennis tournament in Melbourne on
Monday, except on center court where key singles matches went
ahead under a sliding roof.
</P>
<P>
Rain which began on Saturday night has persisted, leaving
hardcore fans with ground passes sitting Wimbledon-style under
umbrellas on outside showcourts.
</P>
<P>
On center court, Australian doubles specialist Todd Woodbridge
-- the only Australian left in either singles draw -- was facing
France's Nicolas Escude in a fourth-round match.
</P>
<P>
Tournament officials said play could resume on other courts if
the rain stopped, but there was no sign of a break in the weather.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, some fourth-round men's matches were moved to the
center court.

<HEADLINE> 1.5 Million People in Central China Province Shake Off Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Some 1.5 million people in
central China's Henan Province shook off poverty in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The achievement was attributed to painstaking efforts of the
local government to eradicate poverty.
</P>
<P>
Henan, an agricultural province with a population
of some 90 million, is home to a large number of poverty-stricken
people, particularly in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the province earmarked 25 million yuan to support
industrial and agricultural projects targeted at alleviating
poverty and raising the income of the rural population. China's
official poverty line currently stands at 550 yuan a year.
</P>
<P>
Eleven counties, or one-third of the province's
poverty-stricken counties, shook off poverty in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Related measures included building roads to poor villages,
improving power facilities, installing telephones and increasing
supplies of potable water.

BONN, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie
highlighted in the Karlsruhe Indoor Athletics Games by setting a
3,000 meters world record of seven minutes 26.14 seconds on Sunday
in Karlsruhe, Gemany.
</P>
<P>
Double Olympic 10,000-meter champion Gebrselassie bettered his
own previous best mark of 7:30.72 set in February 1996 in
Stuttgart.
</P>
<P>
But his 5,000 and 10,000 meters outdoor world records were
stolen by Kenyans Daniel Komen and Paul Tergat last August.
</P>
<P>
The Games stamped with a series of dramatic performances from
other athletes.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian Anzhela Balachanova surpassed 4.33 meters in the
women's pole vault - the best ever by an European.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Davidson Ezinwa and Osmond Ezinwa made a one-two in
the men's 60 meters, 6.56 and 6.57 respectively, while their
countrywomen Chioma Ajunwa and Christe Opara repeated the feat in
the women's counterpart, 7.07 and 7.15 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Russian Wjatscheslav Schabunin won the men's 1,500 meters gold
medal in 3:37.88, disappointing Germany's Dieter Baumann who was
less than half a second trailing.

<P>
BERLIN, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Jan Bos of Netherlands made an
impressive sprint to take gold at the sprint speed skating world
championships on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Bos, 22, outsprinted the 1,000 meters world record holder
Jeremy Wotherspoon of Canada in one minute 11.10 seconds, also
pocketing an overall triumph.
</P>
<P>
Wotherspoon, World Cup leader, would be content with the silver
medal while Erben Wennemars rounded off the brilliant parade of
the Dutch team by taking bronze.
</P>
<P>
Bos, who had sent himself right on the way heading for next
month's Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, won the both opening
races on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Wotherspoon bounced back to win in second run of the 500
meters, but failed in his title chase in the last 1,000.
</P>
<P>
In the women's races, prodigious Canadian Catriona Le May Doan
proved class of her own to take the title by winning both 500
meters and making third in each of the two legs of the 1,000.
</P>
<P>
Le May Doan, who broke the 500 world record twice last month in
Calgary, said she would enter the 500, the 1,000 metres and
possibly the 1,500 metres in Japan.

<HEADLINE> Germany's SPD to Make Unemployment Top Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Germany's main opposition party,
the Social Democratic Party (SPD) said Sunday that it would attach
top priority to the issue of combating unemployment in its
election campaign against Chancellor Helmut Kohl's ruling
coalition.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a SPD leadership meeting in the western German
town of Goslar, party leader Oskar Lafontaine said the SPD would
focus its election campaign on those substantive issues which
include first of all the question of how to really cut back
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Germany is due to hold the next general elections on September
27 this year.
</P>
<P>
With the country suffering from a post-war record unemployment
of 4.5 million and the political deadlock in Bonn over the
much-needed tax reform, Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU)
party has been trailing SPD in popularity in almost all opinion
polls.
</P>
<P>
Although the government predicts an economic growth of between
2.5 percent and 3.0 percent, even Kohl himself admitted there
would be no improvement on the job market this year.
</P>
<P>
Both the CDU and SPD are now labelling itself as the right
choice to bring about necessary changes to Germany which is led by
Kohl in the past 16 years.
</P>
<P>
However, in order to challenge Kohl, who has already decided to
seek an unprecedented fifth term in office, the SPD has still to
choose its own chancellor candidate between Lafontaine and his
rival, the Lower Saxony premier, Gerhard Schroeder. A decision on
the issue is not expected to be made before early March.

<HEADLINE> New Survey Shows Two Thirds in Favor of Switzerland's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Two out of three Swiss people
are in favor of their country's eventual joining of the European
Union (EU), according to the results of a recent opinion poll.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland's German newspaper Sonntagzeitung questioned 605
people last Thursday and Friday. The results published today show
that 57 percent of the people questioned will vote "yes" if a
second national referendum is to be held.
</P>
<P>
67 percent of them believe that Switzerland will be a member of
the EU in 2010.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that more people (57 percent) in the
French-speaking region than those (28 percent) in the
German-speaking region are in favor of the adhesion.
</P>
<P>
In the first referendum in 1992, a majority of Swiss voted
against joining the EU.

<HEADLINE> Millennium Bug Will Cost UK 52 Billion Pounds: Adviser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The cost of eliminating the
millennium computer bug from Britain is expected to top 52 billion
pounds, according to Robin Guenier, a former government adviser.
</P>
<P>
Guenier, now head of the independent Taskforce 2000, believes
the government and business people are continuing to underestimate
the depth of the problem.
</P>
<P>
He warned that out of the 52 billion pounds that would be
needed to tackle the problem the public sector would have to
commit no less than 12 billion pounds.
</P>
<P>
The millennium problem has arisen because many computer systems
use only two digits, not four, for dating purposes. When the year
changes from 99 to 00, experts say many applications will crash or
create data that are nonsense.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair has taken personal charge of
a campaign to raise awareness of the computer timebomb.
</P>
<P>
His influence was decisive in last week's launch of Action
2000, which has replaced Taskforce 2000 as the official bug
fighter.
</P>
<P>
Guenier criticize the government campaign for lack of measures
at the week end, saying "Action 2000 was announced in September
and nothing has been heard from it until now ..."
</P>
<P>
Action 2000 has an annual budget of 1 million pounds (1.6
million U.S. dollars), which, Guenier said, was inadequate.

<HEADLINE> Hussein, Mubarak Confirm Necessity to Save Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 25 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan said here
Sunday evening that he and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
confirmed the necessity to save the Middle East peace process from
its current deadlock during their meeting in Cairo late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Upon his return from a brief visit to Cairo, the king described
his meeting with Mubarak as "constructive, fruitful and extremely
successful."
</P>
<P>
The king refused to give details about the summit, which has
been the first between the two leaders this year and just days
after the separate meetings between U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat as well as between Clinton
and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
A Jordanian government official, who declined to be named,
told Xinhua Sunday that the king paid his visit to Cairo mainly
because the failure of the Washington summits.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday summit between Hussein and Mubarak was just the
beginning of coordination efforts among the Arab countries to
face the challenges after the failure of Clinton to bridge the gap
between Israel and the Palestinians, the source said.
</P>
<P>
As a part of the coordination efforts, Arafat will arrive in
Cairo on Monday to meet Mubarak, the source added.
</P>
<P>
The king was accompanied by Prime Minister Abdul Salam Majali,
Chief of the Royal Court Awn Khasawneh and Director of the
General Intelligence Department Samieh Al Bateeki during his
visit to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's official news agency Sunday reported that the two
leaders stressed the need to strive to salvage the peace process
and remove the obstacles impeding it.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed means of strengthening Arab solidarity and
coordination to bring the peace process back on track and to
reject all measures that are bound to undermine the peace process,
the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Jordan have been the only Arab countries that
signed peace treaties with Israel.
