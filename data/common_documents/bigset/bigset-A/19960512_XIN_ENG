<HEADLINE> Afghan Government Claims Victory Against Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan government said its
troops have captured some strategic areas controlled by the
Taliban near the capital city of Kabul, according to reports from
Kabul today.
</P>
<P>
Afghan defense officials were quoted as saying that government
forces Friday seized Chak and Daimirdad districts of central
Wardak province after an air attack.
</P>
<P>
Government troops killed at least seven soldiers of the Taliban
religious student movement, said the report.
</P>
<P>
"The attack was very successful as we seized two important
areas as well as a huge stock of heavy and light weapons,
ammunition and jeeps from the Taliban," a military officer said.
</P>
<P>
However, there is no independent confirmation of the capture of
Daimirdad district and Chak district, which lies next to the
Taliban's main supply road linking the area to their southern base
at Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
Both areas have been under the Taliban's control for almost 18
months, long before they moved to the outskirts of Kabul last
October in a bid to seize the city.
</P>
<P>
An Afghan official said in Kabul today that Pakistan would
reopen its embassy in the Afghan capital as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan is interested in improving relations between our two
governments and in resuming their diplomatic activities in Kabul
as soon as possible," said Afghan presidential spokesman Abdul
Aziz Murad.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan government sent an official delegation to Islamabad
this week, the first of its kind in eight months.
</P>
<P>
Murad said that during the visit, "we have said we are ready to
repair their damaged embassy here, but no date has yet been set
for the return of Pakistan's mission."
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani embassy in Kabul was badly damaged after an
attack last September, which led to Islamabad's withdrawal of its
mission and its chilly relationship with Kabul.
</P>
<P>
He added that Kabul was prepared to provide another building
for the embassy staff while the original one was being repaired.
</P>
<P>
"It was a goodwill mission and no agreements were signed, but
we were warmly welcomed and see the visit, which was significant
and aimed at warming ties between us, as a success," Murad said.

<HEADLINE> Reformist Candidates May Join Yeltsin in Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin said
today reformist candidates Grigory Yavlinsky, Alexander Lebed and
Svyatoslav Fyodorov might join him in the June 16 presidential
elections, Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Talking with local residents and reporters in Astrakhan,
southern Russia, Yeltsin stressed that his cooperation with the
three could take "various forms," meaning it was not necessary for
them to quit their candidacy.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov are expected to
win 30 percent of the votes each in the coming elections, leading
all the other nine candidates.
</P>
<P>
Yavlinsky, leader of the Yabloko bloc that is made up mainly of
intellectuals and businessmen in big cities, together with retired
general Lebed and eye surgeon Fyodorov, formed the so called
"Third Force" or "troika" early this year which is expected to
land 16 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
So if Yeltsin could succeed in bringing the "troika" over to
his side, it would surely be a great disadvantage for his main
political rival Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said that he had "already met Lebed and Yavlinsky" and
"is going to meet Fyodorov," believing "the troika will join the
team."
</P>
<P>
In early May, Yeltsin held "close-door" talks with Lebed and
Yavlinsky respectively, but no details were disclosed.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that Lebed and Yavlinsky will join the presidential
team, as I put it at a conference of the Astrakhan branch of the
all-Russian movement in support for my presidential candidacy, are
based on my personal conversations with them," Yeltsin added today.
</P>
<P>
"So far as Fyodorov is concerned, I know him, and my aides have
already contacted him. His statements about a possible creation of
an association of democratic candidates are about in the same vein
as mine. But I would like to continue the discussion with him"
</P>
<P>
Observers note, no matter what Yeltsin said today, it is too
early to conclude the "troika" will give up their candidacy and
turn to him.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Yavlinsky insisted after his talks with Yeltsin that
he would not withdraw his candidacy to improve Yeltsin's chances,
nor is there discussion of forming a coalition.
</P>
<P>
Boosted by the victory in the January State Duma (Russia's
lower house of parliament) elections, Communist leader Zyuganov
seemed not concerned by the possible alliance, saying: "A union
forged behind the back of the voters would only alienate them."
</P>
<P>
"You can't order the voters around," added he.

<HEADLINE> HK Social Groups Protest Against Chris Patten </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 100 social groups from
Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and the New Territories gathered at Kai
Tak Airport this evening to protest Governor Chris Patten for his
slander on Hong Kong's reputation and his depreciating of the
industrial and commercial sector.
</P>
<P>
Patten arrived at the airport this evening after a tour of
Canada and the United States.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 protesters put up hundreds of banners and slogans
which read "Protest on Chris Patten in Slandering", "The Touring
Governor Tells Brazen Lies" and "Protest Against Patten's
Depreciating SAR" to show their strong anger against the governor.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen of the groups issued protesting letters to Patten,
saying that Chris Patten used taxpayers' money fo his tour at the
name of urging the US for China's MFN status, but actually he was
trying to "internationalize Hong Kong's issues" and slander Hong
Kong's reputation.
</P>
<P>
The letters said that during his tour Patten disseminated
untruthful words to create conflicts among the industrial and
commercial sector, specialized sector and the middle class, so as
to instigate the relationship between Hong Kong people and Chinese
government.
</P>
<P>
The letters demanded Chris Patten to make clear to Hong Kong
people what he has done.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani FM Optimistic About ECO's Bright Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Ties among the Economic
Cooperation Organization (ECO) member states will be further
strengthened in the future, a senior Pakistani official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Talking to newsmen, Pakistani Foreign Minister Sardar Aseff
Ahmed Ali expressed his satisfaction over the active
implementation of the decisions taken at the third ECO summit held
in Islamabad last year.
</P>
<P>
ECO comprises ten countries -- Pakistan, Iran, Turkey,
Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kirghizstan,
Kazakhstan and Azerbaijian.
</P>
<P>
The fourth ECO summit is scheduled to open in Ashkabad, capital
of Turkmenistan, on May 14, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Foreign Minister said that the upcoming summit will
review an elaborate agenda besides the progress of the agreements
signed by ECO member states during the previous summits.
</P>
<P>
He said that the historical, cultural and social bonds binding
the peoples of the ten states are very old and deep rooted.
</P>
<P>
The ten states also enjoy the geographical proximity to each
other, he added.
</P>
<P>
The exploitation and correct utilization of the ten countries'
resources will enable the ECO to emerge as a very sound economic
bloc in the future, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Proper attention should be paid to the improvement and
development of infrastructure of the organization, especially the
land routes connecting the ECO member states, he added.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan could provide exemplary route facilities to the five
newly-emerged Central Asian States to the Arabian Sea easily, he
said.
</P>
<P>
A number of proposals have been prepared by a group of experts
and will be tabled in the fourth ECO Summit to make it more
effective for the cooperation among the member countries, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of ECO Bank of Trade and Development will be
underlined during the summit because it can boost the trade among
member states effectively, he said.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of ECO Science Foundation and Culture
Institute will also be discussed in the summit, he added.

KIEV, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian government is working on
its first economic experimental zone, the Sivash Economic
Experimental Zone (SEEZ), to find a path toward the transition to
market economy.
</P>
<P>
The SEEZ, named after the Sivash Lake, is located at the

promised favorable tax policies to protect investors' special
interests.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine is going to build another two experimental zones hoping

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and Ethiopian President Negasso Gidada held talks at the National Palace
here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he believes his current visit to Ethiopia will help
increase the mutual understanding between the two countries and
raise the traditional friendly relations and cooperation up to a
new level.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is currently on a six-nation tour in Africa, said:
"I have been looking forward to visiting Africa and seeing with
my own eyes the progress and development Africa has scored. I am
very happy to have this opportunity to visit Africa and
Ethiopia."
</P>
<P>
Negasso described Jiang's trip as a "historic visit" and
"another landmark" in the history of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, Ethiopia's Prime Minister Meles Zenawi paid a visit
to China, President Negasso recalled.
</P>
<P>
Negasso noted that Ethiopia and China share many things in common
and there is a solid basis for the two countries to develop their
friendly relations and cooperation.

<P>
HONG KONG, May 11 (Xinhua) -- China and Malaysia became the
first two of the 12 teams of the coming Thomas and Uber Cup Finals
 badminton tournament to arrive in Hong Kong Saturday.
</P>
<P>
With world number one Ye Zhaoying leading the 10-player entry,
the Chinese women's team is tipped to win back the trophy it lost
two years ago in the world team championships.
</P>
<P>
Also in the women's team are Han Jingna, now ranked sixth in
the world, Wang Chen, ranked eighth and Zhang Ning, ninth.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese men's side features such stars as world No. 1 Dong
Jiong and the team's manager Zhou Jincan was optimistic about the
team reaching the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
With his recent wins in three major tournaments, Dong rocketed
recently to the world's top spot from the fourth position as he
was ranked last month by the International Badminton Federation.
</P>
<P>
"Everything was all right as we traveled all the way from
Beijing down here. The players are now in good shape," said Li
Yongbo, the team's head coach.
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing for us is to get used to the courts
and be in top form as soon as possible," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese teams are set for their first training session here
Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
Since Malaysia had not qualified for the Uber Cup final, only
its men's team arrived for the Thomas Cup competition.
</P>
<P>
"This would be the last chance for everyone before the Olympic
Games in Atlanta to see the world's top players in action," said
Rashid Sidek, Malaysia's playing coach for the men's team.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysians, who last won the Thomas Cup in 1992, have been
training at home since February this year.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Iraq Tries to Boost Grain Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has urged its governmental
departments concerned to take all necessary measures for a boost
in its grain production to ease acute shortage of food supply as a
result of the over five-year United nations trade sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein recently gave instructions that
the ministries of agriculture and trade take emergency measures
to do a good job in the summer harvest and encourage local
farmers to sell as much as possible their farm produce to the
state.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi Ministry of Trade has announced that the government
will purchase grain at the same price as in the previous year
despite a recent surge in Iraqi dinar (ID). Last year the state
offered the price for one ton of barley at 60,000 ID from farmers
and one ton of wheat at 150,000 ID (88 U.S. dollars) which are
currently equal to 150 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the trade ministry has banned grain sale in the
black market. Those who violate the regulation will be fined or
put into prison. Grain traders in Baghdad deem that local farmers
will not risk the possible fine and imprisonment for illegal
grain sale since the state offers higher purchasing price than
that in the black market.
</P>
<P>
At a special cabinet meeting devoted to the discussion of the
grain harvest this year, the Iraqi government is determined to
draw the grain into the state storage in a shortest possible
time.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture ministry called upon all social sectors to
invest in the farm field in an effort to be self-sufficient in
grain supply. It also called for the use of all farm machinery in
the current harvesting season and give reward to those who
contribute to the grain harvest.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has planned to extend cultivation areas, promote
the study of agricultural science and resolve the problem in the
supply of seeds and pesticides.
</P>
<P>
In response to instructions of President Saddam Hussein, Iraqi
officials in groups are currently in 12 provinces in the south
and central part of the country to supervise the ongoing
harvesting. The official media also give wide coverage of the
progress in summer harvesting.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. clamped comprehensive sanctions on Iraq for its 1990
invasion of Kuwait, which has left the Iraqi people suffering from
severe shortage in food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
Since the imposition of the trade embargo, the Iraqi government
has provided its individual citizens with a rationing system, each
month one having seven kilograms of flour and a limited amount of
rice, edible oil, sugar and tea at a give-away prices. The
rationing has played an important role in the daily life of
ordinary Iraqis, which ensures to a great extent the stability of
the country.
</P>
<P>
according to the U.N. statistics, the grain output of Iraq
last year was 1.5 million tonnes which could only meet the needs
of one-third of its 20 million population. In addition to its
internal grain output, Iraq, with an annual consumption of 4
million tonnes of grain, must import at least an extra 2 million
tonnes of grain this year for its sanctions-hit people.
</P>
<P>
Iraqis pin high hope on a success in the ongoing fourth round
of oil-for-food talks on a U.N. offer enabling Iraq to sell 2
billion U.S. dollars of oil every six months to buy food and other
supplies, but the prospects for the talks remain
uncertain. Undoubtedly, the Iraqis will face a much more difficult
situation if the talks fail. Under such severe circumstances the
Iraqi government is under pressure for a boost in its grain
production.
</P>
<P>
As the U.N. sanctions continue, the Iraqi government has in
recent years become more and more aware that top priority should
be given to the development of its agriculture to ensure a

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Museveni Re-elected Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Uganda Interim
Electoral Commission Stephen Akabway announced here this evening
that Mr. Yoweri Museveni has won the country's first direct
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Museveni has got 4,428,190 of entire registered votes, a
landslide majority of 74.2 percent of the total valid votes,
accoridng to the commission chairman.
</P>
<P>
Candidate Paul Ssemogerere has 1,416,139 votes, accounting for
23.7 percent of the total. Another candidate Mohammed Mayanja
receives 123,290 votes, 2.1 percent of the electorate, said
Akahway.
</P>
<P>
A major reason for Museveni's victory is that the voters want
peace after protracted political turmoil in the country.
</P>
<P>
Since the government led by Museveni came to power in 1986,
peace, stability and economic recovery has been gaining power to
remove the lingering fear of the warfare between the 1970s and
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Over 700,000 Ugandan refugees have returned home from foreign
countries since 1986. Almost a similar number of the internally
displaced have resettled either in their former homes or in new
places.
</P>
<P>
The general picture is that more than seven percent of the
country's population has since 1986 terminated their refugee
life.
</P>
<P>
With peace and security preveiling in most parts of the
country, even Museveni's rivals have to admit the effective
performance of his governance.
</P>
<P>
It is natural for voters to think and hope that Museveni can
continuously give them peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
A pre-election national poll showed that 75 percent of 1,700
randomly selected Ugandans held Museveni could keep in chech the
army, which used to terrorize the people.
</P>
<P>
Voters'support also comes from the achievements made under
Museveni in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
They believe that Uganda will have another chance to a quick
economic growth if Museveni's reform policy remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
As shown by official statistics, the country's gross domestic
product (GDP) has grown at an annual rate of 6.5 percent since
the launching of economic recovery program in May, 1987.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the GDP growth in Uganda's 1984/85 financial year
was an insignificant 0.2 percent, as compared with the striking
figure of 10 percent for the 1994/95 financial year, a highest in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The country saw its foreign exchange reserves increase from
23.1 million U.S. Dollars in June 1991 to 468 million Dollars by
the end of December 1995.
</P>
<P>
The steady and obvious economic growth impressed the Paris
Club so much that it in 1995 pledged 800 million Dollars in
financial aid to Uganda's economy in its 1995/96 financial year.
</P>
<P>
The result was the voice of support whenever Museveni appeared
at mass rallies during his election campaign.
</P>
<P>
"Museveni, no change!" was a common slogan shouted by his
audience.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 11 (Xinhua)-- President Negasso expressed
the belief that Jiang's visit will make contributions to the
strengthening of the close cooperation between Ethiopia and
China.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Negasso's remarks on bilateral relations, Jiang said
China is satisfied with the smooth growth of such relations and
the steady expansion of bilateral cooperation since Ethiopia's
transitional government came into power.
</P>
<P>
China appreciates that the Ethiopian government attaches
importance to relations with China and sticks to the "one China"
position, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He commented that China and Ethiopia share views on major
international issues and have maintained close cooperation in the
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Briefing Jiang on his country's domestic situation, Negasso
said Ethiopia has entered a period of peace and stability and is
now focusing on economic development.
</P>
<P>
He said Ethiopia needs not only domestic peace but a stable
regional situation, therefore it is striving for developing
friendly ties with all countries on an equal basis.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China is happy to see Ethiopia, after the end of
its civil war, has scored satisfactory results in maintaining
peace and stability and reviving its economy by formulating a new
federal system and implementing its five-year program of peace,
democracy and development.
</P>
<P>
He also praised President Negasso for making important
contributions to maintaining peace and keeping everything smooth
sailing during the transitional period.

<HEADLINE> Another UK Farmer Commits Suicide over BSE Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- A British farmer Bill Rodney, who
faced with having to destroy his cattle under the Government's
emergency measures to overcome the BSE crisis, killed himself,
according to reports here today.
</P>
<P>
Rodney was a farmer in North Yorks and his herd had already
been clear of BSE. But he feared that his animals were doomed to
destruction as they had reached the age of 30 months, when they
were liable to be slaughtered under the government's emergency
measures.
</P>
<P>
The 49-year-old was considered a good and honest farmer, who
was married with three teenage children, and was discovered dead
with shotgun wounds in his head on Thursday in his farmyard.
</P>
<P>
The previous day, Rodney had handed in his subsidy claim form
to the Ministry of Agriculture and then he went to the market,
where he found that cattle similar to his own were fetching half
of their normal price.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that his family blamed the beef crisis over his
death.
</P>
<P>
Rodney is the second British farmer committing suicide since
the eruption of BSE crisis in March.
</P>
<P>
On April 14, a farmer John Capp in Lincolnshire was found dead
from carbon monoxide.
</P>
<P>
His friends said that the beef crisis had "tipped him over the
edge" and that he had been unable to sell any of his 200 cattle
since the BSE scare started.
</P>
<P>
Auctioneer Paul Gentry, who sold cows for Capp at the cattle
market, said that Capp had hundreds of thousands of pounds tied up
in beef and financial ruin.
</P>
<P>
The British government now faced complains from farmers and the
meat industry about its scheme to slaughter cattle aged over 30
months in response to the European Union's worldwide ban on
British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
The government launched the scheme on May 3. Last week, with
3,321 cattle killed.

<HEADLINE> British PM Rules Out Referendum on Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
has reaffirmed his strong opposition to a federal Europe, but he
also ruled out the need to hold a national referendum on the
country's European policy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Tory Scottish conference this afternoon, Major
said, "Britain must be a part of Europe, but a Europe of nations,
not a united states of Europe and a federal Europe."
</P>
<P>
"We don't need a referendum to know we don't want a centralized
Europe," he told his party members.
</P>
<P>
The British government announced earlier this year that it
would call a national referendum on the country's membership of
the European Monetary Union (EMU), if the British Parliament
decided to take the country into the EMU.
</P>
<P>
The anti-European tide is gathering more and more momentum
recently across the country, as the EU Commission refused to lift
the world-wide ban on British beef products exports.
</P>
<P>
A group of Tory Euro-sceptics are campaigning to stage a
national referendum on all the principal guidelines of the
country's European policy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher also
reportedly voiced her strong opposition to a centralized Europe,
saying that a single European state is a "nightmare".
</P>
<P>
She made it clear that a federal Europe would assume
independence and become a rival to the United States and Europe's
"feebleness" in the former Yugoslavia had pinpointed shortcomings
of EU policies.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Muslims Confess killing Serb Civilians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Muslims who were captured
near the Serb town of Zvornik on Friday confessed they had killed
four Serb civilians from the eastern Bosnian village of Milici on
May 2, the Serb news agency SRNA reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted a statement of the Zvornik public security
center as saying that the terrorists, Ahmo Harbas, Behudin Husic
and Nedzad Hasic committed the murder, while their accomplices
Enver Harbas, Vahdet Avdic, Mujo Mehic and Muharem Hasanovic
helped drag the bodies to a pit and cover them with earth.
</P>
<P>
According the SRNA, the detained Muslims confessed that the
Serb civilians were killed in the village of Stublic and
transported to the adjacent village of Krusev where they were
buried in an old Muslim cemetery.
</P>
<P>
Zvornik public security center teams are investigating the
terrorists' claims on the spot, SRNA said and added that
pathologists from Belgrade's Military Academy of Medicine were
expected to arrive soon in Zvornik, the Serb town in eastern
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
All suspected Muslim killers were from the former Muslim
enclave of Srebrenica which was seized by the Serb army in July
1995 and later belongs to the Republika Srpska under the Dayton
agreement reached in November of last year.

ADDIS ABABA, May 11 (Xinhua)-- During the talks, Jiang briefed
Negasso on China's economic situation, the ninth five-year plan
and the long-term objectives for the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
"I have a strong feeling that China and African nations face
the same tasks and goals," Jiang said, adding that he hopes China
and Africa strengthen economic cooperation and expand trade ties
in an effort to seek common development.
</P>
<P>
Negasso said China, by implementing the policy of reforms and
opening to the outside world, has successfully achieved social
stability and economic growth. China has also relied on its own
to feed its 1.2 billion people, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said China's experiences in this regard can benefit
Ethiopia and all developing countries. He expressed the hope that
China joins Ethiopia's economic constructions.
</P>
<P>
Negasso went on to say that developing countries need to
maintain stability and oppose external interference in their
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Based on this principle, he stressed, Ethiopia understands and
supports China's policy of opposing external interference and
will always be a reliable friend of China.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China has always pursued an independent foreign
policy of peace. China appreciates Ethiopia's independent and
non-aligned foreign policy and its efforts in actively
participating in international and regional affairs, he added.
</P>
<P>
As Chairman of the Organization of African Unity, Jiang noted,
Ethiopia has played an important role in promoting African
development and political settlement of regional conflicts.
</P>

successful and that they have reached concensus on many issues of
concern.

<HEADLINE> Fish, Shrimp Stocks in Gulf Decline: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Fishery resources in the Gulf
have declined in recent years, an expert from the Kuwait Institute
for Scientific Research (KISR) said here today.
</P>
<P>
Abdelhadi Al-Otaibi, director general of the institute, said
in an inaugural speech on the "Workshop on Shrimp and Demersal
Fishes" that indicators show that shrimp and fish stocks are
continuously declining due to overfishing and increased
environmental degradation.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that fish is an important food resource in the Gulf
nations and that fish catches constitute an essential element of
the national economies of the region's countries, Al-Otaibi said
"the threat facing fish stocks in the region was due to the
increase in human activities such as overfishing that has been
caused by disregarding regulations and fishing bans, enforced to
protect this natural resource."
</P>
<P>
He called on the Gulf countries to commit themselves to
maintenance and conservation of fish stocks in the Gulf which he
said "was vital and important for all the region's countries,
particularly, since fish ad shrimp stocks recognize no political
boundaries."
</P>
<P>
He also called for cooperation among the region's nations to
protect fishery resources in order to ensure "optimum benefits
for all."
</P>
<P>
The workshop which will last for three days is organized by the
KISK in cooperation with the U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Museveni Wins Ugandan Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Meanwhile, the other two
candidates are not strong enough to defeat Museveni in the
elections. Paul Ssemogerere, presidential candidate for his
Democratic Party (DP) and the Uganda People's Congress (UPO),
though he has been an old stateman for about 30 years, the party
he represented has'nt made an outstanding contribution to the
country as that of Museveni. Ssemogerere's commitment to the
right to federalism and multiparty democracy, major point
different from that of Museveni, had already voted down during
the constitution making process last year.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, his cooperation with UPC in the campaign for
presidency has even been opposed by some of diehards of his
party, who held that the cooperation will lead the country to a
new disaster, becuase the chaos between 1980 and 1985 when UPC
ruled the country remains fresh in their minds.
</P>
<P>
Another presidential candidate, Mohammed Kibirige Mayanja, an
independent economist, is little known by his fellow countrymen.
</P>
<P>
He is said to be supported by Muslins who constitute only
eight percent of the country's population. Modern African histroy
shows that it is impossible for a person without party affliation
as tribal oasis to be elected as a president of a nation.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, most of the donor countries support Museveni to have
another five years to rule the country. They have tried to
persuated Museveni's opponents to give him another chance.
</P>
<P>
Obeservers said that If the new Ugandan government led by
Museveni continues to carry out non-party democracy and take
effective measures to combat corruption, while going ahead with
the Economic Recovery Program, the current situation of political
stability and economic development in the country will be
maintained.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
and his Ethiopian counterpart Negasso Gidada pledged here today
to make continued efforts to promote cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents made the pledge at a banquet held at the
National Palace here by Negasso in honor of Jiang and his
entourage.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Negasso lauded Jiang's visit to Enthiopia as a
landmark event in the relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang flew here this morning for a three-day state visit to
Ethiopia to consolidate friendship and promote cooperation
between China and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
"Your visit to Ethiopia is historic for many reasons," Negasso
noted, saying that it is the first ever visit by a Chinese
president to Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
He said that Ethiopia attaches great importance to its
relations with China, and the Ethiopian people hold the people of
China in very high esteem.
</P>
<P>
"Contacts between the two peoples go back into history," he
said. "Since diplomatic relations were established between our
two countries in the early seventies, the role of Chinese experts
in Ethiopia have been very laudable and the various projects
completed with Chinese cooperation have been indeed extremely
helpful."
</P>
<P>
"We wish to consolidate these relations with your country and
with your great people," Negasso said. "We are very much aware
how much your country is committed to its relations with all
developing countries and how determined you are to promote
equality among all sovereign nations."
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Jiang spoke highly of Ethiopia's time-honored
civilization and its long-time struggle against foreign
aggressors.
</P>
<P>
He said that in this century, Ethiopia has made outstanding
contributions to African struggle for independence and to the
establishment of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
"The government and people of Ethiopia have scored remarkable
successes in maintaining stability, developing economy and
improving people's livelihood," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader expressed his confidence that Ethiopia will
make even greater achievements in its search for a development
path suited to its own national conditions.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also praised the role Ethiopia has played in seeking
political settlement of regional conflicts and promoting regional
cooperation and development.
</P>
<P>
"Our exchanges and cooperation in various fields have grown
constantly closer and broader since the Ethiopian People's
Revolutionary Democratic Front came to power," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China is ready to join Ethiopia in steadily
strengthening bilateral cooperation in international affairs and
exploring new areas and new approaches of cooperation on the
basis of equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
"With the concerted efforts and meticulous nurturing by the
two sides, the flowers of Sino-Ethiopian friendship will bloom
even more luxuriantly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Attending the banquet were more than 130 officials from both
sides, including Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen and Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin.
</P>
<P>
This afternoon, Jiang laid a wreath to the Victory Monument in
the Ethiopian capital with the accompany of Negasso and five
Ethiopian government ministers.
</P>
<P>
This is the second leg of Jiang's ongoing African tour, which
has taken him to Kenya.

Electoral Commission Stephen Akabway announced here this evening
that Mr. Yoweri Museveni has won the country's first direct
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Museveni has got 4,428,190 of entire registered votes, a
landslide majority of 74.2 percent of the total valid votes,
accoridng to the commission chairman.
</P>
<P>
Candidate Paul Ssemogerere has 1,416,139 votes, accounting for
23.7 percent of the total. Another candidate Mohammed Mayanja
receives 123,290 votes, 2.1 percent of the electorate, said
Akahway.
</P>
<P>
A major reason for Museveni's victory is that the voters want
peace after protracted political turmoil in the country.
</P>
<P>
Since the government led by Museveni came to power in 1986,
peace, stability and economic recovery has been gaining power to
remove the lingering fear of the warfare between the 1970s and
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Over 700,000 Ugandan refugees have returned home from foreign
countries since 1986. Almost a similar number of the internally
displaced have resettled either in their former homes or in new
places.
</P>
<P>
The general picture is that more than seven percent of the
country's population has since 1986 terminated their refugee
life.
</P>
<P>
With peace and security preveiling in most parts of the
country, even Museveni's rivals have to admit the effective
performance of his governance.
</P>
<P>
It is natural for voters to think and hope that Museveni can
continuously give them peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
A pre-election national poll showed that 75 percent of 1,700
randomly selected Ugandans held Museveni could keep in chech the
army, which used to terrorize the people.
</P>
<P>
Voters'support also comes from the achievements made under
Museveni in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
They believe that Uganda will have another chance to a quick
economic growth if Museveni's reform policy remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
As shown by official statistics, the country's gross domestic
product (GDP) has grown at an annual rate of 6.5 percent since
the launching of economic recovery program in May, 1987.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the GDP growth in Uganda's 1984/85 financial year
was an insignificant 0.2 percent, as compared with the striking
figure of 10 percent for the 1994/95 financial year, a highest in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The country saw its foreign exchange reserves increase from
23.1 million U.S. Dollars in June 1991 to 468 million Dollars by
the end of December 1995.
</P>
<P>
The steady and obvious economic growth impressed the Paris
Club so much that it in 1995 pledged 800 million Dollars in
financial aid to Uganda's economy in its 1995/96 financial year,
surpassing the figure the east African country required.
</P>
<P>
The result was the voice of support whenever Museveni appeared
at mass rallies during his election campaign.
</P>
<P>
"Museveni, no change!" was a common slogan shouted by his
audience.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Government Urged To Assist War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe National Liberation War
Veterans Association (ZNLWVA) today urged the government to assist
all the 75,000 war veterans who were injured during the struggle for
independence.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the association Chemjerai Munzvi said that most war
veterans were destitute because of the slow pace of processing
compensation applications.
</P>
<P>
"We need over 1 billion Zimbabwe Dollars (100 million U.S.
Dollars) for all the war veterans to be sufficiently compensated and
the ministry responsible must create schemes to help get the victims
of the liberation struggle established," he said.
</P>
<P>
So far the government has paid over 600 million Zimbabwe
Dollars (60 million U.S. Dollars) to over 40,000 claims made by
ex-combatants for various injuries and disabilities sustained
during the war.
</P>
<P>
Over 20,000 ex-combatants have also been promised land for
resettlement.
</P>
<P>
In the 1995/96 budget, the government allocated 221 million
Zimbabwse Dollars (22.1 million U.S. Dollars) for the
compensation of war veterans.
</P>
<P>
A senior official in the Ministry of Public Service, Labour and
Social Welfare said the momey had already run out and the social
welfare office had temporarily suspended the payment of compensation
until money became available.

suffered this year's first defeat when they went down 3-2 to hosts

In the 30th minute, the visiting Shanghai cut it 2-1 when

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, Arafat, King Hussein End Tripartite Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
King Hussein of Jordan and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat ended
here today their tripartite meeting which aims at coordinating
their positions in Arab-Israeli negotiations.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference following the summit, Mubarak
emphasized the need to give impetus to peace talks on the Syrian
and Lebanese tracks, in order to complete the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We are all keen on the peace and and we have to pursue the
peace march," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said they agreed to meet again in order to cross this
critical phase and help push forward the peace march.
</P>
<P>
"There are many obstacles, but I believe that through continued
cooperation and coordination we shall pass through this phase."
</P>
<P>
The three leaders agreed on the establishment of a mechanism at
the ministerial level for coordination and cooperation among
concerned Arab parties.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein expressed support to the Palestinians' claim to
Jerusalem as the capital of their future state, but adding that
the holy sites in Jerusalem should be shared by Jews, Christians
and Moslems.
</P>
<P>
Israel seized the Arab eastern sector of Jerusalem from Jordan
in the 1967 Middle East war and declared it part of its
capital. But Palestinians want the Arab sector as the capital of
their would-be state.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein described their summit today as "frank and open,"
saying that they agreed to work as one hand, and by one heart, to
help the Palestinians realize their legitimate sovereignty and
restore their full rights to their national heritage.
</P>
<P>
"This requires coordination among us in the coming stages and
in the final phase of negotiations, and thank God, there is full
agreement on maintaining this coordination at the highest level to
achieve the aspired just and comprehensive peace," he added.
</P>
<P>
Arafat expressed thanks to Egypt and Jordan for their support
in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations for a final settlement. He
admitted there are still many obstacles in reaching an agreement.
</P>
<P>
He said the responsibilities and difficulties ahead are huge
but today's summit set the groundwork to overcome the difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Israel and the Palestinians started their talks on
such issues as the final status of Jerusalem and the fate of
Palestinian refugees, but no tangible results were achieved.
</P>
<P>
But serious talks on the issues are not expected to begin until
after Israel's general elections scheduled for May 29.
</P>
<P>
The three leaders will meet again early next month in Jordan to
continue their coordination talks.
</P>
<P>
"We met today and talked about coordination and cooperation,
and we shall meet again so that we may get across the delicate
phase and help push the peace process forward," said Mubarak at
the press conference.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Government Asked to Check Tea Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 12 (Xinhua) -- A tea business group in Nepal has
asked the government to reduce the customs duty on tea imports in
order to check tea smuggling from the neighboring India.
</P>
<P>
The recent increase in the import duty on tea from 15 percent
to 30 percent had hampered importing of tea and encouraged
smuggling, officials from the Nepal Tea Sellers and Packagers
Association said today.
</P>
<P>
The increase of tariff on tea also had led to revenue leakage
of the country, they said.
</P>
<P>
Nepal currently imports about 3,600 metric tons of tea, mostly
from India, while the total annual consumption of the country
stands at 6,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Due to the high import duty and the open border between Nepal
and India, a large quantity of tea is being smuggled to Nepal from
India, according to the association.
</P>
<P>
The tea normally costs 100 rupees (nearly 2 US dollars) one
kilogram on the Nepali market, but now it was sold at 90 rupees
one kilogram or lesser.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Government Urged To Cancel Grain Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Opposition United Parties (UP)
of Zimbabwe said on Sunday the government should cancel all grain
loans in view of the rising cost of living.
</P>
<P>
UP spokesman Isaac Manyemba said in a statement it was
illogical for the government to force people to pay back the
grain they received last year.
</P>
<P>
"It is immoral, it is illogical, if not criminal, for the
government to force the rural populace to pay back the grain they got
during the drought.
</P>
<P>
"A responsible government would take into account the high
cost of living, especially the prices of mealie-meal, transport,
medication and cancel the grain loans," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The government has already started collecting back the grain
which was lent out last year as millions of people ran out of
food because of the drought and expects to get back some 400,000
tonnes of maize.
</P>
<P>
The grain loan scheme was launched last year as the government
sought to reduce the rural people's dependence on food handouts
during droughts.
</P>
<P>
The government officials have said the repaid grain would be used
to boost the country's strategic reserve stocks which have to be
maintained at over 980,000 tonnes of maize.

KATHMANDU, May 12 (AFP) - Three Indian climbers were dead on
Sunday and four other mountaineers were still missing after
scaling Mount Qomolangma, as blizzards lashed the world's highest
mountain.
</P>
<P>
Nepal's Tourism Ministry said that four mountaineers reported
missing on Friday were still unaccounted for, although a fifth
climber had been found alive.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in New Delhi, the Indian Mountaineering Federation

descending from the peak on Friday after becoming the first Indian
team to conquer Qomolangma north face.
</P>
<P>
They were identified as inspector T. Samanla and constables
Tsewang Paljor and Dorje Morup. Their bodies were found by a group
of Japanese climbers who were on their way down.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Israeli Scientists Working to Restore Fragrance in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli scientists are working
to restore scents to flowers that have been bred out over years of
controlled genetic selection that preferred beauty and long shelf
life, reported The Jerusalem Post today.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the Hebrew University's agriculture faculty
believe that in the near future, scent can be returned to some of
the most beautiful flowers by "external treatment" and, in the
long run, via genetic engineering.
</P>
<P>
In order to have an odor, flowers or food need to contain
aromatic chemicals that spread through the nostrils and
mouth. Research has shown that many flowers have an apparatus that
connects these chemicals to the sugar molecule.
</P>
<P>
When triggered, an enzyme works to release the chemical that
creates a fresh smell. Flower breeders over the generations
apparantly have harmed the flower's ability to produce the
enzyme, but this can be restored. The aim is to use an enzyme
known to sever the link between the aromatic chemical and the
sugar molecule.
</P>
<P>
The enzyme, beta glucoxidase, is manufactured commercially from
a fungus according to a patented process developed by Dr. Oded
Shusayov and a number of his university colleagues. Originally,
he developed it to improve the taste of wine and other foods. The
problem was how to introduce the scentless odor into flowers.
</P>
<P>
They tried spraying it on flowers within minutes, the sentless
flowers started to produce an odor. Apparently, the aromatic
chemicals are found in the intercellular spaces, so the enzyme
does not have to penetrate the cells themselves. The spraying
technique has worked on a variety of commercially grown species.
</P>
<P>
The more difficult approach is genetic engineering, which would
naturally restore the flower's ability to produce scents without
outside intervention. The gene that is coded for the enzyme has
been isolated. The researchers can produce the enzyme in bacteria
instead of a fungus, thus the quantities produced are considerably
larger.
</P>
<P>
In the next stage, they hope to produce transgenic plants with
the gene. The flowers will then produce a scent but preserve their
characteristic beauty and long shelf life.
</P>
<P>
It will be several years before such plants are available on
the commercial market. Large international flower cultivators and
perfume manufacturers, as well as researchers abroad, have
expressed much interest in the university scientists'
work.

LONDON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- A secret, illegal workforce of
children is being employed in Britain as street traders, waiters,
gardeners and shop assistants, the "Independent on Sunday"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
An extensive survey into child labor carried out in Britain
shows that at some secondary schools nearly three-quarters of
pupils under 16 have jobs.
</P>
<P>
"Many work in the early hours before dawn, or late at
night. Some are as young as seven," according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
A report to be published by a team of academics from the
University of Paisley estimates that, nationally, between 1.1
million and 1.7 million pupils in the 11-15 age group now have a
job. "Nine out of 10 children work illegally and their average pay
is 1.5 pound (about two U.S. dollars) an hour."
</P>
<P>
The academics warn that working excessive hours adversely
affects the children's education. They also say there is
widespread confusion over the law and inadequate policing of child
workers.

XI'AN, May 12 (Xinhua) -- 1,500 farmers in Xi'an took the exam
today with the dream of working for the local government.
</P>
<P>
The capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province is the first
Chinese city to seek civil servants from local peasants.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that the civil servant system has become popular
not only at the central government and provincial level, but at
the prefecture, county, and township level as well.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the current exam system allows farmers to
apply, regardless of what they do or where they are.
</P>
<P>
The local offices at township and village level in the local
six counties have 137 positions open, for which there have been
2,500 applicants.
</P>
<P>
The local personnel department said this move has given rural
youths a chance to show their ability, and will be conducive to
the stability and democracy of the countryside.
</P>
<P>
Becoming civil servants has long been many Chinese farmers'
dream because of the stable salary and relately high social
status.

<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Gansu province, on the upper
reaches of the Yellow River, has had great success in controlling
soil erosion over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Afforestation, planting grass, and building terraced fields
have helped control 40 percent of the eroded regions.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River Valley covers 145,000 square kilometers in the
province, 72 percent of which suffered from soil erosion. The
province's silt discharge into the Yellow River accounted for 30
percent of the river's total and impaired grain production in the
area and caused life to be hard for the 13.5 million residents
there.
</P>
<P>
To improve the economy of the river valley and living standards
there, the local government adopted measures to control erosion
over the past several years.
</P>
<P>
Terracing fields is considered a key measure to maintain steady
grain increases, and 1.17 million ha of terraced fields have been
built, increasing grain output by 950 million kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The local government had a comprehensive harnessing project in
small river valleys, controlling 8,879 square kilometers of eroed
areas in this way. Per capita grain production and per capita
income in small river valleys was 65 percent and 157 percent more
respectively than five years ago.
</P>
<P>
the local government has also improved its supervisory system
to help curb soil erosion.

</P>
<P>
He said, "Being one of the world's major sugar exporters, the
Philippines was a signatory to the previous international sugar
agreements."
</P>
<P>
However, it withdrew from the ISO in 1991 due to disagreement
on the amount of Philippine annual membership dues," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Since then the Philippines has been attending ISO
meetings, conferences, and seminars only on an observer status."
</P>
<P>
With the reduction in the amount of Philippine membership dues
and taking into account the role the ISO will play as advisory
body to the World Trade Organization, leaders of the country's
sugar industry strongly recommended Manila's accession to the 1992
agreement to pave the way for its re-entry to the ISO.

largest foreign trade partner.
</P>
<P>
Headed by Chief Secretary Anson Chan, the delegation comprises
a dozen of Hong Kong's top businessmen and senior government

</P>
<P>
Known as "Hong Kong-USA 1996", the nine-day promotion

</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said that the promotion was to enhance
the overseas understanding of Hong Kong and of the business
opportunities Hong Kong can offer as a gateway to China and other
Asia Pacific economies. He believed that the events will
strengthen the traditional economic ties between the territory and
its second largest trading partner.

Orchestra and an exhibition showing diversified life in Hong Kong
will add more color to the US tour. Film festivals will show
American cinema-goers nine Hong Kong movies.
</P>
<P>
The trip to the Untied States is part of a continuing effort to
publicize Hong Kong overseas, with one country selected each year,
according to the government spokesman. Similar promotion programs

BAGHDAD, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today protested to Turkey over
the violation of the Iraqi territorial sovereignty and air space
by launching military operations against kurdish separatists in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A strongly-worded memorandum handed over to the Turkish Charge
D'Affaires in Baghdad by the Iraqi Foreign Ministry said that the
Turkish military action taken on Monday in northern Iraq under the
pretext of chasing Kurdish rebels constitutes a flagrant breach of
principles of international law, provisions of the U.N. Charter
and relations of good neighborliness.
</P>
<P>
Iraq demanded the immediate withdrawal of the Turkish forces
and a halt to such violations. It also asserted its legitimate
right to ask for compensation for the damages caused by Turkey to
Iraqi Kurds in the northern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for Turkish forces to make a cross-
border attack against rebel Kurds since the beginning of
this year. The attack has left a number of casualties.

<HEADLINE> China Attaches Importance To Sino-Ethiopian Ties: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President
Jiang Zemin said here today that the Chinese government attaches
importance to the friendship and cooperation with Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to make joint efforts with Ethiopia in seeking
for long-term, stable, equal and sustained development of bilateral
relations, Jiang said in his talks with Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi.
</P>
<P>
Jiang described Ethiopia, where the headquarters of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) is located, as an important
country in Africa.
</P>
<P>
He added that China and Ethiopia share views on major
international issues and have maintained close cooperation in
international affairs. He said it is in the interests of both
sides to further enhance their cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that Sino-Ethiopian relations have been growing
smoothly in recent years as the cooperation between the two
countries in political, economic and other fields are expanding
constantly.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Ethiopian relations are built on the basis of the Five
Principles of Peaceful Co-existence and characterized by mutual
understanding, mutual respect and mutual support, he commented.
</P>
<P>
Meles, who visited China last October, said there is a solid
basis for Ethiopian-Chinese relations, adding that there is no
obstacles in developing such ties.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia respects China's policy of developing state-to-state
relations according to the Five Principles of Peaceful
Co-existence and opposes any interference in other country's
internal affairs under the pretence of human rights or democracy.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said Ethiopia attaches importance to the
investment and trade ties with China. He said that the economic
cooperation between Ethiopia and China has been successful but
there is still big room for further expansion.
</P>
<P>
He said Ethiopia welcomes more Chinese enterprises to invest in
Ethiopia and participate in his country's economic construction.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told Meles that the Chinese government will encourage more
Chinese companies and enterprises to conduct multi-form economic
cooperation in Ethiopia.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 12 (Xinhua) -- In a significant move to keep the
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) from power, India's ruling Congress
Party today decided to Support a government of the National-Left
Front (NF-LF) combine from outside.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Congress appeared to have kept the issue of the
party's leadership open.
</P>
<P>
The decision, which put an end to days of speculation over
which party will form a new government, was made by Congress'
Working Committee (CWC), the party's supreme decision-making body,
after a three-and-half hour meeting here today, the Press Trust of
India reported.
</P>
<P>
Industry Minister and senior Congress Party leader K.
Karunakaran, who revealed the decision to reporters, said, "We
have decided to support the NF-LF in forming a government from
outside."
</P>
<P>
As results of vote counting trickle in, a hung parliament is
becoming inevitable. The BJP and the NF-LF, which comprises
mainly the Janata Dal and left parties such as the Communist Party
of India (Marxist), have staked rival claims to form the new
government.
</P>
<P>
The Congress Party, while having suffered an unprecedented
debacle in the current general elections, plays a decisive role in
the game.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of leadership of the Congress Parliamentary Party
(CPP), Karunakaran said only, "Wait till 18:00 hours," referring
to the scheduled time for the CPP meeting to elect a new leader of
the congress party's Parliamentary Group. There is likely to be a
contest for the leadership in the coming CPP meeting.
</P>
<P>
Caretaker Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao was the CPP leader
in the dissolved 10th Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament).

<HEADLINE> China, Africa Bound to Stand Together: Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
here today that China deems the relations with Africa as very special
ties of sharing and standing together through thick and thin.
</P>
<P>
During talks with Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, Jiang
said that China, under the new international situation, is ready
to further strengthen unity and cooperation with African nations
by continuously injecting new contents into China-Africa
relations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang added that a purpose of his current visit to Africa is
to assure the governments and peoples of Africa of the
above-mentioned position.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese head of state said that to consolidate and develop
friendly cooperation with Africa constitutes an important part of
China's independent foreign policy of peace.
</P>
<P>
China has always respected the African nations' choices of
their political systems and development model according to their
own conditions and never interfered in their internal affairs;
China is also against the practice that other countries impose
their own ideology and social development model on African
nations, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"We firmly support the just struggle of African nations in
safeguarding national independence, sovereignty and territorial
integrity and in opposing external interferences. We also support
their efforts in participating in international affairs and
safeguarding their own legitimate rights and interests," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are deeply concerned about the conflicts and disputes
among African countries and hope that the countries concerned
strengthen consultations and cooperation in order to create
favorable conditions for their respective economic construction
and regional cooperation," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said China is willing to conduct exchanges
and cooperation in various aspects with Africa in order to learn
from each other and to consolidate the China-Africa ties of
"equality, sincerity, friendship and common development."
</P>
<P>
Despite the difficulties they face, Jiang noted, African
countries will realize the goals of development and vitalization
as long as they value and maintain peace and enhance unity and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Meles said Ethiopia has been following closely on the situation
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Facing external pressure, he said, it is not easy for African
nations to maintain their independence. He added that foreign
countries often attach many conditions when they grant
assistances to Africa.
</P>
<P>
Under such complicated circumstances, the prime minister said,
the Ethiopian government pursues an independent foreign policy of
peace and development and has adopted its own way of development. He
noted that the current economic policy of Ethiopia has been
successful.
</P>
<P>
Jiang praised the foreign policy of Ethiopia. He said Ethiopia
has for a long time strived for the development of Africa and the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), thus having won esteem from
African countries and the international community.
</P>
<P>
China appreciates the efforts of Ethiopia in developing friendly
relations with its neighbors on the basis of mutual respect and
mutual non-interference and China supports Ethiopia's efforts in
seeking for regional peace and security, Jiang added.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Employers to Pay Annual Fee for Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Employers in Kuwait will have
to pay 100 Kuwait Dinar (330 U.S. dollars) annual charge for each
of the foreign employees under a new labor law, which is expected
to come into effect before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the local English newspaper Arab Times
published today, Kuwaiti Minister of Social Affairs and Labour
Ahmed Khalid al-Klaib published said, "We hope that this proposed
annual fee on foreign laborers will be in place before September
this year."
</P>
<P>
The fee will be paid by employers, not by employees, and will
make a 60-fold increase in the ministry's revenue, the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
The paper said this measure is a part of a basket project of
Labor Law amendment being considered by the government aiming at
lifting partial ban on foreign recruitment "for all" which has
been implementing in the past two years in the country.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the Kuwait government imposed a partial ban on
the issuance of work permits in an effort to check the sharp
increase of foreign manpower. The ban has effectively contributed
to amending the structure of the labor market, especially that of
skilled and non-skilled workers, and the numbers of the foreign
labors have been maintained over the two-year period.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, Kuwait presently has over
600,000 foreign laborers in the private sector alone as the door
was kept open for 13 sectors like private schools, clinics,
hospitals, the press and others. Some 510,000 of them belong to
seven nationalities while 91,000 come from 132 other nationalities.
</P>
<P>
The minister said in the interview that "we are planning to
change the nationality structure by reducing some nationalities
while increasing others."
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry is considering opening up the issuance of
work permits for all, and expects the project to be completed
before the end of this year. The new Labor Law is expected to be
passed freely as there is no one in the country blocking it, he
said optimistically.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Two Israeli Soldiers Wounded in Lebanese Guerrilla Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli soldiers were wounded
this morning in the Lebanese anti-Israeli guerrilla attack against
an Israeli position in Jezzine area in the so-called security
zone, according to security sources.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas launched the attack, the first attack at the
Israeli occupation forces in south Lebanon since the April 26
cease-fire understanding was reached, at 8:30 a.m. (05:30 GMT),
the security sources said.
</P>
<P>
They fired artilleries at the position at the beginning and
then launched a ground attack in which machine-guns and rockets
were used.
</P>
<P>
The fierce fighting lasted some 15 minutes, the sources noted.
</P>
<P>
After the fighting erupted, Israeli jet fighters and
helicopters flew to the area and hovered over the site. Then,
the Israeli forces in the buffer zone intensively shelled the
heights of Iglim Al-Toffah, a place often used by Moslem
guerrillas as a springboard to launch attacks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Islamic Resistance, the military wing of the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, announced that its
fighters ambushed an Israeli patrol near the Israeli position of
Sejoud this morning.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas fired machine-guns and rockets at the patrol
when it fell in the ambush, the Islamic Resistance said in a
statement, adding that an Israeli tank and another military
vehicle were destroyed and all the Israeli soldiers inside were
killed or wounded.
</P>
<P>
The Shiite militant organization also announced that another
group of its guerrillas ambushed a second Israeli patrol in the
same area, killing and wounding several elements of the patrol.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah guerrillas mounted several attacks at the
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia in the past two weeks
and caused casualties.
</P>
<P>
More than 160 Lebanese civilians had been killed and hundreds
of others were wounded in 16 days of Israeli military strikes in
southern Lebanon before the cease-fire understanding was reached
on April 26.
</P>
<P>
According to the understanding, a five-state committee will be
set up to monitor the cease-fire in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In their first meeting in Washington on May 10,
representatives from the United States, France, Israel, Syria and
Lebanon failed to iron out their differences on the committee's
formation and mechanism of works.

<HEADLINE> Israel Launches New Raids on South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beirut, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Israel launched new air and
artillery raids in south Lebanon today after its five soldiers
were wounded in a bomb explosion set off by Hezbollah guerrillas,
Lebanese security sources said.
</P>
<P>
The five Israeli soliders on patrol were reportedly wounded
earlier today when a roadside bomb exploded near the outpost of
Sojoud occupied by Israeli troops since 1985.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah (Party of god) claimed responsibility for the blast
which it said killed four Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
After the attack, Israeli warplanes rapidly struck back, firing
rockets into suspected Hezbollah bases in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
It was the first Israeli air raid in the embattled region since
a U.S.-brokered ceasefire ended a 17-day air, naval and artillery
blitz against the guerrillas on April 27.
</P>
<P>
The ceasefire agreement did not bar guerrilla attacks on
Israeli forces in the occupied zone, but prohibited both sides
from hitting civilians.
</P>
<P>
In the Israeli blitz, more than 160 people were killed,
mostly Lebanese civilians.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas have been fighting to drive out the 1,200
Israeli soldiers from the so-called "security zone" Israel carved
out in south Lebanon allegedly to prevent Moslem guerrillas from
attacking northern Israel.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets With Ethiopian House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
met here today with Dawit Yohannes, Ethiopia's Speaker of the
House of People's Representatives, on enhancing bilateral
relaltions and promoting cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Dawit expressed his welcome to Jiang for his visit to
Ethiopia's House of Pepole's Representatives, saying that he was
happy to discuss with Jiang bilateral ties and international
situation in the perspective of legislature.
</P>
<P>
Dawit said that five years ago, Ethiopia put an end to a
25-year-old domestic turmoil and ushered in a period of
stability, thereby laying a very good foundation for developing
its economy.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian speaker said that Ethiopia can learn from
China's experience in developing economy and conducting economic
reforms. He also said that the mutual visits by leaders of the
two countries have greatly inspired the Ethiopian House of
People's Representatives.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his willingness to establish cooperative
relations with China's National People's Congress (NPC), this, he
said, is conducive to the interests of both sides and helpful in
pushing forward the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Dawit also expressed his hope that China play a more active
role in maintaining peace and stability in Africa.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Jiang conveyed warm greetings from NPC
Chairman Qiao Shi to the two speakers of Ethiopia's House of
People's Representatives and Federal Council.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president also expressed his wishes that the
Ethiopian parliament would make greater contributions to
invigorating Ethiopia's economy and promoting development.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that China appreciates and supports the Ethiopian
policy of exploring political systems and development approaches
that fit the country's specific conditions.
</P>
<P>
He said that China, like Ethiopia, is a multi-national
country. In the past 40 years, China adopted a policy of national
equality and autonomy in minority areas, which demonstrated that
properly handling national relations is an important political
basis for guaranteeing national unity, stability and development,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who arrived here yesterday and held talks with
Ethiopian President Negasso Gidada, spoke highly of the relations
between China and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two countries hold identical views on many
issues and the exchange of views between the two countries'
leaders are conducive to further strengthening the bilateral
ties.
</P>
<P>
Dawit said he agreed with Jiang over his evaluation of the
bilateral relations, adding that Jiang's visit will lay a solid
foundation for further strengthening the relations between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to bring closer our ties with China and make the two
countries equal partners in the process of developing their
respective economies," he said.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Jiang visited Ethiopia's National Museum that
houses many relics demonstrating the colorful ancient
civilization of the country. enditem

<HEADLINE> 12 Presidents to Inaugurate Trans-Asian Railroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MASHHAD, IRAN, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Eleven foreign presidents
will join in their Iranian counterpart to inaugurate Monday a
trans-Asian railway which links landlocked Central Asian Republics
with the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
This was declared by Mahmoud Vaezi, Iranian Deputy Foreign
Minister for Europ-American Affairs, at a press conferee here
today.
</P>
<P>
Up to this moment, three presidents from Turkmenistan,
Kazakhstan and Tajikistan arrived here and were greeted by Iranian
President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani at the airport.
</P>
<P>
Among other presidents to attend the ceremony here will be
Pakistani President Farooq Leghari, Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel, Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze and
Azerbaijani President Geidar Aliyev.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the airport, Tajik President Emomali
Rakhmonov said the opening of the Mashhad-Sarakhs-Tajan railway
will be an important historical event not only to Iran but also to
other countries, the CIS countries in particular.
</P>
<P>
He said the railway is not only for economic purposes but will
also bring about close relations of the different countries in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The Mashhad-Sarakhs-Tajan railway runs at a distance of 295
kilometers, including 165 kilometers in the Iranian territory and
130 kilometers in the Turkmen soil.
</P>
<P>
The railway, which links Sarakhs to Tajan in Turkmenistan and
on to China, will allow the Central Asian countries and even
further China to access to the Persian Gulf through Iran and to
the Mediterranean through Turkey.
</P>
<P>
In Iran, this railway, which is connected to the Bafgh-Bandar
Abbas railway, runs at a total distance of 2,620 kilometers from
the Iranian-Turkmen border to the coast of the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Vaezi told Xinhua that "12 presidents, two
vice-presidents, several deputy prime ministers and a lot of
ministers, altogether 56 delegations, will participate in the
inauguration ceremony."
</P>
<P>
He said that it is an important event and the railway will
enable countries in the region to become closer politically,
culturally and economically.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the historical event has much more
political significance than economic significance. It declares
itself a success in the struggle against the U.S. international
isolation drive against Iran.
</P>
<P>
Vaezi said, "Iran is a big country and it can not be
isolated. Iran is a country that has influences in the region."
</P>
<P>
He added that "the U.S. sanction does not affect us politically
and economically. The sanction is not something new. You can go
back to 17 years ago. We decided to cut political and economic
relations with the United States. We are ready to live without the
United States."
</P>
<P>
"We have good relations with different countries in the world,
such as European countries, regional countries and Far East and
Asian countries," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 12 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan left here
today for Cairo, Egypt to attend the tripartite summit between
King Hussein, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The summit, which is seen by officials here as a significant
step toward better relations among the three parties, is expected
to tackle regional cooperation, the Palestinian-Israeli final
stage negotiations and preparations for the Middle East and North
Africa economic summit due to be held in Cairo in November.
</P>
<P>
Their discussions will mainly concentrate on ways and
appropriate mechanism to implement decisions taken by the three
leaders, said the local daily Jordan Times today.
</P>
<P>
The three sides will coordinate their policies ahead of the
final stage negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The summit will help speed up the peace talks between
Israel and Syria and Lebanon, Radio Jordan reported today.
</P>
<P>
The summit is also expected to add some "harmony" to the
Jordanian-Palestinian relationship that has become more tense in
the past few weeks, while giving more momentum to Jordanian-
Egyptian ties, which were improved by the King's visit to Egypt
and the meeting between the prime ministers of the two countries
last week.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said Hamas leaders based in Jordan were guiding anti-
Israeli attacks by Hamas activists in the occupied territories and
in the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Jordan denied the charge but played down the issue in an
obvious effort to avoid a war of words with the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Officials Accuse Iran of Masterminding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian security officials
have uncovered and foiled Iranian plots to assassinate certain
Hamas political leaders in the Gaza Strip and West bank who are
opposed to plans to carry out terrorist attacks against Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian security sources said Hamas leadership abroad
are parties to the plans which include a wave of car bombings
inside the Palestinian self-rule areas in order to embarrass the
Palestinian Authority (PA), Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
PA President Yasser Arafat has on several occasions criticized
Iran to act behind Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Its activities
include training Hamas assassins, offering funds and brainwashing
young activists. But Iran has denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
Local Hamas political leaders have been inclined to reach
conciliation with the PA and participate in the political process
by dropping violence one way or another. But its overseas
leadership have rebuffed the ideas.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the imprisoned spiritual leader of Hamas,
said in a recent interview broadcast on Israel Television that
those who know where murdered Israeli soldier Ilan Sa'don is
buried should reveal the location for humanitarian reasons.
</P>
<P>
However, Hamas militants have said they respect his demands
but would not take as an order anything he said while interviewed
by the Israeli media in an Israeli prison.
</P>
<P>
Some Hamas political leaders have recently been released from
PA jails after being arrested for nearly three months following a
spate of terrorist suicide bombing attacks in Israel in late
February and early March, killing 62 people, including the four
bombers.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President Renews War Cry On Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 12 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin Mkapa on
Saturday renewed his warning against tax evaders, saying punitive
measures were being taken to curb the problem in the country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a luncheon organised by the Aga Khan Economic
Planning Board here, the president said the government would make
tax evasion a punishable criminal offence.
</P>
<P>
He told businessmen and women at the luncheon that in many
developed countries, tax evasion was one of the most serious criminal
offences that everyone frowns upon.
</P>
<P>
"In our country tax evasion is glorified as business acumen. I
intend to use all means at my disposal to make tax evasion
punishable criminal offence," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president, however, expressed displeasure on such
development that forces the government to adopt coercive measures
against defaulters and appealed to people to reconcile themselves
to their obligations as honest citizens by paying taxes fully and
in time.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa dismissed as false claims that Tanzania had
higher tariffs compared to other countries in the region. Some
people, he said, suggested lower tariffs to boost compliance.
</P>
<P>
"I have done my own little research, which has shown that as a
matter of fact Tanzania tax rates are not significantly higher
than those of other countries in the region, indeed the rates are
quite comparable," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa told the luncheon, which was also attended by
some government officials and members of diplomatic corps, that
taxes were vital for the redistribution of wealth in society.
</P>
<P>
He stated that the government would continue to create and
improve the environment for the participation of the private
sector in national development.
</P>
<P>
The president also asked members of business community to help
the poor in the country.  enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Mayor Lu Yucheng of Beijing
stressed that a thorough investigation must be done to lay bare
the whole process of the import of US waste, Beijing Daily said
today.
</P>
<P>
Lu made the remark at the site of the garbage in a village in

"unbearable", saying, "we will spare no pains to co-operate with
the central joint investigation group in thoroughly making clear
the whole process of the foreign garbage incident."
</P>

for the convenience of the investigation while preventing the
spreading of pollution.

<HEADLINE> Large Enterprises Promote Economic Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Large enterprises have played a
key role in the industrial development in the three provinces of
northeast China in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
In the January-March period, the industrial value-added output
of Jilin, Liaoning and Heilongjiang, all major industrial bases in
China, reached 118 billion yuan, rising by 11 percent over the
same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
A group of large state-owned enterprises witnessed rapid growth
rates in the period. The No.1 auto-making company group in
Changchun, for example, achieved an output of 4.5 billion yuan, an
increase of 32.2 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Those backbone companies also obtained good economic
efficiency. A survey of 77 key state-owned enterprises in Liaoning
Province show that roughly half saw a sale-production ratio of
more than 95 percent in the period.
</P>
<P>
Local officials attributed the achievements to a faster pace of
technological upgrading, which allowed the old industrial bases to
produce a batch of new and high-quality products, thus propelling
an overall growth of the industrial sectors.
</P>
<P>
In Heilongjiang Province, for example, the newly-added output
based on technological upgrading reached 1.7 billion yuan,
accounting for 7.2 percent in the output increase of the
province.

<HEADLINE> Banharn Government in Disarray after Split Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Banharn government is in
disarray after the Palang Dharma Party (Virtue Force, PDP)
withheld its vote of confidence from Deputy Interior Minister
Suchart Tancharoen Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
The move would lead to a cabinet shakeup and may even to a
re-alignment of the coalition.
</P>
<P>
The PDP said that it could not give Suchart its vote of
confidence because the deputy Interior minister failed to refute
the opposition's accusations of a massive land grab and bank loan
scandal involving his family.
</P>
<P>
When the vote was called, Suchart received the fewest aye
votes, 204, against 154 nay votes.
</P>
<P>
Several members of Prime Minister Banharn's Chart Thai (Thai
Nation) Party and some other coalition parties have demanded the
expulsion of the PDP for its failure to toe the government line
and support Suchart, who is a key member in the Chart Thai Party.
</P>
<P>
However, the PDP has demanded a cabinet reshuffle and would
prefer to remain in the government.
</P>
<P>
Despite strong criticisms against the PDP, Banharn has yet to
take any action against the PDP. Banharn hopes to maintain a
semblance of unity among the seven parties of the coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
The PDP also has no intention to quit the government. By
abstaining on a vote for the allegedly corrupt deputy interior
minister who bore the brunt of the Opposition attacks during the
censure debate, the PDP hopes to gain more popularity in the
run-up to the Bangkok gubernatorial election in early June.
</P>
<P>
Banharn wanted to keep the PDP in the coalition for at least a
while longer because the party is still needed in the government.
</P>
<P>
Most Chart Thai members and leaders of at least two other
government parties, Prachakorn Thai and the Social Action Party,
want the PDP expelled.
</P>
<P>
It is obvious that Banharn also faces a dilemma in his
backyard.
</P>
<P>
Suchart, who is a key member of the Therd Thai faction of
Banharn's Chart Thai Party, has become a political liability to
the coalition government. The Therd Thai faction holds a crucial
one-third of the Chart Thai's total 91 seats in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Suchart has made his decision known that he would not resign
unless his faction reaches agreement with Banharn asking him to do
so.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that at least two of the seven government parties,
the New Aspiration and the Nam Thai, have made it clear that they
want Suchart out of the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Observers await to see how Prime Minister Banharn will balance
factions in his party and the coalition parties in his government.

<HEADLINE> Total Cargo Handled at Chittagong Port Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
DHAKA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Despite elongated political unrest
in Bangladesh, traffic through Chittagong port and arrival of
foreign cargo ships have registered an increase during the past 10
months of the current fiscal year ending on June.
</P>
<P>
During the period, the total cargo handled at this country's
biggest port recorded at 8.61 million metric tons (mt), up from
8.37 million mt handled during the same period of the previous
fiscal year, according to reports published here today.
</P>
<P>
During 1995-96 fiscal year (July, 1995 to April, 1996),
Chittagong port handled 1,093 vessels as against only 961 vessels
in the same period of the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that had there been no dislocation in port
activities due to political unrest, volume of traffic through
Chittagong port could have been much higher.
</P>
<P>
Port officials attributed the growth in traffic to rise in
importation of cement, edible oil and export of fertilizer and
garments.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Police Joining Hands On-line to Hit Cross-Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Police in the six member
countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN)
are joining forces on-line with a computerized information system
to hit cross-border criminals, local newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
The system, which becomes operational in September, will enable
the police in Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Thailand and Singapore to share records and intelligence on
criminals who operate on their own shores, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, the data available on the system
include profiles of criminals or crime syndicates, suspects'
photographs and fingerprints, their offenses and methods of
operation.
</P>
<P>
The multi-national system, first mooted by the six forces in
1991, will also help to track the movement of vehicles belonging
to criminals, and to trace stolen properties and even missing
persons in those countries.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN now consists of seven members, with Vietnam being the
latest to join the group last year.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Superintendent Daniel Teo, Deputy Director of the
Singapore Police Intelligence Department, was quoted as commenting
that through computerization, information-sharing among police
forces can be done with greater efficiency, as the database can be
accessed immediately.
</P>
<P>
He said the ASEAN database formed the infrastructure that will
meet the needs of police way into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"This is necessary as the world is getting smaller and more
people are traveling overseas. The database links police forces in
the region together and we will be more effective in taking on
cross-border criminals," he said.

MOSCOW, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Georgia's President Eduard
Shevardnadze today said his country and Russia are working hard to
solve the political crisis in Abkhazia, an autonomous republic in
Georgia, Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks after meeting with visiting
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov in the Georgian capital
Tbilisi today.

Shevardnadze said the two countries will work out a policy to
settle the conflict in Abkhazia before the summit of the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) on May 17, and will
decide on the future of Russian peace-keeping troops in Abkhazia.

<HEADLINE> NC Chief Vows to Regain Majority in Nepali Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 12 (Xinhua) -- President of Nepal's main ruling
Nepali Congress (NC) party Girija Prasad Koirala has vowed to
restore his party's majority in parliament and to form a majority
NC government in the country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a mass rally of party workers and supporters here
Saturday after the conclusion of the 9th NC general convention,
the newly-elected NC president called on party workers to
undertake constructive work in all 205 constituencies of the
country to secure majority in the local elections to be held
within one year.
</P>
<P>
"Then we will be able to secure an overall majority in the
parliamentary election anytime when it takes place," the
72-year-old senior NC leader said.
</P>
<P>
Koirala also told the rally that the party's just concluded
general convention had ended the differences within the party and
all its workers should move ahead unitedly.
</P>
<P>
Long-existing rivalries between two factions within the NC
party loyal to Koirala and to former party president Krishina
Prasad Bhattarai led to the Party's loss of majority control in
the parliament during the 1994 mid-term election.
</P>
<P>
In the mid-term election the NC party won 83 out of the house's
205 seats, becoming the second largest party in the parliament
following the Communist Party of Nepal (UML), which held 88 house
seats after the election.

tried to return to Miami airport. Minutes later the plane
disappeared from the tower's radar.
</P>
<P>
Rescue work is being hampered because the swampy area is
accessible only by air and airboats. Coast Guard helicopters
searched the area and found only wreckage on the surface of the
water but no sign of the plane.
</P>
<P>
Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board
were en route to the site. But Lewis Jordan, ValuJet president
said, "There's no concern that the engine is in any way suspected
at this time." There were no tapes available yet of the cockpit's
conversation with tower, he said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton said in a statement, "All Americans
join Hillary and me in offering our hopes and prayers to the
families and friends of those aboard the ValuJet that has so
tragically crashed near the Miami airport."
</P>
<P>
"Although we fear the worst, we are hoping and praying for
their safety," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
ValuJet, which began operations in October 1993, serves 26
cities in 17 states. The airline offers attractively low prices
but has experienced a series of accidents.
</P>
<P>
In January, a ValuJet DC-9 got stuck in mud at Hartsfield
Atlanta International Airport. In the same month, another ValuJet
DC-9 with 30 people on board slid into a snowbank after landing at
Dulles International Airport outside Washington, closing the
airport for nearly three hours.
</P>
<P>
A ValuJet DC-9 also skidded off an icy runway at Dulles in
January 1994, closing the airport for almost two hours.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Population Control, Need of The Hour in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 12 (Xinhua) -- For many of the Pakistanis,
especially those living in the rural areas, family planning is
probably a newfangled phrase, yet the increasingly expanding
population in this subcontinent nation has sounded a warning
against the ignorance of population control.
</P>
<P>
A recent report by the Washington-based study group, Population
Action International, has said that if the present rate of
increase in the population of Pakistan continues, Pakistan will
have more people than the United States and Indonesia by the
middle of the next century.
</P>
<P>
And experts on population here fear that Pakistan might become
the third largest country in the world in terms of population
after China and India.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, with a population of approximately 140 million at
present, is already the world's seventh most populous country.
And, according to an earlier report by the same organization,
Pakistan will rank fifth by the year 2020 when its total
population is projected to reach 262 million.
</P>
<P>
However, because of the traditional and deep-rooted modes of
thought, the need for family planning in this Muslim-dominated
developing country can hardly be emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Although increase of population in the entire Muslim world,
including those countries where Muslims are the minority, is
universal, Pakistan seems to be leading others. The present level
of its population is by any means a glaring example of the
inefficiency in population control.
</P>
<P>
In 1941, six years before Pakistan's independence, the total
population of Muslims in the whole subcontinent was less than 100
million. But now, taking the three countries of Pakistan,
Bangladesh and India together, the population of Muslims are
nearly 450 million.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani Government is now taking every possible measures
to control the population, and elaborate arrangements are being
made under the eighth five-year plan.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that there are 45,000 villages in
Pakistan with a total population of 85 million. More than 13,060
villages from amongst these have a population of 2,000 each.
</P>
<P>
Under the government plan, in every such village, an educated
married woman, who belongs to the village concerned, will be
selected and employed on contract basis to spread the message of
family planning. This scheme was also implemented in the seventh
five-year plan and now it would cover 12,000 villages where 60 to
70 percent of the people of the village live.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a total of 6,000 Family Welfare Centers covering
five percent of the rural population have been established.
</P>
<P>
Until very recently, the emphasis on family planning in
Pakistan has been on the urban side, but now the emphasis and
implementation will be on both rural and urban population
planning, according to officials from the Ministry of Population
Planning.
</P>
<P>
In the urban areas, there are now 690 Family Welfare Centers.
The number will be raised to 900 in the coming years. And more
Family Welfare Centers are expected to be established in slums and
low income areas of the cities and towns in this nation.
Meanwhile, non-governmental organizations are also doing their bit
in spreading the message of family planning.
</P>
<P>
Population control is the need of the hour in Pakistan, in view
of the alarming estimates of its population. It is imperative that
population rate and birth rate be brought down to a reasonable
extent.

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Promises Reshuffle: Deputy PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-archa has promised that he would reshuffle the Cabinet after
the May 8-10 censure debate, according to Deputy Prime Minister
Amnuay Virawan.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister said that all parties concerned agreed that
there should be some changes to the Cabinet lineup in response to
public opinion, the Nation daily today quoted the Deputy Prime
Minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Amnuay noted that Banharn promised to make cabinet changes
after the 1997 budget bill is passed by Parliament by May 25.
</P>
<P>
Amnuay, leader of the Nam Thai Party, which is one of the seven
parties making up the government, said that in the forthcoming
cabinet reshuffle, the only change in his party would be over the
position of foreign minister, because the current foreign
minister, Kasem S. Kasemsri, a non-MP, has insisted that he will
resign.
</P>
<P>
Kasem has been under inter-party pressure to resign for not
being an MP.
</P>
<P>
Suraporn Denaitangtrakul, spokesman of the New Aspiration
Party, the second largest in the government, said Saturday that
his party has made a cabinet shakeup a condition of giving the 10
censured ministers a vote of confidence.
</P>
<P>
The party would review its role if the condition was not met
before the passing of the budget bill later this month.
</P>
<P>
During the censure debate from May 8-10, as many as 10 cabinet
ministers were targeted by the Opposition.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Interior Minister Suchart Tancharoen and Finance
Minister Surakiat Sathirathai faced the most severe grilling. They
both are from Banharn's Chart Thai (Thai Nation) Party.
</P>
<P>
Banharn, in his capacity as Interior Minister, was also
targeted, but escaped grilling by calling a premature end to the
debate by exploiting the ruling parties' numerical supremacy in
the House.
</P>
<P>
Many local newspapers called the government's tactic
"shameful", "disgraceful" or "a dirty trick".

<HEADLINE> Yavlinsky Denies Alleged Union with Yeltsin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Leading economic reformer and
Russia's Yabloko Movement leader Grigory Yavlinsky has denied
President Boris Yeltsin's claim of a pre-election union for the
June presidential election.
</P>
<P>
"I have no intention or desire to join the presidential team,"
said Yavlinsky, who is running in third place in the election
race, behind Yeltsin and Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
Although Yavlinsky has a strong following among liberals, he
is generally seen as having little chance of winning the
presidency. He and Yeltsin met for talks a week ago.
</P>
<P>
"During my recent meeting with President Yeltsin, we only
discussed problems that need to be resolved," said the 44-year-old
reformer in a television interview.
</P>
<P>
"I have announced the key theses of my election platform, in
particular emphasizing the need to end the murder of people in
Chechnya."
</P>
<P>
Yavlinsky did not rule out completely the possibility of
finally throwing his support behind Yeltsin, who is facing a
strong challenge from Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov.
But he said there were policy differences between himself and
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
The president announced he was "uniting" with Yavlinsky on
Saturday while campaigning in the city of Astrakhan, the last leg
of his southern Russian tour.
</P>
<P>
He said he expected three of his rivals -- retired General
Alexander Lebed, Yavlinsky and famous eye-surgeon Svyatoslav
Fyodorov -- to join his team.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Lebed, Yavlinsky and Fyodorov united to form
an election coalition -- the so-called "third Force," or
troika. But they failed to decide on who would become the single
candidate to stand in the presidential election on June 16.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who needs more support to win his second term of
office, held "closed-door" talks with Lebed and Yavlinsky earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of his supporters in Astrakhan on
Saturday, Yeltsin stated that he did not regard his
democracy-minded and reform-minded challengers as "political
opponents."
</P>
<P>
"I have already met Lebed and Yavlinsky, I am going to meet
Fyodorov, and I think this troika will join the presidential
team," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Itar-Tass and Interfax news
agencies, the president stressed his cooperation with Lebed,
Yavlinsky and Fyodorov may take "various forms," and it is not
necessary for all of them (the troika) to remove their
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also said he was against holding television debates
with his rivals in the race, a challenge initially voiced by
Zyuganov last weekend.
</P>
<P>
"Generally speaking, many candidates for the presidential post
are now calling for debates. But there are a lot of such
candidates, while Russia has one president. If I debate with
everyone, I will be simply short of time to carry out my immediate
presidential responsibilities," Yeltsin added.

LIMA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- A rich gold seam with estimated
reserves of 16.8 million metric tons of mineral ore has been
discovered in South America's biggest gold mine in Peru.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Newmont Mining Corporation and the Peruvian company
Buenaventura have been jointly exploiting the Yanacocha gold mine
in northwest Peru for the last two years. The mine is already a
major gold producer -- output last year rose 15 per cent to 620,000
ounces.
</P>
<P>
Commercial exploitation of the new deposit could start after
1998, a company spokesman said after the completion of
infrastructure, including a power generation plant and

<HEADLINE> Thai Opposition to Lodge Another No-confidence Motion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Thai Chart Pattana (National
Development), a opposition party, decided Saturday to lodge a
no-confidence motion against the entire Bangkok administration.
</P>
<P>
Following the May 8-10 no-confidence debate fiasco, in which
all 10 cabinet ministers survived, Chart Pattana, the second
largest opposition party, resolved to table another motion against
the Cabinet next week. It wanted a debate late this month before
Parliament goes into recess.
</P>
<P>
There still are enough opposition MPs to endorse another
censure bid. A no-confidence motion needs the support of 79 MPs
and 20-day interval before it can be translated into debate in the
House of Representative.
</P>
<P>
Top Chart Pattana executives plan to meet their opposition
partners on Monday or Tuesday to discuss a renewed attempt to
censure targets who slipped through the net.
</P>
<P>
local newspaper Bangkok Post today quoted Chart Pattana
executive Chamlong Krudkuntod as saying that the debate could be
scheduled from May 27 to 29 following the first reading of the
1997 Budget Bill scheduled from May 23 to 25.
</P>
<P>
However, a source said the Democrat Party, the largest
opposition party, favored a renewed assault in the parliamentary
session that begins on July 10.

<HEADLINE> Number of Old People to Surge in Latin America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The number of old people in Latin
American and Caribbean countries is expected to quadruple to 91
million by the year 2025 -- double the rate of growth of the
overall population, a Cuban newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The population of the two regions is forecast to rise from 369
million in the 1980s to 865 million by 2025, while the number of
people aged 60 and over is expected to increase from 23.6 million
to 91 million -- up from 6.4 percent of the population in 1980s to
10.6 percent, the newspaper Granma said.
</P>
<P>
Uruguay has the largest proportion of old people, with one in
every five aged 60 or over. Old people make up 18 per cent of the
population in Argentine, 16 percent in Barbados and 12 percent in
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The forecast follows a world-wide trend of an ageing
population. While the total world population is growing at only
1.7 percent a year, the number of old people is rising at an
annual rate of 2.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Weak Chinese Market Hurts Car Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- A slackening market has forced some
automakers and trading companies to slash prices below state-set
levels, challenging the government control of the auto market,
according to today's Business Weekly of China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the Dongfeng Citroen Automobile Co. and FAW
Volkswagen already acknowledge their prices do not cover
production costs and won't until they reach minimally profitable
annual production of 150,000 units several years from now.
</P>
<P>
Of the country's top-eight automakers, only Shanghai Volkswagen
Automobile Co. has reached economy-of-scale production, turning
out 160,000 Santana-model cars last year and aiming for production
of 220,000 this year, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Dongfeng Citroen Automobile Co. sells its 1.4-litre ZX Fukang,
or Citroen ZX, for 145,000 yuan, below the State-set minimum of
146,900 yuan. One year ago, it sold for 160,000 yuan and two years
ago, 184,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
FAW Volkswagen sells its 1.6-litre Jetta model for 144,000 yuan
(17,350 US dollars) -- below the state-set minimum of 147,200
yuan. One year ago, the Jetta sold for 170,000 yuan and two years
ago, 185,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Other auto producers have also sent their products on a
downward price spiral.
</P>
<P>
Government control of the auto market was implemented in 1994,
setting rigid ceilings and bottom lines for all sedan products in
the country within which automakers and trading companies could
adjust prices.
</P>
<P>
Experts warn that further decline in retail prices could push
some automakers to the fringe of bankruptcy and that a price
reduction would only reinforce potential buyers' wait-and-see
attitude.
</P>
<P>
Observers attribute the weak market to a reluctant buying from
institutional purchases, who are strangled under the nationwide
tight credit program and anti-corruption drive, and individuals
who shy away from the market under the weight of myriad taxes and
fees and traffic bans in some areas.
</P>
<P>
There are less than two million passenger cars at present in
China, or one for every 600 people.
</P>
<P>
Experts expressed a need for the government to take effective
measures to improve the market condition.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Muslims Threaten to Boycott Mostar Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian President Alija
Izetbegovic warned on Saturday that Muslims will boycott upcoming
elections in Mostar unless voting rules are changed.
</P>
<P>
Izetbegovic, who is himself a Muslim, told a press conference
here that he had sent a letter to Italian Foreign Minister Susanna
Agnelli to press for the change of the rules by the European Union
(EU) administrator in Mostar, Ricardo Perez Casado.
</P>
<P>
Italy currently holds the rotating presidency of the EU,
which has administered Mostar, a city divided into Muslim and
Croat sectors in 1993, since July 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim side has complained that current rules will result
in the exclusion of 23,000 Mostar refugees living abroad from
casting their ballots in the municipal elections at the end of
this month.
</P>
<P>
"We will not participate in elections in which all citizens
will not be able to vote in embassies and consulates or by post,"
said Izetbegovic.
</P>
<P>
None of the Muslim political parties had nominated candidates
for the Mostar elections by midnight on Friday, the deadline for
the ballot registration, while Croat parties have done so.
</P>
<P>
Hans Birchler, legal advisor to the EU administrator, said that
legally, elections can be held on May 31 since all parties have
been given a chance to register.
</P>
<P>
But politically, elections in Mostar wouldn't make any sense
with a half of the city's population not taking part, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Mostar elections will be discussed at Monday's meeting of
the EU council of ministers, Birchler added.

<HEADLINE> State Firms Laud Interest Rate Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- China's state-owned enterprises
warmly greeted the recent cut in interest rates, saying that the
move will increase their working capital and reduce their
production cost, according to the Business Weekly of China Daily
today.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed official of the Luoyang Petrochemical Corp in Henan
Province was quoted as saying that "the cut is tremendously
helpful to us."
</P>
<P>
The company has just applied for a 3.4 billion yuan (409
million US dollars) loan to launch a new project, the paper
reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials with China's biggest color TV maker,
Changhong Group Co. of Southwest China's Sichuan Province, said
the rate cut will reduce their repayment of loan interest by 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Anshan Iron and Steel Corp in Northeast
China's Liaoning Province said that the drop in the interest rate
has special significance to state-owned enterprises because they
often delay repayment of interest.
</P>
<P>
However, some enterprises said the cut is too small to be of
significant help, while enterprises with considerable bank
deposits showed indifference, because the rate on their deposits
was also cut 0.98 percentage point.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate cut seemed to have no obvious effect on
individuals, said the weekly.
</P>
<P>
A head of an outlet of the China Construction Bank said that
average daily deposits in her outlet during the first eight days
of this month were 500,000 yuan (60,200 US dollars), compared with
the average daily deposits of 466,000 yuan (56,000 US dollars) in
April.
</P>
<P>
A 66-year-old retired doctor said the cut reflected the
government's confidence in curbing inflation.
</P>
<P>
"If I had to choose between high interest rates with high
inflation and low interest rates with low inflation, I'd take the
latter," he said.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China has announced an average cut of 0.75
percentage points on loans from May 1. The interest rate on
one-year working capital loans, the most important loan category
for State-owned firms, fell from 12.06 percent to 10.98 percent.

industries and a population of 260-million, is a huge market, and
we don't want to give up investment opportunities there," a top
official of Siemens China, was quoted as saying at an
international seminar.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of 16 international conglomerates from the
United States, Britain, Japan, the Republic of Korea and Hong Kong

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing municipality will soon
issue a set of rules on Chinese people working in foreign firms or
representative offices in the city.
</P>
<P>
According to the "Beijing Youth Daily" , the regulations will
bar those without legal work permits from working for foreign
firms or offices.
</P>
<P>
All foreign firms and offices should apply to the local
authorities before they employ local staff. They are not permitted
to recruit through personal or illegal channels.
</P>
<P>
An official with the local labor service center said "there has
been a lot of problems arising from foreign firms and offices
employing local staff without going through the legal procedures."
</P>
<P>
The regulations are intended to protect the interests of both
local staff and their employers, the official said. "Illegally
employed staff are often not so well treated in salary and
welfare."
</P>
<P>
So far, there are four companies in the capital which are
authorized to handle the matter.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are over 5,000 foreign representative offices
in Beijing, employing thousands of Chinese. Only some 3,000 of
them are believed to employ staff through legal channels,

<HEADLINE> Jilin Strengthens Agricultural Input </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Jilin Province,
a major commodity grain production base, has pledged to broaden
financial channels for the development of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Local financial departments will put a record input of 260
million yuan (about 31 million US dollars) into agricultural
production this year.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, loans provided by provincial agricultural
credit departments will increase by 3.1 billion yuan, 10
percentage points higher than last year.
</P>
<P>
Located on the Songliao Plain, Jilin Province ranks first in
the country in terms of per capita grain output, exports and
commercial rate.
</P>
<P>
The province has set a target that by 2000 the province will
produce an additional five billion kg of grain, or one tenth of
the country's total increase in grain production in the Ninth
Five-Year Plan Period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
Towards that, the province must increase financial input in
agricultural production, local agricultural officials said.
</P>
<P>
This year, 130 million yuan will go to water conservancy
facilities, grain self-sufficiency project, construction of major
grain producing counties and introduction of improved varieties of
seeds.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 20 million yuan will be earmarked to popularize
farming techniques, 54 million yuan for animal husbandry,
development of 10 major towns and and 100 township enterprises,
and eight million yuan for aid-the-poor projects in 100 villages.
</P>
<P>
Financial channels will also be expanded by attracting foreign
investment. This year the province will utilize 300 million yuan
more of foreign investment than last year,
</P>
<P>
Also, the province has encouraged farmers to increase input in
agriculture. During the spring ploughing season money raised by
farmers themselves topped three billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Cantona Awards FA Cup for Manchester United </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United has created the
England soccer history of double twice in three years when the red
army beat its Liverpool arch-rivals 1-0 in the FA Cup final
Saturday afternoon at the well-known Wembley Stadium in London.
</P>
<P>
Eric Cantona, England's footballer of the year, struck a
classic volley in the 85 minute to give Manchester United another
major victory in just one week.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last week, the United crashed the Middlesbrough 3-0 to
win the English Premiership champion for the third time in four
years.
</P>
<P>
The FA Cup final, predicted to be a major clash between two
giants, became rather disappointing over most of the time until
Cantona's late stunning goal which seemed to make the 80,000 fans
from across the country feel somewhat satisfied.
</P>
<P>
The French international also made England soccer history
himself as the first overseas captain to lift the FA Cup.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the final, Mancheter United manager Alex
Ferguson said, "Eric makes the diffence and he always has
something left in the tank and I don't think how many players
could do that."
</P>
<P>
"I am so proud and it is really unbeliveable and the goal is
also magnificent," he added.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Government Wants to Talk with IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav government decided at
a session today that talks with the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), the World Bank (WB) and other foreign creditors should be
resumed immediately.
</P>
<P>
Jovan Zebic, Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister and coordinator of
all activities aimed at normalizing relations, was instructed to
invite the IMF and the WB to resume talks, prefarably in Belgrade,
the Yugoslav Information Secretariat said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The government session, chaired by Prime Minister Radoje
Kontic, focused on the normalization of relations with the IMF,
the WB and the World Trade Organization (WTO) and discussed a
report on Yugoslavia's relations with the European Union, it said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia failed to reach agreement with the IMF at talks held
in Paris in early April. But the Balkan country urgently needed to
join the financial organization to get loans for its economy
salvation.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav cabinet also decided to intensify activities aimed
at Yugoslavia's full integration into those international
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia was isolated from the international community in
1992 for its alleged involvement in the civil war in neighboring
Bosnia. Belgrade is still trying to be integrated into the
international forum and join the United Nations and other key
financial bodies.
</P>
<P>
The government said that the stands and commitments assumed so
far provided a good framework for a pragmatic approach to the
normalization of relations with international financial
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav Foreign Ministry was instructed to prepare a
platform for initiating talks on institutionalizing relations with
the European Union, with a recommendation that Yugoslavia join the
financial assistance program and programs for scientific and
other cooperation, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
This would help create preconditions for starting a process of
Yugoslavia's broad integration into the European Union, it added.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet also adopted a project for adjusting the Yugoslav
legal system to the EU legislation so as to be more easily
readmitted into the union, it said.

<HEADLINE> Bosnia, Croatia Sign Accords for Closer Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Bosnia and Croatia on Saturday
signed two temporary agreements on providing each other with sea
outlet and land transit, according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
The agreements were signed after the second session of the
Council for Cooperation between Bosnia's Muslim-Croat federation
and Croatia, which was held in Zagreb and attended by government
delegations led by Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovic and
Croatian president Franjo Tudjman.
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the accords, Croatia will allow the Bosnian
federation to use its Adriatic port of Ploce, while Bosnia will
permit free transit for Croatian vehicles and merchandise through
Neum, a Bosnian city which divides the Croatian coastal line.
</P>
<P>
The participants also called for speeding up of the work on a
joint federal defense law, which will lead to an integrated
Muslim-Croat army, and creation of cantons in the federation.
</P>
<P>
"We have managed to establish a pilot project for the return
of refugees", said Izetbegovic, upon his return from Zagreb. Under
the project, a still unspecified number of refugees will return to
Bugojno and Travnik, under the Muslim control, and to Jajce and
Stolac, under the Croat control.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Bosnian and Croatian leaders came on the
eve of a conference in Washington at which the United States is
expected to press for cooperation between Muslims and Croats,
especially on the issue of joint army.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Demands Assurances from Britain on Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams
demanded today that British Prime Minister John Major give
specific assurances that the planned all-party talks process on
the future of Northern Ireland will be real and meaningful,
according to reports from Belfast.
</P>
<P>
At a party meeting in the capital of the crisis-laden Northern
Ireland, Adams said such assurances had been offered by Irish
Prime Minister John Bruton in a speech last month and Major should
follow the suit.
</P>
<P>
And such assurances would be helpful in restoring the damaged
peace process, he argued.
</P>
<P>
Adams called for actual details and points of agenda for the
all-party talks instead of bland statements from the British
government.
</P>
<P>
He also again urged the British government to carry out
militarisation in Northern Ireland as a response to Britain's call
for arms decommissioning by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) before
the all-party talks started.
</P>
<P>
One of Sinn Fein's key demands has been met as the British
government has approved the transfer of an IRA sick prisoner
Patrick Kelly from Britain to a jail in the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
However, Adams argued that that was immaterial to the wider
question of a new IRA cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
It was reported earlier today that Sinn Fein and the IRA were
under pressure to restore cease-fire not just from their political
opponents, but also from their supporters.
</P>
<P>
Congressman Peter King, one of their strongest supporters in
the US, described today the IRA's decision to resume violence as a
tragic mistake.
</P>
<P>
King warned Sinn Fein that they would not get much, if any,
support in the US unless the IRA restored its cease-fire.

BELGRADE, May 11 (Xinhua) -- French IFOR troops today
surrounded with tanks and armored vehicles Dobrinja District, the
Muslim part of Sarajevo, where Serb-Muslim clashes broke out last
night.
</P>
<P>
U.N. and NATO sources said that a Muslim was shot in the chest
with serious wound and a Serb received slight injuries when three
grenades were hurled at his vehicle in these clashes on Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
The line of separation between the two entities in Dobrinja
literally runs through buildings and even apartments, thus making
the Serbs and Muslims in the same place quarrel and clash easily.
</P>
<P>
One building in the Muslim part is surrounded by at least two
tanks, eight armored transporters and about 50 French troops,
Tanjug news agency said.
</P>
<P>
French Col. Bertrand Madoux said their task was only to see
that no one escaped, and that they would pass the case on to the
Bosnian and international police as soon as they went into the
building.
</P>
<P>
The two police forces would then go into the building to search
for hidden weaponry, Tanjug added.

<HEADLINE> Two Million Malawians To Be Infected With HIV By </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- It is estimated that two million
people in Malawi will be infected with the virus that causes AIDS
by the year 2,000, up from the current 1.1 million, said a World
Bank report.
</P>
<P>
Malawi's population, currently around 11 million, is growing
at a rate of 3.3 percent but average life expectancy will drop
from 57 years to 33 years as the killer disease takes its toll,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 people will suffer from full-blown AIDS and
350,000 children will be orphaned by then in the southern African
country, the ninth poorest nation in the world, the report said.
</P>
<P>
This will cause a sharp fall in gross domestic product (GDP)
over the decade that follows, the report said, adding that by the
year 2010, the country's real GDP will be 10 percent less than it
would have been without the effects of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Per capita income will be three percent lower than if there is
no AIDS. Productivity and the growth of the labour force will
fall, while increased health expenditure will deplete national
savings, the reported added.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's minister of agriculture
today called for investors to take advantage of the country's
conducive investment climate and put more in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
At a specialized international agricultural trade fair here
today, Minister Aalhaji Muhammadu Gambo said that investment in
Nigeria's agricultural sector was very promising as the country
was well endowed with a variety of vegetational and climatic
zones as well as land, water resources and high-calibre manpower.
</P>
<P>
Presented on his behalf by the director of planing, statistics
and research in the ministry, D. E. Oyakhilome, the minister said
that investment opportunities abounded in areas such as crops
cultivation, livestock production, fishery, forestry resources
and fabrication of local tools.
</P>
<P>
At the opening of the trade fair, the minister said that
agriculture was essentially private-sector affair, with the
government playing supportive, regulatory and stimulatory roles.
</P>
<P>
The government has provided attractive incentives to the
private sector for investment in agriculture, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister also emphasized that to provide adequate food and
nutrition for Nigerians and plan for agriculture demands the
collective responsibility of the organized private sector,
government, individuals, industrialists and philanthropists.
