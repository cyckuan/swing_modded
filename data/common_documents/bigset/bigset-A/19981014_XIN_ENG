<HEADLINE> Bosnian President Postpones Visit to Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 13 (Xinhua) -- It seems not appropriate for
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic to visit Egypt at present, the
charge d'affaires of Bosnian embassy was quoted by Egypt's Middle
East News Agency (MENA) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The invitation was made by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
and contacts are underway between Cairo and Sarajevo to set the
date for the visit, which is to take place most likely by the end
of this month, said the Bosnian diplomat.
</P>
<P>
"It seems that the present time is not appropriate for this
visit, taking into consideration the conditions in Kosovo
(Yugoslavia)," he told MENA.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between the Yugoslav forces and ethnic Albanian armed
groups escalated over the past weeks in Kosovo. Hundreds have died
and thousands others been displaced since Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown on February 28 against the
ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting to wrest
Kosovo province from Serbia.
</P>
<P>
In a developing confrontation between Milosevic and the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, the 16-nation alliance has
threatened air strikes against Yugoslavia if Milosevic fails to
end military action against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of
Yugoslavia. Ninety percent of its 2 million people are ethnic
Albanians and 10 percent, Serbs.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council on September 23 demanded withdrawal
of more Serb troops from Kosovo, allowing humanitarian aid to
refugees and opening up serious talks with the secessionists on
the restoration of self-rule for the ethnic Albanians-dominated
province.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice Minister on China's Fiscal Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 13 (Xinhua ) -- Chinese Vice Minister of
Finance Lou Jiwei said Tuesday that the Chinese government has
adopted a positive fiscal policy in the face of the Asian
financial crisis and has achieved good results.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at the Seventh East Asian Economic Summit,
Lou said from the beginning of the Asian financial crisis the
Chinese government has pursued a policy to stabilize the exchange
rate of its currency and expand domestic demand for the benefit of
its own economy and the economy of the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Three months ago, it decided to add specific positive policies
to expand fiscal expenditure in a bid to ensure economic growth,
he said.
</P>
<P>
On the much-talked issue of the devaluation of the RMB, he said
despite mounting pressures, China has committed itself not to
devaluate its currency amid the regional turmoil.
</P>
<P>
China holds that devaluation could not increase its export, but
rather could start a new round of competitive devaluation in the
Asian region, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Devaluation of the RMB would harm Asian countries and the
people in the region who have already been hit by the Asian
financial crisis, he said. So China avoided to do so, he added.
</P>
<P>
Lou noted that some countries that had devaluated their
currencies competitively at the start of the crisis have taken
measures to expand their internal demands and as a result their
currencies appeared to start moving toward stability.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that countries badly hit by the Asian
crisis could get out of the mire through restructuring and reform
and that developed countries and international institutions
shoulder more responsibilities to bring the region out of the
crisis by taking emergency and effective measures.

<HEADLINE> Lukashenko Denounces Air Passage Permission for NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Belarussian President Alexander
Lukashenko Tuesday expressed "shock" over the readiness expressed
by several countries including Bulgaria and Romania to allow
passage for NATO aircraft to bomb Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Such permission signifies "conspiracy to the crimes being
prepared at the Balkans," the Interfax news agency quoted
Lukashenko as saying in Minsk.
</P>
<P>
"The leaders of the former socialist countries put up their
people for a strike. Do the leaders have to humiliate themselves
and their people to such a degree to get into NATO, being
apprehensive that the European Union would reject them? Our Slav
unity is sacred! Suddenly it is all betrayed, stomped out," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said Minsk's attitude toward these states that allowed NATO
air passage "has morally changed."
</P>
<P>
"Not only Belarus but Russia and Ukraine in future will make
pertinent conclusions with regard to their relations with these
countries," Lukashenko said.
</P>
<P>
However, Lukashenko said he was firmly against the dispatch of
Belarussian volunteer units to Yugoslavia and the country's
constitution banned Belarussians from taking part in military
actions abroad.
</P>
<P>
"As a statesman and a president, I will fight for Yugoslavia
using my own methods," he said.
</P>
<P>
Also Tuesday, the Belarussian Foreign Ministry urged NATO to
discontinue preparations for air strikes in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"The crisis can be resolved only through full compliance with
U.N. Security Council resolutions on Kosovo by all parties. The
resolutions do not give NATO a mandate to use force," the ministry
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Use of force against a sovereign country without U.N. Security
Council authorization is flagrant violation of the U.N. Charter,
contravenes the basic legal principles of international relations
and undermines the security and confidence system on the European
continent," Interfax quoted the statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
"NATO's military intervention in an internal conflict will
aggravate the confrontation in Kosovo rather than remove its
causes. NATO's strikes against targets in Yugoslavia will amount
to new hostilities in the Balkans resulting inevitably in chaos
and loss of civilian life, long-term destabilization of Europe,
new flows of refugees and other unpredictable consequences," the
statement said.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Assured of Fastness of Aswan High Dam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
has been assured of the fastness of Aswan High Dam on the Nile
river despite of the unprecedented high water in the past weeks.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak was told by Minister of Public Works and Water
Resources Mahmoud Abu Zeid Tuesday that the dam's structure was
not affected by the rising water. He was inspecting the dam and
inaugurating new power stations at the reservoir behind the dam,
the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri and some other
cabinet members, Mubarak reviewed the Toshka emergency spillway,
used to discharge excessive water in the Lake Nasser behind the
dam when needed.
</P>
<P>
Abu Zeid said since its erection in 1971, the dam has protected
Egypt, which used to suffer periodic floodings and droughts from
the Nile, from six devastating floods and 10 very low flows. It
was the dam that prepared the grounds for a stable agriculture in
Egypt, for the first time in history.
</P>
<P>
The water in the man-made Lake Nasser, which stretches 500
kilometers up the Nile, rose to a record level of 181.15 meters on
Monday. Excess water was being channel to the Toshka canal to
irrigate a swath of the desert to the northwest of the dam.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time since the dam was completed that the
Nile water was diverted. The first was in 1996 when the water
behind the dam reached 178 meters, a record high.
</P>
<P>
The current diversion period began early September when the
water rose upon the dam's safety level of 175 meters.
</P>
<P>
Africa's longest river of 1,670 kilometers, the Nile runs
south-north through several countries before pouring into the
Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
It has an average annual flow of 84 billion cubic meters, with
80 percent of the volume concentrated in the flood season from
August through October.

HELSINKI, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The Finnish government issued
a statement Tuesday welcoming the new agreement over Kosovo crisis
struck between U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke and Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
"We are satisfied that a political solution has been reached
over the Kosovo crisis. It is the determination of the
international community that has prompted such a solution,"
Finnish Foreign Minister Tarja Halonen said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
She said that the door is already open for the implementation
of the U.N. Security Council Resolution 1199 as well as for Kosovo
refugees' return to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
She also added that the Finnish government would discuss how to
participate and contribute its efforts in helping carry out the
agreement and ease situation in the troubled Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
NATO on Tuesday night authorized air strikes on Yugoslavia at
any time but gave Yugoslav government four days' grace to comply
with all U.N. demands which also include the free access of
international aid agencies in Kosovo and allow thousands of
refugees to go back home.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: One Israeli Killed in Shooting Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 13 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli man was killed and
another one critically injured in a shooting incident Tuesday,
Israeli police said.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred near Ora, a communal farm about five
kilometers west of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby said the victims
were bathing in a spring near Ora when shots were fired at
them. The assailants fled from the scene after the shooting and
their car was later found abandoned in the southern Jerusalem,
near the border with the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The assailants were Palestinian militants and Israeli police
and soldiers of the defense forces are conducting a manhunt for
the assailants.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Palestinan militant groups have carried out a
number of drive-by shootings in hoping of wrecking
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
In August, two Jewish seminary students were shot and killed
outside the West Bank settlement of Yitzhar.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's shooting came two days before the Israeli and
Palestinian leaders were to meet in Washington to strike an
agreement on Israel's further troop redeployment in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Uzi Landau, Chairman of the Knesset (parliament) Foreign
Affairs and Defense Committee, sharply criticized the shooting
incident, calling on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu no to go
to Washington summit starting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But Meir Sheetrit, Knesset Coalition Chairman, said the the
incident should not be used to veto the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The peace process must move forward without any conditions
and we must understand that some people want to destroy the
process," Sheetrit told the Israel Radio.

<HEADLINE> UK Inflation on Target for Second Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Inflation has remained at the
British government's target level of 2.5 percent for the second
month running, increasing calls for the Bank of England to cut
interest rates further.
</P>
<P>
The underlying rate of inflation in September was unchanged
from August, according to the Office for National Statistics. The
headline rate of inflation which includes the cost of mortgages
dropped slightly by 0.1 percent to 3.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The retail inflation figures follow data released Monday
showing that the rise in prices of goods leaving factory gates is
at its lowest point for almost 40 years.
</P>
<P>
Factory gate prices are regarded as a valuable guide to the
long-term outlook for retail inflation and some commentators now
believe the figure may even fall below the government's target.
</P>
<P>
Barry Naisbitt, Abbey National spokesman, was quoted by a BBC
report as saying, "It's really very good news that inflation is
still right on target and suggesting that there isn't a great deal
of inflationary pressure in the U.K. economy at the moment."
</P>
<P>
Sheetal Radia of Standard and Poor's said, "I think the fact
that the headline inflation rate, which is the key for pay
settlements, has softened, is basically boding well for lower pay
rises in future. I think that's going to be supportive of the Bank
of England or the MPC cutting rates later this year."
</P>
<P>
World stock markets soared Monday partly in the hope of
interest rate cuts in leading economies, with the FTSE 100 Index
of leading shares posting its biggest ever daily points gain.
</P>
<P>
Last week the Bank of England cut interest rates by 0.25
percent to 7.25 percent, saying the international economic crisis
had become more of a risk to Britain's economy than domestic
inflation.
</P>
<P>
Some commentators claim the risk to the economy is now of
deflation, rather than inflation.
</P>
<P>
But while the inflation figures have given ammunition to the
so-called `doves' who favor rate cuts on the bank's Monetary
Policy Committee, analysts said that wages were still rising at
worrying levels.
</P>
<P>
Official wages figures had to be revised upwards recently as
pay settlements increased beyond expectations.
</P>
<P>
Julian Jessop, analyst at Nikko Europe, said, "There is clearly
deflation in some sectors of the economy, but the bank is
concentrating on wage rises."
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately the MPC wants to see more unemployment before it
is happy that inflation is under control," he said.
</P>
<P>
Several members of the MPC follow the view that a rise in
jobless figures would create a downwards pressure on wages,
keeping a tight lid on inflation.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Gets Conditional Support from Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli cabinet Tuesday gave
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the mandate to negotiate a deal
with the Palestinians in the coming U.S. summit, but linking it to
Palestinian security guarantees, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet secretary Danny Naveh said the ministers put support
behind Netanyahu as he is due to begin talks with Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat at Wye Plantation
in Maryland Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But the cabinet's support was on conditions that the
Palestinians live up to their commitment and Israel's security
needs be met, Naveh said.
</P>
<P>
Gaps have been narrowed between Israel and the Palestinians on
the negotiations over the second Israeli withdrawal from the West
Bank, but differences still remain, especially on the security
fields.
</P>
<P>
Even if the conditions are met during the U.S. summit and an
agreement on a 13 percent Israeli withdrawal is signed, the
National Religious Party (NRP) - the extreme rightist party in
Netanyahu's coalition - still needs to debate on its next move,
party officials said.
</P>
<P>
NRP has threatened to topple the government if it gives up 13
percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians. But after Netanyahu
seemed to have decided to go his own way, the NRP said that it

</P>
<P>
NRP Minister Shaul Yhalom said after the cabinet meeting that
if an agreement is signed in the coming talks his party will have
a debate and then decide if it will move forward to topple the
government. The party will see whether all the Jewish settlements
in the West Bank are unaffected by the agreement, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the cabinet meeting, the hardline Infrastructure Minister
Ariel Sharon was unanimously approved foreign minister as
expected. He was appointed to the new post by Netanyahu last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sharon will, together with Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
and Industry and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky, join Netanyahu
in the U.S. talks.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has reacted cautiously to the appointment of Sharon,
saying that it will deal with him as other Israeli foreign
ministers.

<HEADLINE> India, Mauritius Agree to Boost Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 13 ( Xinhua) -- India and Mauritius agreed
Tuesday to explore ways to upgrade political relations and give a
new dimension to bilateral economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached during wide-ranging discussions
between visiting Mauritian Prime Minister Navinchandra Ramgoolam
and Indian leaders.
</P>
<P>
Ramgoolam arrived here earlier today for a two-day official
visit to the south Asian country, during which an agreement on
civil aviation would be signed between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Mauritian leader called on Indian President Kocheril Raman
Narayanan and later held separate meetings with Home Minister L.
K. Advani, Defense Minister George Fernandes and Finance Minister
Yashwant Sinha.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to hold talks later with Indian Prime Minister
Atal Behari Vajpayee on regional, international and mutual
concerns, which would be a follow-up of talks the two leaders had
when Vajpayee visited Mauritius last month.
</P>
<P>
Ramgoolam also met the opposition Congress President Sonia
Gandhi and will meet other Indian government leaders Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Following a ceremonial reception by Indian Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee Tuesday, Ramgoolam told reporters that his visit
would further strengthen bilateral relations between the two
countries in political and economic spheres.
</P>
<P>
The visiting prime minister said that apart from receiving
technical assistance from India, his country would also explore
the possibilities of increasing trade and investment with India.
</P>
<P>
Mauritius, a member of the Indian Ocean Rim for Regional
Cooperation, is one of the leading investors in India and its
exports to India last year amounted to some 12.5 million U.S.
dollars while India's exports to the country was about 100 million
U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Contact Group to Ponder Further Steps on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The international Contact Group
will meet within the next one or two days to consider further
steps over the latest agreements on Kosovo reached in Belgrade, a
Russian Foreign Ministry official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Russia wants the meeting to be held at the level of the
foreign ministries," said Vladimir Chizhov, director of the
Russian Foreign Ministry's Europe III Department.
</P>
<P>
The agreements, reached in Belgrade between Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke, was
"a very important step towards changing the situation for the
better," the Interfax news agency quoted Chizhov as saying.
</P>
<P>
"A turning point has been reached. It makes no sense to discuss
the use of force now," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged NATO to cancel its decision on political consent to
the use of force against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The international community succeeded through "coordinated
actions and with Russia's active role," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that at a meeting with the Russian foreign and defense
ministers on October 4 in Belgrade, the Yugoslav leadership agreed
in principle to accept a civilian mission of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke enhanced these agreements, Chizhov said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir
Rakhmanin, welcoming the Milosevic-Holbrooke agreements, said he
was confident that Russia would take part in what he described as
the OSCE Observer Mission in Kosovo, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Chizhov said a resolution of the U.N. Security Council and a
decision of the OSCE Permanent Council are needed to send an
observer mission. It will take a few days, he said.
</P>
<P>
"A physical deployment of the mission is a matter of weeks," he
said.

ATHENS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Greek equities Tuesday rebounded
strongly on the Athens Stock Exchange with the general index
ending 2.46 percent higher to 1,782.49 points.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE/ASE 20 index also ended 2.46 percent higher to
1,055.49 points.
</P>
<P>
Trading remained thin with turnover at 29.3 billion drachmas
(about 103 million U.S. dollars).

Advancers led decliners by 174 to 49 with another 19 issues
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Banks and industrials rose 2.60 percent and 2.53 percent
respectively, with construction increasing 1.45 percent.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Greek equities came under pressure on the Athens
Stock Exchange with the general index falling below the 1,800
level for the first time in seven months this year.
</P>
<P>
Financial analysts attributed the decline to continued
uncertainty of international financial markets and the sudden
increase in Greece's inflation, which currently stands at 5.2
percent.

<HEADLINE> Annan Welcomes Breakthrough Over Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan "warmly welcomes" the news of a breakthrough in efforts
to end the Kosovo crisis and he will send a mission to the region
in the coming days, a U.N. spokesman said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Fred Eckhard, U.N. spokesman, told a press conference, "It is
of paramount importance that both sides in Kosovo honor their
commitments and fully comply with the provisions of (U.N.)
Security Council resolutions."
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general intends to send a mission to the region
in the coming days in response to the Security Council's statement
last week," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Jeremy Greenstock, preident of the 15-member Security Council,
issued an oral statement last week, asking the U.N. chief to
consider ways to get the first-hand information on what is going
on in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
On September 23, the Security Council adopted a resolution,
demanding an immediate cease-fire and the beginning of a
political dialogue on the Kosovo crisis, which broke out in
February this year.
</P>
<P>
At the end of his marathon talks with U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to
international ground and air verification of its compliance with
U.N. resolutions on Kosovo, Serbia's province of mainly ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
In his televised address to the nation, Milosevic said Tuesday
that his talks with Holbrooke had averted the threat of NATO air
strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"The agreements we have reached remove the danger of military
intervention against our country," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a statement by Milosevid's office said his talks
with Holbrooke yielded a "constructive approach" for a political
solution that would give Kosovo autonomy within Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanians, who make up some 90 percent of Kosovo's
province of 2 million, have been battling with Serbs for
independence.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Many mountainous and coastal
areas through Lebanon were hit by raging natural fires on Tuesday,
the official National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It said that Lebanon's northern, central and southern
mountainous and southern coastal areas were affected by the fires
and more than 1 million square meters of forests have been
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The worst thing is that the fires have threatened the
country's symbolic cedar trees of the national reserve in the
central Chouf Mountain.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters, civil defense units and government army have
been sent to the affected areas to join efforts with local
residents to fight the fires, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's Environment Ministry officials attributed the quickly
spreading fires to the sustained heat wave and severe shortage of
adequate fire fighting equipment.

<HEADLINE> Russia Denounces NATO Decision Over Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Russia described as a "mistake"
NATO's Monday decision on political consent to the use of force
against Yugoslavia with a 96-hour delay.
</P>
<P>
"Such steps are only complicating the political process of
settling the situation" in Kosovo, Foreign Ministry spokesman
Vladimir Rakhmanin told a briefing Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the spokesman said Moscow welcomes "the progress
achieved at the latest talks in Belgrade on a political resolution
of the Kosovo problem, including the agreement between U.S.
special envoy Richard Holbrooke and Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic."
</P>
<P>
Tuesday morning, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov held
telephone conversations with his French, Italian and German
counterparts to consider "possible additional diplomatic efforts
to find solutions," Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Itar-Tass, quoting sources with
the Russian Foreign Ministry, reported that the Contact Group,
which includes Russia, Britain, the United States, France and
Italy, will meet in Paris Thursday at the foreign ministers'
level.
</P>
<P>
Rakhmanin declined to comment on statements by some Russian
politicians that Russian arms may be supplied to Yugoslavia in the
event of NATO's military strikes.
</P>
<P>
"We do not intend to say which specific measures Russia may
take if NATO uses force against Yugoslavia, Rakhmanin said. "This
is a purposeful line of conduct."
</P>
<P>
Moscow "is not after a deterioration of its relations with
NATO," but if NATO implements any military operation against
Yugoslavia, its relations with Russia "will naturally require a
certain correction," Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Russian State Duma, or lower house of
parliament, is sending a delegation to Belgrade shortly, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Duma Deputy Chairman Sergei Baburin, head of the anti-NATO
informal group in the Duma, said the delegation will leave for
Yugoslavia Thursday morning to help stave off the Kosovo crisis.

BAGHDAD, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Former Bulgarian Prime
Minister Reneta Indzhova said here Tuesday that her party would
continue coordinating with the organizations and unions in
Bulgaria with an aim to lift the trade embargo on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Indzhova, leader of the Real Reforms Movement party, made the
remark during her meeting with Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin
Ramadan, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Ramadan praised the good relations
between Iraq and Bulgaria and stressed that Iraq had the
intention of enhancing cooperation with Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
For her part, Indzhova expressed sympathy with the people of
Iraq, who are suffering from the eight-year U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed economic sanctions -- including a
ban on air flights and limits on sales of oil -- on Iraq
following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh met
Indzhova and her delegation that arrived in Baghdad on Monday,

CAIRO, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said Tuesday that Cairo will continue to mediate the
Turkish-Syrian dispute and hoped that the crisis will be resolved
through political means.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said he has talked on telephone with his Turkish
counterpart Ismail Cem and that he will call up Syrian Foreign
Minister Farouq al-Sharaa later in the day to go on with efforts
to defuse tension between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"I hope there is real progress towards defusing the
Turkish-Syrian row, and that we have succeeded in surmounting the
crisis," he told reporters, commenting on his talks with Turkish
and Syrian officials Monday.
</P>
<P>
Moussa paid a one-day visit to Ankara and Damascus Monday to
try to contain the crisis between the two neighbors. At the end of
the visit to Turkey, Moussa described his talks with Turkish
officials as "constructive and useful."
</P>
<P>
Relations between Turkey and Syria have always been
troublesome. Turkey has long accused Syria of harboring Turkish
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), which has been fighting
since 1984 for autonomy of the Kurdish minority in southeastern
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Syria, denying the charges, repeatedly voiced its concern and
fear over Turkey's close military alliance with Israel that
threatens Arab security.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has stepped up a war of words against Syria recently and
it war-like rhetoric has aroused fears of a regional conflict.
</P>

Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Iranian Foreign Minister
Kamal Kharrazi have shuttled between Turkey and Syria to try to

MOSCOW, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Azeri President Geidar Aliyev
said Tuesday that the Sunday presidential elections were
democratic despite minor offenses, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Aliyev, who was reelected president, refuted the view of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the
Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly observers that the
elections had not met international standards.
</P>
<P>
The observers could have been more impartial, Aliyev told a
press conference in Baku, the Azeri capital.
</P>
<P>
Aliyev said he was sure that his country would be admitted to
the Council of Europe, and that Azerbaijan was the only Muslim
country calling for abolition of the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
Three quarters of the voters supported him, Aliyev said. He
called on opposition leaders to work for national unity but said
that none of his rivals in the presidential elections would become
a government minister.
</P>
<P>
Aliyev, 75, pocketed 77 percent of the ballots cast at the
presidential elections, well over the two-thirds needed for a win.
</P>
<P>
Aliyev was elected president of this Caspian oil-rich country
for the first time in 1993.

WASHINGTON, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) will station a stand-by military force near
Kosovo to protect unarmed observers of an agreement to end
violence in the Serbian province, the Pentagon said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that what you will see is some kind of rapid
reaction capability which would be over the horizon, but not
located there in Kosovo," said Mike Doubleday, a Defense
Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He told a Pentagon briefing that it was unlikely to include
American troops, but that final plans were not complete.
</P>
<P>
Doubleday also confirmed that U.S. and other NATO warplanes
would be available near Kosovo to protect unarmed NATO military
surveillance planes which will fly over the province to monitor
compliance with the agreement.
</P>
<P>
He said the surveillance planes could include high-flying
American U-2 spy planes, four-engine P-3 "Orion" and other
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed Monday to fully
comply with U.N. Security Council resolutions by withdrawing
forces from Kosovo and accepted an international inspection team
to monitor the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. President Bill Clinton warned that Milosevic must
keep its promises, otherwise NATO was ready to act.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of
the United Nations Monday once again called on Iraq to reverse its
decision and resume full cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the Security Council was briefed by Dr.
El-Baradei, the director-general of the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA), and by Richard Butler, the executive
chairman of the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM), on
their six-monthly reports on their activities in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
On the IAEA report, the members of the council noted that the
report stated that should Iraq recommence full cooperation with
the IAEA, there would be no impediment to the full implementation
of the IAEA's plan for ongoing monitoring and verification, which
must be comprehensive and intrusive.
</P>
<P>
On the UNSCOM report, members of the council focused on the
need for Iraq to return to full cooperation if forward progress
was to be made.
</P>
<P>
On the chemical weapons and missiles files, members of the
council felt that there were not many items still to be resolved
if that cooperation was forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
The council noted that on the biological weapons file, rather
more work was needed, which depended crucially on full disclosure
by Iraq, including information on biological weapons which they
already say they have.
</P>
<P>
In the light of the reports, the council once again called on
Iraq to take the decision to resume full cooperation with the IAEA
and the UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced suspension of cooperation with the IAEA and the
UNSCOM in early August after the talks between Iraq and the UNSCOM
collapsed. The Security Council decided to suspend its regular
review of U.N. sanctions against Iraq until it resumes full
cooperation with the U.N.

<HEADLINE> Polio No Longer Threat to Mozambican Kids: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Polio has no longer posed a big
threat to the health of Mozambican children, a senior Mozambican
health official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Mozambican National Health Bureau Alexandre
Manguele said at a televised meeting that no polio cases have
been found in the last three to four years.
</P>
<P>
Manguele disclosed that during the second national polio
immunization campaign from September 28 to October 2, three
million children under the age of five years had been immunized
across the country.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican government aimed at a 90-percent vaccination
rate among children under five during the first and second phases
of the anti-polio drive, said the health official.
</P>
<P>
He noted that epidemics monitoring networks have been set up
throughout the southern African country and every province has
its own well-trained medical personnels so that they can report
the diagnosed cases to higher institutions.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican First Lady Marcelina Chissano said at the meeting
that media have played an important role in the anti-polio
campaign because they can sensitize people on the harm of the
epidemic through illustrative images.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Currency Edges Up on Export Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan Shilling edged up
against the U.S. Dollar in thin trade Tuesday as Dollar inflows
dealers.
</P>
<P>
The Shilling was quoted between 59.85 and 59.95 at 0930 GMT
Tuesday, from around 59.90/60.00 at the open.
</P>
<P>
"Even a small amount (of Dollar inflow) is enough to move the
Shilling," said one dealer.
</P>
<P>
The traders said that the low trading volume could be partly
explained by this week's planned motion of no confidence in the
government.
</P>
<P>
The bill, proposed by opposition member of parliament James
Orengo, is expected to be mentioned Wednesday and debated
Thursday, according to local media.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here say that it has little or no chance of success.
</P>
<P>
"Activity is subdued," said one trader. "People are watching
to see what happens tomorrow (Wednesday)."
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Kenya posted the Shilling at an opening
indicative mean of 59.9483 against the U.S. Dollar Tuesday from
59.9222 at Monday's open.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Upbeat About Lesotho Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 13 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela Tuesday reiterated his optimism that a solution
would be reached in Lesotho to end the political crisis in the
tiny mountain kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said this after meeting with Lesotho Queen's mother
Mamqhato Seeiso and Prince Seeiso in South Africa's eastern port
city of Durban.
</P>
<P>
The South African president discussed with the Lesotho royal
members about the situation in the kingdom, which has been
unrestful since August following allegations by opposition
parties of May 23 election fraud.
</P>
<P>
Mandela told reporters that he had invited the queen to brief
him on the Lesotho situation and to get her views in order to
find a solution to the country's crisis.
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that we are on the right track to settle
Lesotho's problems, and I believe the political leaders and all
other people involved will come to an understanding to resolve
the problem," South African Press Association quoted Mandela as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he did not want the media to pose any questions
to the queen and the prince as the Lesotho matter was sensitive
and question could endanger the progress that had been made.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the president said that he believed a breakthrough
in Lesotho's political problem was imminent and that a Southern
African Development Community (SADC) proposal for a political
solution to the kingdom's problem would win in the end.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho, a land-locked country surrounded by South Africa, has
been in turmoil since its May election, which opposition parties
claim were rigged in favor of the ruling Lesotho Congress for
Democracy (LCD).
</P>
<P>
South Africa and Botswana sent their troops to Lesotho in the
name of the SADC to help the Lesotho government to restore law
and security in late September.
</P>
<P>
The LCD and opposition party alliance are due to hold their
third round of peace talks over political disputes. South
African Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi, head of the
SADC delegation, will chair the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Peace Talks Start in Arusha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The third round of
Burundi peace talks opened Tuesday in north Tanzania's Arusha
town with conflicting parties having a general debate of
democracy in the central Africa country.
</P>
<P>
Mark Bomani, a senior aide to the talks mediator Julius
Nyerere, former president of Tanzania, told Xinhua over telephone
that the debate will continue Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks, aimed at ending the five-year civil war in
Burundi, have brought together the Burundian government
delegation, the National Assembly, and various warring factions
like FRODEBU, a pro-Hutu party, pro-Tutsi UPRONA, and the largest
rebel group CNDD.
</P>
<P>
The Burundian government delegation is led by Minister of
Peace Process Ambroise Niyonsaba.
</P>
<P>
According to other sources at the meeting, the items on the
talks agenda include debate of good governance and democracy,
choosing chairmen of five committees to discuss aspects of the
Burundi conflict, start of work of the committees, discussions on
peace and security in Burundi, among others.
</P>
<P>
"The chairmen of the five commissions will be appointed
tomorrow," Bomani said, adding that consultations were conducted
Tuesday on the candidates for the chairmen. However, he declined
to name them.
</P>
<P>
The third round of talks had been planned to open Monday but
was postponed to Tuesday to wait for the arrival of more
delegates.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which may last more than 10 days, are attended by
observers from the United Nations, the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
East and central African nations, backed by the OAU, have
imposed economic sanctions on Burundi since August 1996 shortly
after Major Pierre Buyoya toppled a civilian government led by
President Ntibantunganya.
</P>
<P>
More than 150,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed
in Burundi since October 1993, in a series of massacres and in
armed conflict between Burundi's Tutsi-dominated army and Hutu
rebels.
</P>
<P>
Warring parties signed a cease-fire agreement in the first
round of talks in June and dwelt mainly on the genesis of the
Burundi conflict at the second round of talks in July.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Leaders Discuss Issues Surrounding UNSCOM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi leaders made no decision
on whether to resume cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors at
their meeting Tuesday, the official Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
President Saddam Hussein chaired the joint meeting of the
Revolutionary Command Council and the regional command of the
Baath party.
</P>
<P>
INA said the meeting discussed the results of Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz's recent New York talks with the U.N. chief
and member states of the Security Council, but reached no decision.
</P>
<P>
It said the Iraqi leadership would continue with the discussion
of this issue in the following days.
</P>
<P>
Iraq decided on August 5 to suspend cooperation with the United
Nations Special Committee (UNSCOM) and the International Atomic
Energy Agency, complaining that UNSCOM is dominated by the
U.S. and bent on prolonging sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council responded on September 9 by canceling its
regular reviews of crippling sanctions. But in the meantime, the
council promised it would conduct a comprehensive review of the
sanctions regime once Iraq resumes cooperation with its weapons
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Iraq criticized the council's response and said it would not
rescind its ban on U.N. weapons inspections until UNSCOM was
restructured to curb U.S. influence and that the sanctions are
lifted or eased.
</P>
<P>
To break the deadlock between Iraq and the Security Council,
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan invited Aziz to New York at the
end of September to discuss Iraq's relations with the U.N..
</P>
<P>
Aziz spent most of his time in New York evaluating the offered
review by the council and holding three meetings with Annan, but
he said he needed to report to the leadership, which can decide if
the cooperation can be resumed.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq following its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait cannot be lifted unless UNSCOM verifies that it is free
of chemical, biological weapons and long-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
INA said Tuesday's meeting also discussed U.S. interferences in
Iraq's internal affairs. U.S. Congress invited Iraq's Kurdish
leaders to Washington for a conciliatory meeting and provided them
with money and weapons.
</P>
<P>
The meeting said U.S. "wanton interferences in Iraq's internal
affairs" contradict the principles of international laws and the
spirit and text of the Security Council resolutions which call for
respect of Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
It also accused UNSCOM of spying on Iraq in coordination with
the U.S. administration, and revealing confidential and sensitive
information about Iraq's security and armed forces to Israel.

<HEADLINE> Accord Is Lasting Basis for Solution, Milosevic Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic said on Tuesday an agreement was a "lasting basis for a
solution" to the crisis of Serbia's southern province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued from Milosevic's office said a constructive
approach "has been shown that can indubitably represent the
lasting basis for a political solution of autonomy for Kosovo
within Serbia."
</P>
<P>
"The steps which our country is taking to peacefully solve the
problem in Kosovo show our country's firm commitment to overcoming
this problem by political means, as well as its determination to
defend its territorial integrity and sovereignty," said the
statement which was reported by Yugoslav news agency Tanjug.
</P>
<P>
After nine-day tough talks, Milosevic and U.S. special envoy
reached an agreement which allows the presence of international
observers in Kosovo and the return of ethnic Albanian refugees
back home.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic's statement said the talks "focused on the
international community's insistence that specific steps be taken
to ensure the permanent observation and verification of the
development of the situation in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
It added that the task of verification should be carried out by
a mission from the Organization of Security and Cooperation for
Europe (OSCE). A 2000-strong OSCE force is expected to be deployed
in Kosovo to ensure the compliance of U.N. resolution.
</P>
<P>
"Yugoslavia expects that this would eliminate erroneous,
incorrect and ill-intentioned reports of events in Kosovo," it
added.
</P>
<P>
It also said the agreement to allow OSCE mission "will
undoubtedly form the basis of a lasting political solution for
Kosovo's autonomy within Serbia."

<HEADLINE> Hungary Welcomes Political Solution to Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Hungary welcomes the U.S.-
Yugoslav agreement which put on hold a possible NATO air strike
against Yugoslavia over the Kosovo crisis, a senior Hungarian
government official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued at the official Hungarian Journal,
Hungarian Foreign Minister Martonyi Janos said his government
believed more than ever that the Kosovo crisis could be finalized
through a political solution.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hungary also welcomed a delayed deadline for the
implementation of U.N. resolution, which, he said, would help
prompt new possibilities for a peaceful end in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
NATO on Tuesday night authorized air strikes on Yugoslavia at
any time but gave Yugoslav government four days' grace to comply
with all U.N. demands which also include the free access of
international aid agencies in Kosovo and allow thousands of
refugees to go back home.
</P>
<P>
Following the NATO decision, Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic reached an agreement with U.S. special envoy Richard
Holbrooke, which guarantees the withdrawal of Serbian security
forces from Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Exchange Students in Canada Suffers Extensive Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Two British police officers have
uncovered more than 500 cases of sexual and physical abuse which
happened to international exchange students in Canada, the Globe
and Mail newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Detective Chief Inspector Chris Gould and Detective Constable
Kaye Jones have traveled the world for the past four months as
part of their ongoing investigation into the abuse of children on
foreign exchange trips.
</P>
<P>
"This is happening to children around the world, including
Canada," said Gould.
</P>
<P>
Gould and Jones have seen everything from a host family feeding
their exchange students nothing but bread and jam to cases where
convicted children-abusers host exchange students so they can have
free and easy access to children.
</P>
<P>
The study was presented at an Interpol conference on child
abuse in Ottawa last week.
</P>
<P>
The two British officers said among the 500 cases uncovered so
far, only three had ever been reported to police.
</P>
<P>
"Because of the distance from home, the strange environment and
the difficulty for the exchange students, these abuses can be
going on without anyone knowing," said Gould.
</P>
<P>
Among the cases, there was a 17-year-old girl from Australia
who arrived at a small community outside Toronto in 1995. She was
raped by the son of her host family.
</P>
<P>
When the girl reported the rape to the Toronto-based program's
coordinator, she was transferred to another host family and told
not to mention the incident again.
</P>
<P>
The crime was never reported to police and the boy's parents
were never told. And the family can continue to host foreign
exchange students.
</P>
<P>
Gould and Jones are pushing for some sort of government body to
oversee the agencies which operate student exchange programs. They
also recommend parents do their research before allowing their
children to take a company or school trip overseas.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Frees More NLD Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar authorities have
allowed 24 members of the National League for Democracy (NLD) to
go home since September 14 after "view exchanges" with them,
according to a government statement issued here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The government will let more NLD members go home if the NLD
leadership cooperates, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued by the NLD Tuesday, a total of
979 of its party members including 203 parliament
representatives-elect and 776 party organizers have been detained
by the authorities since May 27 this year.
</P>
<P>
The NLD has denied that the authorities had exchanged views
with its detained members, saying that they were, in fact,
"interrogated."
</P>
<P>
On September 16, the NLD formed a 10-member committee
representing the parliament elected in the 1990 multi-party
general election and set up a People's Parliament after its
deadline for the parliament to be convened was ignored by the
government.
</P>
<P>
After the NLD's formation of the People's Parliament, the
government has organized a series of mass rallies in different
states and divisions, denouncing the NLD's move.
</P>
<P>
The NLD said in a letter to the chairman of the State Peace and
Development Council on Tuesday that the authorities are
"illegally" using people from all walks of life who are under
"pressure" for the expression of "the people's desire," creating
further political confusion.
</P>
<P>
The NLD stressed that it reserves the right to organize similar
mass rallies to present facts on the current situation in Myanmar
as it is a legal political party.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Third Plenary Session of
the 15th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC)
was held in Beijing on October 12-14, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The session was atteqded by 185 members and 148 alternate
members, of the CPC Central Committee. Members of the Standing
Committee of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and
leading members of relevant departments attended the session as
nonvoting delegates.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee,
made an important speech at the session which was presided over by
the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
It was held at the session that agriculture, rural work and
farmers are important issues that have a vital bearing on China's
reforms, opening up and modernization drive. To fulfill the grand
trans-century development goals set forth at the 15th National
Congress of the CPC, efforts must be made to further strengthen
agriculture as the foundation of the national economy, maintain
sustained agricultural and rural economic development, ensure the
steady increase of the income of farmers and maintain stability in
rural areas. China's reform first started from rural areas. And
at the time of the 20th anniversary of China's reform and opening
up, and in the face of the impact of the Asian financial crisis
and the challenges arising from economic globalization, it is
timely and necessary for the session to concentrate on studying
agriculture and the rural issues. The session examined and
approved the "Resolution of the CPC Central Committee on Several
Major Issues Concerning Agriculture and Rural Work".
</P>
<P>
Those who attended the session spoke highly of the monumental
achievements and vast experience gained in rural reform over the
past two decades. They were of the unanimous view that the
household contract system with remuneration linked to output,
abolition of the people's commune, the breakthrough in the planned
economy mould and the development of the socialist market economy
have greatly kindled the enthusiasm of hundreds of millions of
Chinese farmers, and emancipated and developed productive forces,
thus bringing the historic, tremendous changes to rural economy
and social development. These great changes have led and promoted
the all-round reforms of the country and have further explored a
road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, which
suits China's actual situation, and have thus made important
contributions to the sustained and fast growth of the national
economy and to maintaining social stability.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Ruling Party Rejects SADC Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho's ruling party
Wednesday rejected a Southern African Development Community
(SADC) proposal to set up a transitional council for fresh
elections.
</P>
<P>
The Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD) said it did not agree
with the proposal because it would be tantamount to overthrowing
the country's constitution, South African Press Association
(SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the SADC proposal, the transitional structure will have
access to information held by the government that is relevant to
the elections. It will also take decisions on all electoral
matters including the role of the police, the military, the
intelligence, finance, foreign affairs, and media and
publications.
</P>
<P>
The powerful structure will review Lesotho's electoral system
and appoint a new Independent Electoral Commission.
</P>
<P>
In a document given to multi-party talks Wednesday, the
governing LCD said: "If the government connives at the
jettisoning of the constitution without assessing the will of the
people, it will be committing fraud on the people of Lesotho and
the electorate, and such act will be considered by history as an
unforgivable transgression."
</P>
<P>
SAPA said it got access to the document.
</P>
<P>
In the document, the LCD said a transitional structure was
irrelevant as the country was not in transition.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho has an elected parliament and government, and an
agreement on fresh elections that will result in a new elected
parliament and government.
</P>
<P>
The LCD said it had no problem with the part of the SADC
proposal outlining the objectives sought to be achieved by the
transitional structure. But it said no such structure could be
established under the present constitution without grossly
undermining the fundamental pillars of the country's
constitution.
</P>
<P>
"If the structure is intended to facilitate the conduct of
free and fair elections, it should be described truthfully as a
structure to facilitate the holding of free and fair elections in
relation to the existing electoral law," the LCD said in a
nine-page response to the SADC proposal.
</P>
<P>
The document said the LCD would argue that nowhere in the
world were political parties empowered to conduct general
elections.

YANGON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar authorities have
allowed 24 members of the National League for Democracy (NLD) to
go home since September 14 after "view exchanges" with them,
according to a government statement issued here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The government will let more NLD members go home if the NLD
leadership cooperates, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued by the NLD Tuesday, a total of
979 of its party members including 203 parliament
representatives-elect and 776 party organizers have been detained
by the authorities since May 27 this year.
</P>
<P>
The NLD has denied that the authorities had exchanged views
with its detained members, saying that they were, in fact,
"interrogated."
</P>
<P>
On September 16, the NLD formed a 10-member committee
representing the parliament elected in the 1990 multi-party
general election and set up a People's Parliament after its
deadline for the parliament to be convened was ignored by the
government.
</P>
<P>
After the NLD's formation of the People's Parliament, the
government has organized a series of mass rallies in different
states and divisions, denouncing the NLD's move.
</P>
<P>
The NLD said in a letter to the chairman of the State Peace and
Development Council on Tuesday that the authorities are
"illegally" using people from all walks of life who are under
"pressure" for the expression of "the people's desire," creating
further political confusion.
</P>
<P>
The NLD stressed that it reserves the right to organize similar
mass rallies to present facts on the current situation in Myanmar
as it is a legal political party.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM Promises New Style in Second Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Australia's re-elected Prime
Minister John Howard promised a new style of government in his
second term Wednesday and warned coalition MPs that the next
election could not be taken for granted.
</P>
<P>
Howard said at the first meeting of Liberal Party MPs and
senators since the October 3 election that the election victory
was more profound than his victory over Paul Keating in 1996, and
the victory exploded many Australian political myths and proved a
government could go to the people with a comprehensive program of
reform.
</P>
<P>
Howard and Treasurer Peter Costello were unanimously re-elected
party parliamentary leader and deputy at the meeting, while Robert
Hill and Richard Alston were appointed Senate leader and deputy
leader respectively.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said he would now turn his mind to
appointing the new cabinet, which is likely to be announced over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would end up with a majority of between
10 and 14 seats in the new parliament, which will meet for the
first time on November 10.
</P>
<P>
Howard said the coalition would have to work hard to win the
next election, which would be fought on different issues and in a
different political environment.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he promised a new-look government which would
put aboriginal reconciliation and social issues high on the
agenda.
</P>
<P>
"I'll be a different prime minister in many ways than I was
last time," he said. "I'll have different goals. I will have come
through a different experience, and I will have different things I
want to achieve."
</P>
<P>
Howard said Australia is now ready for the referendum on the
republic, and whatever the outcome is, Australia would not be
damaged by the process.
</P>
<P>
Despite the upbeat nature of the meeting, Howard warned that
One Nation Party remains a problem for the coalition. "We should
not assume that the threat posed by One Nation, particularly to
the coalition side of politics, has gone."
</P>
<P>
"The One Nation party took about eight or nine percent from us
and delivered half or a bit more of that to the Labor Party via
its preferences. And that of course carries a message for us."
</P>
<P>
He said the coalition has much work to do to encourage One
Nation voters back to the fold.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Optimistic Over Meeting With Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu expressed optimism Wednesday over the upcoming
Israeli-Palestinian summit, saying it could break the deadlock in
the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan, Netanyahu
told reporters that the Israeli government and people hope for the
success of the summit.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is scheduled to meet with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and the United States President Bill Clinton on Thursday in
Washington in a bid to reach an agreement on Israeli further
withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli leader urged the Palestinians to live up to the
commitments to clamp down on Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
A longstanding U.S. proposal calls for Israeli withdrawal from
additional 13 percent of the West Bank in return for Palestinian
crackdown on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have accepted the plan, but the Israelis have
proposed a modification demanding that 3 percent of the land be
turned into a nature reserve where the Palestinians have limited
powers.
</P>
<P>
Hassan expressed cautious optimism about the outcome of the
summit, saying that he hoped the meeting will constitute an
important step towards a breakthrough in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, which signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, is
keen on helping advance the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu arrived here early in the day and returned home after
the talks. This is Netanyahu's first visit to Jordan since
bilateral relations soured in September 1997 due to an
assassination attempt by Israeli secret agents against a Hamas
(Islamic Resistance Movement) leader in Amman.

<HEADLINE> World Cup History Against Primorac By Sporstwriter Cao Jianjie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANTOU, China, October 14 (Xinhua) -- History is not on Zoran
Primorac's side.
</P>
<P>
The world third-ranked Croatian, who won the 1993 and 1997
table tennis World Cup, faces a mission impossible to defend his
crown although he was drawn into an easy group on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
None of the former World Cup winners has successfully defended
his title since the annual event was inaugurated in 1980.
Primorac is no exception, admitted his coach Novakovic Zladtko.
</P>
<P>
Primorac, Qater Open winner and European championships
runner-up this year, was drawn into Group C with South Korean Kim
Taek Soo, Peter Karlsson of Sweden and world No. 59 Liu Song of
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
European champion and world No. 1 Vladimir Samsonov of Belarus
was bundled in Group A with reigning world champion Jan-Ove
Waldner of Sweden, Kalinikos Kreanga of Greece and Oceania
champion Mark Smythe of Australia.
</P>
<P>
World No. 2 Kong Linghui and rising star Ma Lin, both from
China, were drawn into Group B. The other players in this group
are 1994 World Cup champion Jean-Philippe Gatien of France and
African champion Ali Sareh from Egypt.
</P>
<P>
China's Olympic champion Liu Guoliang was pitted against
Jean-Michel Saive of Belgium, Jorg Rosskopf of Germany and Johnny
Huang of Canada in Group D, which the Croatian coach called
"Group of Death".
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to say who are going to snatch two quarter-final
berths in this group," said Zlatko. "Liu has better chance, but I
can't predict the other survivor."
</P>
<P>
The group competition will kick off on Thursday, with top two
players of each group securing quarter-final spots.
</P>
<P>
Zlatko said Primorac was set to make last eight but he didn't
know how far his student would go since.
</P>
<P>
"In the semifinals, Primorac may take on Kong Linghui or Liu
Guoliang and his survival chance is slim," said Zlatko.
</P>
<P>
Chinese head coach Cai Zhenhua tipped Kong as China's only
title hopeful.
</P>
<P>
"Kong is consistent and in form and he is our best chance,"
said Cai.
</P>
<P>
Liu Guoliang is being plagued by shoulder injury while Ma Lin
lacks experience, added Cai.
</P>
<P>
China has won the World Cup for 10 times, with Guo Yuehua and
Ma Wenge each winning twice.

<HEADLINE> A Mountain to  Climb  (by Tan Xinmu) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 14 (Xinhua) -- When Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat begin
Thursday the Washington summit aimed at clinching a deal on the
second Israeli redeployment, they will surely have a big mountain
to conquer.
</P>
<P>
Gaps between the two sides have been narrowed after almost
three months of direct talks and rounds of U.S. mediation, but
differences still remain.
</P>
<P>
While the Palestinians are only demanding that Israel pullback
its troops from another 13 percent of the West Bank as a
U.S. initiative calls for, the Israelis will give them a long list
of tasks they have to work on.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of his departure, Netanyahu has laid out nine
points detailing the specific issues the Palestinians have to
resolve, including fighting terrorism, reducing the Palestinian
force, confiscating illegally-held weapons and annulling those
articles in the Palestinian Covenant calling for destruction of
Israel.
</P>
<P>
On top of the list, meanwhile the harshest, is the demand that
"nothing is settled until everything is settled." To be more
specific, Israel will sign an accord only when the two sides
agree on the whole package.
</P>
<P>
This means that the Palestinians will face a choice in the
negotiations: getting part of the West Bank and making
concessions on many other issues, or getting no land.
</P>
<P>
Even if Netanyahu is determined to climb the mountain to get a
deal, his legs have been, to some extent, shackled by his partners
in his coalition.
</P>
<P>
Accompanying him to the U.S. will be Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon, defender of the interests of the Jewish settlers. Sharon
will take part in the negotiations, but he has already reiterated
that he is against a 13 percent withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Although Netanyahu's cabinet ministers have given him the
mandate to negotiate, they have linked an agreement to
Palestinian security guarantees.
</P>
<P>
While Jewish settlers have been protesting daily over the past
few days and are planning a massive demonstration later Wednesday
to warn Netanyahu against striking a deal with the Palestinians,
the right-wingers in his government have reiterated their threats
to topple the government. Some of the right-wingers have begun to
turn their words into actions.
</P>
<P>
The National Religious Party (NRP), the extreme rightist
coalition party, demanded at a cabinet meeting Tuesday that
Netanyahu not hand over any land to the Palestinians unless they
extradite suspects in attacks on Israelis and revise the
Palestinian Covenant.
</P>
<P>
If the prime minister wraps up a deal without meeting these
conditions, the NRP will bring down the government, party
officials warned.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Land of Israel Front, a group of rightist
legislators crossing party lines, is actively seeking a candidate
to run for prime minister in the next general election.
</P>
<P>
The group announced Tuesday that from the moment the
government decides on withdrawal, it will "move to the
opposition, and will vote no confidence in the government on all
subjects."

</P>
<P>
ARATS and SEF reached a September agreement calling for ARATS
President Wang Daohan and Koo to meet several times to engage in
free exchanges of views on prevailing issues.

told reporters that he was filled with overwhelming excitement
when once again arriving on the soil of the Chinese mainland after
some 53 years.

Moreover, he expressed the hope that his meeting with Wang will
enhance relations between ARATS and SEF, and in turn greatly help
improve cross-Straits relations.
</P>
<P>
Koo is scheduled to leave for Beijing on Friday. President
Jiang Zemin, Vice-Premier Qian Qichen, and Chen Yunlin, director
of the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office, will meet with Koo

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sound Growth, Grim Future for Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The 48 U.N.-designated poorest
countries in the world recorded solid performance last year with
a growth rate exceeding that of the world economy as a whole,
said a U.N. report issued Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, they still have to expect a grim future as their
shares in the world economy continue downwards and the risk of
further marginalization remains high, said a report by the U.N.
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).
</P>
<P>
Gross domestic product (GDP) in these least developed
countries (LDCs) averaged 4.8 percent in 1997, compared with 3.2
percent for the world economy, according to the most comprehensive
report on the world's weakest economies, the 14th one in its series.
</P>
<P>
The LDCs saw GDP increases of 5.5 percent and 4.5 percent in
1996 and 1995 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Despite the modest decline in the growth figure compared with
that in 1996, per capita rise last year benefited two-thirds of
these poorest countries in the world community, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
"Over half of the group -- 25 countries -- have now recorded
real increases in growth for three or more consecutive years,"
the report claimed.
</P>
<P>
In those LDCs which have enjoyed a relatively fast growth for
years, growth now depends less on agricultural expansion than on
the output in industrial sector (in Lesotho and Uganda) or in
services (in Ethiopia and Mozambique), it said.
</P>
<P>
However, poor weather conditions and the Asian financial
crisis took their toll in Africa, and declining commodity prices
on the world market especially undermined African growth, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Lack of export diversification further weakened their
economies following sharp fluctuations in the prices of their
exports intricated by the Asian monetary crisis and their
continued vulnerability to external shocks.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past decade, most LDCs' exports have been limited to
two or three products, almost all of which are sold in raw or
semi-processed form," the report lamented.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, their shares in the world economy continued to
decline. The LDCs' output in 1996 represented less than one
percent of the World's GDP while their export share in 1995 (the
latest figure) was only 0.4 percent, down from 0.5 percent
between 1985-1990.
</P>
<P>
As a group, LDCs received only 1.5 percent of foreign direct
investment (FDI) flowing to developing countries last year. And,
as a percentage of total inflows worldwide, their share was a
minute 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The debt picture in these 48 countries also remain "very
grim." Their combined external debt stood at 134 billion U.S.
Dollars in 1996 (the latest figure) -- a full 90 percent debt of
their combined GDP, down slightly from 136 billion Dollars in
1995.
</P>
<P>
The 48 LDCs, of which 33 are from Africa, have a total
pupolation of over 600 million and an average per capita GDP of
about 230 U.S. Dollars each, according to the lastest U.N. data.

Sixth Asia-Pacific Parliamentarians Environment and Development
Conference between October 15-18.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government Open to Settlement of Marcos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
remains open and prepared to hold informal talks on the settlement
of former president Ferdinand Marcos' ill-gotten wealth, an
official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora made the remarks in response
to recent statements by a member of the Marcoses that they are
backing out of the negotiations with the government.
</P>
<P>
The best solution to the disposing of the Marcos wealth will be
for the family of the late president to settle with the
government, Zamora said at a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that the government can not push the
settlement, "unless everybody is willing to sit down around the
table."
</P>
<P>
"It is possible they (the Marcoses) have changed their minds.
We recognize that everybody has the right to change his or her
mind," Zamora said, stressing that entering into a settlement with
the government is a matter for the Marcos family to decide.
</P>
<P>
Zamora remains hopeful that the Marcos family will still decide
to settle with the government, saying "they may be in the first
flash of, you know, triumph because of the acquittal of Mrs.
Marcos."
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court earlier acquitted former first lady Imelda
Marcos of the graft charges filed against her, saving her from a
maximum jail term of 12 years.
</P>
<P>
Marcos was accused of amassing at least 5 billion dollars
during his 20 years' rule of the country.
</P>
<P>
The government, the Marcoses and human rights victims during
the Marcos regime are trying to sit down together to settle the
570 million dollars of Marcos wealth the government recovered from
Swiss banks early this year.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Politicians Wish Washington Summit Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli politicians expressed
their hope Wednesday that the upcoming Washington summit on
Mideast peace process be successful.
</P>
<P>
The Washington summit between U.S. President Bill Clinton,
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat will begin at the White House Thursday and then the
three-day summit will be moved to Wye Plantation in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
The main topic for the summit is to reach an agreement on
Israel's further troop redeployment in the West Bank and on other
issues concerning the peace process.
</P>
<P>
President Ezer Weizman, through the Israel Radio, expressed
his best wishes to Netanyahu and his delegation, saying the peace
process must be moved forward.
</P>
<P>
Ehud Barak, Israeli opposition Labor Party chairman said that
his party will support the agreement on redeployment if it is
reached.
</P>
<P>
The Labor will support the government on this issue, but that
does not mean the Labor will support the government on
everything, Barak told the Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Israeli former prime minister Shimon Peres said he believes
the Washington summit will produce positive results and the
agreement on redeployment could be signed.
</P>
<P>
Newly-appointed Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon told the Israel
Radio that preparations for the Washington summit will continue
right up to the last moment in the U.S. and it is possible for the
summit to reach a redeployment agreement.
</P>
<P>
But the Israeli delegation should be strong enough to insist
on the Palestinian side to fulfill their commitment in the peace
process, he added.
</P>
<P>
In prepartion for the summit, Netanyahu presided over a long
cabinet meeting on Tuesday and formulated a nine-point principle
for guiding the peace talks in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and Sharon went to Amman Wednesday morning for
pre-summit consultations with Crown Prince Hassan.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese PM Calls for Fight Against Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan
Van Khai gave order to step up fight against smuggling, Vietnam
News Agency (VNA) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Khai, the report said, has instructed Vietnam's leading
officials of relevant ministries and chairmen of the people's
committees of provinces and cities to continue waging the
nationwide fight against smuggling and trade fraud.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese prime minister said that thanks to synchronous
measures taken since early this year, the fight against smuggling
and trade fraud has obtained initial positive results. In the
first nine months of this year, these measures helped restore
order in trade activities, increase budget revenue from taxes, and
promote domestic production.
</P>
<P>
Khai asked relevant ministries, branches and localities to push
up the  fight against smuggling and trade fraud while trying to
maintain trade activities and market prices, particularly prices
of taxed import goods.
</P>
<P>
He asked the Ministry of Public Security to make greater
efforts to detect organized cases of smuggling, contraband goods
trafficking and fraud trade.
</P>
<P>
He added that drastic measures must be taken to fight smuggling
along railway lines, and goods confiscated must be quickly settled
to provide financial support to those fighting smuggling at the
commune and district levels.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,850 cases of smuggling, contraband goods trafficking and
trade fraud were detected by the customs throughout the country
in July and August.

<HEADLINE> Russian Duma Delegation Leaves for Belgrade on Kosovo Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 14 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of the Russian
State Duma, or the lower house of parliament, left here for
Belgrade Wednesday for consultations over the Kosovo issue,
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, which is led by Duma Vice Chairman Sergei
Baburin, aimed "to promote a peaceful settlement and rule out
any use of force" in Kosovo, said Vladimir Zorin, a member of the
delegation and Chairman of the Duma Committee for Nationalities,
at the airport.
</P>
<P>
In Yugoslavia, the delegation is expected to hold talks with
leaders in Belgrade as well as in Kosovo, Zorin said.
</P>
<P>
Comparing the Kosovo crisis with the Chechen conflicts, Zorin
said that "Russia has its own bitter experience which shows that
the use of force in tackling ethnic and territorial problems ends
in deadlock."
</P>
<P>
In the case of Kosovo, Yugoslavia's territorial integrity must
be preserved, and at the same time, the problems of the Kosovo
Albanians must also be solved, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Alexei Arbatov, vice chairman of the Duma Defense Committee and
member of the delegation, said that the Russian deputies' tasks
are to prevent a "unilateral solution of the problem. Peace in the
Balkans means not only calming down the Serbs, but also curbing
the separatists' terrorist activity."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov will fly to
Paris Wednesday evening to attend a session of the Contact Group
foreign ministers, where U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke
would report to them the results of his talks in Belgrade,
Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov has expressed his optimism on the issue Tuesday evening
in an interview with the National TV.
</P>
<P>
Although the situation in Kosovo remains complicated, signs of
advancement toward agreements which may lead to political
settlement of the conflict have appeared, he said.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Kosovo appeared to be slightly heartening
since Holbrooke and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic reached
agreements on the current crisis Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Economic Review: China Stopping Certain Car Levies (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China will have 8-percent
growth this year despite the Asian financial crisis and certain
levies by governmental offices have become a problem.
</P>
<P>
The State Council is telling all governments to stop the
illicit levies on enterprises and individuals and their first
targets are levies on roads and automotives.
</P>
<P>
According to the Finance Ministry, there are more than 2,000
kinds of levies at various levels of government, worth 400 billion
yuan (48 billion U.S. dollars) annually, accounting for half the
Chinese government's revenues.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Machine-Building Industry Bureau, the
amount of governmental fees that an individual pays for a new car
is equal to nearly half the sticker price. If the individual wants
to operate the car as a taxi, the fees are greater than the value
of the car.
</P>
<P>
Yang Zhensheng, an official of the State Machine-Building
Industry Bureau, said that all localities want to draw
profits from the promising car market by introducing excessive
levies on it. He said that excessive levies restricted the car
market by making costs of running a car unbearable for consumers.
</P>
<P>
China's output of automotives dropped markedly in the third
quarter from that of the previous quarter due to decreased market
demands. According forecast by the State Information Center,
China's total demands for automotives will be 50,000 units less
than beginning-of-year prediction.
</P>
<P>
An official in charge of pricing says that the root of the
problem is the interest that government offices have in these
levies and that they always have access to a large part of the
levy revenues.

<P>
Minister of Finance Xiang Huaicheng points out that excessive
levies have not only severely eroded the national tax base and
indirectly reduced revenues, but have created favorable conditions
for corruption.
</P>
<P>
The State Council has instructed the State Development Planning
Commission, the Ministry of Finance and other government
departments to draw up plans to cancel these road and automobile
levies.
</P>
<P>
From the beginning of the new year, most automobile levies will
be eliminated, with only a small number remaining. A large number
will be replaced by taxes and commercial charges similar to taxes.
</P>
<P>
Automobile industry sources say that the industry has long
called for the removal of so-called road maintenance, road and
bridge tolls, passenger transport fees, and purchase levies. The
industry hopes that the government will replace these levies with
fuel taxes and sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
This year, authorities have abolished 29 types of
administrative levies and 147 fund raising programs, which is
expected to reduce the finance burden of enterprises by 13 billion
yuan per year. In the past 12 months, governments at all levels
have cancelled 20,700 types of levies on enterprises, worth 49.3
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Finance, the amount of taxes and
fees that Chinese enterprises paid accounted for 25 to 30 percent
of the GDP, which is higher than for other developing countries.
</P>
<P>
A China Automotive Industry Development Research Center analyst
says that stopping the levies will help infrastructure
construction and promote economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Remove Obstacles to Death Penalty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
acting swiftly to remove legal obstacles to the imposition of
death penalty which was considered a powerful deterrent to
criminality.
</P>
<P>
Justice Secretary Serafin Cuevas said here Wednesday that his
department will present to the Supreme Court this week amendments
implementing rules on the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court upheld on Tuesday the Constitutionality of
lethal injection as the mode of execution in implementing the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
However, the court ordered the Department of Justice to correct
two sections of enabling law for lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
One section suspends the death sentence for pregnant women by
up to three years while the other section requires that the manual
for implementation of the death sentence be kept confidential. The
two sections are inconsistent with other laws.
</P>
<P>
"We have studied the necessary amendments, and will present
them before the high court Wednesday or Thursday," Cuevas said.
</P>
<P>
At least 700 convicts have been sentenced to death for various
heinous crimes since the country resumed the penalty in 1994. But
due to disputes over how to implement the penalty, none of the
criminals has been killed.

<HEADLINE> Supertyphoon Lashes Northern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Supertyphoon "Iliang" spared
Metro Manila but battered several provinces in Luzon, the northern
Philippines, an initial report by the National Disaster
Coordinating Council said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Iliang, with powerful center winds at 265
kilometers per hour, unloaded its fury in Northern Luzon and the
Bicol region.
</P>
<P>
Typhoon signal was raised over Metro Manila but the howler
changed course, sparing it from imminent devastation.
</P>
<P>
Metro Manila only experienced rains the whole day Wednesday.
The rain is expected to last a day or two as Iliang exits from the
country Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The report said 10 electrical posts were uprooted in Isabela,
one of the hardest-hit provinces, while 74 families were forced to
evacuate from their homes in Calabanga, Camarines Sur province due
to rising flood waters.
</P>
<P>
With such a fury, Iliang, the strongest typhoon to hit the
country this year, could bring devastation in its path, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado, who also chairs the
National Disaster Coordinating Council, ordered all provincial
units to prepare for all contingencies, including evacuation of
people and storing food and medicine supplies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the council is closely monitoring lahar flows from
Mount Pinatubo which erupted on June 12, 1991 after being dormant
for 600 years. About 500 people were killed in the most
spectacular volcanic eruption recorded during the past 100 years.
</P>
<P>
No lahar flow has been sighted so far but the rains brought
about by supertyphoon Iliang could trigger a massive lahar flow in
Pampanga, Tarlac and Zambales, particularly in areas near the
dreaded volcano, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Moves to Curb Incursion of Chadian Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's army is conducting a
joint operation in northeastern border areas in conjunction with
Chad and Niger to arrest the incursion of Chadian rebels into
Nigeria, the Defense Headquarters confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Acting Director of Defense Information Lt. Col. Sam Tella was
quoted as saying Tuesday that the move code-named "Operation
Flush Out" is primarily aimed at flushing out Chadian rebels who
have turned bandits and occupying several villages in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
He said the Nigerian Air Force and the land-based forces of
the Army are leading the operation with the Police, Customs,
Immigration and other security agencies involved, The Guardian
newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Chief of Defense Staff Air Vice Marshal Al-Amin
Daggash and the General Officer commanding 3 Armored Divisions
visited the area of operation during the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The Defense spokesman also confirmed that Defense Headquarters
has written to all states of west Africa to beef up security to
arrest any of the rebels who might flee the operational area to
the hinterland.
</P>
<P>
The Chadian rebels are concentrated in the Maduguri area,
northeastern Nigeria, Tella said, adding that "we've cordoned off
the area. We're still in operation."
</P>
<P>
According to him, last week, about 21 persons were killed in a
dawn armed robbery operation by the Chadian rebels who were
believed to invade the country through Bauchi State.
</P>
<P>
In the robbery operation, about 51 vehicles were ransacked and
their occupants forcefully dispossessed of their money and other
belongings.
</P>
<P>
Tella said that "Operation Flush Out" which started on October
1 is being conducted around Lake Chad where the rebels are
believed to have their bases.
</P>
<P>
The operation is embarked upon "in response to appeals for
security of lives and the territorial security of Chad and Niger
who are our immediate neighbors," he noted.
</P>
<P>
For the past several years, Chadian rebels have been engaged
in banditry, armed robbery and generally making life difficult
for Nigerians in many northern states.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Ready to Help With Lesotho Election: Annan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary
General Kofi Annan said Wednesday that his organization was ready
to help Lesotho make the upcoming general election a success,
South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read at multi-party talks in Maseru, Annan
said: "The U.N. stands ready to provide any assistance that will
make the (electoral) process a success."
</P>
<P>
He urged rival political parties in Lesotho to work hard to
resolve outstanding issues so that a climate conducive to free
and fair elections could be created.
</P>
<P>
The talks, chaired by South African Safety and Security
Minister Sydney Mufamadi, began at 10.30 a.m. (0830 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Southern African Development Community (SADC) spokesman Ronnie
Mamoepa earlier said delegates of the ruling Lesotho Congress for
Democracy (LCD) and opposition parties would discuss how to make
sure all parties had an equal chance in Lesotho's elections, to
be held in 15 to 18 months.
</P>
<P>
The parties have said there would be robust debate around the
issue of a government of national unity before the election.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho's general election was held on May 23 this year. But
opposition parties rejected the results, claiming the election
was rigged in favor of the LCD.
</P>
<P>
Protests by opposition supporters since early August pushed
the country into anarchy and finally led to military intervention
by South African and Botswanan troops, under the auspices of the
SADC.
</P>
<P>
The LCD and its opposition rivals agreed on October 2 to hold
fresh elections in 15 to 18 months, but are still wrangling over
who should run the country until that time.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties insist that a government of national unity
should be established, but the idea was rejected by the LCD.
</P>
<P>
During the second round of multi-party talks on October 5, the
SADC proposed a transitional structure alongside the LCD
government. However, it is still not clear whether the rival
parties would accept it or not.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Sets Up Panel on Minimum Wage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
decided to set up a committee to examine the crisis over payment
of new minimum wage in the states.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made Tuesday at a meeting of military state
administrators in Abuja, the federal capital, presided by the
Head of State, General Abdulsalam Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the media after the meeting, Lagos State
Administrator Colonel Mohammed Marwa said the issue of pay parity
among federal and state civil servants was high on the agenda of
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said the committee will submit its report within the month,
adding that before any decision is taken, the administrators have
been ordered to continue negotiating with labor unions.
</P>
<P>
The Abubakar government announced a large-scale salary
increase for federal civil servants starting from September,
including raising the minimum wage from 2,200 Naira (about 25
U.S. Dollars) to 52,000 Naira (about 60 Dollars).
</P>
<P>
But the new salary package does not benefit state civil
servants, as the federal government said their payment should be
decided by state governments.
</P>
<P>
The move has sparked off unrest among state government
workers, who demanded the same minimum wage as their federal
counterparts, and in some cases, have turned to strike to press
their demand.

<HEADLINE> Labor Disputes In Southern Chinese Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The number of labor disputes in
China's Guangdong Province has been increasing since 1995,
affecting the local stable social and economic development,
Guangdong-Hong Kong Information Daily reported recently.
</P>
<P>
There were some 10,000 labor disputes annually from 1991 to
1994, but since 1995, the number has doubled and they have become
even more common in Guangdong. The number went from 927 in 1995 to
1,504 in 1997, and more workers are going in groups to government
departments to voice their complaints.
</P>
<P>
The disputes center on delayed payment of salaries, bad working
and living conditions, overtime without extra pay, on-the-job
injuries, and workers moving to another company with business
secrets. The newspaper quoted a government official as saying that
they were caused mainly by the Asian financial crisis, which
forced some foreign-funded or export-oriented companies to reduce
their workload or close down. The majority occur in private
companies and foreign-funded ones, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a total of 740,000 work days were lost because of
strikes in Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
Some bosses simply fled across the border when the disputes
occurred, leaving behind some cheap equipment and tremendous
problems of calming down strikers, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The government finds itself less prepared to deal with such
large-scale disputes at a time when the labor laws and regulations
are not that mature, the paper said. And many times, the
government has to dig into its own pocket to settle the disputes.

<HEADLINE> China Giving Private Sector More Room (1) Eds: repeat for corrections in the first three paras. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese foreign trade
official said here today that private enterprises in China will be
granted the right to import and export directly, as of January 1.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here say that the importance of the move is not
limited to the private sector's right of direct export and import
itself, it also shows that the private economy has much greater
room for development.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign trade was dominated by state-owned foreign
trade companies until the 1980s, when other state-owned large and
medium-sized enterprises gradually began to enter the business,
but private enterprises still have to go through state-owned
foreign trade companies in import and export trade.
</P>
<P>
Allowing private enterprises to get involved in the business is
just one of a series of government policies supporting the private
economy.
</P>
<P>
A senior State Economic and Trade Commission official said that
China will soon introduce a number of policies that help fund
raising, technical innovations, and personnel training for small
and medium-sized enterprises, which will put all enterprises on an
equal footing, regardless of their form of ownership, so as to
create fairer competition environment for the sake of small and
medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In addition to central government support, more policies are
coming from local governments to encourage the private economy.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan Province has adopted measures to encourage the merger
and acquisition of state- and collectively-owned enterprises by
private enterprises, while Guangdong Province has policies lifting
all restrictions on private enterprises in their operations.

Cook was of the view that if the U.N. Security Council endorses
this agreement it would "make it plain to Milosevic that if he
breaks the agreement he is taking on the whole of the U.N., not

of compliance will provoke NATO to return to pressure on President

<HEADLINE> China Giving Private Sector More Room (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese foreign trade
official said here today that private enterprises in China will be
granted the right to export directly, as of January 1.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here say that the importance of the move is not
limited to the private sector's right of direct export itself, it
also shows that the private economy has much greater room for
development.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign trade was dominated by state-owned foreign
trade companies until the 1980s, when other state-owned large
and medium-sized enterprises gradually began to enter the
business, but private enterprises still have to go through
state-owned foreign trade companies in export trade.
</P>
<P>
Allowing private enterprises to get involved in the business is
just one of a series of government policies supporting the private
economy.
</P>
<P>
A senior State Economic and Trade Commission official said that
China will soon introduce a number of policies that help fund
raising, technical innovations, and personnel training for small
and medium-sized enterprises, which will put all enterprises on an
equal footing, regardless of their form of ownership, so as to
create fairer competition environment for the sake of small and
medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In addition to central government support, more policies are
coming from local governments to encourage the private economy.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan Province has adopted measures to encourage the merger
and acquisition of state- and collectively-owned enterprises by
private enterprises, while Guangdong Province has policies lifting
all restrictions on private enterprises in their operations.

<HEADLINE> China Giving Private Sector More Room (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Economist Lin Jiabin said that, with the growing government
support and more diverse market demand, China's private economy
has new opportunities and more room for development.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of the reforms and opening up 20 years ago,
China's private economy, which started in the service sector, has
developed rapidly into almost every part of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
According to recent government statistics, China has near
30,000,000 private and individual businesses, employing some
70,000,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Private businesses not only are growing in size, but developing
into export-oriented, technology-intensive enterprises.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, the added value of industrial goods
accounted for 17.4 percent, and consumer goods for 37 percent, of
total sales in their respective areas.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Qizai, of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said
that China's private economy has become a major force for economic
stability, as the state-owned enterprises are reformed.
</P>
<P>
But economists also say that China's private economy has not
truly been given enough national backing and the environment in
which it can compete fairly with the government-owned companies
has not been created.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it is extremely important for the government to
provide supporting policies for the private sector.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States Defense
Secretary William Cohen has voiced Washington's readiness to
cooperate with the Gulf states to develop anti-missile rocket
launchers, the Kuwait News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After talks Tuesday in Riyadh with Saudi Defense Minister
Prince Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz, Cohen said that due to the spreading
missile technology in the Middle East, an anti-missile rocket
launching system must be established to protect the interests of
the U.S. and the Gulf countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the news agency said that Prince Sultan denied that
he has discussed with Cohen any potential missile defense network
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said that his talks with Prince Sultan covered issues
including the U.S. policy toward the security in the Gulf, the
situation in Iraq, and regional affairs.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under inspections by the United Nations arms
experts to oversee the dismantlement of its weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Cohen reiterated U.S. commitment to the security of the Gulf,
stressing that Washington is determined to force Iraq comply with
the U.N. resolutions regarding its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Some Enterprises Confess Foreign Exchange Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The State Administration of
Foreign Exchange (SAFE) said today that 344 enterprises have
voluntarily confessed to fraudulent practices in buying foreign
exchange after a decision by SAFE on October 7 urging them to do
so.
</P>
<P>
On October 7, SAFE announced that enterprises that were guilty
of fraudulent transactions that involved less than 5 million
U.S. dollars worth, would be treated leniently if they confessed
their offence voluntarily within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
A SAFE spokesman said that the 344 enterprises confessed to
fraudulent actions worth 773 million U.S. dollars and 46.57
million HK dollars. Some were involved in fraud that was worth
more than 5 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, these enterprises have all said
that they will try to recover the money, which has been remitted
overseas, to reduce state losses.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: India, Pakistan Resume Talks Amid Mutual </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- India and Pakistan are
scheduled to resume talks Thursday in Islamabad after suspension
of exactly 13 months amid mutual suspicion and with little hope
for any breakthrough especially on Kashmir, the most contentious
issue between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries have been tense after the
nuclear tests first by India and then by Pakistan in May this
year, which Pakistan said have further internationalized the
Kashmir dispute that India has insisted as a bilateral issue.
</P>
<P>
The strained relations further deteriorated the following
reports days ago that India is going to stage a large-scale
military exercise near the Pakistan border which evoked strong
reaction from Islamabad accusing New Delhi of vitiating the
atmosphere on the eve of the foreign secretary-level talks.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Pakistani Foreign Ministry said Tuesday that
Islamabad was extremely disturbed by the reports (of Indian
military exercises) particularly by the reported nature, size and
timing of these exercises.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan had already taken up this matter with India and its
High Commissioner Satish Chandra had been told about the Pakistani
concerns, the spokesman told newsmen in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
However, Indian Defense Minister George Fernandes said Tuesday
that the exercises posed no concern to any nation as such
maneuvers were routine with all countries.
</P>
<P>
Western observers are reportedly alarmed at India's plan for
the exercises with 100,000 troops on its border with Pakistan and
they fear that India "might use the exercise to launch an
airstrike against a militant training camp in Pakistan Kashmir".
</P>
<P>
Under such an atmosphere, Indian Foreign Secretary K. Raghunath
leaves for Islamabad Thursday for talks with his Pakistani
counterpart Shamshad Ahmad on peace and security including
confidence building measures and Jammu and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
India's External Affairs Ministry said Tuesday that New Delhi
was looking forward to resumption of the foreign secretary-level
talks with an "open mind" while Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj
Aziz said frankly that no major breakthrough was expected from
these meetings.
</P>
<P>
The Hindustan Times said Wednesday that New Delhi appeared to
be determined to squash any attempt to dovetail the talks to its
current dialogue with the United States and other interlocutors on
the nuclear proliferation regime.
</P>
<P>
Judging by the attitude of the two sides on the eve of the
talks, there is remote possibility of any major progress as the
Kashmir issue, which had led to the breakdown of the talks 13
months ago, continues to be the dividing point as was evident from
the strong statements issued from both New Delhi and Islamabad
recently.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan declared Tuesday that it would speak on behalf of
Kashmir people while India dubbed the statement as utterly absurd
and stressed that Kashmir remains an integral part of India.
</P>
<P>
Jammu and Kashmir is one of the two issues scheduled to be
taken up for discussion during the Islamabad round of the talks
between the two countries while the other identified six issues
will be discussed during talks in New Delhi from November 5 to 13.

<HEADLINE> Germany Favors Thai Official as WTO's New Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This showed support for the Thai government's continued
commitment to open-market policies, German Ambassador to Bangkok
Hermann Erath said in a speech available Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The new government in Germany is still formulating its policy
and it will be clearer later. But from our viewpoint we would want
to see Dr. Supachai as the new director-general," Hermann told a
just-concluded German-Thai Chamber of Commerce meeting.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has launched an international campaign to promote the
appointment of Supachai as WTO's new chief.
</P>
<P>
Hermann, who took up his position recently, said Germany wanted
to raise its profile in terms of supporting the international rule
of law and free flow of goods and capital.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to keep a special focus on Asia and stick to our
well-designed long-term Asian strategy as the region will one day
be a powerhouse for the world again," he said.
</P>
<P>
Germany, he said, would strengthen its businesses' foothold in
key markets in Southeast Asia and, in particular, Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Hermann said a survey of German companies already present in
Thailand revealed that 93 percent were prepared to increase
investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
He urged Europe to create robust domestic demand for products
that would fuel growth in Asia, thereby providing the same kind of
benefits that usually flowed from the United States.
</P>
<P>
The global economy required a reliable framework for the flow
of capital, he said. Bringing interest rates into line throughout
the European Union (EU) would help.
</P>
<P>
Germany has the world's third largest economy and is expected
to take up the EU presidency on January 1 next year. The EU has
about 290 million consumers and accounts for 19 percent of world
economic output and nearly 20 percent of global trade.

<HEADLINE> Prince Ranariddh Proposes Holding Three-Party Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's FUNCINPEC party
President Prince Ranariddh suggested Wednesday that the three
party summit be held in Beijing, China.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to his father King Norodom Sihanouk, Ranariddh
requested the monarch to call the summit in the king's residence
in Beijing at an appropriate time. He insisted safety and
neutrality could not be assured for them at the present time in
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The king responded that he will consult with Cambodian People's
Party (CPP) President Chea Sim and Second Prime Minister Hun Sen,
also the vice president of CPP, about the location of the summit.
"It must be agreed by all three parties," the monarch stressed.
</P>
<P>
King Sihanouk returned to the capital last week for the first
time in nine months and postponed his trip to Beijing for medical
treatment.
</P>
<P>
It was believed the king will leave here for Beijing after his
76th birthday on October 31.
</P>
<P>
However, the royal government of Cambodia did not favor the
plan to hold the summit outside the country.
</P>
<P>
"The government does not agree to hold summit outside the
country because ours is a sovereign state, and it's a Khmer issue,
so it should be held in our own country," government spokesman
Sieng Lapresse said Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The ruling CPP also wants the summit to be held inside the
country.
</P>
<P>
But Khieu Kanharith, CPP spokesman, told Xinhua Wednesday
afternoon, "The CPP supports the position of the government. But
if the king wishes to convene any summit outside the country, we
will follow his decision."
</P>
<P>
Sam Rainsy, president of opposition Sam Rainsy Party (SRP),
Sunday also suggested a summit should be held on "neutral ground",
such as Beijing, where the king is due to have medical treatment,
or other alternative place like Tokyo, Paris and Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Sieng Lapresse stressed that the situation in Cambodia now is
greatly different from the year 1979 to year 1993, during which
there was a war. After the 1993 election, the sovereignty of the
state had been restored and "we have the king to lead the
country".
</P>
<P>
"Another reason why the government insists holding the summit
in the country, is to save money. Cambodia right now is still very
poor. Many people are suffering from hunger," he added.
</P>
<P>
The hoped-for summit, which would be the second called by King
Sihanouk since the July 26 election, is aimed at breaking the
current deadlock and coming to an agreement to form a government
as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The CPP won the elections, gaining a slim majority in the
National Assembly, but lacks the two-third majority needed to form
a new government. Two opposition parties, FUNCINPEC and the SRP,
in parliament have refused to join a coalition.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Important Step Toward Peace in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Serbian government has
proposed a far-reaching package of measures for a political
solution to the crisis in Kosovo, an important step toward
stability and peace in the province.
</P>
<P>
According to the political plan, announced by Serbian President
Milan Milutinovic at a cabinet meeting Tuesday evening, the
Kosovars can have self-rule and a free election will be held
within nine months to establish local authorities to govern
themselves.
</P>
<P>
"The citizens of Kosovo will realize democratic self-rule
through parliamentary, executive and judicial organs of authority
in Kosovo," Milutinovic said at the session which endorsed the
agreement reached earlier in the day by Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, which averted a possible military
operation by NATO, the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe (OSCE) is expected to send personnel to monitor the
situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE officials will travel to Belgrade later this week to
sign the agreement with President Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
According to the political solution, a local police force will be
established, reflecting the ethnic balance of the province, where
90 percent of the population is Albanian.
</P>
<P>
The crisis of Kosovo has haunted the Balkan region since the
Kosovo Liberation Army took up arms to fight for an independent
Kosovo seven months ago. To quell down the rebellion, the Serbian
government has sent thousands of troops into its southern province
to maintain the territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
A local analyst said the political framework was seen as a
proof to the international community and to Kosovar Albanians that
Belgrade intends to implement the agreement announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which guarantees the withdrawal of Serbian
security forces from Kosovo and the deployment of 2,000 OSCE
verification force in the region, is designed to help thousands of
ethnic Albanians who fled their home during the seven-month
conflict.
</P>
<P>
More than 200,000 refugees and displaced people can return home
and the international aid agencies can have freedom of movement
and carry on their humanitarian work without obstruction.
</P>
<P>
The agreement has received welcome at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
President Milosevic said the agreement was important to the
country as it "averts the danger of a military intervention
against our country."
</P>
<P>
"I'm really happy the crisis has been solved by peaceful means
with the maintenance of our territorial integrity," a Yugoslav
government official said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton said the agreement could "lead to
the peaceful resolution of a crisis that threatens stability in
the Balkans and the lives of tens of thousands of refugees, many
of them homeless."
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said, "We welcome the
progress which has been made but there is a lot to be done yet."
</P>
<P>
Russian Presidential Press Secretary Dmitry Yakushkin said in a
statement that "Russia's aim remains the same - a political
solution of the problem, and there is now more optimism about the
possibility of success."
</P>
<P>
After all, Kosovo crisis is a domestic affairs and in the long
run, everything will depend on the Serbs and the ethnic Albanians
to decide their fate.

<HEADLINE> Lao PM On Fulfilling 1998-1999 Socio-Economic Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Lao Prime Minister Sisavath
Keobounphanh has called on his government and local
administrations to fulfill the 1998-1999 socio-economic
development plan, Lao official news agency KPL reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister made the call Monday during a two-day
meeting on the implementation of the socio-economic development
plan and the budgetary plan for the 1998-1999 period.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by government ministers, presidents of
organizations, governors of provinces, the mayor of Vientiane
prefecture, and the chief of the special zone of Saysomboune.
</P>
<P>
Sisavath Keobounphanh said that the materialization of the
socio-economic development plan and the budgetary plan will
demonstrate the capacity and attention of the government, local
administrations, finance and planning officials as well as civil
servants in discharging their duties.
</P>
<P>
At present, the prime minister said, the people are facing
serious difficulties due to the rising cost of living. The people
have pinned their hopes on the government to take measures to
tackle the problems and improve the economic situation,
particularly to curb inflation, stabilize prices and foreign
exchange rates, and expand domestic production.
</P>
<P>
He said if the government achieves the targets of the 1998-1999
socio-economic development plan and budgetary plan, it means that
the government has fulfilled its promise to the people and

<HEADLINE> Large Pit Discovered Near Large Chinese Mausoleum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- A 120-m. by 110-m. pit full of
stone armors has been discovered by Chinese archaeologists near the
mausoleum of China's first emperor, Qinshihuang (259 - 210 BC), at
the largest ancient mausoleum in the world in Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists believe that the pit, which is about 500 meters
from the Mausoleum, was a copy of an arsenal built under the
Mausoleum for the terracotta figures who were imperial guards of
the emperor.
</P>
<P>
Farmers found the pit when the ground in an orchard subsided
when fruit trees were watered and archaeologists dug about 13
meters deep in the western part. It is about the size of pit No.1
of the terracotta warriors and has partitions rammed into the
earth and ashes of wood. The digging also brought up traces of
human activities, like red burnt soil, board ashes, and rammed
earth.
</P>
<P>
The stone armor is burnished and rectangular, round, elliptic,
and trapezoidal, with small holes drilled in two sides. Thin, flat
bronze thread was used to string the pieces together. Some armor
is fine and close, which archaeologists believe means that it was
for high-ranking military officers. Other crude armors were for
ordinary soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Ancient armor was usually made of leather or metal. Stone armor
has never been found in Shaanxi Province and rarely in China.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists also discovered bronze arrowheads and chariot
ornaments. They have never seen any historical documents about the
pit and were both surprised and puzzled by the latest discovery.

<HEADLINE> Somali Commercial Ship Catches Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Latest reports from the
natural port of Blayo, 50 km west of the Somali port town of
Bossaso where a commercial vessel caught fire, said Wednesday
morning that the ship is still burning but has not sunk.
</P>
<P>
The vessel caught fire Tuesday when Somali businessmen were
loading coal on the ship for exporting illegally to Saudi Arabia,
the VHF radio reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports monitored here, huge and dark smoke
could be seen in Bossaso town Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen of its crew members were brought to safety, while
four others including the captain of the ship, Jamal Salah,
remain missing. Thirteen of the crew were Sudanese, two Indians
and one Somali.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of people including militiamen got on to the ship
forcefully and started looting all they could, especially the
electronic equipment aboard.
</P>
<P>
People in the area believe the missing crew were taken away by
gunmen in the area possibly in an attempt to demand a ransom for
their safe release. However, there's no word as yet concerning
their whereabouts as many businessmen and elders from the area
are trying hard to locate them.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the fire is not stated. However, speculations
are that it was deliberately blazed following a serious quarrel
between the Somali businessmen over the quota shares each man
would have on the ship.
</P>
<P>
The fire has started after more than 50,000 quintals of coal
were loaded onto the ship for Saudi Arabia. Many people believed
the ship could have been saved if the militiamen and other
looters did not storm into the ship.
</P>
<P>
Just like the ban on export of wild and female animals, coal
export was made illegal by the Bossaso authorities early last
year.
</P>
<P>
However the exercise did not stop but was moved to the natural
ports in the region and down to southern Somalia especially in
those ports controlled by faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed where
the coal is being exported more than anything else.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The China State Development
Bank (SDB) today issued 10 billion yuan in financial bonds through
public bidding.
</P>
<P>
The three-year bonds have an annual interest rate of 5.94
percent, which will be paid annually.
</P>
<P>
This was the third time the SDB has issued financial bonds
through public bidding since September 2. The bonds issued include
five billion yuan in one-year bonds and 20 billion yuan in
three-year bonds. Revenue from the bonds will be used for key
state construction projects.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the SDB said these bonds are designed for
commercial banks, city cooperative banks, rural credit
cooperatives and insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
The bonds can be traded through inter-bank facilities with
approval from the People's Bank of China, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that issuing bonds through public bidding is the
first step in the reform of China's policy-oriented banks'
fund-raising mechanism, and that it is significant for reforming
China's investment and fund-raising systems and improving
policy-oriented banks' management mechanism.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that since the SDB was founded in 1994 it
has repaid all principal and interest on mature financial
bonds.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi has said the tension between Syria and Turkey is easing
off following the mediation by Egypt and Iran, the official news
agency IRNA reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi told local media Tuesday night that the efforts made
by Egypt and Iran are bearing fruit in getting the two neighbors
to show flexibility toward solving their disputes.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami has sent messages to his
Turkish and Syrian counterparts, helping them see eye to eye on
peaceful solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has accused Syria of sheltering rebels of its outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) fighting since 1984 for an
independent state in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Ankara has demanded that Damascus extradite PKK leaders and
close alleged PKK camps in the Syrian-controlled Beqaa valley of
Lebanon. To exert pressure, it has reportedly massed troops on the
Syrian border.
</P>
<P>
Syria has denied harboring Turkey's Kurdish militants.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi voiced Iran's readiness to continue its efforts to see
Syria and Turkey, both members of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference (OIC), exchanging views directly.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister shuttled between Damascus and
Ankara last week in a bid to seek a peace solution to their row.
</P>
<P>
Iran, which is holding OIC presidency, has urged the two Muslim
countries to settle their disputes through political means in
order not to give opportunities to Islam's enemies to use the
situation.

<HEADLINE> Samsonov Predicts China's Victory in World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANTOU, Guangdong Province, October 14 (Xinhua) -- World
top-ranked
table tennis player Vladimir Samsonov said that China would cash
in on home-court advantage to win the men's World Cup tournanent.
</P>
<P>
The World Cup, which starts on Thursday, will see 16 elite
players vie for 38,000 U.S. dollars champion's purse. Five of
this year's participants have won the annual event.
</P>
<P>
"China is odds-on favorite for this title," said Samsonov from
Belarus. "I will be happy with a semi-final spot."
</P>
<P>
Kong Linghui, world champion and World Cup winner in 1995,
will lead teammates Liu Guoliang and Ma Lin to face assaults from
Europe. Liu was 1996 Olympic and World Cup champion while Ma was
Malaysian Open winner this year.
</P>
<P>
Samsonov, who added European Masters Cup, Croatian Open title
and European Top 12 crown to his European championship this year,
tipped two-time World Cup winner Zoran Primorac and reigning
world champion Jan-Ove Waldner as other title hofefuls.
</P>
<P>
"Primorac's backhand is the best in the world and Waldner has
battle experience and deceptive serve." said Samsonov. "Both are
very difficult to deal with."
</P>
<P>
Samsonov, Primorac and Waldner, the trio who shut out Chinese
from the singles title clash in last year's world championships,
are the biggest threats to host players here, admitted Chinese
head coach Cai Zhenhua.
</P>
<P>
"Three Tigers hold us in awe more or less and they are our
targets," Cai said, referring to the European top trio.
</P>
<P>
"There exists a gap between Chinese players and Three Tigers,
both technically and mentally, and we will have to catch up with
them before the world championships next year," Cai added.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the nickname that Chinese gave him, Samsonov
said: "I've never heard of it. It's sort of funny, but I like it."
</P>
<P>
Former world number one Jean-Michel Saive (Belgium), 1993
world champion Jean-Philippe Gatien (France), Kim Taek Soo (South
Korea),Kalinikos Kreanga (Greece), Jorg Rosskopf (Germany), Peter
Karlsson(Sweden) and Johnny Huang (Canada) are the players who
might not win the title but could cause upsets.
</P>
<P>
At the other end of spectrum are continental champions Liu
Song (Argentina), Mark Smythe (Australia) and Au Saleh Ahmed
(Egypt).

Times of Zambia Wednesday quoted latest statistics released by
Bank of Zambia as saying the inflation levels rose marginally
because of the increase in the prices of maize meal, meat, eggs,
fresh fish, cereal and cereal products.
</P>
<P>
Further increases were recorded in the prices of tobacco,
cement and charcoal.
</P>
<P>
The increase appears to have tilted the Zambian government's
earlier predictions to close the year at nine percent inflation
rate and to enhance the gross domestic product (GDP) growth by
five percent.
</P>
<P>
Now the country's central bank hopes to reduce the inflation
rate toward a macro-economic target of 15 percent and to
guarantee that the GDP growth rate can reach 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The situation, however, has been aggravated by the donors
withholding their balance of payments support compounded by low
export earnings from copper and the non-traditional exports.
</P>
<P>
The donors have not released their pledged aid to Zambia,
saying the country can only receive the money after it privatizes
the remaining assets of the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines
(ZCCM), the traditional foreign exchange earner and financial
pillar.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Southern Africa
Development Community (SADC) countries have postponed a joint
military exercise due to the war in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC), media reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Due to the recent events in the sub-region, it has become
necessary to review the feasibility of conducting the Blue Crane
exercise next November as scheduled previously," Tanzanian
newspaper The Guardian Wednesday quoted a defense ministry
statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
The statement, issued by the spokesman for the Ministry of
Defense and National Service Tuesday, said a new date for the
military games, scheduled to take place in mid-November in South
Africa, will be announced later after the regional situation is
reviewed.
</P>
<P>
Countries which plan to participate in the "Blue Crane"
exercise include Tanzania, Angola, Botswana, the DRC, Lesotho,
Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia and Seychelles, South
Africa, Swaziland and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The operation is to improve the capacity of the SADC military
forces for peace initiatives. Decision to launch the operation
was reached earlier at a meeting of the SADC Inter-State Defense
and Security Committee (ISDSC).
</P>
<P>
At present, four ISDSC members are involved in the war in DRC.
They are the DRC itself, Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe, which are
jointly fighting against rebels who attempt to topple the
government of President Laurent Kabila.

<HEADLINE> End Of Era in Rural China as Oxen Are Retired (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Ploughing and planting
with the use of oxen is slowly being replaced by farm machines in
the rural parts of China.
</P>
<P>
Dang Erhei, a sixty-year-old farmer in Zhaoxian County in Hebei
Province, is faster than other farmers with his ploughing and
planting, even with his oxen, and has a technique that saves seeds.
</P>
<P>
But, he's not as good as he was in the past, especially this
autumn because his son Dang Suxiao has a machine that ploughs,
plants wheat and harvests corn.
</P>
<P>
Cattle, iron ploughs and drills were the major farm implements
in rural China in the past, but, since the reforms and opening up,
the government has increased the development of farm machinery. It
has also supported farmers in buying farm machines.
</P>
<P>
Dang Suxiao spent 60,000 yuan on his harvester, which brings
about 10,000 yuan in profits annually. Dang gets a bonus and
subsidy from the local government for the purchase. In his
hometown, 82 percent of the 80,000 rural households have tractors
and other implements.

Dang said that nearly 1,000 rural households have harvesters
and not only help harvest corn at home, but also help harvest
wheat in neighboring Henan Province and the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
In the country, ploughing, irrigation, plant protection,
threshing, processing and transportation are now basically done by
machines.
</P>
<P>
China has plans to increase agricultural mechanization in
backward areas in the 1996-2000 period, and Dang said that the
days of people like his father have passed.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural mechanization has freed more rural people from
farming and pushed them into the service sector.
</P>
<P>
There are 36.8 million farmers using agricultural machinery in
rural China who have become an important force for agricultural
modernization and industrialization.
</P>
<P>
A study by the State Council's development and research center
reveals that mechanization has also helped develop the breeding
industry and increase farm output.
</P>
<P>
Xu Fengxian, a researcher of the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, says that the rapid agricultural mechanization has been
important in agricultural modernization and in developing China's
industrial and service sectors.

that there would be no deal if the Palestinians do not begin
fulfilling their security commitments. In a statement released
after an Israeli man was shot dead and another seriously injured,
Netanyahu said he would demand that Palestinian National
Authority President Yasser Arafat act immediately to apprehend the
assailants if they fled into Palestinian-controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Senior U.S. officials have informally asked Israel to
consider accepting the principle of an eventual Palestinian state
as part of a final summit document next week. According to the
U.S. idea, in return for accepting the idea of a Palestinian
state in principle, the exact powers and geography of the
proposed state would be defined through negotiations, the May 4th
deadline for completion of the interim agreement period and
implementation of the final status would be postponed.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- About 8,000 dunams (some 4,000 acres) of forests have
been destroyed by fires in a number of areas in Israel over the
past few days. The General Security Service is investigating
whether these fires were caused by arson while senior military
officials said that some were caused deliberately.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- A country representative of
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has disclosed that over
80 percent of the food in Africa is produced by women.
</P>
<P>
While officiating Tuesday at World Food Open Day celebrations
under the theme "Women Feed the World", George Mburathi told the
villagers near Kabwe, 150 kilometers north of Lusaka, that women
play a critical role in food security in Africa, The Post
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Over 50 percent of the food produced in the world is by women
and 80 percent in Africa is produced by women," Mburathi said. "
Despite all these efforts they are not recognized because their
production levels are not even reflected in some statistics made
so far."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out if the women can be supported in attaining
their expectations, the hunger situation in Zambia and Africa in
general could be reduced.
</P>
<P>
Mburathi said there is a lot of potential in Zambia that the
women can utilize. He called on the Zambian women to produce more
food and try to feed the whole nation.
</P>
<P>
Zambia, which has a population of 9.6 million and a vast
cultivatable land, imports a large amount of maize each year with
its limited foreign reserves.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Henan Province in central
China will give equal emphasis to the upgrading of existing power
plants and the building of power grids over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The province will build six new power plants with an aggregate
generating capacity of 4.3 million kw over the coming years.
Feasibility reports on the construction of the new plants have won
state approval, according to information from the Provincial
Development Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
It will take five years to complete power-grid upgrading in the
province's urban areas, and three years to complete power-grid
construction and upgrading in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
An official with the commission said they warmly welcome
overseas investors' participation in the province's power
development plan, while at the same time they strive for more
funding from the state.
</P>
<P>
By 1997, Henan had a combined generating capacity of 11.72
million kw. The total generating capacity of the province is
expected to rise to 13 million kw by the end of this year, 15
million kw by 2000, and 17 million kw by 2002.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Zambia's delayed mines sale Concerned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Association of Chambers
of Commerce and Industry (ZACCI) is worried that another quarter
of the year has gone without positive resolution on the sale of
Nkana and Nchanga mines because this is only prolonging business
pessimism and low activity.
</P>
<P>
Daily Mail Wednesday quoted ZACCI chief Gerry Chabwera as
saying that the delay in the sale of mines will further delay the
release of balance of payment support which is critical to the
stability of the exchange rate of Zambia's currency.
</P>
<P>
"Government is forced to draw upon its meager resources to
meet commitments that will otherwise be funded by aid and this
exacerbates a serious funding gap. That deficit contributes to
rising interest rates, which worsen the economic environment," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Chabwera said that Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) and
the government's severe cash flow problems, their non-payment and
delayed payment of creditors have been the major factor in the
liquidity crunch which is causing economic recession.
</P>
<P>
ZCCM said in its latest half-year report that it had a loss of
126.6 billion Kwacha (about 63 million U.S. Dollars) as compared
to last year's 17.9 billion Kwacha (about nine million Dollars).
</P>
<P>
He also expressed concern at the late arrival of fertilizer
for the forthcoming farming season.
</P>
<P>
He further said employment creation, investment promotion and
the stimulation of both local and foreign demand for Zambian
products are crucial to the revival of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Last May donors pledged to provide Zambia with an aid of 530
million Dollars at the Consultative Group meeting held Paris.
However, Germany and the Netherlands has made it clear that they
will not release the pledged aid until the completion of the
privatization of the ZCCM, which earns more than 80 percent of
Zambia's foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
German ambassador Helmuth Schroeder to Zambia said that it
will be economically imprudent if the assistance is released
before the privatization process of ZCCM is completed.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the Money ZCCM is losing equals to the
amount of the aid the donor community pledged to give Zambia and
that if it is released, it will have no impact on its economy and
serve no purpose because all of it will go to bailing out the
ailing ZCCM.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government has been trying to quicken the
privatization of ZCCM but failed to complete the process in the
first half of this year as planned.
</P>
<P>
Due to disagreement over the cost of Nkana and Nchanga mines,
two biggest mines of country, Zambia discontinued the
negotiations with the Kafue consortium last April over the sale
of the two mines, which accounts for 65 percent of ZCCM assets.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown not only affects ZCCM itself but affects other
sectors as well which had links with ZCCM. ZCCM has cut down its
orders of various manufactured goods. Output of the manufacturing
sector decreased by 10 percent to 15 percent in the first four
months this year.

<P>
TOKYO, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices continued falling in
Tokyo Wednesday on fears that a government plan to refuel
capital-short major banks may fail to ease the country's severe
credit crunch.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 172.06 points, or 1.30
percent, from Tuesday's close to end at 13,070.73.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, sank 14.80 points or 1.48 percent to 984.18.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section decreased to about 358 million
shares from Tuesday's 506.62 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Nissho Iwai Corp. was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Bank and brokerage shares led the decline, while domestic demand
sectors, including steel and construction, also slumped. But
export-linked automobile and precision instrument shares rebounded on
buybacks following their sharp declines last week on the surging yen.
</P>
<P>
Analysts voiced skepticism about whether the government's bank
bailout plan, which doubled the amount of available public funds from
30 trillion yen (about 252.1 billion dollars) to 60 trillion yen
(about 504.2 billion dollars), would spur banks to ask for a capital
refueling.
</P>
<P>
A bank which asks for a capital boost may be required to have its
executives step down. According to news reports, applicant banks must
submit plans to "clarify management's responsibility" for their
bad-loan problems.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,344 issues listed on the First Section, losers outnumbered
gainers 777 to 330, with 177 issues remaining unchanged.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Study Suggests Cancer Often Undiagnosed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 13 (Xinhua) -- A study of autopsy results
at a U.S. hospital found that cancer was often missed or
misdiagnosed by doctors.
</P>
<P>
The study, published in the latest issue of the Journal of the
American Medical Association, said a team of researchers reviewed
the records of more than 1,100 people autopsied at the Louisiana
State University Medical Center in New Orleans between 1986 and
1995.
</P>
<P>
Autopsies found 250 malignant tumors in 225 patients, but
clinicians had correctly diagnosed only 56 percent of these
tumors, according to the researchers, led by Dr. Elizabeth
C. Burton.
</P>
<P>
"One hundred eleven malignant neoplasms in 100 patients, or 44
percent of cases, had been either undiagnosed or misdiagnosed,"
Burton and colleagues write.
</P>
<P>
They said that they focused on cancer diagnoses, but it is
likely that other diseases and disorders were also misdiagnosed or
undiagnosed.
</P>
<P>
The researchers urged to revive the long-abandoned practice of
performing routine autopsies in U.S. hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Autopsies often are done when death results from accident, foul
play or when cause of death is a mystery. However, the procedure
is performed only 5-10 percent in teaching hospitals today,
compared to 50 percent in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Some clinicians argued that technological advances have made
clinical diagnoses more accurate, and thereby made postmortem
diagnoses less essential.
</P>
<P>
But Burton and colleagues conclude that their findings
underscore the value of autopsies.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China's shipbuilding output
increased to 3.85 million tons in 1997, ranking third in the world
and up from 860,000 tons in 1978 when the reform and opening
policy was initiated.
</P>
<P>
The country's 740 shipbuilding enterprises achieved a combined
industrial value of 26.26 billion yuan last year, according to the
State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
China is now able to produce the vast majority of ships needed
for overseas and domestic customers, including high-speed vessels and
large container vessels, said an official from the China State
Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC).
</P>
<P>
The country had a very weak ocean-shipping fleet before 1970,
with 70 percent of its foreign-trade transport volume accomplished
by renting foreign vessels.
</P>
<P>
In 1970s, China built 86 vessels above the 10,000-tonnage
level, with an annual shipbuilding output of 150,000 tons on
average. From 1979 to 1988, the country produced nearly 1.4
million tons of vessels annually on average, and its ship exports
climbed. During the 1990s China's shipbuilding industry has grown
rapidly under sound international market conditions.

<HEADLINE> Anwar Freed From ISA Detention, but Remanded in Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Former Malaysian deputy
prime minister Anwar Ibrahim was freed Wednesday from detention
under the Internal Security Act (ISA), but taken to the Sungai
Buloh Prison for remand, police said.
</P>
<P>
Confirming this, police officer Yaacob Mohamed Amin of the
police headquarters here said police obtained the order for
Anwar's remand Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who was charged with five counts of corrupt practice and
five counts of unnatural sex acts, is being remanded because his
application for bail on four charges of corrupt practice has been
rejected by the High Court. Anwar filed an appeal against the High
Court decision Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who pleaded not guilty to all the charges, goes on trial
on four charges of corrupt practice on November 2. Trial dates for
another count of corrupt practice and five charges of sodomy have
yet to be fixed.
</P>
<P>
Anwar was sacked as deputy prime minister and finance minister
on September 2 and was arrested here by police under ISA on
September 20 after he addressed an alleged illegal assembly of his
supporters which resulted in riots in the capital city.

<HEADLINE> China Telecom Dismayed By Cold Reception Of Discount Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China Telecom has expressed
disappointment over poor market reception of its offer of 70
percent discounts for domestic direct dial (DDD) telephone calls,
according to today's Beijing Daily.
</P>
<P>
China Telecom started a 70 percent discount for DDD calls made
from midnight to 7 am, beginning on July 1 until June 30, 1999,
assuming that business volume would surge with customers taking
advantage of the cheaper rate.
</P>
<P>
However, the offer generated a volume rise of only 25 percent
in the first three months, a rate called "meager" by the
state-owned company.
</P>
<P>
To discover why, the company conducted a sample survey of 100
customers. They said they would not call anyone during the
70-percent-discounted hours, while 50 percent of them would make
calls between 9 pm and midnight, when a 50 percent discount is
offered.
</P>
<P>
They said both the caller and the person being called should be
sleeping in the midnight-to-7-am period and it is particularly
impolite to call someone so late.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said it believes the company will revoke the
discount if the market continues to turn a cold back on this offer
after the one-year trial period expires.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian veterinarian has
successfully treated an orangutan suffering from Hepatitis C at a
research center in Indonesia's East Kalimantan province and is
treating 11 more orangutans.
</P>
<P>
"We were delighted with Dr. Header Davis' success and we hope
that he would be able to treat the other orangutans," the
Wanariset Sambodja Research Center's head Adi Susilo said.
</P>
<P>
Susilo said he did not know what drugs Dr. Davis used.
</P>
<P>
"What was obvious was his tirelessness in treating the
orangutans," he was quoted by Antara News Agency Wednesday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the 11 orangutans still suffering from Hepatitis
C were quarantined in an area surrounded by a 1.5-meter wall to
prevent the disease from spreading.
</P>
<P>
"It is true that this disease does not spread easily. But there
is a chance the sick orangutans could transmit the disease if they
come into contact with the healthy orangutans -- even with human
beings," he said.
</P>
<P>
Some diseases may affect both orangutans and human beings.
These include diarrhea, flu and cough, he explained.

<HEADLINE> Supermarkets Gaining Popularity in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Supermarkets in this economic
and financial center of China have become the most frequently
patronized places for the purchase of food and daily necessities.
</P>
<P>
Some 67 percent of Shanghai residents buy food, beverages and
pastry at supermarkets, while 66 percent of the residents buy
other daily necessities in them, according to an official survey
conducted by the municipal statistics bureau.
</P>
<P>
Many of the survey respondents say they choose to go to
supermarkets for these items because of cheaper prices, more
varieties and convenience.
</P>
<P>
Supermarkets first appeared in Shanghai in the early 1990s and
have gained popularity amid rapid expansion in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that the 28 chain-store supermarkets in
Shanghai had a combined 8.1 billion yuan in retail sales last
year, about 6 percent of the city's total retail sales of
consumer goods in 1997. The retail sales volume of
these supermarkets, which have more than 1,000 outlets and 24,000
employees, exceeded 10 billion yuan in the first nine months
this year.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts say that supermarket sales of food and daily
necessities now face fierce competition and have limited room for
further expansion, but sales of building materials, household
electric appliances and children's goods still have bright
prospects.

<HEADLINE> Water Conservation Vital to Keep Yellow River Flowing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists are pointing
out that water conservation and long-term diversion projects are
vital for maintaining the uninterrupted flow of the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
The worsening drought on the lower reaches of the river has
attracted nationwide attention, as scientists from the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (CAS) visited four provinces on the lower and
middle reaches of the river in July to document existing
problems. They warn that interrupted flow may result in disastrous
floods and drought in the next century.
</P>
<P>
"Water conservation should be the current measure to ease the
shortage of water resources in the valley, especially in irrigated
areas relying on water drawn from the river," said CAS academician
Liu Changming.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 percent of the water pumped from the river is used
for agricultural irrigation, but outdated diversion facilities and
irrigation methods has resulted in a low water utilization rate of
25 percent, compared with 50 percent in areas irrigated by well
water.
</P>
<P>
Experts have suggested raising water prices according to
quality and quantity so that a sense of water conservation can be
established. At the same time, the recycling rate of water for
industrial purpose must be increased with more industrial waste
water disposed.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that most parts of the river valley are arid areas
without much rainfall. "Considered from a long-term point of view,
diversion projects are necessary to supply water to the Yellow
River," he added.
</P>
<P>
A plan proposed in 1950s envisioned channeling water from the
Yangtze, China's longest river, to northern areas and to the
course of the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that one idea gaining wide acceptance is boring
tunnels to channel water from the upper reaches of the Yangtze
River, or the Tongtian, Yalong and Dadu rivers, into the upper
reaches of the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
Another idea is to channel the Daning River, a tributary of the
middle reaches of the Yangtze, northward into the Yellow River
near the central China city of Zhengzhou.
</P>
<P>
Even though these large-scale projects will need huge
investments and involve technical problems, Liu urged a
feasibility study and preparatory work on these projects as soon
as possible.

<HEADLINE> New Offshore Oilfields In China's Bohai Bay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese geologists have
discovered three medium-sized oilfields at Shijiutuo in Bohai Bay
with 60 million tons of proven oil reserves and 8 billion cubic
meters of gas, an official announced here today.
</P>
<P>
During recent trial operations, they produced 310,000 cu.m. of
gas and 190 cu.m. of oil a day, making Shijiutuo the largest
offshore oil producer in China. It has more than 300 million tons
of proven reserves, said Deng Yunhua, a geologist there.
</P>
<P>
Shijiutuo covers 600 sq. km. in central Bohai Bay, 100 km. from
Tanggu Port and 20 km. from Jingtang Harbor. All 5 oilfields in
the region produce heavy oil, buried in a layer from 20 m. to 60
m. thick.
</P>
<P>
The China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) and the
U.S. Texaco and ARCO are planning to undertake oil exploration in
the Qinhuangdao 32-6 oilfield, which has a production period of 20
years.
</P>
<P>
CNOOC will do the actual exploration and the two U.S. companies
will play a supporting role. The Chinese will be responsible for
51 percent of the cost, with the remainder being covered by the
two U.S. companies.

<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Corn, soybean and wheat
futures prices surged Tuesday following Agriculture Secretary Dan
Glickman's confirmation of a food aid package for Russia.
</P>
<P>
At the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, corn for delivery in
December was eight cents higher at 2.28 U.S. dollars a bushel;
November soybeans were 6.5 cents higher at 5.635 dollars a bushel;
December wheat was 5.75 cents higher at 2.96 dollars a bushel.
</P>
<P>
Glickman, who discussed food shortages with the Russian
ambassador last week, said that U.S. and Russian officials met
Tuesday to discuss an aid package.
</P>
<P>
"It is in our interest as a nation to provide help and
assistance" to Russia, which is faced with one of its worst
harvests in 40 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
There has been talk of food aid for Russia in recent weeks, so
the idea is not new. "But each time the market hears about it, the
prospects seem to solidify a little bit," said Don Roose,
president of U.S. Commodities Inc.
</P>
<P>
There have been reports that Russia is seeking up to 3.3 million

<HEADLINE> Remote Xinjiang Becomes Haven for Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region has emerged as a haven for overseas investment in an
underdeveloped part of China.
</P>
<P>
The northwestern region has attracted some 400 overseas
companies from around the world to make use of its wool, cotton,
oil and gas.
</P>
<P>
Although the region was on an international trade route in
ancient times, its position declined in this century because of
its remoteness. This has been remedied, however, by the opening-up
drive and massive development in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The first overseas investors concentrated on tourism and food
and brought Kentucky Fired Chicken and Holiday Inn to the
region. The wool industry has also been a draw, with a Hong Kong
investor funding a spinning venture in the early 1980s in the
first overseas joint venture in China's textile industry.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, its grain, cotton and oil have become
attractive to investors from America, Europe, Southeast Asia and
countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States.
</P>
<P>
Overseas funding has also helped reclaim 550,000 hectares of
waste land, or a third of the country's reclaimable waste
land.

</P>
<P>
He urged local technicians to work closely with those of fellow
members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) like
Singapore and Malaysia in preparing to carry out the related
projects,
</P>
<P>
At an information technology forum here Tuesday, sponsored by
the XYBASE Technologies of Malaysia and the Mastech Co Ltd of

<HEADLINE> Ordinary Chinese Farmer Becomes Multi-Millionaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China's rural policies in recent
years have turned a group of poor but diligent and hardworking
farmers into millionaires or even billionaires.
</P>
<P>
Han Wei, a 43-year-old chicken-farm owner in northeast China's
Liaoning Province, is one of them.
</P>
<P>
Impelled by the more flexible government policies, Han borrowed
3,000 yuan from his neighbors as capital to start a family chicken
farm in 1984.
</P>
<P>
"When we first set up the farm," he said, "all we had were the 50
chickens. My wife fed them in the courtyard as she carried our son on
her back. Sometimes, a mischievous chicken leapt on his head,
pecking at his hair."
</P>
<P>
Fourteen years later, the 50 chickens have become 1.5
million. And Han's fixed assets have soared to 500 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Now the entire process, including feeding, excrement cleaning,
coop-temperature regulation and sterilization has all been
automated.
</P>
<P>
As raising chickens involves genetics and a knowledge of
nutrition, environment and management, Han has invited experts
from both China and abroad to offer technical guidance. He also
obtains information from the Internet each day and goes abroad
each year to survey the market.
</P>
<P>
He has opened more than 80 egg shops in Dalian, meeting half
that city's market demand.
</P>
<P>
With accumulated funds, Han has invested 130 million yuan to
set up a company dealing in rare Pacific seafood.
</P>
<P>
He also bought a three-room flat in downtown Dalian and a Mercedes
car, and plans to send his son and daughter abroad to study in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
"There would be no stunning success of today without economic
reforms and the Party's opening policy," Han said.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the period of food shortages, Han said, "Eggs used to
be saved for women in confinement and rare guests in most
families. Even in major cities like Beijing and Shanghai, eggs
were rationed, 0.25 kg for each urban resident per month on
average."
</P>
<P>
"But now, eggs are a common food in both urban and rural
areas. The per capita annual consumption of eggs in Liaoning
averaged 24 kg last year," he added.
</P>
<P>
The welcome change derived from the national fundamental shift
from a planned economy to a market-oriented economy offers
excellent opportunities for industrious Chinese farmers who have
worked in the fields for generations.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Psychological Report Excerpts (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Following are the excerpts
from the summary of Mike Tyson's psychiatric report for the
Nevada Athletic Commission, which was prepared by Dr. Ronald
Schouten of Massachusetts General Hospital:
</P>
<P>
Mental Status Examination by Drs. Schouten and David
Henderson:
</P>
<P>
Throughout the five-day evaluation period, Mr. Tyson
repeatedly indicated his sense of responsibility to his family
and community, as well as his feelings of guilt over his own
success.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Tyson reported that "I have no self esteem but the biggest
ego in the world." Upon further exploration, he was aware that
his inflated ego was a psychological defense to his poor
self-esteem. He stated that he is uncomfortable with his
celebrity status, indicating "I don't want super stardom."
</P>
<P>
Mr. Tyson reported his mood as being depressed. His affect was
marked by instability, with a tendency to shift over the course
of the day in response to events in his life. He reported that he
experiences several symptoms of depression, and that these are
chronic.
</P>
<P>
He reported these symptoms to include depressed mood,
decreased energy, feelings of gult, and increased appetite. Mr.
Tyson denied a desire to harm himself or others. He noted that he
feels better when training and doesn't find fighting stressful.
He gave a history of periods of increased energy and rapid
thoughts, although these were not confirmed by his wife.
</P>
<P>
He reported feeling anxious and described a state of
hypervigilance (hyperalertness to the people and events around
him) which he attributes to the number of times his trust has
been betrayed. Other than this general level of alertness, there
are no other indicators of an anxiety disorder, including
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. Mr. Tyson denied symptoms of a p
sychotic disorder and no sings or symptoms of psychosis were
detected. He specifically denied episodes of dissociation,
macropsia, dejavu, hypergraphia, or olfactory hallucinations. Mr.
Tyson did not report or exhibit signs and symptoms of
Intermittent Explosive Disorder.
</P>
<P>
During the course of the evluation, Mr. Tyson was anxious at
times and very aware of the activities around him, as well as
sensitive to their implications. Mr. Tyson was open and direct
throughout the evaluation. Part of his openness and honesty,
however, was to express clearly to us his sense of humiliation at
being asked to undergo an evaluation by mental health
professionals. He reported being deeply embarrassed that everyone
knew he was here and at the possibility that people would think
he was "psycho." He expressed his frustration at being required
to undergo this evaluation, which he believes to be
unprecedented. In spite of this degree of humiliation and
frustration, Mr. Tyson did agree to proceed with the evaluation
and cooperated with the process. There were times, particularly
early on, when his anger over the process made it difficult for
him to continue. Appropriate breaks were taken at that thime and
Mr. Tyson was able to continue. Additional breaks were taken
throughout th efive days of evaluation as a result of the mental
strain and fatigue caused by the pressured setting, especially by
the psychologicl and neuropsychological testing.

have a normal neurological evaluation. He did exhibit some
difficulties with "Working memory, sequencing and switching
sets...and some difficulty with perseveration... These findings,
minor though they are, are consistent with a problem of the
executive control system. There is no accompanying
electrophysiologic abnormality as shown by the EEG, or anatomic
abnormality as shown by the normal MRI."
</P>
<P>
The neuropsychological testing administered by Dr. Thomas
Deters indicated that Mr. Tyson is a man with a mixture of
cognitive strengths and weaknesses. His relative weaknesses are
in the areas of attention, short term/working memory, verbal
learning and memory, and fine motor coordination. He also has
deficits on some select measures of executive control. Dr. Deters
notes that Mr. Tyson has both emotional and executive control
problems. These executive control problems are not of such degree
that they would prevent Mr.Tyson from appropriate participation
in boxing if he is able to address his emotional issues.
</P>
<P>
Psychological Evaluation:
</P>
<P>
The results of the psychological evaluation conducted by Dr.
David Medoff revealed Mr. Tyson's moderate depression,
self-criticism, irritability, anger, individualism, and
difficulty in interpersonal relationships. His profile was
consistent with those of people who experiene anger and
irritability but are ordinarily able to control these feelings.
It also revealed a tendency to rely on others to a greater extent
than expected, as well as naivete in these relationships. The
testing did not suggest the presence of any major mental illness
or personality disorder. These findings are consistent with our
clinical observations.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Children Study in World-Roof School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Nearly all the children in Phari
Town on the roof of the world in the Tibet Autonomous Region are
able to study at the Qingpu Primary School free of charge because
of aid from Shanghai and the local government.
</P>
<P>
Tsedo, deputy headmaster of the primary school, said he is very
pleased to see the youngsters going to school every morning.
</P>
<P>
He said that among the 55 graduates this year, 43 entered the
Yadong County Middle School and five were selected to study in
other provinces.
</P>
<P>
According to Tsedo, 17 of the 19 teachers here are college or
polytechnic school graduates.
</P>
<P>
Phari Town, at an elevation of 4,370 meters, used to be sealed
by snow for more than five months a year due to poor transport and
telecommunication condition. And because of the poor education
facilities, many children worked as cowherd for their families
instead of going to school.
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the education department of Xigaze Prefecture invested
400,000 yuan to improve the teaching facilities there. And in 1996
Shanghai's Qingpu County offered 500,000 yuan to set up the Qingpu
Primary School.
</P>
<P>
The school now has 309 pupils in nine classes consisting of six
grades. Their tuition fees, 70 to 80 yuan per school year, are
paid by the government. The school offers some 10 subjects
including Chinese and Tibetan languages, mathematics, history,
music and physical culture.

<HEADLINE> India's Industrial Production Growth Slows Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- India's industrial production
registered a growth rate of only 2.4 percent in August compared
with the 5.2 percent in the same month last year but it showed a
marginal improvement compared with the 1.7 percent registered in
July.
</P>
<P>
Cumulative industrial growth this year (April to August) dipped
to 3.5 percent from the 5.5 percent in the previous year,
according to the latest figures for index of industrial production
(IIP).
</P>
<P>
The IIP released Tuesday by the Central Statistical
Organization showed that the cumulative growth in industrial
production has declined consistently during the current financial
year from 5.4 percent in April-June to 4 percent in April-July and
the present level of 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Main reason behind the downslide was the poor performance of
the manufacturing sector which accounts for almost four-fifth of
the total weight of the IIP.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector recorded a growth of 2 percent in
August against the 4.8 percent during the same period last year.
So far in the year, the sector recorded a growth rate of 3.2
percent compared with the 5.4 percent in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
The decline in industrial growth was more evident in use-based
classification with capital goods and consumer goods segments
recording negative growth rates in August.
</P>
<P>
Capital goods segment recorded a negative growth rate of 1.6
percent against the 8.6 percent during the same period last year,
while consumer goods segment declined by 1 percent during the
month compared with the 4.1 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
From April to August, capital goods and consumer goods segments
recorded a growth of 4.8 percent and 1.7 percent respectively over
the same period the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Growth in mining sector also remained subdued during the month
at 0.6 percent compared with the 5.5 percent last year. The
cumulative growth during the period was low at 0.5 percent against
the 5 percent in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
Though the electricity sector posted an impressive growth of
7.5 percent in August, it was still below the 8.7 percent achieved
during the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, consumer non-durables registered a negative growth
rate of 1.5 percent in August against the 4.3 percent in the same
period last year, but the cumulative growth during April to August
stood at 1.9 percent compared with a negative growth rate of 0.3
percent for the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Growth rate of consumer durables declined to 0.3 percent in
August this year compared with the 3.7 percent in the same month
in 1997 and the cumulative growth during April-August also
declined significantly to 0.6 percent against the 5.7 percent in
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The Center for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), an independent
forecaster, said Monday that growth rate of the Indian economy
would drop to 4.5 percent in 1998-99 from an earlier projection of
5 percent due to a decline in agricultural production and a
substantial slowdown in the industrial and service sectors.
</P>
<P>
Growth rate in 1997-98 had also been revised downwards from 5.1
percent to 4.5 percent, according to CMIE's monthly review for
September.
</P>
<P>
The forecast is sharply lower than the 6.5 percent projected by
the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the central bank of the country,
and the government's expectation of 6.5 to 7 percent growth for
1998-99.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures released by the Confederation of Indian Industry
(CII) also showed that the majority of Indian industries had less
than 10 percent or negative growth rate in the first half of the
current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The biggest slump had been experienced by the automobile sector
which saw a 41 percent dip in commercial vehicles production, 53
percent in middle and heavy commercial vehicles, 20 percent in
light commercial vehicle and three percent in cars.
</P>
<P>
Growth in the basic goods sector also remained depressed with
only 2.5 percent increase in aluminum, 5.4 percent in cement, 5.2
percent in fertilizer but the production of cold rolled steel and
lead and lead alloy decreased 2.5 and 13 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
CMIE's revised growth projections for 1998-99 indicate that the
service sector would grow at 6 percent against the earlier
forecast of 7.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
It has, however, increased its farm output growth forecast to
1.0 percent from 0.7 percent and industrial output growth to 4.5
percent from 4.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Chinese More Aware of Illness Caused by Air Conditioners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey reveals that
urban residents in China have become more aware of illness caused
by air conditioners as they enjoy the cool created by the
appliances in summer.
</P>
<P>
The survey, carried out among 1,043 air-conditioner users in
five major cities including Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou,
reveals that 88.4 percent of the respondents have heard of
"air-conditioning sickness."
</P>
<P>
Some 473 people, or 45.3 percent of the respondents, believe
"air-conditioning sickness" is really a disease, while 35.9
percent thought otherwise. The remaining 18.8 percent were unsure.
</P>
<P>
Medical specialists at home and abroad have acknowledged the
existence of "air-conditioning sickness," and some experts have
said that closed rooms stop the circulation of fresh air and
easily become a breeding ground for germs.
</P>
<P>
And people can easily catch cold when they suddenly step out
of a cool room into the scorching heat, they add.
</P>
<P>
About 50 percent of those surveyed said the cool produced by
air conditioners usually cause a cold, stuffy nose or dizziness,
reactions similar to those found in medical studies.
</P>
<P>
Experts advise that those using air conditioners not keep it on
around the clock, and not keep the indoor temperature more than
seven degrees lower than outside.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Permit Border Tourists to Visit Central </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has decided to permit
tourists entering through border points to visit the country's
central parts far up to the capital of Yangon to bring about more
tourist arrivals.
</P>
<P>
It was disclosed by Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt, First
Secretary of the Myanmar State Peace and Development Council, at
the Tourism Development Management Committee (TDMC) meeting here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Khin Nyunt, who is also Chairman of TDMC, was quoted by
Wednesday's newspaper The New Light of Myanmar as saying that
tourists entering through these points will also be permitted to
visit attractive destinations such as Mandalay, the second
biggest city, and Bagan, the ancient city rich with cultural
heritage.
</P>
<P>
Despite the " Visit Myanmar Year" campaign launched in 1996,
Myanmar has received fewer tourists in the past two years than
expected.
</P>
<P>
"Because of the internal and external conspiracies to destroy
Myanmar economy, the number of tourists were less than that should
be," Khin Nyunt said.
</P>
<P>
To speed up the development of the country's tourism, Myanmar
has opened six border points with China -- Bhamo, Namkham, Muse,
Kyuhkok, Kunlong and Mongla, and four similar points with Thailand
-- Tachilek, Phaya Thonzu, Myawaddy and Kawthoung.
</P>
<P>
The number of the foreign tourists visiting Myanmar reached
567,458 in 1997-98 fiscal year which ended in March, of which,
302,336 entered through border points.
</P>
<P>
Thailand plays a key role in supplying tourists to Myanmar
among its neighbors and ranks the second after Japan.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in the country's hotels and tourism sector
had reached 1.1 billion U.S. dollars by June this year.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, there are 523 hotels with 14,714 rooms in Myanmar,
whereas there were only 39 hotels with 1,240 rooms before the
country opened its door to the outside world in late 1988.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Leader Praises Enhanced Relation with Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar leader
Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt has praised the enhanced relation
and cooperation between his country and Malaysia brought about
through assistance and encouragement of both governments.
</P>
<P>
Khin Nyunt, first secretary of the Myanmar State Peace and
Development Council, made the appraisal here Tuesday at an
information technology forum, jointly sponsored by the XYBASE
Technologies of Malaysia and the Mastech Co Ltd of Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
He said "Myanmar and Malaysia, as brother members of ASEAN
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations), share many similar
characteristics and these similarities facilitate the
collaboration with each other."
</P>
<P>
"The leaders of the two countries have exchanged visits and
held high level talks with mutually beneficial results," he added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that "at a time when countries of Asia are
trying to defend against the interference of some big powers in
the political and the economic areas through unity and solidarity,
the growing cooperation between Myanmar and Malaysia will benefit
not just our two countries but also the entire region as well."
</P>
<P>
He urged ASEAN and Asian brothers to collectively defend
against the negative Western concepts, outlooks and culture which
are incompatible with the cultural and traditional values of ASEAN
and Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar and Malaysia established diplomatic relation in early
1958. The exchange of visits between their leaders in the recent
two years has significantly contributed to the further development
of their ties and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has brought in Myanmar a capital of 587.17 million
U.S. dollars in 25 projects by the end of March this year,
standing as the fourth largest investor in the country after
Singapore, Britain and Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka To Set Up Rubber Small Holdings Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka will set up the
Rubber Small Holdings Authority before the end of this year to
improve the lot of rubber small holders who are facing hardships
due to depressed prices, according to the Rubber Development
Department here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Legislation for this purpose has been prepared by the
Plantations Ministry and will be presented to the Cabinet soon for

<P>
These societies will take measures to uplift the living
conditions and provide solutions for the depressed markets now
encountered by the small holders.
</P>
<P>
The authority will also start a special pension scheme for
small holders through these societies. The latex produced by small
holders will also be purchased by the societies at a fair price,
the sources said.

led by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE) under a latest peace deal, Italian Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini said on Tuesday.

Milosevic has agreed to an OSCE ground verification of Belgrade's
compliance with the U.N. resolution.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Vietnam Seeks Internal Stability for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
Economic Development
</P>
<P>
(BY Ling Dequan)
</P>
<P>
HANOI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Party of Vietnam
began Tuesday its sixth polonium, phase i, to review the
implementation of the country's socio-economic targets for this
year, and devise orientation and tasks for development for next
year.
</P>
<P>
As 1998 draws to a close, Vietnam's Communist Party and the
government have intensified efforts to meet the set economic
targets, focusing on internal measures to tackle growing obstacles
appearing on the economic horizon.
</P>
<P>
According to most Vietnamese economists, 1999 will be a tough
year in comparison to 1998.
</P>
<P>
The financial and monetary crisis has now spread over the
entire region, affecting small and established economies alike.
</P>
<P>
Several Vietnamese economists have predicted the fallout from
the crisis will impact heavily on the macro-economies of every
country in the Asia region with devastating consequences.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam acknowledges that its economy is still developing and,
therefore, is constrained by internal and external factors.
</P>
<P>
Economists warned that it is necessary for the government to
assess the situation and balance national development strategies
in order to channel available resources in the search for economic
stability.
</P>
<P>
Policy makers admitted that Vietnam cannot achieve the set
economic targets, even though most targets were lowered in July.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam Investment Review reported in its latest issue
that Vietnam could still achieve GDP growth of 6-7 percent for the
year, though down from the 9 percent growth target set at the
beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
In the same token, industrial growth could increase 10-11
percent (down from 13 percent forecast at the beginning of the
year), agricultural output could increase 3-3.5 percent (down from
4.6-4.8 percent), export growth could increase ten percent (down
from 25-26 percent), while year-on-year inflation may be less than
ten percent, not the seven percent as anticipated.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party and the government must now face the truth
and acknowledge that economic targets will not be achieved this
year. Alternative approaches to maintain economic stability have
now been raised and need serious executive consideration.
</P>
<P>
Taking into consideration the regional crisis which has
devastated the economies of many countries, several economists
argued that Vietnam's achievements should not be ignored and, in
some ways, can be viewed as a success.
</P>
<P>
Others argued, while it is true the country has suffered from
external factors largely outside Vietnam's control, the government
has dragged its heels in regard to economic reform and must
accelerate the process.
</P>
<P>
"Vietnam should not view 1998 as a year of doom-and-gloom,
rather a year of mixed results", the English-language weekly
quoted leading economists and observers as saying.
</P>
<P>
Though most economists agreed Vietnam has made an enormous
progress, especially in maintaining political and social
stability, further steps must be taken to ensure Vietnam continues
along the path of integration with the world economy.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believed that major measures and adjustment for
the following years will be decided at the on-going sixth polonium
(phase 1) of the Communist Party of Vietnam.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, October 13 (Xinhua) -- A four-day-old Argentinian
baby has undergone a successful heart transplant in the first
successful operation of its kink in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
The operation at the Children's Hospital of La Plata, Buenos
Aires, lasted 10 hours and was completed at 5:00 a.m. on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Juan Jose Mussi, the health minister of Buenos Aires, said the
baby was recovering in a stable condition.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first surgery of its kind in Latin America due to
the young age of both the donor and recipient," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hospital director Herminia Itarte said that the child was born
with ventricular hypoplasia and atresia, requiring an urgent heart
transplant.
</P>
<P>
The donor organ was taken from a 16-day-old baby who died of a
cerebral malformation. After the child's cause of death was
established the parents agreed to allow the heart to be used in a
transplant.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang's Urban Residents Have More Living Space </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The living conditions of urban
residents in east China's Zhejiang Province have improved
considerably over the past two decades, with per capita living
space doubled during the period.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang's urban residents now have an average of 11.28 square
meters of living space per person, up from 5.5 square meters in
1978 when China launched the economic reform and
opening-up drive, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang's housing construction sector has also developed
steadily in the last two decades. During the national Eighth
Five-Year Plan period (1991- 1995) alone, more than 25 million
square meters of run-down and unsafe houses were demolished, and
some 620,000 residents moved into new buildings.
</P>
<P>
In the provincial capital of Hangzhou, housing with a combined
floor space of 1.86 million square meters were constructed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
While more commercial housing has been built in recent years,
Zhejiang has also stepped up efforts to build more economic
residences to cater to the needs of low-income families. More than
30,000 low-income families moved into new housing last year alone.
</P>
<P>
A provincial official said that Zhejiang will continue to take
measures to improve the living conditions of the urban residents.
</P>
<P>
Urban residents will have an average 12 square meters of living
space per person by the year 2000, according to the official.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Benefit From Technical Training Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Though still a farmer, Huang
Yongjiang has become an agro-technician in the eyes of his fellow
villagers in Xinchang County in east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Huang plants strawberries, grapes and honey peaches on some
three hectares of land, raises fish, and earns over 100,000 yuan a
year, a dozen times more than the average income of his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
What's more, he has implemented a research project on the
cultivation of strawberries in the county and spread the
techniques to local farmers.
</P>
<P>
Huang attributes his progress mostly to the technical training
he received in Japan in 1993.
</P>
<P>
"The experience not only allowed me access to some new
techniques, but also opened up my view," the 30-year-old farmer
said.
</P>
<P>
Like Huang, more and more Chinese farmers have in recent years
gone to foreign countries such as Japan, Singapore and Thailand on
their own for technical training in areas including agriculture,
machinery, electronics and clothing manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to know how many farmers have gone abroad for
this purpose, but the number is on the rise," said Ye Zhengming,
director of the China Association for Promotion of Applied
Technology Exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Most of the farmers going abroad come from coastal areas such
as Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Fujian and Guangdong provinces, whose fast-
growing rural economies have prompted local farmers to improve
themselves, Ye said.
</P>
<P>
In Shaoxing County in Zhejiang, one of China's most developed
areas, township and village enterprises have been mushrooming and
some 30 farmers have gone to large companies in Japan for
technical training during the past five years. Twenty-seven have
returned to work in rural enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Jinliang is one example. After two years of technical training
in an auto factory in Japan, he came back to set up a silk-thread
plant which targets Europe as its market. This year, he became
deputy general manager of the Jishan Group, an enterprise group
estimated to have 100 million yuan in assets.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the overseas-trained farmers are now the backbone of
the managerial and technical class of the rural enterprises in
which they work," said Chen Zhiwei, director of the Shaoxing
Science and Technology Association.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of township and village enterprises in
coastal areas are now eyeing overseas technical training as an
effective way to improve the quality of their employees, and they
plan to send more of them abroad, Chen said.

<P>
BUDAPEST, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization's request for permission to use Hungary's territorial
air space to coordinate air strikes against Yugoslavia is meeting
with varied responses in the country.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, NATO, in its preparations for attacks against
Yugoslavia, asked for Hungary's permission to use its air space to
conduct military strikes against Yugoslavia. The request caused a
stir in Hungary.
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian government decided to grant NATO's request on
Tuesday and suggested the National Assembly endorse it at the
delayed special meeting on Wednesday. Related commissions under
the assembly are consulting intensively over the request.
</P>
<P>
Political parties, including the Hungarian Workers' Party,
strongly opposed their country's involvement in a war based on
interference from others' in internal affairs. They argue that
such adventurous actions could bring a lasting negative impact to
Hungary.
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian Democratic Forum in the ruling coalition Tuesday
also expressed opposition to NATO's request.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, ethnic Hungarians living in the autonomous region
of Vojvodina, Yugoslavia, dispatched representatives to meet the
Hungarian Political State Secretary in a southern city of Szeged.
</P>
<P>
They urged Hungary to proceed from the interests of ethnic
Hungarians abroad and reject NATO's request.
</P>
<P>
Amid the disagreeing voices, the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign
Affairs Tuesday reiterated its "extreme hope" for a peaceful
settlement to the Kosovo crisis.

SHENYANG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Shenyang, a heavy industrial
city in northeast China's Liaoning Province, has been trying hard
to become one of the country's best tourist destinations and turn
tourism into an important source of income.
</P>
<P>
Over the past years, Shenyang, also the provincial capital of

And now, tourists to Shenyang will find it has become an easier
place to tour with the completion of the second ring road, built
at cost of 1.5 billion yuan, renovation of an urban canal, 21
refurbished cultural squares, and six new shopping streets.
</P>
<P>
The city is also home to 100 important cultural sites and
many places associated with well-known people. It also has plenty
of picturesque natural scenery.
</P>
<P>
Efforts in afforestation have brought Shenyang's forest cover
to 30.67 percent, much higher than the national average. Shenyang
also has been chosen by the United Nations as an experimental
center for sustainable urban development.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the city had 13.46 million tourist arrivals,

<HEADLINE> Lack of Money Delays Trial of Murderer Suspect in Ukraine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, October 13 (Xinhua) -- A Ukrainian local court was unable
to open the case of a suspect charged of murdering 52 people
because of lack of money, the Kievskye Vedomosti newspaper
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Although the local court in Zhitomir Oblast has 103 volumes of
files on the crimes of Anatolii Onuprienko, who was arrested on
charge of murder, robbery, stealing and rape, but has no money to
begin the trial.
</P>
<P>
About 143,000 gryvnas (over 41,000 U.S. dollars) are needed to
deal with the case, including travel expenses to bring over 300
witnesses and about 100 victims to appear in court. But the

<HEADLINE> One Million US Dollar Note Seized in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 14 (Xinhua) -- An one million U.S. dollar
currency note was seized Tuesday by the Sri Lankan police,
according to the official newspaper Daily News Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The one million U.S. dollar note was seized in an under cover
operation by the Terrorist Investigation Division (TID) officers
posing as businessmen, police sources told the paper.
</P>
<P>
Following a tip-off TID detectives had contacted a Muslim
businessman, a broker who wanted to negotiate the sale of the one
million dollar note for 60 million rupees at a hotel in Colombo.
</P>
<P>
From there, they were taken to a private house in the city
where they were introduced to the Muslim businessman's father and
a young Tamil who produced the note.
</P>
<P>
At this point, the detectives pounced on the suspect, recovered
the note and arrested all three suspects.
</P>
<P>
Investigations reveal that the Tamil suspect had paid several
visits to India and if he failed to sell the note in Sri Lanka he
intended to travel to Singapore to sell it, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources believed that the money was to be used to finance
Sri Lanka's rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
A similar note for one million U.S. dollars was recovered by
police last week from a woman at Chilaw, North of Colombo, who was
married to an Indian and had spent the past eight years there,
said the sources, adding that Police are investigating whether
there was a connection between the two holders of the currency
notes.

<HEADLINE> France to Participate in OSCE Mission to Kosovo </HEADLINE>

<P>
PARIS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- France will participate in an
observation mission of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to Serbia's secessionist province of
Kosovo, French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign and Defense ministries are working on conditions to
take part in the OSCE mission aiming to verify on the ground
Belgrade's compliance with the United Nations resolution, Vedrine
told parliament.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement secured by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic earlier Tuesday, the
OSCE is to send a 2,000-strong mission to Kosovo to ensure the
implementation of the peace accord there.
</P>
<P>
The deal was hammered out amid threats of imminent military
intervention from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
which issued a 96-hour ultimatum to Milosevic to comply with the
U.N. resolution or face air strikes.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine described the deal as "very important" but urged that
"the details of this agreement must now be filled out" and that
the U.N. Security Council should approve the deal.
</P>
<P>
He said NATO should also organize verification in the air
besides the one on the ground and urged NATO and Belgrade to reach
such an agreement.
</P>
<P>
He asked Milosevic to make a unilateral statement affirming his
commitment to a political settlement of the Kosovo conflicts
through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The French foreign minister also called for an early meeting of
the six-nation Contact Group on former Yugoslavia, which comprises
Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Peru Takes More Lines of Foreign Credit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian banks received more
foreign credit from various sources this year despite the
international financial crisis, President German Suarez of the
Central Reserves Bank said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The new lines of credit, being negotiated with foreign
financial institutions, could amount to more than 1 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to Suarez, the country's foreign debt has grown 26
percent between January and September in 1998.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, the amount of the debt was about 3 billion
dollars. It increased to 3.800 billion dollars in July, Suarez
said.
</P>
<P>
Many of the country's companies are experiencing difficulties
in production and in meeting their bank payments because of a lack
of liquidity.
</P>
<P>
Financial authorities say the government is negotiating new
lines of foreign credit to help solve the liquidity problem faced
by the business sector.

<HEADLINE> New Body Set up to Protect Women From Violence in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
formed a Commission on Violence Against Women to curb violence
against women, national newspapers reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A presidential decree setting up the 21-member commission was
signed by President B.J. Habibie on October 9.
</P>
<P>
Members of the commission include noted psychologist Saparinah
Sadli and businesswomen Herawati Diah.
</P>
<P>
Saparinah told reporters that the commission is in accordance
with the government's 1984 ratification of an UN declaration on
violence against women.
</P>
<P>
The commission's mission was to remind the government to
continue efforts aimed at "a conducive situation" for the
realization of human rights, particularly when women were
concerned, she added.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that members of the commission voiced doubt
that last Friday's slaying of rape counselor Martadinata, better
known as Ita, was a "criminally motivated murder".
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old victim was found with her neck slashed and stab
wounds on her hands, abdomen and chest at her Central Jakarta
House on Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
Saparinah said Ita's death was a result of ongoing threats
against women investigating rapes that occurred during the May
riots. The murder and accompanying misinformation was allegedly
carried out by "government-backed perpetrators".
</P>
<P>
The country saw the worst looting and rioting in decades in
Jakarta and other cities from May 13 to 15. About 1,200 lives were
claimed, and thousands of buildings and vehicles were damaged and
burnt. Activists have reported that 168 women were gang-raped or
otherwise sexually assaulted during the riots and 20 of them died
or committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
"The terrorism against the activists would be difficult to
prove, but what happened to Ita clearly proves that threats were
inflicted on the group," Saparinah said.
</P>
<P>
She also criticized government officials for doubting reports
that dozens of ethnic Chinese women were raped and sexually
assaulted.
</P>
<P>
"The president has strongly condemned the rapes and assaults as
barbaric acts... so these officials should follow what has
previously been said. They should admit massive cases of rapes did
occur during the riots," she added.
</P>
<P>
National Police Chief Lt. Gen. Roesmanhadi said in August that
some non-governmental organizations were exaggerating reports of
rapes and sexual assaults against Chinese-Indonesian women during
the riots.
</P>
<P>
The Armed Forces (ABRI) Commander Gen. Wiranto has also
repeatedly said that ABRI had found no evidence to substantiate
the claims.

<HEADLINE> Italian President Asks Prodi to Seek Backing for New Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Italian President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro on Tuesday asked caretaker Prime Minister Romano Prodi to
examine the possibility of forming a new coalition coalition, four
days after Prodi resigned amid a confidence crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a "partial mandate" to Prodi, the president charged him to
"examine the existence of parliamentary support which would permit
the formation of a new government".
</P>
<P>
He asked Prodi to report his findings as soon as possible to
provide the basis for a full mandate and put an early end to the
government crisis over the controversial 1999 budget bill.
</P>
<P>
Scalfaro said he decided to give the partial mandate to Prodi
following suggestions by several party leaders during political
consultations in the last few days.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said after accepting the mandate that he would "get down
to work immediately" in order to report the result to the
president as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The center-left government led by Prodi's Olive Tree Party
resigned last Friday after losing a confidence vote in the lower
house by just one vote.
</P>
<P>
The confidence vote was called because the Communist
Refoundation Party, which had supported Prodi since the 1996
election, decided to withdraw its crucial backing from the
government's draft 1999 budget announced on September 25.

<HEADLINE> Quebec Premier Calls on Election in Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard
said Tuesday that the French-speaking province of Canada will hold
a general election this fall.
</P>
<P>
Bouchard made the announcement Tuesday while touring the Lower
St. Lawrence region, reports said.
</P>
<P>
"When you've been in power for more than four years, you find
yourself up against the wall and you come across as a condemned
government," he said.
</P>
<P>
The election, which he must call before September 1999, "will
be in the fall," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
But Bouchard stopped short of saying what date the election
will be held. November 23 or November 30 is considered by many as
the likeliest date.
</P>
<P>
Recent poll shows that Quebec could have a very tight election
race if a general election was called this fall.
</P>
<P>
Quebec's main opposition Liberal Party leads the ruling Parti
Quebecois by about four percentage points, but there remains a
high level of satisfaction with the Parti Quebecois government,
the poll said.
</P>
<P>
That situation could favor Parti Quebecois. The support for
the Liberals is concentrated on a few areas, such as Montreal,
where the number of seats up for grabs is limited.
</P>
<P>
In the election four years ago, Parti Quebecois defeated the
Liberals by nearly 30 seats in the fight for the 125-seat
provincial legislature. Less than one percentage point divided
the two parties in popular support.
</P>
<P>
If the ruling party wins the upcoming election, another
referendum on Quebec's separation from Canada could be held if
Bouchard deems it winnable, reports said.

<HEADLINE> Hunan Launches Projects to Prevent Soil Erosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Hunan Province in central
China will spend more than 2.5 billion yuan (about three million
U.S. dollars) to launch the largest soil erosion control project
since 1949 in the wake of this summer's devastating floods.
</P>
<P>
About 44,000 square kilometers of the province's land area are
suffering from soil erosion due to the deterioration of the
ecological surroundings along the province's four rivers: the
Xiangjiang, Zijiang, Yuanshui, and Lishui, out of which more than
30 million tons of sand flow annually into Dongting Lake.
</P>
<P>
As fundamental steps to deal with the problem, the provincial
government decided to undertake large-scale soil and water
resources protection projects and the improvement of ecological
surroundings.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, the province will expand its forest
coverage rate to 55 percent in five years, and will launch a group
of projects including forest protection, afforestation and the
restoration of grasslands.
</P>
<P>
Logging will be prohibited on about 78,000 hectares of the
province's forests, and passes to three million hectares of
forests in river and lake valleys and reservoirs will be sealed
off for cultivation at the beginning of next year.
</P>
<P>
About 40,000 hectares of farmland will be restored to forests
each year, and the province plans to spend 40 million yuan (about
five million U.S. dollars) on cultivating 20,000 hectares of
anti-flood forests and 330,000 hectares of grasslands.

<P>
YANGON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment in Myanmar
reached 7.064 billion U.S. dollars at the end of March this year,
according to a latest official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The investment, that came from 23 countries and regions, covers
303 projects.
</P>
<P>
Of the projects, those in oil and gas sector drew the largest
amount of investment, reaching 2.303 billion dollars, followed by
manufacturing, hotels and tourism, real estate and mining.
</P>
<P>
The statistics also show that Singapore ranked the first among
foreign investors, injecting into the country 1.485 billion
dollars, followed by Britain, Thailand, Malaysia and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Since Myanmar adopted an open-door market-oriented economic
policy in late 1988, investment environment gradually improved
with foreign investors stepping in.
</P>
<P>
However, due to the impact of the Asian financial crisis,
Myanmar received only 1.3 billion dollars of foreign investment in
1997, one billion dollars less than that in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The country drew 222 million dollars of foreign investment in
the first six months of this year.

<P>
WARSAW, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Slovenian President
Milan Kucan said here Tuesday that the Holbrooke-Milosevic
agreement should be carefully and cautiously evaluated.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued after he met Polish President
Aleksander Kwasniewski, the Slovenian president said it still
remains a question whether the Yugoslav president has agreed to
the autonomy of the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and the access of
OSCE (Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe)
observers to the area.
</P>
<P>
Whether Milosevic's compromise was made just to avoid a NATO
military intervention also remains a question, he added.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the Kosovo issue should be permanently
settled and the conditions set by the Contact Group should be met.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement negotiated between U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, the OSCE will
deploy 2,000 observers to verify compliance with UN demands that
include an immediate ceasefire, a withdrawal of Serb forces from
Kosovo, a return of refugees, and autonomy talks with ethnic
Albanians.

SHANGHAI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Although there are only six
members in the Russian delegation -- a team leader, a coach and
four girl athletes -- they have high hopes for gold medals at the
International Schoolsports Federation (ISF) World Gymnasiade s

<P>
All the four girls will take part in the rhythmic gymnastics
competitions. Team leader Turcisbekova said the group was

It is the first time the girls have participated in an

The delegation came here earlier after a three-day journey in

</P>
<P>
The first thing they asked for on their arrival was to have a
training hall. As there is no gymnasium near their hotel, their
demand could not be satisfied at once.
</P>
<P>
But the girls practiced their first-day training on the hotel
corridor's carpet instead. Their embarrassment was short-lived
as, the next morning, a more appropriate training ground was
found.

three members are from the same family. Sinevesc Marina, the
coach, is also the mother of 8-year-old Turusbekova Veronika, the
youngest athlete in the team, while the team leader is her aunt.
</P>
<P>
"Our whole family loves gymnastics," Irina said. Veronika is
only a second grader but she has been training in gymnastics for
four years and has won a prize at a competition held in Northeast
China.
</P>
<P>
Veronika can only show her performances but will be unable to w
in a medal since she is too young to qualify for the
competition.

<HEADLINE> China Unemployment Situation Worsening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China is facing severe
unemployment and must rely on labor-intensive projects to
alleviate the situation, according to the China Economic Times.
</P>
<P>
China has an unemployed population of between 13-15 million
people and the unemployment rate is eight percent this year. These
figures could climb to 15-18 million, and around nine percent in
1999, the newspaper quoted Dr. Hu Angang of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences as saying.
</P>
<P>
"As the average household has 3.3 persons, as many as 50
million people are affected by unemployment," said Dr. Hu at a
recent economic seminar.
</P>
<P>
The calculation does not include those rural migrants who are
unemployed in the cities. The number of rural surplus laborers was
estimated at 160 million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"We can clearly say that China has entered the high
unemployment phase," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, China now supports 26.3 percent of the
world's population with less than four percent of the world's
capital resources.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Hu explained that China saw a sudden outbreak of
unemployment in 1993, when China redoubled its efforts to transfer
from a planned economy to the socialist market economy and
restructure its economy.
</P>
<P>
The old industrial base such as northeast China, whose heavy
industry developed with Soviet aid in the 1950s, and traditional
sectors like transportation and the textile industry, saw the
highest rate of lay-offs.
</P>
<P>
The economist said that China should use its rich labor
resources to the full and put more emphasis on developing
labor-intensive projects to solve the unemployment problem.
</P>
<P>
He said that the development of the private sector will also
help absorb laid-off workers from state-owned enterprises, and
stressed the building of a social security system to ensure a
stable society.

<HEADLINE> Albania Welcomes Political Efforts for Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian government warned
on Tuesday that the international community must keep up the
pressure on Yugoslavia to guarantee a peaceful settlement of the
Kosovo conflict, the Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Commitments by the United States, NATO (North Atlantic Treaty
Organization) and other international organizations have proved to
be effective, said ministry spokesman Sokol Gjoka.
</P>
<P>
"Taking into consideration that the Belgrade government has not
kept its promises so far, we think it is necessary to exert a
constant political and military pressure on it until resolution
1199 of the UN Security Council is implemented," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We support all the steps taken by the international community
to provide a durable and long-term solution of the Kosovo crisis,
which respects the will of the Kosovo Albanians and international
principles, and which also serves security and stability in the
Balkans," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Gjoka said he hoped that Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic would not break his promises after an agreement
early Tuesday with U.S. Special Envoy Richard Holbrooke to
withdraw troops from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He also urged NATO to carry out its threat of air strikes
against Serbian strategic positions if Serb security forces failed
to withdraw from Kosovo within the 96-hour time limit set by the
alliance.

<HEADLINE> More Than Half of Indonesia's State Firms Unhealthy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- More than half of Indonesia's
159 state-owned companies have been categorized as unhealthy, and
more than half of their assets are deemed non-performing, the
Indonesian Observer Wednesday quoted a minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Approximately 54 percent of the 159 state firms are unhealthy,
and based on 1997 calculations, state firms could only book a
profit of only 2.61 percent," State Enterprises Minister Tanri
Abeng told a meeting of parliamentarians here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Abeng said assets of the state companies totaled 461 trillion
rupiah (46.1 billion U.S. dollars) with more than half being
deposited with state banks or state-owned banks.
</P>
<P>
Half of the assets are not non-productive, bring the value of
performing assets managed by the Ministry, excluding state oil
firm Pertamina, to 250 trillion rupiah.
</P>
<P>
"That's the amount of assets managed by the state minister for
the empowerment of state enterprises," Abeng said.
</P>
<P>
These are the conditions that make state firms' competitiveness
very low compared to private companies, the minister said.

<HEADLINE> Retired U.S. Officer Charged With Spying for Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 13 (Xinhua) -- A retired U.S. Army
intelligence analyst was charged on Tuesday with spying for
selling Russia top-secret documents and could face a life or death
sentence.
</P>
<P>
David Sheldon Boone, 46, a sergeant who used to analyze
intercepted communications at the Pentagon's super-secret National
Security Agency, was arrested at a hotel near Washington on
Saturday after flying to the United States from Munich, Germany.
</P>
<P>
Boone, who appeared Tuesday before U.S. Magistrate Judge Welton
C. Sewell in Alexandria, Virginia, was charged with espionage,
which carries a maximum penalty of life in prison, or death if
certain conditions are met.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) officials said Boone,
who retired in 1991 after working on secret codes, thought he was
meeting with a Russian agent about resuming his alleged espionage
activities, but in reality he was meeting with an undercover FBI
agent.
</P>
<P>
Boone told the FBI's fake Russian spy that, during 1988-1991 in
Germany, he sold the Soviets details of U.S. targets for tactical
nuclear weapons in case of a Soviet nuclear attack and a 300-to
400-page handbook listing reconnaissance and intelligence
collection systems used by the U.S. military, according to an FBI
affidavit.
</P>
<P>
Boone also told the fake Russian agent he had volunteered to
spy for the Soviet Union in 1988 when his marriage was breaking up
and he was so short of cash he used the Soviet payments for
ordinary living expenses while serving in the Army in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Boone expressed a willingness to move back to the United States
for a full-time position with the Russians and said he could set
up a business at home as a cover for his activities.
</P>
<P>
According to the criminal complaint, Boone began spying in 1988
after he walked into the Soviet embassy in Washington and
volunteered his services.
</P>
<P>
Boone was driven out of the embassy in a closed van, was
dropped off several blocks away and given a wig and moustache to
use as a disguise for the next meeting, he told the undercover FBI
agent.
</P>
<P>
In all, Boone said he was paid more than 60,000 U.S. dollars
for the highly sensitive top-secret documents he gave the Russian
agents from 1988 to 1991, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
After the initial meeting in the U.S. embassy, Boone allegedly
made arrangements to continue spying when he was reassigned in
1988 to Augsburg, Germany, where the U.S. Army had a field station.
</P>
<P>
After going to Augsburg, Boone had his first meeting with a
Russian agent identified as "Igor," who gave him a secret
communications plan that included emergency meeting and signal
sites.
</P>
<P>
Boone met with the Russian agent four times a year at various
locations along the Rhine River, allegedly giving him documents
about the capabilities and movements of Soviet forces and about
Soviet tactical nuclear weapons.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Seven people were arrested and
a ship was under police escort early Wednesday morning after what
Australian police calls the largest ever heroin seizure in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Up to 400 kilograms of heroin worth up to 240 million U.S.
dollars was seized after the drug was transferred from a ship to a
smaller vessel on the New South Wales state's mid-north coast,
southeast Australia, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) said.
</P>
<P>
An AFP spokeswoman said the heroin seizure was believed to be
the largest ever in Australia.
</P>
<P>
She said there was no information about the nationalities of
the seven people arrested.
</P>
<P>
Australian Federal Customs Minister Warren Truss told reporters
the seizure was the biggest in Australian history.
</P>
<P>
"We have seizures almost every second day but a major seizure
of this order, the biggest in our history, is a demonstration that
our techniques are working effectively."
</P>
<P>
"Taking this amount of heroin out of the Australian market will
obviously have a significant impact. It is several hundred million
dollars worth of heroin so that obviously make a significant dent
in the trade," said the minister.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, Philippines Presidents Agree to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia and the Philippines
Tuesday night agreed to use their respective currencies in an
effort to enhance bilateral trade and to materialize the plan on
an ASEAN single currency, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas
said.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesian President B.J. Habibie and Philippine President
Joseph Estrada agreed to use the two countries' currencies in an
effort to step up bilateral economic relations," Alatas was quoted
by Antara News Agency Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Alatas was speaking to reporters following a one-on-one meeting
between Habibie and Estrada at the Melia Panorama Hotel on
Indonesia's Batam Island near Singapore.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesia and the Philippines are exploring the
possibility of making regulations on the financial sector as the
Philippines made such an agreement with Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asian countries wish to use an ASEAN single currency
like the European countries had done, Alatas said in the company
of his Philippine counterpart Domingo Siazon.
</P>
<P>
Alatas pointed out that the two presidents also agreed that the
ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) should be implemented earlier, namely
in 2001 instead of 2003.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Habibie would attend the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation Forum (APEC) to take place in Malaysia in November,
Alatas reiterated that no decision has yet been taken about it.
</P>
<P>
"The reason is not the current situation in Malaysia, but that
Indonesia has no vice president yet. Even if President Habibie
attends the APEC meeting, he may leave in the morning and return
home in the afternoon," he said.
</P>
<P>
Siazon told reporters that Estrada would attend the meeting as
APEC is important for the Philippines and for ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia is the host so we have committed to be present,"
Siazon added.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion, Alatas told reporters that Habibie and Estrada
also expressed concern over the situation in Malaysia and
expressed the sincere hope that this present situation can be
quickly overcome by the Malaysian government.
</P>
<P>
"We do not interfere other sovereign countries. We do not tell
each other what to do with regard to internal developments,"
Alatas added.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time for them to meet personally as new
presidents of their respective countries. Estrada took office on
June 30 while Habibie was sworn in on May 21 after his predecessor
Soeharto was forced down amid the country's worst economic and
political crisis in decades.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scientists Develop New Lock on Network Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, October 13 (Xinhua) -- A team of U.S. scientists
have developed a minuscule mechanical device they describe as "the
world's smallest combination lock," promising to build a virtually
impenetrable computer firewall.
</P>
<P>
Sandia National Laboratories said in a news release Monday that
the Recodable Locking Device is a series of tiny notched gears
that move to the unlocked position only when the right code is
entered.
</P>
<P>
Using the microelectromechanical system (MEMS) so small that it
takes a microscope to see it, Sadia said, the device is the first
known mechanical hardware designed to keep unwanted guests from
breaking codes and illegally entering computer and other secure
systems.
</P>
<P>
Sandia, a U.S. Department of Energy security lab in
Albuquerque, New Mexico, fabricated the device in July, and
expects to commercialize it within two years.
</P>
<P>
Firewalls are typically software programs located on a server
that are designed to keep unauthorized users from accessing a
computer network. Software is subject to manipulations.
</P>
<P>
The Recodable Locking Device is hardware. With it in place, a
user would only have one opportunity to enter the correct password

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Government Has no Plan on Repatriation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
no immediate plans to force exporters to repatriate their
earnings, Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and Industry
Ginandjar Kartasasmita said.
</P>
<P>
"They (exporters) can save it in any currency they want to, and
they will be free to do with it what they want," Ginandjar told
reporters prior to a meeting between President B.J. Habibie and
his Philippine counterpart Joseph Estrada in Batam near Singapore
on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Ginandjar said the government is still considering the
imposition of currency flow monitoring system, and that the
repatriation is not included in the system.
</P>
<P>
"It is certain that there is a need for the currency flow
monitoring system. So we are still studying it," he was quoted by
the Indonesian Observer Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bank Indonesia Governor Sjahril Sabirin Tuesday told
reporters here that the capital-flow monitoring mechanism being
prepared by the monetary authorities will not force exporters to
surrender their hard currency earnings to the central bank.
</P>
<P>
"Repatriation of export earnings is not included in the draft.
Our attention focuses on better ways of monitoring foreign
exchange traffic," Sjahril said.
</P>
<P>
He explained the forex monitoring plan would only be an
additional measure to the requirement imposed in March on the
estimated 2,000 private sector debtors to report their foreign
borrowings to the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Sjahril expected the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank would back the central bank's plan because it would only
involve monitoring of capital flow.

<HEADLINE> NATO Promises Hungary Security for Coordination Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) said it would provide Hungary with security
guarantees in return for helping to coordinate possible air
strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The guarantees were offered following Hungarian concerns that
they could suffer retaliation from Yugoslavia's military if they
agreed to NATO's request to assist in coordinating air raids
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday NATO made a formal request for approval to use
Hungary's territorial air space for possible attacks against
Yugoslavia, which aroused concerns among Hungarians.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a Serbian official said neighboring countries would be
deemed aggressors if it collaborated in whatever form with NATO's
air strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian paper, Nepszabadsaq (People's Freedom), said
Tuesday that it learned from the Chairman of the Committee for
Home Defense in the National Assembly Lanyi Zsolt that NATO had
agreed to provide Hungary with an "air security umbrella" and
would deploy fighter jets in the country in the event the use of
its air space incurred military threats from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
NATO's liaison group has reportedly arrived in Budapest to
advise Hungary on coordination plans with the military bloc's
activity.

<HEADLINE> China to Destroy Dikes in Largest Lake for Flood Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China will destroy hundreds of
dikes to increase the flood-water storage capacity of its largest
lake by nearly 25 percent in about three years in an effort to more
effectively control flooding.
</P>
<P>
"The flood water storage area of Poyang Lake will be increased
by 1,137 square kilometers in about three years, and this
increased area is about the same size of the lake lost to land
reclamation over the past four decades," according to an official
of east Jiangxi Province where the lake is located.
</P>
<P>
Poyang Lake, on the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, plays
an important role in diverting flood water from the river. The
lake area reached 5,100 square kilometers in the early 1950s, with
a storage capacity of 37 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
However, land reclamation efforts in the past four decades have
reduced the lake area to 3,900 square kilometers and the storage
capacity to 29.8 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
To raise the lake's water storage capacity, all non-essential
dikes in the lake area with a height below 22 meters will be
leveled or destroyed, said Liu Zhengmin, head of the Jiangxi
Provincial Headquarters for Flood Control and Drought Relief.
</P>
<P>
By this standard, a total of 234 dikes will be destroyed,
increasing the lake's flood-water storage capacity by 5.92 billion
cubic meters, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
"The past efforts to reclaim land from the lake and build
houses or barriers on the lake have substantially reduced the
lake's capacity to divert and store flood water, and significantly
increased the difficulties of flood control," Liu noted.
</P>
<P>
"The severe flooding this year has taught us a profound
lesson," he added.
</P>
<P>
The months-long flooding of the Yangtze River which began in
mid-June, the worst since 1954, has been partly blamed on
irrational logging of trees in the upper reaches and on land
reclamation. The flooding resulted in grave losses of life and
property.
</P>
<P>
"The flooding has made us deeply realize the importance of
utilizing natural resources reasonably," Liu said. "Even though we
can reap tons of grain from the reclaimed land, our gains are
outweighed by losses when compared with the manpower and materials
used to fight against the floods."
</P>
<P>
Liu's views are widely shared by local officials and residents,
as evidenced by the popular support for the government plan to
destroy dikes and increase the lake area. Implementation of the
plan, which has been sanctioned by the central authorities,
requires the relocation of 468,000 farmers to areas at higher
elevations.
</P>
<P>
Preparations for construction of accommodations for the
resettlement of farmers are proceeding smoothly, according to
Liu.

<HEADLINE> 7th East Asia Economic Summit Put Forth Action Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The Seventh East Asia
Economic Summit Tuesday put forth the Action Plan for Global
Growth and Reform of the World Financial System
</P>
<P>
The plan says participants of the 1998 East Asia Economic
Summit of the World Economic Forum are deeply concerned about the
drift of the world economy and financial markets as well as the
growing risk of global recession, and they believe a string of
strong and bold actions must be taken immediately.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, developed countries, namely the United States,
Canada, European countries and Japan are urged to bolster their
economies and the world economy against the rising threat of
global recession, immediately expand the provision of official
loans and credit guarantees to the emerging markets in crisis,
especially to cover basic necessities in foodstuffs, energy and
medical and pharmaceutical supplies, and to reconfirm their
commitment to open trade in goods and services.
</P>
<P>
Developed countries are warned to abstain from allowing an
arbitrary use of "safeguards" such as anti-dumping measures or
countervailing duties to become protectionist policies in
disguise.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Japan has a GNP twice as large as all of the rest
of Asia combined, it says Japan has a special responsibility to
help the region emerge from its current deep recession.
</P>
<P>
Japan is urged to undertake strong and further measures to
further expand its money supply, to recapitalize its financial
sector, to ensure speedy recovery of the banking sector and adopt
a dynamic, growth promoting fiscal policy with emphasis on
expanding domestic consumption, and to implement the
lately-announced plan of 30 billion U.S. dollars in Japanese
assistance to the crisis countries of East Asia.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Canada and European countries are urged to
adopt significant cuts in interest rates, to facilitate
restructuring by supporting realistic settlements on the foreign
debt owed by Asian corporations to international creditors.
</P>
<P>
Governments in the crisis countries are urged to remain
committed to maintaining open markets for goods and services as
well as foreign investment, to continuing the effort towards
greater transparency and to the strengthening of the institutional
infrastructure to support open market, to accelerate the
recapitalization of the financial and banking sectors, to
facilitate the rapid restructuring of corporate debt in a
pragmatic manner, and to review the prudent limits on short term
capital inflows, including limits on short-term foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
Regarding a reform of the world financial system, the plan says
that G-7 economies should undertake to establish a new regulatory
regime for the monitoring, disclosure, and regulation of highly
leveraged short-term flows, as well as off-balance-sheet
commitments and derivative transactions.
</P>
<P>
It stresses the need for a comprehensive reconsideration by the
membership of the IMF and the World Bank of the mandate,
structures, functions and resources of these institutions.
</P>
<P>
It also says the participants endorse proposals for an
emergency" Global Growth Summit" and stress strongly that the
emerging market economies should be equally represented along with
the advanced economies at such summit.
</P>
<P>
It says at the end that these measures would constitute a
critical step towards a renewal of world growth, which is now the
critical condition to stabilizing emerging economies and world
markets.
</P>
<P>
They would also set the basis for the establishment of a new
global financial architecture, it adds.

<HEADLINE> NBA Cancels First Two Weeks of Season as Labor Talks Stall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The NBA canceled games for
the first time in its 52-year history today, wiping out the
season's first two weeks after collective bargaining with the
Players Association again bogged down.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a very pleasant announcement," NBA commissioner
David Stern said from a Manhattan hotel. "The realities are I
think the owners had no choice."
</P>
<P>
"Lousy, disappointed. My job is to put on games for the fans,
not to cancel them. It's terribly disappointing," Stern added.
</P>
<P>
However, both sides expressed optimism about a luxury tax
proposed by the union that Stern said the owners would respond to
by Friday.
</P>
<P>
Players Association executive director Billy Hunter said the
proposal also included the reinstitution of restricted free
agency and a policy on marijuana but would retain the Larry Bird
Exception, which all teams to exceed the salary cap to sign their
own free agents.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously we're concerned the league has elected to cancel
games, but we're buoyed by their agreeability," Hunter said.
"There has been some progress."
</P>
<P>
A total of 99 games were scheduled over the first 14 days of
the season, which was to begin November 3. The entire preseason
schedule was canceled last week, when the union and league met
for the first time in two months.
</P>
<P>
"It's evident we're not going to reach an agreement any time
soon, so we are reluctantly canceling the first two weeks, "
deputy commissioner Russ Granik said.
</P>
<P>
The NBA had been the only major American professional sport
that had never lost a game due to a labor dispute.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Crvena Zvezda Belgrade asked
UEFA to return their European matches to Belgrade after Tuesday's
peace agreement which defused much of the tension in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The European soccer's governing body had ordered Zvezda to pl
ay a UEFA Cup first-leg tie with Olympique Lyon on October 20 at
a neutral venue because of the political situation in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The decision also applied to Partizan Belgrade, set to play
Lazio in the Cup Winners' Cup on November 5.
</P>
<P>
UEFA told Zvezda on Tuesday it was monitoring the political
situation and would make its final decision at 12:00 GMT on
Thursday.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party has buckled to criticism
of its power structure by appointing an independent auditor to
supervise its 1.8 million U.S. dollars to be paid by the
Australian Electoral Commission next week as reimbursement of
election expenses.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- As North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces primed cruise
missiles for attacks on Serbia Tuesday night, Western leaders gave
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic a four-day deadline to honor
his new promise to end the conflict in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- Business, unions and the opposition in the state of Victoria
Tuesday criticized the terms of reference for the gas commission,
warning they failed to examine the role of the state government
and it was needed to review the structure of the gas industry.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- Australia's richest man and media tycoon Kerry Packer beat
the Australian Taxation Office in a federal court Tuesday, which

<HEADLINE> Hoddle Up-beat on England's Chances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 13 (Xinhua) -- England manager Glenn Hoddle
was in an up-beat mood ahead of Wednesday's vital clash in
Luxembourg despite a disappointing goalless draw with Bulgaria at
the European Soccer Championship qualifying match last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said in a press conference on Tuesday: "We have let
ourselves down over these last two matches against Sweden and
Bulgaria but we have got to address that - and we can start by
winning tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
"That will put us in a better position for when we resume our
campaign in March," he added.
</P>
<P>
England have three injury worries ahead of the encounter in
the form of Graeme Le Saux (foot), Teddy Sheringham (calf) and
Sol Campbell (knee).
</P>
<P>
With Andy Hinchcliffe already out of contention through
injury, Le Saux's injury is of most concern - and if he is ruled
out, then Manchester United's Phil Neville is the obvious
candidate to fill in the left wing-back role.
</P>
<P>
Hoddle said: "Le Saux and Sheringham are unlikely to train
tonight. We are hoping that Sol will be okay to join in and I
would say the other two are more of a doubt ahead of tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
Hoddle also told Paul Gascoigne that he can still have a
future with England if he wins his battle to overcome his drink
problem.
</P>
<P>
Hoddle said: "A lot of people have tried to help Paul
Gascoigne in the past but this is the first step in him trying to
address the situation himself. I think that's a good and positive
sign for him.
</P>
<P>
"As regards playing for England again, the door has always
been left open for Paul Gascoigne if he can regain his top form,
" he added.

<HEADLINE> Merrill Lynch Cuts 3,400 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The leading U.S. brokerage
firm, Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., Tuesday announced the cut of 3,400
jobs, the first major job slashing by a U.S. financial company
stemming from the stock market downturn.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 3,400 job cuts, the brokerage said that it
would trim some 900 jobs that are filled primarily by outside
consultants who are mainly involved in technology projects.
</P>
<P>
The job cuts were announced by David Komansky, chairman and
chief executive of Merrill Lynch, at a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
"Because of the uncertainties now apparent in the global
economy, we anticipate a much more challenging environment ahead,"
Komansky said. "That is why we are implementing an energetic
program to reduce expenses and selectively resize certain
businesses."
</P>
<P>
The cuts account for five percent of the company's labour
force.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. investment giant Tuesday also reported a loss of 164
million U.S. dollars for the third quarter, down from earnings of
502 million U.S. dollars in the same period in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Lewis-Holyfield Fight set for Early </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Evander Holyfield and Lennox
Lewis may have a chance to fight for a world title early next
year.
</P>
<P>
Promoters Don King and Panos Eliades said on Tuesday that they
had agreed a deal to go ahead with a fight in February or March.
The fight is set to provide the first undisputed world champion
since Mike Tyson unified the titles in 1987.
</P>
<P>
World Boxing Association (WBA) and International Boxing
Federation (IBF) champion Holyfield and World Boxing Council(WBC)
title-holder Lewis have yet to sign contracts, even though the
boxer's financial demands appear to have been met.
</P>
<P>
The promoters hope agreement can be reached in principle by
Friday. "The fight is on. I have already talked to Evander and
the fight is on," Holyfield promoter King said. "We do not want
no outs.
</P>
<P>
"It is very important that this fight takes place. The
credibility of boxing is in the doldrums...It's reality. It's no
longer a dream."
</P>
<P>
"We have done the deal and agreed terms, " Eliades added.
</P>
<P>
"Don's job is to get Evander to sign the contract and I have
to get Lennox to sign the contract...There is no fight until both
contracts have been signed by both, however."
</P>
<P>
The promoters have set two possible dates for the fight --
February 27 or March 6. King said no venue had yet been set but
he said South Africa had shown a great deal of interest in
staging the event.
</P>
<P>
"I'll go wherever I can get the money," King said. "South
Africa are interested...Now there is no site but we will find
one."
</P>
<P>
If South Africa does not come off, it is more than likely that
the casino tables of Las Vegas will provide the backdrop.
</P>
<P>
A re-match has also been written into the deal, hammered out
by King and Eliades in nearly seven hours of talks in London on
Monday, should Briton Lewis win the fight.
</P>
<P>
American Holyfield, now 36, has indicated he would like to
unify the three main titles before retiring in 2000. Lewis,
33,has been chasing the unified world title since winning the
Seoul Olympic gold medal for Canada a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
King, never prone to understatement, has called Lewis "the
most wanted man on planet earth".
</P>
<P>
"Evander is hungry for it, we are after him," he said. "We are
here to talk about Lewis -- the unknown champion that is going to
become visible.
</P>
<P>
"He has been playing the invisible man but we are going to
bring him into full visibility, " he added.

<HEADLINE> 10 Cloned Calves Born in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Ten cloned heifer calves
have been born at AgResearch's Ruakura Center near Hamilton in
central-western North Island of New Zealand, the New Zealand Press
Association (NZPA) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Local scientists believe this is the biggest set of identical
animals cloned from a single adult.
</P>
<P>
The cloned calves are all genetically identical to each other
and to their four-year-old mother. They are distinguishable by
their different black and white markings.
</P>
<P>
NZPA quoted AgResearch scientist David Wells as saying the
calves were all cloned of a high-performing Friesian dairy cow.
They were produced in a laboratory using somatic cell nuclear
transfer, the process that produced Dolly the sheep, the world's
first cloned animal, in which an adult cell was fused with an egg.
</P>
<P>
Ruakura's cloning team, led by Dr. Wells, was the second in the
world to produce a cloned lamb.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Wells said the research now focuses on identifying factors
that affect the efficiency of the cloning process.
</P>
<P>
"The process of cloning from adult cells is still very much an
experimental one in a number of areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
The work now aims at increasing the number of successful
pregnancies from cloned embryos, he added.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand To Boost Off-Shore Tourism Promotion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- More than 12.5 million New
Zealand dollars (6.6 million U.S. dollars) would be pumped next
year into promoting New Zealand as a tourist destination for the
new millennium.
</P>
<P>
In a series of tourism promotion plans, which were released
here Wednesday, New Zealand Tourism Minister Murray McCully said
New Zealanders are in danger of being "too slow to recognize the
opportunities springing from millennium events planned for the
next 18 months".
</P>
<P>
The events include next year's APEC meetings and the America's
Cup, and the Golf World Cup next month.
</P>
<P>
They would attract millions of viewers and international media
attention, McCully stressed.
</P>
<P>
The extra funding is a "recognition that New Zealand will enjoy
international branding and profiling opportunities next year, the
like of which we will not see for several decades", he said.
</P>
<P>
McCully said the New Zealand Government plans to use the
tourism money to draw in 1.54 million visitors, up eight percent
over this year's likely arrivals, and 3.5 billion NZ dollars
(1.85 billion U.S. dollars) in tourism earnings (excluding
airfares), up 11 percent on the 1998 forecast.
</P>
<P>
According to the tourism minister, the additional funding
announced today will substantially be spent in New Zealand's three
traditional markets of North America, Australia and Britain.

<P>
HANGZHOU, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Preparations for construction
of an expressway linking major cities in east China's Zhejiang
Province are progressing smoothly.
</P>
<P>
The planned 175-km Ningbo-Jinhua Expressway, projected to cost
five billion yuan, will run through the cities of Fenghua,
Shengzhou, Dongyang and Yiwu. The mileage of the new expressway is
33 percent less than the combined length of existing highways in
the region, according to official of the Ningbo Transportation
Committee.
</P>
<P>
The major industrial and commercial cities of Ningbo, Shaoxing
and Jinhua are also located along the expressway. Beilun Port in
Ningbo handles more than 10 percent of Zhejiang's annual
import-export volume.
</P>
<P>
The expressway will facilitate commercial exchanges and
cooperation between the aforementioned cities and surrounding
areas.

<HEADLINE> Security Council to Introduce Resolution on Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council will on Wednesday resume consultations on Angola and
discuss a draft resolution on the possible extension of the
mandate of the U.N. Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA), Jeremy
Greenstock, the council president, said on Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came at the end of the council's consultations on
Angola, at which Issa Diallo, special representative of the U.N.
secretary-general for Angola, briefed the 15 Security Council
members on the current situation in the African country.
</P>
<P>
"The council expresses warm support for the special
representative in taking forward his mission in Angola in what a
really quite difficult circumstance at present," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council is expected to discuss a proposal put
forward by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to extend the mandate
of MONUA for up to six weeks, so that his special representative
could have more chances to contact all parties concerned in order
to avert another war in the country.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that Angolan Government recently threatened to cut
off all contacts with the U.N. special representative if he
continued to deal with Jonas Savimbi, head of the rebel UNITA, who
was disqualified by the Government for the partership in the
political dialogue under the 1994 Lusaka Protocol.
</P>
<P>
Angola was plunged into a civil war shortly after its
independence in 1975. The international community has blamed
Savimbi and the UNITA leadership for stalling the peace process.
</P>
<P>
MONUA comprises 725 military personnel and 388 civilian police
observers, compared with a U.N. presence of more than 7,000 in the
early phase of the peace process.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 13 (Xinhua) -- European bourses closed mixed on
Tuesday after a fading two-day rally, while the soft U.S. dollar
was proving a burden to sentiment.
</P>
<P>
Traders in the London market were unable to resist taking
profits from yesterday's record points gain in the FTSE 100, as
weaker international markets unhinged sentiment.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 ended the day down 47 at 4990, on robust volume of
986m shares traded.
</P>
<P>
The index attempted a dramatic recovery from the early
Asian-inspired weakness, only to be undone by a nervous session on
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The Dow finished well off its best in yesterday's session,
which combined with a steep reverse in Tokyo, to force a swift
session low in London of 4956, as yesterday's 214-point surge was
soon forgotten.
</P>
<P>
The index started to come back to life amid solid index futures
and news that underlying inflation had hit the government's target
for the second month running in September. But the FTSE's battle
to hold above the 5000-level was lost as the Dow was unable to
stay above 8000.
</P>
<P>
"We saw some profit-taking when the index moved above 5000
today," one trader said. "Things seem to have settled down, but
its really just guesswork how the international markets are going
to perform."
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares finished marginally higher,
reflecting investors' worries about a weak dollar.
</P>
<P>
The leading Dax index finished 49 higher at 4,274 although the
electronically-traded Xetra Dax closed slightly down. Yesterday,
the Xetra Dax posted the sharpest increase in its one-year
history, gaining 298 points, or 7.5 percent at the close.
</P>
<P>
Early-session profit-taking coupled with fears of a stronger
Deutschmark had sparked off some sharp early weakness in the
leading index.
</P>
<P>
The market's partial recovery at midday was connected to a
slight rebound in the value of the dollar. Domestic "haven" shares
gained on the loss of dollar-sensitive stocks like those in the
car and chemicals sectors.
</P>
<P>
Energy concerns also posted technical gains on the back of
their recent underperformance.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, French stock prices recovered from earlier losses as
investors went bargain hunting. The leading Cac 40 index finished
up 15 points at 3,279.
</P>
<P>
"French stocks are holding up well after the recent rises,"
said a trader at a Japanese brokerage house in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Stocks rose yesterday on the back of positive news from Japan
and global efforts toward resolving hedge-fund problems. But
stocks had fallen earlier today on profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
"The CAC should remain between 3050 and 3400 within the next
two weeks," said a trader at a French brokerage house. "The
direction of the French stock market will depend on Japan and the
U.S."

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for Ceasefire in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Tuesday urged a cessation of all military activity
in East Timor and a substantial reduction of the Indonesian
military presence in the Territory.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by his spokesman said he was concerned by
the rising tensions there and was particularly "disturbed by
reports of armed clashes in the Territory" and by remarks of local
officials to provoke large-scale protests in the last few days.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General would like to underline that, in view of
the important opportunities that have been created for a resolution
of the question of East Timor through the negotiations under his
auspices...it is incumbent on all parties concerned to avoid
taking steps that could jeopardize or unnecessarily complicate
the delicate efforts to find a just settlement to this long
running dispute," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Annan "intends to further intensify his consultations with East
Timorese leaders with a view to enduring their active involvement
in the negotiating process," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
East Timor with a population of 800, 000 and an area of 18,889
square kilometers has been a dispute between Indonesia and
Portugal since 1975 and the U.N. has been seeking a just,
comprehensive and internationally-acceptable solution to the
question.
</P>
<P>
Annan brokered a dialogue on the autonomy of the Territory
between Indonesia, Portugal and his personal representative in
August, and talks between the parties are continuing.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Presses Yugoslavia to Make Serious Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Tuesday
pressed Yugoslavia to make "serious progress" towards the end of
the Kosovo crisis within four days as a condition to avoid air
strikes from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton told reporters on Tuesday that
there was a good chance of averting NATO air strikes against
Yugoslav military targets, but it all depended on Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
"We prefer compliance over conflict, and we hope that will be
the case, but whether it is or not is entirely up to him now,"
Clinton said a day after NATO decided to give Yugoslavia four days
for complying with U.N. demands to avoid air strikes.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said
Milosevic must make immediate moves toward complying with U.N.
demands on stopping a Serb offensive against ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Berger said Milosevic must maintain an 11-day ceasefire,
withdraw the Serb forces from Kosovo and allow a team of 2,000
international observers into Kosovo and cooperate with it so it
can verify Serb compliance.
</P>
<P>
He also said humanitarian agencies must be allowed in to care
for the refugees and see that they are on their way home. And a
timetable for negotiations with Kosovo Albanians on their demands
for autonomy must be established.
</P>
<P>
However, he noticed that all these could hardly be done within
four days. "Obviously, not all these things are going to be
accomplished in 96 hours," said Berger. "We want to see serious
progress toward compliance."
</P>
<P>
Berger said Serb compliance will be monitored from the air by a
system of NATO reconnaissance planes and from land by 2,000
unarmed observers including Americans.
</P>
<P>
He said the observer force would begin to be formed soon and a
leader of the force could be named later on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Serbian Govt Endorses Kosovo Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The Serbian government on
Tuesday fully endorsed the accord reached earlier in the day by
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. special envoy
Richard Holbrooke to ease the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The accord, which allows 2,000-strong force of the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe to monitor the situation in
Serbia's southern province of Kosovo, was endorsed at a special
session of the Serbian cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Mirko
Marjanovic, according to a statement issued by the Serbian
Information Ministry.
</P>
<P>
It said the Serbian government believed the agreement has
"fully preserved the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the
country, averted a conflict and lay the conditions for a political
dialogue" on the basis of legal systems of the country.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the deal, finally hammered out after
nine-day intensive negotiations, was based on the principles that
"political approach and a peaceful solution of problems in Kosovo
achieved through dialogue are the only acceptable means for
reaching settlement on all issues.
</P>
<P>
It said one of the principles was that any solution for Kosovo
issue must respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty and
internationally recognized boundaries of Yugoslavia, which is
formed by the two remaining republics of the former Yugoslavia --
Serbia and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
Under the principle of full respect of equality of all citizens
and national communities in Kosovo, citizens in Kosovo shall
govern themselves democratically through assemblies, executive and
judicial organs of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Free and fair elections for Kosovo authorities, including
those on the communal level, will be held within nine months and
the Yugoslav government invites the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe to supervise those elections to ensure their
openness and fairness," the Serbian government statement said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, police force under local direction will be
established, to be formed by representative of local population
and coordinated by Kosovo administrative authority, it added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Venture Capital Investments in Internet Hit Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Silicon Valley remains the
No. 1 attraction for U.S. venture capital, receiving over half of
Internet investments during the second quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
U.S. venture capital investments in Internet-related companies
hit a record 887 million dollars in 164 companies in the quarter,
up 42 percent over the period a year ago, according to a new
survey announced Tuesday by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), one of
the world's largest professional services organizations. The
survey covered 500 venture capital firms in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Silicon Valley companies received 55 percent of the money, with
487 million dollars invested in 97 deals. New England was next
with 218 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that size of the deals continued to grow.
During the first half of this year, the top ten Internet-related
venture capital investments each surpassed 20 million dollars, as
an increasing number of investments shifted from early stage
companies to expansion and later stage companies.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1.35 billion dollars were invested in the first half
of the year.
</P>
<P>
The majority of Internet investments were made in early and
expansion stage companies during the second quarter. But the
investments in early stage companies declined from 48 percent in
1997 to 37 percent in the first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Internet companies specializing in services
accounted for the largest share of the investments in the first
six months of this year, with 455 million dollars or 34 percent of
the total. Next came software, 31 percent, and
access/infrastructure, 29 percent. PwC said that investments in
Internet service companies should continue to increase as more
businesses begin to take advantage of the explosion in e-commerce.

<HEADLINE> IAEA Pursues Free Access to Inspection Sites in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) reiterated on Tuesday that it has not found
any evidence that Iraq possesses nuclear weapons, while insisting
on being given free and full access to new inspection sites.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's nuclear weapons related assets have been destroyed,
removed or rendered harmless and the related infrastructure is
under ongoing monitoring and verification (OMV), IAEA Director
General Mohamed Elbaradei told the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
There are no indications that Iraq has any practical capability
for the production of weapon-usable nuclear material in quantities
of any practical significance, he said when briefing the council
on the progress of OMV in the last six months.
</P>
<P>
Available information also provides no indication that Iraq has
assembled nuclear weapons with or without fissile cores, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Elbaradei said, "there is an inevitable degree of
uncertainty in the technically coherent picture that has evolved
of Iraq's clandestine nuclear program".
</P>
<P>
The IAEA sees "a few outstanding questions and concerns" which
need to be resolved, although they "do not either individually or
collectively provide any impediment to the full implementation of
the Agency's OMV plan", he said.
</P>
<P>
He listed them as:
</P>
<P>
-- the status of the nuclear weapon design in April 1991,
including the provision of engineering drawings and models, and
the provision of centrifuge drawings obtained rom foreign
assistance,
</P>
<P>
-- the extent of external assistance to the clandestine nuclear
program,
</P>
<P>
-- the timing and modalities of Iraq's abandonment of its
clandestine nuclear program including the adoption of the
necessary penal laws.
</P>
<P>
The IAEA head said the Agency's current inability to inspect
new sites "seriously weakens" a "vital component of the Agency's
OMV plan".
</P>
<P>
Certification by the IAEA that all Iraq's nuclear weapons have
been accounted for and cannot be rebuilt is a requirement for any
easing or lifting of U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq since its 1990
invasion of kuwait.

Special Commission in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction, told the Security Council this morning that
the results would be evaluated by experts on October 22 and 23,
Council President Jeremy Greenstock told reporters.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. sources, attending the meeting on October
22 and 23 will be experts from the American, French and Swiss

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The Socialist Party of Serbia
(SPS) and the Yugoslav Left (JUL) party on Tuesday fully backed an
accord reached earlier in the day on a peaceful solution to the
Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The accord, struck by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and
U.S. special envoy Richar Holbrooke, allows a 2,000-strong force
of OSCE (Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe) to
ensure the compliance of U.N. resolutions, thus averting an
imminent air strike threatened by NATO.
</P>
<P>
It was "a victory of a principled and well-founded policy"
pursued by President Milosevic, said a joint statement with JUL by
the press office of the SPS, the ruling party of the country.
</P>
<P>
It said the agreement removed the threat of military
intervention against Yugoslavia and enabled the defense of the
country's territorial integrity and independence.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, local ethnic Albanians, who account for 90
percent of 2 million population in Kosovo, shall enjoy autonomy
within Serbia, which forms the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia with
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
"The constructive policy pursued so far is the basis of a
lasting political solution to the autonomy of Kosovo within Serbia
in line with the principles of equality of all the people in the
province," the statement said.

NEW YORK, October 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks pulled back on
Tuesday, mostly affected by the report of lower sales in the third
quarter by Eastman Kodak, a blue-chip component.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed 63.33 points lower at
7938.14 after recovering from a 116-point loss which put the index
below this year's starting point, 7908.25.
</P>
<P>
The Dow, which had gained almost 550 points from Thursday's
low, suffered an equivalent of nearly 50 point loss from Kodak,
which reported a 72 percent earnings' growth over last year's
third quarter, but it saw a 10 percent drop in sales and foresaw a
not so encouraging fourth-quarter update.
</P>
<P>
Broader market indicators also pulled back, with the
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index falling 36.64 to 1509.44.

JERUSALEM -- About 21,000 Palestinian workers are allowed to
enter Israel as of Tuesday after the Israeli army eased a 10-day
closure on Gaza and the West Bank and lifted a curfew on downtown
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The blockade was eased early Tuesday morning, several hours
after the nine-day Jewish holiday of Sukkot, a holiday to
celebrate harvest and commemorate the days the God led Israelis
out of Egypt in ancient times, ended.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army sealed off Gaza and the West Bank last month
following the threats by Islamic Resistence Movement (Hamas) to
attack Israel in retaliation of the killing of its two members
by Israeli soldiers.

The closure was eased briefly for several times but re-imposed
