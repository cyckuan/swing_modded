<HEADLINE> Vietnam Welcomes More Thai Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Vietnamese Foreign
Minister Nguyen Dy Nien said here Wednesday that the door of
Vietnam is open to more investors from Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Nien made the remarks during a meeting with Thai Prime Minister
Chuan Leekpai, Thai Foreign Ministry Spokesman Don Pramudwinai
said.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Nien said Vietnam appreciated the efforts of
the Thai government and the achievements it has achieved to
resolve the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that more Thai investors will go to Vietnam as the
economic situation in Thailand is improving.
</P>
<P>
Chuan expressed the hope that certain regulations that have
been a hindrance to foreign investment in Vietnam would be
adjusted so that more Thai investment could enter the country.
</P>
<P>
Nien said Vietnam's parliament will amend the investment
regulations in April to boost foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
According to spokesman Don, Vietnam and Thailand are discussing
visa exemption to facilitate business trips between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Nien arrived here Monday for a four-day visit to make
preparations for an official visit by Vietnamese Prime Minister
Pan Van Khai in May.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese foreign minister also sought Thailand's support
for Vietnam's bid to join the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Nien said Vietnam would listen to suggestions from Thailand in
its capacity as president of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN), as Vietnam will take over the rotating presidency
of the regional grouping after ASEAN foreign ministers' annual
meeting here in July.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed bilateral economic cooperation and plans
for developing the Great Mekong region and an East-West corridor
linking Vietnam, Laos and Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanians Urge Government to Investigate Cults </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Pang Yong
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanians has asked their
government to investigate into the conduct of break-away radical
religious sects to avoid reoccurrence of the March 17 tragedy
taking place in Uganda in which more than 900 members of a
Doomsday cult were slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
In a random interview carried out by the official Daily News in
Dar es Salaam on Thursday, citizens said the Tanzanian government
should act timely to prevent the country from falling into a
similar disaster as signs show that such cults do exist in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"The national intelligence agency should dig into the matter
before it is too late," said an army official who preferred
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
"They will come up with unthinkable outcomes as there are sects
which are either in the course to or at advanced stage close to
the Ugandan cult," he said.
</P>
<P>
John Masuha , a professor from the University of Dar es Salaam,
was quoted as saying that he is in favor of such a move by the
government provided it does not interfere with people's freedom of
worship.
</P>
<P>
J. Muhimbi, director of finance and administration at the
Parastatal Pension Fund, said the government should take cautious
measures to see the murders never happen in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The government should find proper ways to get the inside
picture of the suspicious sects so that no Tanzanian dies in "such
shame and nonsense deaths."
</P>
<P>
More than 530 charred bodies were found in the burnt-out
remains of a church in the town of Kanungu in southwest Uganda on
March 17. The fire was originally thought to have been a mass
suicide, but in the wake of more grisly discoveries, police are
now treating the case as mass murder.
</P>
<P>
Police suspect that the leaders of the Movement for the
Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God have been
systematically killing their followers for months after a
prediction that the world would end with the second millennium
failed to come true.

<HEADLINE> Two Million Mozambicans Affected by Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Currently, the total number of
people directly or indirectly affected by flooding in Mozambique
is more than two millions, half of whom are in need of food aid,
said Foreign Minister Leonardo Simao here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the parliament, the Assembly, Simao said that the
known death toll stands at 640, with a further 95 people missing
and about half million people were displaced, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the government has set up 121
accommodation centers to provide shelter, food and medical care
for the homeless.
</P>
<P>
He said his country has lost 140,000 hectares of cultivated
land, or 22 percent of the farmland in the five provinces
affected. Over 124,000 households have lost their crops and
agricultural tools, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said a significant number of cattle, goat and poultry have
fallen victim to the floods, adding that a complete survey of
these losses is still under way.
</P>
<P>
"More than 90 percent of the country's operational irrigation
infrastructures were damaged," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said serious damage has been done to industries in Matola,
adjoining Maputo, and in the Limpopo Valley cities of Chokwe and
Xai-Xai.
</P>
<P>
As for the trading network, 880 shops and 118 wholesalers were
damaged, effectively paralyzing the normal patterns of trade in
flood-affected area. As a result, Simao said, supply has slumped,
with prices soaring up.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Receives $58 Million Aid for Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique has received 56, 6
million U.S. dollars in kind and 1.4 million U.S. dollars in cash
since it made a call for international aid on February 24 to help
the country hit by a severe flooding.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the parliament, the Assembly, on Thursday on the flood
situation, Foreign Minister Mozambican Leonardo Simao said that
the aid the government called for is estimated at 65,7 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
He thanked the international community for its support, and
told the Assembly that, at the height of the rescue operations,
donors made available 59 aircraft and 182 boats.
</P>
<P>
According to Simao, at present the government could not produce
any definitive list of the losses caused, since several
infrastructures are still under water.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Welcomes OPEC Production Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Thursday welcomed the
agreement reached by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) to increase production, but said it would not
raise its own output.
</P>
<P>
Oil Minister Sameh Fahmi said Egypt supports any effort by OPEC
or non-OPEC producers to strike a balance between supply and demand
in the interest of both producers and consumers to stabilize the
world oil market.
</P>
<P>
He said prices between 18 and 22 U.S. dollars a barrel of oil
are considered reasonable. Production cuts adopted by both OPEC and
non-OPEC producers since early last year had sent oil prices
soaring above 30 dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
The minister, meanwhile, stressed that Egypt will not increase
its current production of crude oil at about 800,000 barrels per
day.
</P>
<P>
During a ministerial meeting in Vienna, Austria, most OPEC
members agreed on Wednesday to increase their oil production by
some 1.45 million barrels per day from April 1. This will raise
their total production to over 21 million barrels a day, the level
prior to the March 1999 production cut.

<HEADLINE> Over 20 Injured in "Land Day" Protests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Over 20 people were injured on
Thursday in clashes between Israeli security forces and Palestinian
demonstrators marking the Palestinian "Land day."
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators were protesting against Israel's confiscation
of their lands and the spread of Jewish settlements and military
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Reports from northern Israel said some 10,000 Israeli Arabs in
the Arab town of Sakhnin joined the Thursday demonstration and
hundreds of them clashed with Israeli security forces.
</P>
<P>
They stormed an army base being built on the expropriated ground
west of the town, tore down fencing and set fire on the site.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli security forces responded by firing tear gas and
rubber-coated bullets towards the demonstrators, hurting at least
15.
</P>
<P>
The director of the Sakhnin medical center said 12 were lightly
wounded, two suffered head wounds and another had a broken leg.
</P>
<P>
Local Arab leaders said the protest had been peaceful but went
out of control when security forces intervened.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Minister of Public Security Shlomo Ben-Ami rushed to the
town Thursday afternoon to help local Arab leaders put the
situation under control by asking both Israeli security forces and
local Arabs to remain calm.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Arabs protest each year on March 30 to mark the "Land
Day" to commemorate the killing by Israeli forces of six Arabs in
Sakhnin during a demonstration against the confiscation of
thousands of hectares of Arab-owned land in 1976.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Arabs, or the Palestinians who remained in Israel after
its creation in 1948, have historically complained of entrenched
discrimination and the loss of lands confiscated by the Israeli
authorities to build Jewish towns and military bases.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip also held protest
rallies on Thursday to mark the "Land Day."
</P>
<P>
Outside the West Bank town of Nablus, hundreds of protesters
stoned Israeli soldiers in two locations. Troops fired tear gas and
rubber-coated steel pellets, wounding five Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The land protests in the Palestinian territories took a special
significance this year given a pledge by Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat to declare an independent Palestinian state in 2000 with or
without a final peace agreement with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Arafat told Palestinians in a televised address on Wednesday
that Israel had "raped" their homeland and "colonized it by the
force of occupation."

<HEADLINE> Britain against Unilateral Palestinian Statehood: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A visiting British official said here
Thursday that his country is opposed to a unilateral declaration of
Palestinian statehood in case of failure to reach agreement with
Israel by September this year.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State at the Foreign Office Peter Hain made the
remark during a meeting with Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative
Council Ahmed Qureia, also known as Abu Ala, in the West Bank city
of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has repeatedly announced to
declare an independent state by September, with or without a peace
deal with Israel.
</P>
<P>
According to the Palestinian News Agency, Hain, who is in charge
of the Middle East affairs, and Qureia, discussed issues of common
concern, with emphasis on parliamentary affairs and the
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Qureia said the problems facing the talks emanate from Israel's
failure to implement the signed accords. He underscored the
necessity for Israel to return the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) at the final-stage
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli government tries to evade carrying out the final
withdrawal on which agreements were reached with former governments
of (Yitzhak) Rabin, (Shimon) Peres and (Benjamin) Netanyahu," he
added.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Hain affirmed Britain supports the establishment
of an independent Palestinian state and will recognize and help it
in the future.
</P>
<P>
However, he said Britain is opposed to a unilateral declaration
of Palestinian statehood if the Palestinian-Israeli talks failed to
reach a deal on permanent peace by September 13.
</P>
<P>
Such a declaration will not serve the interest of the
Palestinians themselves, he asserted.
</P>
<P>
The British minister highlighted the importance of solving the
problem of the Palestinian refugees, noting that the international
community should shoulder the responsibility of settling this
problem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat met Hain Thursday afternoon at the presidential office in
Ramallah. During the meeting Hain reaffirmed his country's support
for the right of Palestinians to self-determination and statehood,
according to Voice of Palestine radio.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Invited by Yemeni Counterpart for Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on
Thursday received a letter from his Yemeni counterpart Ali Abdullah
Saleh to invite him for a trip to Sanaa.
</P>
<P>
Saddam was invited to attend the 10th anniversary of Yemen's
reunification which falls on May 22, the Iraqi News Agency
reported. Saddam has never travelled abroad since the end of Gulf
War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The letter was conveyed by visiting Yemeni Minister of Legal and
Parliamentary Affairs Abdallah Ahmed Ghanem during his meeting with
Saddam.
</P>
<P>
The letter also includes a call by Yemen to immediately convene
an Arab summit meeting which Iraq should attend, said the INA.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni minister praised Iraq's role in helping Yemen achieve
reunification in 1990, while Saddam thanked Yemen for supporting
Iraq in dealing with international affairs and calling for lifting
of the decade-old U.N. sanctions on Iraq, the INA said.
</P>
<P>
Yemen, a close ally of Iraq, sided Saddam during the Gulf war
which was triggered by Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. It was also
opposed to the four-day air strikes on Iraq unleashed by the U.S.
and Britain in December 1998 for what they called Iraqi
intransigence.
</P>
<P>
Yemen has been calling for an end to the crippling U.N.
sanctions against Iraq and for an Arab summit meeting to discuss
regional and Arab affairs.

<HEADLINE> Ambassador Defends China's Human Rights Situation in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"In 1999, the Chinese government continued to concentrate its
effort on economic development in the light of its national
conditions," Ambassador Qiao Zonghuai told the 56th session of the
United Nations Commission on Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
While achieving the GDP growth of 7.1 percent last year, he
said, China adopted policies to ensure the rule of law so as to
provide legal and institutional guarantee for the civil and
political rights of its citizens.
</P>
<P>
Qiao outlined China's achievements in the promotion and
protection of human rights in five major aspects:
</P>
<P>
First, human rights legislation has been strengthened. The Law
on Administrative Review offers new remedies to citizens whose
rights are violated by administrative bodies. The recently adopted
Law on Legislation clearly provides that any derogation from civil
and political rights and any mandatory measure or punishment which
restricts personal freedom must be the subject of explicit laws to
that effect.
</P>
<P>
Second, a series of transparency policies have been adopted by
the judiciary to bring more openness in the police department, the
procurators' offices, the court and prison systems. Measures to
intensify supervision, to refine procedures of supervision, and to
improve on its effectiveness have been carried out vigorously and
have brought good results.
</P>
<P>
Third, in the exercise of the rule of law, corruption has been
severely dealt with by the authorities. China strives at having an
efficient government with integrity and good work ethics.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, pursuant to the new Law on the Organization of Village
Committees promulgated last year, the democratic process at the
village level has continued to develop. By holding direct
elections for the village committees and open discussions by way
of making decisions on important village matters, the rural
population has fully exercised its democratic right to participate
in elections,decision-making, management and supervision. In most
cases, over 90 percent of the electorate went to the polls.
</P>
<P>
Fifth, the freedom of expression and of assembly have been
protected in compliance with relevant laws. Freedom of the press
and check and balance by public opinions have been encouraged by
the government. By the end of 1999, the rapid growth in the use of
the Internet has brought about 8.9 million online users and 15,000
websites. China has the eighth largest number of online users
after major developed countries like the United States, Japan, the
United Kingdom, and Germany.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador also told the session that the state-run
project of bringing radio and television broadcast to every
village has been a great success.
</P>
<P>
There are now 1849 registered national associations in China,
which is a 91 percent increase from 1990 and civil societies at
the county level and above have reached the number of over 200,000,
he added.

<HEADLINE> Reno Urges Calm in Elian Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reno reiterated that the Clinton administration would try to be
patient amid the clamor over custody of Elian, voicing her concern
about possible unrest in Miami as the Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS) is discussing the case with the
family.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the INS ruled that the boy belong to his
father in Cuba and should be returned to Cuba. However, the boy's
relatives in Miami insisted the boy stay with them in the U.S. and
filed a political asylum for the boy.
</P>
<P>
A district judge ruled earlier this month that the Justice
Department has the only right in the case and INS decision to
return the boy should be respected. Elian's relatives then vowed
to appeal.
</P>
<P>
As the INS resumed discussion with the family over where the
boy should go, the Cuban-Americans are preparing a large protest
and the authorities feared that there might be an unrest in Miami.
</P>
<P>
Elian, who is currently under the custody of his great uncle,
Lazaro Gonzalez, in Florida, was rescued on November 25 last year
from a shipwreck after his mother and 11 others died when the boat
capsized in the sea off Florida.
</P>
<P>
"The mother died, the boy survived miraculously. Relatives have
taken him in and they have cared for him and love him dearly,"Reno
added.
</P>
<P>
"This case has been heartbreaking for everybody involved but we
believe the law is clear. The father must speak for the little boy
because there is a sacred bond that must be honored -- and the boy
must be reunited with his father," Reno told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Reno said the Justice Department could have moved by now to take
custody of the boy, but has practiced a patient, cautious approach.
</P>
<P>
"The relatives had their day in court and we gave them an
opportunity to file. A federal district court judge in Miami heard
their case and affirmed our decision," she said.
</P>
<P>
"We have been engaged in conversation and we are continuing
conversation in Miami to try to work out a resolution to ensure
that an appeal is heard in a timely way. And nothing will be done
to return Elian if that happens and everybody agrees that they
will abide by the ruling that comes down," Reno said.
</P>
<P>
Reports say the boy's father are planning to come to the United
States to take the boy back. Reno declined to say what the Justice
Department will do if he really travels to the United States from
Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Scientists Identify Gene for Heart Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Canadian scientists have
identified a gene for at least 50 percent of heart disease,
opening a way of predicting who is at serious risk of
cardiovascular disease and how it can be prevented.
</P>
<P>
The scientists find that a gene called p56lck is directly
responsible for helping the common coxsackievirus attack the heart,
causing heart failure and death in some patients, the country's
National Post said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The team led by Dr. Josef Penninger at the Ontario Cancer
Institute took the virus from the patient and put it into mice
during their six-year study, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The result was that mice mutated without the p56lck gene were
immune to heart troubles caused by the common coxsackievirus,
while those with the gene came down with severe destruction of the
heart muscle.
</P>
<P>
Most of the mice with the gene actually died because of the
virus infection, with those surviving the infection usually going
on to develop chronic heart disease, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"This research shows that heart disease is frequently caused by
viral or bacterial infections, which marks a huge shift in how we
try to understand these types of diseases and how we approach the
treatment," Dr. Penninger was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
There is no vaccine and no cure for the time being for
coxsackievirus, which is considered the most common cause of
infectious heart disease in children and up to 50 percent of adult
chronic heart disease patients.
</P>
<P>
About 70 percent of the human population carry the virus, which
gives us flu-like symptoms, but probably very often this virus
travels to the heart and triggers heart disease, said the
newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Donors Pledge 2.3b U.S. Dollars for Balkans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Donors from 47 countries and 36
institutions pledged 2.413 billion euro (2.3 billion U.S. dollars)
for the reconstruction and economic development in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
The two-day international donors conference, co-hosted by the
European Union and the World Bank, got more pledges than it had
originally expected.
</P>
<P>
World Bank President James Wolfensohn said at the start of the
conference that a total of 18 billion euro (1.72 billion dollars)
would be needed for the planned projects aimed to be started this
year.
</P>
<P>
The conference ended with an accumulated pledge of 2.413
billion euro for the six countries in southeastern Europe --
Albania, Bulgaria, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia and
Romania. The money will also be spent on projects inside Kosovo
and Montenegro, both parts of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Of the pledged total, the lion's share -- 1.833 billion euro(1.
75 billion dollars) -- will be used on economic reconstruction,
development and cooperation in the sector of infrastructure, or
projects that have regional impact, according to officials from
the European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
European bloc.
</P>
<P>
The chosen projects include construction and repair of roads,
bridges, power grids and water supply systems.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from both the European Union and the World Bank,
however, failed to give details as to which donor gave how much at
the Brussels conference.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission pledged 530 million euro (507 million
dollars). The money is expected to come from the commission's
annual budget, according to commission sources.
</P>
<P>
The border crossing at Blace between Kosovo and Macedonia will
be the first such project to get the international aid money to be
reconstructed. Reconstruction of parking places and weighing
facilities at the customs will start on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Johannes Linn, vice-president of the Europe and Central Asia
Region of the World Bank, gave a rough idea of how the
international donation would be given. He said that between 70
and 80 percent of the international pledges would be the
equivalents to grants instead of loans.
</P>
<P>
"The expectations which we had have been exceeded," said Bodo
Hombach, coordinator of the international Stability Pact for the
Balkans. "We are coming to the stage where projects become
reality."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ambassador Dissects U.S. Accusations Against Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador Qiao Zonghuai gave his answer to the above-
mentioned question here Thursday at the 56th session of the United
Nations Commission on Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said that there are at least three reasons for the U.S. to
make groundless accusations time again against the developing
world:
</P>
<P>
First and foremost, the haunting cold-war mentality and
hegemonist mindset. This is manifested in the strong sense of
superiority with which it has sought to impose its value system
and ideology on others.
</P>
<P>
In the U.S. mind, human rights issues only exist in developing
countries. Every move on the part of the developing countries may
become the object of moral judgment and accusation by the United
States which has granted itself the title of "World Policeman" and
"World Judge".
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department publishes annual reports on human
rights and on the religious freedom in the world, which is replete
with unfounded accusations against many developing countries. What
's more, it then goes on to invoke U.S. domestic laws to impose
sanctions on those countries. This is a most blatant move to show
that might is right.
</P>
<P>
The second reason is that of double standards. The U.S. not
only seeks to export its own belief, it also attempts to impose on
others what it dose not like for itself. For example, as an evil
cult, Falun Gong shares almost exactly the same characteristics as
the People's Temple or the Davidians in the U.S., including their
doomsday theory, the worship of the cult's leader and the dire
consequences on people's life and health.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. did not hesitate form using tanks and helicopters to
back up the police in its assault on the Davidians headquarters,
but it has seen it fit to call on the Chinese government to
accommodate and appease the evil cult Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
It is a basic legal principle that everyone is equal before the
law. When the U.S. moved against cult disciples by invoking that
principle, it was presented as an act to uphold the rule of law.
But when China acted likewise, it was portrayed as an attempt of
persecution of religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
The third reason is the politicization of human rights. When
domestic politics or partisan interests are involved, the U.S. has
no qualms in sacrificing the dignity and interests of developing
countries. Since this is an election year in the U.S., the
decision of the U.S. government to table an anti-China draft
resolution at the commission so as to score a political point for
itself.
</P>
<P>
Though it professes to be committed to the purpose of the
commission, which is that of promotion and protection of human
rights, it is precisely the U.S. itself that has, through its
actions, politicized its work, poisoned its atmosphere and
hampered its normal functions. By acting on this draft resolution,
the commission will only tarnish the lofty image of the cause of
human rights and bring harm to its own credibility.

</P>
<P>
It was said that Georgia would received a total of 500 million
marks. Georgia had received economic aid of half a billion marks
from Germany since it became independent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Germany pays closer attention to the situation in Caucasia and
Chechnya, especially to the political situation in Georgia where
the president election will be held on April 9, Schroeder wants to
express Germany's back for the current president Eduard
Shewardnadse to win the election again.

BERLIN, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The former American Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger met with the former German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl Thursday in Berlin. Kissinger's meeting with Kohl was under
heavy pressure because of the finance scandal of the German
opposition party Christian Democratic Union (CDU) since last
November.
</P>
<P>
Two famous leaders met with each other in Berlin's Adlon Hotel
and showed their intimate friendship to the public, but the topics

Kissinger will also meet with German president Johannes Rau,
but the meeting had been canceled because Rau was light injured by
an accident in his house.
</P>
<P>
Next Monday will be the 70th birthday of Helmut Kohl.
Originally the CDU will hold a celebration for him, but because of
the finance scandal of the party nobody will still arrange an
official celebration for Kohl's 70th birthday except Berlin's CDU
under the leadership of mayor Eberhard Diepgen.

<HEADLINE> French Scientist Suspects Human Being Has Been Cloned in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A prestigious French scientist said
on Thursday that he suspects at least one scientist in the United
States has cloned a human being, reported Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
During a seminar on the science of clone held at the Pompidou
Cener in Paris, Jean-Paul Renard, director of research at the
National Institute of Agro-Economic Research, said that in the
United States no law can efficiently forbid cloning of human being.
</P>
<P>
``If this cloning was attempted and succeeded, and has given
birth to a baby, its producer will wait for years, perhaps 10 or
15 years, before making it public, because he will make sure about
the good development of the clone and the legislation of the
country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
But he also said that this is purely his personal hypothesis as
the U.S. laboratories in the field of in vitro fertilization
usually lack enough money to do so.
</P>
<P>
Renard also said that for succeeding in cloning a human being,
one needs many human eggs, which means many women willing to
cooperate.

<HEADLINE> UK Railtrack Announces 52 Billion Pounds Cash Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 30 (Xinhua) - Railtrack has confirmed plans to
spend 52 billion pounds improving and extending Britain's rail net
work over the next 12 years.
</P>
<P>
The plans, part of Railtrack's annual Network Management
Statement (NMS), are based on estimates that passenger traffic on
the net work will rise by over 4 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
The NMS breaks down spending into a five-year period and the
entire 12-year period, committing it to spend 18.6 billion pounds
for the total menu in the five-year period.
</P>
<P>
The breakdown for the next five years shows Railtrack expects
to spend 10.6 billion pounds on maintaining the network over that
period, three billion of committed work and another five billion
pounds on recommended enhancements.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Railtrack's larger spending figure allowed
it to offer a suite of potential options to accommodate its
expectations for a 60 percent rise in passenger traffic over the
next 12 years.

<HEADLINE> More Cultists' Bodies Found in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan police have exhumed 81
more bodies of members of the cult Movement for the Restoration of
Ten Commandments of God in Bushenyi District in southwestern
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Police Deputy Spokesman John Kimera told Xinhua Thursday
evening that the bodies were discovered and exhumed in a mass
grave found in the home of a cult member named Joseph Nyamurinda.
</P>
<P>
Nyamurinda, who joined the cult in 1991, is suspected to have
been burnt to death with 18 other members of her family in the
Kanungu church fire on March 17, in which more than 530 cult
members were killed.
</P>
<P>
The newly-discovered bodies, found in a mass grave in Kabra
sub-county, include 60 females, 17 boys and four men, Kimera said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, who is now on a
two-day working visit to Britain, has blamed local officials for
ignoring intelligence reports that could have averted the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, more than 920 cult members have been established
murdered by the cult leaders who are most probably on the run.
</P>
<P>
Uganda hit international headlines since March 17 when hundreds
of cult members were burnt in a Kanungu church fire. A total of
six mass graves containing cultists' bodies have so far been
discovered.
</P>
<P>
According to police, several more sites are suspected to have
mass graves and they would be dug up one by one.
</P>
<P>
With more graves being found, investigations into the mass
murder were being carried out. Foreign investigators are expected
to offer a helping hand in the process.
</P>
<P>
Police said that they would alert Interpol to help arrest cult
leaders.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabweans Urged to Fulfil Economic Plan in Partnership Spirit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The implementation of the
Millennium Economic Recovery Program in Zimbabwe will entail the
collective participation of the government, the private sector,
labour and the academia in the true spirit of partnership.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Industry and Commerce Minister Nathan Shamuyarira
made the remarks when addressing this year's first meeting of the
National Economic Consultative Forum (NECF) core group here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said the bodies should cooperate fully to produce best
results in industrial development in the country.
</P>
<P>
"In developed countries there is a lot of cooperation between
the government, industry, labour unions and the academia. We
would like to encourage that here," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said one of the good results of the NECF over the past year
has been the promotion of cooperation between the three legs
"although we haven't had full participation of trade unions.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the reorganization in the labor
movement would come up with a body that would cooperate with the
government.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions said in January that it
would continue to boycott the NECF until the grouping is empowered
to implement decisions adopted by the three stakeholders of the
government, labour and business.
</P>
<P>
The government would be discussing the promotion of a social
contract this year to place responsibilities and challenges on
captains of industries, government ministries, labour unions and
academia, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"Lets all work together to bring about sustainable growth and
development for the benefit of all," he said. "We have the
necessary human resources, intellectual mix and talent to pull our
country to economic recovery and prosperity," he said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held in the midst of a serious economic crisis
facing the country characterized by an unstable macro-economic
environment, fuel shortages, unemployment and poverty.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Face Financing Gap of 218 Million U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Governor of the Reserve Bank of
Zimbabwe Leonard Tsumba Thursday said developments in the
country's balance of payments are expected to result in a
financing gap of 218 million U.S. dollars for this year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the first meeting of the National Economic
Consultative Forum core group, the governor said there would be
need to mobilize additional external balance of payments support
over the next nine months to maintain stability in the foreign
exchange market.
</P>
<P>
"In the absence of international donor support, the estimated
218 million financing gap can only be met from resources generated
from enhanced export performance or from further import demand
compression," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said given the continued decline in manufacturing exports,
foreign currency receipts would largely depend on enhanced
activity in the agriculture and mining sectors.
</P>
<P>
A sustained recovery in international commodity's prices would
be critical, especially in the cases of tobacco and gold, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the manufacturing sector has been adversely affected by
high production costs as well as by intense regional and
international competition.
</P>
<P>
According to Tsumba, the demand for fuel and energy has also
placed added burdens on the country's strained foreign currency
resources.
</P>
<P>
If the upward trend in oil prices continued, this would worsen
the foreign exchange situation, he said, stressing that there is
need to cut oil consumption to sustainable levels.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the governor said that the country's exports would
register a modest recovery during this year, growing by a
projected 4.2 percent to December.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture is expected to grow by 1.6 percent, mining by two
percent and manufacturing by 10.8 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
The country's inflation has slowed down to below 50 percent,
but this level is still above the target of single digit
inflation, he said.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Dissolves Chamber of Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government called an
extraordinary cabinet meeting on Wednesday to dissolve the Chamber
of Commerce and Industry, Rwanda News Agency reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to a communique from the cabinet, the Ministry of
Commerce, Industry and Tourism will temporarily take over all the
assets of the chamber, pending arrangement for the Federation of
the Rwandan Private Sector Associations to take over the role and
duties of the dissolved institution.
</P>
<P>
Pipian Hakizabera, Executive Secretary of the federation formed
in last December, said the defunct chamber of commerce was rather
narrow in scope, accommodating only part of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The newly formed federation will have a wider scope and will
embrace all players in the private and informal sector, he said.

CANBERRA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Australia will donate 3.2
million Australian dollars (1.86 million U.S. dollars) to the

<HEADLINE> Heavy Casualties Reported in Sri Lanka's Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The fierce fighting between
government troops and Tamil Tiger rebels have killed 85 soldiers
this week in the north of the country, the Ministry of Defense
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a statement that 613 soldiers had been
injured in the fighting which started on Monday in the
northernmost Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
It did not specify the casualties of the separatist rebels of
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) who have been fighting for
a separate homeland for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and
east since 1983.
</P>
<P>
But the ministry did say the LTTE had suffered heavy casualties
and some of their vehicles and boats had been destroyed by the
government's artillery, navy and air force.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE said Wednesday they had overrun a key military base in
Jaffna after an intense 12-hour battle that ended around noon
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement sent here from their office in London, the LTTE
said only 25 guerrillas were killed in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Government troops captured the Jaffna peninsula from the rebels
in 1996, but since then the LTTE rebels have been trying to retake
their former stronghold.
</P>
<P>
The upsurge in fighting came as President Chandrika Kumaratunga
wound up her fourth round of talks on Thursday with opposition
leader Ranil Wickremesinghe to seek consensus on constitutional
reform proposals aimed at ending the conflict.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi State Minister for
Disaster Management and Relief Talukdar Abdul Khaleq Thursday
called for joint efforts in facing natural calamities, saying
social participation is a safety net in disaster management.
</P>
<P>
He made the call at a seminar organized by Disaster Management
and Relief Ministry in celebration of the National Disaster
Preparatory Day.
</P>
<P>
Officer in Charge of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)
in Bangladesh Jun Kulita said in a message on the Day that
Bangladesh has been prone to natural hazards such as floods,
cyclones and earthquakes for centuries because of its geographical
disposition and geological composition.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF, he said, along with all the development partners,
stands by the people and the government of Bangladesh in their
effort to understand and combat such calamities.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF officer said the introduction of participatory
actions at the community level to understand and mitigate
different hazards is essential.
</P>
<P>
At the seminar, Acting Representative of United Nations
Development Program in Bangladesh Andre Klap also stressed the
importance of community involvement in all phases of the disaster
management, saying that it is one of the most reliable and
efficient ways of handling disaster and reducing vulnerability of
the community to disasters.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a huge colorful procession with banners and festoons
inscribed with different slogans was brought out in the capital
in observance of the Day under the management of Disaster
Management and Relief Ministry.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi President Stresses Ecological Balance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi President Shahabuddin
Ahmed Thursday urged farmers and others concerned to maintain the
ecological balance while strengthening food security.
</P>
<P>
"I hope everybody will join hands in strengthening food
security with the use of sustainable technology to maintain a
healthy environment," he said while distributing Bangabandhu Award,
the highest trophy in the agricultural field in the country.
</P>
<P>
"We need a clean environment along with nutritious food for
healthy life," he said.
</P>
<P>
Thirty farmers, agriculture officials and field workers and
voluntary organizations received this year's Bangabandhu Award for
their contributions to increased yields of crops, fishes,
livestock and crop diversification.
</P>
<P>
He termed the Bangabandhu Award as a major source of
inspiration for agricultural development, saying it was a
guideline for Bangladeshi people since agriculture was still the
mainstay of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Motia Chowdhury said that if the current
trend of production continues, "we will be able to attain self-
sufficiency in food by 2002."
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government has listed agriculture as a
priority sector and several steps were taken in the past years to
facilitate farmers with different incentives and promote agro-
based industries.
</P>
<P>
Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the first prime minister of
Bangladesh, introduced the Award after independence, which was
suspended by the successive governments after he was killed. It
was reintroduced after the return of the Awami League in the 1996
general elections.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt to Speed up Implementation Deal With IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Shocked by news that the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) would again delay its aid to
Indonesia, President Abdurrahman Wahid has asked his ministers to
speed up the implementation of the Letter of Intent (LoI) signed
by the IMF and the government in January.
</P>
<P>
"Gus Dur (as the president is known) will hold a cabinet
meeting on Saturday. We are sure that in the next one or two weeks
there will be some progress," Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab told
reporters after a meeting with Wahid here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
An IMF technical team had been due to arrive here this month to
observe the progress of the implementation of the LoI. But as some
points in the LoI have not been implemented yet by the Indonesian
government, the team has decided to postpone its visit.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after attending a Cabinet meeting with
the president, Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and
Industry Kwik Kian Gie said: "In the course of the cabinet meeting,
there were contacts (telephone) between the president and IMF high
ranking officials. So that through the contacts it is expected
there will be positive impacts."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cabinet Secretary Marsilam Simanjuntak who also
attended the meeting said the implementation of the LoI will be
speeded up two-fold and the president will directly preside over
such implementation until the IMF review team arrives here to
carry on its tasks to assess the progress the Indonesian
government has made.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, IMF Senior Representative in Indonesia John Dodsworth
said that a review of Indonesia's performance in implementing
previously agreed measures had originally been scheduled for early
April, but it will be now postponed for two weeks and the
disbursement of further financial assistance worth 400 million U.S.
dollars could only be done in May.
</P>
<P>
Although the bulk of the structural measures as agreed to in
the LoI were still outstanding, Dodsworth believed that such
points could be implemented in the next two weeks.

YANGON, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government Thursday
rejected the decision and recommendations adopted by the governing
body of the International Labor Organization (ILO) at its session
in Geneva Tuesday for submission to the 88th International Labor
Conference (ILC) to take drastic measures against the country
under the ILO constitution.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar Foreign Ministry charged in its press release here
that this action taken by the ILO governing body is a politically

The press release described the ILO action as aiming to exert
pressure on Myanmar, saying that the action ignored the positive
steps taken by the country regarding labor affairs.
</P>
<P>
"Myanmar completely dissociates itself from the aforementioned
decision of the governing body and any activities and effects
connected with it," the press release said.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Army to Spend $700 Million on Arms Procurement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Swiss government has approved an
arms procurement program worth 1.18 billion Swiss francs (about
700 million U.S. dollars) for the year 2000, according to a Swiss
Radio International report Thursday.
</P>
<P>
For one of the lowest budget in 15 years, the Swiss army will
buy 186 Swedish-built CV-9030 tanks, 120 battlefield command cars,
and some mine-clearing ploughs that can be fitted to armored
personnel carriers (APCs).
</P>
<P>
The CV-9030 APCs have already been ordered by the Swedish,
Norwegian, and Finnish armies. In Switzerland, the report said
that they will replace American-built M113 APCs, which on the
battlefield cannot keep up with the Swiss army's Leopard 2 tanks,
the mainstay of national defense.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the procurement program for 2000 is
the second smallest in 15 years, and reflects the defense ministry
's falling budget, as well as lack of clarity about equipment
needs before sweeping reforms, dubbed Army 21, are finalized.
</P>
<P>
The 120 battlefield command cars will be built by Mowag in
eastern Switzerland, and are based on the chassis of the widely-
used American Hummer military vehicle.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss army will be using them as a fire-control vehicle,
which can pinpoint targets up to seven kilometers away and pass
data on directly to artillery or integrated fire control systems.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economy Increases 7.3 Percent in Fourth Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy increased at
an annual rate of 7.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 1999, the
strongest performance in 15 years, the Commerce Department said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the gross domestic product (GDP), the country's
total output of goods and services, marked a better-than-expected
upward revision from an estimate a month ago that the GDP was
expanding at a 6.9 percent rate in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
The 7.3 percent rate of increase in the GDP in the fourth
quarter was the biggest quarterly surge since a 9 percent growth
rate in the first quarter of 1984.
</P>
<P>
The higher final estimate reflected new data showing that U.S.
exports were stronger than previously believed and business
construction was increasing at a faster pace than earlier
estimated.
</P>
<P>
With Thursday's GDP release, the government also issued further
benchmark revisions of the historical data, taking the figures
back to 1929, and made several corrections to the original updated
figures, which were released in October.
</P>
<P>
Those changes caused major revisions in growth rates for
several years, including most recently 1997, when GDP growth was
revised from a previous 4.2 percent to an even-stronger figure of
4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The GDP estimate for 1998 was unchanged at 4.3 percent but 1999
was revised upward, reflecting the new-found strength in the
fourth quarter, to 4.2 percent from the previous estimate of 4.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
An inflation index tied to the GDP showed that prices remained
well-controlled in the fourth quarter of last year, rising at an
annual rate of just 2 percent, up only slightly from a 1.7 percent
rate of increase in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department also reported Thursday that after-tax
corporate profits were up 2.7 percent in the fourth quarter, the
best showing since a 7.4 percent jump in the first quarter of 1999.
After-tax profits had been up 2.2 percent in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
For all of 1999, after-tax corporate profits jumped 8.8 percent,
the government said.

<HEADLINE> Pace Sails to Lead in Australia Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Frenchman Bertrand Pace and his
Le Defi Francais sailed into the top scoreboard after the third
day of the Australia Cup in Perth on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Pace won six of the seven races he sailed to enjoy a good day
while Peter Gilmour and his Japanese Pizza LA team and for Peter
Holmberg's Starsail team suffered a tough day.
</P>
<P>
Gilmour, who is second on the scoreboard, and fourth-placed
Holmberg were involved in a collision that left a gash in the side
of the Japanese team's boat.
</P>
<P>
Gilmour was penalised for the incident on the water, and
consequently lost the race, but in a protest hearing later the
jury ruled that the cost of the damage should be split between the
two competitors.
</P>
<P>
Close races were seen between two "young guns" of the series,
New Zealander Dean Barker and Australia's James Spithill, finished
in a dead heat.
</P>
<P>
The result put Barker and his Team New Zealand crew from the
successful America's Cup defense team in third place overnight,
just half a point behind Gilmour.
</P>
<P>
The battle for the fourth place in the semifinals is shaping up
to be close, with three teams on seven wins -- Holmberg, from the
U.S. Virgin Islands, Swede Bjorn Hansen and local skipper Gordon
Lucas.
</P>
<P>
The event is the second of eight on the Swedish Match Tour and
is scheduled to finish on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> ISU Say No to Professionals Return to Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICE, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The International Skating Union (ISU)
Thursday slammed the door firmly to those professionals who wish
for a return to the Olympic competition.
</P>
<P>
ISU president Ottavio Cinquanta said at a news conference
during the world figure skating championships that skaters, who
had turned their back on the ISU to perform in lucrative ice shows
or on the professional circuit, would never be welcomed back.
</P>
<P>
"There is no return, 100 percent," declared Cinquanta. "Never,
ever, until these individuals can explain to me why they left the
ISU."
</P>
<P>
Before the Lillehammer Games, the ISU offered an amnesty for
skaters wanting to return to the fold.
</P>
<P>
But after Cinquanta's remarks on Thursday, a similar plan for
the 2002 Salt Lake Olympics looks out of the question.

<HEADLINE> China's Giant Pandas Waiting to Be Adopted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- According to an agreement signed
today between the China Wildlife Conservation Association (CWCA)
and the twinbays.com, an America-based e-commerce website, China
will start from April 1 to raise funds on line to protect giant
pandas,
</P>
<P>
Five giant pandas from the Wolong Nature Reserve in southwest
China's Sichuan Province will be adopted under the fund-raising
program, said CWCA secretary-general Wang Fuxing.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first time that China goes on line to raise
funds for the protection of wildlife, he said.
</P>
<P>
Information about the five pandas will be found at the English
website twinbays.com. The website was built last year by several
Chinese studying in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Liao Yan, general manager of the website, said that any
American companies, organizations or individuals can donate money
or adopt the pandas via the website.
</P>
<P>
Liao said that the American people were terribly saddened when
Hsing-Hsing, a giant panda sent by China as a gift to the
Washington Zoo, died last year.
</P>
<P>
The web company will set up a "Giant Panda Project Panel",
which will be responsible for approving applicants who want to
adopt the giant pandas. CWCA will be fully responsible for
managing the donation funds.
</P>
<P>
Funds will be mainly used to facilitate research programs on
the giant panda and also improve conditions at the Wolong Nature
Reserve. The reserve is home to 41 giant pandas. Newly-born panda
cubs increase by seven to eight a year.
</P>
<P>
Those who adopt giant pandas will for one year be allowed to
choose a name for their adopted giant panda. They will also cover
all cost in looking after their giant pandas.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, information on the living
conditions of the pandas will be provided by the twinbays.com.
</P>
<P>
In February this year, the website had exclusive rights to show
the Spring Festival Evening Gala in the North America. The website
attracted some 400,000 to 500,000 people.

<HEADLINE> Internet Switch Center Opens in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The first Internet Switch Center
opened in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Internet service users have always complained about the
slow speed of networks, they call Worldwide Web, Worldwide Wait.
</P>
<P>
Wu Jichuan, Chinese minister of Information Industry, said
switching centers in cities not only will meet the demands of
domestic Internet portals, but will also facilitate Internet
expansion.
</P>
<P>
"Internet Switch Center is a cost-effective, quick and
efficient solution which will have far-reaching implications for
developing China's Internet," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
China has opened five commercial and four non-commercial
networks, including the ChinaNet, UniNet, ChinaGBN, CNCNet, CSTNet,
CGWNet, CNCNet, CMNet, CGWNet, and CIETNet.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the number of Chinese Internet service
subscribers rose to 8.9 million, with more than 520 licensed
Internet service providers. However, the sharp increase of
Internet users has resulted in "traffic jam" on the super
information highway.
</P>
<P>
Wu said other switch centers will soon emerge across the
country, and the brand width of China's networks will be expanded
to 1500 Mb/s by the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> HK Appoints New Term Membership of HKCPEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region government Thursday announced the
appointment of the new term membership of the Hong Kong Committee
for Pacific Economic Cooperation for two years, effective from
April 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Established in March 1990, the committee comprises business
leaders, academics and government officials, who advise the
Government on matters related to Hong Kong's participation in the
Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC).
</P>
<P>
The PECC, which is also tripartite in nature, serves as an
independent forum for discussing trade and economic issues, and
fostering closer economic cooperation in the Pacific region. The
committee assumed the chairmanship of PECC in October 1999 for a
two-year term.
</P>
<P>
"To enable the committee to discharge effectively its
responsibilities as the PECC chair, we have strengthened its
membership so that the committee is better placed to support and
steer the PECC's work in the coming two years," a government
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The expanded membership embraces more academics and businessmen,
especially those with expertise in the areas which the committee
has chosen as the themes and priorities of its chairmanship,
information technology, trade and finance, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The number of the committee's members in the new term will thus
increase from 26 to 33, comprising 12 academics, 11 businessmen
and 10 government members.
</P>
<P>
William Fung, group managing director of Li and Fung Limited,
has been re-appointed as chairman of the committee. He will also
serve as the international PECC Chair till end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
"We are very grateful to Fung for his invaluable contribution
to the committee in the past few years, and to his agreement to
continue to serve as chairman of the committee despite his other
heavy commitments. We are confident that, under his capable
leadership, the committee will be able to contribute
constructively to regional economic cooperation," the spokesman
added.
</P>
<P>
Of the rest of the members, 10 are newly appointed, 22 are re-
appointed. The PECC has 24 member committees representing the 24
different economies around the world. France (Pacific Territories)
joined as an associate member in April 1997.
</P>
<P>
It also has two institutional members, which are the Pacific
Trade and Development Conference and Pacific Basin Economic
Council.

<HEADLINE> Use of Tiger Parts to Cure Disease Endangering Tigers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The tradition to make medicine
with tiger parts including the bones remains a leading threat to
tigers, according to a report released Thursday by TRAFFIC, a wild
animal protection organization.
</P>
<P>
The trade in tiger skins and curios is also threatening the
existence of the big cats, with a population of no more than 8,000
across the world.
</P>
<P>
Tiger-bone medicines and tonics have been used as a treatment
for rheumatism and related ailments for thousands of years in Asia
and people will try to obtain them, even at some risk, said the
report by the Trade Records Analysis of Flora and Fauna in
Commerce (TRAFFIC).
</P>
<P>
The report, titled Far From A Cure: The Tiger Trade Revisited,
warned that the fight to save the tiger risks being lost if
conservationists become complacent with the advances made in the
1990s towards reducing use of tiger bone in traditional Asian
medicine.
</P>
<P>
If medicinal trade is able to survive underground, which is
difficult to detect by conventional market survey techniques in
consuming markets, it will provide an incentive for commercial
poaching of tigers, increasing the risk of extinction for the
vulnerable wild populations, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In the future, it will be more efficient to prevent illegal
tiger trade by increasing law enforcement and trade monitoring
capacity at the source of supply, in rural areas near tiger
populations, it said.
</P>
<P>
TRAFFIC is a joint program of the World Wide Fund for Nature
and the World Conservation Union.

<HEADLINE> HK Chief Executive Urges Press to Strive for Excellence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa
said Thursday that he shared the expectation of the community for
the press to enhance the quality of news reporting, supporting the
newspaper profession in striving for excellence to secure wider
public approval.
</P>
<P>
Addressing Thursday's presentation ceremony of 1999 Press
Awards organized by the Newspaper Society of Hong Kong, Tung
stressed that newspapers represented a public institution with a
social responsibility.
</P>
<P>
He earnestly hopes that the press would improve professional
ethics and pursue self-regulation to meet the expectations of the
public.
</P>
<P>
"Our society is highly tolerant. The stories covered by our
newspapers are diverse in terms of subjects and content," Tung
said.
</P>
<P>
It is natural for newspapers to secure wider popularity in
order to improve their circulation. However, in the long run, the
press can only meet the high expectations of the community by
striving for excellence and quality, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Newspapers exercise very considerable influence. It is natural
for the readership to expect newspapers to make a positive
contribution to the values and standards in our community," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Citing the winning entries of the Awards as examples, Tung said
the outstanding photographs were much appreciated by the readers,
and were distinct from pictures which had to be encoded or blurred
in part for publication.
</P>
<P>
The selection and appreciation of these outstanding entries
certainly reflect a degree of value judgment, Tung said. "In our
society, there exists a set of mainstream values to distinguish
what is genuine, good and beautiful from what is ingenuine,
distasteful and shameful," he said
</P>
<P>
"While Hong Kong society is highly open and tolerant, we have
basic values which characterize our way of thinking, moral
sentiments, behavior and tastes," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is part of China and the majority of our residents
are Chinese. Our society has naturally inherited the essence of
the Chinese culture, but at the same time has absorbed new ideas
and cultural influences from the rest of the world. However,
certain ethical values and norms are common to all civilizations,
Chinese and Western alike," he added.
</P>
<P>
As from the standpoint of public acceptance, he said media
should recognize that the community had expressed concerns about
some of the practices of the press.
</P>
<P>
These included reports which were irresponsible and distorted,
coverage which harmed the interest of persons being reported on,
without regard to the circumstances which victims faced nor their
privacy, and excessive displays of sex and violence.
</P>
<P>
Although such practices are not prevalent in most newspapers,
they are sufficient to arouse concern in the community.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the proposals for self-regulation of the media,
Tung said: "I earnestly hope that the press will strengthen its
professional ethics, pursue self-regulation and meet the
expectations of the public."
</P>
<P>
He said the public and the government are very concerned about
pornographic articles disseminated through the media which
profaned the morals of young people.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the government attached much importance to the
control of pornographic publications and had the commitment to
address the issue.
</P>
<P>
"The younger generation represents Hong Kong's future. We have
the responsibility to create a healthy environment for their
development. This is not solely the responsibility of the press.
We need the concerted efforts of parents, teachers and the entire
community."
</P>
<P>
"With our joint commitment, and through developing Hong Kong
into a major city of China as well as a leading world city of Asia,
we will be able to establish a society which is rich in culture
and which can offer the people of Hong Kong a more fulfilling life,
" Tung concluded.

<HEADLINE> Strike Paralyzes 25 Pct Transport in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Thursday evening that only 25 percent of the transport was
paralyzed by a nationwide transport strike staged by the country's
jeepney drivers to protest the fuel price hike and road users' tax.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the Department of Transportation and
Communications (DOTC) said that paralyzed were routes operated by
the Pinagisang Samahan ng mg Tsuper at Opereytor Nationwide (
PISTON), organizer of Thursday's nationwide strike.
</P>
<P>
The DOTC said the transport strike was not as successful in
Metro Manila as in the provinces in Cebu, Davao, Bacolod, General
Santos, Pampanga and others.
</P>
<P>
Nicanor Bartolome, spokesman for the Philippine National Police,
said militant groups failed in their bid to paralyze the transport
industry nationwide as planned by the PISTON.
</P>
<P>
He said that except for some areas in Metro Manila and some
parts of the country, traffic was "normal" as many jeepney drivers
defied the call by the PISTON to join the strike.
</P>
<P>
Bartolome said there were only few reports of harassment by
militant groups on jeepney drivers who continued to ply their
routes.
</P>
<P>
Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board Chairman
Dante Lantin said some 525 buses were deployed in different areas
to ferry stranded passengers. Also deployed were government and
military vehicles.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, bus terminals were secured for whatever
incidents that might happen.

<HEADLINE> Police Seize Virus Vials on Plane in Sydney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Australian Federal Police (AFP)
have seized three vials containing a virus which were found
abandoned on a plane at the Sydney International Airport, an AFP
spokeswoman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cleaners Wednesday discovered the sealed vials in the toilet of
a Qantas 747 jet, after it arrived from Frankfurt, Germany.
</P>
<P>
The attempt to smuggle the coxsackie virus, which would cause a
respiratory or throat infection if inhaled, comes just six months
before the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokeswoman said it was unlikely the matter would
be treated as a potential biological terrorist threat.
</P>
<P>
She denied reports that the AFP had launched a national
investigation into the incident.
</P>
<P>
"We have taken possession of the vials to have the contents
analyzed," the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
She did not know how long the testing would take.
</P>
<P>
Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service spokesman Carson
Creagh said the discovery was quite rare, although people often
left things on planes because they did not want to risk breaking
quarantine laws.
</P>
<P>
"It is quite uncommon, (finding) material of this nature is
extremely uncommon," Creagh said.

<HEADLINE> Tourist Arrivals to Cambodia Increase in First Two Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Tourist arrivals to Cambodia
rose year-on-year by 53 percent to 60,878 in the first two months
of this year, according to figures of the Tourism Ministry
available Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The figures showed that the number of arrivals in January was
28,126, a 38 percent increase over a year earlier. And in February,
the arrivals rose by 69 percent to 32,752, as against 19,354 in
the same month of last year.
</P>
<P>
The arrivals from the United States and Japan were the highest
in number. France and China came third and fourth respectively.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the sharp increase in tourist arrivals
to "improved security and political stability," and the government
's "Open Skies" policy that allows foreign airlines to fly
directly to Siem Reap.
</P>
<P>
The number of tourists coming to Cambodia last year climbed 30
percent, and tourism officials expected a similar increase this
year.

<HEADLINE> hke033067-- Philippine Court Drops Mauling Case vs. U.S. Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A trial court judge in the
southern Philippine city of Cebu ordered Thursday the dismissal of
the mauling case lodged against three U.S. servicemen after the
victim, a taxi driver, told the court he has forgiven them.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here, Marcelo Batestil told
Municipal Trial Court Judge Rosabella Tormis in open court that he
has forgiven the U.S. servicemen -- Michael Keyes, John Earl
Lowery and Shannon Towers.
</P>
<P>
Judge Tormis immediately ordered the dismissal of the serious
physical injuries case Batestil had filed against the three.
</P>
<P>
Batestil, however, demanded that the three issue a public
apology over the incident. Keyes and Lowery, who appeared before
the court Thursday, issued handwritten apologies to Batestil.
</P>
<P>
The three U.S. servicemen were crew members of a U.S. warship
which recently visited Cebu for rest and recreation. The three
mauled Batestil after he demanded a taxi fare of 800 pesos (20 U.S.
dollar) for his service of driving them to tourist spots.
</P>
<P>
The mauling case was viewed by many as a test of the
Philippines-U.S. Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) and the
Philippines' strength in asserting jurisdiction in the trial of U.
S. troops charged with crimes committed while on Philippine soil.
</P>
<P>
The VFA, which allows the two countries to resume large-scale
joint military exercises, states that American troops who commit
crimes while off duty are subject to Philippine legal jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement, Batestil said the case has proven that
the Philippine government has asserted its jurisdiction to try the
criminal case against the three U.S. servicemen because they have
appeared before the court.

<HEADLINE> 40 Killed in Plane Crash in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-six Sri Lankan soldiers
and four crew members were killed Thursday when a military plane
they were aboard crashed in the north of the country, the state
radio said.
</P>
<P>
The bodies were recovered near a military air field at
Anuradhapura, some 200 km north of Colombo, the radio in its night
broadcast.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Defense said the Russian-built Antonov-26 plane,
flying from Palaly in the northernmost Jaffna peninsula to
Anuradhapura, crashed due to a technical fault.
</P>
<P>
The plane was chartered by the air force to transport troops
including soldiers wounded in recent fighting with Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels, who demand a homeland for
minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports said the crew had informed the Sri Lanka
air force flight control tower at Palaly in the northernmost
Jaffna that it had developed engine trouble 10 minutes before the
crash.
</P>
<P>
The latest crash is Sri Lanka's second one involving an Antonov
plane in a week.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday an Antonov-12 cargo plane crashed near the
international airport in suburban Colombo, killing six crew
members and four villagers on the ground.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Sri Lanka's civil aviation authorities have
grounded Antonov aircraft operated by local cargo carriers pending
an investigation assisted by Russian experts.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Committed to Equal Income Distribution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Finance Minister Trevor
Manuel said here on Thursday that he will try to ensure that the
budget be used as a tool to guarantee an equal income distribution
in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
He told the South African Human Sciences Research Council that
income distribution in the country "is now the most unequal in the
world".
</P>
<P>
A recent study on income distribution by an economic
consultancy showed that the inequality in the country widened
between the rich and poor.
</P>
<P>
The poorest 40 percent of black households saw their income
dwindle by 20 percent between 1991 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
The statistics, Manuel said, mean that South Africa must
urgently reduce the inequalities "or we will fail to deliver
democracy to our people."
</P>
<P>
"Inequality remains. It didn't disappear on April 27, 1994," he
said, referring to the date of South Africa's first democratic
election.
</P>
<P>
"My biggest challenge is to ensure that the budget is used as
an exceedingly important tool of redistribution, and that it does
deliver what it's meant to."
</P>
<P>
One of the keys to redistribution of wealth is black economic
empowerment, he said, adding that social spending needs to be high
on the list of priorities, especially education.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Arresting a record 2,231 suspected narcotics traffickers,
law enforcement agencies from the United States and other Western
Hemisphere nations have completed a massive bust they hope will at
least temporarily restrict the flow of illegal narcotics from the
Caribbean to Central and South America, officials announced
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth said Wednesday that
President Bill Clinton and top White House officials committed a
crime in 1998 when they released letters written to the president
by Kathleen E. Willey, who had accused him of fondling her.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Hours after Iran angrily broke ranks with the other OPEC
members meeting in Vienna, its leaders reversed themselves and
announced that they would try to raise production in line with the
rest of the oil-producing nations.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. House approved Wednesday night 4 billion U.S.
dollars in additional Pentagon spending for this year, as
lawmakers edged closer to approving a 12.6-billion-dollar overall
package that would also help Colombia combat drug trafficking and
pay for military operations in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The attention at this week's OPEC meeting was focused on
increasing oil production and trying to bring Iran in line with
other members. But in their closed-door meetings, OPEC oil
ministers also quietly took steps to exert unprecedented control
over world prices and keep them at relatively high levels.
</P>
<P>
-- A federal judge on Wednesday ordered a unit of UST Inc., the
United States' largest maker of chewing tobacco, to pay 1.05
billion U.S. dollars in damages to Conwood Co. after a jury found
that the company had violated antitrust laws.

<HEADLINE> France Calls for Resumption of Talks Between Israel, Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 30 (Xinhua) -- France called for Israel and Syria
to end a standoff Thursday after U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad failed to arrange a resumption of
the Israel-Syria peace talks during their summit last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"It is essential that mutual efforts be made by the two sides
for a resumption of talks in the perspective of establishing a
lasting peace," said French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne
Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said that diplomatic efforts should not be
abandoned in seeking a resumption of the talks despite the
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and French Foreign
Minister Hubert Vedrine said in a telephone conversation this week
that the United States and France would continue to persuade
Israel and Syria to return to the negotiation table.
</P>
<P>
France has also expressed its wish that an Israeli withdrawal
from South Lebanon, scheduled to be completed by July, be
implemented under a comprehensive peace deal with Syria and
Lebanon, and not as a unilateral move.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has pressed al-Assad by asking him twice in the three-
day talks to agree on a resumption of talks with Israel.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The league-leading Los Angeles
Lakers increased their latest winning streak to seven games with a
108-99 road victory Wednesday over the lowly Grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
Kobe Bryant scored 28 points and Shaquille O'Neal chipped in 19
points for the Lakers, who pulled away by outscoring Vancouver 29-
16 in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
Lakers improved to 60-12 with their 26th win in their last 27
games.
</P>
<P>
Michael Dickerson scored 32 points and Shareef Abdur Rahim
added 30 points and 13 rebounds for the Grizzlies, which lost 14
of their last 15 games.
</P>
<P>
In Salt Lake, Philadelphia had its season-high seven-game
winning streak ended as they bowed to the Utah Jazz 84-98, failing
to change their winless record in Utah since November 30, 1987.
</P>
<P>
Karl Malone scored 30 points and John Stockton added 20 to lead
Utah to the 14th win in their last 16 games.
</P>
<P>
Toni Kukoc and Allen Iverson scored 18 points apiece for
Philadelphia, which remained two games ahead of fifth-place
Toronto in the Eastern Conference but fell 2-1/2 behind Miami in
the race for first in the Atlantic Division.
</P>
<P>
In Seattle, Allan Houston scored 19 to lead six Knicks in
double figures as the New York Knicks routed the Supersonics 110-

At Detroit, Charlotte Hornets downed the Pistons 98-91, posting
their fourth successive win to move within one game of fifth-place
Toronto in the scramble for Eastern Conference playoff positions.

Detroit is 2 1/2 games back of Charlotte and just one in front

</P>
<P>
In Washington, Denver posted a 101-93 win over the Wizards but
it was a cold comfort as the Nuggets had been eliminated from

<HEADLINE> Keegan: Le Saux Doubtful for Euro 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 30 (Xinhua) -- England manager Kevin Keegan said
on Thursday that Chelsea guard Graeme Le Saux is unlikely to take
part in Euro 2000 after being out since October with an ankle
injury.
</P>
<P>
"Graeme is looking a major doubt," Keegan said."He's not had
too much luck this season."
</P>
<P>
But Le Saux could still hope to be involved in the qualifiers
for the 2002 World Cup and international friendlies next season,
Keegan was quoted by the Evening Standard newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
The manager also said that he wanted to take West Ham's teenage
midfielder Joe Cole to Euro 2000, but not as a full squad member.
</P>
<P>
Cole did not play in England's under-21 win against Yugoslavia

<HEADLINE> ISU President Speaks Highly of Chinese Figure Skating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICE, March 30 (Xinhua) -- International Skating Union (ISU)
president Ottavio Cinquanta gave thumbs-up here on Thursday to the
development of figure skating in China, thinking it has played a
very important part in the world arena.
</P>
<P>
"In the last couple of years, Chinese figure skaters have won
several honors in different major competitions, I think this is
really very great. It is not only good for China, but also for the
world," he said.
</P>
<P>
The sport of figure skating has for long been a territory of
Europe and North America, but in recent years, the balance of the
scale began to make some changes.
</P>
<P>
At the 1995 world championships in Birmingham, England, Chen Lu
from China stepped up onto the highest podium of the women's event.
The girl from China's Changchun city also finished third at the
Nagano Winter Olympic Games in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Also on the rise is the level of the Chinese pairs skaters who
finished last at the 1980 world championships where Luan Bo and
his partner Yao Bin made a Chinese debut.
</P>
<P>
But 20 years later, also at the world championships, Shen Xue/
Zhao Hongbo, coached by Yao Bin, finished second. Apart from that,
the Chinese duo also won the gold medals at the Grand Prix finals
in 1999 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
However, Cinquanta also pointed out that Chinese skaters,
especially the men's, need to improve their presentation in
competition should they upgrade the levels.
</P>
<P>
"China has very good men's skaters, they can jump, they can
spin, they can skate, but they should smile. When you smile, you
get good impressions from the judges. When the difficulties are
the same, what has the final say in the rankings? Presentation,"
he added.

<P>
LONDON, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The plan for American heavyweight
boxer Mike Tyson to fight in Glasgow has been scrapped after a
date failed to be worked out.
</P>
<P>
Promoters has scheduled the fight for sometime in July at Ibrox,
home of Glasgow Rangers soccer club.
</P>
<P>
But Rangers secretary Campbell Ogilvie said the club's soccer
commitments meant the plans had to be ruled out.
</P>
<P>
"The Scottish Premier League starts on July 29 and there could
be a European tie before that and even a friendly at the ground
before that, so the window is a very small one," said Ogilvie.
</P>
<P>
On January 29, Tyson knocked out Britain's Julius Francis at
the MEN Arena in Manchester, England. Tyson returns to Europe next
month to fight Lou Saverse in Milan, Italy, on May 20.
</P>
<P>
Promoters are still looking at "eight or 10" possible venues
across Europe for a Tyson fight this summer.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Archaeologists today found wooden
walls of a 2,000-year-old tomb.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of the wooden walls reveals that the tomb
belonged to a king in the Western Han Dynasty (206 BC to 24 AD).
</P>
<P>
The walls of the tomb are intact. Archaeologists believe that
the tomb has never been looted and must contain many invaluable
items.

<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Standard Life, a top life insurer
in Europe, has expressed its optimism on ongoing talks between
China and the European Union on China's accession to the World
Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued today by the company's Beijing
representative office, the company's managing director, Scott Bell
said he believes that the two sides will reach an agreement on
China's WTO membership.

In the long term, China's accession to the WTO will not only be
good for China's development, but also for its trading partners as
well, said Bell.
</P>
<P>
Bell said that judging from China's rapid development over
recent years, there is good reason to believe that Chinese
enterprises have the ability to cope with challenges brought by
the country's accession to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
He also said that after China's entry into the WTO, China will
reduce restrictions on the entrance of foreign insurance firms
into its market, which is good news for European insurers.

BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said today that it is in the fundamental interests of the peoples
of China and the United States to maintain and develop healthy and
stable bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
This is conducive to peace, stability and development of the
Asian-Pacific region and the whole world as well, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
He made these remarks in a meeting with Samuel Berger, adviser
to the U.S. president for national security affairs. Berger first
conveyed regards from US President Bill Clinton to Jiang. Jiang
welcomed Berger to China and asked him to convey his regards to
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said Sino-U.S. relations are presently facing both
opportunities and challenges, adding, "For the fundamental
interests of the Chinese and American people and everyone else, we
should build healthy Sino-U.S. relations and make concerted
efforts to achieve this goal in the new century."
</P>
<P>
He called on both the Chinese and U.S. governments and leaders
to be far-sighted and be aware that there exists important common

The Chinese president also noted that differences between the
two countries should be handled properly on the basis of three
Sino-U.S. joint communiques, especially the Taiwan issue, so as to
safeguard the foundation of Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
"Only in this way can Sino-U.S. relations enjoy a healthy,
steady and sustained development in the new century," Jiang
stressed.
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan issue, Jiang said that the "one China" principle
is the basis and prerequisite for a peaceful solution of the
Taiwan issue and that any form of "Taiwan independence" will not
be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the change of leadership in Taiwan does not
change the fact that Taiwan is part of the Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
Whoever is in power in Taiwan is welcome to come to the
mainland for talks, Jiang said, adding that "we can also go to
Taiwan as well."
</P>
<P>
However, there must be a basis for dialogue, he said, adding
that the "one China" principle must be strictly adhered to. "We
will not compromise or make any concessions on the fundamental
issue concerning China's sovereignty and territorial integrity,"
Jiang said, stressing that issues concerning sovereignty cannot be
negotiated.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and people are determined not to allow
Taiwan to be separated from the motherland, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"We have the confidence and capabilities to realize the
complete reunification of the motherland," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan issue is purely an internal issue of China, Jiang
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the United States has to bear some
responsibilities for the fact that the Taiwan issue has not been
resolved. The Taiwan issue has become a core issue in Sino-U.S.
relations.

on which the Taiwan question can be resolved.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President stressed that the three Sino-U.S. joint

</P>
<P>
The U.S. should take practical actions to carry out its "one

<HEADLINE> Israel's Scientists Find Weapon Against "Flesh- eating" Germs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Israel's scientists have
developed the first medical weapon in the world to fight against
the virulent strains of staphylococcal and streptococcal bacteria,
commonly known as "flesh-eating" germs.
</P>
<P>
A research team led by Professor Raymond Kaempfer of Hadassah
Faculty of Medicine in Israel's Hebrew University made this
breakthrough after four-year-long hard work, sources in the
university said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Their research will appear in the April 1 issue of the
scientific journal Nature Medicine, which will possibly lead to a
practical treatment against such germs.
</P>
<P>
Flesh-eating bacteria can cause victims' system failures by
toxic shock and kill them within a day or even a matter of hours,
leaving no time for doctors to treat the infection.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, toxin-producing bacteria often resist antibiotics,
which is the reason why there is no satisfactory treatment against
such lethal germs at present.
</P>
<P>
There are usually several hundred cases of toxic shock in
Israel each year, with 15 percent to 25 percent of victims dying
and others losing limbs, which was consumed by the spreading toxins
secreted by flesh-eating bacteria.
</P>
<P>
The Hadassah research team designed a synthetic peptide
molecule, which could block successfully the producing of toxins by
the bacteria in massive numbers.
</P>
<P>
The test on models of human blood and laboratory mice had proved
the molecule's effectiveness with a 100 percent success record. The
researchers will begin their experiments on human subjects within a
year.
</P>
<P>
Then they will refine the synthetic molecule to further enhance
its efficacy, in the hope of developing new drugs to save hundreds
of thousands of people worldwide from limb amputations and death
each year.

<HEADLINE> Australia Launches Workplace Internet Privacy Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government
Thursday launched new guidelines to protect the privacy of workers
who send personal e-mails or browse the Internet on office
computers.
</P>
<P>
The Guidelines on Workplace E-mail, Web Browsing and Privacy
aim to protect workers' rights while acknowledging that many
employers monitor activities carried out on company equipment for
business or security reasons.
</P>
<P>
The launch comes amid federal government moves to tighten
privacy legislation and calls by unions and civil libertarians for
safeguards against privacy violations and sackings on the basis of
intercepted E-mail.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launch, Australia's Attorney-General Daryl
Williams said a recent survey by law firm Freehills found 76
percent of organizations polled periodically monitored E-mail.
</P>
<P>
However, only 35 percent informed customers or staff about it.
</P>
<P>
Williams said the new guidelines stressed the need for
organizations to devise clear E-mail and web browsing policies and
make sure their employees were informed of them.
</P>
<P>
"What is needed is a clear set of rules that strikes a balance
between individual privacy, freedom of information and the needs
of business," he said.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines also emphasize the importance of sound privacy
practice for an organization's productivity and worker moral.
</P>
<P>
Federal government's Privacy Commissioner Malcolm Crompton said
problems in the workplace could be minimized if people knew where
they stood with regards to the use of the Internet and E-mail.
</P>
<P>
"It's important that employers are open and clear about their
office E-mail and Internet usage policy," Crompton said.
</P>
<P>
"Technology doesn't have to be pitted against privacy," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Employment Rises by 3.8 Pct in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Thursday that employment in the country improved by 3.8 percent or
1.069 million, increasing the number of employed people nationwide
to 28.980 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Labor and Employment Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma said the
increase offset jobs losses resulting from the Asian financial
crisis and boosted economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Laguesma noted that seven regions in Luzon accounted for 45.6
percent of the 1.069 million gain, while six regions in Mindanao,
and three in the Visayas, registered 32.6 percent and 21.8 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Statistics Office (NSO), the
nationwide employment rate increased to 90.3 percent of the total
labor force of 32.08 million in 1999, while the unemployment rate
decreased to 9.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The NSO indicated that countryside jobs, mainly agricultural,
accounted for about two-thirds, or 681,000 of the total gains in
1999, while urban jobs made up the remaining 388,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
The new jobs brought the number of employed people in the rural

<HEADLINE> Australia Launches Educational Kit to Tackle Mental Health Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government
Thursday moved to tackle the growing issue of mental health by
launching an educational kit for schools.
</P>
<P>
One in five Australian adults has a mental illness and almost
20 percent of all children and adolescents in Australia have
experienced mental health problems, federal Health Minister
Richard Wooldridge said.
</P>
<P>
Depression is the most common of these problems, with up to 24
percent of the children experiencing it by the age of 18.
</P>
<P>
"Depression makes young people vulnerable to mental health
problems later in life and puts them at greater risk of suicide
and self-harm," the Mind Matters kit said.
</P>
<P>
Students with mental health problems also are five times more
likely to have below-age academic competence compared with
students who do not have the problems.
</P>
<P>
Wooldridge said Mind Matters kit was a teaching resource
designed to help teachers promote a healthy school environment.
</P>
<P>
"Mind Matters is about building resilience to mentally ill
health in our classrooms," he said.
</P>
<P>
The kit includes resources to map and manage mental health in
schools and a guide for school-based responses to preventing self-
harm and suicide.
</P>
<P>
The project was successfully piloted in 24 Australian schools
in 1998 and 1999.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Oil Companies Complain About Higher Taxes on Fuel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian oil marketing
companies complained that the government levies and taxes were
behind the unpredictable increase in prices of petroleum products,
 newspapers said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
All the taxes are "approximately 150 percent above the landed
price of each particular petroleum product," the companies said in
a statement, adding: "The government is no doubt the biggest
contributor to the high price of fuel."
</P>
<P>
The fuel prices in Tanzanian pump stations on Monday rose to a
historic high level, inflicting a heavy blow to local consumers.
</P>
<P>
The prices of super petrol and diesel were raised by 20
Tanzanian shillings (one U.S. dollar equals 802 Tanzanian
shillings) to 565 and 518 shillings per liter respectively.
</P>
<P>
This increase, the ninth over the past few months, followed a
hike of 20 shillings per liter for petrol and three shillings for
diesel last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Ministry of Energy and Minerals blamed the
unstable prices on world oil market for the frequent price
increases of petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
"The prices of fuel at the world market could change within a
time frame of three days," Commissioner for Energy and Petroleum
Affairs Bashir Mrindoko said early this week.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian transporters warned the high fuel prices could
paralyze the sector unless the government check the trend.
</P>
<P>
Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Finance Peter Ngumbullu
said at the weekend that the treasury was going to review
petroleum products price structure to ensure that fuel is sold to
consumers at realistic and affordable prices.

PARIS, March 30 (Xinhua) -- France expressed its concern
Thursday about the revival of violence in Haiti and called on the
Caribbean island nation to set the date for municipal and
legislative elections as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"France is concerned about the brutal degradation of the social
and political climate in Haiti, the consequence of a long crisis
in which the country has been involved since June 1997," said
French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she said the French government regrets the delay in
the electoral process in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
"France hopes the dates for the legislative and local elections,
which should be held as soon as possible, be set without delay.
Elections held under democratic, fair and transparent conditions
could help solve this crisis," said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
She said the violent incidents that have taken place over the
past several days in Haiti, especially in the capital of Port-au-
Prince, have caused confusion and disturbed election preparations.
</P>
<P>
A Haitian opposition leader and his wife were shot dead by
unknown gunmen on Tuesday, while violent demonstrators protested
this week at the delay of elections by the Provisionary Electoral
Council and the soaring coast of living.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has also urged Haiti
to hold elections as soon as possible.

</P>
<P>
The private university is sponsored by a host of celebrities in

<HEADLINE> HK Publishes Free E-Commerce CD-ROMs for Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong residents will obtain
a free CD-ROM with information and interactive demonstrations on e-
commerce produced in Chinese at government offices from Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The CD-ROMs are produced by the Information Technology Services
Department to enhance the public's knowledge of e-commerce and to
encourage their application of e-commerce in daily lives.
</P>
<P>
As the CD-ROM is designed with a self-learning mode, members of
the public can familiarize themselves with basic computer
operation and interface application before learning the
application of e-commerce by viewing the CD-ROM at any time and
any place convenient to them.
</P>
<P>
E-commerce generally refers to commercial activities conducted
through electronic means such as the Internet, interactive
televisions and public information kiosks.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the traditional mode of trade, e-commerce
delivers quicker and more convenient services, requires lower
operating cost and is not subjected to time and geographical
constraints.
</P>
<P>
The e-commerce CD-ROM comprises two parts - the video compact
disc (VCD) section and the interactive section.
</P>
<P>
The VCD section contains basic information on e-commerce
including electronic tools, the Internet world, Electronic Service
Delivery scheme, on-line shops, basic steps to get on-line and
security measures for on-line trade.
</P>
<P>
The interactive section demonstrates the application of
business-to-consumer and business-to-business types of e-commerce
such as on-line services provided by real estate agents, banks and
supermarkets, and on-line tendering systems.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong government has been committed to promoting e-
commerce to help retain Hong Kong's competitive edge and to drive
its overall economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
There were about 1.5 million Internet users in Hong Kong and
the use of the Internet in Hong Kong in 1999, calculated in the
time spent on the dial-up network, doubled that in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The total amount of trade of goods and services in Hong Kong
conducted over the Internet was predicted to rise to 2.4 billion U.
S. dollars by 2003 from 60 million U.S. dollars in 1998.

BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The 36 companies nationwide
authorized to carry out international tendering business in China
received certificates of qualifications today.
</P>
<P>
A total of 31 tendering companies were today granted Grade A
certificates and five granted Grade B certificates by China's
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
A-grade organizations are authorized to call for tenders when
purchasing electric equipment and machinery with both overseas and
domestic loans, while the B-grade can call for tenders when
purchasing electric equipment and machinery with domestic loans
only.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the authorization system will further
regulate China's bidding system.
</P>
<P>
China began its international tendering for electric equipment
and machinery in the early 1980s, and has developed fast since.
The number of tendering organizations rose from 6 at the start to
the current 36, and the source of capital is no longer restricted
to overseas capital, while the tendering volume has risen to
several billion US dollars per year compared with only tens of
millions two decades ago.

Jiang said that the change of leadership in Taiwan does not
change the fact that Taiwan is part of the Chinese territory.

Whoever is in power in Taiwan is welcome to come to the
mainland for talks, Jiang said, adding that "we can also go to
Taiwan as well."

will not compromise or make any concessions on the fundamental
issue concerning China's sovereignty and territorial integrity,"
Jiang said, stressing that issues concerning sovereignty cannot be

BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said today that it is in the fundamental interest of the peoples
of China and the United States to maintain and develop healthy and
stable bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
This is conducive to the peace, stability and development of
the Asian-Pacific region and the whole world as well, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
He made these remarks in a meeting with Samuel Berger, adviser

Jiang said Sino-U.S. relations are presently facing both
opportunities and challenges, adding, "For the fundamental
interest of the Chinese and American people and everyone else, we
should build healthy Sino-U.S. relations and make concerted
efforts to achieve this goal in the new century."
</P>
<P>
He called on both the Chinese and U.S. governments and leaders
to be far-sighted and be aware that there exists important common
interest between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president also noted that differences between the
two countries should be handled properly on the basis of three
Sino-U.S. Joint Communiques, especially the Taiwan issue, so as to
safeguard the foundation of Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
"Only in this way can Sino-U.S. relations enjoy a healthy,
steady and sustained development in the new century," Jiang
stressed.
</P>

Berger has come to China to promote the establishment of a
constructive strategic partnership between the U.S. and China, an
objective which has been set by the two presidents.

CAIRO, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- Saudi Arabia decided to organize an exhibition of
Saudi products in Tokyo, Japan, on June 8-12, the Saudi daily Al-
Riyadh reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the Saudi non-oil export to Japan rose from 3.2
million U.S. dollars in 1993 to 8 million dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi ministry of industry and electricity will coordinate
with the export development agencies at the Saudi council of
chambers, and with Saudi companies and factories to participate in
the exhibition for introducing Saudi products to the world market.
</P>
<P>
ALGIERS -- Algeria's central bank said the country's export
volume rose by 27 percent in 1999 to 11.9 billion dollars, as
compared with 9.4 billion dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian economic daily Al Alam El-Yom on Thursday quoted
the central bank as saying the rise is attributed to the recovery
in world oil prices, noting that oil and gas account for over 98
percent of all Algerian exports.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The Poland-Turkey Free Trade Agreement, signed in
Ankara on October 4, 1999, have been ratified by the two
governments, reported Turkish Daily News on Thursday.

<P>
According to the accord, custom duties between Poland and Turkey
will be reduced to zero on all industrial products, except
sensitive products, by 2002.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Reformist Leader Summoned to Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Mohammad Reza Khatami, a prominent
leader of Iran's reformist campaign, was subpoenaed by the press
court on Thursday on charges of defamation, the Islamic Republic
News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, publisher of the Persian daily Mosharekat and younger
brother of Iranian President Seyyed Mohammad Khatami, was summoned
apparently on private charges of defamation or libel filed against
him earlier this month, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
According to Saeed Mortazavi, judge of the press court, did not
name the claimed victim of the defamation.
</P>
<P>
The judge declined to elaborate on the number or nature of the
charges brought against Khatami, only indicating that the reformist
is to stand trial next week, or perhaps later next month.
</P>
<P>
Khatami is also head of the leading reformist party Islamic Iran
Participation Front, which led the reformists to an overwhelming
victory over their conservative opponents in parliamentary
elections last month.
</P>
<P>
The reformists won more than 75 percent of the total 290 seats
in the expanded sixth parliament. Khatami himself was the winner of
the largest number of votes in the Tehran constituency, where
reformist candidates could seize at least 29 of the 30 seats,
although the result of partial vote recounting has not surfaced
yet.
</P>
<P>
The humiliating defeat of the conservatives has caused tension
in the country, a sign of which being the assassination attempt
against Saeed Hajjarian, another prominent reformist, earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian, a close adviser to President Khatami and head of the
reformist daily Sobh-e Emrouz (This Morning), has just regained his
consciousness from a severe wound, but his recovery is still
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
Many people doubt the statements made by investigators that the
assassin, a chemistry student at a Tehran university who has been
arrested, shot Hajjarian out of personal feelings and that he has
no link with any political bodies.

<HEADLINE> Job Vacancies Soar in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Further improvements in
unemployment in Australia appear certain with job vacancies
soaring 9.3 percent in the three months to February, the
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ABS said there were 112,700 job vacancies last month,
seasonally adjusted, up 9.3 percent on November and 36.1 percent
on a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Previous surveys had appeared to show job growth was slowing,
but the new figures indicate that further improvements in
unemployment are now likely for the rest of this year, the ABS
said.
</P>
<P>
With unemployment already at a decade-low of 6.7 percent, a
jobless rate of under 6 percent is now within reach, it said.
</P>
<P>
The figures showed that job vacancies rose strongly in the
Western Australia state, the Northern Territory, the states of
Queensland and New South Wales and marginally in the Australian
Capital Territory.
</P>
<P>
But there were significant falls in the states of Tasmania,
South Australia and Victoria, the ABS said.

PARIS, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Philippe Seguin, former president
of France's Gaullist Rally for the Republic (RPR), announced on
Thursday that he will run for the mayor of Paris in the municipal
election scheduled for March 2001.
</P>
<P>
In a two-page letter published in the daily Le Monde to the
present PRP President Michele Alliot-Marie, Seguin said he would
like to be the right-wing opposition candidate for the City Hall
of Paris.
</P>
<P>
"The challenge, I know, is exceptionally difficult to overcome.
But I have decided," he said.
</P>
<P>
The incumbent mayor of Paris, Jean Tiberi, who is also from the
PRP and a close friend of President Jacques Chirac, has also
expressed his intention to seek re-election when his term expires
in March 2001.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist Party is expected to appoint Bertrand Delanoe as
its candidate to lead a left-wing campaign team.
</P>
<P>
Another Socialist candidate, Jack Lang, withdrew from his
candidacy after being named Minister of National Education by
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin this week.
</P>
<P>
A recent poll published by the daily Le Parisien showed that a
RPR-led right-wing team will win the municipal election if led by
Seguin.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A three-day international
symposium on the issue of Chinese "comfort women" during the World
War II (1939-1945) period opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Those attending indignantly pointed out that the "comfort women
" system the Japanese militarists adopted during World War II is a
supreme disgrace in the history of mankind.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that such a seminar has been held in
China.
</P>
<P>
Materials provided by participants show that China is the
country that suffered greatest harm from this shameful event, as
statistics show that some 200,00 of the acknowledged 400,000 "
comfort women" were Chinese.
</P>
<P>
During the war, the Japanese invaders established "comfort
centers" in every place they trampled over in China.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese invasion troops established 83 such "comfort
centers" in Shanghai alone.
</P>
<P>
The symposium attracted 170 scholars from China's mainland,
Hong Kong and Taiwan, and Japan, the Republic of Korea, the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Philippines, the United
States, New Zealand, and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
During the symposium, participants will discuss issues
including the "comfort women" system, Unit 731, the Nanjing
Massacre, and post-war compensation from the Japanese government.

BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- China has seen more than 620 bush
fires around the country since the beginning of the year and has
suffered heavy casualties, the State Forestry Administration (SFA)
said today.
</P>
<P>

Recently, many major bush fires have broken out in southern China,
including Hubei, Jiangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang and Guizhou provinces
and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, as well as Shaanxi province
in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
The sudden surge of temperature and strong winds in this spring,
combined with farmers burning off shrubs and weeds, have caused
frequent bush fires.
</P>
<P>
Forest areas in northeast China and Inner Mongolia have entered
a high fire risk period.
</P>
<P>
SFA has urged all localities to give top priority to preventing
bush fire. It forbids local authorities from sending school
children, women, the elderly to fight against bush fires. SFA had
sent out a stern warning that local officials who delayed report
of fire would be reprimanded.

<HEADLINE> Australian Govt to Review UN Treaty System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government will
review the United Nations treaty system following a U.N. committee
's roasting last week over the country's indigenous rights,
Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The cabinet has determined that it would now be appropriate to
review how Australia participates in the U.N. treaty system,"
Downer said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The government has been under criticism for a year now from the
U.N. Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD)
over the Wik amendments to the Native Title Act and, more recently,
mandatory sentencing.
</P>
<P>
Downer lashed out at what he called CERD's political and
partisan approach when it examined Australia's periodic reports in
Geneva last week.
</P>
<P>
Downer said CERD, which administers the Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, had ignored
significant progress made in Australia across the spectrum of
indigenous issues.
</P>
<P>
"The committee's observations are little more than a polemical
attack on the government's indigenous policies," he said.
</P>
<P>
"They are based on an uncritical acceptance of the claims of
domestic political lobbies and take little account of the
considered reports submitted by the government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Downer said the government had promoted reforms of the U.N.
treaty body system since 1996 and had won support from countries
including Canada, New Zealand and Norway.
</P>
<P>
"The burdensome reporting requirements imposed by these
committees have become too great for most member states," he said.
"In many cases, there is an over-emphasis on non-government
submissions."
</P>
<P>
"This has led to a growing perception that the committees are
pursuing political agendas rather than fulfilling their expert
objectives," Downer added.
</P>
<P>
Downer said CERD's political approach was demonstrated by its
reference to Australia's obligations under the U.N. Refugee
Convention, a subject outside its mandate.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Tries to Absorb Street Kids to Formal Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is drawing a
program to ensure street children access to formal education
system, local newspapers reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Education officials said earlier this week at a workshop here
that government has instituted a Complementary Basic Education in
Tanzania (COBET) program in response to the inadequacy for the
formal primary and adult education system.
</P>
<P>
The Assistant Coordinator of COBET from the Ministry for
Education and Culture Anthony Ntilema was quoted by the newspapers
as saying that as the first step, about 600 street children
attending special classes in various parts of the country will be
allowed to join formal education system.
</P>
<P>
He told the National Consultation Workshop for Street Children
in Tanzanian that the Ministry had already communicated with the
National Examination Council to allow the children to sit for
standard seven final examinations after attending the three-year
COBET program.
</P>
<P>
The program, established by the ministry with great support
from UNICEF and UNESCO in 1997, teaches personality building,
vocational skills, communication skills, mathematics and general
knowledge in order to help the street children engage in
self-employment.
</P>
<P>
Most of the children have shown good progress in two pilot
districts in the country's capital Dar es Salaam under the program
which will expand to other areas with low enrolment problems.
</P>
<P>
According to papers presented at the workshop, there are now
about 2.25 million drop-out school age children around the
country.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Government Approves Low Military Expenditures for 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss government has approved
an arms procurement program worth 1.18 billion Swiss francs (about
700 million U.S. dollars) for the year 2000, one of the lowest
budgets in 15 years, according to a Swiss Radio International
report Thursday.
</P>
<P>
With the budget, the Swiss army will buy 186 Swedish-built CV-
9030 tanks, 120 battlefield command cars, and some mine-clearing
plows that can be fit to armored personnel carriers (APCs).
</P>
<P>
The CV-9030 APCs have already been ordered by the Swedish,
Norwegian, and Finnish armies. In Switzerland, the report said
that they will replace American-built M113 APCs, which on the
battlefield cannot keep up with the Swiss army's Leopard 2 tanks,
the mainstay of the national defense.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the procurement program for 2000 is
the second smallest in 15 years, reflecting the Defense Ministry's
falling budget, as well as lack of clarity about equipment needs
before sweeping reforms, dubbed Army 21, are finalized.
</P>
<P>
The 120 battlefield command cars will be built by Mowag in
eastern Switzerland, and are based on the chassis of the widely-
used American Hummer military vehicle.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss army will be using them as a fire-control vehicle,
which can pinpoint targets up to seven kilometers away and pass on
data directly to artillery or integrated fire control systems.

<HEADLINE> Survey Reveals Sexual Precocity of Chinese Teenagers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Compared with a decade ago,
Chinese urban teenagers are sexually mature at an earlier age, but
they are more mature psychologically and in reason when making
friends with opposite sex, a survey has shown.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by researchers from the Teenagers
Research Institute affiliated with the Shanghai Academy of Social
Sciences among 3,000 teenagers from the four big Chinese cities of
Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Wuhan.
</P>
<P>
Researchers found that the first menses of girls come at the
age of 12, compared with 13 ten years ago, and the first
spermatorrhea of boys comes at the age of 13 from 14 a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
Researchers said that sexual precocity is a common trend
internationally, and attributed this to taking excessive nutrition
and accepting increasing sexual information from news papers and
TV programs.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that 73 percent of the boy respondents and 88
percent of the girl respondents said they have received sexual
education to some extent. Their sexual knowledge mainly comes from
classroom, compared with from newspapers and literary works ten
years ago.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that all middle schools in Shanghai offer classes
on sex.
</P>
<P>
When answering the question "Why do you make friends with
opposite sex?", most of those surveyed said they want to have
better understanding with each other and to learn how to
communicate with others.
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, girls would say "Boys are strong and that makes
girls feel safe," and boys would say that "Girls are pretty,
lovely and tender."
</P>
<P>
The survey also reveals that the number of teenagers who have
kissed or have had sexual intercourse with friends of opposite sex
have dropped markedly.

<HEADLINE> HK Chief Executive Stresses Ethical Value on Anti-Corruption Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), noted here
Thursday that the highest ethical standards of Hong Kong is quite
necessary for the city to maintain its competitiveness and achieve
the goal of becoming Asia's world city.
</P>
<P>
"It is only through good ethical practices and the creation of
a clean and honest society that we are able to give everyone a
fair chance and an equal opportunity to compete, to succeed, and
to realize our dreams," Tung pointed out at the Ethical Leadership
Forum 2000 that opened here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Entitled "Turning Challenges into Opportunities," the forum
aims to assess how ethical management could address the challenges
faced by leaders in both the public and private sectors in the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 representatives from 10 countries and regions
attended the two-day forum organized by the Independent Commission
Against Corruption (ICAC) and the Civil Service Bureau of the
HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony, Tung said Hong Kong has a hard-
earned reputation as one of the world's most fair and open cities
to do business, noting that this is in large part due to the close
partnership between a community determined to uphold a clean way
of life and the ICAC dedicated to fighting corruption.
</P>
<P>
Tung said corruption remains firmly under control, nearly three
years after the establishment of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Every survey conducted by the ICAC in the past three years has
consistently reflected a high level of public confidence in the
government's anti-graft capability, he said, adding that 99
percent of the respondents said the Commission deserved their
support and more than 80 percent of those surveyed said they were
intolerant of corruption.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that ethics are at the core of any anti-corruption
strategy and maintaining high ethical standards in the conduct of
private business and the delivery of public services is the first
line of defense against corruption.
</P>
<P>
"Throughout the world, there are many, many examples of how
good ethical management has helped prevent graft," he added.

HONG KONG, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Some fascinating art works from
Chinese royal families in the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) will be
present on the Christie's Spring Auction on April 30, 2000,
according to Christie's Hong Kong Thursday.
</P>
<P>

In response to a question concerning the visit by US President'
s Adviser for National Security Affairs Samuel Berger, Sun urged
the United States to take more effective measures to pursue the "
One China" policy and abide by the principles set forth in the
three Sino-US joint communiques.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is of critical importance for the US to pursue
the "One China" policy, to abide by the principles set forth in
the three Sino-US joint communiques, and to honor its commitment
of three "nos", namely, not to support Taiwan's independence, not
to support "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan", and not to
support Taiwan's entry into any international organizations
requiring the membership of sovereignty states.
</P>
<P>
As for the Taiwan issue, the Chinese side reiterated its
principled stance and urged the US to fully understand the
sensitivity and complexity of the situation, and take effective
measures to adhere to the "One China" policy and observe the three
joint communiques, according to Sun.
</P>
<P>
Sun Yuxi expressed the hope that Japan would work to push
forward Sino-Japanese relations and not do anything which will
obstruct China's reunification cause.
</P>
<P>
Sun made the remarks in response to a question that Taiwan's
Chen Shui-bian plans to invite foreign party or government
officials, including those of Japan, to attend his so called
inauguration ceremony.
</P>
<P>
There is only one China in the world, and Taiwan is an
inseparable part of the Chinese territory, Sun stressed.
</P>
<P>
China opposes any country which has diplomatic ties with China
to establish or conduct official contacts with Taiwan, he said,
urging countries concerned to strictly observe the "One China"
policy and abide by their commitments made when diplomatic ties
were forged.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses U.S., Britain of Blocking Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi trade ministry on
Thursday lashed out at the United States and Britain for
deliberately blocking contracts Iraq signed with foreign countries
under the sixth phase of the United Nations oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
In a report carried by the Iraqi News Agency (INA), the trade
ministry said that the U.S. and British delegates at the U.N.
Sanctions Committee have blocked 42 contracts for Iraq to import
oil spare parts, electrical and agricultural equipments,
ambulances, medical appliances and other humanitarian goods.
</P>
<P>
The contracts were signed between Iraq and Algeria, Egypt,
Belgium, France, Russia, India, Malaysia and other Asian, African
and European countries, said the INA.
</P>
<P>
The accusation came at a time when U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on March 24 urged the Security Council to review the holds of
Iraq's contract applications by certain members of the U.N.
Sanctions Committee.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of the Security Council on the humanitarian
situation in Iraq, Annan said the holds of the contract
applications do have a direct negative impact on the U.N. oil-for-
food program and on the efforts to rehabilitate Iraq's
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. humanitarian oil-for-food deal, Iraq is allowed
to export a certain amount of oil and use part of the revenue,
under the U.N. supervision, to import food, medicine and other
humanitarian supplies for its 22 million people, who have been
under sweeping U.N. sanctions ever since Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. statistics, as of January 31, 2000, Iraq's
contracts worth 1.5 billion U.S. dollars have been put on hold, and
the U.S., one of the members of the sanctions committee, has put on
hold contracts worth more than 1 billion dollars alone.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly condemned the U.S. and Britain for impeding
the implementation of the oil-for-food deal by blocking its
contracts.

<HEADLINE> Iran Slams U.S. Pressure on OPEC to Raise Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Thursday slammed the United
States for exerting pressure on the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) to raise oil output, condemning such
pressure as a violation of "the global free trade norms and
regulations."
</P>
<P>
"The use of political and military levers and forcing other
countries to secure one's own economic interests are among
hegemonic methods which do not go with any logic," Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said.
</P>
<P>
Asefi's remarks came after the White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart said on Wednesday that the U.S. saw no reason to apologize
for its pressure on the OPEC to raise its output which led to an
immediate collapse of the oil price, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Despite Iran's opposition, nine of the 11 OPEC members on
Tuesday agreed in Vienna to raise their output by 6.3 percent, or a
total of 1.45 million barrels a day, to bring down oil prices as
the U.S. demanded.
</P>
<P>
Iran, after refusing to take part in the OPEC formal agreement
out of anger over the U.S. pressure, said on Wednesday that it will
also increase crude oil production to maintain its market share.
</P>
<P>
However, Tehran has not announced the increasing level of its
oil production. Iran had insisted that the OPEC output increase
should not be more than 1 million barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
The administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton hailed the
OPEC decision as a major diplomatic victory and Lockhart said that
Washington had succeeded in convincing oil producers that they were
not pumping enough oil to meet demand and high prices could
undermine the world economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. intervention was beyond expectations and never in the
history of the OPEC has this been experienced before," Iran's OPEC
Governor Hossein Kazempour Ardebili was also quoted by IRNA as
saying.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Make Pre-marriage HIV Check Compulsory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo said Wednesday that a bill would soon be sent to the
country's National Assembly to make compulsory Human-Immuno Virus
(HIV) tests compulsory for intending couples.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper, Thursday quoted
Obasanjo as telling a delegation of the United Nations Program on
HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) in the country's capital Abuja that he hoped the
legislation would support his administration's on-going effort at
combating the spread of the virus in the country.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, with an infection rate of 5.4 percent in its
population, has the second largest HIV/AIDS population in Africa,
according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The told the Executive Director of UNAIDS Peter Piot, who led
the delegation, that more support from the international community
in this regard is needed.
</P>
<P>
He said when meeting the delegation, which also include world
bank officials, that the debt remission for the country would free
some of the funds currently devoted to debt-servicing for its
multi-sectoral campaign against AIDS through the provision of
better education and health facilities.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria currently has a external debt burden of some 30 billion
U.S. dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is offering
education on wildlife to children, especially in primary schools,
making them become environment- friendly people.
</P>
<P>
The co-ordinator of Tanzania Wildlife Research Institute Anna
Lema has told a three-day workshop on wildlife that top priority
should be given to primary school teachers to lay down a good
foundation on wildlife awareness among pupils, local newspapers

"Wildlife education is of vital importance to be offered to
Tanzanian children so that they may become responsible adults,"
Lema said Wednesday in northern town of Arusha.
</P>
<P>
She said survival of wildlife and sustainable utilization of
available natural resources should top the agenda in Tanzania and
the whole African continent.
</P>
<P>
Lema said that with the help from the Messeli Foundation of
Switzerland, Tanzanian has so far spent a total of 350,000 U.S.
dollars for construction of a modern laboratory for wildlife at
Tarangire National Park in the north.
</P>
<P>
Though among the world's poorest countries, Tanzania abounds
with a whole cast of wild animals in the countrywide game reserves
and parks including the greatest Ngorongoro and Serengeti reserves
which witness the annual migration of more than two million
animals.
</P>
<P>
Some 25 percent of government's revenue comes from wildlife
related sectors, reports said.

<HEADLINE> France Prudent on Israeli Invitation to Deploy Troops in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 30 (Xinhua) -- France reacted with prudence
Thursday to an invitation by Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy
to deploy troops in the security zone in southern Lebanon after
the withdrawal of Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret said
that it is up to the international community, in particular U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan, to decide the change of role of the
U.N. Intermediary Force in Lebanon (UNIFL).
</P>
<P>
France has been participating in the UNIFL since its creation
in 1978 which serves as a bumper between Israeli and Arab forces.
</P>
<P>
But France is ready to contribute to security arrangement in
Lebanon if it is asked to do so, Gazeau-Secret said.
</P>
<P>
"If the parties ask us for it, we are completely ready to
participate in the arrangement of security," she said.
</P>
<P>
Levy said on Tuesday that Israel is "very favorable" to the
deployment of French troops in the security zone once Israel
finishes the process of withdrawing troops by July.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for Israel to express its interest in
having France play an active role in its peace process with
Lebanon.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing Municipality in
northwest China plans to invest 10 billion yuan (1.2 billion U.S.
dollars) to improve the ecological environment in the coming ten
years, officials said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, Chongqing will turn 183,300 ha of low-
yield farmland on slopes of mountains into forests and grassland,
take good care of the existing 2.3 million ha of forest resources,
and plant trees and grass in 1.06 million ha of wasteland.
</P>
<P>
When the work is finished in 2010, the city's vegetation
coverage rate will increase from 23 percent at present to 36
percent.
</P>
<P>
Due to excessive reclamation and logging in the past, 52.8
percent of Chongqing's land suffers from serious soil erosion,
with 100 million tons of soil washed into the Yangtze River each
year.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing is located in the area where construction of the
Three Gorges project, China's largest water-conservancy project,
is in full swing.
</P>
<P>
As part of the ambitious ten-year plan, the city will also make
great effort to ban unauthorized reclamation and logging, and
crack down illegal wood trading.

<HEADLINE> Attorney General to Summon Soeharto for Third Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JAKARTA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- After failing to examine
Indonesian former President Soeharto on Thursday morning, the
Attorney General's Office admitted to have been fed up by the
former strong man and has decided to summon him again next week.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua Thursday, Director of Corruption
at the Attorney General's Office Chairul Imam said: "We actually
could not accept that Soeharto refuses to appear and we have been
disappointed because he did not show up here to fulfill our second
summoning. But we have decided to summon him again next week."
</P>
<P>
"This evening (Thursday), we will send again a letter to
Soeharto to undergo examination on Monday, next week at 09:00 a.m.
(local time) at the Attorney General's Office," he added.
</P>
<P>
It will be the third summons to him, Imam said, adding the
Attorney General's Office will follow the rule of the country's
crime code under which it stipulates that if a suspect in a crime
case refuses the summon to undergo investigation, the prosecutors
still have opportunity to make the next summon up to three times,
and if the suspect keeps refusing the summoning, they have
authorities to take steps by force to present the suspect.
</P>
<P>
But he declined to reveal what steps will be taken by the
Attorney General's Office, if the 78-year-old strong man fails
again to meet the third summon.
</P>
<P>
"We, of course, already have got plans: A, B and C. But I am
sorry not to tell you about that," the director said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Peter Velappan, secretary
general of the Asia's soccer governing body AFC, has criticized
Saudi Arabian club Al Ahli for withdrawing from the semifinals of
this year's Asian Cup Winners' Cup.
</P>
<P>
Al Ahli, who were due to meet Iraqi side Al Zawra in Thailand,
decided not to take part in the competition without giving any
reason.
</P>
<P>
"We find the withdrawal unacceptable," said Velappan in a press
release. "The decision is detrimental to the image of the
tournament and to the commercial interests.
</P>
<P>
"It is unfortunate that we still have national associations and
clubs that are not serious about their participation in AFC
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
"Their actions only serve to seriously undermine the AFC's
efforts to promote football on the continent."
</P>
<P>
He added that the club may face a fine or a ban from AFC
competitions but any disciplinary action has to be discussed the
next meeting of the AFC's executive committee to be held in Kuala
Lumpur on May 17.
</P>
<P>
Al Ahli's place in the semifinals has been offered to
Uzbekistan's Novbakhor, who lost to Al Ahli in the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
Shimizu S-Pulse of Japan and Thailand's Bangkok Bank will play
in the other match. Both games will be played on April 13 with the
final on April 15.

<HEADLINE> WB Official: Chengdu Citizens Paying More Attention to Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, March 30 (Xinhua) -- People in Chengdu, capital of
southwest China's Sichuan Province, are now paying more attention
to their health and life style, a World Bank official said
recently after an inspection tour here.
</P>
<P>
Jagadish Vpadhyay, executive in charge of the World Bank Human
Development Department of the East Asia and the Pacific, said that
"unexpected results" have been achieved in Chengdu since the
Health Promotion Project financed by the World Bank was launched
in seven Chinese cities in 1996, including Beijing, Shanghai,
Tianjin, Kunming, and Liuzhou. The project was aimed at preventing
and controlling chronic, non-infectious, and venereal diseases, as
well as accidents.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank granted a total of 15 million U.S. dollars in
loans for this project in China, and Chengdu received 1.15 million
dollars of this, to go along with local supporting funds in the
amount of 10 million yuan (1.2 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The fund was used to launch education campaigns to raise public
awareness of health, and warn people of the risks of smoking, an
unbalanced diet, high blood pressure, AIDs, and accident.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the number of young smokers in the city decreased
by 20 percent, and deaths caused by malignant tumors, coronary
heart disease, and cerebral hemorrhage were also reduced.
</P>
<P>
At present, the health project covers one million people in
Chengdu, half of the city's population.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak does not believe there is
room for optimism regarding the Syrian peace track anymore, a
senior official in his office said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Looking seriously at the implications of the failed Sunday
summit between Syrian President Hafez al-Assad and U.S. President
Bill Clinton, Barak has realized that the window of opportunity is
closed.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel should begin moves to import water from Turkey,
according to a recommendation by the prime minister's adviser on
water affairs, Noah Kinarti.
</P>
<P>
Kinarti is currently in the final stages of formulating a
proposal to that effect, which will be presented to the Ministerial
Economics Committee when it meets on April 17. According to the
plan, Israel will purchase 50 million cubic meters of water a year
from Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Water experts said that even if the last two winters had been
rainier, Israel would also have found itself with extremely low
levels in ground water reservoirs and in the Lake Kinneret, due to
its large dependence on the reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- The High Court of Justice on Wednesday ordered the state to
allow 700 Palestinian cave-dwellers, expelled last November by the
army, to return to their homes in the south Hebron Hills.
</P>
<P>
At the opening of the hour-long hearing, Supreme Court President
Aharon Barak proposed appointing an investigator to examine the
claims of each of the Palestinians to see if they lived in the
caves full time before their eviction. In the meantime, they would
be allowed to return to the caves at first.
</P>
<P>
The Israel Defense force declared the area a restricted military
zone many years ago and imposed restrictions on the residents'
movement. It issued an expulsion order last November and evicted
all of them, claiming they used the caves seasonally but had homes
in nearby villages outside the firing zone.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel's Shas leader and Labor and Social Affairs Minister
Eli Yishai promised on Wednesday to seriously consider backing
Likud legislator Silvan Shalom's bill calling for early elections.
</P>
<P>
Shalom, who met with Yishai Wednesday, first raised the bill a
couple of months ago, but at the time there appeared to be little
interest in it. Now, with real concern in the air about the future
of the coalition, Shalom has decided to strike.
</P>
<P>
The bill will be pursued in the first week the Knesset
(parliament) reconvenes after its Passover recess, which begins
Thursday. A similar bill led to the downfall of former prime
minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his Likud-led coalition.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Pakistani Chief
Executive Pervez Musharraf Thursday reaffirmed that Pakistan will
return to civil government as soon as possible as his government
has mounted a nation-building drive.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when he met the Pakistani community in
Singapore on his last day here as part of his southeast Asian tour
which has taken him to Malaysia and will take him to Indonesia,
Brunei and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf told more than 150 audiences that "We certainly want
to return to civil government as soon as possible. But we do not
want to bring back a system which will reverse whatever is good
for the time. Therefore, we are to think what kind of structure is
required for Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
He said there are four guiding principles his government is
following and these are to let the people be the master of their
own destiny, let the government functionaries be subordinate to
the people, to give people financial and fiscal autonomy and to
bring justice to society.
</P>
<P>
Touching the topic of democracy, he said his country will return
to democracy and there are more democracy now than before.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf said his government is working for strategic changes
and structural reform and is determined to revive the economy by
taking a series of measures to strengthen the economic foundation
and broaden the bases of the economy which he said is suffering
and poorly managed.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf called on Pakistanis overseas to contribute to the
building of Pakistan, saying overseas Chinese can contribute to
the building of China and overseas Pakistani can also contribute
to the building of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf arrived in Singapore Wednesday for a two-day working
visit and met with Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, Senior
Minister Lee Kuan Yew and President S.R. Nathan on the same day.

<HEADLINE> Asian Economies Upturn Benefits Australia's Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The upturn of the Asian
economies would continue to benefit Australian exports, federal
Treasurer Peter Costello said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Australia's trade deficit improved sharply in February, 2000,
dropping below the 1-billion-Australian dollar (660 million U.S.
dollars) mark for only the third time in the past 14 months.
</P>
<P>
Costello said most of Asia was now starting to show some
economic growth and "that's good for Australia."
</P>
<P>
"We now have better exporting opportunities and we believe over
the next year or two Australia's balance of payments problems will
continue to improve," he said.
</P>
<P>
Costello welcomed the strengthening Australian export position
as global growth came back after the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"As the world starts to grow stronger again, Australia's
exports will pick up," he said.
</P>
<P>
Costello also mentioned that interest rates around the world
had moved up as world growth had picked up and the world economy
had grown stronger than expected.
</P>
<P>
"But it's not an altogether bad thing. The reason they're
moving up is that the world economy is strengthening and as the
world economy strengthens, Australia will do better on its export
front," he added.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Develops Environment-friendly Diesel Engine for Bus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Successful development of an
environment-friendly diesel engine is expected to provide clean
energy for public transportation in Shanghai, the largest
industrial and commercial center in China.
</P>
<P>
Jointly developed by the Shanghai Diesel Engine Co. Ltd, an
Austrian diesel development institute and the Shanghai Jiaotong
University, the new product, which is mainly installed in buses,
has demonstrated itself as a quiet, energy-saving, and powerful
engine in the trial use for the past one year.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is rated by the World Health Organization as one of
the most heavily polluted cities in the world, which prompted the
local government to increase effort for air population reduction
by imposing restrictions on exhausts discharged by automobiles and
introducing green engines for various automobiles.
</P>
<P>
Company officials from the Shanghai Diesel Engine Co. Ltd said
the company is also developing other engine series using condensed
natural gas or liquid petroleum gas to meet the mounting need for
green engines.

<HEADLINE> Development to Green Western Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The planned development of China'
s vast western region will help to bring back clear skies and
green lands, according to Tian Fengshan, minister of land and
resources.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few days, gusty winds from the northwest swept
through much of the country, blowing dust into the capital and
even down to the east provinces of Anhui and Shandong.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, the country's largest eastern industrial city, was
also hit by muddy rains, which meteorologists blamed on worsening
ecological deterioration in the less developed northwest regions
of the country.
</P>
<P>
The nasty winds accompanying dust and muddy rains have again
highlighted the urgency of environmental protection in the west as
well as the economic development.
</P>
<P>
The nation already learned a lesson from the west's
environmental deterioration when China was hit by the worst floods
years ago at the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtse River.
</P>
<P>
"Western development will not only affect the lives of local
residents, but also the fundamental interests of the whole nation,
" the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
To improve the ecological environment in the west, Tian said,
50 million hectares of land there will be reconverted from
farmland to forests and grassland over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
These and other efforts will greatly improve the environment of
the western region as well as that of the whole country.
</P>
<P>
"When the west is green, the Chinese people will be able to see
clearer skies and rivers," the minister said.

<HEADLINE> Top Fine Arts Academy to Relocate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Central Academy of Fine Arts,
the cradle of Chinese painters, will soon end its embarrassing
situation of being in a factory-owned building, and will relocate
to a 13.3-hectare venue in northeast Beijing this September.
</P>
<P>
The academy gained attention when it moved from its original
location on downtown Wangfujing Street five years ago, as some
people asked whether art should give way to commerce.
</P>
<P>
The new school will be located at the Wangjing New Quarter and
will cover an area six times that of its original place. The
academy will include a teaching building, library, and multi-
functional and designing buildings.
</P>
<P>
Jin Shangyi, president of the academy, said his teachers and
students are very satisfied with the new academy.
</P>
<P>
The new academy will establish an art exhibition hall, while
the old location on Wangfujing still has another exhibition hall.
</P>
<P>
The academy, founded in 1918, was the first state-run fine arts
institute in China and home to the country's most influential
painters and sculptors.
</P>
<P>
Teachers and students there painted the portrait of Mao Zedong
which hangs over the Tiananmen Rostrum, and completed many
political works for the country.
</P>
<P>
Some foreigners see the academy as one of the first
destinations to visit to learn about Chinese culture. The academy
presently has over 1,000 teachers and students.

"He did not come today because he was sick, it is
understandable.But he will be summoned again. The office insists
on summoning Soeharto as soon as possible," spokesman of the
Attorney General's Office R.J. Soehandoyo told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto's lawyer Juan Felix Tampubolon sent a letter to the
Attorney General Wednesday, explaining his client cannot fulfill
the second summons.
</P>
<P>
The Attorney General's Office issued the first summons earlier
this month but only the former president's lawyers showed up,
saying Soeharto could not fulfill it for health reasons.
</P>
<P>
The office then sought the opinion of an independent medical
team,which found Soeharto fit to undergo questioning.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Attorney General's Office again formally
summoned the 78-year-old Soeharto for questioning about alleged
corruption in the charities he used to control.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was named as a suspect for alleged corruption during
his 32-year-rule after Attorney General Marzuki Darusman decided
to reopen the case in December last year.
</P>
<P>
U.S. business magazine Forbes last year estimated Soeharto's
family fortune at some 4 billion U.S. dollars. Time magazine, also
from U.S.,has put the figure at about 15 billion dollars.

HARARE, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Commercial Farmers' Union
(CFU) of Zimbabwe has rejected the offer by the British government
to evacuate local white farmers whose farms were invaded by
land-hungry black veterans, The Herald newspaper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
CFU President Tim Henwood told reporters at the CFU
headquarters in Harare Wednesday night that foreigners should
desist from interfering in the land issue, as it needed a
Zimbabwean solution.
</P>
<P>
His statement flies in the face of claims by the British that
the farmers had been registering for possible evacuation.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that local commercial farmers would not seek
recourse from foreign governments.
</P>
<P>
"The land reform issue is a Zimbabwean issue and will be
addressed and solved by Zimbabweans," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The majority of commercial farmers are Zimbabweans committed
to our country and its future. We therefore believe a permanent
solution will be found to the present situation very soon," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"I call upon everybody involved, internally and externally, to
refrain from emotional reaction and interference. Zimbabweans
will solve this problem in a cool and level-headed manner," he
said.

<HEADLINE> 86 Unqualified Gem Pits Closed by Tanzanian Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
has closed down 86 Tanzanite pits in northern Arusha region
because owners have failed to observe required mining procedures,
the Guardian newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The gem pits in Simanjiro District of the region were closed
down on Monday by the Mining Department in the Ministry of Energy
and Minerals after mining experts inspected them in February this
year, a senior official in the department Alex Magayane was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 19 pits were allowed to continue with the mining as
they had observed required procedures.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned some of the conditions that the owners failed to
observe as lack of identification cards for their employees and
lack of first aid kits.
</P>
<P>
Other conditions they did not meet include lack of special
communication facilities, lack of special helmets for miners and
lack of oxygen bags.
</P>
<P>
Magayane said the inspection exercise would continue to net
miners who were not following procedures. His department would
take punitive measures against any miners who failed to observe
procedures put in place to avert accidents.
</P>
<P>
The procedures were introduced by the government in 1998,
following a ghastly accident that killed more than 100 miners
working in a Tanzanite pit in the region.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanite is a precious and exotic gem that is found
exclusively in a tiny area in Arusha region. Buried 2,000 feet
below the surface, it is carefully mined by hand to avoid damage
to the precious little supply.

KAMPALA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan police have dispersed 200
 followers of another cult, the Universal Apostolic Church for the
Restless, in Mukono Town, 30 kilometers east of the capital
Kampala.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the followers of the cult were girls between 13 to15,"
Central Region Police Commander Chris Bakesiima told Xinhua

"We suspect the cult leaders, a pastor and his wife, have
purposes of collecting money, forcing the girls to work on a farm

<HEADLINE> U.S. Seagate Technology Inc. to Go Private in 20-Billion Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Silicon Valley-based Veritas
Software and an investment group led by Silver Lake Partners
announced a 20-billion-U.S.-dollar deal Wednesday to take disk-
drive maker Seagate Technology Inc. private.
</P>
<P>
Veritas, the world's largest maker of storage management
software, will acquire all Veritas shares held by Seagate, worth
about 18 billion dollars, as well as certain securities owned by
Silicon Valley-based Seagate and cash, according to reports from
the company.
</P>
<P>
Seagate, the world largest computer disk-drive and tape-drive
maker, had acquired about 153 million shares of Veritas common
stock when it sold its Software Network and Storage Management
Group to Veritas in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
The investor group, which also includes Seagate management and
Texas Pacific Group, will acquire the Seagate operating businesses
for approximately 2 billion dollars in cash, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources said the surprise deal would create the
biggest private high-tech firm in Silicon Valley in what is
believed to be the first instance of such a large and well-
established technology company being taken private.
</P>
<P>
Mark Leslie, chairman and CEO of Veritas, said in a conference
call Wednesday that the transaction would increase the company's
earnings per share by about 7.5 percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The transaction, which is expected to close in the third
quarter of this year, needs to be approved by Veritas and Seagate
stockholders.

Typically, faster processors are sold in new computers since
the way the machines are made means it is harder to simply replace
the chip in an older system.

<HEADLINE> Seoul Says International Aid to DPRK Hits 380 Million Dollars in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The combined assistance from the
international community to the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK) reached 380 million U.S. dollars last year, the South
Korean Unification Ministry said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The United States ranked the first with 270 million dollars,
followed by China with 78.6 million, South Korea with 46.88
million and the European Union with 37.4 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The international assistance to the DPRK stood at 260 million
dollars in 1997 and 330 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, a United Nations report said that 235.84
million dollars worth of humanitarian aid was delivered to the
DPRK last year.
</P>
<P>
The difference in the figures of the U.N. report and the
Unification Ministry is believed to lie in the reported aid and
leftover aid from the previous year, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
So the actual amount of aid to the DPRK last year rose by 28
percent from 1998, it added.

<HEADLINE> New Insurance Products to Be Introduced to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 30 (Xinhua) -- American International Assurance
's Shanghai Co. has decided to launch two new insurance products,
participating endowment with coupon, and endowment with dividend,
in April.
</P>
<P>
Industry insiders say these will be the first insurance
products in China's mainland that enable policy-holders to share
insurers' profits by offering dividends.
</P>
<P>
Nysco Shu, general manager of American International Assurance'
s Shanghai Co., said the decision aims to meet the growing demand
of local people for a wider variety of insurance products.
</P>
<P>
American International, which was present in Shanghai as early
as 1931, became the first licensed overseas insurance company in
this metropolis in 1992. Its insurance business has been growing
steadily in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, the insurance market has been brisk since China
resumed insurance business in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China's insurance sector reported a premium income
of 139.3 billion yuan (about 17 billion U.S. dollars), up 10
percent from 1998.
</P>
<P>
Among these premiums, 52.1 billion yuan was from property
insurance, up nearly three percent from 1998, and 87.2 billion
yuan from life and health insurance, up 15 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Tea baking specialists are here
performing in department stores in a bid to boost sales.
</P>
<P>
One of the tea-bakers, a lady identifying herself only as Yang
from south China's Zhejiang Province, said that from the end of
March to the end of April is the best time to sell tea.
</P>
<P>
She added that customers are curious about the making of ready
tea, especially the famous longjing and biluochun varieties. "When
they see the baking, they're ready to buy."
</P>
<P>
Spring is the ripe time for early tea sprouts, and the best
quality green tea is transported from south China's Jiangsu
Province, known for biluochun tea, and Yang's Province, known for
longjing tea.
</P>
<P>
To date, 70 kilograms of longjing tea at 800 yuan (96 U.S.
dollars) per 500 gram has been sold at the Yansha Department
Store this month.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Relies on Suppliers for Food Inspection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh continues to rely on
agents chosen by suppliers for inspecting the grains it imports
despite the launch of a pre-shipment inspection system on February
15.
</P>
<P>
Internationally reputed and experienced firms show little
interest in undertaking pre-shipment inspection of the imported
grain because of lack of transparency in the procurement process,
red tape and fear of unnecessary harassment by some bureaucrats in
the relevant ministry, The New Nation newspaper reported here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Food Ministry depends on the suppliers' choice
in appointing the inspection agent for assessing both quality and
quantity of the grains before shipment.
</P>
<P>
Under the existing rules introduced by the ministry, the pre-
shipment inspection of imported grain is conducted by firms to be
appointed by the suppliers at their own cost.
</P>
<P>
However, some people question the transparency of the existing
rules, which they said leave a loophole for underhand deals
between suppliers and buyers.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Reaffirms One-China Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Wednesday reaffirmed his support for the one-China policy.
</P>
<P>
"I support the one-China policy," Clinton told a press
conference at the White House which covered a broad range of
issues around the world.
</P>
<P>
It is the second time in less than two weeks that Clinton
reiterated his commitment to the one-China policy since Chen Shui-
bian, candidate for the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), won
the regional election in Taiwan on March 18.
</P>
<P>
Clinton noted that the United States made an agreement on the
one-China policy with the Chinese a long time ago, "when we
normalized relations under President (Jimmy) Carter, after a
period of years of developing them, starting with President (
Richard) Nixon's historic trip there."
</P>
<P>
The one-China policy, he said, has ever since become "the
unanimous bipartisan position of every president and every
administration that that was the right decision."
</P>
<P>
Clinton warned that the U.S.-China relations "would be at a
critical stage if we were to abandon our one-China policy."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the WTO issue, Clinton said that the United States
needs to give its businesses, farmers and workers access to the
world's largest consumer market in China.
</P>
<P>
"There is no more important long-term international economic or
national security issue facing us today," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who submitted to the Capitol Hill earlier this month a
piece of legislation advocating Permanent Normal Trade Relations (
PNTR) for China, urged Congress to pass the bill this spring.
</P>
<P>
"If we do not do this, then the full benefits of all we
negotiated will flow to all the other countries in the WTO, but
not to the United States. The economic consequences will be bad.
The national security consequences will be worse," he said.
</P>
<P>
If the United States rejects China PNTR, "we'll lose economic
opportunities we'll regret for 20 years," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has launched a nation-wide campaign
in the past weeks to mobilize support for China's entry into the
WTO and normalized trade status with the country. A debate and
vote on the PNTR bill is now impending in Congress, where a fierce
battle is expected, especially in the House of Representatives.

The survey, completed at the end of February by the Beijing

respondents said they want to gain more knowledge in these areas,
3.5 percent more than last year.
</P>
<P>
"The basic national policy of revitalizing the nation through
science and technology has become the common interest of the whole

</P>
<P>
The report reveals that in 1999, Beijing residents with
university education saw a noticeable increase in their incomes
compared with those less educated.
</P>
<P>
In addition, over 50 percent of people with higher education
also expect to earn more in the next one or two years. Among those
with secondary school education, only 25 percent expect their
lives to be improved in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
The marked increase in the income of the well-educated is
producing a positive impact on people's understanding and pursuit

ISLAMABAD, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Anti-Terrorist Court-
1 will announce its judgment on April 6 in connection with an
October 12 plane hijacking conspiracy case against deposed Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif and six other suspects, a news dispatch from
Karachi said.
</P>
<P>
Before announcing his order on Wednesday in Karachi where the
court is based, Judge Rehmat Husain Jaffery appreciated the
conduct of both prosecution and defense lawyers which he said
ensured smooth trial proceedings.
</P>
<P>
Sharif on Wednesday claimed innocence. "I have full faith in
Allah. I am innocent," he told reporters in the court as the trial
ended.
</P>
<P>
"General Pervez Musharraf has claimed he is not vindictive but
he has crossed all the boundaries and he is on the path of the
worst vindictiveness," Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
On October 12 last year, Sharif, who was then the country's
prime minister, announced the removal of Musharraf from his post
in the armed forces when the latter was on a visit abroad.
</P>
<P>
However, later on the same day Musharraf came back, dissolved
the government, detained Sharif and put him on trial.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution has demanded death penalty for Sharif and six
other suspects on charges of hijacking, kidnapping,attempted
murder and terrorism.

Soeharto defied the summons of the Attorney General's Office to
appear for questioning over alleged corruption Thursday.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Attorney General's Office again formally
summoned the 78-year-old Soeharto for questioning about alleged
corruption in the charities he used to control.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was also named a suspect in connection with the
corruption case in February. However he denies any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
The former ruler failed to show up when first summoned last
month.His lawyers and medical team argued that he was too ill to
do so. The former president was twice hospitalized last year after
suffering a stroke.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Attorney General Marzuki Darusman said an
independent medical team found Soeharto well enough for
questioning.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto's lawyer wrote to Marzuki on Wednesday, reiterating
the position that Soeharto could not make it on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
They underlined the report by the independent medical team that
Soeharto's speech impediment rendered him inadequate to answer
questions.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Swimming Champion Liu Eyes Olympic Gold for China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- With a pair of newly-crowned NCAA
titles, Chinese swimmer Liu Limin blow out her birthday candles
and said a prayer to herself: Never repeat the feat at Sydney
Olympic Games as in Atlanta four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Liu just returned from American Nevada University last Thursday
to contest a berth of the Chinese Olympic team at the national
swimming trial in mid May.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic silver medalist in Atlanta, who celebrated her 24-
year-old birthday on Monday, said:" I will strike out for an
Olympic gold medal this time. I have been dreaming the glorious
title for four years."
</P>
<P>
Narrowly missing the gold in the women's 100 meters butterfly
by 0.01 second to American golden-girl Amy Van Dyken, Liu burst
into tears and was embraced by her coach Zhao Ge after she
finished the event.
</P>
<P>
"I will never forget the failure. However, it won't be the
nightmare hovering in my mind for whole life. Only the one who
overwhelm the shadow of the failure can be regarded a successful
person," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Following a poor performance at the Chinese National Games in
1997, Liu went to Nevada for studying, where she swam under the
distant-regime through E-mail made by her coach and national head
coach Zhao from China.
</P>
<P>
Liu won the first swimming gold medal for Nevada University at
NCAA last year and took two more golds in the butterfly two weeks
ago. Her two minutes 06.04 seconds in the 200 meters butterfly was
the second best result of the world short course swimming this
year.
</P>
<P>
Liu will meet two domestic rivals, Ruan Yi and Pang Ran, on her
way to Sydney. If she qualifies she faces two title contenders,
American Jenny Thompson and Australian Susan O'Neill in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Veteran Thompson broke the world 100m butterfly mark on the
Athens short-course swimming championships, which ended March 19.
O'Neill set the new world short-course record in the 200m
butterfly with a time of 2:04.16 in Sydney in January during a
world Cup series.
</P>
<P>
"I will try my best to accomplish my Olympic dream in Sydney,"
said the Chinese butterfly queen.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A team of Japanese experts are
undertaking a preliminary feasibility study project to upgrade Sri
Lanka's southern Galle harbor as a multi-purpose port for regional
needs.
</P>
<P>
The project, which will cost 1.8 million U.S. dollars, is being
carried out by the Japan International Cooperation Agency, the
official Daily News reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
First testing is scheduled to commence on Thursday one and a
half kilometers away from the shore at Galle harbor, 116
kilometers south of Colombo, the report quoted Ports Development
Ministry officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The project aims to explore possibilities to build a two multi-
purpose berths with a depth of 12 meters adjoining the existing
harbor.
</P>
<P>
The target capacity of Galle harbor's initial development is 1
million tons of general bulk cargo and 190,000 twenty-foot
equivalent units of containers, said the report.
</P>
<P>
An implementation plan is expected to be ready by October this
year, the report said, adding that the Japanese yen component will
be over 50 percent to meet construction and other costs.
</P>
<P>
Galle harbor is the third largest harbor in Sri Lanka after
Colombo harbor in the southwest and Trincomalee harbor in the
northeast.

<HEADLINE> Polish President Invites Putin to Visit Warsaw </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Polish President Aleksander
Kwasniewski invited Wednesday Russian President-elect Vladimir
Putin to Poland in an effort to mend soured bilateral ties, and to
return his early 1996 visit to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation, Kwasniewski congratulated Putin on
his victory in Monday's presidential elections, the president's
press office was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Worried that Russia might become a tough neighbor after Putin
takes presidency, Kwasniewski extended the olive by initiating the
telephone call. Early this month he made another call to Putin,
acting president, to thank Russia for rescuing two kidnapped
Polish scientists.
</P>
<P>
The Polish head of state expressed his belief that "the best
possible relations would be built between the two countries, which
share the same value, history, experiences and mutual sympathy."
</P>
<P>
Putin, in return, vowed to actively create the best conditions
for the development of bilateral relations, but noting "the
proximity of the two states calls for top-level mutual relations
as well as for elimination of incidents and barriers that block it.
"
</P>
<P>
Ties between the two former cold war allies went frosty in the
1990s as Poland leant to the West, obtaining NATO membership last
year, and further worsened in January when Warsaw deported nine
Russian diplomats on espionage accusations. Russia retaliated by
expelling Polish diplomats in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Moscow canceled the planned visit by its foreign minister to
Poland in protest at an attack on a Russian consulate in Poland by
pro-Chechen demonstrators last month when Kwasniewski claimed
Polish-Russian relations had sunk to a new low.

<HEADLINE> Somoza Jr. Suspends Visit to Nicaragua </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Anastasio Somoza Portocarrero,
the son of deposed Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle,
has suspended his planned visit to the country amid increasingly
strong opposition.
</P>
<P>
The Primerisima Radio network here reported Wednesday that
Somoza Jr., also known as "El Chinguin," has sent a letter to his
cousin Alejandro Sevilla Somoza living in Nicaragua, telling him
the conditions for his trip are not appropriate at this moment.
</P>
<P>
Somoza Jr. was invited by the right-wing Nationalist Liberal
Party founded by other Somoza family members, who have returned to
Nicaragua during the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman rejected the visit Tuesday
in a communique, saying it was "provocative and reckless" and "
will never be tolerated."
</P>
<P>
The most strong opposition came from former president Daniel
Ortega, the leader of National Liberation Sandinista Front (FSLN),
who warned that if Anastasio Somoza Portocarrero arrives in the
country, the people will know how to do justice and will receive
him "with shots."
</P>
<P>
Somoza Jr. established a training school during his father's
rule, which the Sandinistas said is for training killers to
assassinate dissidents opposing the Somoza regime.
</P>
<P>
After the triumph of the 1979 revolution led by the FSLN, the
Somoza family fled the country in 1980 and Somoza Debayle was
assassinated by guerrillas in Paraguay in the same year.

<HEADLINE> IMF to Delay Aid to Indonesia Until Mid-May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund (
IMF)will delay disbursement of its next 400 million U.S. dollars
in loan to Indonesia until mid-May from its original schedule of
April 4, according to IMF Chief Representative John Dodsworth here.
</P>
<P>
He said a review of Indonesia's performance in implementing
previously agreed measures had originally been scheduled for early
April but the review will now be postponed for two weeks so that
disbursement of further financial assistance could only be done in
May.
</P>
<P>
"We see that the review will be completed some time in the
first half of April. And after the review, it needs about three
weeks until the executive board can meet," Dodsworth was quoted by
national newspapers Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the bulk of the structural measures as agreed to in a
letter of intent are still outstanding, but he added that he
believed they could be implemented in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Dodsworth reiterated several top-priority programs, including
corporate restructuring strategy and its framework, which should
be in place by mid-April, recapitalization of state banks and
reform of the tax system.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need for good procedures within the
Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency (IBRA) for debt restructuring
and a more effective bankruptcy court to deal with non-cooperative
debtors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and
Industry Kwik Kian Gie said the government was working all out to
meet the targets of its reform measures as agreed with the IMF.
</P>
<P>
"We are attempting to implement (the reforms) as quickly as
possible," he added.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Bambang Sudibyo said the postponement would
not be a great problem because the IMF aid is used to support the
country's balance of payments.
</P>
<P>
The controversy over the IMF aid rattled the foreign exchange
market on Tuesday and Wednesday. The Indonesian rupiah at the
Jakarta inter-bank spot market was closed at 7,575/7,595 per U.S.
dollar on Wednesday, compared with 7,475/7,485 on Tuesday.

AMMAN, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Jordan and Sudan stressed that the
peace process between Israel and its Arab neighbors must be based
on relevant U.N. resolutions and the principle of land for peace.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made in a joint statement issued Thursday at the
end of a three-day meeting of the Joint Higher Committee of the two
countries which was chaired by Jordanian Prime Minister Abdel Rauf
Rawabdeh and visiting Sudanese Vice President Ali Taha.
</P>
<P>
The statement highlighted the necessity to advance the peace

242, 338, 425 and the land-for-peace principle.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Arafat Urges Greater British Role in Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Yasser Arafat on Thursday called on Britain to play
a greater role in pushing forward the Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the appeal during a meeting with visiting British
Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Peter Hain in the West Bank
city of Ramallah, the Palestinian News Agency (WAFA) reported.
</P>
<P>
"The president reiterated his request that the British
government play a more active role in the peace process,"
Palestinian Minister of Planning and International Cooperation
Nabil Sha'ath was quoted as saying by WAFA.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also dealt with Europe's role in advancing the peace
process including the interim and final-status talks between the
Palestinians and Israel, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Hain, who is on a three-day visit to the region, reaffirmed his
country's continuous support for the Palestinians and expressed the
hope that the Palestinian people would be able to achieve their
aspirations for an independent state.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has repeated on several occasions to declare an
independent state with or without a peace deal with Israel by
September.
</P>
<P>
He said he discussed with Arafat ways of enhancing Britain's
role in the peace process given Britain's great abilities and good
relations with all parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
"But our concern is that the clock is ticking away and it is
important that all the issues of substance in the negotiations are
met by their deadline in September," Hain told reporters after the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians have set a self-imposed May deadline
to draft a framework agreement on the most thorny issues dividing
them, including the status of Jerusalem, the return of Palestinian
refugees and land issues, before concluding a final peace treaty by
September.
</P>
<P>
The Land Day, which is commemorated by the Palestinians on March
30 every year, "reminds us of the injustice done to the Palestinian
people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Britain and its partners in the European Union are looking
forward to the success of the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks and
the establishment of the Palestinian independent state, he added.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiating teams have returned home
from Washington after ending a session of talks on Tuesday with no
tangible progress made. The two sides agreed to meet again on April
6.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Thursday, Hain said his country was opposed to a
unilateral declaration of statehood in case the peace talks fail to
produce an agreement on the issue by September.
</P>
<P>
"A unilateral declaration will not serve the interest of the
Palestinians," he asserted.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative
Council Ahmed Qureia earlier in the day, the British minister said
his country would recognize the future Palestinian state when it is
declared.
</P>
<P>
Hain arrived here Thursday morning from Israel on a one-day
visit to the Palestinian self-rule areas.

JERUSALEM -- Israel's scientists have developed the first
medical weapon in the world to fight against the virulent strains
of staphylococcal and streptococcal bacteria, commonly known as "
flesh-eating" germs.
</P>
<P>
A research team led by Professor Raymond Kaempfer of Hadassah
Faculty of Medicine in Israel's Hebrew University made this
breakthrough after four-year-long hard work, sources in the
university said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Their research will appear in the April 1 issue of the
scientific journal Nature Medicine, which will possibly lead to a
practical treatment against such germs.
</P>
<P>
Flesh-eating bacteria can cause victims' system failures by
toxic shock and kill them within a day or even a matter of hours,
leaving no time for doctors to treat the infection. (Israel-Germs)

<HEADLINE> IDB Suspends Signing of Loan to Nicaragua </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB) suspended signing of a 10 million dollar loan for
Nicaraguan institutions, Nicaragua's representative of this
international organism, David Atkinson, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The suspending of signing for this loan is due to "technical"
problems or differences of figures in documents, explained
Atkinson.
</P>
<P>
This cooperation covenant had anticipated signing last
Wednesday between the IDB's president and Nicaragua's finance
minister.
</P>
<P>
These 10 million dollar funds will be used to support the
modernization of General Income Direction (DGI) and customs.
</P>
<P>
This suspension came about at a time when DGI has seen itself
involved in a
financial scandal.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the IDB's official made clear it's not about "
anything against nobody." It cannot be signed because of a
technical problem and it will be singed in a short time.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Boy's Father Applies to Come to U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The father of the six-year-old
Cuban boy, Elian Gonzalez, has applied for a visa to travel to the
United States from Cuba to regain custody of his son, the father's
lawyer in the U.S. announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Attorney Gregory Craig said that he submitted
the visa application on behalf of Juan Miguel Gonzalez, his wife
and other family members.
</P>
<P>
"We have also informed the appropriate authorities in the U.S.
government that Mr. Gonzalez is willing to bring his family to the
United States and to remain here during whatever time it takes to
complete the appeals process," the attorney said.
</P>
<P>
However, Gonzalez must have assurances that he will have
custody of Elian during that time, Craig added. "The time has come
for the INS to give Juan Miguel those assurances."
</P>
<P>
Craig urged the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (
INS) to give those assurances today, and to make arrangements with
the State Department to permit Gonzalez and his family to enter
the United States at the earliest possible moment.
</P>
<P>
"The only person that has the legal and moral authority to
speak for Elian Gonzalez is his father," Craig told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Late Wednesday, the INS delayed the deadline for the revocation
of Elian's temporary residency status 24 hours until 9 a.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
Craig also strongly criticized Elian's Miami relatives of
exploiting the boy's case in the media.
</P>
<P>
"The circumstances that now surround Elian's life in Miami,
including the decision to allow camera crews into Elian's bedroom,
the decision to permit a network news program to film a two-day
interview with Elian without the father's permission, and the
decision just last night to parade Elian in front of demonstrators
in the streets of Miami, make it clear that Elian's best interests
lie with his father," Craig said.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the INS ruled that the boy belong to his
father in Cuba and should be returned to Cuba. However, the boy's
relatives in Miami insisted the boy stay with them in the U.S. and
filed a political asylum for the boy.
</P>
<P>
A district judge ruled earlier this month that the Justice
Department has the only right in the case and the INS decision to
return the boy should be respected. Elian's relatives then vowed
to appeal.
</P>
<P>
As the INS resumed discussion with the family over where the
boy should go, the Cuban-Americans are preparing a large protest
and the authorities feared that there might be an unrest in Miami.
</P>
<P>
Elian, who is currently under the custody of his great uncle,
Lazaro Gonzalez, in Florida, was rescued on November 25 last year
from a shipwreck after his mother and 11 others died when the boat
capsized in the sea off Florida.

<HEADLINE> British Queen to Visit N.Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 30 (Xinhua)-- British Queen Elizabeth will make a
one-day visit to Northern Ireland on April 12 to present the
province's police force with Britain's highest civilian award for
bravery, the Northern Ireland Office said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Queen last visited Northern Ireland in 1997.
</P>
<P>
During their day in the province, the Queen and her husband
Prince Philip will attend a reception hosted by Britain's Northern
Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson for a"cross-section of people
from the rural community".
</P>
<P>
The Buckingham Palace's decision last November to honor the
Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) with the George Cross was
immediately slammed as "grossly offensive" by republicans who are
fighting for a united Ireland and see the police force as a
partisan ally of British rule in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Next month's ceremony with the Queen will be only the second
time the George Cross has been awarded collectively, rather than
to an individual.
</P>
<P>
The medal was instituted in 1940 by King George VI and is
awarded for acts of the greatest heroism or courage in extreme
danger.
</P>
<P>
In 1942 it was given to the citizens of Malta for their courage
in resisting German air force bombardments.
</P>
<P>
A peace process for the province is in limbo after Britain
suspended a home-rule government earlier this year when Ulster
Unionists and the republican party Sinn Fein failed to agree on
guerrilla disarmament.

<HEADLINE> 3 Russian Servicemen Killed, 30 Missing in Rebel Ambush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Three Russian special unit
servicemen were killed and another 30 missing in an ambush by
rebels near a south Chechen village Wednesday, the Kremlin said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At around 11 a.m. Moscow time (0700 GMT) Wednesday, 41 riot
police and eight soldiers traveling on two armored personnel
carriers -- a cross country vehicle and a heavy truck -- were
ambushed near Dzhanoi-Vedeno village, said the Kremlin spokesman
on Chechnya Sergei Yastrzhembsky.
</P>
<P>
The presidential aide said the bodies of the servicemen who
died in the attack had not been found and the rest 16 soldiers
were wounded but safe.
</P>
<P>
The Russian military headquarters in Chechnya sent 20 soldiers
in an armored personnel carrier and an armored fighting vehicle (
AFV) to rescue them, but the reinforcement was also ambushed.
</P>
<P>
"The AFV was knocked out of action and 14 people were wounded.
All of them were evacuated," Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
"Helicopters and artillery are working" in the battle area and"
additional forces have been sent there," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russian Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo also confirmed the
reported attack, saying that the command of Interior Troops had
taken appropriate measures and the battle is still continuing.
</P>
<P>
The group of Chechen rebel commander Ruslan Gelayev is believed
to have made the attack.
</P>
<P>
Judging by intercepted radio messages, someone, using the call
sign Angel which is ascribed to Gelayev, coordinated the rebel
actions in Dzhanoi-Vedeno, said the Russian military.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, over 40 rebels were killed and nine captured in
Chechnya on Wednesday and some 80 pieces of firearms were
confiscated, the headquarters of the Russian force in the North
Caucasus said on Thursday, cited by the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters described the situation in Chechnya as
complicated with continuing rebel attacks on federal checkpoints
and military facilities.
</P>
<P>
Also Thursday, Russian deputy Prime Minister and envoy to
Chechnya Nikolai Koshman said direct presidential rule should be
introduced in Chechnya shortly for two years.
</P>
<P>
He said no local elections will be held in Chechnya during that
time and all local leaders will be appointed.
</P>
<P>
"This is necessary to stabilize the situation in the republic,
calm down the public and allow moral wounds to heal," said Koshman,
adding that if elections of district chiefs and the Chechen
leaders are held soon, they will only undermine stability.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Host Conference on Trade of Endangered Species </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Sun Huixia
</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Some 2,000 officials from 147
countries will meet here next month to review the trade bans on
elephants, whales and other endangered species.
</P>
<P>
The 11th conference, to be held from April 10 to 20, of the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild
Fauna and Flora (CITES) will review 62 proposals put forward by
its member states.
</P>
<P>
The proposals cover about 60 groups of species, ranging from
the African elephant and the minke whale to Malagasy poison frogs
and the monkey puzzle tree.
</P>
<P>
The focus will be on whether or not to approve annual sales of
ivory by southern African countries. The international ban on
ivory trade was imposed in 1990 when half of the African
elephants were killed in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
At the last CITES conference, in Harare in 1997, governments
voted to authorize that Botswana, Namibia, and Zimbabwe could
make a one-off and highly controlled experimental sale of
existing ivory stocks to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Together with South Africa, the three countries have proposed a
further authorization for trade in elephant products under strict
control.
</P>
<P>
However, Kenya and India proposed a total ban on such trades,
citing that even the one-time sale of ivory to Japan last year
had increased the cases of poaching greatly.
</P>
<P>
The issue of whales will also be discussed. Japan and Norway
have proposed that the number of gray and minke whales is enough,
so a trade ban on them should be partially lifted due to good
conservation.
</P>
<P>
Similar proposals were rejected by CITES in 1997. All
commercial whaling has been banned by the International Whaling
Commission since 1986.
</P>
<P>
Proposals for resuming a limited trade in Hawksbill turtle
shells are also on the table. Cuba is interested in making a
single, internationally supervised sale to Japan of up to 6,900
kg of shells from existing stocks.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Parties to the Convention will establish a
strategic plan to guide CITES through the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
CITES was adopted in 1973 and came into force in 1975. To date,
147 countries have signed the treaty, making it one of the
world's most important agreements on conservation and sustainable
use of wild animals and plants.

MAPUTO, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African Development
Community (SADC) and the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) will closely cooperate to establish an African Syndicate,
said Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chissano made the remarks at a joint press conference after
meeting with visiting Mali President Alpha Oumar Konare. The two
regional blocs are going to form a working group for coordination,
he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Chissano, SADC and ECOWAS are two regional
groupings with close contact in the African continent, they should
unite together towards the target of achieving an African Union.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two presidents also exchanged views on
bilateral cooperation and the conflicts in the Great Lakes region,
Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
As to bilateral cooperation, Chissano said, the two countries
have decided to enhance the work of the Joint Committee and form
a working group under it to address specific problems.
</P>
<P>
On his side, Konare said that the two countries can cooperate
in a wide range of matters, they can either benefit from
collaboration in agriculture, husbandry and human resources
development, or share experience in how to consolidate peace and
democratic system.
</P>
<P>
Konare arrived here on Thursday for a one-day visit. He left
for South Africa this afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Obasanjo Dismisses Rumor of Luxury Banquet for Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A Spokesman of Nigerian President
Olusegun Obasanjo Thursday clarified that much of the 1.5 billion
naira (15 million US dollars ) proposed expenditure for a
scheduled visit of American President Bill Clinton in June would
go into upgrading the International Conference Center in the
capital.
</P>
<P>
Denying the claim by Senator Arthur Nzeribe that the amount had
been budgeted for a state banquet, the spokesman, Doyin Okupe,
said in a press brief in Abuja, capital of the most populous
African nation that the center, built in 1991, was in a state of
disrepair and needed rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
Senator Nzeribe Tuesday criticized the planned expenditure as "
scandalous," by a country facing serious social and economic
problem.
</P>
<P>
But dismissing this position as "misinformation," Okupe said
Nigeria had a lot to gain from Clinton's visit, which would be the
first by an American president to Nigeria in 22 years after that
of former President Jimmy Carter in 1978.
</P>
<P>
According to Okupe, Clinton was expected to visit Nigeria with
more than 1,000-member delegation, many of them businessmen.
</P>
<P>
After a frosty recent past in the Abuja-Washington relations
under military rule in Nigeria, efforts are being intensified to
restore links to their previous cordial level, with the U.S., as
Nigeria's major trading partner, buying some 40 percent of its
total oil exports.

<HEADLINE> Gaps Between Israel, Syria Not Wide, But Significant -- Ross </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross
said Thursday that the differences over territory between Syria
and Israel is not wide but significant.
</P>
<P>
"If you look at the Israeli-Syrian track, in fact there has
been progress made. The nature of the gaps that exist on that
track are not wide at all," Ross said at a Washington lunch in
honor of former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
"From a practical standpoint, they are not big. From a
psychological standpoint, they remain significant," he added.
</P>
<P>
The gap on territory is abut 100 yards along the eastern shore
of the Sea of Galilee, which Syria demanded that Israel hand over
as an inseparable part of the whole strategic Golan Heights,
captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war. But Israel would not
forgo its control of that strip of land when it prepares to strike
a peace deal with the 52-year-old foe.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton failed to narrow the significant
differences between the two sides during his meeting with Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad in Geneva Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ross said there was good reason for pursuing the U.S. attempt
to mediate an agreement.
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to give up because there's good reason not to
give up," he said.
</P>
<P>
Peres agreed that there was no reason to give up on the Syrian-
Israeli track.

</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached during a nationally-televised debate
Thursday night, just ten days ahead of the country's April 9
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
However, Karamanlis complained that the government led by
Simitis had sent the wrong message to Turkey by its stance at last
December's European Union (EU) summit in Helsinki where it had not
ensured the neighboring country's future respect for international
law and treaties.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leader claimed that Turkish intransigence was
increasing.
</P>
<P>
Simitis disputed this, saying that Turkey was indeed required
to adjust to the acquis commmunautaire and smooth out differences
with its neighbors according to EU treaties, and was expected to
make goodwill gestures.
</P>
<P>
This is the first and last televised debate between the two
political leaders on the eve of the country's elections, the 10th
since the restoration of democracy in Greece in 1974.
</P>
<P>
The Ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) is believed
to win in the elections.

<HEADLINE> Italian Exports in 1999 Down 1.7 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Italian exports dropped 1.7 percent
in 1999 compared to the previous year, with only a handful of
regions, mainly in the depressed south, managing a boost in their
export rates, according to figures released Thursday by the
national statistics bureau Istat.
</P>
<P>
Istat highlighted the continued surge in exports from the
southern region of Basilicata in particular, up an impressive 18.5
percent over 1998.
</P>
<P>
In the second place for export growth was the central region of
Lazio, which posted a jump of 7.3 percent, followed by Sardinia
with a rise of 5.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
But only two northern regions, Trentino Alto Adige and Veneto,
showed a rise of 3.1 percent and 2.8 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
All other regions showed a worrying drop in exports apart from
the regions of Emilia Romagna and Umbria, which remained stable.
</P>
<P>
Istat said that the Basilicata phenomenon had been fueled
mainly by a boom in car sales, while Sardinia had benefited from
increased demand for refined petrol products.

<HEADLINE> UK House Prices Rise In March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Latest figures from the Nationwide
Building Society show house prices in Britain rose 2.3 percent in
March from February, pushing the annual rate up to 16.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
This is the highest increase since 1989, and backs up recent
statistics from other two famous building societies, the Halifax
and the Land Registry.
</P>
<P>
Although prices are rising at their fastest rate in 11 years,
Nationwide said this should be seen in the context of strong
income growth and low unemployment.
</P>
<P>
However, it said that at the current inflation rate, house
prices could rise to unsustainable levels in 12-18 months. A rapid
slowdown could then follow.
</P>
<P>
David Parry of the Nationwide said the Bank of England should
resist calls to increase interest rates in an attempt to take the
heat out of the housing market.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sends More Troops to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen also ordered the Army to send
14 tanks and six 155 mm artillery guns to a 1st Armored Division
company in Skopje, Macedonia as a deterrent, Pentagon spokesman
Kenneth Bacon told a Pentagon briefing.
</P>
<P>
The tanks and artillery headed for Macedonia would provide U.S.
troops there with an extra measure of self-protection, and enable
the troops to conduct their normal training with a full set of
weapons, Bacon added.
</P>
<P>
"It will serve as a deterrent to any mischief that might take
place along the borders of Macedonia," Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
The 125 soldiers are to remain in Kosovo for about six months.
They will work in conjunction with pilotless reconnaissance
aircraft that are being dispatched to improve surveillance along
border areas, Bacon told reporters.
</P>
<P>
An Associated Press report said that the moves reflect a
growing American and NATO concern about the potential for a flare-
up of ethnic violence in the Presevo Valley,a predominantly ethnic
Albanian area adjacent to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
On March 23, the Kosovar Albanian leaders promised to end their
insurgency in southern Serbia. But the promise was broken.
</P>
<P>
The State Department has expressed its disappointment at the
failure of the ethnic Albanians to keep their commitment.

<HEADLINE> German President to Visit Greece and Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, March 30 (Xinhua) -- After his Middle East trip in
February German Federal President Johannes Rau will continue his
visit abroad next week, making an official visit to Greece and
Turkey from April 3 to 8.
</P>
<P>
Former German Federal President Richard von Weizsaecker had
visited the two countries separately in 1987 and 1986.
</P>
<P>
The top aim of Rau's visit to the two countries is to promote
the good-neighborly relations between Greece and Turkey which are
all members of NATO. There were often tensions between the two
countries in the past, but there have been improvements in the
bilateral relations between the two NATO members before long.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey both keep close relations with Germany and
therefore Germany wants to play a role as a pusher and mediator
for their bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
According to director of the general office of the president
Ruediger Frohn, a the focal point of Rau's trip to Greece will be
a visit to Kalavryta. On December 13, 1943, more than 1,200 men
and boys were killed in the mountain village on the Northern
Peloponnesus. Johannes Rau is the first German president to visit
the place which was already forgotten by Germans. Rau will meet
with young people there.
</P>
<P>
Rau's visit to Turkey will be no easy job. In early February
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder canceled his scheduled March
visit to Turkey. There was quarrel between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit in Turkey, Rau will make a speech at the Middle
East Technical University in Ankara, where Rau will be conferred
with the honorary doctor title.
</P>
<P>
The biggest wish of Turkey is to join the European Union as
soon as possible. Rau's visit will promote the process.
