</P>
<P>
By 23:40 (Beijing time) today, nine more bodies had been found

<HEADLINE> Philippine Negotiator Rules out Military Rescue on Hostage Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Chief government negotiator Robert
Aventajado reiterated Saturday that no military or police actions
will be taken to rescue the hostages held by the Muslim extremist
group Abu Sayyaf on the Jolo island in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Such actions would only complicate even more the situation,
Aventajado said, blocking out a police plan to launch a commando-
style rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
Philippine police chief Gen. Panfilo Lacson disclosed on Friday
that he had submitted a recommendation to the cabinet to allow the
police and the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Task Force to
either participate in the hostage negotiations or spearhead
operations to rescue the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado said Lacson should have consulted the negotiating
panel before announcing his plan to rescue the hostages.
</P>
<P>
"He (Lacson) doesn't know the status of the ongoing
negotiations. He should have consulted the panel first before
announcing his plan in order not to alarm the Abu Sayyaf,"
Aventajado said.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf is reportedly holding 37 hostages, of whom 20
mostly foreign hostages taken from neighboring Malaysia, three
captives remaining from a hostage drama in Basilan, 13 Christian
evangelists and a German journalist.
</P>
<P>
Abu Sayyaf gunmen kidnapped nine Malaysians, three Germans, two
French Nationals, two Finns, two South Africans, two Filipinos and
a Lebanese from the Malaysian resort of Sipadan on April 23 and
took them to Jolo, about an hour away by motor boat. One of the
Malaysians was released last month.
</P>
<P>
The rebel also abducted some 50 people, mainly school teachers
and children, in the southern province of Basilan on March 20.
Most of the captives were later released or rescued by government
troops, but six were killed by the rebels. Two school teachers and
one teenage boy now remain in the hands of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The 13 Christian evangelists, belonging to a group called the
Jesus Miracle Crusade led by wilde Almeda, have not returned since
traveling to the rebels' jungle camp in Jolo last week to pray for
the 20 hostages.
</P>
<P>
The German journalist, who has been covering the hostage crisis,
was kidnapped in Jolo last Sunday when he tried to get in touch
with the hostages there.
</P>
<P>
The growing number of captives held by the Abu Sayyaf
complicates the hostage crisis, with reports of quarrels among the
kidnappers over who should receive the largest share of any ransom
payment.
</P>
<P>
The rebel group, which consists of several loosely affiliated
factions, has reportedly demanded one million U.S. dollars for
each hostage.

CAIRO, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Arab Labor Organization (ALO) has
decided to send a team of experts to south Lebanon to study the
impact of Israeli occupation on the economic and social conditions
there, ALO director-general said on Sunday.

the Lebanese government.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iran Expects Friendship Signal from U.S.: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi on Sunday hinted that Tehran is expecting a signal of
friendship from the United States so that the 20 years of hostility
between the two countries can be brought to an end.
</P>
<P>
"We are a great nation and can forget the past if we see a
signal of friendship and sincerity" from the U.S., Kharrazi was
quoted by the official IRNA News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister was speaking in an interview with the
German Der Spiegel news magazine on the eve of President Mohammad
Khatami's three-day visit to Germany.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that Iran will no longer consider the U.S. as "a
great Satan" if it takes sincere steps toward mending relations
with the Islamic republic.
</P>
<P>
"The doors are open for U.S. companies to come to the Iranian
market," he added.
</P>
<P>
This was the second time in two days that Kharrazi called on the
U.S. to change its hostile polices and follow the example of
European countries in developing relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iran's expanding relations with Germany and other European
countries will increase awareness in the U.S. that the it does not
have any choice but to expand ties with Iran, Kharrazi said in a
similar interview on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Iran and the U.S. cut off diplomatic relations after radicals
students stormed into the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took a number
of diplomats hostage in the heyday of the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
The ice between the two sworn enemies began to thaw after
Khatami, a moderate cleric, took office as president in 1997, with
both governments calling for people-to-people contacts.
</P>
<P>
Washington urged for a direct dialog, but Tehran insisted that
Washington must take concrete steps to show its sincerity,
including lifting sanctions and giving up political attacks, before
relations can return to normal.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's interview, Kharrazi said that foreign countries have
adopted a new approach toward Iran and are willing to speed up the
process of normalizing relations with it.
</P>
<P>
President Khatami's visit to Germany at the invitation of German
chancellor Gerhard Schroeder is a clear indication of the new
approach, which Iran welcomes, Kharrazi said, adding that the
visit, starting Monday, is expected to further enhance Iran's
relations with the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the human rights status in Iran, Kharrazi said the
country has made great strides in respecting human rights.
</P>
<P>
No country can say that it respects human rights 100 percent and
in Europe the situation is exactly the same, he said, noting that
what is important is the government's policy and the positive
process in respecting human rights.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the developed nations for adopting double
standards in dealing with human rights and exploiting the issue as
a political leverage against the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The European countries consider certain acts in the developing
countries as violation of human rights while they commit exactly
the same "violation," he pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Syria to Hold Presidential Referendum on Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Over nine million voters of Syria's
total population of 17 million will head for the polling stations
Monday morning to elect Bashar al-Assad president of the republic
just one month after the demise of his father Hafez al-Assad who
ruled the country for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
On June 27, the Syrian People's Assembly unanimously consented
to nominating Bashar, 34, for the presidency and setting July a 10
as the date for the presidential referendum.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the professional syndicates, unions, NGOs, ruling
Socialist Baath Party and Syrian National Progressive Front, which
includes 7 parties, have been organizing rallies for supporting
Bashar.
</P>
<P>
The number of Syrian franchisers hit 9,442,054 and the number of
polling stations reaches 11,185.
</P>
<P>
Polling stations will be open on Monday for receiving voters
from 0700 to 1900 local time. But the deadline may prolong to 2200
local time in case of a heavy turnout.
</P>
<P>
The central leadership of the National Front issued a statement
on Sunday in which it said "Bashar is the leader who can notch up
our people's ambitions and consolidate and buttress our unity. He
is the leader who is so efficient that he can face up to potential
challenges, tide over impediments and mobilize potential."
</P>
<P>
The referendum results will be announced by the People's
Assembly next Tuesday, according to the Syrian News Agency.

WASHINGTON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State

<HEADLINE> S.African President Blames Poverty for Spread of AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 9 (Xinhua) -- South African President Thabo
Mbeki on Sunday blamed poverty for fueling all kinds of
illnesses, including AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Poverty, malnutrition and poor socio-economic conditions were
major contributors to fatal infections and diseases in Africa, he
said at the opening of the five-day 13th International AIDS
Conference in Durban .
</P>
<P>
"We cannot blame everything on a single virus....but poverty is
the underlying cause of reduced life expectancy, handicap,
disability, starvation, mental illness, stress, suicide, family
disintegration and substance abuse," Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
He told thousands of people gathering at Kingsmead Cricket
Stadium that the world's biggest killer and greatest cause of
ill-health and suffering was extreme poverty, and not the HIV/AIDS
pandemic.
</P>
<P>
It is because of poverty, the least developed countries
suffered the heaviest toll of AIDS-related deaths, Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
Quoting World Health Organization (WHO) statistics, he said
each year 12. 2 million children from developing countries under
the age of five died.
</P>
<P>
"They die largely because of world indifference, but mostly
because they are poor."
</P>
<P>
In some of the poorest countries life expectancy was expected
to decrease to 42 years, whereas in the richest countries it was
predicted to reach 79 years by the end of 2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the "extraordinary" gathering of health
experts at the conference would map a plan of action to assist
Africa to "disperse the menacing and frightening clouds" of the
increasing HIV/AIDS pandemic that threatened to destroy people
worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Shas Decides to Quit Barak's Coalition Government EDS-1st lead-writethru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Israel's ultra-Orthodox Shas Party
decided to leave the government and coalition on Sunday, dealing a
heavy blow to Prime Minister Ehud Barak on the eve of his Camp
David summit with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.S.
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference here Sunday, Shas leader and
Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Eli Yishai said that Shas is
carrying out the pullout from the coalition.
</P>
<P>
He said Barak has not set the "red lines" prior to the summit to
the satisfaction of Shas on how far the prime minister is willing
to go and make concessions to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, Shas cannot see itself a full coalition
partner.
</P>
<P>
Yishai said that the leadership of the Council of Torah Sages,
Shas' decision-making body, bore a heavy responsibility for the
future of the peace process, but now cannot be held responsible
without knowing what the "red lines" for the negotiations are.
</P>
<P>
Apparently responding to Barak's pet phrase that he was directly
elected and is responsible for the people, Yishai said it was true
that Barak was elected by the people, but so were the other 119
Knesset (Parliament) members.
</P>
<P>
He said there is nothing more serious than bringing in an
agreement that half of the the Knesset does not support.
</P>
<P>
The resignation of the 17-seat Shas party, together with the
four-seat Yisrael Ba'aliya led by Interior Minister Natan Sharansky
earlier on Sunday and the expected withdrawal of the five-seat
National Religious Party will leave Barak with a crippling 42-78
minority in the 120-member parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, Yishai said, Barak, who has only a few hours before
leaving for the Camp David summit, still has a chance to meet the
coalition heads and to work out an agreement that would accepted by
the people.
</P>
<P>
If Barak returns from the summit with what Shas views as a good
agreement, Shas would support it while outside the coalition, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Shas brought the government to the verge of collapse three weeks
over funding for the its money-strapped school system. It retrieved
its resignation only after Barak promised to meet all their
demands.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Barak dispatched his confidant Minister of
Communication Binyamin Ben Eliezer to the home of Shas' spiritual
leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef to try in a last-ditch effort to dissuade
the Shas leadership from leaving the coalition. His effort has
obviously ended in failure.
</P>
<P>
In a TV interview on Sunday, when asked whether the secular
Shinui Party, which has conditioned its participation in the
government on Shas' withdrawal, will join in the coalition and give
Barak the support he badly needs, Shinui leader Yosef Lapid said "
we will decide tomorrow. The picture is not totally clear."
</P>
<P>
In another serious blow to Barak, Foreign Minister David Levy
decided not to attend the Camp David summit with the prime
minister. Levy has been complaining about Barak's handling of the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Barak explained at the cabinet on Sunday why he could not
outline in detail the "red lines" for the upcoming negotiations. He
said "positively responding to a request to specify the governments
'red lines' in exact detail would be liable to weaken our
negotiating position since their publication would turn them into
opening positions as far as the other side is concerned."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the government's long-held "red lines": no return
to the 1967 lines, a united Jerusalem under Israeli sovereignty, no
foreign army west of the Jordan River, a majority of the Jewish
residents of West Bank and Gaza will remain in settlement blocs,
and no Israeli recognition of legal or moral responsibility for
creating the refugee problem.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also pointed out that "if we reach a
situation in which the world recognizes the borders of the State of
Israel, with Jerusalem as its capital and with 150,000 Jewish
settlers as citizens of the sovereign State of Israel, this will be
a considerable achievement."
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Israeli security cabinet has
authorized Barak to release Palestinians held in Israeli prisoners.
Barak has decided not to release them before the summit.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said Barak would set free some Palestinian
prisoners as good-will gestures ahead of the summit.
</P>
<P>
Barak has already ruled out the possibility of handing over the
Jerusalem area Arab villages prior to the summit, as had been
expected.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians are trying to resolve by a September
13 deadline the most difficult issues of their 52-year-old
conflict, including the status of Jerusalem, borders, water
resources, Palestinian refugees and the future of Jewish
settlements.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Turkish anti-narcotics police
impounded 101.5 kilograms of heroin and 500 grams of cocaine in a
recent operation in Istanbul, the biggest city of the country.
</P>
<P>
The police carried out the operation on July 7, during which
they searched an automobile, discovered the drugs and took two
suspects into custody, Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>

revealed an organized criminal gang which smuggled heroin from
Turkey to Austria.
</P>
<P>
According to information provided by the Turkish police, the
Austrian police confiscated a total of 120 kilograms of heroin in
the Austrian capital of Vienna and captured two suspects.
</P>
<P>
In another operation with the help of the U.S. police, Turkish
anti-drug police seized 500 grams of cocaine which was sent to
Turkey from Colombia and captured nine suspects.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement issued on Saturday, Turkish chief police
authority said the anti-narcotics police have launched "determined
and successful" struggle against illicit drug trafficking via the
country.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued amid some newspapers' criticism that
the police have committed inefficient anti-drug operations.
</P>

In a statement, the police authority summed up its latest
operations and dismissed the criticism "unrealistic and baseless."
</P>
<P>
In 1999, a total of 6,121 suspects were captured in 2,587
separate incidents while anti-drug forces impounded 2,249 kilograms
of heroin, 5,458 kilograms of hashish, 288 kilograms of base

<P>
JERUSALEM, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Despite the collapse of his
coalition government, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said on
Sunday he will attend the Palestinian-Israeli-U.S. summit slated
for July 11 at Camp David near Washington.
</P>
<P>
"Tomorrow I am leaving at the head of the Israeli delegation,
with the feeling of heavy and hard responsibility, to Camp David,"
Barak said in a televised address to the nation.
</P>
<P>
In the address, Barak told the Israeli people that he will try
to reach a framework agreement with the Palestinians on key issues
in the final-status talks but but will maintain national interests
in solving the conflict with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"In the framework of the difficult challenge before us, I intend
to sign only an agreement that will ensure security for the people
of Israel and maintain the red lines of the governments of Israel
which are known to all," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
As Barak prepared for the summit with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton, his coalition government
collapsed on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Right-wing and religious parties quit the coalition one by one,
accusing Barak of keeping them in the dark and being ready to make
too much concessions to the Palestinians without eliciting
compromises from the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
Natan Sharansky, head of a right-leaning Russian immigrant
party, Yisrael Ba'aliya, resigned on Sunday as Interior Minister,
becoming the first coalition partner to turn his back on Barak.
</P>
<P>
Several hours later, the ultra-Orthodox Shas party also decided
to leave the coalition and the National Religious Party, another
coalition partner, decided to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
Barak's coalition now only has 42 seats in the 120-member

<HEADLINE> IMF Chief Cautious About Debt Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Horst Kohler, managing
director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said on Sunday
that simply writing off Africa's debt was not a wise option, as it
may serve as a disincentive for Africans to do something to
improve their own situation.
</P>
<P>
The IMF would not be prescriptive or conditional, but would
"support good policies and give good and candid advice," he told
the South African Broadcasting Corporation's Newsmaker Program.
</P>
<P>
It was important for African countries to invest in education,
health and infrastructural development to prove that they were
committed to handling their own problems, Kohler said.
</P>
<P>
"I would not like to talk about conditionality, I would like to
talk about support for the right policy. What is the right policy
has to be decided by the people and their governments. We give
advice, but I believe we must give honest advice," he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked about steps to increase the representativity of
developing countries on the IMF, Kohler said he was committed to
giving these countries "a better voice".
</P>
<P>
"This is not only just a reallocation of voting rights, but
also better support that the countries can bring their interests
and presentations into the debates of the IMF," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kohler said he would soon be proposing ideas for reforming the
IMF, including ways for it to contribute to poverty alleviation
in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that there was still some degree of pessimism and
cynicism towards Africa among developed countries.
</P>
<P>
"It is partly hidden behind nice rhetoric of help and support
for Africa, " he said.
</P>
<P>
It was therefore imperative for Africans to show that they were
 able to tackle their own problems before leaders of the
international community would be prepared to support the
continent's envisaged economic upsurge, he said.

Health ministers from several of the 14 SADC countries met in
Durban on Sunday to launch the plan. They warned that the threat
of HIV/ AIDS in Southern Africa was severe and could lead to the
socio-economic disintegration of the region where 4 million people
have already died from the virus and 10 million more were
suffering from it.
</P>
<P>
Moses Sichone, chairman of the SADC AIDS Task Force, said it
was important for countries in the region to find solutions of
their own in the fight against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
In order for them to do this they had to take a more regional
approach and use the combined resources the region offered,
experts said.
</P>
<P>
South African Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, who
chaired the Health Sector Committee of SADC Ministers on Sunday,
said cooperation in this regard could lead to regional solidarity
as well as economic and political integration.
</P>
<P>
"As a region we are aware of the seriousness of the disease.
It is a consistent item on the SADC agenda during meetings."
</P>
<P>
According to conference sources, the main objectives of the
multi- sectoral AIDS plan are to reduce and prevent the incidence
of HIV/AIDS among young people and women, to mitigate the
socio-economic impact of the disease, to develop policies aimed
at preventing and controlling transmission and to coordinate
resources for the multi-sectoral response.
</P>
<P>
The document states that dividing the program into the various
sectors would mobilize the region to successfully tackle the
threat.
</P>
<P>
The framework provides for mechanisms to coordinate the use of
resources available from budgets of members states.
</P>
<P>
It involves seven government sectors including health, labor,
trade and industry, culture, information, human resources
development, mining, tourism and sport.
</P>
<P>
For the mining sector, for instance, it would have to monitor
the prevalence of the disease in mines while the labor sector
would have to increase the capacity of government workers and
employees to implement the HIV/AIDS code.
</P>
<P>
The Southern African region registers the highest rate of AIDS
infections. The current extent of the pandemic has affected
virtually every aspect of the lives of the people in the region
and has now reached crisis proportions.
</P>
<P>
Since the mid 1980s there has been a dramatic increase in the
disease and life expectancy in the region has dropped dramatically
to around 40 years.
</P>
<P>
But the region has risen to the challenge, beginning to
mobilize its resources to challenge the mounting threat of the
disease. The latest strategic framework is only among a series of
measures taken by SADC health ministers to combat the disease.
</P>
<P>
However in the eyes of many, the greatest challenge for winning
the war against AIDS was the affordability of drugs.
</P>
<P>
To solve this issue, SADC scientists came together in Nairobi,
Kenya, in June this year to produce an African strategy and find
an African vaccine affordable to AIDS sufferers in the continent.
</P>
<P>
Participants agreed that more affordable drugs would ensure
that money was freed to spend in other health areas. The SADC
governments are also doing their part. According to
Tshabalala-Msimang, the biggest chunk of SADC countries' health
budgets went toward buying drugs.
</P>
<P>
She said pharmaceutical companies had indicated their readiness
to come up with an offer of affordable drugs, but the details were
not yet available.
</P>
<P>
There will also be a number of country-based and sector
specific projects for implementation under the guidance of the
health sector coordinating unit in Pretoria, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Southern Africa is awakening to the alarm of HIV/AIDS, and will
 eventually triumph over the epidemic, a South African health
official said.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Major Armed Group Agrees to Attend Peace Talks for Final Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The elusive peace deal to end
Burundi' s six-year civil war may finally be signed next week as
the main Hutu armed rebel group which has never participated in
the peace talks held in Tanzania's northern town of Arusha has
agreed to attend the talks.
</P>
<P>
The National Council for the Defense of Democracy - Forces for
the Defense of Democracy (CNDD-FDD) has for the first time agreed
to attend the new round of Arusha peace talks beginning on July
19, mediators said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"CNDD-FDD, which has never participated in the talks, has been
the first rebel group to confirm that it will attend the peace
talks," said Mark Bomani, the chief aid of the Burundi peace
mediator, former South African President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
"The leader of CNDD-FDD, Jean Bosco Ndayikengurukiye, has
already confirmed that he will participate in the talks under the
mediation of the facilitator (Nelson Mandela)," said Bomani.
</P>
<P>
Other rebel groups are expected to confirm their participation
in the next couple of days, Bomani noted, adding that all was set
for the signing of the final peace deal.
</P>
<P>
He said the team of mediators will present Mandela with the
revised peace document in Johannesburg, South Africa, on July 10
before he leaves for Arusha next week.
</P>
<P>
In the last round of Arusha peace talks held in February, the
absence of the CNDD-FDD and another key rebel group, the Hutu
People's Liberation Party - the National Liberation Forces
(PALIPEHUTU-FNL) blow away the hope of signing an agreement at
that time.
</P>
<P>
At least 200,000 people, most of them civilians, have died in
fighting between the Tutsi-dominated army and rebels from the
Hutu majority since civil conflict broke out in the tiny central
African country in October of 1993.
</P>
<P>
Mandela took over as mediator last December from late Tanzanian
 President Julius Nyerere and has been trying to speed up the
talks, which have dragged on in Arusha since July 1998.
</P>
<P>
Mandela invited all the Hutu rebel groups that had been
previously excluded to take part in the peace process.
Negotiations over the past two years have worked out the outlines
of a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
The agreement reportedly centers on creating a transitional
government, integrating Hutu rebels into the army, and
establishing an electoral system that will ensure power-sharing
between the minority Tutsis and majority Hutus.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Supports Palestinian Rejection of Compromise on Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Sunday expressed support for
the Palestinians against compromises on issues such as the status
of Jerusalem and the fate of Palestinian refugees at the upcoming
three-way summit.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat met on Sunday to discuss ways of reaching a fair and
comprehensive solution to all the final-status issues, especially
Jerusalem, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters after the talks held at Borg El Arab airport
to the west of the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria that the
holy city of Jerusalem is the main issue that must not be
neglected, delayed or frozen.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is consulting with Arab leaders in the run-up to the Camp
David summit in the U.S. with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
U.S. President Bill Cliton.
</P>
<P>
Moussa added that the summit has been overshadowed by Barak's
government, which has imposed limits on the negotiations, like
rejecting Palestinians' demand for East Jerusalem to be the capital
of their future state.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis have also opposed a return to the borders before
the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
The summit at the presidential Camp David retreat in Maryland is
aimed at pushing the Palestinians and Israel to reach a final peace
agreement by mid-September on settlement of the thorniest issues at
the heart of the half-century Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials close to Arafat, including Planning and
International Cooperation Minister Nabil Shaath, have ruled out any
compromises on Jerusalem and other issues.
</P>
<P>
Shaath said the Palestinians will insist that Israel withdraw to
the borders prior to the 1967 war, and that Jerusalem should return
as the capital of the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
It was at the Camp David in 1978 that Egypt negotiated a peace
deal with Israel, the first between an Arab country and the Jewish
state. Egypt has since played an active role in helping bridge gaps
between the Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived in Cairo Saturday night and the flew to the Borg
El Arab air force base earlier Sunday for talks with Mubarak. He
has left for a summit of the Organization of African Unity to be
held on Monday in Togo.

<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji Starts Visit to Belgium, EU Headquarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji arrived
in Brussels Sunday afternoon, starting his official visit to
Belgium and the European Union Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
At the Brussels international airport, Zhu said in a written
statement that he is happy to visit the Kingdom of Belgium and the
EU headquarters at the invitation of Belgian Prime Minister Guy
Verhofstadt and European Commission President Romano Prodi.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government has all along attached
importance to the relations with Belgium and is willing to develop
long term and stable cooperation with the Kongdom.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, both the two countries have made efforts to
develop such friendly ties on the basis of mutual respect,
equality and mutual benefit, which has already shown good momentum,
deepening understanding, a marked effect in consultation and
cooperation at all levels, and increasingly dynamic exchanges and
cooperation in the fields such as economy and trade, science and
technology as well as education, the Chinese premier said.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of this official visit to Belgium is to upgrade the
good relations between China and Belgium to a new high, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the official visit to the EU headquarters, Zhu said there
has been a good momentum of development in the Sino-EU relations
in recent years. Both China and the EU are important forces in the
international stage, said Zhu, who came here after an official
visit to Italy.
</P>
<P>
"Since there has great and deep changes in international
situation, further enhancement of dialogue and cooperation at the
every level between China and EU is in their basic and long-term
interests and is conducive to maintain peace, stability and
prosperity in the world,"the premier said.
</P>
<P>
Belgium is the last leg of Zhu's six-country European tour.
Before coming here, He had official visits to Bulgaria, Germany,
Luxembourg,the Netherlands and Italy.

<HEADLINE> S. African Presidential AIDS Panel Researches Into HIV Causing AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Earlier some panel members and Mbeki as well expressed
disbelief about the link between HIV and AIDS, drawing much
criticism from the medical field. Mbeki has been under pressure
to clarify his position at the upcoming 13th International AIDS
Conference scheduled to open later in the day.
</P>
<P>
"We are not off the tracks on this issue. The evidence is so
clear-cut, unambiguous and follows the highest rigour of
scientific review, that HIV causes Aids," Makgoba said.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the panel, he said, was to gather all possible
information on the disease, and then provide the government with
rigorously-debated, scientifically-distilled facts.
</P>
<P>
It was for this reason that people with a different
perspective, so- called dissidents who deny a link between HIV and
Aids, have been included, Makgoba said.
</P>
<P>
Makgoba said the work of the panel would help in the
formulation of a national AIDS policy. The government's AIDS
strategy, he said, has been consistent and progressive, but would
become even more aggressive following the finalization of the
panel's work.
</P>
<P>
Makgoba rejected as suspicious an offer by a German
pharmaceutical company to provide South Africa and other
developing countries with the drug Nevirapine -- said to reduce
the risk of mother-to-child HIV infection.
</P>
<P>
"Offers made in public through the media are always fraught
with dangers, " he said.
</P>
<P>
"I don't accept that we should accept such offers. It is easy
for someone to say in public: I'm offering the country this, but
when you look into the details you find that you are going to
actually pay more," he said.

Dalian was put ahead in the 25th minute through Xiaxin guard
Shiyong who cleared a cross by striker Wei Yimin into his own net.
</P>
<P>
About two minute from break Wei was involved in the second goal
again as he caught the defense error to make it two.

<HEADLINE> Chongqing Sends South China Tigers Back Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing Zoo, in southwest China,
recently moved four south China tigers back "home," hoping that
reacquainting them with their native surroundings would improve
their chances to conceive.
</P>
<P>
No south China tigers have been born in the zoo in ten years.
</P>
<P>
Their new home is a "tiger mountain" built by the zoo at a cost
of two million yuan (240,000 U.S. dollars). The mountain has a
simulated natural environment, which is surrounded by bullet-proof
glass walls.
</P>
<P>
Zoo employees said that the four tigers have lived in captivity
for such a long time, they are surprised to see their daily food --
chickens and rabbits -- scampering before their eyes. One of the
tigers was reportedly so scared of the small creatures it ran from
them.
</P>
<P>
Xie Youxin, deputy director of zoo, explained that most of the
south China tigers have difficulty bearing offspring due to their
long-term captivity.
</P>
<P>
An examination of eight of the zoo's male south China tigers
conducted in 1997 revealed that two have no sperm count, one has
inactive sperm, and the rest have low-quality sperm.
</P>
<P>
China now has more than 50 south China tigers which live in 22
zoos, mainly in the four south China tiger breeding bases of
Guangzhou, Shanghai, Chongqing and Hangzhou.
</P>
<P>
The species has been listed as one of the world's ten most
endangered animals.

<HEADLINE> Rare Ethnic Clothing Exhibited in SW Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- A skirt made of six detachable
layers, the shortest of which is a mere 20 cm, is being shown at
the First Chinese Nationalities Costume Exposition in this capital
city of Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
The unique black mini-to-full-length skirt, made by the Miao
nationality in the Leixian County in Guizhou Province of
southwest China, is collected by the Beijing Palace of Ethnic
Culture.
</P>
<P>
He Yanwen, a researcher from the palace, explained that girls
of the Miao nationality in the area prefer to wear only the
shortest layer or layers of the skirt when climbing mountain roads
that call for freedom of movement.
</P>
<P>
More than 50,000 rare dresses and ornaments of 56 Chinese
ethnic groups are on show at the exposition, which is jointly
organized by the State Ethnic Affairs Commission and Yunnan
Provincial People's Government and continues through July 16.
</P>
<P>
Other unusual pieces include a four-meter-wide skirt made of
hand-woven cloth, also from the Miao people. The 50-year-old
garment is in remarkable condition.
</P>
<P>
A skirt with more than 600 pleats hand-made by Yi women,
dresses made of fish skin from people of Hezhe nationality in
northeastern China, and a suit of elephant leather armor, which is
over 600 years old, are included in the show.
</P>
<P>
All ethnic costume are decorated with ornaments. But the most
attractive one is a Tibetan suit for man. The gown of the suit,
made of tiger, leopard and otter fur and equipped with gold
waistband and pearl necklace, takes the owner two hours to wear it.

<HEADLINE> Desert in Northwest China Attracts Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The desert in Shapotou, Zhongwei
County, in northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, has
become a major tourist attraction in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The desert, a natural reserve, is best known for the Baotou-
Lanzhou railway running through it and for sand hills said to
produce unusual sounds.
</P>
<P>
For its achievement in controlling moving sand hills, the spot
was once commended by the United Nations Environment Program.
</P>
<P>
This year, Shapotou is a major attraction for the Ningxia
Desert and Yellow River International Tourism Festival, which
lasts from Saturday until next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The festival has attracted visitors from the U.S, Japan, South
Korea and a dozen other countries.
</P>
<P>
Local tourism officials estimate that as many as 20,000 sight-
seers will visit the Shapotou desert during the six-day event.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The death toll of a Friday bus
accident in Liuzhou, an industrial city in south China's Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region, rose to 78 tonight.
</P>
<P>
Of the 78 bodies, 55 have been identified, including a two-year-
old boy, according to accident investigation authorities.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot determine how many more people are missing as nobody
knew exactly the number of passengers on board the bus," said city
mayor Song Jidong.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred at about 10 p.m. Friday when the bus
veered off a bridge and plunged 27.1 meters into the Liujiang
River.
</P>
<P>
The bus fell into the river after it made a sharp left turn in
the center of the Hudong bridge and slammed into the bridge
abutment, according to witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Regional and the Ministry of Construction officials rushed to
the spot to supervise the rescue. An investigation team has been
set up, headed by the regional chairman Li Zhaozhuo.
</P>
<P>
By press time, a rescue team made up of over 700 people were
still searching for accident victims along the river, joined by
300 soldiers stationed in Liuzhou.

<HEADLINE> URGENT Shas Decides to Quit Barak's Coalition Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Israel's ultra-Orthodox Shas Party
decided to leave the government and coalition on Sunday, dealing a
heavy blow to Prime Minister Ehud Barak on the eve of his Camp
David summit with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.S.
President Bill Clinton on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference here on Sunday, Shas leader and
Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Eli Yishai said that his party
is carrying out the pullout from the coalition.
</P>
<P>
He said Barak has not set "red lines" prior to the summit to the
satisfaction of the party on how far the prime minister is willing
to go and make concessions to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, Shas cannot see itself a full coalition
partner.

<HEADLINE> Israeli PM Reiterates Red Lines in Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
Sunday reiterated his government's red lines in the upcoming Camp
David Summit, voicing his confidence that once an agreement is
struck, it will be ratified by an overwhelming majority of the
population.
</P>
<P>
Barak was speaking at a weekly cabinet meeting, at which he
reviewed the preparations for the summit and elaborated on the main
issues on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
He said the Israeli government's red lines are clear: no return
to the 1967 lines, a united Jerusalem under Israeli sovereignty, no
foreign army west of the Jordan River, a majority of the Jewish
residents of West Bank and Gaza to remain in settlement blocs, and
no Israeli recognition of legal or moral responsibility for
creating the refugee problem.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that along with the great risks, the government is
aware of the great responsibility entailed in not achieving an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister reiterated his confidence that if an
agreement is achieved, it will be ratified by an overwhelming
popular majority.
</P>
<P>
Barak emphasized that the Israeli team at Camp David will face a
historic responsibility and an important test, adding he will not
sign any agreement which does not strengthen Israel.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that "if we reach a situation in which the world
recognizes the borders of the State of Israel, with Jerusalem as
its capital and with 150,000 Jewish settlers as citizens of the
sovereign State of Israel, this will be a considerable
achievement."
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Barak's media adviser said that in addition to
the official delegation to the peace talks in the U.S., the prime
minister has decided to dispatch an information team which will
operate in Washington and New York.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Jewish Society and World Jewish Affairs Rabbi
Michael Melchior and Minister of Immigrant Absorption Yuli Tamir
will leave Sunday night, while other senior officials will be
leaving in the coming days to join the information effort. The
focus of their efforts will be the U.S. public opinion and the
world media.
</P>
<P>
Sharansky, leader of the four-seat Yisrael Ba'aliya Party,
submitted his letter of resignation to Barak Sunday, citing his
inability to influence the negotiations with the Palestinians in
the coalition. He again called for the forming of a national unity
government on the eve of Barak's departure for the three-way summit
with Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat and U.S.
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The other right-wing party in the coalition, the National
Religious Party, has also threatened to quit the government. The
party is convening Sunday afternoon to endorse the pullout.
</P>
<P>
The party's leader and Minister of Housing and Construction
Yitzhak Levy is expected to make it official on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The NRP is backed by Jewish settlers in the West Bank, and it is
opposed to all territorial concessions to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The departure of Sharansky's party, along with the expected
resignation of the five-seat NRP, will leave Barak with a shaky 59-
61 minority in the 120-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
The 17-seat ultra-Orthodox Shas party, demanding a more
prominent peacemaking role, is also considering resignation barely
three weeks after bringing the government to the verge of collapse
over funding for its education system.
</P>
<P>
Shas Chair Eli Yishai has decided not to attend the Camp David
summit with Barak. The party leadership is meeting the party
spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef Sunday afternoon to decide
whether to carry out the threats to quit the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians are trying to resolve by a September
13 deadline the most difficult issues of their 52-year-old
conflict, including the status of Jerusalem, borders, water
resources, Palestinian refugees and the future of Jewish
settlements.

<HEADLINE> SADC Launches Anti-AIDS Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) on Sunday launched its HIV/ AIDS
strategic framework in a bid to strengthen the region's fight
against the disease.
</P>
<P>
The plan, launched prior to the 13th International AIDS
Conference which starts in Durban later Sunday, was developed
under the leadership of SADC health ministers and comprised of
seven governmental sectors including health, labor and trade and
industry.
</P>
<P>
While launching the plan at a satellite conference of SADC
health ministers at Durban's International Convention Centre
(ICC), South African Health Minister Manto Tshabala-Msimang called
for regional cooperation in fighting the disease which she said
could also lead to regional solidarity as well as economic and
political integration.
</P>
<P>
"As a region we are aware of the seriousness of the disease. It
is a consistent item on the SADC agenda during meetings," she
said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the virus, which was already affecting
millions of people in the region, could become a threat to
economic stability.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the main stumbling block was the
affordability of drugs.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the SADC countries' health budgets go towards drugs,"
she said.

<HEADLINE> S. African Medical Group Calls for Medicine Price Control Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Pharmaceutical Society of
South Africa (PSSA) on Sunday stressed the necessity of imposing a
stricter control over the prices of medicines, particularly those
used to treat HIV/ AIDS-related ailments.
</P>
<P>
"Pharmacists, as part of the health care team, have an
important role to fulfil in managing HIV/AIDS and delivering
essential pharmaceutical services, but are currently being
hampered in their task through discriminatory pricing practices,"
President of the PSSA Keith Johnson said in a statement issued
here.
</P>
<P>
Unfair discrimination to a large extent existed in various
parts of Africa where in some cases people were paying more for
AIDS drugs than developed countries, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
Even countries on almost the same development level as African
countries, got their drugs at a more affordable price, he claimed.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from the United States, South Africa is the only other
country where there is no price control on medicine. Possibly due
to the lack of price control, the USA has the highest level of
medicine inflation in the world, with South Africa hot on its
heels," he said.
</P>
<P>
The PSSA was concerned about the price difference between South
Africa and other countries because pharmacists were often blamed
for the exorbitant prices of drugs, according to Johnson.
</P>
<P>
Johnson said pharmacists had no choice but to obtain drugs at
an inflated price.
</P>
<P>
"The PSSA is not making an attempt to cut into profits of the
pharmaceutical manufacturers and agrees that pharmaceutical
profits drive research, but it would like to see the issue of
opportunistic pricing structures addressed and resolved," he said.

<HEADLINE> Africa Needs More Aid to Fight AIDS: UNAIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The African continent,
staggering under heavy debts, was in need of about 3 billion U.S.
dollars every year for basic AIDS prevention and treatment, United
Nations AIDS project (UNAIDS) director Peter Piot said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The money Africa spent on debt repayment far exceeded that
spent on health and education, he told the South African
Broadcasting Corporation's Newsmaker program, adding that Africa
was forking out about 15 billion dollars annually for foreign
debt.
</P>
<P>
Referring to ongoing discussions to relieve the continent's
debt burden, Piot said it was important that money be freed up and
be diverted to the fight against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"It is about the survival of the whole continent," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Piot said it was up to African countries to identify their own
AIDS programs before UNAIDS could consider monetary assistance.
</P>
<P>
The legacies of colonialism and apartheid had much to do with
the fact that southern Africa was the part of the world worst
affected by the disease, he said.
</P>
<P>
This has resulted in disparities in society and extensive labor
 migration which are major factors to the spread of the virus.
</P>
<P>
Piot stressed that AIDS could be brought under control with the
right preventative actions, saying: "We are not powerless". Most
important thing in combating the scourge was proper sex education
and stigmatizing the disease.
</P>
<P>
He cited as examples the African countries of Uganda, Zambia
and Senegal which have succeeded in reducing their infection
rates by creating more openness about AIDS, and making sure that
those who revealed their infections were not discriminated
against.
</P>
<P>
Piot also expressed satisfaction that there appeared to be
increasing international solidarity around fighting the disease.
Developed nations and organizations such as the U.N. were making
available more and more funding for AIDS programs in poorer
countries, while four years ago the level of support amounted to
next to nothing.
</P>
<P>
He also welcomed increasing political involvement in fighting
the scourge, but stressed that everything being done to combat
AIDS should be based on sound scientific grounds.

<HEADLINE> Waldmann Stages Amazing Comeback for 250cc Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Ralf Waldmann battled from
behind to snatch 250cc victory at the British motorcyling Grand
Prix on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Early in the 27-lap race, the 34-year-old Waldmann, with full
wet weather tyres on his Aprilia, was way down the field but went
faster and faster as the rain intensified.
</P>
<P>
His comeback sent him within sight of the Yamaha of France's
Olivier Jacque, who had led from pole and all but a few meters of
the 108.54-km race, on the final lap before he eased past him on
the final curve before the flag.
</P>
<P>
Jacque finished second, 0.344 seconds behind Waldmann's winning
time of 49 minutes 41.073 seconds. Japan's Naoki Matsudo placed
third on a Yamaha in 49:42.682.
</P>
<P>
The Frenchman at least had the consolation of taking over the
lead in the world championship standings. Jacque now has 160
points to Shinya Nakano's 153.

<HEADLINE> China's Ancient Inventions Recorded at Dunhuang Grottoes (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DUNHUANG (GANSU), July 9 (Xinhua) -- Frescoes and other
cultural objects unearthed from China's Magao Grottoes provide
evidence that China led the world in scientific and technological
development before modern science appeared in the West at the end
of 18th century.
</P>
<P>
The honeycomb of caves known as the Mogao Grottoes, in Dunhuang
city of Gansu Province in the northwest, are etched into the steep
cliff at the foot of Mingsha Mountain. Inside the caves are tens
of thousands of ancient documents, Buddhist sutras and murals
dating back to the 4th through 11th centuries.
</P>
<P>
The art of printing, which has helped to advance human
civilization, is known to have originated in China. The ingenuity
of the ancient Chinese is apparent at Dunhuang.
</P>
<P>
The Diamond Sutra in the caves is a Buddhist scripture printed
in 68 A.D. "Words on the sutra are still clearly seen and thick.
It suggests that the art of wood-block printing during the Tang
Dynasty (618-907) was quite mature," said Wang Jinyu, a researcher
of the Dunhuang Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
The wooden movable type in the Uyghur language, recently found
at the northern part of the grottoes, is believed to be the
earliest block printing preserved in the world. It is thought to
be 200-300 years older than the movable type printing invented by
Johannes Gutenberg in Europe in the 15th century.
</P>
<P>
"Dunhuang provides ample material for the conclusion that the
printing technique created by the Chinese was taken to the West
along the ancient Silk Road," said Wang.
</P>
<P>
Fan Jinshi, president of the Dunhuang Research Institute,
described the ancient Chinese documents kept for seven successive
centuries in the grottoes as a complete record of the history of
paper-making in China.
</P>
<P>
"We've found in the caves a kind of worm-resistant yellow paper
made in the Tang Dynasty (618-907) and paper made by using waste
paper as raw materials," she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
The cultural objects found at Dunhuang provide a bounty of
riches not only for the study of politics, economy, culture,
religion and arts in ancient China but also for the research of
science and technology used at the time.
</P>
<P>
Professor Joseph Needham of Britain based his book "The Science
and Civilization in China" in part on materials found at Dunhuang.
</P>
<P>
When talking about ancient scientific development in China, he
said that China's inventions of gunpowder, the compass, paper and
printing had been widely acknowledged in the world, but people
still don't know much about other significant Chinese inventions.
</P>
<P>
Needham noted that suits of armor used for protecting horses in
battle can be seen in a fresco at the Mogao Grottoes, however,
they appeared 1,000 years after the fresco was made.
</P>
<P>
The crank shaft plough, hand-driven mill, one-wheel cart, wine
steamer and firelock appearing in Dunhuang frescoes all
demonstrate that ancient China had achieved amazing development in
some aspects of science and technology, Wang Jinyu said.
</P>
<P>
In the period from the Qin Dynasty (221-206 B.C.) to the
Northern and Southern Dynasties (420-550), China had developed
relatively complete systems of mathematics, astronomy, medical
science, agriculture, metallurgy, textile, chemistry, architecture
and communications. Sino-overseas scientific and cultural
exchanges through the Silk Road in succeeding Tang and Song
dynasties brought China into a flourishing age, he added.

<HEADLINE> Businessmen Benefit from China's College Exam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- This month is usually called "black
July" by senior high school graduates who take part in the annual
college entrance exam. But for smart businesspeople, July is a
good time to make money.
</P>
<P>
The Yuebinlou Mansion of the Beijing Friendship Hotel
registered more than 130 guests on July 7, the first day of this
year's college and university entrance examinations. All of them
are exam participants needing a cool, quiet room for some last-
minute cramming.
</P>
<P>
Excited Li Minghui, who is in charge of the hotel's public
relations and sales, said that "July used to be a slack season for
us, it is a rare thing that so many people have come to live here.
"
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Friendship Hotel advertised discounts on
apartments especially for senior middle school students who were
preparing for the entrance exam. Located in an area with many
middle schools, the hotel became the first choice of many
examinees.
</P>
<P>
In nearby Yanshan Grand Hotel, exam takers can book a room for
noon break, for a modest 88 yuan (10.6 U.S. dollars) per hour.
</P>
<P>
A total of 3.88 million Chinese students sat for the college
and university entrance examinations this year, 485,000 more than
last year. The number of students taking the exam in Beijing
stands at 65,000.
</P>
<P>
In addition to hotel rooms, health care products have sold well
in Beijing recently. In the past month, the sales volume of
health care medicines and tonic rose by about 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some exam takers are turning to oxygen bars and
psychological consultation for assistance through these stressful
days.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Says Goodbye to State-Owned Medium, Small Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- State and collectively-owned medium
and small enterprises will not exist in Beijing three years from
now, according to Beijing vice-mayor Liu Haiyan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a recent conference here on the reform of medium
and small-enterprises, Liu said the capital city is determined to
lead other Chinese cities in the change.
</P>
<P>
As part of the reform, these enterprises will take on diverse
forms of ownership, from corporate to individual as well as
employee ownership.
</P>
<P>
The government will withdraw from the management of the
enterprises and will no longer be responsible for them, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
The official emphasized that the ownership reform would be
carried out in all these enterprises, whether or not they are
making profit, as it is the government's intention to remove state
and collectively-owned assets from competitive sectors.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, Beijing had about 14,000 medium
and small enterprises by the end of 1999, which produced 41.5
billion yuan in industrial added-value, or 65 percent of the
figure for Beijing as a whole.

<HEADLINE> 1stlead: Philippine Military Takes Moro Headquarters EDS: Updates with Details </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
declared that the military overran the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front's (MILF) headquarters Camp Abubakar in the southern island
of Mindanao on Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
The capture of Camp Abubakar, which took place at around 11 a.m.
Sunday, will speed up government efforts to bring genuine and
lasting peace and development in Mindanao, Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
He said government soldiers have seized major structures inside
the camp, including the armory where the retreating MILF fighters
left huge cache of arms and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar reportedly rests on a 10,000-hectare territory in
Matanog in the province of Maguindanao, housing six Muslim
communities in the area as well as the residences of MILF leaders
led by Chairman Hashim Salamat. Several military and civilian
facilities are also said to be inside the camp.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said government troops are now consolidating forces,
setting upperimeter security around the camp, and checking for
landmines left by MILF fighters who abandoned their stronghold.
</P>
<P>
Eight soldiers were killed during the offensive while 37 others
were wounded, according to the president.
</P>
<P>
He said Gen. Angelo Reyes, chief of staff of the Armed Forces
of the Philippines, reported to him that MILF resistance was
contrary to its earlier pronouncement that its fighters will
defend Camp Abubakar at all cost.
</P>
<P>
With Camp Abubakar now in government hands, the president said
his administration can move with more speed in transforming
Mindanao into a progressive economic center.
</P>
<P>
"With this development, we can look forward to faster
government efforts to give Mindanaons the quality of life they
long deserve," he said.
</P>
<P>
The military began launching attacks on Camp Abubakar after the
MILF failed to meet a June 30 deadline set by President Estrada to
sign an interim peace deal with the government and rejected
government demands to abandon its bid for independence and stop
terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
Some 6,000 soldiers reportedly had been deployed to take the
camp, supported by dozens of armored vehicles, Howitzers, bomber
aircraft and attack helicopters.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Air Force light bombers and helicopter gunships
alternately conduct daily airstrikes on rebel positions in the
past week to soften the defenses around the camp.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada ordered the military on Friday to arrest top
MILF leaders once Camp Abubakar is overrun, saying that "They
should be captured because they are challenging the sovereignty of
this country."
</P>
<P>
The 15,000-strong MILF, which has been fighting for an
independent Islamic state in Mindanao, threatened earlier to
retaliate if the government forces continue to attack Camp
Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts between government troops and MILF fighters have
reportedly displaced at least 500,000 civilians since late April
when the military launched attacks on rebel encampments along the
Narciso Ramos Highway in Maguindanao.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Explore Market of Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 9 (Xinhua) -- About 44 Turkish textile companies
have made a debut at a series of exhibitions named "Made in
Turkey" being held here with an aim to explore the new market of
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Between July 7 to August 20, there are a total of seven
different exhibitions displaying Turkish products, Turkel Fair
Organization director Bulent Erten said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The first week of the exhibitions will mainly focus on
garments. In the next six weeks, the themes of the exhibitions
will be machinery, food, electronics, household goods, hotel
equipment, and cosmetic goods respectively.
</P>
<P>
The fashion models from Turkey performed on a T-stage in the
exhibition hall for visitors in the past three days.
</P>
<P>
"It is the first of such kind of exhibition. Over the past
three days, the textile and shoes exhibition has attracted about
10,000 visitors," Erten said.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that Turkish goods have a good edge in
competition with their high quality and low prices," he said.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, co-sponsored by the Turkish government and
Turkel Fair Organization, will be a good beginning for the Turkish
industry sector to export their goods to Africa, Erten stressed.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Price Hike Triggers Price Rise for Consumer Items in Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- A fuel price hike, which began
last Monday in Ethiopia, has forced its businessmen to raise
prices of a series of consumer items including staple food teff.
</P>
<P>
Taking effect on July 4, the price of regular petrol rose by
28.5 percent to 3.97 birr (one U.S. dollar equals 8.22 birr) per
liter. The price of diesel oil rose by 11.1 percent to 2.20 birr
per liter, and the price of kerosene by 12.9 percent to 1.75 birr
per liter.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Commerce and Industry said that the fuel price
 adjustment, the second of its kind since last December, was
promoted by the price hike to the high cost of crude oil on the
world market.
</P>
<P>
The next price adjustments will be made within three months,
corresponding to the world price of crude oil, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The fuel price hike in Ethiopia has immediately led to the
increase of the cost of common foodstuff such as teff, a staple
food for Ethiopians, after the announcement of the readjustment
on the retail prices of fuel products.
</P>
<P>
The retails prices for first-grade teff was 320 birr per
quintal one week ago. It now sells for 335 birr, an increment of
15 birr.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the rise in prices was the increase of
suppliers' transportation costs, some grains merchants said.
</P>
<P>
However, most of the trades said that they had not purchased
new stock after the new fuel price adjustment took effect. They
said they increased their prices in anticipation of an increase in
freight rates in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The rise in fuel products has also led to increased taxi fares.
 Although the short distance fare has increased from 50 Ethiopian
cents to 55 cents and the long distance from 85 cents to 95 cents,
taxi drivers still complained that the fuel price hike had caused
a decline in their daily income.
</P>
<P>
In the past, a five-seat taxi driver earned an average of 40
birr daily, but now they earn an average of 25 birr, a taxi
driver said.

MOSCOW, July 9 (Xinhua) -- At least two people were killed and
17 others wounded on Sunday in a bomb explosion at the center of
Russia's south city of Vladikavkaz, capital of the North Ossetia
Republic, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The blast took place near the city's central market. The bomb
was filled with pieces of wire, which caused many people to suffer
injuries, mostly on the legs and arms, Interfax quoted North
Ossetian Interior Minister Kazbek Dzantiyev as saying.

</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency set the casualties of the blast at
three persons killed and seven wounded, calling the incident "an
terrorist act."
</P>
<P>

handbag and planted under a car parked in a square near the market,
at 11:15 a.m. Moscow time (0815 GMT), Itar-Tass cited the North
Ossetian Interior Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>

explosion in the same market on March 19, 1999, which killed 52
people and wounded some 200, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Also on Sunday, one person was killed and two others were
wounded by a bomb explosion in the central supermarket of Russia's
south European city Rostov-on-Donorning.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang to Raise More Locust-Killing Fowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region has decided to battle this year's onslaught of
crop-eating locusts with the big guns: chickens and ducks.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, over 700,000 of the train-to-eat-locust fowl
have been credited for killing a substantial proportion of the
insects that threatened farmland in one of the region's worst
plagues of the pest in years.
</P>
<P>
Regional officials have decided to raise at least 200,000 ducks
next year, double the number bred for this year, and also will
arrange for more chickens to be hatched.
</P>
<P>
One duck can eat up to 400 locusts a day, twice as many as a
chicken, according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang and some other parts of China witnessed the most
serious locust disaster this year with 2.6 million hectares of
land attacked by the insects.
</P>
<P>
The central and local governments have spent over 35 million
yuan (4.2 million dollars) on pest-control chemicals and equipment,
and said the situation is basically under control in most parts of
China.
</P>
<P>
Two pilots on a pesticide-spraying mission over Xinjiang died
in an air crash late last month.

<P>
He pointed out that with its long neck and thin, flat beak, a
duck acts as a sort of forklift, and can consume up to 400 locusts
a day.
</P>
<P>
Ma's ducks have two locust dinners per day, before dawn and
after dusk, and can eat twice as many locusts as a chicken.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Ma said, he saves up to 70 percent on feed costs now
that his ducks are eating the high-protein locusts, and they will
get a higher price on the market after he retires them from pest-
control duty.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Long, a locust-killing expert from China Agricultural
University, said the bio-methods are also of great importance for
achieving biological balance and encouraging sustainable
development of agriculture and animal husbandry.

<P>
URUMQI, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Twice a day, over 700,000 trained
chickens and ducks chow down on locusts at the foot of Tianshan
Mountain in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Xinchun, deputy head of Xinjiang's Pest Extermination
Office, said that by nightfall, the chicken-duck troops can devour
nearly 100 million locusts, making a welcome dent in one of the
region's worst locust plagues in years.
</P>
<P>
Locusts have affected 2.6 million hectares of farmland in the
northwest China region, Zhao said. To fight back, the region has
brought in some 100,000 ducks to join the locust-killing bio-
troops made up of chickens, migrating starlings and microspores.
</P>
<P>
The bio-troops have helped kill locusts on over 270,000
hectares of land and the region has decided to double its number
of ducks and chickens for its fight against the locusts next year.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Ministry of Agriculture said locusts have
attacked about 2.6 million hectares land nationwide.
</P>
<P>
In some areas, one square meter of land was home to as many as
10,000 locusts.
</P>
<P>
The central and local governments have spent over 35 million
yuan (about 4.2 million dollars) on pest-control chemicals and
equipment and the situation is basically under control in most
areas, according to sources from the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Ma Yonggang, a herdsman on the northern side of Tianshan
Mountain, is breeding 5,000 locust-killing brown ducks.

<P>
CAIRO, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are the economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt's trade deficit during the first three months
this year went down about 431 million U.S. dollars compared to the
same period in l999, according to Arabic daily Al-Alam Al-Youm on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The decline was attributed to the growth in exports from 1.13
billion dollars during the January-March period last year to about
1.137 billion dollars in the first quarter in 2000, the economic
daily reported quoting the monthly release of the Egyptian Economy
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The non-oil exports rose 84 million dollars to 672 million
dollars from the figures of the first quarter last year, the
release pointed out. Meanwhile, oil exports slightly went up from
422 million dollars to 462 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Imports declined 207 million dollars from 3,805 million dollars
early l999 to 3,498 million dollars by March 2000, according to the

report.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- Saudi Al-Faisalyia Group is expected to bring to the
market its first batch of personal computer (PC) sets manufactured
at the group's factory in Riyadh, local Iktsadyia daily reported on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The economic paper quoted the Faisalyia Group Chairman Mohammad
Al-Ureifi as saying that launching the new product was a "major
step allowing Saudi Arabia to join the countries advanced in PC
making, maintenance and operation.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Jordan decreed anti-dumping tariff as high as 300
percent
on each kilogram of chocolate and biscuit coming from Egypt for 200
days on, according to Egyptian daily Al-Alam Al-Youm on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted Chief of the Subsidy and Dumping Control
Department under the Egyptian Economy Ministry, Abdul-Rahman Fauzy,

as saying that his ministry has asked the Jordanian Trade Ministry
to
reconsider the decision.
</P>
<P>
However, Jordan's Trade Ministry replied that the move was not
designed against the chocolate imports only from Egypt but covered
all such imports from foreign market in view of their negative
impact on similar national industry, the report said.
</P>
<P>
TUNIS -- Tunisian exports in the January-April period in 2000
rose
17.7 percent to 2658.4 million Tunisian dinars (one U.S. dollars
equals to 1.33 dinars) against 2259.3 million dinars in the same
months last year.
</P>
<P>
Figures disclosed by the Tunisian Export Promotion Center said
imports also jumped 22.4 percent from 3104.6 million dinars to
3800.9 million dinars in the respective period.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Companies Try to Involve in Ethiopian Power Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- At least two international
companies have expressed interest in investing in multi-million
U.S. dollar power generation projects in Ethiopia, the Fortune
weekly reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Cal Tech International of the United States is trying to form a
sales agreement with the Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation
(EEPCO) to invest up to 350 million dollars to generate 350
megawatts of hydroelectric power.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an Italian company, Enerco Private Limited Company,
is also negotiating with the EEPCO to secure a deal between 30
million and 40 million dollars to generate 25 mw hydro or thermal
power, the weekly said.
</P>
<P>
The international interest in making investment in the
Ethiopian power industry comes out when the Horn of Africa
country is falling into an unprecedented power crisis resulted
from the shortage of rainfall.
</P>
<P>
To avoid the breaking down of the total power system, the EEPCO
has to implement rationing program since April.
</P>
<P>
Frequent power cuts have caused considerable economic losses to
many business in the country.

WASHINGTON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- A flight test of the proposed National Missile Defense
system failed early Sunday morning when the intercepter missile
tumbled out of control, cutting short the exercise before it could
provide critical information for U.S. President Clinton's
impending decision on whether to start building the missile shield,
Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
-- Russian military leaders seized on Sunday's failure of a U.S.
missile defense flight test to urge Washington to abandon the
program, while Washington's European allies breathed a sigh of
relief and quietly expressed hope that the misfire would delay the
controversial U.S. efforts.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Russian President Vladimir V. Putin assembled both houses of
Parliament and a national television audience to present a glum
assessment of the state of the nation. It was notable for his
emphatic and, at some points, seemingly emotional commitment to
building a democracy.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Vice President Al Gore is seeking to tie Texas Governor
George W. Bush tightly to the Republican-led Congress and blame
him for the legislative stalemate on major issues.

<HEADLINE> China to Increase Coal Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- China plans to increase coal
exports to about 50 million tons this year from 39 million tons in
1999 to help relax uphill oversupply in the domestic market and
rescue debt-ridden coal mines, the China Daily Business Weekly
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The China National Coal Import and Export (Group) Corp. (CNCIEC)
, which now has a majority share in the nation's total coal export,
is being urged to sell 35 million tons of coal abroad in 2000, a
CNCIEC official told the weekly.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government has so far approved four Chinese
companies to handle coal export. Besides CNCIEC, the other three
are the China National Minerals and Metals Import &AMP; Export (Group)
Corp, the Shanxi Provincial Coal Import &AMP; Export Co, and the
Shenhua Group, a giant conglomerate based on Shenfu-Dongsheng
Coal Mine, located in northern Shaanxi Province and part of Inner
Mongolia. The three firms are expected to export a total of 15
million tons of coal this year, official sources indicated.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months this year, China exported a total of
20.94 million tons of coal, or 42 percent of its target, official
statistics showed. The CNCIEC sold 13.28 million tons in the
January-May period, 1.2 million tons more than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also showed that the export of the other three
companies totaled 7.66 million tons in the first five months, a
jump of 5.35 million tons on a year-on-year basis.
</P>
<P>
As the world's largest coal producer, China currently produce
around 1 billion tons of coal annually, almost one-third of the
world's total. However, China's export of coal only makes up
approximately 8 percent of the world's total trade volume.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Appeals Court Upholds Execution of Iraqi Puppet Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 9 (Xinhua) -- A Kuwaiti appeals court on
Sunday
upheld the death sentence against Alaa Hussein who headed the
puppet regime of Kuwait at the start of Iraq's 1990-1991
occupation.
</P>
<P>
Hussein, 41, was first sentenced to death in absentia in 1993.
The
sentence was upheld by the criminal court on May 3 following his
return to Kuwait from exile in Norway in January.
</P>
<P>
Hussein, a former Kuwaiti colonel, argued that he was forced to
lead the puppet government handpicked by Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein after the occupation of Kuwait. His government lasted only
about a week after the invasion. Saddam later annexed Kuwait and
declared it an Iraqi governorate before the Iraqi forces were
defeated in the following Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
Hussein claimed that the Kuwaiti government had promised to
pardon him before he returned home from exile, but Kuwaiti
Information Minister Saad bin Teflah denied the claim.
</P>
<P>
Hessein's lawyer Nawaf Sari told reporters that he would appeal
the verdict in the cassation court, the last stage in the legal
process.
</P>
<P>
"We respect the judiciary but I think he should have been
treated like the eight members of his cabinet," against whom
charges
were not pressed, Sari said.
</P>
<P>
Any death sentence passed by the cassation court must be
approved by the ruling emir, Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, who
has the power to commute the penalty, which is carried out by
hanging in the
Gulf Arab state.

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM Not to Attend Three-Way Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy has decided not to participate in the three-way summit slated
for next Tuesday at Camp David, near Washington, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Levy informed Prime Minister Ehud Barak about his decision on
Sunday when the two met to formulate Israel's position regarding
peace talks with the Palestinians at the summit, which will discuss
the key issues in Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks and try to
reach a framework agreement on those issues.
</P>
<P>
The key issues include the fate of Jerusalem, border, refugees,
settlements and water.
</P>
<P>
Levy, whose Gesher (bridge) party faction joined Barak's One
Israel party after elections in May in 1999, has been fighting for
a national unity government before reaching a peace agreement with
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Levy did not promise Barak whether he will back the Prime
Minster to reach a framework agreement with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The summit will be attended by Barak, Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton, who intends to make "100
percent of an effort" to ensure that the summit leads to a deal
between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
But, a senior Palestinian source told the local daily the
Jerusalem Post on Sunday that the Americans have formulated ideas
to present at the summit, including the possible postponement of
the issues of Jerusalem and the return of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leadership may soften its opposition to such a
postponement if the U.S. backs up its plan either with other
concessions from Israel or with a pledge to provide assistance,
such as U.S. troops to help police the border between the
Palestinian state and Israel, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Shas leader Eli Yishai said on Sunday that Barak's words on
Israel's negotiation stance with the Palestinians are not
convinced.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after his meeting with Barak, who will head
the Israeli delegation to the Camp David summit, Yishai said that
he was not convinced by Barak's explanation about the "red lines"
that he will not cross over during the peace talks with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Yishai refused to disclose the details about the "red lines",
but said he has not yet decided whether or not to quit the
coalition.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Barak, Yishai went to consult with Shas party
spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef in order to further formulating
the party's position regarding the upcoming summit.
</P>
<P>
Yishai has been asking Barak for months to include him in the
peace process, while Barak turned a deaf ear. This time Yishai
refused to go to the summit with Barak and be a member of the
Israeli delegation, demanding Barak to negotiate with Shas over
the "red lines" before he leaves to negotiate with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The support of Shas, which has 17 members of the 120-member
Knesset (parliament), is vital for Barak to reach any peace
agreement with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In preparation of the summit, Barak is holding a meeting of his
security cabinet Sunday morning to summarize the issues at stake
and discuss possible confidence building measures toward the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
A government source said that that among the measures being
considered is the further release of Palestinian prisoners held in
Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
The same source also said that the transfer of the three
villages including Abu Dis near Jerusalem to the Palestinians, is
no longer considered possible before the summit.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, outgoing Interior Minister Natan Sharansky will set
up a protest tent on Sunday outside the Prime Minister's Office.
</P>
<P>
Sharansky refused to support Barak's participation of the
summit, advocating the formation of a national unity government.

CANBERRA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Fiji coup leader George Speight
said Sunday he had reached a deal with the military for the
release of the 27 hostages, the Australian Broadcasting

</P>
<P>
George Speight said the hostages will be set free on Thursday

An agreement is expected to be signed by Speight and his
supporters and the military shortly to allow for the release of
the hostages.

Speight said he believed the country's hostage drama is almost
over.
</P>

"I'm putting the decision to them (the chiefs) on Thursday and
on the morning of that Thursday before the chiefs sit down all of
the hostages will be released. That is the plan," he said.

The ABC quoted rebel spokesman Jo Nata as saying that Speight
and his supporters have got what they want and are not interested
in democracy.

The town's police station is now controlled by a man giving the

<HEADLINE> No Civil Servants Become Redundant in HK: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 9 (Xinhua) -- None of the civil service reform
initiatives would result in forced redundancy of serving civil
servants or adversely affect their terms of appointment or
conditions of service, a Hong Kong government spokesman said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In response to media inquiries on a rally organized by a number
of civil service associations, the spokesman said the civil
service reform had been launched to enhance flexibility and
promote efficiency in the delivery of public service.
</P>
<P>
"The Basic Law allows for development of the civil service
management system and all civil service reform measures are
developed and implemented fully in line with its provisions," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that the government had taken into
account the views and concerns of the staff side and had followed
the principle of change amidst stability in formulating the civil
service reform proposals.
</P>
<P>
"It will continue to exercise care and sensitivity and fully
consult staff in introducing the approved reform measures and the
remaining initiatives," he said
</P>
<P>
Administrative Secretary Anson Chan said separately at a media
briefing that in an open and pluralistic society, civil servants,
like any other citizens, could choose their methods of expressing
their views, provided they complied with the law.
</P>
<P>
"We have many established channels to communicate with our
staff and these channels have been around for a long time and they
have proved on the whole very effective," she noted.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Interior Minister Resigns From Government EDS: Update With Details </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUASALEM, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Interior Minister Natan
Sharansky on Sunday submitted his resignation from the government,
which will take effect in 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
Explaining his resignation decision, Sharansky said Prime
Minister Ehud Barak is leaving for the United States with an
opening stand for
the negotiations which is unacceptable by most of the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Sharansky made the remarks after meeting with Barak. He said
Barak had attempted to dissuade him from resigning. They respect
each other and he tried to explain his stand, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sharansky thanked Barak for having let him run the Interior
Ministry and explained that his resignation was rooted in the
realization that his ability to influence the negotiations with the
Palestinians from within the coalition was virtually nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
"I have asked myself each day in the last months, whether
staying within a government headed on a dangerous path was wise",
Sharansky said. "The minute I made my decision it was like a rock
was lifted, and I will be working from outside the government for
the instatement of a national unity government", he added.
</P>
<P>
Sharansky, leader of Yisrael Ba'aliya which has four seats in
the 120-member Knesset (parliament), declared last Wednesday night
he would resign from the government at the next cabinet meeting (on
Sunday) after Barak said he would go to Washington to attend the
three-way Camp David summit even if he only had the support of
the "a quarter of the Knesset".
</P>
<P>
Sharansky has called for the forming of a national unity
government before going for the summit. He has also urged Barak to
reach a national consensus over the upcoming negotiations with the
Palestinians over remaining thorny issues including the state of
Jerusalem, border, water resources, the future of settlements and
the return of refugees.
</P>
<P>
The right-wing National Religious Party, which has six seats
in the Knesset, has also threatened to leave the coalition over
possible concessions to the Palestinians in the summit.
</P>
<P>
Barak has called on the parties to remain in the coalition,
whose resignation will leave him a minority coalition of 59 Knesset
members.

<HEADLINE> 1 Palestinian Woman Killed, 4 Wounded by Israeli Soldiers in Gaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian woman was shot dead and
four members of her family were wounded in the Gaza Strip on Sunday
by Israeli soldiers who opened fire on their car, Palestinian
security source said.
</P>
<P>
The tragedy occurred near the southern Gaza Strip's Kafre
Daroum Jewish settlement early Sunday morning when Itedal Maummar,
33, and her husband, 37, two children, six years and six months
respectively, were on their way home.
</P>
<P>
Maummar died on the spot with a shot in her head, and her
husband, two children as well as the driver were wounded, the
source said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side lodged a strongly-worded representation to
the "fresh crime" and urged the Israeli army to remove heavy arms
from the settlements.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army confirmed the incident, stressing that its
soldiers opened fire after they were attacked by a vehicle passing
on the same road.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that the Israeli army expressed regret
over the victims and the investigation was underway.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian Culture and Information Minister Yasser
Abed Rabbo said the tragedy was a fresh evidence that the Jewish
settlements posed a durable threat. He called upon the Israeli
government to dismantle and remove them as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place just two days before the start of the
controversial three-way summit in Camp David near Washington on
Tuesday between Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak together with host U.S President Bill Clinton.

JERUASALEM, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Interior Minister Natan
Sharansky is to tender his letter of resignation to Prime Minister
Ehud Barak on Sunday at the weekly cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
Sharansky, leader of Yisrael Ba'aliya which has four seats in

<HEADLINE> Barak's Words on Negotiation Stance Not Convinced: Shas Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Ehud Barak's words
on Israel's negotiation stance with the Palestinians are not
convinced, Shas leader Eli Yishai said here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after his meeting with Barak, who will
head the Israeli delegation to the Camp David three-way summit with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton,
Yishai said that he was not convinced by Barak's explanation about
the "red lines" that he will not cross over during the peace talks
with the Palestinians at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
Yishai refused to disclose the details about the "red lines,"
but said he has not yet decided whether or not to quit the
coalition.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Barak, Yishai went to consult with Shas
party spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef in order to further
formulating the party's position regarding the upcoming summit.
</P>
<P>
Yishai has been asking Barak for months to include him in
the peace process, while Barak turned a deaf ear. This time Yishai
refused to go to the summit with Barak and be a member of the
Israeli delegation, demending Barak to negotiate with Shas over
the "red lines" before leaving for Washington.
</P>
<P>
The support of Shas, which boasts 17 seats of the 120-member
Knesset (parliament), is vital for Barak to reach any peace
agreement with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In preparation of the summit, Barak is holding a meeting of
his security cabinet Sunday morning to summarize the issues at
stake and discuss possible confidence building measures toward the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
A government source said that among the measures being
considered is the further release of Palestinian prisoners held in
Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
The same source also said that the transfer of the three
villages including Abu Dis near Jerusalem to the Palestinians is
no longer considered possible before the summit.
</P>
<P>
Besides the security cabinet meeting, Barak will meet with
Foreign Minister David Levy to formulate Israel's positions for the
summit and decide whether Levy will be one of the 12 members of the
Israeli delegation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, outgoing Interior Minister Natan Sharansky will
set up a protest tent on Sunday outside the Prime Minister's
Office.
</P>
<P>
Sharansky refused to support Barak's participation of the
summit, advocating the formation of a national unity government.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Former Minister Charged With Sexual Harassment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli former Transport Minister
and Center Party Leader Yitzhak Mordechai was formally charged on
Sunday with committing an indecent act and sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
The indictment was served against Mordechai in Jerusalem
Magistrate's Court, where the trial is to be conducted.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset (parliament) House Committee removed on Wednesday
Mordechai's immunity so that he can stand trial on criminal
charges.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen members of the committee voted in favor of lifting
Mordechai's immunity while Roni Milo from Center Party abstained.
</P>
<P>
Before the committee's voting, Mordechai made a first public
comment in the Knesset on the Attorney General's decision to indict
him on sexual harassment charges.
</P>
<P>
"From the beginning of the affair, an unprecedented and
unbridled crusade of abuse and instigation was held against me," He
said.
</P>
<P>
"I was indicted, convicted and punished without a trial...all I
have to say in my defense, and I have a lot to say, I will say in
court, " He added.
</P>
<P>
"In the present circumstances I request my immunity to be
lifted, so that trial can be held, " Mordechai said.
</P>
<P>
The case against Mordechai came as a result of a complaint by a
Transport Ministry worker who complained in March that Mordechai
sexually harassed and assaulted her. Two other women also accused
Mordechai for sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai resigned from his posts of Transport Minister and in
the Center Party leadership in May following the announcement of
plans by Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein to indict him on
charges of sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
Rubinstein detailed on Wednesday to the committee the main
charges against Mordechai and asked the committee to lift
Mordechai's immunity, allowing him stand trial.
</P>
<P>
The trial may go on for many months, due to the fact that
Mordechai denies the accusations against him and because the
prosecution wants to bring 39 witnesses to the stand.
</P>
<P>
These witnesses include head of the police investigation
department and three women who made the complaints.

</P>
<P>
-- The Americans have formulated ideas to present at Tuesday's
Camp David summit, including the possible postponement of the
issues of Jerusalem and the return of refugees beyond a final-
status accord, a Palestinian source said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the source, the Palestinian leadership may soften
its opposition to such a postponement if the United States backs up
its plan either with other concessions from Israel or with a pledge
to provide assistance, such as U.S. troops to help police the
border between a Palestinian state and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- In preparation for the Camp David summit with the
Palestinians, expected to begin on Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak is holding a meeting of the Security Cabinet on Sunday

confidence building measures toward the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
A government source said that among the measures being
considered is the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli
prisons. The transfer of the villages outside Jerusalem will no
longer be considered possible. The villages will be kept as a
trading card for sensitive negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister and his staff are in the midst of a feverish
campaign to win over hearts and minds, both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- A Swiss Federal Court sentenced a Mossad agent to one year's
suspended sentence and expelled him from Switzerland on Friday on

MANILA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
earmarked some nine billion pesos (about 22.7 million U.S. dollars)
for road projects in Mindanao, in line with President Joseph
Estrada's efforts to develop the south.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Gregorio Vigilar of the Department of Public Works
and Highways said many of the projects will be funded by foreign
assistance, according to a local TV report Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The nine billion pesos will bankroll some 676 kilometers of
roads," Vigilar said, adding that at least two of the projects are
expected to be completed before Estrada's term ends in June 2004.
</P>
<P>
Among the projects is the Philippine-Japan Highway, which
covers Agusan, Davao, and Cotabato provinces. A second is the 300-
kilometer highway linking Zamboanga and Pagadian.
</P>
<P>
Vigilar said the projects have been planned for implementation
from 1999 to 2003.

<HEADLINE> Longer Power Cuts Expected in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Kenyans are expected to brace for
even more severe power rationing with more than 12 hours of power
cuts a day from this week, according to the energy sector.
</P>
<P>
A new supply schedule with extended rationing was already in
place, the major newspaper Sunday Standard reported.
</P>
<P>
The schedule is expected to last until alternative sources of
power are found and that could last up to two months.
</P>
<P>
The short-term hope for a relief to the rationing lies with the
 importation of more power from the neighboring country Uganda.
</P>
<P>
However, it is unlikely that Uganda will have much impact on
the supply situation considering that the import of power
sometimes is only 50 megawatts out of the anticipated 80
megawatts.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is in the process of negotiating for a supply of 80
megawatts from Kampala and the supply was expected to arrive in
mid-July, according to Kenya's Energy Minister Francis Lotodo.
</P>
<P>
Due to the prolonged drought in the east African country, power
 rationing which began last September has hampered the industry
sector and affected the lives of ordinary Kenyans.

<HEADLINE> Controversial New Zealand Soccer Figure to Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Controversial New Zealand soccer
administrator, Charlie Dempsey, said he will retire at the end of
September.
</P>
<P>
Dempsey created an international storm as Oceania's FIFA
representative when he abstained from a vote in Zurich that gave
the 2006 soccer World Cup to Germany.
</P>
<P>
Television NZ reported that Dempsey faced representatives of
the Oceania Football confederation Sunday in Auckland, the biggest
city of New Zealand, to explain why he failed to follow orders and
didn't vote for South Africa's World Cup bid.
</P>
<P>
Dempsey said he decided not to vote because he had been put
under"intolerable pressure" by supporters of the competing bids,
including attempts to bribe him.
</P>
<P>
He said that after some consideration, and media harassment, he
would retire in two months time, because he couldn't accept what
had taken place over the past three days.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, New Zealand Sport, Fitness and Leisure Minister
Trevor Mallard said in a government press release that the New
Zealand government is "extremely unhappy and disappointed with
Charlie Dempsey's role in the demise of South Africa's World Cup
Soccer bid."
</P>
<P>
"I'm shocked that one individual seems to have abused his
voting right by disregarding instructions on voting requirements,"
Minister Mallard said.
</P>
<P>
"Mr Dempsey has damaged the international reputation of the
entire country as well as the sport of soccer in New Zealand. His
actions could cast doubt on New Zealand's reliability on the
international stage," the minister said.

<P>
CAIRO, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading Egyptian newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Al Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said that the topics on
the agenda of the three-way summit to be held in Washington Tuesday
will prevail in the talks between President Hosni Mubarak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's meeting on Monday with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak will also figure high in the talks, Moussa said late
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa is to leave Cairo on
Monday for Lome on a three-day visit to Togo to lead his country's
delegation to the meeting of the 36th African summit, to begin
Monday.
</P>
<P>
On the sidelines of Lome summit to be held on July 10-12, Moussa
will hold meetings with a number of heads of states participating
in the summit and with a number of his African counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- The Palestinian Chief Delegate to the Arab League does not
believe that the Tuesday Palestinian-Israeli-U.S. summit at Camp
David will come up with big results.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Sobeih, in statements to Egypt's Middle East News

<HEADLINE> Iraq Slams U.N. Sanctions Committee for Shelving 1,989 Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 9 (Xinhua) -- A total of 1,989 contracts Iraq
signed with foreign countries have been put on hold by the U.N.
Sanctions Committee, because of obstacles placed by the U.S. and
British delegates at the committee.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the official Iraqi News Agency (INA)
on Sunday, Iraqi trade ministry said that during the past seven
phases of the U.N. oil-for-food program, the U.N. Sanctions
Committee shelved 1,989 contracts worth 3.1 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time for Iraq to summarize the total number of
contracts shelved by the U.N. Sanctions Committee.
</P>
<P>
The contracts, including 885 for the oil sector, 223 for health,
244 for electricity and 192 for the trade sector, were concluded
between Iraq and Arab, European and other countries.
</P>
<P>
The statement condemned the conduct of the U.S. and British
delegates who represent their governments' "hostile policy" towards
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. oil-for-food deal have failed to meet Iraq's needs, and
the total lifting of the U.N. sanctions is the only way to
alleviate sufferings of the Iraqi people, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has frequently accused the U.S. and British members at
the U.N. Sanctions Committee of blocking vital imports.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. statistics released in the last April, the U.
S. and Britain had blocked contracts worth over 1.6 billion dollars
for Iraq to buy daily necessities.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions ever since its August 1990
invasion of Kuwait, but the U.N. oil-for-food accord launched in
1996 allows Baghdad to export crude in return for U.N.-supervised
imports of food, medicine and humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
Iraq says the decade-old sanctions have claimed lives of over 1.
3 million people, causing a humanitarian crisis in the country.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand to Build New Safe Areas for Kiwi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government will
allocate an extra 10 million NZ dollars (about 5 million U.S.
dollars) to the kiwi recovery program of the Conservation
Department over the next five years, Television NZ reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Kiwi is a flightless bird which has been in New Zealand for 30
million years and is used as one of the more familiar symbols of
the country.
</P>
<P>
The increased budget allocation will result in the construction
of five new safe areas for kiwi.
</P>
<P>
The program's coordinator, Hugh Robertson, was quoted as saying
the money will fund five so-called mainland island areas where the
Conservation Department will intensively control pests such as
stoats and rats which kill the birds.
</P>
<P>
"The areas chosen will protect populations of the bird at
greatest risk of extinction," he said.
</P>
<P>
Two hundred years ago there were millions of kiwi living in New
Zealand. Today the total population is about 85,000 and numbers on
the mainland are declining by about 5.8 percent a year or halving
every decade.
</P>
<P>
"If this decline continues, then most of the kiwi populations
on the mainland face extinction within the next 75 years," an
official of the Conservation Department once told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The survival of kiwi is mainly threatened by land clearing and
predatory possums, stoats, rats, dogs and cats.

<HEADLINE> China Develops Key Techniques for Largest Radio Telescope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have made
breakthroughs in two key techniques applied to build the world's
largest radio telescope, according to the Beijing Astronomical
Observatory.
</P>
<P>
One of the techniques involves 2,000 pieces of metal to form
into a spherical surface for the radio telescope, with each piece
adjustable for keeping the direction and smoothness of the surface,
said Nan Rendong, chief scientist of the pre-research project.
</P>
<P>
The other key technique invented by Chinese scientists is
expected to reduce the weight of the platform of the telescope by
several hundred times.
</P>
<P>
The 500-m-diameter spherical radio telescope will be located in
the Karst Valley in southwest China's Guizhou Province. The
Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Ministry of Science and
Technology have devoted 10 million yuan to the pre-research
project.
</P>
<P>
The highly sensitive, high-resolution telescope will be
conducive to China's deep-space exploration projects, and will
fill the blank, in terms of longitude coverage, of the current
three deep-space exploration and sensing stations, which are
located in the US, Spain and Australia, respectively, thus
providing global, round-the-clock remote-control and
telecommunications services.
</P>
<P>
The project was the brain child of scientists from ten
countries, including Australia, Canada, China, the US and France,
who in 1993 suggested building a radio telescope with a receiving
area of one sq. km at a cost of one billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese scientists are striving to complete the first phase
of the telescope in one year.

<HEADLINE> China to Improve Meteorological Service for Western Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Meteorological services in west
China will be greatly improved to minimize losses caused by
natural disasters and to support overall development in the region,
promised the head of the China Meteorological Administration..
</P>
<P>
"Modern meteorological technologies and equipment will be
introduced to combat the frequent and long-plaguing natural
disasters in the western region," said Wen Kegang.
</P>
<P>
Satellite remote-sensing technology will play a more important
role in the weather forecasting in the vast, sparsely-populated
western region where terrain is rugged and communications nearly
non-existent, Wen noted.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China will set up more than 40 advanced Doppler
radar devices in the region in the coming five to ten years to
improve the accuracy of climatic disaster forecast.
</P>
<P>
China's western region, covering a total area of 5.4 million
square kilometers from cool temperate to semitropical zones, is
abundant in climatic resources such as solar, wind and geothermal
energies. Modern meteorological technologies will also help tap
the potential energies, Wen stated.
</P>
<P>
So far, a network of 1,017 meteorological observation stations
has been formed in the western region to monitor the ecological
environment round-the-clock.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the China Meteorological Administration will build
more artificial rainfall centers in the western region to relieve
water shortages, Wen added.

<HEADLINE> NGOs Involvement Worries Bangladeshi Private Entrepreneurs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's private sector is faced
with an uneven competition as the non-governmental organizations
NGOs), backed by soft loans and grants, are making business
ventures in a bigger way, a Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry
(DCCI) official was quoted by The Daily Star as saying Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We are noticing with concern that the private sector is facing
an uneven competition from the NGO-run businesses which get tax
exemptions and capital at nominal rates," said Aftab ul Islam,
President of the DCCI, while addressing a seminar "Recent Trend of
The Country's Economy and WTO" Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Investments by the NGOs have increased significantly over the
years and have become a major player in business, he noted, adding
that the NGOs are now dominating many sectors, including the
telecommunications and printing.
</P>
<P>
He also apprehended that the NGOs might become a major player
in the gas and mineral resources sectors in future.
</P>
<P>
In this context, Islam demanded a clear policy for NGOs to
ensure transparency and accountability in their financial
activities so that the private sector and the NGOs are placed on a
level playing field.
</P>
<P>
The DCCI chief also said the worsening law and order situation
in the country compounded by confrontational politics is taking a
heavy toll on business activities.
</P>
<P>
Mentioning that a total of 286 days have been wasted during the
last 10 years due to hartals (destructive strikes), Islam urged
the political parties to avoid politics of confrontation and help
prepare the country to face the challenges.

<HEADLINE> Day Elected Head of Canada's Biggest Opposition Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Stockwell Day won the leadership of
Canada's biggest opposition party, the Canadian Alliance, in the
second round of the party's election which concluded in Toronto
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Day led with 58,086 votes, about 63 percent of the total 91,560
votes counted. The other 33,474 votes went to his rival Preston
Manning, who is both the new Canadian Alliance party's founder and
leader of the former official opposition Reform Party in
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Conceding in defeat, Manning said, "I accept the judgment of
the members of the Canadian Alliance. And I congratulate our new
leader Stockwell Day."
</P>
<P>
Manning succeeded in persuading his Reform Party, which enjoyed
60 seats in the House of Commons, to form a right alliance with
some provincial conservatives three months ago. He urged the
party members to "think big" in forming the alliance to unseat the
ruling Liberal Party in the next election expected in the spring
of 2001.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian Alliance has proven a success in expansion with
its membership rising to more than 200,000 in the past three
months. This nearly triples the former Reform Party's membership
of about 75,000.
</P>
<P>
Day, 49, formerly served as the provincial treasurer in Alberta.
His vigor, freshness and record in cutting down taxes and debts in
Alberta are impressive to many of the Canadian Alliance members.

<HEADLINE> Strong Quake Hits Japan's Kozushima, Niijima Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 9 (Xinhua) -- A strong earthquake measuring 6 on
the Richter scale jolted the islands of Kozushima and Niijima in
the Izu Islands chain early Sunday morning, the Meteorological
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The tremor struck the two islands, which are about 170
kilometers south of Tokyo, at 3:57 a.m. (local time).
</P>
<P>
The epicenter of the quake was estimated to be 10 kilometers
under the seabed in waters near the islands, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake triggered at least six landslides on the 19-
square-kilometer Kozushima, which has about 2,300 inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
It also caused a water pipe to burst on Kozushima. Three
concrete walls collapsed and earth caved in at two locations.
However, no casualties were reported so far.
</P>
<P>
On July 1, a powerful quake measuring 6.4 on the Richter scale
rocked the Kozushima island. One of the landslides caused by the
quake killed a man.
</P>
<P>
The island has since been rocked by numerous quakes.

<P>
HELSINKI, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Natalia Baranovskaya won the women
's 200 meters freestyle gold for Belarus at the European swimming
championships on Saturday but needed to swim the race twice to do
it because of a technical hitch the first time.
</P>
<P>
Because the amplifying system had not worked properly, the
organisers decided to reswim the women's 200 freestyle after
Slovakia's Martina Moravcova was left standing on the blocks,
unable to hear the start properly, before giving chase.
</P>
<P>
Moravcova and her coach complained to the referee afterwards
and the Belgian federation also put in a written protest after
their swimmer Nina Van Koeckhoven said she could not hear the
starting procedure either.
</P>
<P>
The rematch started one and a half hours later after the first
attempt and Baranovskaya once again won the race in one minute 59.
51 seconds, beating defending champion Camelia Potec on the last
length.
</P>
<P>
Moravcova, who had trailed in the sixth the first time, took
the silver in 2:00.08 and 18-year-old Romanian Potec the bronze in
2:00.32.
</P>
<P>
Lars Frolander of Sweden claimed the men's 100 meters
butterfly European record in 52.23 as he won the event for the
third time in succession. The previous mark 52.27 was set by Denis
Pankratov in July 1996 at the Atlanta Olympics where the Russian
won both 100 and 200 butterfly.
</P>

Germany's Thomas Rupprath came to second in 53.38 and Britain'

</P>
<P>
Hungary's Agnes Kovacs's dream of repeating the feat of a
treble golds in the breaststroke at last year's championships was
ruined by Romanian Beatrice Caslaru.
</P>
<P>
Caslaru, who shared gold with Ukraine's Yana Klochkova in
Thursday's 200 individual medley, beat the Hungarian world
champion on the last length to snatch the gold by a mere 0.09
seconds in 2:26.76. Kovacs had earlier retained her 50 and 100

<HEADLINE> Status of Restricted Isolation Issued in Maluku, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- A status of restricted isolation
was issued in Maluku, Indonesia, on Saturday to anticipate further
intrusion of provocateurs and smuggling of weapons to the province,
according to the Antara News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Maluku Governor Saleh Latuconsina, who is also civil emergency
chief executive in his province, took the decision after a weekly
meeting to evaluate the progress of civil emergency.
</P>
<P>
The governor has to isolate his province with an aim to prevent
further economic suffering that has long threatened the life of
people in Maluku.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the possibility of an increase in violence, he
stressed it will all depend on the awareness of the people on the
importance of restraining their emotion and avoiding taking law
into their own hands,
</P>
<P>
As the administrator of civil emergency, the governor said he
will have to build a closer coordination with Pattimura regional
military commander and Maluku police chief.
</P>
<P>
The authority over the state of civil emergency in the strife-
torn provinces of Maluku and North Maluku is delegated to the
governors, assisted by Pattimura regional military commander,
Maluku police chief and the Maluku High Prosecution Office.
</P>
<P>
Under a state of civil emergency, the relevant authorities may
issue stringent regulations, ask information from civil servants,
impose any rules on restriction in printing, publication and give
notifications.
</P>
<P>
Authorities also have the right to search any places, check and
confiscate anything allegedly used for peace disturbance.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the top administrators are authorized to check
conversations through the radio, restrict the use of codes,
curtail public meetings, restrict entry into Maluku and North
Maluku, ban people from leaving their homes, do body searching,
control police agencies and fire fighting squads.
</P>
<P>
Since the declaration of civil emergency on June 26, violence
in Maluku has reportedly declined. The latest unrest broke out
early on Thursday, killing at least 22 people and injuring 57
others.
</P>
<P>
The spice islands of Maluku have been wrecked by communal
clashes since early 1999. Thousands of people were either killed
or wounded and hundreds of public buildings destroyed.

<HEADLINE> Health Condition of Slovak President Improving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The health condition of Slovak
President Rudolf Schuster, who is receiving medical treatment at
an Austrian hospital, has improved, according to reports reaching
here from Vienna.
</P>
<P>
Reports quoted an Austrian doctor in charge of treating
Schuster as saying that the president was disconnected from
respirator on Saturday or July 7.
</P>
<P>
The doctor said that Schuster is now able to sit in a specially-
designed chair and listen to people asking questions in Slovak or
German. However, he said Schuster is not expected to talk in two
or three days.
</P>
<P>
Schuster will continue to stay in the hospital in Innsbruck, a
quiet town in Austria. But he needs further improvement before the
date of his returning home can be decided, the doctor said.
</P>
<P>
Schuster was hospitalized on June 14 with a high fever. Doctors
found a puncture in his colon. Schuster then underwent two
emergency operations, which were followed by massive abdominal
infection, pneumonia and problems with blood coagulability.
</P>
<P>
Slovak Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda and the parliament
speaker, Jozef Migas, have assumed the power of the president
after a joint decision made by the Slovak government and
parliament.

<HEADLINE> Germany Ensures More Jobs for Seriously Disabled People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Assembly of Germany
passed a resolution Friday to offer more jobs to seriously
disabled people.
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, a total of 50,000 additional jobs will be
created exclusively for the seriously disabled people by the end
of 2002, thus cutting down the number of the unemployed seriously
disabled people from 182,000 at present to 132,000.
</P>
<P>
This resolution, submitted by Labor Minister Walter Riester,
aims at readjusting the "balanced tax" and the employment rate of
seriously disabled people.
</P>
<P>
From now on, all enterprises in Germany have to employ
seriously disabled people that account for 5 percent of the total
employees. If they fail to do so, they will be fined 500 German
marks as balance tax for each job post instead of the 200 German
marks as done in the past.
</P>
<P>
To relieve the burden on the enterprises, the bill also cuts
down the percentage of employment rate of seriously disabled
people from 6 percent in the past to 5 percent at present.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Germany's balance tax can help the
government increase annual revenue of one billion German marks.

BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- China's industrial enterprises are
expected to achieve a net profit of 300 billion yuan (36.1 billion
U.S. dollars) in 2000, said Xu Jianyi with of the National Bureau
of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned and state-controlled companies are expected to
generate 130 billion yuan (15.7 billion U.S. dollars) in profits,
said Xu, director of the bureau's industrial and transportation
statistics department.
</P>
<P>
In January-May period, the average daily cargo transport by
trains was 80,000 cars, an increase of 4.2 percent from last year;
The total electric output generated by power plants increased by 9.
5 percent, and industrial use of electricity rose 10.3 percent,
China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
"All the major indicators suggest that the quality of China's
industrial enterprises continued to improve during the first five
months of this year," Xu said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that during the five-month period, the net
profit achieved by industrial enterprises amounted to 125.4
billion yuan (15.1 billion U.S. dollars), up 130 percent. The net
profit by state-owned and state-controlled industrial companies
was 69.2 billion yuan (8.3 billion U.S. dollars), up 310 percent.
</P>
<P>
The accelerated pace of industrial production and sales, the
expanded export stemming from the recovery of world economy and
the supporting measures taken by the Chinese Government to
encourage export all contributed to the profit increase, Xu noted.
</P>
<P>
The export value by Chinese industrial companies reached 504.3
billion yuan (60.8 billion U.S. dollars) in the five months, up 26.
9 percent.

<HEADLINE> China to Increase Coal Exports This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- China has planned to increase its
coal exports to help relax uphill oversupply in the domestic
market and rescue debt-ridden coal mines.
</P>
<P>
The central government administrators said they hope the
industry will sell about 50 million tons of coal in foreign
markets this year, compared with 39 million tons in 1999,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The China National Coal Import and Export (Group) Corp. (CNCIEC)
, which now has a majority share in the nation's total coal
exports, is being urged to sell 35 million tons of the products
abroad in 2000, said a CNCIEC official.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government has so far approved four Chinese
companies to handle coal exports. Besides CNCIEC, the other three
are the China National Minerals and Metals Import and Export (
Group) Corp. the Shanxi Provincial Coal Import and Export Co, and
the Shenhua Group, a giant conglomerate based on the Shenfu-
Dongsheng Coal Mine, located in the north of Shanxi Province and
part of Inner Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
The three firms are expected to export a total of 15 million
tons of coal this year, official sources indicated.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months this year, China exported a total of
20.94 million tons of coal, or 42 percent of its planned 2000
target.
</P>
<P>
As the world's largest coal producer, China currently produces
around 1 billion tons of coal annually, almost one-third of the
world's total. However, China's exports only make up approximately
8 percent of the world's total trade volume.
</P>
<P>
An official from the State Coal Industry Administration, who
asked not to be named, said that the Chinese industries should
raise the quality of coal exports in order to better cater to
overseas customers' requirements.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, July 8 (Xinhua) -- A multinational peacekeeping exercise
"Peace Shield- 2000" began its preparatory stage Saturday at
Ukraine's Yavoriv training range, said the Ukrainian Defense
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
During the preparatory stage, lasting until July 13, about 1,
300 servicemen from 21 countries worldwide are due to arrive in
Ukraine. The official stage of the exercise begins from July 14 to
22.
</P>
<P>
The war game is to train commanders' decision-making ability
and to test their actions on controlling over multinational troops
in order to organize and perform U.N.-authorized peacekeeping
operations in conflict zones.
</P>
<P>
Last year's "Peace Shield" exercise was also held in Ukraine,
as more than 12,000 servicemen from 15 countries took part in it.
</P>
<P>
The Yavoriv military base, locating at Ukraine's western
region of Lviv, was selected last year as a NATO educational
training range for international peacekeeping forces.

<HEADLINE> Perec Qualifies for Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Triple Olympic champion Marie-Jose
Perec of France clinched a berth for the Sydney Olympics at the
IAAF Nice Grand Prix meet on Saturday after coming home third in
her first 400 meters in four years.
</P>
<P>
The two-time 400 meter titlist at the 1992 and 1996 Olympics
clocked in 50.32 seconds, a well-beaten third behind the winner
Katharine Merry of Britain in 50.05 but comfortably under the
Olympic qualifying standard of 50.50.
</P>
<P>
Perec was plagued by Epstein-Barr disease and chronic fatigue
syndrome after the Atlanta Olympic Games where she completed a
gold-double over 200 and 400 meters.
</P>
<P>
The Frenchwoman did not race at all in 1998 while her comeback
bid last season never really took off, ending after just five
races, all over the 200 meters and without a win.
</P>
<P>
Perec led the field out onto the track and looked comfortable
through first 200 meters, but over the final 100 meters the 32-
year-old veteran was unable to compete Merry and Jamaica's
Lorraine Graham.

China to Revise Fisheries Law for Better Protection
</P>
<P>
The National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee is
considering revising the existing fisheries law by introducing
fishing licenses and production ceilings into the fish stocks
protection mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Agriculture Chen Yaobang, elaborated on the draft
revisions to the fisheries law to the Ninth NPC Standing Committee
at its 16th meeting, which opened on July 3.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, many problems have sprung up in the fishing
industry, lots of aquatic farms have been encroached upon and
excessive fishing has endangered fish resources while some
offenders might have escaped punishment.

Rain Eases North China Droughts
</P>
<P>
Strong precipitation over the past few days has alleviated the
drought in north China, but the region is still short of water,
the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters said in
Beijing on July 6.
</P>
<P>
From July 3 to 6, much of the region received 25 to 50 mm of
rain. Parts of Beijing and Hebei got as much as 200 mm of rain.
</P>
<P>
The rain has greatly improved the soil moisture content, and
will benefit the growth of autumn crops, said officials at the
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
As the precipitation has been short and the drought severe,
some parts of the region are still facing shortages of drinking
water.

Weeds Rampant in Taihu Lake

<P>
Blue algas is spreading rampantly in Taihu Lake in east China's

black belt of the weed in the Lake is 50 meters wide and dozens of
kilometers long, giving a repugent smell.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the rampant growth of blue algas is directly due
to the supernutrition of water caused by excessive discharge of
nitrogen, phosphor and others into the lake. Water quality in the
lake has notably worsened over the past year.

<P>
Mass Media Urged to Devote More to Reporting Environment
</P>
<P>
An environment reporting project was launched in Hong Kong on
July 5 to encourage the local mass media to devote more efforts to
reporting environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
"It is with a sense of urgency that we are launching what we
believe is Asia's first university-based program for training
professional and student reporters in environmental journalism,"
Lily Yam, secretary for the environment and food, said when
announcing the project at a conference on environmental journalism
at the University of Hong Kong.

Ningxia Bans Picking Sand-Fixing Wild Plants
</P>
<P>
The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, in northwest China, has
banned the picking and sale of sand-fixing wild plants, such as
wild algae and licorice root.
</P>
<P>
At a live television conference on July 3, the provincial
government announced a series of measures to check such activities,
which have posed a serious threat to the fragile ecological
environment.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in recent years, about 160,000 farmers in

Wild Giant Panda Population Growing: Survey
</P>
<P>
The third nationwide survey of the giant panda population has
shown that the number of giant pandas living in the Wolong Nature
Reserve in southwest China's Sichuan Province is increasing, and
their habitat is expanding.
</P>
<P>
The results indicate that measures aimed at improving the
ecological environment of the reserve have taken effect. Since
1963, when the reserve was established, the coverage of forests
has been expanding from 53 percent to 70.6 percent. This was
achieved by turning farmland into forested land and greening
mountains, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the air and water quality in the region has reached
the State's top standard, with local residents moved out and
electricity-generated power introduced, Zhang added.

<HEADLINE> Cardiff May Host English FA Cup Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The Millennium Stadium in Cardiff
has emerged as the overwhelming favorite to host the FA Cup final
from 2001-3 while Wembley is redeveloped.
</P>
<P>
The FA's executive director David Davies said: "It is our
preferred option. We will only consider other places if needs be."
</P>
<P>
Certain issues remain to be resolved between the WRU, owners of
the Millennium Stadium, and the FA, but Davies is confident of
reaching an agreement.
</P>
<P>
"We're confident there will be a settlement and solution with
our friends in Wales," he said.
</P>
<P>
The deal will initially be for one year, but if successful it
is likely to continue until 2003.
</P>
<P>
The stadium has fought off competition from the likes of Old
Trafford, Anfield and Twickenham.
</P>
<P>
The deal will help stadium bosses to pay mounting debts from
its construction - there has been recent criticism that not enough
use has been made of the impressive facilities.
</P>
<P>
It means the cup returning to Wales for the first time since it
was won by Cardiff City in 1927 and it will be the first final
held away from Wembley since 1923.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United manager Alex
Ferguson confirmed Saturday that he would be interested to by
Everton's Nick Barmby.
</P>
<P>
The midfielder made his international comeback in time for Euro
2000 but on his return revealed he wanted to quit Everton and join
arch rivals Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
Liverpool manager Gerard Houllier is believed to have offered 5.
3 million pounds for the former Tottenham and Middlesbrough man
whose contract runs out next summer.
</P>
<P>
But now Ferguson has joined the race after hearing Barmby was
available on a cut-price deal.
</P>
<P>
He explained: "We are going to lose Quinton Fortune to South
Africa for three months at the start of the season. He's got the
Olympic Games and World Cup qualifiers so he won't be around for
pre-season and for a while.
</P>
<P>
"Jordi Cruyff has left the club and Jesper Blomqvist may not be
back straight away after his knee injury all last term."
</P>
<P>
Ferguson is good friends with Everton manager Walter Smith but
will not agree to a deal that would see England midfielder Nicky
Butt travel in the other direction.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Nicky Butt is perfectly happy here. He doesn't always
play but who does always play here at United?"

<HEADLINE> Venus Williams Wins Wimbledon Women's Singles Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Venus Williams of the Untied States
won the battle of the giants to claim the women's singles crown at
Wimbledon on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It was the 20-year-old American's first Grand Slam title when
she defeated defending champion fellow American Lindsay Davenport
6-3,7-6 (7-3).
</P>
<P>
It was not a classic final by any means but Williams always
looked to have the edge against Davenport.
</P>
<P>
And the victory clearly meant a lot to the fifth seed, who
bounced around the center court in celebration as her achievement
quickly sunk in.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after her win, Williams, who pockets 430,000 pounds,
admitted she had been dreaming of success at the All England Club
for a long time.
</P>
<P>
"It's really great because I've been working hard all my life
to be here," she said.
</P>
<P>
"I used to go to bed and dream that I'd won a Grand Slam, but
when I woke up it was a nightmare," she added.
</P>
<P>
Both players looked nervous early on once the match started 30
minutes later than planned because of rain.
</P>
<P>
No sooner had Davenport, with strapping at the top of her left
leg, broken in the opening game than Williams hit right back to
square things up.
</P>
<P>
It was Williams who settled quickest.
</P>
<P>
She raced into a 4-1 lead as her powerful serves and returns
left Davenport's normally reliable defence in tatters.
</P>
<P>
Not the most agile of movers around the court, the reigning
champion scurried in vain as she tried to get a racquet on the
ball.
</P>
<P>
The points she did win on the Williams serve often came
courtesy of some unforced errors by her over-eager opponent.

<HEADLINE> China Wins All But One in U.S. Open/ITTF Pro Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FT. LAUDERDALE, Florida, July 8 (Xinhua) -- Wang Liqin staged a
strong rally from two sets down to take the men's singles title,
enabling China to win three out of four gold medals at the U.S.
Open/ITTF Pro Tour here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The second-ranked Chinese defeated Chiang Peng-Lung of Chinese
Taipei 16-21, 15-21, 21-18, 22-20 and 21-11 in 75 minutes at the
Howard County Conventional Center.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Wang Nan outpowered her Chinese compatriot Sun Jin 21-
11, 21-17 and 23-21 for the women's title and Kong Linghui paired
with Liu Guoliang won the men's doubles by beating another Chinese
due of Wang Liqin and Yan Sen 21-14, 20-22 and 21-16.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Taipei won the women's doubles through Chen Jing and Xu
Jing who defeated Yang Ying and Sun Jin 21-18 and 21-15.
</P>
<P>
"It's a great performance for Wang Liqin as he rallied back
from two sets down and two break points in the fourth set," said
Cai Zhenhua, head coach of the Chinese table tennis team.
</P>
<P>
"Wang should play better in the first two sets but he failed to
carry on his tactics forcefully in the later stages," Cai said, "
however, Chiang also had a great performance and we will devote
more efforts to prepare for the coming Olympic Games."
</P>
<P>
Wang was out of the rhythm in the first two sets wherein he
squandered his slim lead once the scoreboard number 10 above for
either side.
</P>
<P>
Starting from the third set, Wang once led 17-13 but lost four
points in his serves before hitting a string of smashes for the
beginning of the strong rally.
</P>
<P>
The fourth set was deadlocked 10-all and 15-all before Wang
faced two championships points when he lagged behind 18-20,
however he spared no efforts to choke the last four points in a
row for an exciting ending, a surprise to most of the American
audience.
</P>
<P>
In the decider, Wang rushed ahead 8-3 before a time-out from
Chinese Taipei, exchanged the court leading 10-4, and enlarged the
margin to 19-11 before serving out the marathon match for a prize
money of 13,000 US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Open/ITTF Pro Tour attracted 77 top players from the
world as it served as the penultimate leg prior to the Olympic
Games.
</P>
<P>
All the players will fly to Brazil days later for the last stop
of the Tour.

year, according to the Ministry of Education.
</P>
<P>
The exams will be held, as they are every year, on July 7-9.
</P>
<P>
Chinese universities will enroll 2.04 million students this
year, which means about 52.5 percent of the exam participants will
have the chance to continue their college study.

The general offices of the Communist Party of China Central
Committee and the State Council has issued a circular on
strengthening the building and management of facilities for
schoolchildren to pass their spare time outside school hours.
</P>
<P>
China has 240 million schoolchildren, but the existing spare-
time facilities are far short of meeting their needs in terms of
quantity, layout and scale, according to the circular.
</P>
<P>
It urges relevant government departments at all levels to
conduct an overall examination of the existing sites to find any
problems and deal with them in time. Financial departments at all
levels should provide necessary assistance for the purpose, it
adds.
</P>
<P>
 One Million Students Bound for Rural Areas
</P>
<P>
Starting from July 3, over one million students will go to
rural areas for social practice work this summer, according to the
Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China.
</P>
<P>
More college students and professional school students have
participated in these activities this year than last year. In east
China's Jiangsu province alone, more than 300,000 students have
volunteered.
</P>
<P>
In addition, about 1,800 doctorate students will join the
activity, 60 percent of whom will go to the western regions of the
country to help improve the levels of science, culture and health
there.
</P>
<P>
 New Institute to Train More Teachers for Deaf Children
</P>
<P>
An institute was set up on July 5 in Beijing to train
professional teachers to help deaf children retrieve their hearing.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Hearing and Language Recuperation Technologies
Institute was founded by the China Disabled Persons' Federation
and Beijing Union University. It will train teachers to help deaf
children improve their hearing and speaking abilities through a
series of scientific programs.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China now has 800,000 deaf children under
seven years old, most of whom still have some hearing ability and
could recover with the help of effective training.

Industry Development Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the university will provide digital video
technology to the new company, while the two companies will be

</P>
<P>
 Campus Ideological, Ethical Education Emphasized
</P>
<P>
China's educational authorities urged schools nationwide to
enhance ideological and ethical education among both students and
teachers.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Education Chen Zhili said on July 5 that greater
importance should be attached to ideological and political work,
as well as the work of building the Chinese Communist Party on
campuses in the new circumstances.
</P>
<P>
More young and highly-qualified intellectuals in colleges and
universities will be encouraged to join the Party. Courses to
introduce Marxism and Deng Xiaoping theory and to enhance students
' ethical awareness should be available at more colleges, Chen
said at a national meeting on Party building in colleges.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Meretz Willing to Return to Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 9 (XInhua) -- Israel's left-wing Meretz party,
upon learning of the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party's resignation from
the government, announced on Sunday it is willing to return to the
coalition immediately.
</P>
<P>
A meeting is scheduled for Sunday night between Prime Minister
Ehud Barak and representatives of Meretz to discuss a "safety net"
for the government.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time that politicians have put their personal
interests over national interests," said Barak on Sunday, referring
to Shas's resignation from the government.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time that the elected representatives of the
people will allow the prime minister to leave for an important
negotiation without backing," he added.
</P>
<P>
Barak sent his confidant, Minister of Communication Binyamin Ben
Eliezer, earlier in the morning to the Jerusalem home of Shas's
spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, to try and dissuade Shas from
resigning from the government. He also asked Eliezer to try to
arrange a meeting for him with the rabbi.
</P>
<P>
Eliezer met neither of these two demands. He reportedly
explained to Rabbi Ovadia Yosef that Barak's red lines were clearly
defined and not negotiable.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after Eliezer left the rabbi's house, Jerusalem
Mayor Ehud Olmert arrived there. Olmert told the rabbi that the
resignation of Shas from the government could aid in preventing
Barak from signing an agreement that would compromise the security
of the settlers and endanger the status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Shas, the largest ruling partner in Barak's coalition, decided
on Sunday to bolt the coalition, citing Barak's failure to specify
in detail what his "red lines" are in the negotiations for the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The defection by the 17-seat Shas, which Barak had tried by all
might to keep in the coalition even at the expense of the staunch
supporter of the peace process - the Meretz, has dealt a heavy blow
to the prime minister on the eve of his departure for the Camp
David summit slated for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, when Shas brought the coalition to the verge of
collapse over funding for the deficit-ridden school network, the
three ministers of the six-seat Meretz party offered to quit the
government to pave the way for Shas's continued stay in the
coalition.
</P>
<P>
The resignation of Shas, together with the four-seat Yisrael
Ba'aliya led by Interior Minister Natan Sharansky earlier on Sunday
and the expected withdrawal by the five-seat NRP, will leave Barak
with a crippling 42-78 minority in the 120-member parliament.
</P>
<P>
Even with the joining of some left-leaning parties, such as the
Meretz Party and the secular Shinui Party which has six seats in
the parliament and said it would join the coalition once Shas is
out, it is still difficult for Barak to secure a majority
coalition.
</P>
<P>
Under this circumstance, Barak may put a peace deal to a public
referendum or call an early election when he brings a peace deal
back from the Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
Monday morning, Barak will head for Egypt to consult with the
country's leaders on the three-way summit and then return home in
the afternoon to attend the a debate on a motion of non-confidence
against the government put forward by the Likud bloc on July 5.
After the debate, he will be flown to the U.S. to attend the
summit.

<HEADLINE> Sampras Sets Record at Wimbledon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Top seed and defending champion Pete
Sampras of the United States defeated 12th seed Pat Rafter of
Australia 6-7 (10-12), 7-6 (7-5), 6-4, 6-2 to win the men's
singles final at the Wimbledon tennis championships here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It is the seventh Wimbledon singles title in eight years for
Sampras, and also the 13th for the American in the four Grand Slam
tournaments, beating the record set by Australian Roy Emerson. He
also equaled the record of Britain's William Renshaw who won seven
men's titles here in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, who has never lost a final or a five-set match at
Wimbledon, won 477,500 pounds (725,000 U.S. dollars) in prize
money.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, watched for the first time by his parents in a Grand
Slam final, wiped tears from his eyes after Rafter failed to
return yet another big serve on matchpoint.
</P>
<P>
He then ran up to the stands to embrace with his parents.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Warns of Violence If Summit Fails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton has
warned that the Middle East will face more hostility or even
violence if the upcoming three-way summit at Camp David, Maryland,
ends as a complete failure.
</P>
<P>
"If the parties do not seize this moment to make more progress,
there will be more hostility and more bitterness -- perhaps even
more violence," Clinton wrote in a column to be published by
Newsweek magazine Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Delay is no longer an option: the parties themselves have set
a September deadline for resolving the final issues dividing them.
Moreover, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict knows no status quo. It
can move forward toward peace, or can slide back into turmoil. It
will not stand still," the president wrote.
</P>
<P>
He urged Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat to seize the chance to resolve the most
complex and sensitive issues for a final peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
Clinton wrote the column on the even of the upcoming Camp David
summit with Barak and Arafat, which is aimed at breaking the
deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian final status talks.

<P>
"I think the president will be making his decision later this
Summer," Albright said, based on recommendations from her, Defense
Secretary William Cohen and Sandy Berger, the national security
adviser.
</P>
<P>
It would be "irresponsible" for the administration to put off
the decision, Albright said on the ABC program "This Week."
</P>
<P>
"There are four criteria that the president is going to be
looking at: the threat, the technology, the cost and what it does
to overall American security," Albright said.

Early Saturday, a U.S. interceptor missile failed to hit a
speeding target warhead in space in a 100-million-U.S.-dollar test
of the system. The warhead-busting "kill vehicle" failed to
separate from its booster rocket and passed harmlessly by the
target missile.
</P>
<P>
The missile could weigh heavily in a decision that President
Clinton will make on whether to begin building a new radar in
Alaska for the NMD.
</P>
<P>
Berger said Saturday's failure does not necessarily mean the
president will scrap the plan.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, this does go to the question of technical
feasibility or how far along the system is, but we need an
assessment," he said on the CBS "Face The Nation" program Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The anti-missile system is designed to provide protection for
all 50 U.S.states against ballistic missile attacks from other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Arms control experts said the U.S. NMD, opposed by the
international community, will not only spark a new arms race, but
also threaten security and stimulate nuclear proliferation,
instead of promoting security and stemming the spread of nuclear
weapons.

<HEADLINE> N.Ireland's Drumcree March Ends Peacefully </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Orange Order's Drumcree parade
passed off in Northern Ireland on Sunday, but hundreds of
protesters remained close to the massive barricade erected by the
security forces to stop the march.
</P>
<P>
Backed by thousands of supporters, the Portadown district lodge
said that it would not be going home after failing to hand in a
letter of protest to security forces preventing them from entering
the nationalist Garvaghy Road area of the town, the BBC reported.
</P>
<P>
Church of Ireland Primate Archbishop Robin Eames has called for
the Orangemen to leave Drumcree Hill and go home amid fears that
Northern Ireland could witness a seventh night of violent protests.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 100 number of Orangemen staged a protest at
Hillsborough Castle, the official home of Northern Ireland
Secretary Peter Mandelson.
</P>
<P>
At the end of their annual service at Drumcree church, the
lodge's district master Harold Gracey, officers and members
paraded to the huge barrier at the bottom of Drumcree Hill to hand
in a letter of protest.
</P>
<P>
On reaching the barrier, officers declared that they had been
denied the opportunity for the first time in 104 Sundays to
formally protest to the police.
</P>
<P>
Troops and police staged a huge show of force to stop hundreds
of Protestant Orange Order supporters in the hamlet of Drumcree
and enforce a ban on them marching through a Roman Catholic
enclave in the nearby town of Portadown.
</P>
<P>
The Drumcree parade has long been a sectarian flashpoint in the
British province but a week of nightly violence by Protestant
hardliners against the ban had stoked tensions even higher than
usual this year.
</P>
<P>
Police said there had been 201 attacks on security forces since
July 1, including 12 shooting incidents.
</P>
<P>
No one has yet claimed responsibility for bombing a police
station overnight in the Stewartstown area, about 25 kilometers
from Drumcree, but police said an Irish Republican Army spinter
group, the Real IRA, was probably behind it.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson joined
senior Protestant and Catholic politicians in condemning the
bombing as an attempt to inflame tensions.
</P>
<P>
The Orange Order stages its annual marches to celebrate
centuries-old Protestant battlefield victories but they anger
Catholics who brand them as triumphalist.
