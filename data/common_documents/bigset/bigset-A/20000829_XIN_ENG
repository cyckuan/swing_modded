<HEADLINE> Pakistan Condemns Indian Firing Across LoC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan on Monday condemned
the "continued targeting of the civilian population by Indian
forces across the Line of Control (LoC)."
</P>
<P>
"The government of Pakistan once again calls upon India to
respect the Line of Control and refrain from acts aimed at
terrorizing the civilian population living near it," said a
Foreign Office statement issued here.
</P>
<P>
It said an "unprovoked and indiscriminate shelling" by the
Indian artillery and mortars resulted in the killing of three
women, a boy and a girl in the Kel sector on Saturday and another
woman in the Khuiratta sector on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It also caused substantial losses to houses and property in
villages in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, it added.
</P>
<P>
The LoC divides the disputed area of Kashmir and Indian and
Pakistani troops regularly exchange fire across it.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Restore Private Sector as Economy Recovers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 28 (Xinhua) -- As the economy continues to
recover, Malaysia will revert its fiscal stance and once again
restore the private sector as the engine of growth, Finance
Minister Daim Zainuddin said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Concerted efforts by the government to accelerate the economic
recovery and to strengthen and deepen the financial and capital
markets have helped the private sector weather the economic
downturn, he said at a dinner during the conference on "Central
Banking, Globalization and Sustainable Development in the 21st
Century" held here.
</P>
<P>
The private sector recovered in 1999 to account for 74 percent
of the total financing, he said, adding net funds raised by the
private sector in the capital market were 8.5 billion ringgit(2.23
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The minister pointed out that in moving ahead, the Malaysian
economy will be facing a rapidly changing global economic and
financial landscape.
</P>
<P>
He spelt out three fundamental forces of change driving the
move to the new global economy -- rapid advances in technology,
liberalization of trade and financial markets, and greater
reliance on knowledge for value creation.
</P>
<P>
He said as these three forces will raise the technology and
knowledge content of products and services, the competitive
advantage of the future will be based on intellectual capital and
exploitation of knowledge.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia needs to take advantage of the opportunities of the
new global environment by acquiring, adapting and using technology
and knowledge more effectively and efficiently, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that a further challenge in developing alternative
financing sources is the development of the insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
As a mobilizer of long-term savings, the insurance industry is
an ideal and natural source of financing for long-term investment
and it should be utilized more effectively, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said access to fund for priority sectors such as the small
and medium-scaled enterprises was crucial to ensure that they
develop to become the backbone to the economy.

<HEADLINE> Talks With India, Pakistan Encouraging: Bangladeshi Foreign Secretary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Foreign Secretary C.M.
Shafi Sami Monday said that his talks with India and Pakistan for
peace and stability in South Asia were "encouraging" and the
process of consultation would continue.
</P>
<P>
"We feel encouraged by seeing responses from both sides after
the talks," the foreign secretary told a press conference at the
Foreign Office on conclusion of his Pakistan mission.
</P>
<P>
Sami went to Islamabad as special envoy of Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina on August 22 and held talks with Pakistan's Chief
Executive General Pervez Musharraf on regional issues, including
holding of the stalled South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC)summit.
</P>
<P>
On his trip to New Delhi early this month, he held talks with
Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee on the same topic.
</P>
<P>
In reply to a question, Sami said he did not give any specific
proposal during his meetings with Vajpayee and General Musharraf,
but some specific proposals would come up through the process of
consultations, he added.
</P>
<P>
"I can say at the moment that process of consultation at the
behest of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina began and it would continue,
" the foreign secretary said.
</P>
<P>
About the possibility of holding of SAARC summit, Sami said the
SAARC secretary general recently visited the seven member states
of the forum. A technical committee would start working shortly
and in the process, meetings of SAARC foreign secretaries and
foreign ministers would be held, paving the way for the summit
meet.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed the idea that Bangladesh undertook current
initiative to reactivate SAARC and restore peace in the region at
the desire of the United States.
</P>
<P>
"I say in categorical terms that Bangladesh government's
decisions are taken in line with the objectives of the country's
own foreign policy, not at the will of any external power," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Sami said the purpose of his trip to India and Pakistan was to
convey concern and perception of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina
about peace and stability in the region to the leaders of the two
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Hasina would hold bilateral talks with Vajpayee and General
Musharraf in New York on the sidelines of UN millennium summit to
be held in the first week of September, he added.

<HEADLINE> Update: Burundian Parties Sign Historic Peace Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Zhang Dacheng
</P>
<P>
ARUSHA, Tanzania, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Thirteen of the 19
warring parties of Burundi signed a historic peace agreement aimed
at ending the seven-year-old civil war in the landlocked central
African country on Monday in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha.
</P>
<P>
Among the signatories are the Burundi government, the Burundi
National Assembly, seven Hutu parties and four major Tutsi parties.
However, there are still six Tutsi parties which refuse to sign
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The 175-page Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement for
Burundi contains five protocols on the nature of the conflicts,
democracy and good governance, peace and security, reconstruction
and development, and guarantees on agreement implementation.
</P>
<P>
The agreement says that after the signing ceremony,
transitional institutions will be established within six months
including a transitional government of national unity, and general
elections will be held within 30 months to form a new government.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, a National Assembly and a Senate
will be set up on an ethnically balanced basis and the defense and
security forces reorganized with integration of the Hutu rebels
into the minority Tutsi dominated army on the same basis.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also provides for the release of political
prisoners, trial of genocide suspects, civilian disarmament,
resettlement of refugees as well as economic and social
development.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations-led Implementation Committee will be
established with all the signatories and representatives of
regional and international organizations involved to ensure
effective implementation of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
A National Truth and Reconciliation Committee will also be set
up to investigate genocide, war and other crimes in a bid to
realize national reconciliation and ethical equality and mutual
respect.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was cosigned by facilitator for Burundian peace
talks and former South African president Nelson Mandela, heads of
state in the Great Lakes region and representatives of the United
Nations, the Organization of African Unity, the European Union and
the International Organization of la Francophonie.
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony was witnessed by a dozen of heads of state
and government from Africa, Europe and America, including U.S.
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the signing ceremony at the Arusha International
Conference Center, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and chairman
of the signing ceremony said the signing of the agreement is open
and any party which has not signed yet is welcome to sign it.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, Chairman of the Organization of
African Unity and Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema said to
realize peace in Burundi is not a matter of Burundi alone, but a
matter of the whole Africa.
</P>
<P>
On his side, Mandela said he has always been optimistic about
the peace process in Burundi. "We will soon move the base of our
facilitating team to Bujumbura, capital of Burundi, to explain to
the Burundi people what we have done," he said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ceremony, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi noted
that security can not be protected by gun but by the people' s
confidence. He described gun as the enemy of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Burundian President Pierre Buyoya, who signed the peace
agreement on behalf of his government, also addressed the ceremony
and said "today is another important day in the history of Burundi.
"
</P>
<P>
According to Mandela's assistant Judge Bomani, although the
agreement was signed only by 13 of the 19 warring Burundi parties,
the facilitating team will begin its implementation starting from
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Burundi peace talks, which was initiated by late Tanzanian
president Julius Nyerere in June 1998, made little progress until
Mandela succeeded Nyerere as the facilitator in December 1999
following the latter's death of leukemia.
</P>
<P>
More than 200,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in
the country since civil war erupted in October 1993 when Burundi's
first democratically elected president Melchior Ndadaye, who was
from the majority Hutu ethnic group, was assassinated by pro-Tutsi
soldiers.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Twelve people were killed in a
road accident on Monday when a bus collided with a min-truck near
Naivasha, 80 kilometers northwest of Kenya's capital Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The victims were passengers on the bus and died on the spot,
police said.
</P>
<P>
According to the truck driver, who had a broken arm, the bus
was overtaking another when the accident occurred.
</P>
<P>
This was the fourth accident in the east African country in the
past one week. Two days ago, six people waiting for a bus were
killed near Naivasha when a vehicle lost control and ran across
them.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday a car-bus collision near the Indian port city
Mombasa killed seven people. Last Thursday at least 37 people died
after a bus plunged off the bridge into a river in central Kenya.

CAIRO, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Visiting Sudanese Foreign Trade Minister Mekki Ali
Blail on Tuesday invited Turkish companies to invest in Sudan,
Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Blail, who heads a delegation to the ongoing Izmir International
Trade Fair, said that by so doing, those firms can reach out to 21
African countries due to the customs union formed by East and South
African countries.
</P>
<P>
The annual trade volume between Turkey and Sudan is around 30
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Sudan, rich in raw materials, provides ample
opportunities in such sectors as cotton, oil, fruit, vegetable,
timber, animal breeding, fishing and mine.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The Emirates Airline is considering the option of
tapping the international financial markets to finance its future
expansion plans, said Ahmed bin Saaed Al Maktoum, president of the
Dubai Civil Aviation Department and chairman of the Emirates Group.
</P>
<P>
Emirates would issue international deposit certificates worth
about 3.5 billion U.S. dollars on the London Stock Exchange, said
Ahmed. And the airline may issue international bonds to fund the
acquisition of new aircraft when the airline is due to take
delivery of these.
</P>
<P>
The financing through international markets is expected to go
side by side with normal financing through bank loans, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, the group has to explore new and less costly methods to
boost its success in the future, said the official.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The "International Ready-to-Wear Fair" will be held at
the International Fair Center in Istanbul on October 13-15.
</P>
<P>
Mahmut Abra, coordinator of the Textile Fairs Section of
Istanbul Fair Organization, said that Turkey exported 50,000 tons
of clothes worth 2.5 billion U.S. dollars to Germany in 1998, and
exported 60,000 tons of clothes in 1999, but again earned 2.5
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The figures showed that there were certain problems in Turkey's
ready-to-wear sector.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Turkish clothing sector should diversify its
products, pay more attention to sale promotion and adopt a flexible
price policy to cater the changing market.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The value of re-exports from Abu Dhabi of the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) rose to 100.9 million dirhams (27.6
million U.S. dollars) in July, up 30 percent from 70.8 million
dirhams (19.3 million dollars) in July last year.
</P>
<P>
All major re-export markets showed a healthy rise in business,
with Iran on top of the list, which absorbed 24.9 million dirhams
(6.8 million dollars) in July compared to 7.96 million dirhams (2.
17 million dollars) in July, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Re-exports to Qatar, Egypt, India, Kuwait, Singapore and Britain
more than doubled, according to statistics released by the Abu
Dhabi Customs Department on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey's First International Handicrafts and Souvenirs
Fair started on Monday in the Tarsus township of southern Icel
province.
</P>
<P>
A total of 53 firms from the Philippines, Iran, Pakistan, India,
Indonesia, Kenya, China and China's Taiwan are participating in the
fair.

establishment of a bizonal, bicommunal unified state of Cyprus,
Armenian ambassador to Cyprus, Armen Petrosyan, said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Presenting his credentials to Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides,
Petrosyan said that Armenia closely follows recent developments on
the island and that a stronger and unified Cyprus will play a
greater role in the international arena.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the Mediterranean island after an abortive coup
seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island with
a bicommunal bizonal federation formula but no substantive progress
have been made so far.
</P>
<P>
his government gives great importance to
further developing of the friendly relations of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Petrosyan praised today's Cyprus as a showcase of remarkable
achievements and said that Cyprus "performed miracles and won
worldwide respect for the way it has managed to provide for the
security and welfare of its citizens."
</P>
<P>
Clerides said on the occasion that his government all along
seeks a peaceful, just, viable and lasting solution to the Cyprus
issue, based on the U.N. resolutions which call for a bicommunal,
bizonal, federal state.
</P>
<P>
Petrosyan also expressed his country's support to Cyprus'
efforts to join the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, along with Slovenia, Hungary, Poland, Estonia and the
Czech Republic started substantive accession negotiations with the
EU in November 1998. It hopes to be admitted as an EU member in
EU's first wave of enlargement.

<TEXT>
<P>
Wednesday will be the first anniversary of the popular
consultation in East Timor, in which the East Timorese people
voted overwhelmingly for independence.
</P>
<P>
In a video message to the Timorese people, Annan said helping
East Timor become independent is "one of the greatest
responsibilities ever given to the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
"We are working as true partners in every field, fostering
economic development, promoting tolerance and reconciliation,
creating a civil service, rebuilding infrastructure and preparing
the election that will enable you to start on the road of true and
lasting self-government," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"I know that there is still much hardship and suffering; that
there still be East Timorese in exile, waiting to return; that
progress has not happened as quickly as we would have hoped," the
U.N. chief noted.
</P>
<P>
"You have the creativity, the determination and the ability to
succeed in building the nation for which so many of you have
sacrificed so much," Annan added.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Denies FARC Controlling 40 Pct Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Colombian Defense Minister Luis
Fernando Ramirez Tuesday denied the report that the rebel
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) controls 40 percent
of the national territory.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian Minister made the denial to the report of "the
Washington Post."
</P>
<P>
"These allegations are absolutely false, they do not tally with
reality," local broadcasting station, RCN, quoted the minister as
saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ramirez said "these newspaper comments almost always feed upon
slanted reports, but in no way do FARC control 40 percent of
Colombia."
</P>
<P>
The Colombian government created in 1999 a buffer zone and
demilitarized a 42,139 square kilometer area in five
municipalities of Meta and Caqueta departments, southern Colombia,
for a peace process with FARC.
</P>
<P>
This tract of land is a tiny part of the national total (3.6
percent) and this American daily's reports are "absolutely false,"
the official said.
</P>
<P>
The rebel group, which numbers about 12,000 fighters, has
affirmed on several occasions it is present "in all the country",
not only in the southern demilitarized area, where a peace talk
with President Pastrana's government is taking place.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM Refutes U.S. Warns of Security Risk in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister and
Foreign Minister Salim Hoss Tuesday rejected the warns of U.S.
State Department of security risk in Lebanon, National News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
"We do not agree with the U.S. State Department's position of
warning American's visit to Lebanon. The security situation is
stable that can be seen by all of us here," Hoss said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"So we do not think the warns are positive and we hope American
authority can retreat it," the premier added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department warned Americans on Monday of risks
while traveling to and in Lebanon and urged U.S. citizens in Beirut
to take special security precautions.
</P>
<P>
A State Department statement cited continued instability,
particularly in the southern suburbs of Beirut, parts of the Bekaa
Valley, Palestinian refugee camps and the Lebanon-Israel border,
but did not single out a specific event or "incident" as having
prompted the warning.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the department said that in case of such
hazards U.S. officials may be unable to help, saying that the
situation is still unstable in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"The Department of State warns U.S. citizens of the risks of
travel to Lebanon and recommends that Americans exercise caution
while traveling there," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Festival of Mutual Understanding Slated for September in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Political party leaders and
representatives from both Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides met here
Tuesday and agreed to organize a festival on mutual understanding
between the two communities on the divided island next month.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which was held at Ledra Palace hotel in the U.N.-
controlled buffer zone, was organized by the Slovak embassy here.
Slovak Ambassador Dusan Rozbora acted as coordinator of the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement read out by Rozbora after the meeting said
that the meeting was held in a positive and cooperative atmosphere,
the Cyprus News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It added that the party leaders and representatives "examined
all preparatory committee meetings and decided to go forward with
organizing the festival of mutual understanding on September 10" at
the Ledra Palace.
</P>
<P>
And they also agreed to meet again on October 16.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's meeting was attended by leaders or representatives of
four Greek Cypriot parties, the right-wing Democratic Rally, left-
wing AKEL, the Movement of Social Democrats and the United
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
From the Turkish Cypriot side, also four parties sent their
leaders or representatives to the meeting, the Democratic Party,
the Republican Turkish Party, the Communal Liberation Party and the
Patriotic Unity Movement.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides
since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the northern third of
the island after a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for years to bring the two sides back
together into a bizonal bicommunal federation.
</P>
<P>
But the Turkish Cypriot regime in northern Cyprus, backed by
Ankara, insists on the establishment of a confederation of two
states on the island.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy Briefs Barak on Clinton-Mubarak Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Mideast special envoy
Dennis Ross briefed Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak Tuesday
afternoon on the meeting between U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo earlier Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who visited Egypt as a stop-off after an African tour,
talked with Mubarak for 90 minutes at Cairo International Airport,
trying to launch a U.S.-Egyptian drive to narrow gaps between
Israel and the Palestinians for reaching an agreement.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who spent recent days in Israel for vacation and
accompanied Clinton in Cairo, told Barak that during the meeting,
Mubarak pledged to contribute his maximum efforts and all necessary
assistance to help the two sides to reach a compromise, especially
on the issue of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Mubarak, who had played a significant role
in the mediation, had raised some "new ideas" regarding the status
of Jerusalem in the past week.
</P>
<P>
The issue has been the major sticking point between the two
sides as Israel claims the holy city as its "eternal and undivided
capital," while the Palestinians want Arab East Jerusalem, which
Israel occupied in the 1967 Mideast war, as the capital of their
future state.
</P>
<P>
Last month's Camp David summit, attended by Barak, Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and Clinton, collapsed mainly due to
differences over the status of Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Arafat has launched marathon diplomatic efforts to
explicate his positions to world leaders, and tried to formulate a
unified Arab stand on the issue during Monday's meeting of the
Jerusalem Committee of the Organization of the Islamic Conference
in Morocco.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Ross, Barak reiterated Israeli stands
regarding the peace process in general, and on the Jerusalem issue
in particular, a statement issued by Barak's office said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said, according to the statement, that he is
looking forward to more openness and flexibility from the
Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Barak's office said that word in Jerusalem is that
if the Palestinians present a new stance on the issue of Jerusalem,
a new summit will be possible.
</P>
<P>
Barak added that at the current stage, the chances for reaching
an Israeli-Palestinian peace accord are 50 to 50, and he really did
not know if the possibility for ending the 52-year-long conflicts
between Israel and the Palestinians could be realized.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the Clinton-Mubarak meeting, Ross also said that
it is possible for both sides to reach an agreement, but the
difficulty is in translating a possibility into reality.
</P>
<P>
Ross and Barak agreed to meet again Wednesday night. Notably,
Mubarak will also meet with Arafat on Wednesday, which is their
sixth meeting since the failed Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
Barak and Arafat will both travel to New York next week to
attend the United Nations Millenium summit, on the sidelines of
which they will meet with Clinton separately. There is no plan for
the three to hold another three-way summit, Barak's office
clarified on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Israeli Justice Minister Yossi Beilin
said Tuesday that the Jerusalem issue is only a semasiological
problem, suggesting that constructive diplomatic language was the
key to resolving the dispute.
</P>
<P>
"The main point is what to call the status quo because everyone
knows there will be no real change in the status quo," Beilin told
Israel's Army Radio.
</P>
<P>
Israel controls most parts of Jerusalem, but the Temple Mount in
the stone-walled Old City, which is both Jewish and Muslim holiest
site, was under the hands of Waqf, a Palestinian religious group.
</P>
<P>
"The question is only what will be the diplomatic title for the
situation that will be created when there will be peace here. When
it's titles that are being discussed, it seems to me that it's not
impossible to bridge the gaps which still exist," he added.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Student Group Vows to Remain Calm Despite Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran's largest pro-reform student
group, the Office to Foster Unity (OFU), said here on Tuesday that
it will continue "remaining calm" despite the violent attacks its
members have suffered in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
The pro-reform students will remain calm and avoid anarchism, as
called for by President Mohammad Khatami and other reformist
leaders, said members of the OFU Central Council at a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
They also pledged to stick to an "active peace policy" and
respond to even armed attacks of the violent seekers with a smile,
the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The organization held its annual conference in Khoramabad,
capital of the western Lorestan province, last week, which
triggered a series of political violence. A police officer was
killed and dozens were injured in the clashes between supporters
and opponents of the group.
</P>
<P>
The OFU was forced to cut short its conference because of the
disturbance by conservative radicals, who not only attacked the
pro-reform students but also stormed local government offices. The
governor-general of the province was also beaten and injured.
</P>
<P>
Reformers close to Khatami have bitterly criticized the violent
attacks, which were clearly organized and supported by the Basij
(voluntary Islamic militia) and the elite Islamic Revolution Guards
Corps, under direct control of the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
Members of the OFU Central Council said some 100 students were
wounded in attacks by the conservative radicals. They cited some
names and vehicle number plates and claimed that some "known
elements" were involved in beating the students.
</P>
<P>
Ali Afshari, a member of the council, said the recent
conservative attacks marked the start of a new phase of the policy
of suppression and obstruction which is aimed at containing the
pro-reform student movement.
</P>
<P>
But the conservative radicals should know that they will not
necessarily be the final winners of such a policy, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he expressed disappointment that Khatami's government
is not in control of the military and security forces, so they lack
the effective levers to deal with the conservative radicals.
</P>
<P>
Political conflicts between Iran's reformist and conservative
camps have escalated since the February parliamentary election, in
which reformers won an overwhelming victory, bringing to an end the
long-time conservative control over the legislative body.
</P>
<P>
Although the conservatives have lost control of the executive
and legislative branches of the system, they still control most of
the other important state organs, including the judiciary, the
armed forces and state radio and televisions.
</P>
<P>
In the past few months, the conservative judiciary has ordered
to close down more than 20 pro-reform papers and journals and
imprisoned a number of reformist figures on charges of violating
Islamic principles and advocating American-style reforms.
</P>
<P>
Conservative radicals, particularly members of the Ansar-e
Hezbollah (Friends of God Party) and the Basij, have frequently
launched violent attacks on pro-reform allies and beat students and
people attending the reformist rallies.
</P>
<P>
In face of the powerful conservative offensive, Khatami and his
reformist allies have urged reformist supporters to exercise
restraint in case the situation gets out of control, which is
clearly to the benefit of the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
However, as the 2001 presidential election draws near and
Khatami announces his intention to run for a second term, the
conservatives heighten pressures on the reformers to avoid another
humiliating defeat. Khatami and his allies will have to face
tougher tests in the months to come.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Court Rejects Former Minister's Last Appeal for Delaying Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Supreme Court on
Tuesday
rejected former interior minister Aryeh Deri's last appeal for
postponing his entry into the prison for religious and family
reasons.
</P>
<P>
According to a ruling written by Supreme Court President Aharon
Barak, Deri, who was the first former cabinet minister ever
sentenced to prison terms in the country, should go to jail next
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Deri, once leader of the ultra-Orthodox religious Shas party and

a charismatic political star, was convicted on charges of bribery
taking, breach of trust and fraud while he served as the interior
minister in the 1980s and was sentenced to four years in prison in
March 1999.
</P>
<P>
His prison terms was reduced to three years after a Supreme
Court rehearing, which nevertheless upheld most of his convictions
and ordered that he begin severing his service on August 13.
</P>
<P>
However, an appeal for second hearing deferred the date again
and after judge Barak rejected Deri's appeal last week, the date
for his entry into prison was finally slated for next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
But on Monday, Deri's attorney again asked the court to delay
the execution of his prison terms until after the biggest Jewish
holidays in September and October, including the Jewish New Year
and Yom Kippur.
</P>
<P>
In the request, lawyer Nevot Tel Tzur argued that Deri, "who is
being forced to cut himself off from his family for a long time,
wants to ease the suffering of his wife and children and be with
them during the holidays."
</P>
<P>
However, Deputy State Prosecutor Yehoshua Reznick said that a
court may further postpone the beginning of a sentence "only for
special reasons." The holidays, he added, do not qualify as "
special reasons."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Reznick said, acceding to Deri's request would violate
the principle of equality under the law.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that large masses of Shas supporters are
planning to accompany Deri to jail and launched a series of protest
against the sentence.
</P>
<P>
The party, who holds 17 seats in Israel's 120-member Knesset
(parliament), is a pivotal political force in Israel's society,
which had been plagued by the widening gap between the secular and
the religious in recent years.

<P>
HARARE, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean parliamentarian Giles
Mutsekwa Tuesday called for the immediate withdrawal of the
Zimbabwean soldiers from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
, saying their continued presence is derailing the peace process
in that country.
</P>
<P>
He told Parliament that the DRC war was costing the Zimbabwean
government 1.3 million U.S. dollars a day, and was the main cause
of the Zimbabwean government's overrun on expenditure, the
Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Our intervention has prolonged the suffering of the masses of
that country," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said if Zimbabwe had not maintained its presence in the DRC,
the DRC President Laurent Kabila could have long been forced to a
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
For as long as Zimbabwe maintained its troops in the DRC,
Kabila would not require a peaceful settlement to the DRC war, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has about 11,000 soldiers in the DRC where they are
supporting Kabila under siege from rebels backed by Uganda and
Rwanda.

<HEADLINE> British Officer Meets S.Leonean Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 29 (Xinhua) -- A British army officer has held a
face-to-face meeting with the Sierra Leonean rebels for the
release of the abducted soldiers, according to a report reaching
here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the British military mission in Sierra Leone
was quoted as saying in Freetown, capital of the war-torn west
African country, that Colonel Simon Fordham of the Royal Irish
Regiment met Colonel Kallay, one of the leaders of the West Side
Boys, the abductors of the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Fordham went for the meeting with the company of Major
Johnny Paul Koroma, a former military junta who is now a member of
the Sierra Leonean Government, said the spokesman who declined to
deliberate the further details of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers, 11 British and one Sierra Leonean, were captured
by the West Side Boys last Friday when they were patrolling along
the Freetown-Masiaka highway.
</P>
<P>
The West Side Boys earlier set conditions for the release of
the soldiers, demanding for food, medicine and the release of one
of their leaders from the government's prison.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said the Sierra Leonean government and the
United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) were also in
negotiations with the rebel group for the safe return of the 12
abducted soldiers, who were said to be well treated and in good
conditions.

LAGOS, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leonean Minister of Foreign
Affairs and International Cooperation Sama Banya Tuesday
reaffirmed that one-China policy has been the cornerstone of the
west African country to develop the bilateral relationship with

Sierra Leone in need and provided valued support to the country,

Banya further stressed that Sierra Leone and China have been
enjoying a good and brotherly relationship in the past three

<HEADLINE> Some Legal International Instruments Fail to Attract Universal Participation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.N. official Tuesday
said 500 multilateral treaties have so far been deposited with
United Nations since its inception in 1945 although some of them
still have to succeed in attracting universal participation.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Information Center Director Christine Koerner was
addressing participants to a one-day seminar in Harare organized
by the Zimbabwean National Organization of Non-Governmental
Organizations on the forthcoming United Nations Millennium Forum.
</P>
<P>
The seminar discussed recommendations and feed-back from the
NGO sector on issues concerning the civil society in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Koerner said, "It is with this in mind that the United Nations
Secretary-General has invited Heads of State and Government,
during the upcoming Millennium Summit, to consider signing and
ratifying or acceding to the treaties deposited."
</P>
<P>
"By becoming party to these multilateral treaties, states would
contribute significantly to the advancement of the rule of law and
the cause of peace," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said it was particularly encouraging to note that there had
been growing participation in the body of treaties most central to
the spirit and goals of the Charter of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
In many cases, Koerner said, the absence of ratification or
accession to a treaty did not reflect a lack of interest on the
part of governments.
</P>
<P>
She said instead it might be caused by lack of resources,
including the necessary technical expertise, for becoming a party
to a multilateral convention.
</P>
<P>
She said the U.N. stood ready to provide such technical
assistance.
</P>
<P>
In preparation of the Millennium Summit, she said, the
Secretary-General had identified a core group of 25 multinational
treaties which reflected the key policy goals of the U.N. and the
spirit of the Charter.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Says Burundi Peace Deal Signing Historic for Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The international
facilitator for Burundi peace talks, former South African
president Nelson Mandela has described the signing of the Burundi
Peace Accord on Monday night in Tanzania's northern town of Arusha
as a historic day for Africa, media here reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We've done it today. The 28th August, 2000 is a momentous day
not only for Burundi but for the whole of Africa," said Mandela
during his closing remarks at the ceremony, which was witnessed by
U.S. President Bill Clinton and 12 African leaders.
</P>
<P>
He said the 13 men who put their signatures to accept peace
have written their names in gold for history to judge them.
</P>
<P>
However, five Tutsi parties refused to sign the power-sharing
accord on grounds that more time was needed to study the peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Mandela reiterated he was moving the peace process to Bujumbura
where an office will be established to make follow-ups on the
peace deal.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, was already
considering sending peacekeepers to Burundi, he added.
</P>
<P>
In his about 30 minutes speech, Mandela supported the rebel
groups argument that ceasefire can only come into force if a peace
agreement was in place.
</P>
<P>
Burundi's three main armed Hutu rebel groups were not even
represented at the talks. They say they support its aims but have
no intention of declaring an immediate ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, one of the rebel groups, CNDD-FDD, conveyed its
apology to Mandela for its inability to attend the signing
ceremony, but assured that they would consider ending hostilities
once a peace agreement was signed.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between Burundi's minority Tutsis and majority Hutus
has claimed the lives of around 200,000 people, mostly civilians,
since the first democratically elected president, Melchior Ndadaye,
a Hutu, was assassinated by Tutsi paratroopers in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The peace deal signed on Monday calls for a three-year
transition period during which democratic elections will be
organized and Hutus will be given equal representation in the army,
which is currently dominated by Tutsis.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Confidence Retreats In August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. consumer confidence
fell in August after rebounding in July, The Conference Board said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board, a prominent business research group, said
in a survey that the Consumer Confidence Index now stands at 141.1
down from a revised 143.0 in July and well below the record level
of 144.7 in January and May.
</P>
<P>
"The recent fluctuations may indicate that confidence levels
have reached a plateau, and a cooling in spending habits may well
be on the horizon," said Lynn Franco, director of The Conference
Board's Consumer Research Center. "Despite the decline in
confidence, consumers' attitudes about future economic growth
prospects remain upbeat."
</P>
<P>
Consumers' assessment of current economic conditions were mixed.
The percentage of survey participants that felt business
conditions were "good" rose to 46.3 percent from 45.4 percent last
month while those rating conditions as "bad" climbed to 8.3
percent from 7.3 percent, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
The Consumer Confidence Index is based on a representative
sample of 5,000 U.S. households. The index is widely watched as a
barometer of the U.S. economy in the next six months because
consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's
economic activities.
</P>
<P>
The short-term outlook was also mixed, the survey said. The
percentage of participants expecting an improvement in business
conditions during the next six months improved slightly to 17.4
percent from 17.2 percent in the previous survey but the
proportion of consumers expecting more jobs to become available in
the coming months declined to 16.8 percent from 17.6 percent in
July.

<HEADLINE> Government Urged to Spend More to Fight Racism in Switzerland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- A Swiss parliamentary group
against racism and xenophobia has called on the federal government
to increase the anti-racism commission's capacity to fight
intolerance in the country, according to a Swiss Radio
International report.
</P>
<P>
In the statement on Monday, the group said that it was alarmed
at the growth of right-wing extremism, and that more had to be
done to combat intolerance.
</P>
<P>
Over the last few years, the group has repeated that the anti-
racism commission's budget of 150,000 Swiss francs (about 88,000 U.
S. dollars) is insufficient. The group has demanded that the
budget be increased in 2001 to effectively combat neo-nazi
activities.
</P>
<P>
The call comes amid rising concern about an increase in violent
right-wing extremism. On Sunday, four people were injured after a
violent confrontation between 50 skinheads and 80 members of the
African Club in the Swiss canton of St Gallen.
</P>
<P>
Last week the Justice Minister, Ruth Metzler, called for people
to be vigilant towards the extremists.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the organisation "Open Hearts" and the Zurich
parliamentarian, Roland Wiederkehr, have announced plans to lead a
national demonstration against right-wing extremism in the capital
of Berne on September 15 or 16.

<HEADLINE> EU Hails Burundi Peace Agreement Signed in Arusha As Important Step </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) Tuesday
hailed the peace agreement signed on Monday by some of the
belligerent groups of Burundi in Arusha, Tanzania, as an important
step to put an end to a civil strife which has killed 200,000
people in seven years.
</P>
<P>
The EU rotating presidency state, France, said in a published
statement that the agreement is a new and important step on the
way toward national reconciliation in the central African state.
</P>
<P>
"EU congratulates (former South African) President (Nelson)
Mandela, the team of mediation and Burundian negotiators for their
efforts which allowed the holding on Monday of the summit of
Arusha consecrated to Burundi," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
EU calls for an immediate stop to the fighting in the country,
in which the main victims are civilians, it said.
</P>
<P>
EU will support the peace process in the country and provide
its aid for its rehabilitation and development, the statement
added.
</P>
<P>
Peace in Burundi is still far from being realized because six
armed groups, including two main Hutu groups fighting against the
Tutsi-dominated government, have not signed the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Several heads of state, including U.S. President Bill Clinton,
were present at the signing ceremony, while EU was represented by
French Minister-Delegate of Cooperation Charles Josselin.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Police Uncover Illegal Weapons Deal with Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Swiss police have uncovered a
secret weapons deal, in which anti-tank artillery and ammunition
were sent to Albania to aid the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army in
their struggle against Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Local reports quoted the Swiss Federal Prosecutor's Office as
saying Tuesday that the weapons worth 2.6 million U.S. dollars
were sent to Albania during the summer of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The delivery was arranged by Kosovo Albanians, resident in
Switzerland, with the assistance of two business people, one Swiss
and one French, according to the reports. They helped the Kosovars
to secure the weapons and send them to Albania under false papers.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor's office said two people had been arrested in
connection with the case, but it gave no further details about
their involvement or identities.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor's office has now handed the case over to the
Geneva cantonal authorities, who assisted in the investigation.

<HEADLINE> Religious Leaders Urged to Prevent Religions From Being Misused </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 29 (Xinhua) -- A religions leader
Tuesday said people of different religious persuasions, religious
leaders in particular, need to join hands to adequately address
the current problems and challenges in the world, and that they
must shoulder the duty to prevent their religions from being
misused.
</P>
<P>
The statement was contained in a speech delivered at the
Millennium World Peace Summit of Religious and Spiritual Leaders
by Francis Cardinal Arinze, president of the Pontifical Council
for Interreligious Dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"There are problems and challenges which demand collaboration
between people of different religious persuasions, if they are to
be adequately addressed," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Some people abuse or exploit religion in order to promote
violence," he said. "Often their real motivations are political,
economic or ethnic in nature."
</P>
<P>
"It may be a question of injustices suffered by past
generations and hitherto not adequately healed," he said. "It
could be a case of sheer selfishness, greed or pride."
</P>
<P>
"People of religion, especially religious leaders, have a duty
to see that religion is not misused in this way."
</P>
<P>
"There is also the challenge of poverty. The homeless, the
unemployed, the sick and those groaning under the burden of
grinding poverty, crushing underdevelopment or even heavier
external debts -- these people are crying for attention if we are
to install genuine peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty not addressed can lead to dehumanization and despair,
" he said. "A hungry person can easily become an angry person and
a ready tool in the hands of those who advocate violence and
conflict."
</P>
<P>
"There is, moreover, the challenge of solidarity," he said. "
Interdependence is a fact. We need one another at the level of
individuals, professions, provinces, states, countries and
cultures."
</P>
<P>
"When interdependence is freely accepted and generous lived,
when it is not exploited or merely tolerated, evolves into the
moral virtue of solidarity," he said. "Richer individuals and
nations then better realize their duties toward the poorer because
of the destination of earthly goods."
</P>
<P>
"Many religious bodies are showing their concern for the poor
and are engaged in concrete action," he said. "Yet this is not
enough. Pressure needs to be put on governments to respond more
adequately in redressing the imbalances to be found in the world
today."
</P>
<P>
"Collaboration between people of all the religions of the
world is needed for the proper motivation of hearts and
consciences, so that these problems and challenges can be faced
effectively," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Millennium World Peace Summit Monday kicked off at the U.N.
headquarters in New York, attracting more than 1,000 religious
leaders worldwide, including seven top gurus of China's five major
faith disciplines, who gathered here to forge partnerships of
peace with the United Nations and each other.
</P>
<P>
All the world's major religions and faiths are represented at
the event, "the millennium World Peace Summit of Religious and
Spiritual Leaders," the organizers said.
</P>
<P>
The four-day summit is expected to focus on four broad sets of
issues: conflict transformation, elimination of poverty,
forgiveness and reconciliation, and preservation and restoration
of environment.
</P>
<P>
The summit brought together recognized religious and spiritual
figures including religious leaders from current zones of conflict
-- such as Sierra Leone, the Balkans, Indonesia, Ethiopia,
Philippines, Rwanda and Sudan -- to discuss the roles they can
play in reducing religious tensions, the organizers said.
</P>
<P>
The summit is being convened by an independent group of
interfaith leaders, religious scholars and theologians.

<HEADLINE> China Attaches Importance to Top Legislators' Millennium Meeting: Li Peng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 29 (Xinhua) -- China attaches great importance
to the upcoming millennium meeting of the parliamentary leaders,
which will provide an important opportunity for strengthening
cooperation among the parliaments of countries around the world,
Li Peng, the top Chinese legislator, said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Chinese National
People's Congress (NPC), made the remarks during his meeting with
Anders Johnsson, secretary general of the Inter-Parliamentary
Union (IPU).
</P>
<P>
The millennium meeting of the parliamentary leaders, officially
known as the Conference of Presiding Officers of National
Parliaments, is to start here on Wednesday, is a milestone event
for the IPU, Li said.
</P>
<P>
As a vice-chairman of the meeting, Li promised that he would
collaborate actively with the chairman and other vice-chairmen to
contribute to the success of the conference.
</P>
<P>
Diversified as the world is, Li said he expected parliamentary
leaders from countries around the world to express their
diversified opinions on world affairs at the conference.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, he said China hoped that all the problems and
differences in opinions would be settled through dialogue. The
millennium meeting would indeed serve as a platform for
parliamentary leaders to exchange opinions and to strengthen their
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Johnsson agreed with Li and said that the conference would be
an unprecedented meeting of great historical importance. It
signifies a greater involvement of peoples of all countries around
the globe in the world affairs and provides a base for cooperation
among national parliaments and that between the IPU and the United
Nations, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that he fully agreed with Li Peng on the point
that consensus on issues facing the world should be reached
through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The foundation of the IPU as an international organization is
nothing but dialogue, he noted, adding that it is only through
dialogue can the purpose of safeguarding world peace be attained.

<TEXT>
<P>
Underscoring the importance for the parties to remain genuinely
committed to the implementation of the agreement, signed on August
28, the U.N. chief reiterated his support to the objectives of the
agreement and for the efforts by the facilitator Nelson Mandela,
former South African president, Annan's spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Annan regretted that not all parties have signed the agreement
and he urged those that have not signed to do so as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen of the 19 warring parties of Burundi signed the accord
aimed at ending the seven-year-old civil war in the landlocked
central African country.
</P>
<P>
Among the signatories are the Burundi Government, the Burundi
National Assembly, seven Hutu parties and four major Tutsi parties.
However, there are still six Tutsi parties refusing to sign the
pact.
</P>
<P>
The Burundi peace talks, initiated by late Tanzanian president
Julius Nyerere in June 1998, made little progress until Mandela
succeeded Nyerere as the facilitator in December 1999 following
the latter's death of leukemia.
</P>
<P>
More than 200,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in
the country since civil war erupted in October 1993 when Burundi's
first democratically-elected president Melchior Ndadaye was
assassinated by pro-Tutsi soldiers.

<P>
JERUSALEM, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's Office Tuesday denied reports that he ever has a plan to
meet with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at the United Nations
Millenium Summit in New York next month.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, reports quoted Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil
Shaath as saying in Cairo that Arafat and Barak would meet on
September 6 on the sidelines to the U.N. Summit.
</P>
<P>
The report also added that U.S. President Bill Clinton, who is
also scheduled to attend the meeting, might join in and a three-way
summit in the style of last month's Camp David summit will take
place.
</P>
<P>
However, Barak's office said in a short statement: "In reaction
to reports from Cairo the prime minister's media adviser wishes to
make clear that no meeting has been set between Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Yasser Arafat."
</P>
<P>
It was reported later that Shaath also denied the rumor,
claiming that he had been misquoted and there were no plans for the
two leaders to meet.
</P>
<P>
The only meetings concerning the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process in New York, he added, will be separate talks between
Clinton and the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
Barak and Arafat had not held meetings since the Camp David
talks, which attended by the two and Clinton, failed to reach an
agreement last month due to significant gaps over the Jerusalem
issue and the Palestinian refugee issue.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Provide Visa Services at Border Points </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Tourists from Jordan's neighboring
countries can get Jordanian visas at border points as of September
1, Jordanian officials said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The new measure was aimed at attracting more tourists from
neighboring countries to raise Jordan's tourism revenues to 1
billion U.S. dollars in the year 2000 from 900 million dollars in
1999 which saw 1.2 million tourist arrivals.
</P>
<P>
Tourism remains as one of the three major foreign currency
earners of the desert kingdom alongside labor exports and foreign
financial assistances.
</P>
<P>
The government headed by Prime Minister Ali Abu Ragheb has also
decided to simplify the visa and residence card application
procedures for potential investors among the tourists.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior Awad Khleifat
said earlier this week that his ministry has set up an investment
promotion office, specifically in charge of issuing one-stop visas
and residence visas to foreign investors who will get the documents
within one day or at most two days instead of two weeks under the
normal procedure.

on such teachings."
</P>
<P>
"There is no mystery here. Such values are deeply ingrained in
the human spirit itself. It is little wonder that the same values
animate the Charter of the United Nations, and lie at the root of
our search of world peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. Charter, the world body has the primary
responsibility for the maintenance of world peace and security.
</P>
<P>
At the four-day summit, all the world's major religions and
faiths are represented at the event. The summit focuses on four
broad sets of issues: conflict transformation, elimination of
poverty, forgiveness and reconciliation, and preservation and
restoration of environment.
</P>
<P>
"Today's meeting is also an opportunity for religious,
spiritual and political leaders, as well as their followers, to
look within, and to consider what they can do to promote justice,
equality, reconciliation and peace," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"Men and women of faith are a strong influence on group and
individual conduct," he said. "As teachers and guides, you can be
powerful agents for change. You can inspire people to new levels
of commitment and public service. You can help bridge the chasms
of ignorance, fear and misunderstanding. You can set an example of
interfaith dialogue and cooperation."
</P>
<P>
"The member states of the United Nations have enshrined these
freedoms in several landmark documents, most notably the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
 He said, "Where governments and authorities fail to protect
these freedoms, it is at once an affront and a menace."
</P>
<P>
"There must be no room in the 21st century for religious
bigotry and intolerance," he said.
</P>
<P>
Admitting that "the practice of religion can have its back
side," Annan said, "Religious extremism has too often oppressed or
discriminated against women and minorities. Religion has often
been yoked to nationalism, stoking the flames of violent conflict
and setting group against group."
</P>
<P>
"Religious leaders have not always spoken out when their
voices could have helped combat hatred and persecution, or could
have roused people from indifference," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Religion is not itself to blame: as I have often said, the
problem is usually not with the faith, but with the faithful," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Ottawa Police Arrest 140 People in Anti-Prostitution Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Police have arrested 140 people
for prostitution-related offenses in the Canadian capital city of
Ottawa since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
Police expected Tuesday their intensifying action to bring the
total of arrests to 200 by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
In the latest three-day swing last week, police captured 58
people, including a 15-year-old boy and a 70-year-old man.
</P>
<P>
Six prostitutes were arrested and five were charged. Of the 52
clients, 24 were charged, police said.
</P>
<P>
Criminal charges ranged from communicating for the purpose of
prostitution to violation of Highway Traffic Act.
</P>
<P>
"The people who live there are sick and tired of bringing
their kids to the park and seeing used condoms and syringes all
over the place," said Scott FitzGerald, an Ottawa-Carleton police
officer.
</P>
<P>
The blitzes are making a noticeable dent in the trade, the
officer said, adding "I've noticed considerably less girls out on
the streets this year over last year."
</P>
<P>
"That is a positive sign," he said. Police are planning for
another major clean-up in the coming months, according to the
officer.

<HEADLINE> Prodi Welcomes Burundi Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Romano Prodi, president of the
European Commission, said here Tuesday the Peace and
Reconciliation Agreement signed Monday at Arusha of Tanzania is an
"important step" in the long and difficult peace process in
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
"On behalf of the European Commission, I welcome this important
step in the negotiations, the signing of the Burundi Peace and
Reconciliation Agreement," head of the European Union's executive
body said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to praise Mr. (Nelson) Mandela for his efforts
and commitment, as a facilitator, in achieving this result. Our
gratitude also goes to the other regional leaders and all the
other parties who have worked to reach where we are today. We
should also not forget the efforts of the former (Tanzanian)
president, Mwalimu Nyerere," he said.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said the EU from the beginning has supported the peace
process politically with major financial and logistical
contributions.
</P>
<P>
The commission believes that structural aid to Burundi should
resume gradually once certain conditions are met, he said.
</P>
<P>
The conditions are active engagement of all parties in the
peace negotiations and improvement in human rights and in security
situation, according to Prodi.
</P>
<P>
The commission is already preparing the resumption of aid,
starting with assessment of the health and rural economy sectors,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The EU will focus its support to Burundi on the implementation
of the peace agreement and it will look for a new model of
development for this central African country, based on an equal
sharing of benefits of progress among all Burundians, said Prodi.
</P>
<P>
The Monday peace deal was signed to end Burundi's seven-year-
old civil war, but five hard-line ethnic Tutsi parties boycotted
the agreement. Fourteen of the 19 delegations who have labored
through peace talks for more than two years agreed to the terms of
a document drafted by former South African president Mandela,
mediator for Burundian peace.
</P>
<P>
More than 200,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed
since 1993 in a wave of violence between the country's mainly
Tutsi army and Hutu rebels.

<HEADLINE> ICU Ordered to Pass Doping Information to Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Court in Lausanne has
ruled that the International Cycling Union (ICU) must provide the
Italian justice authorities with the names of 15 riders tested for
drugs during last year's Giro d'Italia.
</P>
<P>
In its ruling today, the Federal Court overturned an appeal by
the Lausanne-based cycling administrative body against handing
over the documents.
</P>
<P>
The ICU carried out the tests in June 1999 before the start of
the Pedrazzo to Madonna di Campiglio stage of the race. 13 of the
15 tests reportedly showed traces of the banned substance EPO.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Court rejected the ICU's argument that the Italian
authorities did not need the information for their own enquiry and
that providing it would constitute a breach of confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
The court ruled that the Italian investigators were entitled to
know the identity of the riders concerned. It said they were
investigating whether the suspects were involved in trafficking
the drug, and were not concerned with whether they had broken the
rules of the sport.
</P>
<P>
The ruling comes a day after the International Olympic
Committee(IOC), also based in Lausanne, approved a blood-urine
test for detecting EPO. The IOC plans to test competitors for the
performance-enhancing drug before the start of the Sydney Olympics
next month.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Qian Qichen Meets Taiwan Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen
met with a delegation of the People First Party from Taiwan,
headed by Liu Sung-fan, at Diaoyutai State Guesthouse today.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who is also a member of the Political Bureau of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, appreciated the
consensus reached by the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits (ARATS) and the People First Party on enhancing
cross-straits economic cooperation and promoting direct links in
mail, shipping and trade between the two sides of the Taiwan
Straits.
</P>
<P>
Qian stated that the "one China" principle is the prerequisite
and the basis for promoting cross-straits relations and peaceful
reunification of the motherland. So long as the two sides accept
the "one China" principle, can the two sides have a basis for
dialogue and cooperation. Anything can be negotiated on an equal
footing on this basis.
</P>
<P>
The state of one China is an objective reality rather than an
issue imposed on Taiwan. For a long time, both sides of the Taiwan
Straits had adhered to the "one China" principle. It turned out to
be a problem only when Lee Teng-hui became engaged in splittism
and the "Taiwan Independence" forces interfered, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
"We fully understand the misfortune suffered by Taiwan
compatriots over the past century and respect their desire for
being the master of their own house and their freedom to choose
their way of life. We are willing to listen to the opinions and
suggestions of Taiwan compatriots on developing cross-straits
relations and advancing the process of peaceful reunification," he
said.
</P>
<P>
People on both sides of the Taiwan Straits are Chinese. It is
the general trend of development and the common aspiration of the
people that the two sides must be reunified, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese mainland wishes to continue negotiations on the "
one China" principle on the suggestions raised by the People First
Party and expects the PFC and other parties and organizations in
Taiwan to make endeavors to improve the cross-straits relations on
the "one China" principle, Qian stressed.
</P>
<P>
The PFC held a meeting with the ARATS in Beijing today. They
reached a consensus on reopening dialogue between the ARATS and
Taiwan's Strait Exchange Foundation (SEF), promoting bilateral
trade, exchange of personnel and accelerating three direct links.

<HEADLINE> One-Yuan Compensation Case Involving Intellectual Property Right in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 29 (Xinhua) -- A court in China's largest city,
Shanghai, today ordered a local health product firm and a research
institute to stop actions of infringement upon the intellectual
property rights of the Shanghai Minsheng Traditional Chinese
Medicine Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
The court also asked the two accusers, Shanghai Dahan Glossy
Ganoderma Health Product Co. Ltd and Shanghai Jumao Medicine
Research Institute, to pay one yuan (0.12 US dollars) in
compensation to the defendant and apologize to the defendant.
</P>
<P>
This was the lowest compensation fee amount in cases involving
intellectual property right in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Minsheng Traditional Chinese Medicine Research
Institute alleged that the two accusers infringed upon its
intellectual property rights by making false advertisements on TV.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Dahan Glossy Ganoderma Health Product Co. Ltd began
producing glossy ganoderma health products by using technology and
glossy ganoderma developed by Minsheng in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In November 1997, the health product was authorized a health
food certificate by the Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Minsheng stopped cooperating with Dahan but agreed
that Dahan could still use its name in product packages free of
charge.
</P>
<P>
However, Minsheng found that the accusers used the name of
Shanghai Jumao Medicine Research Institute in advertisements for
the health product in local TV advertisements in February and
March of this year.
</P>
<P>
The accusers were also found to have published articles in
newspapers claiming that a breakthrough in glossy ganoderma
research has been made by Shanghai Jumao Medicine Research
Institute.
</P>
<P>
Minsheng believed that Dahan and Jumao medicine research
institute infringed upon its right and lodged a complaint against
the two.

<HEADLINE> Buddhist Ceremony Held in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Buddhists in Tibet
gathered at the Zhebung Monastery, one of the biggest in Tibet, to
watch the unveiling of a 40-meter-long silk portrait of Sakyamuni,
the founder of Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
People went to the monastery in throngs early this morning.
The ceremony began at 8 am. A number of lama musicians blew horns
and "Suona," a kind of traditional Chinese musical instrument,
while 33 lamas chanted Buddhist scriptures.
</P>
<P>
Five minutes later, the huge scrolled silk portrait bearing the
image of Sakyamuni, who clad in a red robe, was slowly unveiled.
All Buddhists knelt down to the ground to pray and presented Hada,
a piece of white silk as a token of respect, to the Buddhist image.
</P>
<P>
Chinese and foreign on-lookers were amazed at the grand
ceremony. An Australian woman named Catherine said, "I have never
seen such a magnificent religious activity before. Though we have
different religious beliefs, the Tibetan people are very friendly
to us. We've had big fun here."
</P>
<P>
Zhebung Monastery, Sheltered in the mountains in the western
suburbs of Lhasa, was built in 1416 during the reign of Yongle(
1403-1424) of the Ming Dynasty by the disciples of Zong Kaba,
founder of the Yellow Sect of Tibetan Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
The lamasery holds many Buddhist classics and cultural relics.
It became the residence of the Panchen Lama in 1650. The monastery
now has more than 600 lamas in residence.

<HEADLINE> Manila Hopeful MILF to Soften Stand in Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government negotiators
are hopeful that the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) will
soften its stand in the peace talks and return to the negotiating
table in one month's time.
</P>
<P>
Edgardo Batenga, chairman of the government peace negotiating
panel, said Tuesday he is hoping the MILF leadership would finally
realize that peace is the only solution to the conflict in
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
"That is our target. I hope the MILF leadership will realize
that the only solution to the Mindanao problem is through peaceful
negotiation," Batenga said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
He also said the government is hopeful that the MILF would
consider the government's proposed package of autonomy of Muslim
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the government offered the MILF a package of political
proposals centered on autonomy as an alternative to the cessation
the MILF originally sought.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada made it clear that he will
not allow anyone to carve out a part of the country's territory.
</P>
<P>
The president said there is only one country, one flag, one
constitution, and one Armed Forces of the Philippines, and he is
committed to defend these principles.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the MILF will perhaps consider autonomy as something
both parties can agree upon on the negotiating table," Batenga
said.
</P>
<P>
The 15,000-strong MILF is the Philippines' largest Muslim rebel
group which has been fighting for an independent state in Mindanao
for more than two decades.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Reiterates Commitment to Hostages' Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- With six more hostages released
by the Abu Sayyaf, the Philippine government reiterated Tuesday
its commitment to work out the safe release of the captives still
in the hands of the extremist group in Jolo, Sulu.
</P>
<P>
National Security Adviser Alexander Aguirre said "Peaceful
negotiations will continue. We believe the life of each hostage is
important. We want all of them released safely."
</P>
<P>
He noted that President Joseph Estrada has placed a premium on
the safety of the hostages since the crisis broke out late in
April when the rebel group abducted 21 hostages from Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The president repeatedly rejected suggestions to launch a
military attack on the Abu Sayyaf, and made it clear that he wants
all the hostages released safely.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre said the government would continue to provide chief
government negotiator Robert Aventajado with the needed support to
succeed in his task.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two days, the Abu Sayyaf released six more
hostages from other countries, leaving nearly 20 local and foreign
people in captivity.

<HEADLINE> Two Canadian Boats Sink in Lobster Fishing Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Two native boats sank Tuesday
morning in lobster fishing dispute near the Burnt Church reserve
in Canada's Atlantic province of New Brunswick, the country's CTV
Newsnet reported.
</P>
<P>
In the latest confrontation over fishing right, at least two
native boats were swamped and sunk with two fishermen arrested,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The incident followed Monday's failure to reach a fisheries
agreement between federal Indian Affairs Minister Robert Nault and
leaders of the Burnt Church band of Mi'kmaq Indians.
</P>
<P>
Nault stressed the balance of "the rule of law" and the
interests of Indian bands before abruptly leaving the short,
closed-door meeting, which was supposed to have been a gesture of
goodwill toward a permanent treaty.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 lobster traps have been seized and several
people arrested during the weeks of dispute. Last week one
fisheries officer was hit in the face by a rock.
</P>
<P>
The Burnt Church natives insist on their right to set traps all
the year round in confrontation with federal officers trying to
enforce conservation measures.
</P>
<P>
Citing a decision made last year by the Supreme Court of Canada
in the Donald Marshall case, the Burnt Church natives say they
have their treaty right to fish where and when they wish.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court of Canada ruled natives can earn a "moderate
livelihood" from their catch, but later said the treaty right is
subject to regulation by the federal government.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Residents Making Plans for New Life in East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Li Shimin, one of the more than
800 former Three Gorges villagers resettled in east China's
Jiangsu Province, is confident about his new life and has many
plans for it in Chetan Village, Dafeng, where he now lives.
</P>
<P>
Li told his new neighbors that he will buy a machine for his
wife to make noodles and a truck for himself to transport goods to
earn money for their family.
</P>
<P>
He also dreams of running a factory of his own when he has
enough money and he is confident that his dream will come true.
</P>
<P>
Li's family and over 800 other Three Gorges villagers left
their former homes in Yunyang County of Chongqing Municipality on
August 24 and arrived at their new homes in eight villages in
Dafeng on Monday (August 28).
</P>
<P>
Like other former Three Gorges residents who settled down in
the other 10 provinces of China, they left their former homes, 2,
000 kilometers away, to pave the way for the construction of the
gigantic Three Gorges dam project which is expected to be
completed around 2009.
</P>
<P>
They were happy to find that their new homes are well
facilitated with water, electricity and other household utensils
and daily life necessities. They were also warmly welcomed by the
local villagers.
</P>
<P>
The local government has allocated a certain area of farmland,
equal to that of local farmers to each of the new residents. Some
local villagers are entrusted to provide meals for the newcomers
for at least three days.
</P>
<P>
Li Chengrong, a 16-year-old girl, was enrolled into a local
normal school in Dafeng and she was also exempted 21,000 yuan (2,
530 U.S. dollars) in tuition fee.
</P>
<P>
Wu Wenquan, a former villager of Fengjie County of Chongqing
who resettled in Jiashan County of Zhejiang Province, used to be a
skillful grower of orange trees.
</P>
<P>
The local government has exempted him from paying the farming
taxes for three years. He plans to attend some training courses to
grasp more skills and he expects to be successful in farming and
in doing other businesses in future.
</P>
<P>
Pan Guangyao, also from Fengjie County, was deeply impressed
with the fast-growing economy and good education available in the
coastal area.
</P>
<P>
He said he was happy that his two children will have good
opportunities to study, and he will have more chances to do
business.
</P>
<P>
According to a related plan, a total of 70,000 rural people
will leave five counties in Chongqing to resettle in Shanghai and
10 provinces including Zhejiang, Shandong and Guangdong in three
years.
</P>
<P>
From 1993 to the end of 1999, 230,000 people have been
relocated to higher elevations in the Three Gorges area. A total
of 1.13 million people will be relocated by 2009.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Family Businesses in Asia Need Revamp to Compete in Global Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Globalization and e-commerce
will force Chinese family businesses (CFBs) in Asia to restructure
their traditional business models in order to survive in the new
economy, Anderson Consulting and the Economist Intelligence Unit (
EIU) said in a report published here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled "Beyond the Bamboo Network," says the
traditional strength of CFBs -- the role of the middleman and the
reliance on "who you know" -- will matter less as these
organizations will be tested against their ability to build
markets and acquire new customers.
</P>
<P>
As the first true regional assessment of the outlook of this
significant segment of Asia's economy, the report comes on the eve
of China's potential entry to the WTO and examines a vital sector
of business.
</P>
<P>
CFBs control an extremely large percentage of Asia's economic
wealth in proportion to their share of the region's overall
population. In Indonesia, for example, the Chinese, who constitute
only 3-4 percent of the population, control 70 percent of the
country's economy.
</P>
<P>
"Many of the CFBs operating in this region represent some of
the most aggressive and agile businesses that have managed to
thrive over the last decade," said Joseph Lobbato, a partner with
Anderson Consulting's Organization and Human Performance practice
in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"However, the Asian financial crisis has rocked the foundation
on which these organizations were built and many are soon
realizing that familiar marketplaces are becoming increasingly
complex.
</P>
<P>
"Through our research, we have come across examples of CFBs who
are already embarking on this transformation. These organizations
are aware that they are going to have to embrace change and new
thinking if they are to survive for the next five years," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Overall, CFBs in Asia will need to discard rigid, traditional
ways and learn to live with the idea of developing more flexible
and agile organizations in order to cope with the challenges
brought about by the new economy," Lobbato added.
</P>
<P>
With e-commerce rapidly emerging as a potent driving force in
the global business landscape, CFBs will be revolutionized to a
degree never before.
</P>
<P>
Ken Davis, chief economist and bureau chief of EIU Asia, said
CFBs risk losing business to competitors who will be better able
to attract staff and financing and who, therefore, will be better
attuned to the needs of the market.
</P>
<P>
"Nonetheless, during the research phase of this study, we were
encouraged to meet leaders of several CFBs throughout the region
that are identifying weaknesses within their own organizations and
making serious efforts to bring about change," he added.
</P>
<P>
The report refers to numerous prominent CFBs, their senior
executives and management teams including Li Ka-shing's Cheung
Kong/ Hutchison/ Orange empire and Cheng Yu-tung's New World Group.
</P>
<P>
The report comments that one has to assimilate so much more
knowledge nowadays to conduct business, either IT or general
market knowledge.
</P>
<P>
"Overall, the outlook is bright for CFBs across Asia. The first
step is to recognize areas that will need to be transformed,"
concluded Lobbato.
</P>
<P>
"Even with the best business models in place, an organization
without the right corporate culture and leadership talent will not
be able to deal with the competitive pressures. Once this is
accomplished, CFBs can move full speed ahead with aggressive
change programs aimed at increasing their competitive advantage,"
he noted.

Leung Chiu-wai has been invited to star in a new announcement in
the public interest in Hong Kong, which will go on air on Tuesday

</P>
<P>
The new announcement is developed upon the concept of the
campaign's previous ones, "equip yourself with better English and
grasp your opportunity for better prospects".
</P>
<P>
"I'm delighted to be involved in the campaign and to be able to
share my experience in learning English with the people of Hong
Kong," Leung said.
</P>
<P>
The campaign is a year-long initiative of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region government to heighten public awareness of
the importance of workplace English.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Why Price Cuts Bring No More Car Buyers in China? (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Those who want a car are still
waiting although price wars have already reduced car prices in the
Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Domestic cars experienced the largest-ever fall in price
recently, with the prices for the Santana, Jetta and Fukang
dropped 5,000 yuan (602.4 US dollars) to 13,000 yuan (1,566.3
dollars) and the price war is still going on.
</P>
<P>
However, consumers remain calm, except for a slight increase in
the sales of Fukang cars, the transaction volume of other cars did
not increase in the Yayuncun car market, Beijing's largest, and
the same situation was reported in many other cities.
</P>
<P>
Jia Xinguang, an expert with the Automobile Development
Research Institute of the State Administration of Machinery
Industry, blamed the price war on the fact that small-scale car
enterprises expect to capture the market, and some companies are
eager to sell out older car models in the process of producing new
cars.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the price of Chinese cars will not decrease
too much, citing that the Chinese car enterprises cannot lower the
costs through mass production. Now, no enterprise in China
actually manufactures more than 20,000 cars annually.

<TEXT>
<P>
Most Chinese still cannot afford a car, but many expect to buy
a car after the country's entry into the World Trade Organization
(WTO). China will cut its tariffs on automobile imports from the
current 80 to 100 percent level to 25 percent by the middle of
2006.
</P>
<P>
International auto exhibitions have provided opportunities for
Chinese consumers to check out attractive car models. Some
consumers are waiting for new and beautiful cars to hit the market
so they can purchase them.
</P>
<P>
The environment for using cars should be upgraded in China,
said Zhang Xingye, director of the China Automobile Engineering
Association.
</P>
<P>
The enthusiasm of car buyers will be affected if there is no
help available when a car breaks down or it takes a whole week to
make a minor repair on a car, or extra charges are collected on
highways, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Feng Fei from the Industrial Economy Research Department of the
State Development Research Center urged the central government to
loosen the restrictions on car models, prices and oil in a move to
stimulate domestic demand and open a wider market for car
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He said that the effort is also in response to the challenges
for the automobile industry brought by the country's pending
accession to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
China produces about 1.6 million automobiles annually. In the
past 20 years, the country put restrictions on car consumption.
However, more and more Chinese will buy cars as the economy grows
faster.

<HEADLINE> Abu Sayyaf's Abduction of American National Confirmed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine authorities
confirmed Tuesday that the extremist Abu Sayyaf kidnapped an
American national in the southern Philippines on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Robert Aventajado, Philippine government's chief negotiator for
the release of hostages taken by the Abu Sayyaf, confirmed through
the local ABS-CBN television that the group abducted an American
in Zamboanga City on Monday and brought him to Sulu province.
</P>
<P>
"My people on the ground have confirmed the presence of one
Jeffrey Schilling, an American, in the camp of Abu Sayyaf,"
Aventajado said."He was taken there yesterday (Monday) afternoon
together with a woman who was supposed to be his guide."
</P>
<P>
A splinter group of the Abu Sayyaf claimed that it had
kidnapped American Jeffrey Craig Edwards Schilling and would kill
him unless its demands were met.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear yet what are the demands of the rebel group.
Officials said the rebels would likely be seeking a ransom and the
release of Muslim militants held in the United States in
connection with the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in New
York.
</P>
<P>
The rebels also released a passport number they said belonged
to Schilling and claimed the man was an agent of the U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials confirmed a U.S. citizen by that name and with
that passport number had been in the Philippines. A group of
officials from the U.S. Embassy to the Philippines has flown to
Zamboanga City to deal with the matter.
</P>
<P>
The kidnapping came as six Western hostages released by the
rebels arrived in Tripoli, Libya, and were expected to meet with
Libya leader Moammar Gadhafi.
</P>
<P>
Libya reportedly paid one million dollars ransom each for the
hostages' release.
</P>
<P>
The rebel group is still holding the remaining five of the
original group of 21 hostages kidnapped from Malaysia's resort
island of Sipadan on April 23, and two French journalists seized
in Jolo last month.

government commission meeting on the elimination of the
consequences of the tower fire.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the tower director, Vyacheslav Misyulin, said the
television transmitters fixed below the height of 19.5 meters
above the ground remain intact as the fire did not touch there.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Itar-Tass Monday, Misyulin said
the first results of the examination of the tower indicate that
equipment located 32 meters above the ground has not been damaged
and can work. Control rooms located from 117 to 147 meters high
are also intact.
</P>
<P>
At the position from 243 to 248 meters high, where radio relay
equipment and the mobile television station PTS is located,
equipment is covered with a thick layer of soot but an initial
examination shows that it has not been damaged.
</P>
<P>
President Vladimir Putin has ordered Communications Minister
Leonid Reiman and Mass Media Minister Mikhail Lesin to take all
measures to restore television broadcasts to Moscow and the larger
Moscow region within a week.
</P>
<P>
The ministers have pledged to resume the broadcasting of main
Russian television channels to Moscow and the Moscow region by
this weekend, using high-frequency channels, cable networks and
other means.
</P>
<P>
Concrete technical ways of doing this will be determined after
the tower is examined by specialists Tuesday, Lesin said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, the third body of the four people believed to
have died during the fire has been found in an elevator dropping
into the tower's basement, reported the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
The third victim has been identified as Alexander Shepitsyn, a
plumber of the tower, said the press service of the Emergencies
Ministry.

follow.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Organizers Undergo Minor Housekeeping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- An management reshuffle was
made Tuesday as chief executive of the Sydney Organising committee
Sandy Hollway was demoted to ceremonial duties.
</P>
<P>
David Richmond, head of the Olympic Coordination Authority (OCA)
, became the virtual replacement of Hollway as he was promoted to
director general of the organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
Hollway, who retains what becomes effectively an honorary
position as CEO, has come under fire when a ticket budgeting
miscalculation led to a massive revenue shortfall in February .
</P>
<P>
The OCA, a government-run body in charge of the construction
and maintenance of Olympic venues, was merged earlier this year
with the organizing committee, which deals with the organization
and sport.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Michael Knight, New South Wales State's
Olympics Minister, said Richmond's appointment was part of the
operational integration between the two bodies.
</P>
<P>
"It's only about the paperwork catching up with reality of the
last six months," he said.  "It's minor housekeeping."

<HEADLINE> Iranian Radicals Attack Governor-General Amid Unrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 29 (Xinhua) -- A group of Iranian conservative
radicals on Tuesday beat Norollah Abedi, governor-general of the
Western Lorestan province, following a three-day unrest in the
provincial capital of Khorramabad.
</P>
<P>
Abedi was injured by assailants in a funeral procession for a
policeman who was killed on Sunday in a mass unrest in the city,
the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The assailants, who are against the reformist student group
Office to Foster Unity (OFU), also chanted slogans against
reformist Interior Minister Abdulvahed Musavi Lari, Deputy Interior
Minister for Political Affairs Mohsen Tajzadeh and the OFU.
</P>
<P>
Khorramabad has been the scene of violent demonstrations since
Saturday when two leading intellectuals invited to address an OFU
meeting were prevented from entering the city.
</P>
<P>
After the abortion of the meeting, violent confrontations
between reformist and conservative groups led to the death of a
police officer and injuries to scores of others on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
The unrest continued on Monday night as radicals smashed out
windows of government offices and unleash insults.
</P>
<P>
The assailants were finally dispersed by the security forces,
but it is not clear whether anyone was injured or arrested in the
overnight unrest.
</P>
<P>
The assailants on Monday also attacked a bus carrying students
in support of the OFU with bricks and stones. A number of students
were wounded in the attack when the bus was heading back to Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Many reformist parties, groups and lawmakers have condemned the
attacks on the OFU meeting and the unrest, some groups believed the
attacks were well-organized with strong background.
</P>
<P>
Iran's reformist and conservative camps have lined up against
each other after the powerful conservatives suffered a face-losing
defeat in the February parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives, who still control most of the important state
organs, including judiciary, the armed forces and state-run radio
and televisions, have stepped up their efforts to crack down the
reformist campaign.
</P>
<P>
So far more than 20 pro-reform papers and journals have been
banned from publishing and a number of reformist figures have been
imprisoned on charges of violating Islamic principles and
advocating American-style reforms.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, conservative radicals, particularly those of
the Ansar-e Hezbollah (Friends of God Party), frequently launched
violent attacks on pro-reform allies and beat students and people
attending the reformist rallies.

<HEADLINE> Israel Reacts to Jerusalem Conference in Morocco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior Israeli political
source Tuesday made Israel's first reaction to Monday's Islamic
summit on the Jerusalem issue, saying that the meeting gave only
lip-service support for the Palestinians' stands.
</P>
<P>
Quoted by Israel Radio, the anonymous source said that the
meeting of the Jerusalem Committee of the Organization of the
Islamic Conference in Morocco only "places the ball squarely back
to the court of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat."
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from 16 member countries of the committee,
which is designed to protect the Arab and Muslim character of
Jerusalem, concluded at the end of the meeting that it should be
the Palestinians themselves who will decide whether or not to make
compromise on the issue, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Significant differences over the Jerusalem issue, which had been
the major stumbling block for reaching an Israeli-Palestinian peace
agreement, led to the failure of last month's Camp David summit,
attended by Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and United
States President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Israel claimed the holy city as its "undivided and eternal
capital," while the Palestinians want East Jerusalem, which was
occupied by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war, as the capital of their
future state.
</P>
<P>
Since the botched Camp David talks, Arafat had been busy with
marathon diplomatic efforts to explicate his positions on the issue
to world leaders.
</P>
<P>
The conference of the Jerusalem Committee, which is chaired by
Moroccan King Mohammed VI, was part of Arafat's efforts to
formulate unified Arab stands on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
However, after the United States warned against any statements
which could "complicate the peace talks," the meeting only ended
with a statement calling for world recognition of a Palestinian
state with Jerusalem as its capital, stopping short of adopting a
unified position on Jerusalem, according to Israeli media reports.
</P>
<P>
"We will defend the return of Al-Qods (Jerusalem) to its
legitimate owners, and there will be no peace and no stability in
the Middle East region if it does not return to its legitimate
owners. This is the red line which can't be crossed," the
conference's statement said.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Wins in First Round of Lebanese Parliamentary Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The opposition's sweeping victory
in the first stage of Lebanon's general elections has been
officially confirmed by the final figures announced by Interior
Minister Michel Murr Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Only 22 of the 63 newly elected legislators were supporters of
President Emile Lahoud's regime, while 41 were outright supporters
or sympathizers of billionaire ex-Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, As
Safir newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The Ad Diyar newspaper spoke of a looming power crisis if the
majority of the new parliament came out in support of Hariri's
return to the premiership instead of Prime Minister Salim Hoss,
Lahoud's favorite.
</P>
<P>
"President Lahoud's unwillingness to coexist with ex-Premier
Hariri in power is the problem that may dampen the post-elections
era," said Ad Diyar.
</P>
<P>
"The president is constitutionally obligated to sign a decree
designating Hariri as the new prime minister if a parliamentary
majority lined up behind the ex-premier's nomination. But there is
nothing in the constitution that would bind the president to sign
the decree of the government makeup if he disapproves of certain
chosen cabinet ministers," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Local media said that Hariri's alliance with Druze overlord
Walid Jumblat was the main winning factor in last Sunday's first
election round. The alliance grabbed 15 of the 18 seats allotted
for the Chouf and Aley-Baabda provinces, east and southeast of
Beirut, and four strong sympathizers in the Christian heartland
northeast of the capital.
</P>
<P>
There is a media consensus that the Beirut battle next Sunday is
the focal point of the second and last round of the nation's third
parliamentary elections after the 1975-1990 civil war.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Al Mustaqbal newspaper said that the United States
State Department had expressed its satisfaction over the first
round of the Lebanese elections.
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to working with the new Lebanese parliament on
an agenda of common interests to accomplish a comprehensive peace
in the Middle East and we expect that constitutional rules will be
observed in forming the new Lebanese government," the paper quoted
an unnamed State Department official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese parliamentary elections kicked off last Sunday in parts
of the country. Voters in Beirut and south Lebanon will cast their
ballots next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Israel withdrew from south Lebanon on May 24, ending a 22-year
occupation there, but sporadic clashes between Israeli soldiers and
Lebanese civilians were reported on the U.N.-drawn border.

<HEADLINE> Iran Launches Submarine in Persian Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Tuesday launched a
submarine in the Persian Gulf port city of Bandar Abbas, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The light submarine, called "Al-Sabehat" (ships), was launched
in the presence of Defense Minister Rear Admiral Ali Shamkhani.
</P>
<P>
Shamkhani told reporters that it is the first Iranian-made
submarine, which has sophisticated navigational equipment and has
been designed to function under various climatic conditions of the
Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The manufacture of the submarine indicates that Iran's defense
industries have reached a point of progress to meet the needs of
the armed forces, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
According to Mehdi Sharifi Zamani, manager of the project, the
submarine can easily carry out various operations such as
reconnaissance, transfer of troops and planting mines. It can
accommodate two divers inside and three more outside.
</P>
<P>
He said the submarine was made by the Defense Technology
University affiliated to the Defense Ministry. The project has
saved the country 1 million U.S. dollar, he added.
</P>
<P>
Iran's navy bought three Kilo submarines from Russia from 1992
to 1996, with a total cost of about 345 million dollars. But it is
not clear whether the submarine launched Tuesday was a refitted
model of the Kilo submarines.

<P>
MOSCOW, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Two Russian civilian vessels have
got into distress while traveling in two different Russian seas,
the Itar-Tass news agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A Russian trawler ran aground in the Karaginsky Bay of the

"Poor countries can not compete, but we can share. Let's share.
This is the philosophy of Malaysia," he said.

He said the stress on globalization now is a free movement of

Earlier in his address at the conference, Mahathir asked
bankers to become more proactive in discharging their

He said Malaysia needs entrepreneurial bankers who are not
merely money lenders and there should be bankers who are experts
in managing risks and not afraid to take calculated risks.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Tea Production Drops in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's black tea production
dropped by 20.943 million kilograms in July, from 27.769 million
kilograms in the previous month, the Sri Lanka Tea Board said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tea output of the island nation on the Indian Ocean, well-known
in the world as one of the main tea producers, was also lower
compared with the 22.495 million kilograms in the same period of
last year, the board said.
</P>
<P>
Excessive rains and gusty winds in the growing regions of the
western part of the island affected the output of high- and medium-
grown teas in the country, brokers said.
</P>
<P>
But tea production in the first seven months of this year was
up 10 percent at 181.282 million kilograms compared with 164.504
million kilograms in 1999, the board said.
</P>
<P>
Tea production of Sri Lanka reached a record high of 283.76
million kilograms in 1999 compared with a previous high of 280.06
million one year earlier.

PARIS, August 29 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine Tuesday thanked the Philippine and Libyan governments for
arranging the release of six foreign hostages on Sunday by the
Muslim rebel group Abu Sayyaf in southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"We thank the Filipinos, as well as the Libyans, for what they
have done for this release but, I repeat, we also want the release
of the remaining hostages," said Vedrine on radio Europe 1.
</P>
<P>
He also said that France refuses to pay any ransom to hostage
takers, because that will encourage them to kidnap more people who
are traveling around the world, sometimes in risky areas.
</P>
<P>
Six foreign hostages, including three French nationals, were
released on Sunday by Abu Sayyaf, but three other foreign hostages,
including two other French nationals, are still held by the rebel
group.

<HEADLINE> Russia Confirms Postponement of DPRK FM Visit to Moscow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The scheduled visit by the DPRK foreign minister to Moscow will
be in the end of September.
</P>
<P>
Initially, Paek Nam Sun was expected to fly to Moscow from New
York after the end of the United Nations General Assembly session
and discuss the time and agenda of the Russian-DPRK summit with
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
However, Russian Foreign Ministry sources did not rule out the
possibility that Paek may make a stopover in Moscow on his way
home from New York.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, Paek Nam-sun and Ivanov may meet at
the UN session in New York, after their previous meeting at the
end of July during the ASEAN forum in Bangkok, capital of Thailand,
where the two sides agreed that DPRK top leader Kim Jong Il will
visit Russia.
</P>
<P>
The sources, cited by Interfax, disclosed that in autumn,
Pyongyang should host a session of the Russian-DPRK
intergovernmental commission for trade and economic cooperation.
The two countries are also planning defense and parliamentary
contacts.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency quoted "a high-ranking official" of
the Russian Foreign Ministry as saying that the postponement of
Paek's visit doesn't mean a decline in the relations between the
two nations.
</P>
<P>
The rescheduling "is in no way connected with the media
reports on some contradictions allegedly emerging in the relations
between Russia and North Korea (DPRK) and does not mean that
Russian-North Korean cooperation is declining," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The postponement of the visit is likely to be connected with
changes in the schedule of bilateral contacts, including those on
the highest level," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The parties concerned will continue their preparations for
DPRK leader Kim Jong Il's visit to Moscow planned for early 2001.
</P>
<P>
The level of relations between Russia and DPRK is still high,
and the recent Pyongyang trip of Russian President Vladimir Putin
contributed a lot to their development, the official said.

PARIS, August 29 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine will visit Russia at the end of September to prepare for
the visit to France by Russian President Vladimir Putin in October,
said Vedrine on Tuesday in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
Putin is due to come to Paris on October 30 to attend a regular
summit between Russia and the European Union (EU), of which France
is the current rotating presidency state.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president is also expected to hold talks with
French leaders on bilateral relations, apart from the overall
relations between Russia and the EU.
</P>
<P>
Relations between France and Russia were strained after France
criticized Moscow's military campaign against Chechen terrorists
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
But Putin and French President Jacques Chirac agreed to improve
relations when they met at the Group of Eight summit in Okinawa,
Japan, in July.

<HEADLINE> Jospin Regrets Interior Minister's Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 29 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin Tuesday regretted Interior Minister Jean-Pierre
Chevenement's decision to resign from his government because of
their dispute over Corsica.
</P>
<P>
In a communique formally announcing Chevenement's resignation,
Jospin said he accepted with regret the resignation and praised
the interior minister for his work during the three years of
service in the government.
</P>
<P>
He said he will propose his nomination of a new interior
minister to President Jacques Chirac but he did not mention whom
he will nominate.
</P>
<P>
The local press said Chevenement's resignation will much weaken
Jospin and have a strong impact on the left-wing coalition in
France, which consists of the Socialist Party, the Greens, the
Communist Party and the Citizens' Movement party led by
Chevenement.
</P>
<P>
Chevenement has openly criticized Jospin's plan to give Corsica
limited administrative and fiscal autonomy to appease the
nationalist militants on the island, who have been resorting to
violence for 25 years to seek greater autonomy from the central
government.
</P>
<P>
Jospin's plan, which will be implemented by 2004, could lead to
a break-up of the French Republic, according to Chevenement.

<HEADLINE> SKorean Delegation Leaves for Pyongyang for Ministerial Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 29 (Xinhua) -- A South Korean delegation Tuesday
left here for Pyongyang for the second round of inter-Korean
ministerial talks to further reconciliation and implement the
historic June 15 South-North Joint Declaration.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean delegation led by Unification Minister Park
Jae-kyu flew directly to Pyongyang Tuesday morning and is
reportedly to hold the first round of talks with the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) delegation headed by Chon Kum-
jin, a senior DPRK cabinet counselor.
</P>
<P>
Inter-Korean tension reduction and economic cooperation will
top the agenda of the three-day ministerial talks.
</P>
<P>
The three-day talks are expected to focus on establishing a
military hot line, inter-Korean defense ministerial meetings,
signing agreements on investment guarantees, dispute settlement,
the avoidance of double taxation and settlement of trade disputes.
</P>
<P>
Discussions for reconnecting the Seoul-Shinuiju railway line
will be also held at the second round of talks as the ground-
breaking ceremony in South Korea is set for next month.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate reunions of separated families, the South Korean
delegation will propose the establishment of a permanent meeting
place for the families separated since the 1950-53 Korean War.
</P>
<P>
The second round of ministerial talks will become a stepping
stone for full-fledged inter-Korean dialogue, said the official.
</P>
<P>
In their first talks in Seoul last month, the two sides agreed
on connecting a railway and the reunions of 100 separated families.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for Pyongyang, the unification minister said "We
will try hard to seal many agreements, but we cannot predict the
outcome."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- On Tuesday, affected by four
funds' interim reports released today, China's securities
investment fund market began to perform actively.
</P>
<P>
Tow thirds of the 30 funds increased, while two restructured
funds, Fund Handing and Fund Jinyuan, declined. The top gainer was
Fund Yulong, up 2.5 percent. Fund Hansheng and Hanxing were also
on the rising list. Most of the 22 discounted funds performed well,
and their turnover was expanded, according to Homeway, China's
leading on-line financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
Today, four interim reports were released by Fund Hanxing,
Hansheng, Yulong, and Yuhua. Investors paid their attention on
funds' earnings. Fund Yulong's NAV rose 43.4 percent in the first
half of this year, and its earnings per unit were 0.2922 yuan per
fund unit. Fund Hansheng's NAV rose 27.2 percent and its net
earnings were 0.2715 per unit. Fund Hanxing and Yuhua's NAVs
increased 27.18 percent and 1.14 percent respectively in the first
half of this year, and their earnings per unit were 0.1221 yuan
and 0.0747 per fund unit, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that today's market performance was mainly due
to fund managers' views on the market in the second half of this
year in their interim reports, which influenced investors'
sentiments.
</P>
<P>
Fund managers of Fund Hanxing and Hansheng expressed that they
hold an optimistic attitude towards the market in the second half
of this year.

BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The shenzhen B-share Index
rebounded 2.69 points, or 2.17 percent, to its intraday high of
126.64 points on Tuesday, after it fell for five straight days in
a row.
</P>
<P>
Turnover stood at 96.67 million HK dollars, which was 2.83
million HK dollars or 2.84 percent less than Monday's total,
according to Homeway, China's leading on-line financial and
securities company.
</P>
<P>
While a technical consolidation was finally seen in the main
part of the market, there did seem to be a much better tone in the
market itself. A large number of leadership, resulted from
increased buying activity, could be seen as evidence that investor
sentiment was gradually being restored.
</P>
<P>
Gainers outperformed losers by 45 to eight, with three
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Homeway analysts predict that as the positive signs are in the
ascendant, the market will resume its strength and pull itself out
of the doldrums.

<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Zeng Qinghong, an alternate
member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC), met today with Japanese Foreign
Minister Yohei Kono.
</P>
<P>
Zeng, also a member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central
Committee and head of the Organization Department of CPC Central
Committee, said the CPC and the Chinese government have worked for
the growth of Sino-Japanese relations. China and Japan, as close
neighbors, should increase exchanges, especially between young
statesmen of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes that the two countries will honor the
principles of the three Sino-Japanese political documents, and
solve problems on the basis of seeking common ground and pushing
aside difference, so as to further promote the development of
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Kono said the Japanese government and a vast majority of the
Japanese people have stood for developing Sino-Japanese friendly
relations since the normalization of their relations in 1972,
adding that the Japanese people have been inspired by remarks made
by Chinese President Jiang Zemin in a meeting with a large
Japanese delegation in May this year.
</P>
<P>
He said although there are some problems in bilateral relations,
the two countries could properly solve such problems through
dialog and consultation. Japan and China should promote mutual
understanding and trust.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, Clinton Meet in Quest for Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
met on Tuesday with U.S. President Bill Clinton to discuss ways of
helping the Palestinians and Israelis narrow gaps in their peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
"We are meeting for consultations to help the two parties to
reach a framework. That is very important before September, and we
hope we can achieve that," said Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians have set September 13 as the
deadline for a permanent peace deal to end their decades-old
conflicts, but their stands over Jerusalem, borders, refugees,
settlements and security, are far apart for now.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., the heaveweight mediator in the Mideast peace drive,
has last month hosted a summit between Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak to try to squeeze an
agreement over the final status issues for a comprehensive peace in
September.  But the big gap between Israel and the Palestinians
over Jerusalem, which both sides claim as their capital, aborted
the summit.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the leading role in the Arab world, has since stepped up
diplomatic contacts with parties concerned and produced ideas to
try to solve the most explosive and emotive issues facing the
negotiations. But the details of the ideas were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, for his part, said "the time is short to resolve the
thorny issues" in the Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations and "
we are working together to try to seek ways to help the parties get
over the big hump."
</P>
<P>
Clinton has left Cairo after the brief meeting at Cairo
International Airport's presidential lounge. He flew in from
Tanzania at the end of his three-day African tour, which had also
taken him to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents made no comments after the meeting. But
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters that the
session was "good, positive and important."
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that Clinton did not put forward new proposals, but
there have been ways and ideas that could bring the Palestinians
and Israelis closer together in their negotiations. But he
stressed "Of course, this needs great efforts."
</P>
<P>
United States Mideast envoy Dennis Ross said after the meeting
that the two leaders exchanged views on the intensive contacts and
consultations held by all parties to the Mideast peace process
following the Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
It is possible to reach a peace agreement, but the key is to
find ways to "translate the possibility into reality," Ross said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Receives More Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia received higher
investments in the first seven months this year with the amount
exceeding the capital investments value approved for the whole of
last year.
</P>
<P>
The country received applications for investments worth 15
billion ringgit (3.94 billion U.S. dollars) for the January to
July period Deputy International Trade and Industry Minister Kerk
Choo Ting said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
While the flow of foreign direct investments was maintained in
the first seven months, local investments came up strongly, he
told reporters after attending a strategic alliance agreement
signing ceremony between CS Metal Group and Leap Venture (M) Sdn
Bhd here.
</P>
<P>
Half of the applications for investments came from local
investors and this is a strong indication that Malaysia had fully
recovered from its financial and economic crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
This showed that Malaysia has always had a healthy and
encouraging investment climate, he added.
</P>
<P>
The investments were quite well split within the electronic and
electrical industry and the petrochemical industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said approved investments in the electronic and electrical
industry were almost three times more than 1998.
</P>
<P>
Investments in expansion/diversification projects amounted to 6.
4 billion ringgit (1.68 billion dollars), of which 86.6 percent
were attributed to foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
The electronic and electrical industry showed positive growth
in 1999 with a production index growth of 16.2 percent and the
industry remained the single largest contributor to Malaysia's
export earnings of 185 billion ringgit (48.68 billion dollars)
last year.

<HEADLINE> Manila Stocks End Higher on Hostage's Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Share prices in the Philippine
Stock Exchange closed higher Tuesday, boosted by the release of
another hostage held by a rebel group in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The 30-company Phisix, the market's major index, rose 9.05
points to close at 1,514.25. The broader all-shares index also
added 6.31 points to 680.2.
</P>
<P>
Dealers exchanged 879 million shares worth some 30 million U.S.
dollars on Tuesday against Monday's 412 million shares worth 20
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the release on Monday of another foreign hostage
held for four months by the Abu Sayyaf group in Mindanao lifted
market sentiment.
</P>
<P>
The group freed South African Carel Strydom, who joined five
other hostages released over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The higher-than-expected growth in the country's gross domestic
product (GDP) also helped push the index higher.
</P>
<P>
The National Statistics Office (NSO) reported Tuesday that the
country's GDP grew by 4.5 percent in the April-June period while
gross national product (GNP) expanded by 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The NSO said the growth in the GDP and GNP is attributed to
increased production in the agricultural and services sectors.
</P>
<P>
However, some analysts expressed doubts about whether the
market could sustain the gains in the previous sessions.
</P>
<P>
"We're still recovering. We still have to look for confirmation
of the recovery. The recent GDP figures are encouraging, but there
are some indications that investors overseas are using the rally
to get out from the market," said Gus Cosio, an analyst at PNB
Securities.

<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- China's T-bond trade slackened
today as the domestic stock market continued to climb high. Of the
six current treasuries, two tumbled, two advanced a little and two
closed unchanged. Transaction value totaled 1.45 billion yuan, 445
million yuan less than yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Bond 009704 plunged by 0.21 percent to 145.85 yuan, below its
five-day average price of 145.94 yuan, but still above the ten-day
and 20-day averages. Accordingly, its yield picked up 0.04
percentage points to 3.80 percent,according to Homeway, China's
leading on-line financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
The new floating-rate 010004, whose coupon rate is 2.87 percent

With the positive bias intact for the day, the market managed

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- It is still a long way to go for
China to achieve a simultaneous development of the well-being of
the disabled people and the whole society, said Deng Pufang,
chairman of the China Disabled Persons Federation, here today.
</P>
<P>
Deng made the remarks at a news conference held by the State
Council Information Office regarding the forthcoming tour by the
China Disabled People's Performing Arts Troupes from September 6-
27.
</P>
<P>
The troupe headed by Deng will stage a large music dance
performance titled "My Dream" in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the handicapped people in China, Deng said the
disabled persons need to readjust themselves to make development
and success in the market competition.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he urged the society to help the handicapped group
to get over difficulties as their living standards is lower than
the country's average.
</P>
<P>
China has 60 million disabled persons, 5 percent of its total
population and 18 percent of Chinese families have handicapped
members.
</P>
<P>
With the assistance of the government, over 6 million disabled
people have recovered at a certain degree. In 1999, 76 percent of
handicapped children studied in school, compared with less than 6
percent in 1987.
</P>
<P>
More than 2.5 million of the disabled were taught professional
skills and over 1.5 million of them have been employed by units in
accordance to law.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, over 1 million handicapped people opened their own
businesses with the help of the government. In 1999, 80 percent of
disabled people were employed, compared with 49 percent in 1987.
</P>
<P>
The government has allocated special funds to assist the
handicapped persons who are living under the poverty line. So far,
more than 9 million poor disabled people in rural areas have
bidden farewell to poverty through labor.
</P>
<P>
Over 3,000 cultural facilities have been opened for the
handicapped in particular, according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
To prevent mentally retardedness, over 90 million Chinese women
and children living in iodine-insufficient areas have taken iodic
pills.

MACAO, August 29 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of judges of the
Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) left here Monday for a
four-day visit to neighboring Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
"The trip is aimed at increasing channels of contact and laying
the foundation for future judicial cooperation," said Sam Hou Fai,
head of the delegation and president of the Court of Final Appeal
of the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will visit courts in Guangzhou and nearby cities.
Judges of Macao and Guangdong will brief each other on their
respective judicial systems, discuss ways to strengthen personnel
training and seek judicial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Because of the difference in judicial systems and the lack of
judicial agreements, the court rulings made at one place sometimes
are difficult to be carried out by the judicial organs of the
other place, Hou Fai said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the trip is made for Macao and Guangdong to
maintain close relations and that the Macao SAR will seek more
judicial cooperation with other parts of the inland areas of China
in the future.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Says Efforts Underway for Palestinian-Israeli Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
said on Tuesday that all parties are now trying their best to help
the Palestinians and Israel find a final solution to their decades-
old conflict.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to do our best to find a solution, we are meeting
for consultations to help the two parties to reach a framework,"
Mubarak said before sitting down for talks with United States
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrived in Cairo Tuesday morning for a brief visit at
the end of his three-day African tour, which had also taken him to
Nigeria and Tanzania
</P>
<P>
"That is very important before September, and we hope we can
achieve that," added Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, a major mediator in the Mideast and believed having
great influence over the Palestinian side, has been contacting with
all parties to try to bring the Palestinians and Israel together.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat frequently visits Cairo for
consultation with Mubarak over positions in the talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel have set September 13 as the
deadline for a permanent peace deal, but the stands of two sides
over some key final-status issues are far apart for now.
</P>
<P>
The most sticking point in the talks is the status of Jerusalem,
which both Israel and the Palestinians claim as their capital.
</P>
<P>
"The time is short to resolve the thorny issues" in the peace
talks between the Palestinians and Israel, said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"I think all the parties understand this. So we are working
together to try to seek ways to help the parties get over the big
hump," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has left Cairo after the brief meeting at Cairo
International Airport's presidential lounge.

<HEADLINE> Bio-engineered Trees Could Help Green the Desert: Israeli Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 29 (Xinhua) -- A series of bio-engineered
trees, which could withstand extreme difficult existing conditions,
will help green the desert, a press release by Israel's Hebrew
University said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Professor Arie Altman, head of the Institute of Plant Sciences
and Genetics in Agriculture at the university, said his research
group had successfully isolated unique gene proteins within the
poplar tree, which can preserve the activities of cells of the tree
in dry and saline conditions.
</P>
<P>
Scientists could, thus, stimulate higher production of these
proteins in the tree seedlings and enhance the trees' capabilities
to withstand severe conditions, Altman said.
</P>
<P>
So a series of trees that could bear barren conditions is within
reach, the press release added.
</P>
<P>
The research had particular significance as in recent years
scientists have published a series of dire forecast of steadily
increasing desertification of the earth's surface.
</P>
<P>
In one of those predicts, some 40 to 50 percent of the earth's
surface will be dry and saline as a result of global warming and
increasing drought in the next 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the bio-engineered trees could also fight against
high industrial pollution. Tests in some countries in which the
trees were planted in land not only of high salinity but also in
proximity to industrial pollution also proved successful.
</P>
<P>
This holds out a solution for cleaning and greening areas
particularly afflicted with industrial waste, the press release
claimed.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Economy Grows 3.9 Pct in 1st Half Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines registered a 3.9-
percent growth in its gross domestic product (GDP) in the first
half of 2000, against a 2.2-percent gain for the same period of
last year, the government said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Felipe Medalla said
at a press conference that the higher-than-expected growth was
based on the strong performance of aggregate services, as well as
a strong recovery in industry and the continued expansion of
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The country's industrial sector regained lost ground during the
first semester of 2000, climbing 4.1 percent from a negative 1.5
percent for the same period of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Services continued to push the economy forward, registering
positive growth for the 17th semester in a row. First semester
growth in services improved to 4.4 percent from the 3.5 percent
posted in the first semester of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of the agricultural sector for the first
semester was 2.3 percent against 5.8 percent registered in the
same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
For the second quarter alone, the country's GDP growth rate
reached 4.5 percent, way above the negative expectations of
government officials and market analysts who pegged it to the
market sentiments owing to the on-going conflict in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Medalla attributed the growth rate largely to the good
performance of the agricultural sector, which bounced back from a
poor performance in the first quarter, thus achieving a 4.8-
percent growth in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
This was followed by the services sector and the industrial
sector which grew by 5 percent and 3.7 percent respectively in the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
"Based on the strong performance of the economy in the first
semester, we are likely to achieve our GDP target of at least 4
percent for the year," Medalla said.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Government Gives Green Light to Controversial AIDS Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has given
green light to the controversial International AIDS conference to
be held at a Ugandan university beginning Tuesday, after the
organizers agreed to change its theme.
</P>
<P>
The theme has changed from "Alternative Views on the Origins
and Causes of AIDS in Africa" to "A Holistic Approach Towards the
Fight Against AIDS in Africa".
</P>
<P>
The President's Office, the Ministry of Health and the Uganda
AIDS Commission had reportedly feared the initial theme which
suggested a link with dissident view that HIV is not the cause of
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The AIDS Commission said in a press release that, "The
government stand is in line with the current mainstream scientific
view held by the international community that AIDS is caused by
HIV.
</P>
<P>
The release warns that any deviation from this position would
cause people to abandon their responsibilities in preventing the
infection.
</P>
<P>
The theme was modified after "intense and serious interactions"
with organizers, it said.
</P>
<P>
The four-day conference would reportedly contribute towards the
government's efforts to fight AIDS by exploring areas which have
so far not been sufficiently highlighted or emphasized.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Mubarak Meet on Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and U.S. President Bill Clinton held a one-hour-and-45-minute
meeting at the Cairo airport Tuesday on the stalled Middle East
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. official accompanying Clinton in the tour said
that the meeting would not produce "decisive results," but the
leaders from both states want to bring Israel and the Palestinians
closer through unremitting efforts.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who stopped over in Cairo on his way home at the end of
his three-day African tour, warned before the meeting that time was
running out to break the stalemate in the Palestinian-Israeli peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He added that he hope the two sides would overcome the hump and
strike a peace agreement by the self-imposed September 13 deadline.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, for his part, said he was "always hopeful." Clinton has
left Cairo after the brief meeting.
</P>
<P>
Clinton failed last month at the Camp David summit to bridge the
gaps between Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
The contentious issue of Jerusalem is the main deal-breaker in
the Palestinian-Israeli talks. The Palestinians want East Jerusalem
seized by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war and later annexed by it,
to be the capital of their future independent state
</P>
<P>
But Israel declares the whole city as its "undivided and eternal
capital."
</P>
<P>
After the collapse of the Camp David summit, both Israel and the
Palestinians launched international tour to rally support for their
positions in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is a key Arab mediator in the Mideast peace process.
Mubarak met over the weekend with Arafat and with Israel's acting
Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami earlier this month.

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Launch Anti-Measles Campaign Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Ministry of Health is to
launch a nationwide vaccination campaign next month to control
measles, the official daily Baghdad Observer reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has made all the necessary preparations, including
5,000 vaccination teams, 817 trucks to transport the teams and 150
health supervisors, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Some 900,000 Iraqi children from nine months to five years old
will be vaccinated through the campaign.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, the campaign aims to decrease infection
and mortality among children as a result of the measles.
</P>
<P>
The campaign will be in cooperation with the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health Organization (WHO),
said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has reeled under the 10-year stringent U.N. sanctions
sparked by its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
Beat Schweizer, head of the International Committee of the Red
Cross delegation in Iraq, has warned that Iraq's hospitals are
close to collapse.
</P>
<P>
Iraq reported that more than 10,000 people, including 7,457
children, died in July as a direct result of the malnutrition and
severe medicine shortage caused by the U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq claimed that this has brought the total number of victims
of the sanctions to 1,335,060 since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly accused the United States and British
members at the U.N. Sanctions Committee of blocking vital contracts
Iraq signed with foreign countries within the framework of the U.N.
oil-for-food program to import food, medicine and other basic
goods.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has from November 1996 allowed Iraq to sell oil in
return for humanitarian supplies under U.N. supervision.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Adjusts Telephone Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Telkom Kenya, the government-
owned communications firm, has lowered tariffs for international
and trunk calls, but raised local call charges.
</P>
<P>
Local media Tuesday quoted Telkom Kenya Managing Director
Angustine Cheserem as saying tariffs for long distance calls will
be lowered from 28 shillings (about 36 U.S. cents) to 21 shillings
(about 27 cents) a minute, representing a 25 percent reduction.
</P>
<P>
With regard to international tariffs, customers will enjoy
various savings depending on the distances. Calls to the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), customers will
enjoy a saving of 25.80 shillings (around 33 cents) per minute,
the rest of Africa, Europe and India, a saving of 46.40 shillings
(around 60 cents), and the rest of the world, a saving of 53.20
shillings (around 69 cents).
</P>
<P>
The cost of installing a new telephone line has fallen from 7,
000 shillings (about 90 dollars) to 4,600 shillings (about 60
dollars), a 34 percent decrease, but monthly access charges rise
to 354 shillings (about 4.6 dollars) from 225 shillings (about 2.9
dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, the charges for local calls will now cost 1.57
shillings per minute, up from 1.17 shillings and that for a local
three-minute call in public booth will be four shillings from
three shillings.
</P>
<P>
Callers will also make extra savings if they call at night,
public holidays or weekends, Cheserem said, adding that it is
expected to put pressure on mobile phone operators to reduce
tariffs.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has decided to sell the 49 percent of
shares of the Telkom Kenya to domestic and foreign investors, and
the bidding process in now underway.

<HEADLINE> United Airlines, Pilots Reach Tentative Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Representatives of the Air Line Pilots Association and United
Airlines spent the last two days negotiating around the clock to
strike the deal, which now is subject to ratification by the
pilots.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides worked hard in complex negotiations to create an
industry leading contract for pilots while providing a strong base
for the company's future growth and success," United Chief
Executive Officer James Goodwin said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
United Airline's pilots have been working without a contract
since April and many have refused to work overtime, which has led
to flight delays and cancellations throughout the airline's
network.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased that the recent intensive negotiations have
produced a tentative agreement for pilots at United Airlines,"
Capt. Rick Dubinsky, chairman of the UAL master executive council,
said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
United canceled thousands of flights this summer and had an
abysmal on-time record. United apologized in newspaper ads and
with a television commercial in which Goodwin says the airline has
failed in its commitment to customers.
</P>
<P>
"This summer, thousands of people had their travel plans
disrupted while flying United Airlines. If you were one of them, I
want to apologize personally on behalf of United," Goodwin says
from the cabin of a parked United jet in the commercial.

ZHUHAI, August 29 (Xinhua) -- A variety of South American
camomile recently found in forests near the southern Chinese city
of Zhuhai is threatening the survival of trees there.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by experts from the Tropical Forest
Institute, under the China Academy of Forestry, the camomile,
known as "tree killer", has been found in some 10 places with a
total area of nearly 10 hectares.
</P>
<P>
"This camomile usually enlaces trees before killing them by
stopping their photosynthesis," experts said.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, there have been no effective measures so
far to deal with this "tree killer" which was introduced into
China's coastal areas in the 1980s.

<HEADLINE> China Surveys Oil and Gas Resources in Yellow Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou Oceanic Geological
Surveying Bureau of south China's Guangdong Province has sent a
vessel into the Yellow Sea to start a new round of investigations
into oil and gas resources in the region.
</P>
<P>
Various new technologies will be used in the surveys, said a
spokesman with the team.
</P>
<P>
With an area of 400,000 sq km, the Yellow Sea begins from the
estuary of Yalu River in the north and ends at the northern bank
of the Yangtze River Estuary. The depth of the sea water is less
than 60 meters.
</P>
<P>
Speaking from a geological point of view, the Yellow Sea has
favorable oil- and gas-bearing prospects. However, no positive
results have ever been reported. China launched its first surveys
on oil and gas in the Yellow Sea in late 1960 and also carried out
prospecting into two places in the sea in cooperation with foreign
partners in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Application of new technologies and advanced equipment nowadays
would make things different, said the spokesman, adding that they
hoped to achieve a breakthrough before 2005 to promote commercial
prospecting in Yellow Sea.

<HEADLINE> HK to Launch Trial Employment Scheme for Disableds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Labor Department
announced Monday that it would launch a new trial placement scheme
on September 1 to encourage employers to offer job vacancies to
people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
Under this scheme, the Selective Placement Division of the
Labor Department would refer suitable job seekers with
disabilities to fill the vacancies offered by participating
employers for a one-month trial placement.
</P>
<P>
"During this period, placement officers will actively follow up
on the performance of the employees and assist them to settle in
the jobs as soon as possible," Siu Lap-kei, a senior labor officer,
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Participating employers will receive a financial incentive
amounting to 50 percent of the wages paid to the employee during
the trial period. The maximum subsidy will be 3,000 HK dollars (
385 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
A Certificate of Appreciation will be awarded to employers who
continue to employ the disabled employees for at least another
month after the trial period. Employees who have successfully
completed the trial placement will also be presented with a
Certificate of Commendation.
</P>
<P>
The trial scheme is the extension of an earlier pilot scheme
for job-seekers who are mentally handicapped. The pilot scheme,
launched in April 1998, proved to be very successful as about half
of the 199 participants were offered permanent employment after
the trial placement period.

MACAO, August 28 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of judges of the
Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) left here Monday for a
four-day visit to neighboring Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
"The trip is aimed at increasing channels of contact and laying

head of the delegation and president of the Court of Final Appeal

<P>
The delegation will visit courts in Guangzhou and nearby cities.
Judges of Macao and Guangdong will brief each other on their
respective judicial systems, discuss ways to strengthen personnel
training and seek judicial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Because of the difference in judicial systems and the lack of
judicial agreements, the court rulings made at one place sometimes
are difficult to be carried out by the judicial organs of the
other place, Hou Fai said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the trip is made for Macao and Guangdong to
maintain close relations and that the Macao SAR will seek more
judicial cooperation with other parts of the inland areas of China
in the future.

<HEADLINE> Peace is Essential for Growth in Sri Lanka: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior Sri Lankan government
official has stressed that peace was essential for the economic
growth of the island nation, which has been severely affected by a
bloody 17-year civil war between government forces and separatist
Tamil Tiger rebels.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a public meeting at the Seethawaka Industrial Park
here on Tuesday, Minister of Economic and Industrial Development
Ronnie de Mel said that as long as the war continued, both foreign
investors and tourists were reluctant to come to Sri Lanka. Even
local investment was slow and economic development was retarded.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was for this reason that the efforts for peace
by President Kumaratunga should be supported. He had throughout
stood for peace and was ready to make any sacrifice to achieve it.
</P>
<P>
Having participated in the talks on the new draft constitution,
he stressed that the main opposition United National Party (UNP),
which he represented at that time, had agreed to 98 percent of the
proposals and the final draft contained at least 50 percent of the
UNP's proposals.
</P>
<P>
He added that at the penultimate meeting the UNP had agreed to
support the draft constitution but backed out thereafter. No
person who had the country at heart and wanted peace could remain
in such a party or vote for it, he said.
</P>
<P>
The draft constitution was aimed at bringing the ethnic war to
an early end by devolving greater autonomy to the minority Tamils
but aborted in adoption in the Parliament recently.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that despite the ongoing war unemployment had
been reduced for the first time in 30 years and despite an
expenditure of over 80 billion rupees (1.022 billion U.S. dollars)
on defense, the budget deficit and inflation of the country still
remained in single digits.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government plans to change the structure of
industrial development in the country from the old economy based
on textiles and garments to a new economy based on technology.

CANBERRA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- 26 Illegal immigrants were
captured and carried from Woomera Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They were suspected ringleaders in Monday's riot at Woomera
detention center, the Australian Associated Press AAP reported.
</P>
<P>
AAP said "Federal and South Australian police herded 26 male
asylum seekers into a fortified police van and a minibus for what
was expected to be the long road trip to the Adelaide Remand
Center."

In the event, six buildings were torched and 32 security guards
injured in attacks with slingshots and makeshift spears, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
When the vehicles were leaving, other detainees attempted to
break through the side windows of the bus. They hammered the
windows with their fists before being restrained by police on the
bus. They were mainly middle-aged and young men and were dressed
in tracksuit pants and tops. Some were without shoes, AAP reported.
</P>
<P>
Australian Federal Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock said
Monday that authorities considered charges against them.
</P>
<P>
Many of the rioters had recently been refused refugee status in
Australia. Immigration department spokesman Roger Wheatley was
quoted as saying that "the mood is very quiet and the place is
back to some semblance of normality."
</P>
<P>
The camp is 470 kms north of Adelaide and detains 732 illegal
immigrants mainly from Iran and Afghanistan. They have to wait
years for an answer to their applications for living in the
country. Many of the Monday rioters had been informed their
applications were refused.

<HEADLINE> Australian Sports Minister Welcomes EPO Test Approval </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Australian Sports Minister
Jackie Kelly Tuesday welcomed the decision of the International
Olympic Committee (IOC) to approve tests for the banned
performance-enhancing drug EPO at the Sydney Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Jackie Kelly said in Canberra that the introduction of the new
test meant Sydney would have the world's toughest drug testing
program.
</P>
<P>
"We want all athletes who compete at Sydney to do so fairly and
without the benefit of performance enhancing drugs," she said.
</P>
<P>
"We now have an effective and reliable way to catch EPO cheats,
" she said.
</P>
<P>
EPO, or erythropoietin, was the drug believed to be used by
some athletes in endurance sports and events such as long-distance
running and cycling.
</P>
<P>
The IOC's ruling executive board overnight backed a
recommendation from IOC legal experts that the combined blood and
urine tests be allowed to go ahead.
</P>
<P>
Kelly said the decision vindicated the 1.5 million Australian
dollars (885,000 U.S. dollars) the Australian federal government
had spent funding research for the tests, which were developed by
Australian and French scientists.

<HEADLINE> Security to Be Intensified at Sydney's Olympic Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Security at Sydney's Olympic
site will be raised a notch from Tuesday following an intensive
police and army sweep of the massive Main Press Center (MPC),
organising officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Journalists and photographers covering the Games will be
subject to detailed searches after the 40,000-square-meter site
receives a final security clearance.
</P>
<P>
Only a handful of the expected 5,500 working media are
currently using the venue, and Tuesday's nine-hour sweep is part
of a process encompassing the whole Olympic park, which will
culminate on Friday.
</P>
<P>
MPC venue commander Superintendent Frank Hansen compared the
security measures in the press center to those of an airport, with
journalists and photographers subject to magnetic scanning via an
x-ray machine from Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We don't anticipate finding anything but it's a precautionary
thing," Hansen said.
</P>
<P>
"(From) a layman's point of view, it's very similar to the
protection that's run in airports."
</P>
<P>
The media center, made up of six pavilions and two temporary
structures, is the size of six football fields and cost 25 million
Australian dollars (14.75 million U.S. dollars) to build.
</P>
<P>
The world's media will descend on the center leading into the
start of the Games on September 15.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Olympic Athletes Urged to Do Nation Proud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Minister for
Sport, Fitness and Leisure Trevor Mallard Tuesday urged the New
Zealand athletes travelling to the Sydney Olympic Games to do
themselves and their nation proud.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued by the New Zealand government,
Mallard noted the New Zealand government has a goal to strengthen
national identity.
</P>
<P>
"High performance sport is an important vehicle to achieving
that goal," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the modern sporting era, Mallard said, it is not easy for
New Zealand, one of the smallest nations on the sporting circuit,
to succeed on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
"You can't all win golds, but I am keen to see plenty of
personal bests. I am sure you will do yourself and your nation
proud," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"My advice, for what is worth, to athletes attending these
Games would be to keep your heads down and fucus on what you are
there for. You are there to represent your country at the highest
level and to strive to do your personal best on the day," he said.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand will send a 152-strong team to the Sydney Olympic
Games, according to an earlier report.

<HEADLINE> Defending Champions Enter Ailing in U.S. Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Open begins today
with defending champions Andre Agassi and Serena Williams, though
ailing, among the favorites.
</P>
<P>
Struggling with a sore back, top-ranked Agassi ended his
preparation for the season's final Grand Slam event by losing to
Alex Corretja last week in the Legg Mason final. At the same
event, Agassi and partner Sargis Sargsian were beaten by Jared
Palmer and Alex O'Brien in the doubles final.
</P>
<P>
"It was a good week for me in many ways," Agassi said, "I got
to play some matches, and I got to ask my back to hold up in
singles and doubles. I've got to say it was good."
</P>
<P>
Agassi opens with wild card Alex Kim tonight in Arthur Ashe
Stadium in New York. "Any arena that you win in leaves you with
excitement and momentum no matter where things are when you return
a year later."
</P>
<P>
Former champion John McEnroe expects Agassi to meet No. 4 seed
Pete Sampras in the semifinals. No. 2 Gustavo Kuerten and No. 3
Magnus Norman are bracketed to meet in the other semifinal. No. 6
seed Marat Safin and No. 12 Juan Carlos Ferrero and unseeded Pat
Rafter, a two-time champion, are among the other contenders.
</P>
<P>
On the women's side, Serena Williams' challengers include her
streaking big sister Venus, the No. 3 seed and two former
champions of No. 1 Martina Hingis in 1997 and No. 2 Lindsay
Davenport in 1998. No. 5 Serena beat Davenport in Los Angeles
early this month, but her nine-match winning streak ended last
week when she was forced to retire against Hingis in the du
Maurier final, trailing 0-6, 6-3, and 3-0.
</P>
<P>
The Williams sister hope to make the season's final Grand Slam
event a family affair by meeting in the final. "That would be a
dream come true," said Venus who missed playing her sister in last
year's final, losing to Hingis in the semifinal.
</P>
<P>
Wimblendon champion Venus is the favorite as she has a 19-match
winning streak. She won her fourth consecutive title on Saturday,
defeating No. 6 Monica Seles 6-2, 6-4 in the Pilot Pen in New
Haven.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Implement New Stock Trading System Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seven full trial operations will take place next month and the
system will be installed over a three-month period from October if
all goes well, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The third generation of the Automatic Order Matching and
Execution System (AMS/3), which costs 250 million HK dollars (32
million U.S. dollars), will enable investors to place orders
directly from their personal computers or mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
However, the system will perform only basic trading functions
during its three-month trial, when investors will benefit from
faster executions than on the present trading system.
</P>
<P>
AMS/3 allows single traders to be conducted in one second,
compared with the 2.5 seconds on AMS/2 at present.
</P>
<P>
The new system would be able to handle 200 transactions per
second, against 75 using AMS/2.
</P>
<P>
More functions will be added into the trial and 40 selected
brokers will be allowed to trade via the Internet or mobile phone.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Economy Expands Despite Long running Ethnic War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's economy is expanding
despite ongoing 17-year ethnic conflict between government forces
and separatist Tamil Tiger rebels, Daily News reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the International Herald Tribune in it's
Saturday edition as saying that the Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
of Sri Lanka grew six percent in the first half of this year on
rising exports, garments and tea. The government predicts its
economy will grow by 5 to 5.5 percent for the full year.
</P>
<P>
Exporters keep their foreign exchange earnings and maximum
import tariff stands at a relatively modest 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that Sri Lanka, the world's biggest tea exporter,
accounts for 20 percent of tea in the global market. The country
also benefits from strong textiles and clothing exports and gem
mining.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan officials has said that the momentum for change
was still strong but admitted that the war casts a pall on the
economic outlook.
</P>
<P>
The paper sees foreign investments as one of the hardest hit
segments of the economy. Potential foreign investment lost between
1984 and 1996 amounts to 71 percent of GDP in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Direct expenditure on defense has risen from 1.3 percent of GDP
in 1980 to 4 to 6 percent in recent years. The government was
forced to increase its defense expenditure due to the lack of
sophisticated weapons in the battle fronts to win the war from
Tamil Tiger rebels.
</P>
<P>
It adds that the long-running ethnic conflict has diverted a
tremendous amount on the impoverished island nation's resources.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Ask Rich Nations to Bridge Gap at U.N. Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan, who will attend the
September 6-8 summit in New York, was quoted as saying that the
United Nations Development Program was interested in bridging the
gap as it strives to link the international community through the
internet.
</P>
<P>
Surin also stressed the need to stop poverty and the lingering
problem of debt.
</P>
<P>
Developed countries must inject foreign direct investments into
developing countries and extend real technology transfers, not
just relocate their manufacturing bases for re-export benefits, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Rich countries should also train developing states to develop
themselves in terms of science and technology, Surin said.
</P>
<P>
He would also use the summit to ask the Asian Development Bank
to support research into the design of industrial goods in
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
It would also help, he said, if the United Nations called on
multinational companies with branches in developing countries to
use local resources for research.
</P>
<P>
The minister hoped the annual U.N. General Assembly, which
opens after the summit, would declare a decade of Mekong
Development with the support of the ADB and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Mekong subregion needed help because of the gap between
ASEAN members stemmed from the economic, social and political
transitions of the new members Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the
Pacific agreed to call 2000 to 2010 a Mekong Development Decade at
its annual session in May.

<HEADLINE> GA Leader: Millennium World Peace Summit Is "Timely and Right" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 28 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations General
Assembly (UNGA) leader Monday said that the convocation of the "
Millennium World Peace Summit" at the United Nations headquarters
in New York is "both timely and right."
</P>
<P>
The summit, which has attracted more than 1,000 religious
leaders from the world's major religious communities, includes
seven top gurus from China's five major faith disciplines, who
have gathered here to forge partnerships of peace with the United
Nations and each other.
</P>
<P>
The four-day summit is expected to focus on four broad sets of
issues: conflict transformation, elimination of poverty,
forgiveness and reconciliation, and preservation and restoration
of environment.
</P>
<P>
Arthur Mbanefo, vice-president of the UNGA, told the
representatives at the summit's opening ceremony, "Your presence
here today is indeed a powerful testimony of your desire and
commitment to see peace prevail in all corners of the world."
</P>
<P>
"It is right because it takes place at a moment in history.
Problems connected with religious, cultural and ethnic intolerance
as well as racism, xenophobia and other forms of bigotry are
rapidly increasing," said Mbanefo who is also the Nigerian
permanent representative to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"The summit is appropriate in the sense that the international
community at large is involved in a serious dialogue among
religious personalities and civilizations with a view to building
bridges across cultural, ethnic and religious divides," he said. "
The tremendous weight of religion and its positive impact must be
brought to bear on the search for holistic solutions to peace,
cooperation and development."
</P>
<P>
It is also timely because the summit takes place at the
beginning of a new era and coincides with the "Millennium Summit
of the United Nations" which is scheduled for September 6-8, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Intensifies Security Before Clinton's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, August 28 (Xinhua) --Because of the impending visit of
U.S. President Bill Clinton to the Caribbean city of Cartagena,
Colombia, security operations have been extended to include other
cities, a high-ranking security official said.
</P>
<P>
Among the cities included are Barranquilla and Santa Marta,
Director of the National Police General Luis Ernesto Gilibert
Vargas said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The senior officer said his institution "took the cities"
during the weekend, specially in the northern coast region, to
prevent access by criminals during the U.S. president's visit.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will arrive at Cartagena on Wednesday for a 10-hour
visit. Security in this city is already tight.
</P>
<P>
Vargas explained that the goal of this deployment, a joint
operation with U.S. police, is to send criminals a clear message
that police will be able to control any criminal activity at
anytime. He did not, however, disclose the number of the forces
deployed in the areas.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will meet his Colombian counterpart Andres Pastrana and
demonstrate his support for Pastrana's efforts to fight drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The United States has agreed to deliver 1.3 billion U.S.
dollars for the Colombian president's anti-drug "Plan of Colombia.

<HEADLINE> Mexican-U.S. Sugar Dispute Remains Unresolved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The sugar trade controversy
between Mexico and the United States remained unresolved, said the
Mexican Foreign Trade Ministry on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mexico presented its case to the Free Trade Commission of the
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on August 17 after
negotiations between the two countries failed, said the ministry
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Mexico asked the U.S. Trade Department for a yearly quota of
550,000 tons of sugar, considering the damage caused by U.S.
fructose to the Mexican sugar industry.
</P>
<P>
The United States only offered a quota of 110,000 tons, said
Luis de la Calle, vice trade minister of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The situation is complicated by another document the United
States modified at the last moment to avoid problems with its own
sugar industry, said De la Calle.
</P>
<P>
The sugar dispute adds to existing problems on the transport of
goods in which the United States has imposed certain restrictions
on Mexican truck drivers

<P>
BELGRADE, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Foreign Trade Minister
Borislav Vukovic said Monday that there exist no trade barriers
between Yugoslavia and Russia after signing a bilateral free trade
agreement on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Vukovic made the remarks at the signing ceremony of the accord,
which will gradually reduce customs tariffs to zero over a period
of five years.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the trade agreement will promote bilateral
economic and trade development and attract more Russian businesses
to the Yugoslav market, particularly in the reconstruction of post-
war Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The trade agreement, which went into immediate effect, will
exempt the majority part of the bilateral trade from customs
tariffs.
</P>
<P>
However, customs tariffs will still be imposed on some goods
such as Russian-made mobile phones, automobiles and machinery
equipment for the time being, as well as some Yugoslav-made
products of medicines, textiles, furniture, candies and chocolates.
</P>
<P>
With the new trade agreement, the trade volume between the two
countries is expected to grow 7 percent to 10 percent from the
present level by the end of this year, experts said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Sports Minister Welcomes EPO Test Approval </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Australian Sports Minister
Jackie Kelly Tuesday welcomed the decision of the International
Olympic Committee (IOC)to approve tests for the banned performance-
enhancing drug EPO at the Sydney Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
She said in Canberra that the introduction of the new test
meant Sydney would have the world's toughest drug testing program.
</P>
<P>
"We want all athletes who compete at Sydney to do so fairly and
without the benefit of performance enhancing drugs," she said.
</P>
<P>
"We now have an effective and reliable way to catch EPO cheats,
" she said.
</P>
<P>
EPO, or erythropoietin, was the drug believed to be used by
some athletes in endurance sports and events such as long-distance
running and cycling.
</P>
<P>
The IOC's ruling executive board overnight backed a
recommendation from IOC legal experts that the combined blood and
urine tests be allowed to go ahead.
</P>
<P>
Kelly said the decision vindicated the 1.5 million Australian
dollars (885,000 U.S. dollars) the Australian federal government
had spent funding research for the tests, which were developed by
Australian and French scientists.

CANBERRA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The council of Sutherland Shire,
in the south of Sydney and home to Australia's only nuclear
reactor, Monday night voted in favour of requesting the reactor's
shutting until after the Olympics and Paralympics because of a
terrorist threat.
</P>
<P>
Sutherland Shire council voted 10-5 in favour of a mayoral
minute urging the government to shut the facility until after the
Games.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand police were probing an immigration racket involving
Afghan refugees when they stumbled on plans that appeared to point
to an attack on the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor.
</P>
<P>
Despite the concerns of residents, the government has said it
will not close the facility.
</P>
<P>
Australian federal Health Minister Michael Wooldridge said on
Sunday the facility had to remain open for nuclear medicine.
</P>
<P>
The site was closed twice in the past year, once for
refurbishment and once during a workers' strike.
</P>
<P>
"During those closures, there was no loss of nuclear medical
services for the people of Sydney, and there is absolutely no
reason why they cannot close this reactor at this time when there
is a threat being made," Sutherland Mayor Ken McDonnell said in a
radio interview.

BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- China is building its largest
genetic chip manufacturing plant in Guangdong Province, according
to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
Shanghai BioWindow Gene Development Company Limited and
Zhaoqing Star Lake Biotech Company Limited have announced they are
to establish the new company with a total investment of 250
million yuan (30 million US dollars), in Zhaoqing in south China's
Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai BioWindow Gene Development Company, a Fudan
University-based company, agreed to invest its technology in the
new company while its partner Zhaoqing Star Lake Biotech will
provide the financial banking.
</P>
<P>
"For the moment, BioWindow's products and technology are mainly
used in clinical diagnosis," said Qing Yilong, general manager of
Shanghai-based United Gene-Tech (Group) Company Limited, the
parent group of BioWindow,
</P>
<P>
Their products include genetic chips that are used for
diagnosing prenatal hereditary diseases and liver cancer.
</P>
<P>
Without the help of genetic chips, researchers used to be
restricted to analyzing one gene relating to one disease, at a
time.
</P>
<P>
But by using the chip, they can inspect thousands of genes at
one time and analyze any number of diseases.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Satellite Develops Fatal Malfunction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO, August 28 (Xinhua)-- The Mexican Satellites company (
Satmex) said Monday it has lost contact with its
telecommunications satellite "Solidarity 1" due to a malfunction
on it registered Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We lost contact with its central mainframe," said Satmex
President Lauro Gonzalez. "If communication is not re-established
on Monday, the satellite will be definitely out of service."
</P>
<P>
The malfunction, which was detected at 10:45 local time (1645
GMT), has affected banks, Internet networks, and radio and
television broadcasting, and telephone services.
</P>
<P>
The 107 subscribers to the satellite were forced to turn to
other Satmex satellites or foreign partners, said Gonzalez, adding
that the loss of the satellite would cause an annual income loss
of 20 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The construction and launching of a new satellite would cost
250 million U.S. dollars and would take about 30 months, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Solidarity 1, built by the U.S. Hughes Communications
company and launched in 1993, registered flaws in April and May
1999. It should be in service for seven more years.

XI'AN, August 29 (Xinhua) -- A 28-year-old woman had her five
fingers cut from her hand in an accident but had four of them
successfully reconnected after being operated on at the Xijing
Hospital, based in Xi'an, capital of northwest China's Shaanxi
Province.
</P>
<P>
The patient Shan was working at a printing company in Chang'an
County. She had the five fingers of her right hand cut off by a
cutting machine when she was working there recently.
</P>
<P>
Shan was taken to the Xijing Hospital four hours later after
the accident occurred.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Cong Rui reconnected Shan's index finger, middle finger
and the pinkie finger to her hand and removed the cut ring finger,
which could not be connected, to make the thumb.
</P>
<P>
At present, all the fingers are in good condition, according to
the doctor.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the function of the thumb accounts for 40
percent of the whole hand, while the ring finger only accounts for
10 percent. Removing the broken ring finger to make the thumb can
guarantee the normal function of the whole hand.
</P>
<P>
Xijing Hospital successfully reconnected 10 fingers for a
patient in 1986, that were cut off. It was the first case in the
world. In 1993 and 1996, the hospital also successfully helped two
patients restore their nine cut-off fingers.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Milestone on Road Towards Burundi Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Zhang Dacheng
</P>
<P>
ARUSHA, Tanzania, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Thirteen of the 19
warring parties of Burundi signed in Arusha, northern Tanzania on
Monday a historic peace agreement aimed at ending a seven-year
civil conflict in the country.
</P>
<P>
Among the signatories are the Burundi government, the Burundi
National Assembly, seven Hutu parties and four major Tutsi parties.
</P>
<P>
The 175-page Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement, a
blueprint for founding a new Burundi characterized by peace,
democracy and equality, sets up a milestone on the road for a
lasting peace in the war-torn tiny central African state.
</P>
<P>
The agreement contains five protocols dealing with nature of
the conflicts, democracy and good governance, peace and security,
reconstruction and development, and guarantees on agreement
implementation.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to put aside our differences in all the
manifestations in order to promote the factors that are common to
us and which unite us, and to work together for the realization of
the higher interests of the people of Burundi," the agreement
reads.
</P>
<P>
With a territory of only 26,000 square kilometers and a little
more than six million inhabitants, Burundi has witnessed five
military coups which killed two of its seven presidents since
independence in 1962.
</P>
<P>
More than 200,000 Burundians, mostly civilian, have been killed
and about 300,000 fled to neighboring countries since October 1993
when Burundi's first democratically elected president Melchior
Ndadaye, a Hutu, was assassinated by pro-Tutsi soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The fifth coup on July 25, 1996 brought Major Pierre Buyoya, a
Tutsi by ethnic, again to power, inflicting all-out economic
sanctions by neighboring states effective on July 31, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the current bloody civil war has
brought 40 years back the country's economic and social
development, making it among the 10 poorest countries in the world
with a per capita gross domestic product of only 106 U.S. dollars
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
It is recognized in the agreement that the long-term turmoil in
Burundi was rooted deeply into the past colonial period. During
the pre-colonial period, all the ethnic groups inhabiting Burundi
owed allegiance to the same monarch and everyone recognized
himself as Burundi.
</P>
<P>
But under the colonial administration, first German and then
Belgian, since 1890, the ethnic awareness was enhanced by propping
up the Tutsis, who account for 14 percent of the total population,
over the Hutus, who account for 85 percent, with the intention of
instigating political violence.
</P>
<P>
From that period through to the present, the minority Tutsis
have been monopolizing the leadership in political, economic and
military sectors with the majority Hutus under their rule,
incurring widespread resentment.
</P>
<P>
A difficult national reconciliation in Burundi took a turn for
the better in June 1998 as Tanzanian founding president Julius
Nyerere initiated the peace talks in the northern Tanzanian town
of Arusha to provide a forum for all the warring parties to
explore ways on a equal basis for ending the conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks were encouraged by the Great Lakes region
states which suspended in January 1999 their economic sanctions
against Burundi. However, the sudden death of Nyerere of Leukemia
in October 1999 brought the talks to a deadlock.
</P>
<P>
With the support of the Great Lakes region and the
international community, former South African president Nelson
Mandela succeeded Nyerere as the new facilitator. Mandela managed
to resume the peace talks, paid two visits to Burundi on site
probing, and invited the armed rebels active in Burundi to carry
forward the on-going peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, a 82-year-old anti-apartheid hero, presented a draft
peace agreement to the negotiators, culminating in the signing
ceremony on August 28.
</P>
<P>
However, it should be pointed out that a peaceful future is
still under the threat by some instability factors.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, two main pro-Hutu armed rebel groups, the CNDD-FDD and
the PALIPEHUTU-FNL, have stayed away from the peace talks from the
very beginning and refused to join the signatories, casting a
shadow on the smooth and effective implementation of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the final agreement retains what all the parties
agree with as well as those they do not. The disagreement,
especially on the arrangements of cease-fire and transitional
leadership, may leave the agreement a pact without cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, many negotiators at the peace talks complained that a
final peace agreement probably would bring instability, instead of
peace, to the future generations if it was not discussed and
debated thoroughly but rushed for signing.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said if peace is not set on a solid base,
Burundi Tutsis would probably suffer the tragedy like that
happened in neighboring Rwanda in 1994 when more than half a
million civilians, mostly Tutsis who shared the ruling power with
Hutus, were brutally killed.
</P>
<P>
A perpetual solution of the Burundian conflict is that the
ruling power should be fairly and reasonably distributed between
the two ethnic tribes, they said.
</P>
<P>
All the parties, including the facilitation team, should
undertake discussion patiently and meticulously to try to find the
road to a lasting peaceful coexistence, they warned.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the signing of the peace agreement shows that the
African states have improved their conflict-solving abilities and
that the Burundians are more and more tired of the endless
bloodshed and are increasingly admiring peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Laying a milestone in the history of Burundi, the Arusha peace
agreement reminds the Burundians of the long way ahead to a
peaceful and destination, which commands courage and vision.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Blast Rocks Cape Town Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 29 (Xinhua) -- A bomb explosion rocked
Adderley Street in Cape Town shortly after 4 p.m., Cape Town
police reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, spokesman Captain Rod Beer said he had no further
details and was unable to say where precisely the explosion
occurred or whether anyone had been injured.
</P>
<P>
The African National Congress (ANC) lambasted the bomb attack in
a statement, saying that "to say that we are shocked and outraged
has become a cliche and may have lost some meaning".
</P>
<P>
"What sent shivers down our spine is the fact that these
attacks are becoming more daring in broad daylight and in places
which even more directly endanger people's lives," the statement
said.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Hails Burundian Peace Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Belgium Tuesday welcomed a
peace agreement signed Monday by Burundi's warring political
factions, saying it was the first step towards a lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the move
towards peace has accelerated, "but peace is not yet actual."
</P>
<P>
"The political parties that have not signed the August 28
accord, as well as the rebels and armed groups, cannot remain
apart. It is up to them now to sign up as well... rather than to
continue to fight," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Belgian Foreign Minister Louis Michel, who was in Tanzania for
the signing of Burundi's power-sharing agreement aimed at ending
the African country's seven-year civil war, was involved in some
of the sensitive negotiations and made several trips to the area.
</P>
<P>
"Peace in Burundi could be an important step towards
stabilizing the Great Lakes region," the Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The Great Lakes region includes the former Belgian colonies of
the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Congo-Brazzaville, Rwanda
and Burundi -- stricken by civil unrest and international conflict.
</P>
<P>
Belgium also pledged to play an active role in the donors'
conference to be organized at the request of former South African
President Nelson Mandela, who was a key broker of the Burundi
peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Peace in Burundi is still far from being realized because six
armed groups, including two main Hutu groups fighting against the
Tutsi-dominated government, have not signed the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Several heads of state, including U.S. President Bill Clinton,
were present at the signing ceremony in Arusha, Tanzania, Monday.

<HEADLINE> China's Top Legislator Stresses Three Principles for Parliamentary Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 29 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator Li Peng
said here Tuesday that China maintains the people of every country
should have the right to choose their own way of development.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with Lee Man-Sup, speaker of the National
Assembly of the Republic of Korea, Li said that it is one of the
three principles China wants to stress at the upcoming Conference
of Presiding Officers of National Parliaments, a three-day event
to begin at the United Nations here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
China also proposes that all countries, regardless of their
sizes, should be equal. The sovereignty of each independent
country should not be violated and no country should interfere in
other's internal affairs under whatever pretext, Li said.
</P>
<P>
China hopes that all the three principles will be widely
acknowledged by participants in the conference, said Li, who, for
the first time ever, is to attend the conference as chairman of
China's National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the conference will discuss such topics as
strengthening the role of parliaments in international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Lee spoke positively of the development of ROK-China relations,
and invited Li to visit ROK. Li also invited the ROK speaker to
visit China again.

<HEADLINE> Fiji's Former Prime Minister in Britain to Seek Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Fiji's former Prime Minister
Mahendra Chaudhry arrived here Tuesday as part of his designed
tour to seek support for his overthrown government.
</P>
<P>
Chaudhry was scheduled to hold talks Wednesday with
Commonwealth Secretary General Don McKinnon before leaving for
Brussels.
</P>
<P>
He had already visited India, New Zealand and Australia, and
plans to return to London next Monday to meet with officials from
Britain's Foreign Office.
</P>
<P>
The British government is currently keeping on pushing for the
restoration of democratic government in Fiji. Chaudhry's
government was overthrown earlier this year by rebels intent on
reasserting the dominance of the indigenous Fijian population over
the island's ethnic Indian population.
</P>
<P>
Britain has called on Fiji's interim civilian government, which
is backed by the military, to set a timetable for the restoration
of democratic rule.

Chavez said that South American integration must be total, not
only limited to economic and trading areas, but also to political,
social and cultural ones.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, both leaders highlighted the importance of
the next South American Summit from Thursday to Friday in Brazil
for regional integration.

<HEADLINE> Greek, Cypriot Foreign Ministers Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou on Tuesday discussed with his visiting Cypriot
counterpart, Ioannis Kasoulides, the next round of U.N.-sponsored
proximity talks between Cyprus' two communities in New York next
month.
</P>
<P>
Describing the current phase of the Cyprus issue as "crucial,"
Papandreou said after the talks that there was a complete
coordination between the governments of Greece and Cyprus
concerning the actions and steps to be taken in the coming period.
</P>
<P>
He stated that the policy followed by the Greek side had Turkey
's European course as its basic goal.
</P>
<P>
"Greece has every reason to see Turkey in Europe, as this will
have an impact on both bilateral relations and the Cyprus issue,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Kasoulides, who arrived in Athens Tuesday, said
that the excellent cooperation between the governments of Greece
and Cyprus was the cornerstone of the success of its efforts for a
solution to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Greek side came to the talks with the
political will to reach a solution to the Cyprus problem,
stressing that Cyprus hoped that the talks would be substantive.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot minister expressed the hope that Turkey should
display a similar attitude.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and occupied the northern one-third of the island in the wake of a
failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Cyprus have signed a joint defense agreement and the
two countries have insisted that the eastern Mediterranean island
must be reunited in a federation formula in line with the U.N.
resolutions. But Turkey and northern Cyprus demand that a
confederation formed by two sovereign states be set up on the
island.

<HEADLINE> Moldovan Minister: IP-Telephony, Illegal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The rendering of telephone
services through Internet (IP-telephony) is totally illegal in
Moldova as the Ministry of Transport and Telecommunications has
not issued even a single license to run the business, the Moldovan
news agency Infotag quoted Minister Afanasie Smochin as saying
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"So all the companies offering such services violate the
existing legislation grossly," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
An IP-telephony operator in Moldova, who asked to withhold his
name, explained that "this type of business has not been regulated
in this republic in any way; hence it has not been prohibited."
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to officially apply for a corresponding license
in order to work legally, but nobody would issue one to us. The
Ministry of Transport and Telecommunications has been constantly
demanding we stop this IP activity. But any court will recognize
our actions as fully legal," said the company director.
</P>
<P>
IP-telephony is fairly widely spread in Moldova as it is
considerably cheaper than the tariffs charged by Moldtelecom, the
national telephone operator.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Mivan Kier company
started the construction of 1,860 welfare housing units in Romania,
the local media reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Romania Libera daily, Mivan Kier is the winner
of an international tender called by the Romanian Ministry of
Public Works and Urban and Regional Policy for a foreign credit of
60 million U.S. dollars of a total 340 million guaranteed by the
Romanian government and meant to complement the funds needed to
raise social benefit housing.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to build apartment blocks two to eight
stories high, with two- to three-room flats. They are going to be
raised in Bucharest and 20 other cities in the country.
</P>
<P>
The construction is planned to be completed by December 22,
2002. The beneficiary proper of the project is the Romanian
government through the Public Works Ministry. Financers are
Deutsche Bank AG London and the British government's Export Credit
Guarantee Department.
</P>
<P>
All construction is in line with Romanian standards, using
local materials or imported ones validated and registered in
Romania. Most of the engineers, managers and other staff are
Romanians, while the equipment and machinery needed for the
construction are imported, according to media here.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Demands Immediate Release of American Hostage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Tuesday
demanded the unconditional release of an American who was
kidnapped by Muslim rebels in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Philip Reeker said Jeffrey Schilling
of Oakland, California, had been seized by a faction of the Abu
Sayyaf guerrilla group, which has been holding six Europeans
captive for months on the Jolo Island, the Philippines. He said
several U.S. officials had gone to the southern Philippine city of
Zamboanga to speak to local officials about the kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
"The United States strongly condemns this latest kidnapping and
we call for the immediate, safe and unconditional release of this
hostage and the other hostages still held captive on the island of
Jolo," Reeker said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
Philippine officials confirmed that rebels had kidnapped an
American man and threatened to kill him unless the United States
accepts their demands. The rebels said they would reveal their
demands in three days.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the United States would accept Libyan help to secure
Schilling's release, Reeker said: "We support efforts by
negotiators, whomever they may be, to find a quick resolution" so
long as ransom is not paid. U.S. policy bars payments to buy
hostage freedom.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's premature to make any specific statements on any
requests or offers or issues specifically involving the case,
because we're trying to determine all the facts," Reeker said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Trying to Soothe Colombians Over Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Tuesday tried to placate uneasiness among Colombians that a 1.3
billion dollar anti-drug plan marked growing U.S. intervention in
that country.
</P>
<P>
"Please do not misunderstand our purpose," Clinton said in a
videotaped message to the Colombian people on the ever of his trip
to the country. "We have no military objective. We do not believe
your conflict has a military solution. We support the peace
process. Our approach is both pro-peace and anti-drug."
</P>
<P>
Last Week, Clinton signed a waiver to release 1.3 billion
dollars in aid for Colombia for the so-called anti-drug plan in
that country. The United States will dispatch about 60 helicopters
and deploy U.S.-trained army battalions in an offensive against
traffickers and rebels protecting drug plantations in southern
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Now U.S. military advisers have begun training two special army
battalions there. Their mission is to protect Colombian police to
destroy drug plantations and labs.
</P>
<P>
Colombia and its neighbors are concerned that the aid package
will escalate fighting in a 36-year-old guerrilla war in the
nation, which is likely to push the fighting over the borders,
along with waves of refugees and displacement of drug trade itself.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the United States was only contributing to
Colombia's own 7.5 billion dollar plan for the fighting of drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
"Let me be clear about the role of the United States," he said.
"First, it is not for us to propose a plan. We are supporting the
Colombians plan. You are leading. We are providing assistance as a
friend and a neighbor."
</P>
<P>
Clinton will visit Colombia Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Carrefour to Enter Romanian Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The famous French Retail group
Carrefour will enter the Romanian market by opening the first
hypermarket in Bucharest in the first half of next year, the local
newspaper Ziarul Financiar reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We intend to open several hypermarkets in Bucharest and
afterwards in the cities having more than 300,000 inhabitants,"
Carrefour general manager for Romania F. Olivier was quoted as
saying. "Romania is an important market of 22 million people and
it is very likely to develop very fast as soon as it joins the
European Union and NATO," he added.
</P>
<P>
Olivier explained that the choice of the next city to benefit
from a hypermarket would be a matter of opportunity. At present,
beside Bucharest, there are seven cities with a population of more
than 300,000, i.e., Brasov, Cluj, Constanta, Craiova, Galati, Iasi
and Timisoara.
</P>
<P>
The investment needed to open a hypermarket can be 20 to 40
million U.S. dollars. The investment made for the inauguration of
the first hypermarket placed on the Bucharest-Ploiesti highway is
closer to the upper limit, Olivier said. The sales area will be
nearly 9,000 sqm, to which the commercial gallery of about 6,000
sqm will be added. The hypermarket will have a parking lot for 2,
000 cars.
</P>
<P>
The offer will cover all necessary daily shopping, from food to
clothes. Market analysts estimate that as long as the purchasing
power does not boost significantly in the coming years,
competition among major retailers will be strengthened. Carrefour'
s representative in Romania was very reserved when he came to
comment on competition.
</P>
<P>
"Our target is to offer our customers diversity, innovation, as
well as the best prices and services," Olivier said.

<HEADLINE> Angola Calls for More Commercial Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of Angola's Economic and
Social Development Fund Paixao Franco has appealed for the
establishment of more commercial banks in Angola, as means to
provide "ample and effective" support for the national businesses,
the country's news agency Angop reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Franco made the statement on Monday in the central Kwanza-sul
Province, where he was paying a three-day visit, saying that the
country's financial system is imperfect and the country needs more
commercial banks to effectively serve the local businesses.
</P>
<P>
There are currently four commercial banks in the southwest
African country, namely the Savings and Credit Bank, the
Commercial and Industry Bank, the African Bank of Investment, and
the Commercial Bank of Angola.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that despite the bank shortage, the Angolan
government has created other financial institutions, to ease the
situation, with the productive sector as the priority in
government's plans.
</P>
<P>
Paixao Franco highlighted the importance of bank credits to the
development of businesses and the country's economic growth. He
added that his fund will possibly back the private sector by
granting credits to economic operators that come up with viable
projects.
</P>
<P>
According to Franco, the fund, which has the support from the
Angolan government, has an amount of 50 million U.S. dollars this
year to finance projects in the sectors of animal husbandry,
fisheries, transport, civil construction and industry.

<HEADLINE> Three Quarters of South Africans Positive About Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 30 (Xinhua) -- About three quarters of
South Africans were positive that the future would be happy for
all South Africans, according to a survey result made public here
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The biannual survey, conducted on a national basis, revealed
however that among minority groups of white, Indian and colored
people, a decreasing number indicated they were confident or
positive.
</P>
<P>
Among white and Indian South Africans, less than 50 percent
were confident, said the survey, conducted by Markinor, a polling
agency.
</P>
<P>
The result indicated that over the last year, perceptions that
race relations were improving declined and only three in every 10
white South Africans reported that they felt race relations were
improving.
</P>
<P>
The downward trend was present across all sectors of society,
but was most prevalent among whites and coloreds.
</P>
<P>
"The report found that the most likely cause of this
negativity is that these groups, together with Indians, are most
probably experiencing alienation grounded in perceived race
discrimination," the release said.
</P>
<P>
White and Indian groups also felt that standards and levels of
personal safety were deteriorating, according to the release.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Spends Over 200 Million U.S. Dollars in Congo War: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe had until June this year
spent slightly more than 10 billion Zimbabwean dollars (over 200
million U.S. dollars) on its military interventions in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Finance and Economic
Development Minister Simba Makoni told Parliament on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question by member of Parliament Tafadzwa
Musekiwa, Makoni said the country's economy could not sustain the
war any further hence the government's commitment in bringing the
soldiers back home at the shortest possible time.
</P>
<P>
Makoni said the DRC government had committed itself to
reimbursing Zimbabwe on the cost it was incurring in the war.
</P>
<P>
He said the commitment was based on trust, faith and confidence
between the two governments.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that some impetus would be put in the Lusaka
Peace Agreement and that the United Nations would speedily deploy
peacekeepers in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
"We hope our investment in peace will yield economic
opportunities for the region and the country itself," Makoni said.
</P>
<P>
The DRC war broke out two years ago and Zimbabwe was believed
to have about 11,000 soldiers in that country.

<HEADLINE> Two More Tutsi Parties Sign the Burundi Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Two more Tutsi parties
have put their signatures to the Burundi peace and reconciliation
agreement aimed at ending the seven-year civil war in the country,
bringing to six the number of the minority Tutsi parties which
have so far signed the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Mark Bomani, aide to the Burundi peace facilitator Nelson
Mandela, told Xinhua here on Wednesday that PRP and Av-Intwari
signed the accord on Tuesday, a day after the historic official
signing of a power-sharing deal by most of Burundi's political
factions in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha on Monday.
</P>
<P>
PRP and Av-Intwari, together with four other Tutsi parties,
boycotted the signing on ground that they had little time to go
through the final draft agreement delivered to them 20 minutes
before the signing.
</P>
<P>
Bomani said that he was optimistic the four Tutsi parties who
haven't signed will sign at last, adding the agreement is open for
signing within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
If they still refuse to sign the agreement, they will not be
given posts in the Burundian government and the National Assembly,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen of the 19 Burundian delegations involved in the Arusha
peace talks signed the accord on Monday in the presence of U.S.
President Bill Clinton and a number of African heads of state,
including the government of President Pierre Buyoya, the National
Assembly and the parties representing Burundi's majority ethnic
Hutus.
</P>
<P>
The accord calls for a three-year transitional period during
which democratic elections will be organized and Hutus will be
given equal representation in the army, which is currently
dominated by Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bomani disclosed that Mandela plans to start cease-
fire negotiations, which will involve the Burundian government and
the main Hutu rebel groups which did not take part in the Arusha
peace talks initiated by late Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere
in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic conflict between Hutu and Tutsi have left over 200,
000 people dead since 1993 when Tutsi paratroopers assassinated
the country's first elected Hutu president Melchior Ndadaye.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Tobacco Farmers Cut down Growing Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's tobacco farmers have
cut down growing areas by 20 percent for the next season largely
due to uncertainty resulting from compulsory land acquisitions for
resettlement of landless blacks, The Herald reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Flue-cured tobacco growers, the mainstay of the economy and
accounting for the bulk of the country's foreign currency earnings,
have reduced the areas from 75,000 hectares to 60,000 hectares as
the ongoing gazetting of farms for compulsory acquisition gives
them headaches, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Herald on Tuesday, Market Information
Director of the Zimbabwe Tobacco Association Pat Davis said the
decrease in the crop output from this season's 220 million
kilograms to around 180 million kilograms in the coming season
posed a serious threat to foreign currency earnings.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe depends on agriculture, especially tobacco, for
foreign currency earnings.
</P>
<P>
To date, 1,542 farms have been gazetted for compulsory
acquisition. An additional 684 farms are expected to be gazetted
this week.

<HEADLINE> Interview: New Somali Government not to Use Force: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Zhao Yi
</P>
<P>
DJIBOUTI, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Newly-elected Somali President
Abdiqasim Salad said here Tuesday that national reconciliation is
the most important policy of his government due to be established
in the coming 10 days.
</P>
<P>
"We do not think there is need to use force because the
majority of the people are for the unity of Somalia," Salad said
with confidence, stressing that "anybody who is against that will
of the people will be thrown out by the people themselves."
</P>
<P>
Salad, 58, who was elected as first Somali president on August
26 since Mohamed Siyad Barre regime was overthrown in 1991 and
sworn in two days later, indicated in an exclusive interview with
Xinhua that the new Somali government is willing to have dialogue
with different faction leaders and to solve the existing problems
through meaningful means.
</P>
<P>
However, the president categorically rejected the possibility
of allowing any continuation of secession in the country.
</P>
<P>
"We do not recognize the so-called 'Somaliland'. It is the
northern region of Somalia," he said, insisting that Somalia must
be a united country.
</P>
<P>
Salad, who served as interior minister under Barre, noted that
representatives of the two thirds of the people in the northern
regions are presented at the Somali Peace Conference which started
in Arta, Djibouti on May 2.
</P>
<P>
"They participated fully in the process of national
reconciliation. Therefore, the majority of the people of the north
are with this process, not with secession," he said.
</P>
<P>
On his plan to establish the central government, Salad said
that he will make appointment of prime minister of Somalia in
seven to 10 days.
</P>
<P>
The president quoted the Somali transitional charter as saying
that the future Somali prime minister will be a well-educated and
dynamic person.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the make-up of the cabinet, Salad said that the
transitional government is to have 25 ministers.
</P>
<P>
"We will appoint the ministers while we are in Djibouti, and
maybe, if the list is not complete, we will go back to Somalia to
finish there," he said.
</P>
<P>
Salad disclosed that he was planning to go back to Somalia and
visit Mogadishu, the capital of the country, very soon.
</P>
<P>
When asked what is his first thing to do when he is back to his
motherland, Salad said: "I am going to meet people, and to present
the result of the peace conference to the Somalis."
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the possible security problem for the people who
are returning home after the Somali Peace Conference, the
president admitted that it is not yet safe to travel inside the
country.
</P>
<P>
"However, there is nothing special against participants or the
peace conference. Everybody may face problems of security. But it
has become relatively calm in the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the interview, Salad also recalled the long-standing
friendly relationship between China and Somalia.
</P>
<P>
"China always supported the Somali government and people. The
foundation of the friendship was laid down by the late great
leader Zhou Enlai who visited Somalia in the early 1960s."
</P>
<P>
Salad said he also met with the late Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping when he visited China in 1977 as minister of information.
</P>
<P>
"I had best remembrance of the hard-working people in China.
And it is not only me but every Somali knows about China because
in addition to the projects of national theater and sport complex,
the Chinese government also helped Somalia in 1971 build a 1,040-
kilometer road which is the longest one in the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
"When I am thinking about reconstruction of Somalia, I always
have in mind the Chinese companies."
</P>
<P>
Finally, the president expressed his gratitude to China for its
support for the Somali peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to see the friendship between China and Somalia
to go through the transitional period," said Salad.
</P>
<P>
He said: "I would like to ask our Chinese friends to help us in
this period of history in any way possible. We want the Chinese
government to help the Somali government in any way possible."
</P>
<P>
"Long live the friendship between Somalia and China!" Salad
said in Chinese.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Should not Be Disbarred: Lawyers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Lawyers of U.S. President
Bill Clinton said Tuesday that the president should not be
disbarred over his testimony in the Paula Jones sexual harassment
case.
</P>
<P>
In response to a complaint filed by the Arkansas Supreme Court
Committee on Professional Conduct, Clinton's lawyers argued that
losing his law license is too harsh a penalty for him.
</P>
<P>
"On the basis of the relevant facts, the governing law and the
applicable decisions of the Arkansas courts ..., a sanction of
disbarment would be excessively harsh, impermissibly punitive and
unprecedented in the circumstances of this case," Clinton's
lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
The court committee sued President Clinton in June in a bid to
disbar him as a lawyer for denying his sexual contact with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
The committee charged that Clinton's conduct "damages the legal
profession and demonstrates a lack of overall fitness to hold a
license to practice law."
</P>
<P>
The president's lawyers Tuesday agreed with the state's claim
that Clinton was trying to save face when asked about Lewinsky,
but they argued that he "took actions motivated in part by a
desire to protect himself and others from embarrassment."
</P>
<P>
This is the first time an effort has been made to strip a
sitting president of his law license in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was impeached by the House and acquitted by the Senate
for his sexual scandal. He was also fined 90,000 dollars for
contempt of court by a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, a licensed lawyer since September 7, 1973, was
attorney general of Arkansas from 1977-79, but he has not
practiced law since the early 1980s.

<HEADLINE> African Countries to Discuss Parliamentary Role in Governance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from 16
sub-Saharan African countries are expected to discuss how their
parliaments can help strengthen governance in Africa, the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP) said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The discussion will be held after the fourth African Governance
Forum, hosted by UNDP, kicks off in the Ugandan capital of Kampala,
on September 1-3. The theme of this year's forum is the
contribution of the parliamentary process to strengthening
governance in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting the importance of the upcoming forum, UNDP
Administrator Mark Brown said, "Ineffective governance often short-
circuits the connection between anti-poverty efforts and poverty
reduction. That is why good governance built around strong,
transparent and democratic institutions is so important."
</P>
<P>
The African Governance Forum provides a platform for Africans,
international organizations and Africa's external development
partners to engage in dialogue on the state of governance on the
continent. It encourages discussion on issues often viewed as
vital to Africa's future.
</P>
<P>
In addition to participants from Africa, this year's forum also
includes participants from donor countries, inter-governmental
organizations, international and U.N. organizations, regional and
subregional institutions, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and
civil society.
</P>
<P>
The forum is part of the U.N. Special Initiative in Africa and
is spearheaded by UNDP and the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately, the African Governance seeks to stimulate the
transformation of policy into action to improve governance," said
Agostinho Zacarias of UNDP's Africa Policy Unit, the Africa-
oriented think tank of the U.N. agency.
</P>
<P>
The forum has four main objectives. They include:
</P>
<P>
-- Strengthening partnerships for improved governance based on
consensus-building among African governments, African civil
society organizations and external partners.
</P>
<P>
-- Raising awareness, exchanging information, and sharing
experience and best practices on governance among African
governments, and encouraging donor support for governance programs.
</P>
<P>
-- Stimulating concrete measures to respond to governance
issues within the countries, thereby strengthening coordination
and increasing resource mobilizing at the national level.
</P>
<P>
-- Creating an environment that supports resource mobilization
for follow-up programs in African countries.
</P>
<P>
The first African Governance Forum, held in the Ethiopian
capital of Addis Ababa in 1997, covered a broad spectrum of
governance issues and was supported by Norway.
</P>
<P>
The second Forum was held in Accra, capital of Ghana, in 1998,
with its focus on accountability and transparency. It was
supported by Norway, Switzerland and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Good governance and conflict management was the theme of the
third Forum in Bamako, capital of Mali, in 1999, which was backed
by Japan, Norway and Switzerland.

<HEADLINE> Northern Irish Girl Wounded in Paramilitary Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- An 11-year-old girl was wounded
Tuesday after her family's home was sprayed with gunfire as part
of an ongoing Protestant paramilitary feud in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Charlene Daly was sent to a hospital near the Northern Irish
city of Londonderry with a bullet lodged in her back.
</P>
<P>
The attack was blamed on the Ulster Volunteer Force. The UVF's
feud with the rival Ulster Defense Association already has left
three people dead and forced dozens of families from their homes,
mostly in the Shankill area of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
The two outlawed groups operate side-by-side in the same
impoverished Protestant communities, fighting over the lucrative
rackets they both operate rather than out of any political
ideology.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Bishop Calls for Purity of Religion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese bishop Michael Fu
Tieshan proposed here at the United Nations headquarters on August
29 to world religious leaders that all faiths in the world hold
high the banner of peace and safeguard the purity of religious
freedom.
</P>
<P>
The religious circles across the globe should also follow the
principles of religious forgiveness and reconciliation and create
an environment of harmonious co-existence, he said in a key-note
speech to the Millennium World Peace Summit of Religious and
Spiritual Leaders.
</P>
<P>
He put forward these propositions on behalf of the leaders of
Chinese Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Protestant and Catholic Churches,
who are present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We have noticed that in today's world, wars and poverty are
still running amok as in the past and mankind is still suffering
from unbearable agonies," he said.
</P>
<P>
In some regions where conflicts frequently occur, he said, the
religious leaders' painstaking efforts in appealing for peace have,
nevertheless, failed in the endless smoke of gunpowder and fire of
war.
</P>
<P>
"At present, there are still many violent and evil activities
going on 'in the name of religion'. Some people have made use of
religious differences to fuel ethnic feuds and provoke so-called
conflicts of civilizations; some want to trample upon the
sovereignty of other countries under the pretext of 'protecting
religious human rights,'" he said.
</P>
<P>
"Some people want to fish for fame by deceiving the world under
the cloak of religion and go in for separatist activities, and
there are even some people who have abused the name of religion by
desecrating religion and slaughtering lives," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As religions leaders, we feel extremely distress about all
these," he told the assembly of nearly 2,000.
</P>
<P>
He said that as advocated by various religions, benevolence,
fraternity, forgiveness and reconciliation represent a valuable
spiritual source for mankind to safeguard peace.
</P>
<P>
"Let us pray for the wisdom of the Holy Spirit, respect the
purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter, and from now on,
guard against and put an end to anything that taint and desecrate
religious purity," he said.
</P>
<P>
The bishop said, "We must face up to the differences in
religious beliefs and civilizations, respect each other and seek
common ground while reserving differences. And we should increase
exchanges and facilitate dialogues between various civilizations
and religious faiths, promote mutual understanding and realize
reconciliation."
</P>
<P>
"Do not do unto others what you do not want to be done unto
yourself, and we must oppose the idea and practice of 'imposing
upon others whatever you want,'" he said.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the participants on the religious situation in China,
Bishop Fu said that over several millennia, highlighting peace has
become the most important humanistic spirit in the traditional
Chinese culture, which has helped the Chinese nation to take an
open and tolerant stance toward different religions and different
cultures, he said.
</P>
<P>
The different religions in China have formed in such a tolerant
environment a good tradition of pursuing harmony and advocating
peace among each other. "Cruel religious war has never occurred in
the long history of China," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Today in China, facts and other practice genuinely reflect the
harmony between different religions. And under the protection of
the Constitution and other laws, we enjoy comprehensive and full
religious freedom," he said.

LONDON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The London and Paris markets
closed higher in thin trading Tuesday as dealers waited for an
expected interest rate rise by the European Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
London's benchmark FTSE 100 index closed up 22.6 points or 0.34
percent at 6,586.3 points, having once again poked its nose above
resistance at 6,600 before losing its nerve.
</P>
<P>
Technology shares led gainers, with Energis up 7.8 percent, and

</P>
<P>
OM Group's hostile bid, worth 1.2 billion U.S. dollars, was

pushed LSE shares 350 pence or 14.7 percent higher, to 2,725 pence
based on a quoted Cazenove.
</P>
<P>
German DAX closed 44.82 points or 0.61 percent lower at 7,294.

<HEADLINE> Britain Plans to Speed Up Debt Relief Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The British government Tuesday
pledged to break down barriers preventing the debt slates of the
world's poorest countries being wiped clean, but said some states
still had to get their own houses in order.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said International Development Secretary Clare
Short will meet with Chancellor of the Exchequer (Finance Minister)
Gordon Brown in Washington Wednesday for talks with the chiefs of
the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
"Gordon and I will do everything in our power to get rid of (
the debt) but we have got problems in some of the countries where
their governments have no interest in improving the lives of their
poor," Short told BBC radio.
</P>
<P>
Short said she was hopeful that some countries like Zambia,
Rwanda, Malawi and Mali could be fast-tracked onto an
international debt relief program agreed by the world's major
industrialized nations last year.
</P>
<P>
But she said some other countries, such as Myanmar and Sudan,
were either "very corrupt or deeply engaged in conflict."
</P>
<P>
"It wouldn't help the poor people in their countries at all to
just give them debt relief," the international development
secretary said.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks End Mixed With Dow Falling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended mixed
Tuesday with the blue chip stocks falling on profit-taking. The
technology shares rose.
</P>
<P>
At the close of session, the Dow Jones industrial average fell
37.74 at 11,215.10 points, retreating from a six-session rally.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mixed. The technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index rose 11.58 at 4,082.17 while the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index was down 4.25 at 1,509.84.
</P>
<P>
Stocks traded as two separate reports showed conflict signals
on the U.S. economy. The Conference Board, a prominent business
research group, said in a survey that its Consumer Confidence
Index dipped to 141.1 in August from a revised 143.0 in July,
indicating that Americans were less confident about the health of
the economy but remain optimistic with future growth prospects.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said in a separate report that new home
sales jumped 14.7 percent in July, the biggest rise in seven years.
The report showed that consumers were upbeat to keep spending.
</P>
<P>
Investors moved some money out of the industrial sector to lock
in profits from a rally in the previous six sessions, dragging the
Dow index lower. Financial services stocks including Citigroup and
American Express were down.
</P>
<P>
But the Nasdaq index was helped to move higher by big
technology names. Oracle, Cisco Systems and Dell Computer rose.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 1.82 at 673.44 and the American Stock
Exchange index fell 1.49 at 933.48. But the Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 3.15 at 529.63.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers narrowly on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 1,502 down, 1,335 up and 542 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 783.37 million shares from 722.92
million in the previous session.

LUSAKA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Zambian police Wednesday arrested
over 30 students from the University of Zambia who were charged
with inciting violence in the campus.
</P>

The police fired teargas to disperse students who protested
against what they called high accommodation fees.
</P>

Four vehicles were stoned and damaged in the violence, a police
officer said.
</P>
<P>
Last evening, students of the university blocked Great East
Road along which they hurled stones on passing vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Some witnesses said that several cars had their windscreens
shattered and one passenger sustained injuries.

<HEADLINE> More People to be Resettled Before Rain Season: Zambian Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Lands and Agriculture
and Resettlement Minister Joseph Made Wednesday said the
government will successfully resettle people on 5 million hectares
of land before the onset of the rain season.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question of a parliamentarian, Made said among
the 5 million hectares the government intended to acquire, only 2.
1 million hectares were suitable for cropping while the 2.9
million hectares were for livestock production.
</P>
<P>
He dispelled speculation that agricultural production would go
down because of the fast track land program, saying that most of
the country's 75 percent prime arable land under the control of
the whites was being underutilized.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Made said communal farmers could be brought in to
the commercial farming sector without pushing the present
commercial farmers out of business.
</P>
<P>
The minister said if commercial farmers scaled down their
operations, that could not be attributed to the government.
</P>
<P>
Made said his ministry was working with the private sector and
non-governmental organizations to come up with a policy that would
complement the fast track land program.

LUSAKA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-five Zambian fishermen
abducted last Saturday by rebels fighting the government of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have been released, Home
Affairs Minister Peter Machungwa said here Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, five boats of the fishermen have also been
released, but one fisherman was still not included, said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
He said that his country secured the release of the 25 Zambians
after negotiations with the abductors. The rebels demanded
undisclosed amount of money from the Zambian government for their
release.
</P>
<P>
However, Machungwa did not say whether the demand was met
before the release.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, a total of 29 Zambian fishermen were blown into
the water of the DRC by strong wind while they were fishing in
their own country's side. After they were abducted by the rebels,
three of them were released earlier so that they could come back
to report the situation and the rebel's demand for money.
